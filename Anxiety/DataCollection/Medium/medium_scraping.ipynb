      "[1, 'https://medium.com/@corinnasee/its-wednesday-and-i-m-dreading-going-back-to-work-401a5cd65461', 'It’s Wednesday, And I’m Dreading Going Back To\\xa0Work', '2020-01-01', 'I like my job. But I also think I’ve never quite dreaded a job as much as I sometimes dread this one. I remember when I worked at the gym, I was saying to a coworker one day, “It’s really hard to find a job you don’t dread coming to every day” or “that you don’t feel like you need to take time away from” and that’s what it was like to work there. Here…I sometimes dread going, and I often feel like I might need to take time away, because I can feel the stress getting to me. Those were pretty few and far between, though, which is good because I wasn’t even in a program that would warrant such stress. I didn’t study law. I wasn’t pre-med. I studied Creative Writing and French, had a great group of friends, and really enjoyed my college experience. Even when I had a part-time job there, and commuted an hour each way every day, I did well in my classes and the stakes were fairly low. But they didn’t always feel low, and that’s the trouble I had. There’s no shame in having a hard time, and there’s no shame in asking for help. I remember one English class I took with a difficult professor. His three exams were very hard, and he even told us that the majority of his students would make up for their exam grades on the weekly short essays and the one long essay each semester. There was also opportunity for extra credit at the end of the semester. Multiple chances for redemption, really. But one low exam grade — not a failing grade, just a C or a D — sent me into a tailspin of anxiety, and my mom, who happened to be home at the time, found me sobbing on my bed in a state of panic and she gave me a Xanax to calm me down. A panic attack was as bad as it got, and I didn’t have many of those. But I had frequent anxiety attacks, without realizing that’s what they were. Knots in my stomach. Sensations that I couldn’t breathe, that I wasn’t getting enough oxygen. Hindsight is 20/20, and a bad exam grade, or even a less than stellar grade in a class, was not going to make or break my entire future. There was no chance that it would, but even if I could see that at the time, that’s not how I felt. I know now that the stress I experienced then was more self-imposed than anything: a product of my state of mind rather than a product of my circumstances. But today, the stakes are higher. This is my job. It’s my responsibility to find the stories, get the information, and turn them into something worthy of being printed and distributed to the tens of thousands of people who read the county newspaper every day. And if I don’t do that…I don’t know what we might fill the space with, and I would be letting down my coworkers and my managers—people who hired me because they believed I could and would handle it. I can’t afford to not handle it. I know that I’m capable, and maybe that’s what I need to focus my time and energy on — that belief, and continually proving it, if only just to myself. But deadlines are looming, and the knot in my stomach twists tighter as the minutes tick away. What if no one calls me back in time and I can’t get the information I need? What if I can’t get it turned in in time? What if I’m not cut out for this after all? What if— I can’t handle the what ifs. My fiancé pointed out that nobody gets to decide whether I’m cut out for this job, except me. He’s right. My boss isn’t going to fire me just because I run into some roadblocks trying to get the information I need, or because I have a harder time sometimes finding feature stories than others. What I should do is ask for help and advice. I’m still learning — and I know I’ve done well so far because I’ve been told as much. There’s no shame in having a hard time, and there’s no shame in asking for help. There’s no shame in feeling anxious about having to go to work today. I get stressed out extremely easily — some of these deadlines I’m so worried about even have two weeks left, which is more than enough time to schedule the interviews and write the stories. I know that, because I’ve done it multiple times already. I know that I’m capable, and maybe that’s what I need to focus my time and energy on—that belief, and continually proving it, if only just to myself. It’s Wednesday, and I have a lot to do today. Two stories are due this evening, and one I can write already, while the other I have to track down and figure out. Step one: taking a deep breath. It’s going to be fine. Because I can do this.']\n",
      "[118, 'https://medium.com/@elijahmoss/aperitif-bee6e31fede0', 'APERITIF', '2020-01-06', 'It is your birthday today and there is an opulent tableau that has been meticulously arranged to exalt this momentous occasion. Your entire family has been gathered to greet your arrival effusively. The platform where they are all standing on is a luminous octagonal platform where the edges are spangled with pastel yellow-and-white flora, the stage itself radiantly exuding virginal undertones. There is one sibling accompanying your parents who you were otherwise unaware had existed until this encounter. Your whole family is greeting you with rictus grins and joyously histrionic weeping that is choreographed to be seen from afar. It is a strikingly poignant scene that welcomes your arrival. Does it make you feel nervous? Your feet are gliding briskly down the cobalt-blue velveteen-carpeted aisle toward the idyllic image of your family. A galleon fleet of variegated balloons are released into the oceanic sky above. The slender clouds which devour the wandering birthday balloon envoys are supple, sparsely streaked lines of chalk across a clear empyrean expanse. Flanking opposite sides of the aisle, everyone you have ever known is present as well, stolidly supervising the event. Your personal history is an amalgamation of all these familiar faces and your family’s misplaced expectations. Each successive step forward only draws you backwards two additional steps as you are tunneling through this recursive mirage of distance and motion. The scene of your arrival at the platform is a beautiful procession full of splendor and jubilant frivolity amongst everyone here. It is your birthday and everyone is sheathed with the same static smile. What a riveting sight, you might observe dreamily to yourself as you come nearer. Approaching the precipice adjoining the orthogonal platform where your family is still waiting for you to join them onstage, there is a diverse collection of women adorned lavishly in maiden’s gowns. You recognize these lilting, ethereal women as your former lovers, who are incidentally also present to celebrate this annual rite of passage into maturity. They are gifting you with necklaces that are ringed with severed penises, lowering them adoringly round your neck as they sway past you in a mesmerizing twirl. You recognize the bloodied parts decoratively circling your neck as belonging to the men who they had once chosen to be your successor as a lover. The men who had the temerity to challenge your impeccable prowess as a suitor. You accept these gifts, even though the feminine elegance of your former lovers causes your nerves to shudder furtively in revulsion. Surveying the stained-glass skyline once more, you see five fighter jet-planes glissading themselves swiftly behind you in a haze of propulsive exhaust fumes and glittering confetti. Are you feeling overwhelmed? Please do not get squeamish at this pivotal hour. Everyone is watching you, attentively might I add. You are now finally ascending the steps leading up to the extraordinarily bright platform where you will join your family. Contrasted harshly against the luminescence, the combined silhouette of your family (consisting of one father, one mother, and one sibling who has been unbeknownst to you until this revelatory moment) are all dark spots languishing dimly within the smoldering sepia of your vision. And then this scene is reversed. Your feet are shuffling downwards a few steps away from the octagonal platform where you family is still waiting expectantly for you to join them onstage. The reversion has now made the combined silhouette of your family blisteringly solarized, a trifecta illuminating the darkling interpolation that permeates the surface underfoot. Cycling alternately between these two polarizing filters for perceiving this interval where you are procrastinating this convergence back within the loving orbit of your family is making you feel excruciatingly anxious. The immense trepidation you have approaching this lavish altar of your family magnetized together as an indivisible nucleus. The surrounding crowd consisting of everyone you have ever know you is judiciously observing the cumbersome poise of your ascent. You are blinking rapidly, as if you have just been saved from drowning. You regain your composure and then doggy paddle meekly onward. After much agonizing delay, you have now reached the summit of the octagonal platform and have been warmly absorbed into the tessellating still-life portrait of your family. You now have a full panoramic view of everyone who has assembled into a congregation below the precipice. You recognize many of the individuals who are here, some who you have even dreaded to be here today. It is your grandiloquent birthday and everyone is witnessing you undertake the enormity of this occasion, including those select few that you view unfavorably. Such luminaries featured among the crowd include, but of course are not limited to: the community college composition instructor who you had a sensory meltdown in front of due to dangerously extensive experimentation with mind-altering substances. Your ninth-grade ROTC drill sergeant who once declared that you would never amount to anything socially redeemable, and as you can recall, with some damning finality. Every drug dealer you have ever been acquainted with is here as well, no matter how tenuous your past relationship with them has been. The kids who grew up with you in your childhood neighborhood who would ruthlessly attack and emasculate you every day after school. Even the boy from middle school who you had your first homoerotic experience with is also inexplicably here, for some reason. Everyone is here, looking at you with a newly kindled piquancy, an inscrutable fascination toward observing every minute movement you make during your birthday. Is it all too much stimulus for you to process at one simultaneous instance? You are suddenly struck with a vertiginous feeling of free fall, standing precariously above this wavy sea of scrutinizing eyes crosscutting every action you make across the aisle and onto the octagonal platform. You start hyperventilating amid all of this sensorial commotion. You can sigh in relief. After all, you are safely ensconced within the security of your family’s aura. It is what binds you to the translucent-tiled flooring of the octagonal platform, your only tethering betwixt this weightless event. Glancing back inquisitively at the assembled congregation once more, you see your former lovers saunter into view in a serpentlike trance, moseying around all the stolid faces and tailored formal wear and polished signets of the crowd in sashaying white Gallic dresses patterned with paisleys. This tranquil group of your former lovers look cherubic underneath the glare emitting from the fractal sunlight. Their gently disciplined footwork pacifies everyone, including you and your family. Your father watchfully supervises the same pastoral scenes of your lilting former lovers behind you like a golemesque sentry. He comments on how impressive it is that you have been able to string together such a gorgeous gallery of women during the romantic escapades of your formative years, and yet somehow still neglect to have any of these relationships culminate into anything meaningful aside from your own arousal. Wasted sperm by a wasteful child, your mother admonishes you in tandem with your father’s criticisms. A child sadly afflicted with indolence since birth. Both of your parents are now pointing out how demonstrably wrong all of your decisions have been so far. They only do this because they love you. You insist to them that you’re still not attracted to women, that this is unlikely to ever change, and overall you still have massive regrets about participating in the act of coitus with the opposite sex. You tell them that these ersatz episodes of experimenting with heterosexuality have been somewhat detrimental to your own sense of mental wellbeing. Your mother laughs dismissively to your churlish rebuttal. It is only a phase, she consoles you using a patronizing octave. These feelings will some day subside, clearing up any confusion you may still be having. I blame the left-wing academia for brainwashing your poor impressionable head with such nonsense like ‘autonomy’ and ‘biopolitics’ or ‘sexual repression’. These subversives actively conspire to destroy our sacred way of living. Sometimes I really wish you never bothered going to college. It would of saved me and your father a lot of hassle and money if you just would of went to a trade school and were taught an apprenticeship for an actual profession. The sun-lengthened shadow of your father looms over you in an imposing isosceles like an obelisk raised from sand-scorched earth. You can feel the crushing intensity beaming down at you from his magnitude. He is the baleful patriarch displeased with the proceedings transpiring at hand. You palpably detect that you are the disruptive blemish tarnishing this otherwise holistic family tableau. And then everyone is back to elated laughter, ringing sharply into your ears. You are flummoxed by this but you still try laughing along with them, albeit nervously. Amid this sudden, disjointed eruption of levity, your father reaches below and then goes on to scoop a handful of your mother’s face into his enormous fist. Generously, you father then passes the evenly segmented chunk of your mother’s face, offering it to you to eat. Examining it closer, the removed flesh is spongy, richly densified with batter and buttermilk icing. You look back at the disfigured profile of your mother, and she is still smiling but now without eyes or ears or cheeks or a nose. Your mother is made of cake and you are scarfing down the morsels carved from your mother’s sugary face, because it is your birthday today and your family loves you so dearly. Savoring the plentiful bite of your mother’s gelatinous face, you discover that it is the sweetest thing you have ever tasted. It is creamy dissolving against your tongue. For some subliminal reason that you cannot explain, you resent your mother for being endowed with such sumptuously soft and pillowy layers of flesh. The aftertaste this realization creates inside your mouth is sickeningly saccharine, your taste buds collapsing wordlessly into indigestible mush. You swallow it all down with a strained gulp, trying not to ruin your appetite any further from the moist remnants of your mother’s face squished between your fingers. Sated at the moment from eating your mother like a lard-frosted birthday cake, you turn around and begin to examine the presence of the sibling accompanying your parents who you have never met, or have known to exist beforehand. The novelty of your brand new sibling only increases your curiosity further once you deduce that they are a woman. This is your sister, a ravishing enigma uncovered from underneath the oscillating shadow of your family. You make eye contact with your sister searchingly, albeit with extreme trepidation. It is your birthday and everyone is watching you awkwardly stare at your sister. Are you beginning to feel unwell? Indigestion, perhaps? Settle down your inchoate nervousness, child. Your mother was the aperitif preceding the alluring entree that is your sister. It is admittedly an acquired taste for your selectively discriminatory palette, but at the tacit approval of your father you resign yourself dutifully to ravaging her because it is your birthday and everyone must witness you penetrate your sister and your father is looking at your coupling approvingly and your mother is still smiling brightly without eyes or cheeks or ears or a nose. You enmesh yourself reluctantly into the atavistic moebius strip that is your sister’s vulva, the frothy orifice petaled vermilion that is ripening into a felicitous bronze. You enfold yourself deeper into the mysteries of her flesh, everyone and your family watching you consummate this incestuous pact. Your sister is a stone well and you are plummeting down into recesses unknown. Are you having a good time yet? Everyone here has worked specially hard to give you such a memorable birthday. They took exacting care into coordinating this event, all just for your own edification. Remember to thank everyone who attended before you depart back home! They didn’t have to do all this. They could of abandoned you long ago, considering how frustratingly obstinate you have been in the past.']\n"
