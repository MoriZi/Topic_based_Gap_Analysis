Red wine while I cooked dinner, whiskey while I got ready to go out, more wine for an afternoon in the park. Every occasion revolved around drinking. I felt fatigued. Around the holidays, many peers started talking about doing “sober January”. The first thought in my head was, “Wow, that sounds really hard.” That thought led to the realization that if it seemed hard, maybe it was necessary. This time last year, I decided to attempt a sober January. As January started, yoga classes replaced the hours I would have spent drinking with friends. I spent my 34th birthday on Saturday, January 13th, organizing my kitchen and listening to podcasts. I felt myself drawn to more philosophical content such as On Being by Krista Tippett and I couldn’t get enough social justice news from Pod Save The People by Deray Mckesson. I read books even more voraciously than before. Three favorites from the start of 2018 were Sing, Unburied Sing by Jesmyn Ward, Red Clocks by Leni Zumas, and The Immortalists by Chloe Benjamin. You can see my complete reading list from 2018, 64 books total, on my Goodreads account. I rested more. I isolated myself and kept myself busy so I wouldn’t be tempted to drink. After three weeks with no alcohol, about 75 percent of my anxiety and depression symptoms went away. Everyday used to include erratic mood swings. I would feel elated and edgy for a few hours, only to crash down to feeling sad and sluggish for no reason. The smallest annoyance would set me off and make my heart beat faster. I had been suffering from these vacillations from anxiety to depression for a decade. I had accepted them as part of me. I thought I was just an overly emotional and dramatic person. When February rolled around, I realized I didn’t want to start drinking again. I had stepped back from partying for long enough to see how it had negatively impacted me. I didn’t want to risk losing this peace I had just started to discover. I felt small pangs of FOMO as summer passed and I saw Instagram posts of friends drinking the day away at the park. My family vacation was challenging, as I come from a clan of enthusiastic drinkers. As my family members delighted in enjoying daytime beach cocktails, I sometimes felt listless. What was I supposed to do with myself? In September, I attended my first big concert at the Greek Theatre since I had stopped drinking. Being in the loud, chilly stadium, surrounded by enthusiastic revelers was pretty triggering for me. I realized there are some pieces of the concert experience that can make one uncomfortable. The slow, melancholy sounds of the band The National didn’t help contribute to my vulnerable mood. Old Ali would make sure to maintain a constant buzz at a concert, to soften the annoyances around her. Sober Ali needed to learn to just deal with it. As the months passed, I realized the only time I really had the urge to drink was when I was upset about something. I was able to observe how I had been using alcohol as my coping mechanism to deal with any part of life that made me sad, stressed, or uncomfortable. Taking this break allowed me to view the patterns and habits I had developed over the years. It gave me the perspective I needed to view my unhealthy relationship with alcohol. It led me to realize that this “break” with drinking should become permanent. Other great byproducts from quitting booze: I used to have to take allergy medicine every night but my allergies went away. Replacing drinking time with yoga classes has toned and strengthened my body in ways I didn’t realize were possible. I can feel that I am in the best athletic shape of my life. My skin has aged backwards about five years and looks amazing. I fall asleep as soon as my head hits the pillow and I sleep soundly for eight hours and bounce awake well rested. I frequently enjoy watching the sunrise. NO HANGOVERS! I feel like I have so much more time to accomplish things I want to do. I feel like my brain is more clear and functioning at a higher level. My patience has dramatically increased. My ability to focus and connect with my friends and clients has intensified. 2018 was challenging. I separated from my husband after eleven years together. I moved out of the charming North Beach apartment I had lived in with him for a decade. I suffered a shoulder injury on Muni that I will have to deal with for the rest of my life. I found out my beloved salon was closing down and I needed to find a new place to work. I have gone through so much in my personal life this year. I can’t imagine how hard this year would have been if I was still drinking and dealing with the vicious cycle of hangovers and mood swings. Every day, I remind myself that I’m brave. I’m strong. I’m not afraid to face new challenges. When I share my experience with friends and clients, they often ask if quitting drinking has changed my social life. I always reply, “yes.” I had been going hard for a decade, I didn’t realize it, but I was ready for a more restful life. I still see my friends, just in the context of casual dinners at home, yoga classes, book clubs and walks in the park. I go out once in a while and still enjoy socializing. I don’t find it difficult or tempting to be around drinking because I feel so amazing, I wouldn’t trade it. I do miss red wine when I’m attending book club or dining at a nice restaurant but I’m 4/20 friendly so I’ll still take the edge off with cannabis here and there when I feel the urge to imbibe. I wanted to share this experience in case I can be helpful. I have found it so valuable to hear about others’ struggles with mental health issues and if you have similar challenges, you are not alone. I truly didn’t realize how negatively my drinking habits were impacting my mental health until I decided to take a break. I’m so grateful I made this decision and I’m so proud of myself that I have made it a whole year without alcohol! I turn 35 in a few weeks and I am excited to see what this new year will bring for this new Ali.']\n",
