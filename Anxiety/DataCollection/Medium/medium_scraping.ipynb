I wrote this blog in 2012 and it first appeared on my website The Midlife Coach. I stand by much of what I wrote back then, I’m grateful that the stigma is easily and that mental health is much more easily spoken about. We still have a way to go to get parity of understanding with physical health. 6 years later I wrote a follow up blog on what I was seeing differently. You can find it here. I’ve been shying away from this post for some time now. You know I don’t avoid tough subjects. Depression is one of those subjects. I am well and have been for many years now, that however, wasn’t always the case. My intention in writing about depression is to share my experiences frankly and openly in the hope that something inspires or supports another going through their own private hell. Depression is a serious illness. It is a mental illness that sadly carries a huge stigma. It frustrates me that people are fearful, those with it and society at large. If you have a heart condition, diabetes or a broken leg you wouldn’t dream of not attending to it, taking advice from experts on how to repair the damage. No one is going to call you weak if you are unable to fix your broken leg. Then why is it that so often I hear people saying they won’t see a professional therapist in order to gain an insight into their troubled mind, or they won’t take medication for depression to help them begin to make sense of where they are. Depression is not about feeling sad. It is not about feeling a bit down or being in a bad mood. Depression is a blackness. Depression sucks all emotion from you. You are left feeling hollow and numb and with a deep sense of hopelessness and loneliness. Depression drains the world of colour and sound and taste and smell. I have experienced some very black and bleak places in my mind. I spent some of my teenage years with depression. I suffered chronic post natal depression and I suffered again as I was battling with a deteriorating marriage. There were days when I could barely get out of bed. I went around in some sort of coma. I would have panic attacks collecting the children from school. I couldn’t face anyone, especially those closest to me. At times I couldn’t even speak, such was my fear of opening the flood gates of my tears. I lost a huge amount of weight. I developed asthma and I had tonsillitis permanently. Simple, every day tasks became my very own Everest……and still I battled on. I have spent time getting myself to where I am today. I have taken medication and I have spent time with a variety of therapists. All these helped me piece my life back together again. Today, I know the triggers and I know how to handle it. That’s not to say that I live my life in a perpetual state of nirvana. I’m realistic yet I won’t let a ‘blue’ day affect me in the devastating way it used to. “You are not alone in this, as brothers we will stand and hold your hand.” — Mumford & Sons. Here are my thoughts on what helped me through those bleak periods and keep me focused today. I make no claim to be an expert, these are simply some ideas that may in turn give you strength. Take your pick and create your own too. Depression would not be my lifestyle of choice! However, even though writing this blog has brought back some excruciating memories I am grateful for the experiences I had. I am the woman I am today because of my experiences, ALL my experiences — the good, the bad and the down right ugly. If this blog has inspired you in anyway do let me know.

I have been riding the Lithium train for 12 years on and off. It gives me stability and it also rids me of most of my emotions. This is not usually a problem, unless I am in a situation where emotions are useful. I have talked about feeling nothing at weddings and such. I feel nothing on a daily basis though. This does have it’s toll on me. I can become slightly disconnected from the world around me. These feeling are made all the worse in times of stress or low sleep. I might not have a link to my emotions but I really do feel stress and anxiety. My dose of Lithium is not unusual, these side-effects I am experiencing aren’t uncommon but does that make it right? I realise I am not allowed to be a danger to myself or to others. It seems to me that I am being over medicated because that’s the closest best option the NHS are willing to look at. I have been through most meds, I have co-operated well over the past 5 years, note the 7 year difference from my first medication! I wasn’t always a good patient. I wasn’t willing to give up who I am. I relented and came to the conclusion that on Lithium I am who I am only more stable. I still agree with that up to a point, and the point being is anybody who they really are without an appropriate emotional response?']\n",

As a result of the lifestyle we live nowadays, anxiety symptoms can show up in all of us. You may not recognize them right away but the symptoms of anxiety are pretty obvious once you know what to look for. Controlar Tu Ansiedad-CLICK AQUI/Control Your Anxiety-CLICK HERE So how do we tell when a person has already been experiencing anxiety to some degree? It can be confusing to diagnose properly if we are really honest. Fortunately this guide can help you to identify some of the most common symptoms of anxiety. Controlar Tu Ansiedad-CLICK AQUI/Control Your Anxiety-CLICK HERE There are some myths about anxiety that are commonly perpetuated in society. Some people think that their anxiety is a health condition and they are sick, this is not true. In reality in most cases anxiety is emotional, not physical. Even though a panic attack can strike and make a person feel like they are having a heart attack they are merely experiencing the effects of adrenaline coursing through their nervous system. This is the body’s natural response to fearful thoughts in the subconscious. This fight or flight response is very important for keeping us safe in emergencies but unfortunately some people’s brains have trouble differentiating between fantasy and imminent danger, therefore their fearful thoughts cause the body to respond as if it were actually in a real situation that called for an adrenal reaction. You will find 2 kinds of anxiety. The initial kind could be the emotional nervousness and the 2nd may be the physical anxiety feelings. Typically the most common psychological anxiety symptoms are displayed as follows: Controlar Tu Ansiedad-CLICK AQUI/Control Your Anxiety-CLICK HERE Aside from struggling to relate to this emotional anxiousness you may also be afflicted by actual nervousness. Those who have anxiety can also be prone to the physical panic attack along with the bodily signs or symptoms that follow. * You tend to be perspiration heavily. * You cannot get enough proper sleep. * Feelings associated with wooziness or dizziness. * You experience nausea. * Frequent urinating. * Fatigue. * Headache. * Heart pounding. So why does anxiety occur? Nervousness can show up without any forewarning but anxiety is actually brought about simply by our thoughts and the stresses that exist in our daily lives. Sometimes these anxiety attacks will feel like the worst thing in the world. You may even think you are having a heart attack and are dying. This is never the case though. Understanding the symptoms of anxiety or ansiedade sintomas and panic attacks can help you manage your own anxiety and also assist your loved ones who struggle with the same things. There are many options for managing and overcoming anxiety. Visit our site at [http://www.whitedischarge.net] to learn more about how you can take back control of your life.

I have nothing to offer but speculation and hope. I am trying to remain positive, because what’s the point of being negative? If the Twins are your team, go ahead and show it by sticking with them through good times and bad. My childhood memories were made on “bad baseball”, I went to Twins games at the METRODOME when there were CONTRACTION talks, so don’t try to tell me that this is the worst. We have more to be thankful for, and maybe, just maybe, the positive vibes in the stands will flow over the limestone walls and the players will use it like a wave to propel them to new heights. Well, I guess I should put the finishing touches on this post. First, before the “thank you” section, I have a couple “sorrys”. Sorry for the long-winded “fluff post”, I really have no new news because of my lack of attendance at Twins games. It’s just the way our 20 game package split. I’ll have plenty of games in September! Also, I am sorry if my previous post was too non-baseball-y for you. However, I do feel like mental health is very important and yes, it’s mainly for my own well-being and something important to me because it affects ME. I won’t always bring up non-baseball stuff, but since I had a dead period and an open platform, I thought “what better time than now?” Please, tell me what you think of the non-baseball banter; would you read it, will you skip it, do you HATE it? Like I said earlier, when I have baseball stories I will probably just focus on those, but during the down time I might drift. I might also cover some non-baseball stuff if it turns into part of the baseball story. Now for the “thank you” part of the show. Thank you dear reader(s?)! Please, feel free to introduce yourself and let me know what you enjoy or other aspects you would like to hear more/less about. I don’t expect that I actually have regular readers, but if you happened across this blog and want to hear more from me, I’d like to know. My goal is to get better at this whole blogging thing, and provide some good insight into what it’s like to be a ballhawk and Twins fan, as well as make it a bit personal and humorous.

Talking is a great way to minimize your anxiety/worry/stress. Since I have had these larger attacks in my past I have also seen a doctor, therapist, and recently started medication. I was concerned about medication, but I know that the sooner I get this under control, the better my life will be and the longer I can live, since stress, anxiety, and depression have shown to be contributing factors to heart problems. Long story made short: Talk about your problems with someone. It doesn’t have to be this public or open, but know that there are people out there that face similar issues and can understand and possibly help. It’s time to take back your sanity, don’t keep it all bottled up until things are bad. Baseball an life are similar, their both 90% mental. Stay in the game, keep your mind health!

Thank you to my parents and rest of my family for taking phone calls at random times and getting me through those episodes. Thank you to my season ticket holder buddy Jared and his fiancée Megan. They both have helped me understand some things about anxiety that they have learned in their own lives.

Pithy! This anxiety was even more destructive than my word count anxiety because it literally kept me stuck for months. In one case I had spent so much time (which I now realize was time spent procrastinating) on a few particular passages, massaging the prose, thinking that I was perfecting it when what I was really doing was overworking it, like an old dog works a bone over and over and over until it actually starts to get a little smaller. Not only did I waste time by overworking the passages, but also, because I had spent so much time tinkering, those were parts of the book that I refused to give up — after all, I had spent so much time on them, if I pitched them, I would be wasting that time. Trouble was, they were pivotal points in a plot that needed drastic revisions in order to make sense and the revisions would mean that those points would have to go away. It’s possible that my months of fallowness were the result of other factors, including crazy hours at my day job, but I am now convinced that part of the blockage was those over-loved passages. Because once I decided how I was going to reshape the plot and then let them go, the new plot came together really quickly. There are two morals to this story. One is that just as you have to sometimes let go of word count to allow new word count to grow, sometimes you have to let go of plot points to let new plot points develop, and you have to just take the loss on the time you spent ‘perfecting’ the parts you later scrap. The other moral is that once you develop the skill to write well, you can write well today, tomorrow and every day after that. So, there’s no reason to hang on to your “good writing” for fear that that’s the last of it. It’s like hoarding and we all know that hoarding is never healthy.

As I get closer to my birthday, I’m starting to reflect on how much I’ve grown over the last 29 years. One major change that has helped me overcome much of my anxiety is adopting faith in the fact that everything will work out. In my darkest times, I used to panic when the littlest thing would go wrong. I remember one day when I was 19, when my old Volvo 240 turbo suddenly lost power while driving down a busy street in LA, I freaked out and called my Mom, sobbing. I wasn’t in any danger. I just had to pull to the side of the road and figure it out. It was that simple. But because of the attachment I had to the idea that things must go a certain way, I shattered when they didn’t. If something doesn’t go your way, or the unexpected threatens to shove you against the wall enough to knock you out, do you hold onto the faith that things will work out? I ask because this is the key to how you handle life. As much as we’d love to control every situation we get thrown into, the truth is that all we can control is how we react to situations. But that’s old news, right? I say that all the time. What I want to talk about today is the belief that it will all work out, and ways to keep that faith even in your darkest times so you can find the light faster. Today’s post is about actively keeping faith in your own life. Today’s post is about not giving up, crumbling, or letting the challenges we’re faced with overcome us. Today is the day you stand up strong and allow challenges to come your way, knowing that you’ll come out stronger on the other side. In addition to keeping the faith, I’ve listed some things to remember that will make your life flow much easier along with that belief. By remembering the tips listed here, you can ensure that you too can stay strong in even the toughest situations. When you’re focused on the worst possible outcome, you’re more likely to fulfill those fears. Remember when we talked about self-fulfilling prophecies? They’re the real deal. Pull that post out again and read up on how to avoid them. Faith requires effort just like taking action does (which we’ll talk about in a sec here). If you know you’re pre-disposed to Eeyore-type thinking, it might require a bit more effort on your part to stay positive. When you notice yourself start to drift toward the woe-is-me worry-wart mindframe, stop yourself, then redirect those thoughts in a positive direction. What is the best possible scenario? Are you taking action to create that outcome? Luck is something you create through action and interpretation of what life deals to you. Make yourself the luckiest person you know. This applies to pessimistic and optimistic ideas of what the future holds. You have no control over some things that add to the outcome of whatever you’re working toward. As much work as you can put into anything in your life, there reaches a certain point at which you must give up control. If you don’t, you could drive yourself mad. Much of our frustration, anxiety, worry and depression comes from the fact that we try to control the things we simply cannot control. Have faith that it will work out, yes, but don’t force it to happen the way you see it happening… Often times, life throws the unexpected at us. If you keep an open mind, those unexpected events can seem more like possibilities than obstacles. Start viewing the unexpected as opportunities to accomplish your goals in a new way. Things work themselves out in ways we could never plan for. Keep the door open, and allow the unexpected to open doors you never saw before. Just like when my car lost power, you too can take the time to pull over to keep from freaking out. If I had just taken a second to pull over and take a breath, I would have realized that I was in no danger, that this would work itself out and no one would be all that affected. Take the time to pull over and get grounded again. Take some deep breaths. Take a time out. Close your eyes and ask, “Where is the opportunity in this situation?” or “How will this event strengthen me?” Let’s pull up the 1st category again here: “Stop focusing on all the ways it won’t work out.” I want to encourage you to instead focus on being positive and taking actions that align with that positive mindframe. Action is the key to realization. If you don’t try to create the life you want, things will most likely not work out in your favor. You must exert effort. You must work for it. You must allow it to happen by making space for the opportunities in life. Yes, there reaches a point where you can’t control the outcome, but reaching that point takes some work. Break down your goals into mini-goals and make a plan of action. Add faith in the fact that it will all work out, and you’ll be a major force to reckon with. That’s all for today, guys. Until later this week, keep the faith! Stay strong, Amy Amy Clover is a writer, coach, teacher and the force behind Strong Inside Out.

Have you ever believed in something so deeply, fought for something so unbelievably risky, that you feel like you may just combust from the effort? Because this dream, this life you see for yourself, this reality you’re already living in your mind, would be such a devastating loss if it fell apart? Many of us get to this point, only to turn back around. The imminent depth of emotion scares us to death, so we retreat to the comfort of certainty. The threat of such a devastating loss breaks us before it ever has a chance to become our experience. We save ourselves from overwhelming pain, but in the process, we deprive ourselves of breathtaking beauty, staggering amounts of joy, and the realization of our full potential. I know what it’s like to tell yourself that the process will be too difficult to complete, that it’s not worth the work it will take, that doing all that it will take will exhaust you beyond repair. I know what it’s like to feel like you might just break. I know that you’re feeling like there’s no way you can sustain this push, that you’ll just fall apart if you don’t choose to stop trying. But you know, as well as I do, that if you stop trying, you’ll look back and feel the same loss (if not worse) knowing that you gave up. The regret you’ll feel will trump this fear, and the knowledge of what could have been will be overwhelming in its own right. When you feel this terror, this panic that drives you to give up, remember why you started at all. You deserve to live an adventure of epic proportions. You deserve to live and breathe to your own grammy-nominated soundtrack. You deserve to experience every iota of your life in hypercolor HD. You are writing your story.
