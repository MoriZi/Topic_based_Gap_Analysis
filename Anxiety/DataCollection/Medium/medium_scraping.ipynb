      "[1, 'https://medium.com/@elissaerin/27-minutes-of-uber-induced-anxiety-efcf6fdf8ba4', '27 Minutes of Uber-Induced Anxiety', '2016-01-01', 'Alternate title: The actual thoughts of a person with Generalized Anxiety Disorder trusting a total stranger to drive her around for almost half an hour. Date: December 27, 2015 Time: 8:39 PM Pickup location: San Francisco International Airport, Departures, Terminal 1, Door 11 Destination: Home, after a 9 day trip to Ohio visiting my family I wait for my Uber driver to arrive. He’s driving a black Prius, just like every other Uber driver tonight. I notice for the first time that the phone app shows the license plate number. That’s handy. I manage to avoid getting into the wrong car. The driver loads my suitcase in the trunk and asks me which route I usually take home. I’ve never been asked this before. I stupidly say, “I don’t know the area very well, just take the GPS directions.” And so my anxiety that this driver is going to abduct me begins. I check my status: 27 minutes until arrival. Why did the driver ask me my route?, I wonder. Is he trying to find out whether or not I know my way around? Now he knows I don’t. He’s going to abduct me. There’s no way he would ask me that unless he wanted to abduct me. I check the driver rating: 4.9 stars. OK, so he probably hasn’t abducted anyone before. But there’s a first time for everything. He could’ve been building up his rating, waiting to abduct an unsuspecting woman at the airport who doesn’t pay enough attention to know which route she usually takes. I take stock of how insane these thoughts are. I keep thinking them anyway. He takes off his hat. Why did he take off his hat? Is it too warm or is he trying to remove anything that could impede his vision when he shoots me with the gun that is most definitely under his seat? He shifts in his seat. Is he reaching for the gun? I use the app to send my husband the trip update so he can avenge me in the likely case of my demise. 22 minutes until arrival. Why does he keep moving around? Geez, there are a lot of cars on the road. Forget the gun, I’ll probably die in a car accident before he has the time to use it. I’ve heard that car accidents are the leading cause of death of people under the age of 35. I didn’t verify the statistics, but that sounds about right. I wonder what the statistics are for people who die via car crash because the driver is distracted trying to retrieve a gun from under his seat? 16 minutes until arrival. We seem to be moving in the direction of home, though that could be a decoy. He shifts in his seat again. Why does he keep shifting? Why hasn’t he talked to me since asking me about the route? I don’t really want to talk, but maybe it’s a bad sign that he hasn’t said anything. Don’t humanize the victim. It would be harder to shoot me if he got to know me. Unless he didn’t like my personality. Maybe getting to know me would make him want to shoot me more. Should I talk to him? No, he would know something was up if I started talking now. The road is less crowded. That probably means I’m less likely to get hit. It also means less potential witnesses for the abduction/shooting. I really should’ve taken an Uber Pool. My impatience is going to get me killed. 13 minutes until arrival. We’re off the highway. The car has a sticker that says “Baby on Board.” I can’t imagine a vicious killer having such a sticker. Then again, I don’t see this so-called baby, so it could just be a ploy to lure victims into his car. I can’t really picture a murderer driving a Prius either, but San Franciscans are notoriously eco-friendly, so it could be the car of choice for sadistic abductors. For Prius’ sake, I hope its popularity among murderers is never discovered by the general public. 6 minutes until arrival. If he’s going to abduct and/or murder me, he’s seriously running out of time. Maybe his plan is to shoot me after I get out of the car and then speed off. Less mess. Or maybe someone on my street will pull a gun when I get there. I had another nightmare about mass shootings last night — that’s the second one this week. I knew halfway through that it was a dream this time, but I couldn’t wake up until I got shot. I tried to run, but I can’t even run in my dreams. I think I’m a worse runner in my dreams, which is quite the feat since the last time I ran a mile was in 5th grade. 10 minutes, 9 seconds. The time it took me to run that mile, not my ETA. 3 minutes until arrival. We’re driving down an empty road. It’s very quiet. I don’t like when it’s this quiet. It’s unnerving — the sound of silence. We’re within a block. I can see my building. “It’s the one up here, the red one.” He unloads my luggage from the trunk. “Happy holidays!” he says as I walk toward my apartment. “You too!” I respond. I put the key in the lock and turn it. I’m in my building, and after one set of stairs, in my apartment. I’m safe. I survived. I open the phone app to rate my ride. 5 stars.']\n",
      "[18, 'https://medium.com/@gmblonder/you-are-not-alone-and-neither-am-i-507e27354f35', 'You are Not Alone (and Neither am\\xa0I)', '2016-01-05', 'This is in response to the too-many people who are wrestling with their own brains, resigned to their solitude. To those who have opened up about their struggles, and to those who lock them so deeply they can barely feel the jagged edges. You are lonely, but you’re not alone. As I’ve gotten older, I’ve noticed it takes me longer to recover from system shocks. An evening of drinking will leave me nastily hungover where I could once pop back with a shower and a stick of gum. An afternoon of crying, similarly, will fill my head with cotton and my eyes with dust for the remainder of the day. It’s probably best for my health that I try to minimize both activities, but the ideal doesn’t necessarily change the reality. Life is hard, anxiety is hard, depression is freaking hard. There are sneaky brain weasels hiding in the creases of your life, waiting to pull that tripwire a little tighter. The sneaky brain weasels are cunning — they know every doubt that flickers through your mind, and they’re armed with butterfly nets and magnifying glasses. Sometimes my mind feels larger than my skull, and I need lie down outside and be absorbed by the grass. Sometimes the world hits me so hard that I feel the edges of myself curling in. Sometimes my bedroom is my only haven, and sometimes it’s my self-guarded prison cell. I relish the quiet hum of loneliness as I stretch my arms to press against the invisible, seemingly-impermeable walls of my bubble. I stare at unsent text messages before deleting them. I stare at unwashed dishes before crawling back into the safety of my blanket nest. Please note that I am fine. Not necessarily always Fine, but fine. I have a great support system and a great therapist. I am extraordinarily lucky for both. Not everyone is as lucky as I am, and not everyone has the ability to talk about it. And that’s why we who can must talk about it as much as\\xa0possible. Talk about mental health, and the struggles we face. Talk about our hopes, our sadness, our desperation. Empty our darkness into the ether until we’re not even sure where ours ends and the worlds’ begins. If we spilled our thoughts the way wrists spill blood, we would all be better off. We, the anxious, the depressed, the flat-out sad, the past-the-breaking-point, the weakest links, the stronger-than-we-know. We are lonely, but we are not alone.']\n"
