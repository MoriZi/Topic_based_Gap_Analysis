"Depression and Money, Some Real Talk","Depression and Money, Some Real Talk This is the first in a series of conversations about depression and money. Logan Sachon: So we’re here today to talk about DEPRESSION and how it affects our MONEY. Martha Kaplan: Not well. It has what I would characterize as a “negative effect.” LS: Yes. I think you are right about that. We both have some personal experience with this. I’d say. MK: I would say that also. LS: So we’re going to talk about this. Martha Kaplan is not your real name, though maybe it should be. MK: Yes I have requested to be anonymous because of my job. It’s hard to be taken seriously in your place of business if it’s widely known that one, you are a lady, and two, you sometimes have trouble getting out of bed. Either of the the two is problematic. But in combination it’s disastrous. LS: … MK: I’ll give you the breakdown on my “issues.” So I’ve probably always been somewhere on the depression spectrum. But this got particularly bad during college. There was a week-long period my sophomore year when I didn’t really leave my room. I mean, I got some food, occasionally, but I mostly didn’t go to class. I definitely didn’t wash my hair. I didn’t really see people (probably part of that was shame because of the state of my unwashed hair). This was maybe right around the period when I started putting vodka into my coffee before going to class. I was, in general, not being the best Me I could be. But anyway, at a certain point I came out of that, and I started seeing a therapist who I didn’t end up liking that much, but I was diagnosed then with a mild bipolar disorder. I eventually went on a couple medications: Lamictal, which was originally for seizures, but has a secondary use as a mood stabilizer for manic depressives who can’t be on antidepressants because that would make their mood too elevated, and also Concerta, which is essentially time release Ritalin, which I basically got because I wanted to stay up all night writing papers, because I always wait until the night before to start doing things. So that was less related to my “illness” or whatever. LS: BUT WAS IT I WONDER? (I do that, too.) (Wait until the last minute.) MK: I mean, my inability to do shit certainly is related to my anxiety re what I’m producing not being good enough. If you self-sabotage, you can blame that for the low quality of the product you make. You set yourself up for failure, so you can avoid larger, failure of SELF. We’ve talked about this. I think we both do it. LS: Yes. You recently re-reminded me that I do it — many a therapist has told me I do this! And my mother! But I forget. MK: Self-sabotage. It’s very trendy and helpful. Anyway, I spent a lot of time not being in therapy or on medication; but I’ve been seeing someone for about seven months now, and it’s been a pretty big game changer. Her diagnosis right now is generalized anxiety disorder, though I think I cycle through high and low moods with some intensity and frequency, which is a mark of bipolar disorder (like, also of life, and having feelings). But it’s probably not serious enough to be diagnosed. Bipolar disorder is SERIOUS. Anyway. I’m managing my shit with talk therapy. And no medication at the moment. And it’s going okay. Probably my best friend, to whom I often write panicked emails and or have very teary conversations with, would disagree to a certain extent. So that is my deal. What is YOUR DEAL, Logan? LS: Like you, my first experience with pretty intense therapy and an actual diagnosis and medication came in college. I saw two therapists in high school, but only for a few sessions each, and both times it was understood, at least by me, that I was just seeing this third-party adult to talk through some hard times. But my third year of college, everything was going great on paper but I was anxious and miserable all the time and also could not get out of bed. I eventually dragged myself to student health — it’s funny, that seems like such an easy thing to do, but I remember it being this huge internal debate, mostly because I felt like if I just tried harder I could figure this out. But something eventually made me go, and I went. Pretty quickly I had a talk therapist and a psychiatrist and a prescription for Prozac. I say sometimes that the Prozac saved my life, which is an exaggeration in that I wasn’t suicidal, but the difference between before I was taking it and after was incredible, for me. My diagnosis at that time was mild obsessive compulsive disorder, but all the docs I’ve seen since then — and it’s been several — have said it’s really more just clinical depression. I’ve taken myself on and off medication and in and out of talk therapy a lot in the past eight years. Sometimes because I felt like I was CURED, sometimes because of the expense, sometimes because my prescription ran out and I didn’t refill it, sometimes because I read an article or got deep into an internet hole about how anti-depressants are a government conspiracy to poison our brains and turn us into zombies, and sometimes because I moved and couldn’t deal with finding a new doctor. MK: Feeling like you’re cured is a problem. I feel — and this is a dumb comparison — that it’s a little like being on a diet. Like, you lose 20 pounds, or feel mentally stable and you’re like OKAY DONE SOLVED IT. And then you stop eating just pressed fruit or taking your medication or going to therapy and your body is like, guess we’re off the hook and just goes back to doing what it does best, which is hating itself. That is obviously a glib comparison, but it has taken me a long time to accept that I’m never going to be done dealing with this. I have to live my life in a different way forever to be healthy/happy/not sobbing uncontrollably and never leaving my bed. LS: Right. I went on and off medication several times and then three years ago I was like, okay, I’m going to give this one more try. I’m going to go off it and do it right, and see what happens. And so I weaned myself off with the help of a doctor. and I was off the meds for a year, and during that time I worked out several times a week, I swam laps, I ate good food. I saw an acupuncturist once or twice a week, I made sure I got enough sleep. I did all the things that you’re supposed to do. And I thought I was doing so well, I thought I’d figured it out. And then I went home to visit my family, and I can still remember my mom saying, “Yeah, you can get out of bed, but you are not you. You are not thriving.” And it was then that I realized that my life was PERFECT, basically, at that time I had a good job and great friends and great house, and I should have been feeling so much better than “getting by.” So I saw a new doctor and went back on meds and I haven’t tried to go off of them again. But here’s the other fun thing. MK: Tell me the fun thing. LS: Is that even though I’ve accepted and decided and even embraced that I need medicine to just be at a normal functioning level, THAT’S NOT ENOUGH. Because three times since then I’ve had to change medications because what I was on stopped working. “How does that work?” UNCLEAR. Psychiatrists don’t even really know how antidepressants work, and they don’t know how they don’t work. So those periods of trying new meds are always really, really terrible. MK: I guess this is a good time for me to say that I am not super pro-medication, at least not for myself. There were a series of terrifying articles in the NYRB about how doctors literally have no idea how antipsychotics or antidepressants or any of that shit works, and how they change your brain, and how it’s impossible to ever go off them because of that. And that scares me. (I’ve also never had very good experiences with medications. The Lamictal made me feel like my head was filled with cotton balls. I felt functional but very, very dull.) Though obviously everyone has to do what works for them, and as your friend, who cares about your mental health, I’m really glad you have found medication that works for you. You are typing right now, but I also want to remember to go back to that thing that you said about just getting by, just functioning because I think that’s really important AND has to do with how this kind of shit affects the way that we spend our money. LS: The “yes meds or no meds conversations” isn’t a conversation I’m interested in having any longer. I’ve accepted that they work for me and I don’t care to explore that further. I’m not going to try to convince you to go on them. Okay that’s not entirely true. I have tried to convince you to go on them. So basically we are two women. Two women who sometimes suffer from depression (I hate that phrase. Have depression? Can be depressed? Have a diagnosed disease called depression?) We are just trying to figure out the best ways to get through our days. MK: Trying not to self-sabotage ourselves into an early grave, or bankruptcy. LS: So to start out, with the money talk. Just going to doctors and therapists is expensive. MK: Oh YES IT IS. When I was in college, my mother paid for not only my therapist BUT ALSO a psychiatrist I saw every couple of months, for the medication, because my psychologist was not a doctor/could not prescribe meds. And I … did not feel as guilty as I should have about this. I think insurance covered some part of it, but not all of it. But now I am a grown ass woman, with a job and stuff. And so when I decided I needed to see a therapist again (“decided” = more like everyone I knew was like GET HELP WE CANNOT DEAL WITH THIS YOU ARE SO UNHAPPY) (and I was like a MACHINE OF SELF PITY) (and then finally I was like, “Hey guys, you’re right”), I was determined to pay for it myself, which, ugh, was/is hard. The first person I went to, who I FELL IN LOVE WITH, was this tiny old woman on the Upper West Side (obviously). We had three consultation sessions, which thankfully I did not have to pay for, because this lady was $300 per session. WHICH IS BONKERS. That was like my entire income, basically. LS: Did you know that before or after you went to see her? MK: I found out during session two, which was crushing. But she was very nice and recommended someone. BUT this woman was also very expensive, because I lied about how much I could afford, because I am awkward talking about money. So for two months, I went to the woman I now see. And she was charging me her full rate, and that was … $200 a session. And that was very hard. I essentially took a second job to cover it. And my mom ended up paying $200 total over that two month period. But finally my therapist, who is not a dumb lady, was like, “So, um, how are you paying for this? How much money do you actually make?” And I was like, “I actually cannot afford this AT ALL thank you for asking.” And she cut her fee in half, which was amazing. And THEN I went through this really rough period. I didn’t go to work for a day, because of the SADNESS. And she was like, “This happens a lot, when you start delving into stuff. It sometimes gets worse. If you want to get through this faster, maybe two sessions a week?” And I was like, “I cannot pay for that.” And she, being an amazing human, was like, “What if the rate was the same? Per week?” So I’m now paying $50 a session, still kind of working a second job, but making it work and not relying on my mother for dollars, which I think is good for me. I think if she was paying for it (which she would totally do), I wouldn’t take it as seriously. I blew off appointments a lot when I was in school, because, like, whatever, not my money (also because I was sad and she was not a great therapist). LS: I’m not seeing someone right now, but have an appointment next week to see someone, a consultation appointment. We haven’t talked money yet, but I know the friend who referred me pays a discounted rate, though that might not mean anything. You can only afford for so many people to not pay you your rate, right? So his sliding scale spots might be filled. So I’m preparing myself for that. But, like you and your UWS lady, you just need somewhere to start. If I can’t afford him, I’ll get names from him. I also cannot really afford to be going to therapy, but … I also cannot really afford NOT to go to therapy. My parents have said they’ll help me, and they’ve helped me in the past, but like you, it’s not something I want to get into. Even though I’ve been to five zillion therapists, finding a new one and starting with a new one is always a big step, a positive step. This annual or biannual or whatever it is acceptance that this is not just a funk I’m in and I can’t just pull myself up and snap out of it. So making this appointment was big, and it’s something I want to do on my own. MK: I think this is a totally acceptable thing for your parents to help you with if that’s possible for them. Like, it’s possible for me to make this work financially without help. But if you can’t make it work financially without help, I don’t think that’s a reason not to do it. Because so many other things, including your financial situation, will improve if you get help on this thing. And you are 28, so you will probs not be a dick like I was in college and not take it seriously. I think this is a good transition to: how does being depressed/anxious make you spend more money? Because I really, really think it does and not just on meds/doctors/etc. at least for me. I am, right now, wearing a “panic sweater,” a sweater I bought while having a small panic attack. (I also bought a cardigan.) (They’re both great.) (But I DID NOT need them / could not really afford them.) But the brain situation was so crazy for me at that moment that I HAD TO PURCHASE SOMETHING to take my mind off it. LS: It really is a beautiful sweater. I’ve been admiring it all day. MK: Why thank you. Being panicked apparently makes me a discerning shopper. Who knew. That must be why shopping at large malls during the holiday season is so productive. (JOKES) LS: Yeah I am wearing sad jeans, bought when I was sad. They aren’t that great. I am a bad sad shopper. Which is also one of the reasons I don’t have any cool stuff to show for all my credit card debt. It’s more like, this is a shirt, that’ll work, cha-ching, ten minutes of … not misery. MK: I’ve made bad sad shopping decisions. Once I flew into a panic because I was going on a date and was too sweaty. So I bought an entirely new outfit, which included a tiny short-sleeved sweater, which I never wear because it is SUPER hideous. I think part of the problem is when you’re depressed or anxious, you don’t feel like it will ever be better. You believe you will exist in that state forever, and if there’s anything that you can think of that will make you feel better, you just fucking do it. Including buying tiny sweaters and sad pants and pounds of macaroni and cheese. LS: Yes. It’s very much about what will help me NOW. For me, depression has a lot to do with stasis. I stayed in bed most of today. Reading. Watching TV shows. Napping. And I knew, theoretically, that if I got out of bed and took a shower I would feel SO MUCH Better, but there was also this part of me that was like, but what if I don’t? I’m miserable now, but at least I’m comfortable and miserable. And if I’m out in the world, it’s like, well I’m miserable, but if I buy something, at least i’ll have a cute outfit and be miserable. Or an ice cream cone and be miserable. I don’t ever think about future me. I’m really mean to future me. Only nice to this moment me. MK: Being depressed is a lot about just surviving. It promotes a subsistence lifestyle. You were talking earlier about going home and your mom noticing that you were just “getting by,” but not doing well. I think if you’re depressed or anxious and you’re not treating it, you just do a bunch of shit in order to just get by. And the fear is, if you don’t there will be no future you. Not that I’m saying you would have killed yourself if you hadn’t bought those sad pants or I would have killed myself if I hadn’t bought that tiny sweater. But it’s true that my feelings felt unsustainable, and feelings are facts. (I stole that from a friend, but it is The Truth.) LS: Oh that’s good. That’s really good. MK: It’s hard to argue with them. They’re worse than facts, because they don’t respond to logic. They only respond to impulsive purchases, and massive amounts of cheese, or whatever it is that you’re doing in order not to rip your own face off. If you’re facing a choice between harming yourself financially and harming yourself physically, it seems pretty clear to me that price of a tiny sweater is not such a high one to pay. LS: ON THAT NOTE. This has not been a terribly uplifting little chat we’ve had. MK: No it has not been. I think we need to do more. But I have a birthday dinner to go to now. LS: Oh, we’ll do more. So much to cover, so much to share. But for now, you’re going to leave, and I’m going to go back to bed. MK: Do what you got to do. Seriously. The other options are kind of terrible, and it’s helpful sometimes to remember that you could be a lot worse to yourself, to future you AND present you, than going to bed. Or buying some jeans.

What Being Alone and Scared in a Paris Airport Taught Me About Solo Travel,"What Being Alone and Scared in a Paris Airport Taught Me About Solo Travel I was 21 years old and had just left North America for the first time to embark on the solo travel adventure I had been dreaming of for months. Jet-lagged and nervous, I arrived at Charles de Gaulle airport in Paris expecting my French host to pick me up. When she didn’t show up, what happened next was one of the most important lessons I learned about solo travel.  I had dreamed of visiting Europe, and especially Paris, for a long time. I had studied Art History at University and I dreamed of seeing the artwork and architecture that I had only seen in textbooks and slides. My obsession with Paris was made even stronger when Sophie, the French girl on an internship at the local University, moved in next door to me in Canada and became my friend. When she went back to Paris, I realized that I had a friend to visit in the City of Light and this made the idea of travelling there much less intimidating. None of my friends or my family wanted to go with me on my journey, but I didn’t want this to stop me from making my dream happen. I realized that if I wanted to make it to Europe I would have to do it on my own. I worked two jobs all summer long and saved every dollar I could, planning my trip with eager anticipation. I couldn’t sleep at all the night before the flight, and I was twitching with excitement on the plane. My stomach felt like I was clattering up the steep incline before the drop on a huge roller coaster; I was a bit excited but mostly terrified because I had never travelled on my own before. I was so nervous about arriving in Paris but I had arranged everything that would happen when I got off the plane at Charles de Gaulle Airport. Sophie would pick me up and take me to her apartment and everything would be fine from there. However, that is not what happened. I arrived at CDG after a 15 hour plane ride, jet lagged and bewildered. Having never left North America before, I felt like I was on a different planet. I struggled to read the French signs and finally found my way to the main lobby of the airport where I began to pace up and down nervously and waited for Sophie to arrive. Ten minutes passed by, and she was not there. I shrugged it off as normal, since my friend was never known for her punctuality. I sat down on the steps and waited some more. Twenty minutes ticked by on the dusty clock on the drab airport lounge wall. Where the hell was Sophie? The nervousness in my stomach was starting to grow into fear. I started to look around for her; perhaps she was waiting at a different door? Thirty minutes went by. I wandered outside to look for her. Three tough looking men in dark jackets were smoking cigarettes outside of the door. They looked at me curiously as I frantically scanned the parking lot for any sign of her. “Uh… Je cherche mon amie?” (I’m looking for my friend) I explained in my very mediocre French. They laughed and leered at me, saying “Je vais être votre ami, jolie fille” (I’ll be your friend, pretty girl.) Yikes! I rushed back inside. I realized that I had made a serious first-time solo traveller mistake: I did not have a back-up plan. I didn’t have the telephone number of a taxi cab company, the name of a hostel to stay at, or even any knowledge of the train system. I didn’t even have Sophie’s phone number written down, so I couldn’t check to see why she hadn’t shown up. I had relied on my friend too much and I had failed to figure out for myself how to get into Paris. I sat down on the steps with my head in my hands. An hour had gone by, and I was still alone. I wanted to cry. I was tired, jet lagged, confused and the furthest away from home I had ever been in my life. There was a moment when I wanted to jump back on the first plane to Canada and go home. Then a sudden realization hit me. I said to myself; “No you idiot. You did not spend your entire summer bagging groceries every weekend just so that you could fly to Paris, chicken out and turn around and go home. If Sophie is not going to show up, then you are fully capable of figuring out how to get to Paris on your own.” That was the moment when I took control of my own travel experience. I realized that if I dreamt of exploring the world, I needed to have the confidence to figure things out on my own even if I was in over my head. I couldn’t just rely on others, I needed to make my own plans and so that I could truly be independent. An amazing thing happened when I had that epiphany. All of the nervousness I had inside melted away. I was no longer afraid. I had taken control of my experience into my own hands, so I had nothing to worry about. I had the power to make my trip around Europe happen. Once I had this confidence, all my fears about travelling alone dissolved. I got up off the dusty steps, took a deep breath and started to head towards the payphones. If Sophie was MIA, I needed to find a place to stay. It was at that exact moment when my French friend came running towards me across the airport lounge. She apologized profusely for being over an hour late, but in the end I was not mad at her. That hour spent scared out of my mind in Charles de Gaulle Airport was one of the most important hours of my life, as it is when I learned a very valuable lesson about solo travel. With my newfound confidence I decided I wanted to explore beyond Paris and see more of Europe during my visit. I planned my own route through The Netherlands and Germany, taking buses and trains and staying in my very first hostel! The more you travel on your own, the more you will build your confidence. You will feel nervous the first time, and that is only natural. But once you set foot on foreign soil for the first time, find your way from the airport to the city, find your hotel, and start exploring your destination, you will be filled with the most amazing sense of pride. You’ve made it here, to the other side of the world, all on your own. If you can do that, you can do just about anything! Originally published at global-goose.com on January 3, 2013.",2013
Being Ok with Not Being Ok: The Process I Use to (Try to) Accept Any State,"Being Ok with Not Being Ok: The Process I Use to (Try to) Accept Any State 1. Recognize it 2. Breathe into it 3. It is what it is 4. Take action to do what you can 5. Beyond breathing it out Originally published at stronginsideout.com on February 18, 2013. You have to be ok with not being ok. As much as I say that, putting it into practice is a whole other ball game. Recently, I’ve been trying to get all my locations set and I’ve been making some headway thanks to some amazingly supportive people all over North America (more on that on Friday :)). I have a lot of people I’m still waiting to hear back from… And I’ve realized that I just have to be ok with not knowing. …yes, I have to be, but I don’t know yet how to be. I’m hoping the process is somewhat similar to becoming ok with not being ok in the depression realm of my life. When those sinking feelings come around now, I’m very much like Chris Brogan in that I alert those close to me, and focus on accepting that that’s just where I am at the moment. Then, I get outside and do stuff which almost always makes me feel a little better. But this: this overwhelming uncertainty of not knowing what’s coming next. This swelling panic of forging new paths through the thick jungles of untraveled territory… I’m having a tough time with it. So I’m going to talk myself through this right here with you all in hopes that it will help some of you who are just starting to adopt this acceptance as well. I’ll keep it open-ended so that it will work for all situations. Even if you don’t struggle with any diagnoses, this exercise can help you through those tough moments of uncertainty that threaten to beat us all down. These are the steps toward acceptance that I’ve used with depression and anxiety, that I am hoping will also help me cope with this fear of uncertainty: Whatever class of ovewhelm you’re experiencing, whether it be depression, anxiety, uncertainty or anything else, you must recognize it in order to move out of it. It seems almost easier to push it away, to deny it. Call it something else like a bad day, or a few nights without enough sleep. Justify it away for too long and you’re lost in the land of denial without bread crumbs to find your way back. It’s possible to deny away your situation so that you end up so far away from it that you don’t remember what you were denying in the first place, making the solution even more ethereal. When you start to experience unease, get into the habit of looking within. What are you feeling and why? Recognize it for what it is and have the courage to say, “I am hurting/worried/terrified/panicking/dreading/etc.” Recognizing and admitting to your feelings won’t give them power. In fact, it’s the opposite. It’s like taking out the flashlight when you’re afraid of the dark. If you see the shadows for what they are in the light, they’re not so scary any more. Take a few moments to just be with your feelings. Doing this will likely bring you up against some major internal resistance. Your body will fight it. Your mind will try to focus on something else or block it entirely. Just breathe into it. Breathe into these feelings and let them be what they are for a moment, however overwhelming they may be. Repeat: “This is just how it is right now, and that’s ok.” Without placing judgment on your situation or feelings, simply accept that this is what you’re experiencing. Keep those deep breaths going, and find that core place within you to ground yourself in. You’re still here. You’re still strong. These emotions won’t wash you away. Stick with it. Repeat this however many times you need to until your breathing calms and you have the ability to see your emotions from the outside, knowing that they are just what they are at the moment. By accepting these feelings, you climb above them to gain a bird’s eye view. From here, you will likely find that this state is transitory. This will pass, and you’ll make it through stronger for holding on. After you’ve grounded yourself through breathing, you will likely be more able and willing to take action to overcome it. Go back to the first step and ask yourself again: What am I feeling right now and why? Take that “why” and let it inform your next actions… If you are feeling depressed or anxious, there may not be a distinct answer. That’s ok. There is a solution: get outside. Go do something that takes you away from this place you’re in right now. Go to a funny movie. Read a book at a park. Go to the gym. Meet a friend at a coffee shop. Though moving may be the last thing you want to do right now, it is probably the best thing you could possibly do for your psyche. If your “why” is a definite cause to your fear or anxiety, and you are truly doing everything you can to move forward on it, you just have to accept that this is how it has to be right now. This is where we become ok with not being ok. That knowledge that you have taken action and you cannot control the result, can free you if you allow it to. If you’re still having a hard time, try getting outside, like I recommended to those struggling with unprovoked emotions. Remember, there is always someone here for you if you feel like it’s just past the point of breathing through it. Don’t be afraid to reach out for help. Call that person who’s always there for you, or contact a counselor in your area. If it’s an emergency, call these people (who were paramount in my worst times). Personally, I’m making time to go see my Dr. Pam this week. She’s my therapist and savior, and I almost always feel lighter coming out of there than I did walking in. The important thing to remember is this: no matter how deep the feeling goes, or how heavy it may seem, you will make it through this. Just keep breathing.

Being Judged in Diversity Work,"Being Judged in Diversity Work Related Anxiety is a familiar feeling people experience when preparing to receive results or feedback from a report, test, or other kind of individual evaluation. There are so many situations where we are encumbered with worry and dread related to work performance reviews, college exam scores, car diagnostic tests, and an assortment of preventive exams and medical tests from pre- and post-natal through to childhood and the venerable golden years. We did not come into this world with this anxiety. I recall sitting with my first born in the doctor’s office as they prepared me to help administer the first of several immunizations. My daughter laid in my lap, nearly bald and toothless, having no idea what was about to come her way. She eagerly awaited the start of the doctor’s visit. In contrast, I was personally very anxious because it was my first time and I dreaded the immunization shots as an overly protective first-time father. Earlier while waiting in the exam room, I overheard twins in the room adjacent screaming bloody murder as nurses scurried from the same room vanishing out of sight around a corner. Moments later, the pediatrician shot out of the same room with the screaming twins yelling this curdling deep shriek from within. The doctor cried, “Can someone help me in here?” As the door closed behind the nurses re-entering the room, I saw what I presumed to be the mother trying to manhandle her two toddlers as they whooped and hollered, arms flailing about with bright, beet-red faces. Thankfully, my ordeal was nothing like the twins’ experience as my daughter smiled like the Mona Lisa until the nurse poked her in the arm three different times. Each time, my daughter looked into my soul as if to say, “How could you do this to me? I thought we were friends, man.” Years later en route to another doctor’s visit, I would talk to my pre-schooler daughter to help reassure her if only for a moment until she asked more questions or nervously fidgeted in her car seat. At the doctor’s office, our new pediatrician would distract her, allow me to hold her closely, speaking kindly and gently to her as each needle poked her little arms. Her face would be so sad, tears coming down her cheeks, and little arms holding her papi’s neck, aggressively. A whole field of study focuses on test anxiety because of how it hinders an individual’s ability to do well. Test anxiety is when an individual experiences extreme stress and has feelings of dread and worry, negative thinking, physiological tension, and discomfort during testing situations. Another aspect includes test result anxiety. The New York Times did a story focusing on the anxiety people experience waiting for medical results. Test Result Anxiety in Diversity Work In cultural competency work, a valid and reliable assessment is the cornerstone to build confidence in the results and develop strategic priorities. However, there is plenty of anxiety and other feelings to go around. In particular, when conducting a feedback session, I have found there can be an assortment of real life concerns. One of the most common feelings is fear of judgment. In a competitive society, being negatively judged by others where someone is perceived as not up to par or is not exceptional in some fashion can be difficult because it can expose a person’s vulnerability. Perceived failure on an assessment, even if it cannot be failed and there are no right or wrong answers, can still be disappointing for many, however, irrational it seems. Who wants to walk away feeling they are a racist or sexist? In many societies and communities, racism, sexism, and other forms of bias go against the social code of egalitarian values. Most do not pride themselves as bigots. So, any hint that it might be true is quite a big blow to their ego. Although professionals do not use a cultural competency assessment to determine whether a person is a bigot, the negative judgment is a latent but apparent fear people consider when contemplating their results. Unlike infants and toddlers, who seem fearless in the face of the unknown, adults develop a sophisticated network of fears about all kinds of real and imagined experiences. For some, the reality is that feedback from a cultural competency assessment can be a bit intimating tapping into feelings of guilt, shame, fear, and an array of uncomfortable, much better if avoided, emotions. There are those who feel more confident in their cultural competency because they value fairness and equality. They have high expectations of themselves, as well, because of their extensive multicultural experience. Anything indicating they are not as advanced, as they believed, can be a shock to the system. Although they, oftentimes, present themselves as cool, calm, and collected, I learned that self-doubt can lead to feelings of embarrassment and ambiguity that pick at them. For people with extensive multicultural experience, they are not always prepared to know what to do with the fact they are not as prepared to manage intercultural situations as effectively as they aspired to be. They may have learned to put on a good face during difficult exchanges, which led to them being less culturally savvy hampered by challenges from a collection of problematic encounters. After receiving their personalized cultural competency profile, it may stir up emotions ranging from open optimism to a touch of anger and maybe indignation. Commonly, many experience ambivalence needing time to allow the information to percolate in their minds as they attempt to make the information personally resonate for them. For another group, they feel an immediate sense of clarity and excitement to start the work. Regardless, each can find a way to receive the feedback constructively in their time. Still, others will question the reliability and validity of the results attempting to point to poorly worded, vague, or confusing items. Whether they believed it prior to assessment or not, questions of the assessment may transition to devaluing diversity and inclusion. As a result, they dismiss their results and feel resolute to treat everyone the same from a humanist ideal. Where Do We Go From Here? It is important to recognize any and all of these aforementioned responses are real, requiring attention and careful consideration. It can ruin a feedback session if I respond with a dismissive attitude toward a client’s experience. As a consultant and coach, I provide results and information, which I must feel confident, reflects the best indication of where a person’s strengths are toward creating a plan to develop their cultural competency moving forward. For my clients, I know they are not children to be coddled. However, reassurance can go a long way with many people as we discuss in depth what the results mean and how people commonly overestimate their cultural competency. I have also reviewed with clients their areas of strength and growth, setting goals for how they achieve greater cultural competency, and review their action plan. The intention here is to make the experience in a feedback session as realistic as possible, setting up a picture that takes out some of the mystery that will allow more focus on achieving the goals set forth. It is important to set realistic expectations and bring the experience back down to Earth. By recognizing and appreciating the fears, doubts, and anxiety that commonly emerge, people can manage feedback sessions well, allowing them to prepare themselves and avoiding the feeling of being overexposed and needlessly vulnerable. In spite of these feelings, I find that people are willing to take measured risks, conjuring whatever courage or blind trust they need to be present, if needed, and move forward at the appropriate time. They may continue to experience anxiety, fear, doubt, ambivalence, and disappointment. These feelings are also pared down enough to permit them to tap into their innate reservoirs of courage. As Ambrose Redmoon once wrote: “Courage is not the absence of fear, but rather the judgment that something else is more important than fear.” Originally published at jelaniaustin.com on February 17, 2013.",2013
DENVER bound!! #RoadTrip2013,"DENVER bound!! #RoadTrip2013 In my mind I was going to play hockey for the Avalanche and then in the summer play for the Chicago White Sox (sorry, Twins, but Robin Ventura was my favorite). These dreams did not come true, but I will be living at least 1% of my dream by being able to visit the lovely city of Denver. I will be traveling (by car) with my wife and my parents. As you have probably been able to piece together by now, my anxiety heavily affects my travel habits. I have a fear of flying. My fear is mainly rooted in control and insecurities about death… but those issues are either for a separate article or personal conversation. I’m an open book and if you want to know, just ask. I think that talking about issues can shed a great light and help both parties. So back to the Denver, and more specifically, the baseball part of this post. I have always had this stadium/city high on my priority list, but since it is further away than say, Kansas City, Milwaukee, Chicago, etc., it was not my first to be crossed off the list. When my dad mentioned that he’d like to show me the mountains a few weeks ago, I jumped on it and came up with the tentative plans of a road trip to Denver over the 4th of July. The 4th provided the time period for maximized days off from work without taking vacation days for me and my wife. Plus, when I researched it, I found out that the Rockies played their last game of a home stand on the 4th and would be having fireworks after the game. As I enjoy taking photos, this added experience will provide an additional chance to get awesome game and mountain pictures. So, what can you expect, dear reader? Well, hopefully some “grade A” photos, a ball or two from the game (commemorative for the 20th season?), and a HUGE post — similar to the Kansas City trip last year. What would I appreciate from you? If you know of any way to get 4 tickets on the 1st base side (preferably close to the field), I would GREATLY appreciate it. The 1st base side seems to offer the best angle for mountain pix, and since my parents are going with, I want to give them nice seats. Plus, Cuddy plays right field, and I enjoyed him as a Twin, so I’d like to support him and shout “hello.” Well, that’s it for now. I am already incredibly pumped for this adventure. A new stadium AND REAL mountains!! (Thank you to my dad for mentioning that he wants to show me mountains. It’s cool to know that he remembers those dreams I had as a kid.)",2013
Change is Rapid but Recovery Gradual,"Change is Rapid but Recovery Gradual It isn’t that weddings are not in themselves joyful. The problem is these major occurrences in life bring about change and change brings alterations to our daily lives. We get comfortable with the way things are and any transformations, good or bad, leave us floundering. We can’t see into the future and we fear the unknown. We think, it might be worse instead of, it might be better. We are kicked out of our comfort zone so we panic and become full of anxiety. Weddings bring forth cheerful gatherings, friendly people good food and new beginnings. They have the added hope of new life and grandchildren. There doesn’t seem to be room for any misgivings. There is adjustment. Our child is officially an adult, on their own, influenced by another person not of our picking. We fear losing influence, time, and connectedness with them. We also fear our need to move on in a different direction because we no longer need to spend time nurturing our children, we have more time. The newlyweds fear their decision to have chosen this individual to spend the rest of their lives with. They have doubts and questions. They fear being thrown into the adult role and taking responsibility for themselves, and their mistakes. It was easier allowing their parents to guide them, make the decisions and take the blame for anything going off track. They are anxious about paying bills, living with another individual and being accountable for their own lives. Reality is setting in and it is not a totally comfortable event. Having a baby is another wonderful happening. It would appear to bring out only happy times. This is not so. Now we need to put another person before ourselves. We need to worry more about saving and paying bills. We must be more responsible in our behaviors because we are now influencing another human being. Our driving might improve and our driving speed may be slower. Our binge drinking has to end and thoughts about smoking and foul language take on their own importance. We begin to doubt our capability to accomplish this task. Both of these wonderful happenings are evolving into nightmares because we are scared of the future and its changes. We liked doing what we wanted when we wanted and where we wanted. Doubts keep surfacing and we try to keep them to ourselves as if we are the only ones on the planet who are or ever did think this way. We are alone in our thoughts and afraid to share them because this is a favorable change. New jobs, homes, friends and neighbors bring their own array of anxieties. They involve our breaking out of our mold and melting into something new. We are challenged to be unveiled and vulnerable. These things may be delightful but they leave us frightened about measuring up to the challenges we are facing. We fear that others can observe our faults, and failings. If we look at the negative changes that happen to us they basically fill us with the same challenges and fears of transformation. A death in the family diminishes us. Our world is forever changed and we are forced to move in another direction. It is difficult to see beyond our own room. The person we loved is not walking among the living. We can’t imagine not talking to them or seeing them. Our world is disintegrating. Coping is difficult. We almost resent hearing the laughter of others we meet. How, we wonder, can the sun rise and the cars busily take people to work? People walk swiftly to and from their respective destinations and we want to shout, “Can’t you understand I’ve lost the love of someone close to me?” No one hears us in the silence and we go through the motions of another day wondering if the agony will ever go away. In a similar way divorce is also devastating. Although it might be something we wanted, it is still an adjustment and an alteration in our lives. It is the death of a relationship and a love we had and believed in. It is in a sense similar to a death because it is the death of a love. It carries all of the pain yet garners little support from others who view this as a choice. Job loss is a total displacement. Self-esteem is lost and how we define ourselves is over. Even a retirement can feel similar to a job loss. We are reinventing ourselves and fighting to claim a new position. In all of these situations good and bad there are adjustments and modifications required. We have to amend our lives and or lifestyles. It is necessary to let go of what was and embrace the unknown. Things are different and variation is required. Conversion to new loves, friends, family, jobs and interests becomes paramount. Replacing our old ways or habits may be difficult but necessary. We are constantly developing. Each evolvement brings us closer to becoming a whole person. Unwrapping the layers of our lives, brings us to greater enlightenment. Perceiving the whole picture leads us to a grander understanding of our life’s purpose. “Progress involves risks. You can’t steal second base and keep your foot on first.” Frederick B. Wilcox",2013
"April 13, 2013 — Leggy","April 13, 2013 — Leggy College did not turn out at all like I imagined it would. All the images I had about partying and making tons of friends really didn’t go with my decision to do 2 majors and 2 minors; I have terrible anxiety issues so the making friends part was really just a pipe dream, I get anxious around people so…clubbing is really just mostly a terrible excruciating event for me. So college was…well…mostly being broke, and eating ramen and reading tons of novels and boys. Oh, the boys. I really should check my email but I never check emails because it gives me huge anxiety and I get panic attacks just thinking about it. Saturdays are overrated when you’re in college. You don’t really have much of a weekend. I have 5 papers and a midterm to churn out and email to my professor before the end of the weekend. I stick my earphones in my ears and Ingrid Michaelson’s “sort of” fill them as I try to churn out another paper. 3 more weeks y’all, 3 more weeks. _________________________________________________________________________ Leggy is just a very Igbo feminist who is trying not to be broke all the time; she will usually be caught reading novels and listening to music.

How I Cured My Anxiety,"How I Cured My Anxiety My first panic attack. Then one day, I discovered the cure for my anxiety. “Adults are just obsolete children.” — Dr. Seuss Giving myself permission to PLAY was the cure for my anxiety. What would the world do without me and my important work?! Play is what we all LOVE to do. And most importantly, play utterly destroys anxiety. Play is a state of mind — it is a way to approach the world. Whether your world is a frightening prison or a loving playground is up to you. Do you have trouble breathing, relaxing, and sleeping? Are you consuming stimulants multiple times per day to hide your exhaustion? Are you sitting still and staring at screens for most of your waking hours? Are you trapped in your own personal hell, and don’t know how to get out? I’ve been there, and I know what it’s like. I hope this post helps you eliminate your anxiety, once and for all. It’s not as hard as you think. I’d convinced myself that something horribly wrong was about to happen. I thought I would be stabbed, shot, or arrested every time I left my apartment. I was sure that there was an impending disaster that would melt the social contract and pit my neighbors against me. I saw criminals and undercover cops everywhere I went. All that “world is coming to an end” talk — I bought into it. I dreaded being around more than one person at a time. I eyed everyone like they were judging me, pitying me, or attempting to manipulate me. My attention was divided in every interaction: one half of me would pretend to be normal, while the other half would be trying to keep it together. I could feel various parts of my face twitching, like I was about to crack. My hands shook constantly. It got so bad that when a friend came to visit me, I couldn’t drink a glass of water because it kept spilling just from me holding it. I tried to behave like nothing was wrong, when all I wanted to do was lock myself in a room and curl up in a ball. If someone had tapped me in the chest, my body would have shattered. If someone had ordered me to cry, my face would have flooded. I felt fragile, weak, and hollow. I didn’t want drugs, but I was ready to take them. When I looked up the side effects, I felt like giving up. Anxiety… Insomnia… Seizures… Psychosis… I didn’t want to be around anyone — not because I stopped liking people, but because I didn’t want them to catch my weird energy. I wearily watched my girlfriend cry when I confided that I felt dead inside, all the time, and I didn’t know how to fix it. I laid on the ground for 20 minutes one night, wondering whether I should call an ambulance. My heart was beating so hard and fast that I could actually hear it, and my left hand was going numb. My anxiety lasted for more than a year. It affected how I breathed, how I thought, how I ate, how I slept, and how I talked. I was serious and tired and afraid, all the time. I wanted so badly to return to my normal, lively, care-free, confident self. But I didn’t know how to shake it. I tried everything to fix myself: I even took a six-week online course, made specifically for men who wanted to overcome anxiety. A few of these things helped, a lot of them didn’t. Some of them made things worse. When my mind processed it and recognized it was the solution, I started laughing. The answer had been so obvious all along. In less than one month, I was back to my old self. The cure for my anxiety was free, fun, painless, and immediately effective. I have no fear that those feelings will ever return. If they do, I’ll be able to wipe them out right away. Have you ever witnessed a little kid working out on a treadmill? Or meeting up with a friend to chat over coffee? Or wearing a suit and making cold-calls? Or attending a networking conference to hand out their business cards? HELL NO. That stuff is lame and boring. If you saw a kid doing any of those things, you would laugh and wonder what the hell was wrong with them. Kids don’t run to get in shape; they run to feel the grass beneath their feet and the wind on their face. Kids don’t have a chat over coffee; they pretend and make jokes and explore the outdoors. Kids don’t go to work; they play their favorite games. Kids don’t network; they bond with other fun kids while playing. There is no ego. There is no guilt. There is no past to regret, and no future to worry about. They just play. And that’s what I’d forgotten, what I’d been missing, all along. It was a subtle but powerful shift in how I viewed the world. For two years, I had unknowingly prevented myself from playing. I am a workaholic, which can be pretty horrible when you work alone. No one tells you to stop or take a break, or that you’re burning yourself out. I’d find myself tethered to the internet all day, sitting in a chair for 10 hours and staring at a bright screen. Even when I was “finished,” I’d impulsively check email several times between midnight and 2 a.m. I know it’s dumb and unnecessary and “What could be so important?” and “You need your sleep,” but I did it anyways. I was oblivious to the fact that my nerves were being frayed for hours on end, and that I desperately needed fun face-to-face time with real human beings. What made matters worse were the idiotic rituals I’d fallen into… Drinking coffee all day, then drinking alcohol with friends on the weekend. I didn’t get outside, I didn’t move enough, I didn’t sleep enough. My weeks were a cycle of over-stimulation and numbing. Even when I was “playing” (doing fun activities with friends), I would still feel guilty or self-conscious. My mind was elsewhere: what I’d done wrong in the past, how I was compromising my future, and how I was wasting the present. I was so critical of how I was living my life that I couldn’t be in the moment. “A lack of play should be treated like malnutrition: it’s a health risk to your body and mind.” — Stuart Brown The real problem was my state of mind. I’d become increasingly adept at rejecting any form of “non-productivity.” I couldn’t allow any form of play if it didn’t contribute to earning money or doing something “meaningful.” Even when I was with friends or doing something that was supposed to be fun, I couldn’t stop thinking about all the time I was wasting. I wasn’t being productive; I was losing valuable time. I had to get back to work! Without realizing it, I became very serious, even though I’d never been serious in my entire life. I couldn’t play because that meant I wasn’t working, and I couldn’t really work because I always felt tired and jaded (because I never let myself play!) This resulted in me convincing myself that life was a miserable grind for adults, and that I needed to be very serious if I wanted to get through it. I approached everything this way, and treated my work as a form of self-imposed slavery. Little did I know how limiting that mindset was, and how much it was hurting my work… and my life. When I moved down to Austin, a friend introduced me to his buddy David via email, and suggested we should meet. David replied to me with the usual request: he asked if I wanted to grab coffee. I paused a moment, then wrote back: His response: And it was a blast. It removed the pressure of us having to talk and impress each other, so we could just focus on the game. I used to feel a bit nervous on first dates. I had to be “on” for hours at a time. The last date I went on was great — the energy wasn’t uptight at all because we played around the whole time. We ordered whisky Shirley Temples, shot cherry stems through our straws at random people, and cracked jokes about the karaoke singers. There were no attempts to be cool or charming, or thoughts about where this date might take us — it was all about making the moment fun. That’s how I’m approaching my meetings and dates from now on: What games can we play together? Life is funny. Back in college, I used to read Tucker Max’s website and think, “What a fun guy.” I’d go out with my friends and drink, and we’d try to create our own crazy stories. Now, Tucker is a close friend. We play homerun derby together every weekend. We come up with fun pranks we can pull. We make inappropriate jokes until we’re doubled-over laughing. I just finished six weeks of improv classes — three hours every Monday. Every session, I was thrust into situations where I was essentially guaranteed to fail and look foolish. At first, I was nervous and slightly mortified. My heart beat rapidly and I would sweat when I had to perform in front of 15 other people. But by the end of the six weeks, improv became a tremendous source of strength. All of us were there to play, to go with the flow and say “YES” to every possible situation we were thrown into, to cheer each other on and have fun together. We all looked foolish, but we all trusted each other. And that’s how it should be all the time — saying “YES” to every moment, knowing it’s another opportunity for you to embrace life and have fun. Improv, by the way, was the most effective remedy for panic attacks that I ever found. I’m signing up for more improv classes. I’m scheduling travel. I’m having fun because I’m making play a priority. And you know what? I feel 100 times better than I ever thought I would. I’m back to my normal self. I love life again. Play is where our subconscious naturally guides us. Play is the state where we are truly ourselves, once we let go of our egos and fear of looking stupid. Play immerses us in the moment, where we effortlessly slip into flow. Play allows us to imagine, to create, to bond with and understand each other. Play is what creates our strongest social circles. Play gets you around other humans, face-to-face, and allows you to form a real connection with them. Play allows you to stop taking your life so damn seriously, so you can start living again. Life was never supposed to feel so serious or scary in the first place! The people who try to convince you that it has to be that way just aren’t very good at playing. They’ve forgotten what it’s like. So have a laugh, remind them, then go find better playmates. Everyone is looking for someone to have fun with. Go out, create your own games, then get others to join in. Just play. You don’t need more money. You don’t need more free time. You can always do it, at any age. It’s only a choice: Anxiety or Play. Take your pick. “Man is God’s plaything, and that is the best part of him. Therefore every man and woman should live life accordingly, and play the noblest games… What, then, is the right way of living? Life must be lived as play…” — Plato",2013
Reflecting on Projecting,"Reflecting on Projecting Why Projection Happens Common scenarios in which projecting may occur for SIO readers: The Path to Presence The Fast Track to Kicking Your Projection Habit A version of this article originally published at stronginsideout.com on May 2, 2013. I’m in NYC for the first time in 10 years, and I have to say that I’m experiencing quite an array of emotions. I rode the Peter Pan bus in, arriving 45 minutes behind schedule because the driver had to do a “bus safety check” (i.e. stop at Burger King). I was already anxious about being back in the city where all the s*** hit the fan for me. 10 years ago, I was in a very dark place. My memories of this city consist of sobbing uncontrollably while my wide-eyed college roommates stood looking at each other, helpless; long nights drinking bottles of cheap wine; and walking home every night while talking on my phone for safety in a BAD part of town… I came to New York, expecting over-stimulation, rude, abrasive people and days locked up in my room just to get some peace and quiet… because that’s how I left this city. That’s what I remember. As the bus turned down Columbus Ave from Harlem, memories wafted back like a wave in the face as we drove by my old dorms on 79th, and continued down my old walking route to school. My head swam in anxiety, sadness, and… relief? As I looked out onto all these memorable places and routes, I felt a deep sense of relief for not being in that darkness anymore. The sensation shocked me enough to break me out of the act of projecting, which I was doing without realizing it. I started simply taking in the city without projecting my past onto it. I checked in to my beautiful apartment, which is pretty much the opposite of my windowless bedroom in Bushwick-before-it-was-hip that I lived in before. Nearly everyone I talked to on my way through town were all very warm and courteous. I walked all around Greenwich and the West Village from Midtown in the rain on Monday just because I wanted to take in the city. Instead of feeling over-stimulated, I became inebriated with the life and culture of my surroundings. The parks seem more beautiful and green this time around. The architecture more striking. The people more engaged and downright fascinating. I discovered some near-perfect coffee shops to work in with welcoming, helpful baristas (my favorites so far being McNally Jackson Bookstore Cafe and The Coffee Foundry). And I became inspired all over again… When I stopped projecting my past onto my present, my experience became a beautiful surprise. Have you found the same to be true for you? Many people who have a history of trauma, depression, anxiety, or otherwise bad times, can project their past onto situations or even people, which keeps them from actually experiencing the present. In fact, we’re all guilty of this, mental issues aside. When was the last time you walked into a situation and were surprised that it didn’t turn out like you thought it would? I talked about the idea of opening up your perspective in Explore Happiness & Remake Your Life. Today, let’s talk about how you can avoid projecting, and allow yourself to experience life anew. When you project your past onto your present, you are inviting that experience into your life yet again. If you, like me, have a darker past, it can keep you from seeing the good in your present surroundings. It can keep you from being surprised… which is why most people do this in the first place. It’s a subconscious decision to project; your mind says, “Ok, we’ve been here before and it was crappy. Don’t expect anything better this time around, you’ll just be disappointed.” Don’t be mad at your subconscious. She’s just trying to protect you, overbearing supervisor that she is. What your subconscious doesn’t realize is that projecting can cause more harm than protection. If you work so hard to put your past behind you and move on to a better, happier life (as all of us here at Strong Inside Out work to do), what good does it do us to dig that past back up and throw it back into our present? That’s exactly what’s happening when we project. The only way to stop projecting is to become aware of the fact that you’re doing it at all. How do you know if you’re projecting, or if you’re actually taking in the situation for the first time? First, stop any cycling that may be happening in your head by taking a deep breath in slowly and letting it out even more slowly. Find your calm, then ask yourself these questions: If your answers lean more toward the affirmative, you’re most likely projecting your past onto your situation in the present. Take another deep breath and look around. Bring yourself back into the present by centering yourself on a few of the things going on around you right now. What does it smell like? Is it cold, hot, windy, raining, dry? What does it sound like? If you’re projecting on a person, root yourself in how this person makes you feel NOW. Don’t worry about what the future holds, or what they did in the past that upset you. What are you getting out of this now? Use all your senses to become mindful and root yourself in the present moment. If you find that you’re constantly projecting, your past is obviously still affecting you today. Have you dealt with what happened to you? Even if this wasn’t what others would deem a traumatic experience, if it’s still bothering you, it was traumatic to YOU. It affects your world. If this sounds familiar to you, I highly suggest that you find someone to talk to and an outlet for the energy that your past brings up. You have to deal with your past in order to move forward. It’s so scary. Believe me, I know. There’s just no way around it. As frightening or daunting as it may seem, taking the reigns to deal with your past is empowering. The simple act of making the choice can get you halfway there. So do exactly that today if you haven’t already. Talk it out. Get it out. Let me know how it goes.

An Entire Human Life Cycle As Dictated By Quora’s Recommendation Algorithm, ,2013
Perspective — Faith & Politics,"Perspective When you are going through a trial, it can feel as if your world has just come crashing down around you. The future is uncertain and it is difficult to see how you will ever come out the other side. I have certainly had my share of trials and am currently immersed in one of the most insurmountable I have ever faced. Through the fear and the tears, one day I turned on the television and flipped over to GETV to watch a sermon by Matt Hagee, entitled, “Help is on the Way!” A minute or two in, he started preaching on victory through Jesus and overcoming our trials through God’s power. Well, it was just too painful to listen too, because, frankly, I saw no hope in my present circumstance. My husband and I had been believing God for an answer, a way out, but none had come and it seemed that all hope was lost and that God did not seem to be responding the way we believed He would. So, I fast-forwarded. When I hit ‘play’ again, I heard these words: “They were thrown to ravenous lions in the Colosseum, they were crucified, they were burned, they were buried in bags full of vipers and snakes…” Needless to say, I realized this wasn’t going to be the type of sermon that I thought. I backed it up to listen to the message in its entirety. Matt Hagee was telling his church about the suffering that Roman Christians were enduring at the time the following verse was written to them: “And the God of peace will crush Satan under your feet shortly.” In listening to the fiery trials that the first Christians faced on a daily basis, mine seemed to fade a little and I thought of the word perspective. It really is all a matter of perspective. The trials we are going through can seem so overwhelming to us. They can shake us to our core, make us question our faith, wonder where God is through it all. Many are so overcome with anxiety that heart attacks are a leading cause of death among Americans and others are so filled with despair and turmoil that suicide numbers are at a record high. Yet most of our suffering, in free and prosperous America, pales in comparison to the great persecution and martyrdom of God’s people throughout the centuries, and even now in other parts of the world. When it looks like all hope is lost, we must get some perspective. The perspective that God is still on His throne, that He holds the keys to the universe, and that even if we lose everything, we still have our Salvation and the promise of eternity in Heaven with our Savior. We also need to remember that what we are facing could be so much worse. There is always someone going through something far worse than what we are. Count your blessings. Realize how much you have. The United States is still a very blessed nation, despite our departure from Godly principles and impending judgment, and, for most Americans, the worst case scenario still ends with a roof over our heads and food on our table. But, Jesus tells us that we shouldn’t even worry about those things! “That is why I tell you not to worry about everyday life-whether you have enough food and drink, or enough clothes to wear. Isn’t life more than food, and your body more than clothing?” (Matthew 6:25, NLT) This is God’s perspective. He commands us not to worry about our clothes or food or even water. In fact, He commands us not to worry at all. Consider the context of the previous verse. (Emphasis added.) “No one can serve two masters. For you will hate one and love the other; you will be devoted to one and despise the other. You cannot serve both God and money. That is why I tell you not to worry about everyday life-whether you have enough food and drink, or enough clothes to wear. Isn’t life more than food, and your body more than clothing? Look at the birds. They don’t plant or harvest or store food in barns, for your heavenly Father feeds them. And aren’t you far more valuable to him than they are? Can all your worries add a single moment to your life? And why worry about your clothing? Look at the lilies of the field and how they grow. They don’t work or make their clothing, yet Solomon in all his glory was not dressed as beautifully as they are. And if God cares so wonderfully for wildflowers that are here today and thrown into the fire tomorrow, he will certainly care for you. Why do you have so little faith? So don’t worry about these things, saying, ‘What will we eat? What will we drink? What will we wear?’ These things dominate the thoughts of unbelievers, but your heavenly Father already knows all your needs. Seek the Kingdom of God above all else, and live righteously, and he will give you everything you need. So don’t worry about tomorrow, for tomorrow will bring its own worries. Today’s trouble is enough for today.” (Matthew 6:24–34, NLT) It constantly amazes me how peaceful our lives would be if we just obeyed God! He tells us not to worry about anything but His kingdom and then promises that if we do, He will provide everything we need! He tells us over and over again how much He cares for us. He tells us to take His yoke because it is easy. He calls out to all who are weighted down with heavy burdens and declares, “I will give you rest!” What a wonderful God we serve! So, lay your cares today at His feet a get a little perspective. Think about those who have gone before us and what they have suffered. Ponder the trials of Christians in Muslim countries and the horrors they face. And then, remember that no matter what you are going through, no matter how difficult and overwhelming it may seem, God is still on His throne and He reigns forever, and as the song says, “The One who reigns forever, He is a friend of mine!” We have a friend in God and He would do anything to care for us. He is very capable and He loves us more than we could ever imagine. So why worry? Just give it to God and trust Him to take care of you. He will surely do it!

I Worry About Not Worrying — Then I Worry More!,"I Worry About Not Worrying — Then I Worry More! Dear Somehow Still-Alive Guy,  I tend to worry a lot. But then sometimes I notice that I haven’t been worried for a while. And then I get worried that there must be something wrong with me if I’m not worried — perhaps a tumor on the part of the brain that usually causes me to worry? Now, you might think that the fact that I am worried about not worrying should put to rest my concern, as I clearly still have the ability to worry, and thus don’t have a tumor on the part of my brain that causes me to worry. But then I wonder if it’s possible that the tumor on the worry part of my brain only causes me to not worry some of the time. All of this is to say, the more I don’t worry, the more worried I become. Help! Worried You Won’t Reply Dear WYWR:  An adult life of worrying was always impossible for me not to worry about. I hail from an American family of risk-averse worriers, who hailed from an Eastern European family mostly killed by Nazis. So, in addition to worrying about when the next malignant shoe will drop while I live a post-multiple-cancer life, I may know where you’re coming from, even if I’m generally happy when I don’t have something pressing on my mind, which is not always the case. We’re both in luck, however, because my wife, a psychologist who works with neurology and cancer patients, some who have been in war zones, tells me that a part of the brain related to worrying, the anterior insula, a subcortical physical clue that we were once reptiles, actually has been shown to increase in size when one meditates. And that kind of growth isn’t cancer. So it stands to reason that the anterior insula is not expanding of its own volition in people who don’t meditate. Although worrying can be practiced in a meditative fashion, I suppose. Another point of interest: Research shows that people who worry also tend to make better decisions in tense financial situations. So don’t worry if in the process of treating your worry with meditation your income takes a hit and you are hence considered less reptilian. (Obviously, this information suggests a correlation between the financially savvy and the slimy, and as I hope to achieve something approaching that former state, and therefore to worry more, I shall not dog such a progression.) I’m in no position to tell you if you have a tumor, but I can suggest that you’re not the first person without truly concerning symptoms to worry about the presence of one (see my most recent column, which tackled a question about MRIs and included a link to a scene featuring Woody Allen’s hypochondriacal character in Hannah and Her Sisters). Lest I harp on the obvious, there are plenty of fine physicians who will investigate your neurological health. My thinking? You’re probably worrying more intensely now that you’re “not worrying” than you did when you thought you were simply worrying all the time. That’s the way anxiety disorders work. They’re like the mafia. Just when you think you’re out… [fill in the blank]. Then, once they “pull you back in,” they feel like they pull you harder, and your worrying has hit a peak level because you think you’ve beat it but also that it could be watching you at all times, perhaps from behind the bushes. You’ll truly beat your anxiety — and few of us ever completely do, so let’s say “treat” (and “exist healthfully in concert with”) instead of “beat” — when you don’t think about it as much and just live mindful of what’s in front of you, in the moment. So, again, meditation. Don’t join a pyramid scheme or cult devoted to it, unless you’re into that sorta thing, but maybe get an audiobook or mindfulness app. Steve Jobs meditated, and according to his biography, he was fairly cool, unless he was trying to crush you. What you should be concerned about is if you’re worrying less and engaging in risky behaviors, aside from writing to advice columnists in our age of NSA surveillance (although, please note, readers: sending me a question for this column to alive [at] theawl.com is as confidential endeavor as we can make it without government connections). Worrying is an anticipatory function and survival tactic: it prevents us from putting ourselves at risk for danger. If you start engaging in bizarre and dodgy behaviors — robbing American Doll stores, say, or stalking Christopher Walken to force him to play chicken with you on an empty highway, and if you’re worrying significantly less at these times — there’s at least one oddly bad thing going on for you upstairs. For now, why not seek out a therapist, and an MD if recommended, and try some deep breathing and long walks in nature. If you end up on psychotropic meds after seeing a doctor, make sure you don’t get the kind that might increase anxiety, like Wellbutrin, and that you stop drinking those triple espressos — except, that is, when you and your parole officer are simultaneously concerned that you’re not worrying enough. Dear Somehow Still-Alive Guy:  What are the different diseases I can get from my dog sleeping in my bed? Animal Insomniac Dear AI:  I have never co-habitated, much less slept with, a dog. A German shepherd once attacked my mother as a teenager in a locked piano practice room, and we were subsequently raised to fear most animals, including some hirsute people. It’s been huge progress for me simply to get to the point where I want to be around animals, and I still don’t want them to lick me, although I can’t say that also applies to all humans. That said, here’s a comprehensive list from the CDC of diseases you can get from dog germs. Interesting to note is that if you’re in any way immunocompromised — which doesn’t just apply to people with HIV but to those being treated for cancer, recovering from organ transplants, taking immunosuppressants, young children, or pregnant women, among others — you’re at a higher risk for getting Spot’s possible leptospirosis, a.k.a. “Rat Catcher’s Yellows,” “Black Jaundice,” or any other variety of terms used to describe just one dog infection that begins like a flu but could end with meningitis. If your dog goes outside, there are a few other things on that list to worry more about, like tick-borne diseases. Talk to your vet about Frontline and other anti-tick and anti-flea treatments. My general rule — if only because I’m not ready for all the licking and wet-dog stuff, and like to travel — is to not be a dog’s “father” but a dog’s “uncle.” I visit, with hand-sanitizer in tow, the dogs of my friends, pet them, bring them gifts. Then I leave after a few hours without any same-bed sleepovers. If you’re at all concerned about these things, you might look into how you can live without a dog. Most people, however, tell me that their lives are much better with a dog than without one (that whole unconditional-love thing). I mull this over now and then, but despite my desire for more adoring and obedient companions I have not changed my attitude about the dog-parenting business. It’s so hard to take care of oneself that some of us get to write advice columns in which we can discuss medical problems because of our breadth of experience with them.

Digital Detox: Baratunde Thurston on Rediscovering Life,"Digital Detox: Baratunde Thurston on Rediscovering Life For over a year, I have used what’s called a digital detox — time spent completely disconnected from the internet — to refresh and relax. Sometimes, it’s just for a day, other times it’s for a couple hours. I spend that time getting away from work and setting boundaries between my digital life and my personal life. That’s why I was happy to read Fast Company’s latest issue, which features this article from How to Be Black author Baratunde Thurston (“#Unplug: Baratunde Thurston Left The Internet For 25 Days, And You Should, Too”). In the article, Thurston describes the loneliness and anxiety he felt from being over-connected. This led him to go on a digital detox for an extended period. It wasn’t easy for him: after all, he is a media entrepreneur who owns a technology company. But through the process, he acknowledged what he really sought was to “be mentally free of obligations, most of which asserted themselves in some digital fashion.” And with this, he began to disconnect from social media, email, and other digital tools that had gone from fun diversions to obligations. As Thurston begins to disconnect, he starts doing things he hadn’t done in a long time: reading long books, talking to friends without sharing the conversations on social media, and enjoying Brooklyn, his hometown. In the midst of his digital detox, he realizes that living a life through social media, apps, and digital tools is unsustainable without time disconnected from the internet. It’s interesting the word we’ve used to describe disconnecting isn’t “vacation” but “detox.” I’m not that old, but even I remember a time when a vacation meant just that: full disconnection from the world. There was no email, no immediate sharing with friends or family via social media, no connection with the outside world except maybe the occasional phone call or a quick read of the newspaper. “Detox” suggests an addiction. A cure is needed. It is a cleansing of toxic substances. Why is it that all of this connection causes such turmoil? Why is it that we see it as an illness? To me, it shows how over-connection affects our psyche. We start to live our lives through the tools that are supposed to make our lives easier, and then we become dependent on the tool instead of the reason why we use the tool, which is to connect and share with our friends, family and acquaintances. Just like Thurston, we stop using digital tools for quicker communication or more meaningful connections. Instead, we use them for self-gratification: notice me, validate me, make me feel important. The idea of not having that validation creates anxiety, so we check our notifications or log on to our social media, obsessively tracking what people say about us. Algorithms like Klout scores replace real experience. Your social influence is decided by the same digital tools that helps you build that influence. Don’t misunderstand me: I’m not advocating for a complete withdrawal from the internet. I’m not a luddite. But I do acknowledge that for many people, too much connection can lead to anxiety, depression, or at least a sense of ennui. Studies do support this idea. One report from The University of Edinburgh shows that people who have a high number of friends on social media show higher signs of stress. It appears to be a perception issue: the more people interact with you, the more you feel pressure to maintain that level of interaction. Since our social media sites tend to represent us at our best, it’s difficult to maintain that level of interaction, leading to stress and anxiety. Even though I’m not nearly as connected as Baratunde Thurston and wouldn’t even pretend to have his level of influence, I get burned out on social media and digital culture. I have to step away and disconnect for significant periods of time. While I’ve never disconnected for weeks or months, I take regular breaks from the internet. The term “detox” does seem appropriate. After a couple hours of disconnection, you begin to feel less pressure. I get more writing and reading done when I remove myself from the internet. I also enjoy my time with friends or family when I’m not checking my phone every time there’s a lull in the conversation. I’m not worrying about that email I just saw come through. Overall, the internet is a good thing. It has helped professionals fashion careers from home without missing out on vital networking or social interactions. It helps people who have niche interests or hobbies connect with like-minded people around the globe. This site wouldn’t exist if it wasn’t for the community of readers that join me each week. I love the discussions on book culture and technology that I get to have with readers. Yet, I like to have time where I don’t feel pressured to comment, like, +1, RT, circle, or poke. I disconnect on the weekends for an afternoon, or a whole day, and when I do, I find more time to finish projects or reflect on my goals. For most people, that’s all you need. Just disconnect, and do so when you need it. Thurston’s article has several suggestions, so check it out, and take time this summer to enjoy life without the internet. Related articles",2013
"You Are a Wonderful Person, But Now Please Shush","You Are a Wonderful Person, But Now Please Shush Following my previous post on introversion, the delightful Emily Hauser directed my attention to a piece by Jonathan Rauch from 2003 that not only acknowledges the difficulty of being introverted, but also advises extroverts on how to help the introverts they love. First off, he makes a refreshing clarification: we’re not, by virtue of our aversion to social situations, dicks. Introverts are not necessarily shy. … Rather, introverts are people who find other people tiring. . . . after an hour or two of being socially “on,” we introverts need to turn off and recharge. My own formula is roughly two hours alone for every hour of socializing. This isn’t antisocial. It isn’t a sign of depression. It does not call for medication. For introverts, to be alone with our thoughts is as restorative as sleeping, as nourishing as eating. When it’s put like this, it doesn’t sound so bad, does it? I mean, hey, extroverts, you like eating and sleeping, right? Well guess what. But of course, the extrovert in question would have to take our word for it, that this is simply how we get by. And, well, they often just can’t. Extroverts have little or no grasp of introversion. They assume that company, especially their own, is always welcome. They cannot imagine why someone would need to be alone; indeed, they often take umbrage at the suggestion. As often as I have tried to explain the matter to extroverts, I have never sensed that any of them really understood. Same here, and that very much includes those closest to me, who love me most. At best, I can manage to squeeze from them a kind of resigned acceptance, a humoring, with a loving dusting of benefit-of-the-doubt. ‘This is just what Paul is like, and if I want to know and be with Paul, I suppose there’s no changing this.’ There is, of course, always the expectation that, despite my feelings, I will play along with the extroverts. They are the standard. When in Rome, etc. Rauch gets this, noting that it is the extroverts who get to be the ones to put in place social norms — and how could it be otherwise? Being primarily those doing the talking — showing up, as it were — the idea of extroversion as a self-evident virtue naturally ascends and remains firmly fixed. And as for we introverts? Whether or not we play along, we must lead our lives of quiet desperation, the extroverts all the while blissfully ignorant: The worst of it is that extroverts have no idea of the torment they put us through. Sometimes, as we gasp for air amid the fog of their 98-percent-content-free talk, we wonder if extroverts even bother to listen to themselves. Still, we endure stoically, because the etiquette books — written, no doubt, by extroverts — regard declining to banter as rude and gaps in conversation as awkward. We can only dream that someday, when our condition is more widely understood, when perhaps an Introverts’ Rights movement has blossomed and borne fruit, it will not be impolite to say “I’m an introvert. You are a wonderful person and I like you. But now please shush.” And not only would uttering such a sentence be a social felony, but the simple act of non- or half-hearted social participation itself is a misdemeanor, or, at best, a symptom of some horribly unpleasant (and slightly disfiguring) condition. But think again of the analogy to eating and sleeping. Personal interaction is the food and slumber of the extrovert. Imagine someone you knew, and even loved, told you that, well, they actually don’t like to eat or sleep, and actually try to do as little of them as possible. And if they must eat or sleep, they actually need to recover from it. Yeah, you’d think that was a bit odd. You certainly wouldn’t feel inclined to rewire the world or rejigger your own life to accommodate them. So as much as I want articles like Rauch’s to encourage the extroverts who dominate our world to better understand and appreciate their quieter associations, it’s also helped me understand why extroverts, like my wife, for example, can’t quite wrap their heads around why we are the way we are. It’s unfair that extroverts got to write the social rules to begin with, but it’s not like we tried to stop them, and it’s nobody’s fault now. So anyway, what can the conscientious extrovert do to be humane to their introverted loved one? First, recognize that it’s not a choice. It’s not a lifestyle. It’s an orientation. Second, when you see an introvert lost in thought, don’t say “What’s the matter?” or “Are you all right?” Third, don’t say anything else, either. Amen. Interestingly, Emily, who directed me to this article, noted that it turned a lightbulb on for her about her own son, 4 years old at the time. The fact that she realized this when her boy was so young is remarkable to me, for I don’t think my introversion would have been at all apparent to anyone, myself included, at that age. Indeed, I am told countless stories of my brazen openness to interaction as a toddler and young child, my constant efforts to win attention (which still exists, but not socially). Mostly what I recall from those years is a lot of positive reinforcement for who I was and how I behaved. It was not until he age of 10, sixth grade, when my family moved to a new area, that my life became very, very dark socially, with a constant strain of torment from my peers, when I had no choice but to retreat for fear of a kind of personal annihilation. But, I suppose, too, I began to notice a slight difference between myself and others a little before then. Even in the idyllic part of my childhood, before our move, I recall inclinations toward the indoors over the outdoors, and quieter, more imaginative, and less populated activities and games over mad childhood scrambles or sports. Now that I think of it, I think I did at least begin to prefer being alone. So perhaps I was already primed toward introversion, but I also have to assume that the barrage of negative reinforcement in middle school and onward, they daily flood of fight-or-flight chemicals in the bloodstream of a meek, thoughtful, generally sweet little boy, vaulted me well into all-out social aversion, where I remain encamped today. I denied it for years, for decades. It was an illness to overcome, I thought, a fault in my personality to be corrected. I don’t quite feel that way anymore. I am, if not proudly, at least affirmatively, an introvert. And if nothing else, I’m out.",2013
Pilbara mine workers unite to take on Rio Tinto,"Pilbara mine workers unite to take on Rio Tinto At the heart of the boom are the tens of thousands of mining industry workers — workers who have been on the frontline of massive workplace upheavals to cater for the boom. Australia is rich with various resources but our biggest export commodity is iron ore, the vast majority of which come from one the greatest iron ore bodies in the world in Western Australia’s Pilbara region. Shifting the 455 million tonnes of Pilbara iron ore each year are approximately 38,000 workers. Many of these are employed on a fly-in, fly-out (FIFO) basis. Employers argue FIFO offers the “flexibility” of working in the outback and living in Perth or other cities across Australia. But in reality workers have little choice. Accommodation in mining towns is scarce and expensive. Studies show FIFO tears at the social fabric of mining communities. It’s no picnic for workers either. Workers’ camps can become hotspots for alcohol and drug abuse. FIFO workers report higher rates of depression and anxiety, both from workplace stress and the isolation from family and friends. Earlier this year the body of a Rio Tinto employee who died in his temporary accommodation went four days before being discovered.Hard, dangerous and dusty workIndustry is quick to counter any hardships by highlighting the wages mineworkers can earn. But earn it they do — the work is often hard, dangerous and dusty. Standard WA mining rosters can be up to 14 days of 12-hour shifts followed by a week off — not talking into account travel time at the start and end of each shift — producing an average working week of 56 hours, or 84 hours a week in ‘on’ weeks. Suffice to say, Pilbara mineworkers have had little options for union representation. The biggest employer in the Pilbara is Rio Tinto, which operates 14 iron ore mines, three ports and 1400km of rail network. Like many employers in the region Rio is aggressively and unabashedly opposed to workers unionising. The majority of those employed at the multinational’s Pilbara operations currently work without the option of having a say in their working conditions. During his time as Rio’s iron ore boss in 2011, current CEO Sam Walsh said greater unionising of Pilbara iron ore operations would threaten the country’s productivity and export performance. He described his company’s ruthless push for individual agreements as “maintaining direct contact” with employees. FIFO workers report higher rates of depression and anxiety, both from workplace stress and the isolation from family. Productivity is often cited by big business when pushing for greater industrial relations deregulation, but like much of that debate, Walsh’s claim is a furphy. Mining companies are typified by their love of the unsustainable quick fix and this is what happened in the non-unionised Pilbara when workplace change was simply imposed rather than negotiated with workers. Individuals often agree to work long hours for more money, especially when it’s the difference between having a job or not. But very few make a career out of 14-day runs of 12-hour shifts. Spouses lose interest, marriages fail and kids grow up hardly seeing one of their parents. Workforces that bargain collectively are much more likely to take a long-term view, bargaining for hours allowing them to have a career and a family life. This is what happened in the more unionised mining operations of the NSW and Queensland coalfields, where productivity growth over the last 20 years has usually bettered that of the mostly non-union metal ore mining industry with its higher employee turnover rates.Unions gain a foothold in the PilbaraPerhaps the real reason Sam Walsh sought to scaremonger about unions was that 2011 was the first year in two decades unions had regained a foothold in the Pilbara, with the Construction, Forestry, Mining & Energy Union (CFMEU) striking an agreement to cover Rio’s rail workers. The CFMEU hopes to go further in their historic pact with The Australian Workers’ Union (AWU) to bring back collective bargaining choices for all workers in the Pilbara. The two unions have joined forces to form the Western Mine Workers Alliance, and will also draw inspiration from AWU members at Rio’s Bell Bay aluminium smelter in Tasmania who won collective bargaining rights for the first time since 1994. AWU National Secretary Paul Howes said the memorandum of understanding was based on the 2003 alliance struck between the AWU and the Maritime Union of Australia that resulted in offshore oil and gas workers finally having a say at work. Howes conceded one reason unions were shut out of the Pilbara was demarcation differences between the CFMEU and AWU, which Rio infamously exploited to its advantage during a bitter anti-union crusade in the early 1990s. “The alliance will herald a new era for workplace representation in the Pilbara after Rio ruthlessly exploited our differences 20 years ago, something they will not be able to repeat with the two unions working together,” Howes said. CFMEU General President Tony Maher said Rio should not feel threatened, given the trend for members to push for long-term sustainable work practices during bargaining. “Rio likes to talk about offering a direct link with its employees,” Maher said. “But this will be the first time in 20 years that Pilbara mineworkers will have a say in their working conditions. “For two decades workers have been denied the option to collectively bargain something they should be able to take for granted in a modern workplace. “We’re committed to ensuring productivity as it means long-term job security for our members. Rio should welcome that.” Join the campaign to make the mining boom work for all Australians.",2013

Aging with Anxiety,"Aging with Anxiety I volunteer at a hotline for elders to call in and talk. Talk about what you ask? We talk about anything and everything. While I’m nowhere near the winter years of my life, I can actually be a son or even a grandson to these callers, I can empathize with them and the issues they deal with. Aging with anxiety is never pretty. When the mind is rummaging with fear and inner turmoil, the comfort of living becomes more difficult. It becomes harder to deal with other emotions that will inevitably surface, like grief, anger, and loneliness. Not that I know first hand, but through observations and conversations with elders who suffer from anxiety, I know that life is much harder to endure. Marie (a client) deals with an uncontrollable sense of uneasiness. It wasn’t always like this. Life and all of its burden have just compounded on her over the years. In her mind, her worries are abundant but warranted. She worries about how she should spend her day, whether she should stay in or go grocery shopping. She worries about what her sister would think if she didn’t show up for her nieces’ birthday party. The guilt haunts her. She questions her faith if she skips church for one day. Her worries are constantly in motion, rattling her peace of mind. To her, it’s feels like life or death.

"Anxiety, ADHD, and the Basal Ganglia","Anxiety, ADHD, and the Basal Ganglia Overactivity of the Basal Ganglia Treatment Approaches for Underactivity of the Basal Ganglia Treatment Approaches for Overactivity of the Basal Ganglia The basal ganglia (or basal nuclei) are a collection of four deep structures in the brain, but they are grouped together under the same heading because they act in concert with one another. They are responsible for the modulation of movement, meaning stimulation and inhibition, when appropriate. Disorders of the basal ganglia therefore include those with both inability to initiate movement (Parkinson’s disease), and lack of control over movement (as in Huntington’s disease and hemiballismus). However, the basal nuclei has a limbic component as well (the limbic system is the seat of emotions in the brain). Thus, some of the disorders related to the basal nuclei include inability to stimulate behavior (such as in ADD/ADHD), and inability to control behavior — for example, Tourette syndrome (characterized by inability to control speech), stuttering, OCD, and anxiety disorders. Assuming we are not talking about cases involving the movement disorders listed above, those with overactive basal ganglia structures tend to experience: Overactivity of the basal ganglia usually corresponds to a relative excess of dopamine and a relative deficit of the neurotransmitters GABA and/or serotonin. Underactivity of the Basal Ganglia Remember, the basal ganglia help to modulate behavior, so they can be either over or underactive. Those patients with underactivity in their basal ganglia tend to experience: Underactivity of the basal ganglia generally corresponds to a relative deficit of dopamine and a relative excess of serotonin and/or GABA. The basal ganglia is also mediated by the neurotransmitter glutamate, and this one comes into play especially with the hyperactive variety (ADHD, see below). The well-known ADD/ADHD pharmaceutical Ritalin/Adderall works by increasing the available dopamine in the basal ganglia. (Cocaine also increases dopamine, but it does it much faster and its half life in the body is significantly shorter.) Because of this, side effects of Ritalin include those listed under overactive basal ganglia. First of all, I wouldn’t leap to the conclusion that you (or your child) has ADD/ADHD. In my opinion, it’s way overdiagnosed. Another possibility for these symtpoms is an emerging “condition” dubbed ADT, and it is a product of a chaotic and overstimulated environment (for more on this, read here). Second, many, many patients with ADD/ADHD do significantly better when food sensitivities are identified and removed, blood sugar is stabilized, and the gut is cleaned up generally. Sometimes these patients also have an overabundance of environmental toxins which disrupt dopamine levels. It’s important to remove food additives — some of them (for example monosodium glutamate, or MSG) can trigger stimulating neurotransmitters (in this case glutamate) and worsen hyperactivity. You’re probably getting the picture that these cases can be rather complicated. I’d recommend a full evaluation and work-up. Treatments for overactivity of the basal ganglia are essentially those for anxiety. Take a step back and pay attention to your thinking. You very well may be falling into one of the classic traps of overgeneralization, labeling, and worst-case scenario thinking. If this is you, I’d encourage you to check out this article. Once you’ve done that, you’ve essentially already done the hardest part! Here are six more self-help techniques that are very effective in controlling mild to moderate anxiety symptoms. Finally, because an overactive basal ganglia corresponds to high dopamine and a relative deficit of serotonin and/or GABA, I’d recommend serotonin precursors or GABA itself in order to modulate the high levels of dopamine. For resistant cases, I test for neurotransmitters through a company called NeuroScience. This tells me which neurotransmitters are high, which are low, and which precursors and cofactors an individual needs in order to help restore balance. Unfortunately the test is not covered by insurance, but I have found it to be very helpful for many of my more challenging patients.

The pharmaceutical companies may say the only real cure is to chemically alter your brain to make anxiety impossible to experience, but that doesn’t sound very natural to me… Surely the feelings of anxiety and panic are serving a purpose; to give us warnings and keep us safe in some ways. But it seems that due to a number of factors these signals are turned up too high or are triggered at the wrong times. And what about the host of potential side effects from taking prescription medication? Often anti-anxiety drugs may make you feel worse in other ways, listed side effects of popular anti-anxiety medication Venlafaxine are blurred vision, headaches, high blood pressure, chest pain, irregular heartbeat, mood changes, possible convulsions, swelling and changes to menstrual cycle. Who would want that? Who would risk feeling worse than they already do, with no real guarantee you’ll ever be free of the medication? Whereas if we look at the causes of the anxiety and panic attacks, take a natural approach and try to rebalance the systems responsible for those feelings of panic and anxiety, we would be working towards a more balanced response to the anxiety triggers. This may be the closest you’ll come to an actual ‘cure’ but it will be a natural one! By focusing on releasing nervous tension, emotional anxiety and the physical symptoms of anxiety and panic attacks, you will be able to gain a greater degree of control over your life, eliminating the need for prescription medication and at the same time enhancing your overall health and wellbeing, instead of jeopardising it with side effects. Shiatsu is an amazing natural massage technique that is especially effective when dealing with the connection between the physical, mental and emotional aspects of the body. Shiatsu is performed fully clothed on a futon on the floor or a traditional massage couch. A firm and steady pressure is applied with palms, thumbs and fingers to a series of energy lines and points throughout the body (meridians and pressure points, the same as acupuncture, but we don’t use needles). This pressure allows the body to release tension from the muscles, let go of stuck emotions, relax the mind and rebalance the central nervous system. Shiatsu helps in many other ways below the radar: promoting the correct balance of hormones and chemistry in the body to enhance health and improve feelings of wellbeing. The only side effects are beneficial; such as reduced pain and tension, improved sleep, looser joints and muscles, improved concentration, enhanced immune system, improved mental clarity and much more… Shiatsu sessions are generally 60 minutes in duration but can be 90 minutes or longer (by arrangement). A number of weekly or fortnightly sessions may be required to reduce the tension and anxiety levels to what feels manageable, then monthly maintenance sessions are advised to keep anxiety levels to a minimum. Extra sessions are recommended when experiencing greater levels of stress and pressure in life, to help you cope and carry on with your day-to-day life in as normal a way as possible. Simon has four London clinics and makes house calls within London and Bromley. Reduced rate/subsidised treatments are available if your anxiety levels impact on your ability to work or study. Please contact Simon on 07951 621 308 or simon@TheShiatsuGuy.com Remember a natural treatment for anxiety and panic attacks is available, with no side effects. You can start to feel the benefits in as little as 60 minutes! Originally published at www.theshiatsuguy.com on August 19, 2013.",2013
When Stress Is Good & How to Handle The Bad Stuff Better,"When Stress Is Good & How to Handle The Bad Stuff Better Acute vs Chronic Stress Alleviating Chronic Stress Schedule recovery days… or weeks Take charge of your life Originally published at stronginsideout.com on September 3, 2013. Word on the street is that stress is bad for you. When it comes to chronic stress, it’s hard to find a silver lining. But, not all stress is chronic stress, and the kind that’s not can actually be good for you. Here’s the lowdown on different types of stress: Before we get started, let’s define the different types of stress. Acute Stress: Short-lived stress (such as cramming for a test, or a car screeching to a halt as you walk across the crosswalk) Chronic Stress: extended periods of stress that are uncontrollable (such as an over-demanding job you’re miserable at, or being in an unhealthy relationship) Chronic stress is the cause of all the nasties (and more) listed at the top of this article. All-around, it’s something you want to avoid. Science has shown that acute stress, however, can actually be beneficial for you in many ways. Here are some of the many ways that acute stress can make your life better: Convinced yet? Ok cool… because there are a lot more benefits that I could list! Obviously, a little bit of stress ain’t such a bad thing in moderation (that “moderation” thing sounds all-too familiar, doesn’t it?). But what if you’re dealing with chronic stress? What if your stress-moderation has long since jumped ship? I got your back here, buddy. Read on for how I help people alleviate long-term pressure… The first step to fixing something is identifying what needs to be fixed. Use these questions to find out what the causes of your stress are: Use the answers from the questions above to direct you toward your major stressors. Most of your answers will point you toward one or two factors in your life. These are your sources of stress. How many times have you heard me recommend outlets? Well, you may want to cover your ears, because here I go again… I can’t stress enough (no pun intended) the importance of finding an outlet for your stress. There are 3 types of outlets that work best in conjunction with each other, but if one speaks to you more than another, concentrate on that one to start. Physical Find a way to get all that pent-up energy out of your system. Work it out in a way that you love best: run, hike, box, lift, surf, swim, walk, anything! Just focus on your movements and breathe. Creative Channel those emotions out into whatever kind of art you love to create. Write, draw, dance, sing, paint, act, photograph, you name it. Even if it doesn’t turn out as you intended, concentrate on just producing something. Let your creation calm you. Therapeutic Just because therapy is implied by the name of this particular outlet, it doesn’t mean you have to go pay someone for it. The therapeutic outlet can work for you in the form of talking to a good friend or family member, chatting in a facebook group, or even going to a book club meeting. Talk it out with someone you trust, who supports and encourages you to be your best self. That may be your therapist, or it may be your Mom. Whoever it is, open up and let it out. There are 2 ways you can go about this step if it applies to your situation at all: 1. Drop the stressor altogether Whether this be a person, job or even living space, you can make the extreme decision to leave it altogether. Now, that may bring up a whole host of stressful feelings, and that may be good or bad. Change is a frightening thing, but I want you to periodically ask yourself: If I didn’t have this major stressor in my life, would I be happier? Be honest, and take action to live the life you deserve. 2. Hire Out If you can’t get rid of the entire stressor, try outsourcing at least some of it. For instance, if your work is demanding too much of you, explore the idea of hiring a virtual assistant to take some of the menial tasks off your hands (like scheduling, taking calls or ordering items online). If you’re stressed because of a busy home life, try using TaskRabbit.com for everyday errands, start a rotating carpool to drop off and pick up groups of kids from school or drive them around to give you a little more space in your day, or schedule weekly play dates that rotate locations so that you can have some time to yourself every so often. Consider asking a close family member or trusted friend to do some of these things for you if you’re low on cash. There are so many ways to get out of daunting tasks thanks to the miracle of technology. Don’t let those nagging errands way you down when you can spend a little and gain a LOT of peace of mind. Ok, so not all of us can just up and leave our stressful job or forget about a loved one who’s sick, so here’s what I propose to you: just as you have to schedule in recovery days to give your body a chance to get stronger in between workouts, you can schedule in the same kind of “rest days” into your life to take a break from chronic stress. If your schedule allows, schedule a full day every week to take off from that stressor. Leave your phone at home, close your laptop, and go hang out in a place that relaxes you with friends who remind you of just how awesome you are. Can’t take a full day off every week? Then make sure you schedule in vacations, even mini ones. Having a little off time to look forward to can do wonders for your sanity. Funds a bit low for vacays? How about a stay-cation? Scheduling time off even if you stay home (just don’t tell anyone you’ll be at home) can be just as beneficial as paying moolah to go somewhere. Just make sure you’re committing to your time off, instead of using that time at home to catch up on work. Now, there are quite a few stressors that won’t be solved by any of the above tactics. One of the main ones is your health. You can’t outsource your health. You can’t schedule time off from being unhealthy. So I have a unique recommendation for those of you who suffer from chronic stress due to not-so-great-health. Make the choice to prioritize your health, then take baby steps to change it. Change is up to you, but that doesn’t mean that you’re alone in this. There are a ton of resources on Strong Inside Out to help you create individual health without scales or judgment (you know, the kind that lasts). Please use it! We’re here to help. Stress doesn’t have to rule your life. In fact, it shouldn’t. Knowing when stress may actually help you grow can help you release some of the resistance to it, allowing it to flow through it’s course instead of holding onto it and making it worse. You are the master of your life, and you do not have to struggle with stress just because it is universally accepted as the norm. Take charge. You deserve inner peace. Create it for yourself.

Are you heart broken? Don’t know whether to stay? go? or sit on the fence?,"Are you heart broken? Don’t know whether to stay? go? or sit on the fence? May be there is another way to choose. Wait for it… It is so simple… You have 3 choices… To the question: Can you accept him or her exactly as they are? and not expect or want any,… yes, listen again, I said any changes, ever!!!! Simple, no more dramas, no more complaints!!! Do you believe it is that simple? Here is a little more detail about the 3 choices! Let’s look at Yes = Total acceptance, heal your heart break and start to look at what you have not at what you don’t 1: Yes I do accept my partner exactly the way they are and the way they are not with all of his/her blessings, faults, annoyances, projections, values and beliefs. I know the reality of what he or she is and does. When we first meet our partners we see all the kind, loving and generous ways that they are, Right! After about 3 months we start to see everything, not just the good things!! They might blame us when they are in a bad mood, and now they are saying we are not perfect, and what we thought was cute was actually a put down! Of us!! If we can accept all the quirks and imperfections and accept that there is nothing we can do or not do to change any of these annoyances then we won’t complain. We will look lovingly at our partner as a vulnerable human being who is struggling in the world to find inner peace and love just as much as we are and we will support one another on our journey. If we say yes, we are also saying we accept and love ourselves and stand for being respected. We will be loving to ourselves and say no to dis-respectful and abusive behaviour and we will take responsibility for looking after ourselves, leave a room, go out or do whatever we need to do to look after ourselves. I am also not saying that behaviour can not change. What I am saying is that YOU and ME and WE can not change the behaviour of another person. It is amazing how many of us think that we can change someone else’s behaviour by doing something??? Strange isn’t it how we pick up these, what I see now as false beliefs! If we chose 1 yes acceptance for life. We have given up trying to change him or her, we have given up wishing she or he would do something different or be more caring or more of this and less of that. We have given up thinking they will be more loving when they get a new job, or when we do such things as dye your hair green!! I know that sounds ridiculous but so many of us do all kinds of things thinking that it will change the way our partner relates to us. Number 1 is a total yes, not a yes with a caveat. We will also accept the consequences of their behaviour and any adverse consequences you will deal with yourself. Now we can go about our life and create our own happiness and share that with our partner and not get offended or hurt or dis-appointed in anything they do or say or do not do or do not say. And if we are dis-appointed, or sad or unhappy or hurt we will look at what we can do to heal ourselves from within and we will take responsibility for our sadness or dis-appointment. We will not project that dis-appointment on to our partner as we agreed wholeheartedly that we could accept then just the way they are and do want to change them. Right? Well can any of us do this? People do. For those of us who can not accept their partner just the way they are there are two more choices. 2: No = I Don’t Accept My Partner And Can Not Live With Them If we choose number 2 No, we do not accept the way our partner may blame us for the way they feel. We do not accept that they abuse me or belittle the children, or doesn’t go to work or whatever it is that we do not accept. These are just examples, each one of us has different things that we accept or do not accept. The consequence we have a choice to leave this relationship which we do not accept. As we acknowledge that there is nothing that we can do to change this person and their behaviour is dis-respectful and intolerable. So give yourself permission to leave and leave gracefully. Be loving to yourself and look within at how you were attracted to some-one who does things that you can no longer tolerate. If abuse, are you abusing yourself? Start to be loving to yourself and you will attract a person who is also loving to themselves and can share love with you. And I know it is a lot more complicated than that. That is the topic of another blog. Now let’s look at the 3rd Choice 3: Maybe = I am sitting on the fence, half in and out. If you are in this camp and you can not tolerate the behaviour of your partner but you do not want to leave and you do not want stay you have chosen “Maybe”. When we are choosing “Maybe” we will probably complain a lot about the relationship. We might even be someone who takes themselves off to a myriad of counsellors and courses looking at what we are doing and how we are co-creating this relationship that is abusive or intolerable. And we attempt to change ourselves and do all manner of things to get the other person to change. or we may fall over backwards and be compliant in the hope that they will change, or become a bully and boss our partner around until they cave in and become compliant, or anything in between Guess what, NONE of those things work for us or for our partners. I hate to give you the news but MAYBE is a pretty uncomfortable place to be. Often described as either stuck in the mud and floundering around with not seeing a way out, or sitting on the fence with barbed wire up your bum which is pretty uncomfortable or seeing ourselves as victims without the possibility of having personal power to create what is best for ourselves. “Maybe” usually has conditions, which are nearly almost never met. “Maybe’s” also have fantasies that things are going to change when they do something. Like there is just this one thing that annoys me, I know she will change that when we are married. Or once I move in with him then I will get him sorted!!! When he gets a better job he won’t be so cross. He is depressed now but he wasn’t like that in the first 3 months of our relationship. Conditions don’t work for loving relationships. So what is it going to be? Yes No Or Maybe Your choice, your life!!! The first version of this blog was posted on Huffington Post",2013
"Plouffe’s New Hairdo’s State of the Union: A Shining Past, Present, and Future","Plouffe’s New Hairdo’s State of the Union: A Shining Past, Present, and Future PAST: PRESENT: FUTURE: So here it is, part 1 of the trilogy that makes up this post… As you may have already read (here or here), 2013 was a great year for me. So many things went well, the least of which was actually snagging baseballs. From making new friends, to experiencing REAL mountains for the first time, here is a visual history of my 2013 (in the form of some wonderful collages)! Photo #1: “Persons, Places, and Things: The Nouns of 2013” The photos above are in chronological order; it starts with the season ticket package that I received in the mail (February or early March?) and ends with my ever-growing collection of baseballs. Can you spot the new friends I made at the field? Shawn, Zack, Cam, and Eamon are the highlighted friends, the ones I had a decent picture taken with — I hope to add a few more friendly faces for the 2014 post. if you decide to visit Target Field (All-Star Game?), let me know, I’ll definitely go out of my way to accommodate and show you the real Minnesota nice. Most of the other pictures are also on the blog, but the 3 photos I took of high school baseball/high school baseball fields were featured exclusively on my Instagram feed (link on the widget area to the right). It started with a photo of Butts Probst Field in Wilmont, then went to my old stomping grounds in Forest Lake, and shortly after that I saw a practice happening in Lakeville while attending my father-in-law’s soccer game (he’s a coach). The biggest photo is that of the snow game, April 12 to be exact — fitting since I just saw the first flurries of the 2013–14 winter season today. Photo #2: “Group Shots By Game” OK, so the first photo is actually of the first three games in Spring Training — I didn’t foresee making a semi-uniform template for my blog, so I didn’t take “group/haul shots” after the first three games. The last two pictures are from my Photo Review post a few weeks back, detailing the group shots of all of the tickets/giveaways and then all of the balls and memorabilia. Photo #3: “Every Single Baseball” This is the photo that I dreamed of when I realized that I had a photo of each and every single ball (a few times I got balls so quickly I put two in a photo). My wife has taken on the challenge (actually she offered) of making a slideshow of the collection from the photos above — look for it on youtube see the embedded video below. I don’t know about you, but HOW COOL IS THIS?! [youtube=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_6piZrxpbU&w=420&h=315] Coming off the high of such an awesome picture, it is the perfect time to reveal my “Highlights and Lowlights of 2013.” ***Look out for the segue!*** No!!! Segue, not Segway! I mentioned my trip to Denver multiple times already, so how about a fun breakdown of… As I may have mentioned before, I hate to fly. One of the worst things for my anxiety is an upcoming flight. The flight itself is pretty bad, but the gnawing anxiety of knowing that in a week, a month, THREE months from now I’ll have to be boarding a plane?! It slowly kills me. While killing might be used in a metaphoric way, I have learned that prolonged increased anxiety levels actually do take a toll on the heart and can increase your likelihood of developing heart disease — you’re welcome; just another reason to keep you mental health in check. Since flying is all but off the table (I’m slowly working my way up to taking a flight again), I drive to all of my baseball games. this last year saw me head to spring training again as well as out to Denver in July. Those two large trips, coupled with the half-hour-ish one way trip from my house to Target Field really added up. Here’s a look: While my walking may not be über-impressive, I still nearly completed a marathon just walking/jogging to the field (not even counting once I was in the gates). Driving on the other hand? I could have driven a little past Buenos Aires, Argentina or Tokyo, Japan if I would have started driving one way from my house. Here’s a link to prove it. The distance and lack of decent navigable roads to Buenos Aires do not allow a route on Google Maps, but here are the pinpoints: I could have nearly made a round trip with Mateo to Colombia. And for an even more comprehensive look at the places I could have went via my mileage, here’s a list (via a Distance Calculator site): I could have driven to Tokyo or Moscow?! Heck, even a round trip to Iceland or Venezuela!! That is insane!! Lastly, in the “Past” section, I want to announce the following: Thanks to you, dear readers (I now know that there are multiple readers), this blog made it to the top 50 fan blogs on MLBlogs.com. Here’s the link, and below is a screen-shot. My screen isn’t big enough to capture all 50, but it is an incredible honor to share the top 50 with a handful of other bloggers that I not only follow, but met/went to games with in 2013 — I’m looking at you Mateo, Paul, Shawn, and Zack! Number 37!! Wow… I almost didn’t find out about the honor, until someone mentioned that Shawn had made the list. I wanted to check it out and see where all of my friends (since many of them had been on the list in previous months) finished at the end of the regular season; SURPRISE! While the most valuable piece of 2013 was forming new friendships, the most important thing I was doing (for myself and for others) was trying to catch baseballs and memorabilia in hopes of raising a decent amount for NAMI.org. Back in February I gave a “pricing guide” which detailed the amount I would donate per piece of memorabilia obtained. I am now happy to announce the grand total: Add on top of that… (Thanks Paul “A Piece of the Game” Kom!! you’ll get a much larger shout-out in my Thanksgiving blog. MUCH larger!) PLUS, my employer matches any donations greater than $20, so that means the… Even though this total is very respectable, I still feel like I have taken more than I have given. Thank you for everyone for helping me, for listening to my stories, and for making one of my top viewed posts be the one I wrote in May on Mental Health Awareness Month. (NAMI stands for National Alliance on Mental Illness… check them out.) While I have more goals than the four listed above, the ones that made this list are the most important to me. If anyone would like to join me in my adventures, please contact me. I’ll see you at the park! …And with the future discussed with as much detail as possible (for now), I wish you a happy rest of 2013! There are only a maximum of seven games left in the baseball season, and then it’s a long winter. Stay warm and stay classy!",2013
Pull Me Out,"Pull Me Out A staple of pop culture and the subconscious equally, the nightmare of the plane crash didn’t really go away once we woke up to the reality of air safety. If not perfectible, the form has at least been retired from any speculative realm that might imply we still don’t know what we’re doing. Planes don’t crash as often as they used to, and the adage of a commute by car being more dangerous than a cross-country flight remains obnoxiously true. 2012 was deemed the safest flying year on record, with 475 fatalities. Only one of those accidents was in the United States — a FedEx-operated Cessna, with one fatality. Contrast that with the full year of 2005, in which there were 1,103 deaths, a figure which was down in turn from 1,593 in 1995. Contrast those with the apocalyptic year of 1985, during which 2,629 lives were lost worldwide in some of the industry’s most devastating accidents, and you can now get on a plane in your most comfortable tracksuit and pretty much know you won’t get any blood on it. Alow and aloft, commercial aircraft now operate with the surety and smoothness of clocks unbroken; they are seldom wrong even once a day. If you were to workshop a feared and fictive plane crash, it would look a lot like that year’s crash of Japan Air 123. Still the deadliest single-aircraft accident in history, it was a rare mix of mechanical error, overcrowding, and hypoxia. By the mid-eighties air travel had become so indispensable to Japanese life that Japan Air was using 747s for the slightest of island hops, which is like getting your Rolls-Royce out for a trip to the corner store. Four minutes after takeoff from Tokyo on August 12 1985, Flight 123’s tail blew off. Complete hydraulic failure and scary pitching-and-rolling ensued. On the cockpit voice recorder transcripts, the pilots showed symptoms of oxygen deprivation. But they kept the plane flying for 32 minutes before it hit Mount Osutaka. Four passengers of the 524 people aboard survived; the numbers of dead were further skewed by the remoteness of the region and a lot of jurisdictional bickering by the Japanese bureaucracy. Families of the victims, unable to properly visit the site, toured it by helicopter like unstoic heads of state. Flight 123 is representative of plane-crash mythology because of that half-hour ordeal during which the passengers surrendered any illusions, as the plane headed off-course, away from Osaka. A crashing plane is often just a burning building in the sky. Many aboard Flight 123 wrote notes to their loved ones which resulted in a found mosaic of self-exorcism. Was there a moment, on this plane or another, when the shared charge of death impending became euphoric? Only the survivors know and that’s redacted, sensibly, from most accounts. Even admitting to thinking about it feels a bit like rattling a beggar’s cup amongst a bunch of bones. Morbid or mendacious, my obsession with air accidents is all about the following item, which may or may not be fresh off the intellectual black market: At least in a plane crash, you don’t have to die alone. In 2001, there was an outbreak of plane crashes. The commandeered 9/11 flights were acts of engineered monstrosity; the perpetrators essentially took courses in how to crash a plane. The air-fatality numbers for that year look impossibly juked; 3,256, including lives lost on the ground, in the towers and inside the Pentagon. The data includes the 227 aboard American Flight 587, which went down over Rockaway, Queens on November 12. Flying into wake turbulence immediately upon takeoff, the first officer followed his training and worked the rudder pedals, which promptly broke the aircraft. The composite materials that make up the body of an Airbus A300–600 cannot sustain the kind of undue stress to the vertical stabilizer that was induced by the first officer’s tactic. American Airlines changed its training program accordingly and in 2009 retired the A300–600 from its fleet entirely. That day everyone still thought it was a terrorist attack. Similar to a Dickian precog dreaming exclusively of murder, one of the few recurring dreams I have that’s fit to print is of a jet falling to earth right in front of me. Sometimes I’m driving and the plane falls into windshield-frame from right to left; sometimes I step outside where I live and the plane flips gymnastically into view with the sky as balance beam. People die in them all the time — the planes and the dreams. I feel a migratory pull toward the scene that isn’t altruistic. It’s voyeuristic, maybe even heuristic. I’m not much of a joiner but I want to run screaming into the damage. An accident similar to Flight 587 in that it involved casualties external to the flight and a neighborhood being lacerated is the Cerritos mid-air collision of August 31, 1986. An Aeroméxico DC-9 struck a Piper Archer, killing everyone aboard both planes and 15 on the ground. The carnage at the scene was so gruesome, a first-responder recalled in the accident’s episode of “Air Crash Investigations,” that he went into a kind of color-shock and saw things only in a graduated form of sepia. Sometimes the brain is only okay with seeing certain traumas when it has filter approval, and maybe that’s why we have plane-crash dreams. On dream message boards, before misspelled hilarity breaks out, there is general agreement that dreaming of plane crashes means you have either a) set personal goals that are unrealistic or b) are losing control of your private and/or professional life. The numbers of doomed flights, like the addresses of notorious murder houses, are customarily changed. Asiana 214, last summer’s flight from Incheon, South Korea to San Francisco that ended up downed and then cursed by Orientalist memes, is now somewhat bizarrely known as OZ212. American 587 is now American 1749. Air France 445, between Rio and Paris, was Air France 447 before it flew into an intertropical convergence zone over the Atlantic on June 1, 2009 and didn’t fly out. Air France 445 may be viewed as the first postmodern plane crash. It took two years, endless premature narrative journalism accounts, and millions of allocated Euros to fully address a ludicrous question: what brings one of the most cutting-edge aircraft in the world, the Airbus A-330, straight down from 35,000 feet as if pulled by a giant hook? Besides obvious answers like ‘a bomb’ or the even more smug ‘nothing,’ the answer was found to be: man himself! You can make an airplane failsafe and utterly able to fly itself, but you can never remove the human factor. Not really, and not entirely. Flight 447’s computers recorded a number of in-flight errata after the plane’s airspeed, calculated by little outboard things called pitot tubes, failed to register. Ice crystals had incapacitated the pitot tubes, a contingency on which both Airbus and Air France were not uneducated. In its trenchant 2010 look at the accident, Der Spiegel reported nine similar occurrences on Airbuses between May and October of 2008 alone; moreover, Air France had issued a memo to all its pilots concerning pitot-tube failure. Like most memos, it looks really helpful in hindsight. Once the A-330’s airspeed-indicator kicked out, the autopilot switched itself off and one of the three living, breathing pilots corrected the pitch of the plane. The jet’s speed dropped 90 knots in less than a minute, inducing a stall; the plane began to fall at a rate of 12,000 feet per minute. Your aircraft cannot break a stall when you destroy lift by reducing airflow across the wings; pitching the plane’s nose up does that. Flight 447 hit the Atlantic at 65 times the force of gravity. Forensics and less intricate science — such as that all the lifejackets were still in their protective packaging and the oxygen masks were never deployed — found that Flight 447 was the inverse of Flight 123: most of the passengers didn’t know they were about to die. The A-330 literally fell out of the sky and landed, for lack of a better word, intact and belly-first. During the four minutes that took, everyone was strapped into their seats but presumably not braced for impact. In the middle of the night, assume a high percentage were asleep. On board was the wife of the pilot, Pierre-Cédric Bonin, who was at the controls when the autopilot disengaged; assume she had no idea her husband was about to end her life. This accident is not significant because of what it says about technology and mortal mistakes. It’s significant because it feels like the last of an era. There will be other plane crashes. But in its awful pathology, catastrophic mood and oneiric outtakes, Flight 447 was certainly the end of something — a century of hubris maybe, the wildest kinds of if-man-were-meant-to-fly trollery finally sustained. Flight 447 was the last air accident to surprise anyone, despite its initial engaging mystery. It’s a perfect coincidence that investigators, while hunting for the black boxes, used the same autonomous underwater vehicles that were used to find the Titanic. Rueing the sanitation of air travel and the removal of all reasonable doubt can sound glib. The fetishization of accidents is a pretty natural outgrowth of that lament. I don’t wish crashes on planes. I am theoretically open to the possibility of a crash being the danger, however small, that makes flying fun. If you fly nervously but find statistics to be comforting in times of stress, deciding actuarially that you’re probably not going to die in a plane crash and flying anyway is no less morbid than perusing plane-crash data at Stalinian remove. Statistics are still what happens to other people. Anthony Strain lives and works in Los Angeles. He thinks he may be the love of your life, or at least a love of a life.

3 Tips To Stop the Worry,"3 Tips To Stop the Worry I love the excitement and sense of accomplishment just from applying. I can release any ties to the outcome because I know we’ve shown up, done our best, and if it’s meant to be, it’ll happen. It’s a great reminder that success is in the action, not the outcome (click to tweet!) It’s taken me years to be able to not stress and obsess over how things will turn out, and looking back, I can see that no amount of worry ever affected what happened next. It really was a lot of wasted energy. So here are a few tips to help you stop the worry: To quote the late, great Bob Marley: “Don’t worry about a thing. Cuz every little thing is gonna be alright.” OK, you’re up! How do you help to stop the worry? Is there a particular situation that’s stressing you out right now? Let’s keep the conversation going in the comments below.",2013
Getting Back Up,"Getting Back Up Originally published at stronginsideout.com on December 6, 2013. I’m back in sunny (but freezing) Northern California and feeling soooo much better! Besides a little lingering congestion, I’m almost fully recovered. Thank you for all the well wishes and healing vibes! They did the trick! I’m starting to feel healthy again, though still a little shaky, and guess what. I’m afraid of getting back in the gym again! Gahhhhh! Wellllllllll, I’m afraid, downright excited and relieved that I have the strength again… but honestly, I’m going to have to start a few levels lower than where I left off… which makes trainer Amy a little embarrassed. We exercise-lovers pride ourselves on how we can keep up with the pack, maybe even lead it. We can lift, sprint and stretch without it taking us down for a day. We look at new workouts with giddy anticipation, eager to beat the challenge presented to us. But when we fall off for a few weeks, be it from sickness or by choice, the day we go back to the gym is no longer something to look forward to, it’s a day to dread. I can’t go in there and do beginner exercises! I’m past that! If I can’t do my HIIT workouts, I don’t want to go at all! THIS is the argument in our heads that begins the decent into ill health, keeping us from getting back out there at all. Your fear of going through the work that you feel you’ve already graduated from is barring you from realizing that strength again. It’s akin to the arguments we conjure up when we get floored by depression. I can’t get back into positive thinking! My mind is nowhere near as positive as it was before this bout of depression. If I have to start all over again, I’d rather just give up. Some people who experience a good run with happiness, but fall back into depression, think that the period of happiness was just a fluke. They think it was the forces teasing them with a flash of the joyful life they’ve always wanted, only to take it away and throw them back into the depths of darkness. The thing about happiness is that it is not a constant background entity. It doesn’t just come to us and stay forever without effort. Well, at least not to those of us who have chemical imbalances. ;) Like physical strength, a happy life is something that needs consistent mindfulness and work. I say “work,” but I mean it in a way that is devoid of the connotations of stress and hardship that are usually attached to it. Your depression, like your physical health, will come and go. That’s just how it works for some of us. Instead of lamenting about having to fight it all the time, rejoice in the fact that you periodically receive the reminder to never take happiness for granted. So whether you’re struggling with getting back in the gym or getting back into mindfulness and gratitude, start to argue back to that defeatist voice with the truth: you deserve to be strong and happy. Your life is not meant to be lived in the backseat. [tweet] When you give up the reigns, you give up your purpose here. You are meant to drive. You are meant to move forward, not to stay on the ground where you fell. If you don’t get back up, you are doing yourself a disservice because you are brimming with strength and potential that can shake the world if you just harness it! You are a kinder, more connected person when you are healthy. You, your family and your friends deserve to have that person around for a long time. You owe it to yourself–after all the hard work you’ve done before–to get back up and at least try. Having been through the work before, it will likely come back to you faster. You may even get stronger this time around. Last night, I took a calm, stretchy yoga class that normally would have left me annoyed because I didn’t break a sweat. I left feeling spent, but grateful. Grateful to myself for taking that first step. Grateful for the yoga class that was lighter than advertised. Grateful for the strength that I know will soon come back. It always does. Be patient with yourself when you fall off because you can never fall too hard. Just get back up when you can and never give up on your strength.

Suicide Snuggie,"Suicide Snuggie But for our purposes here, it started with a Snuggie. December 23rd, 2012. One year ago today. I needed a Snuggie, for my sister. For Christmas. It was what she wanted. And I wanted to get it for her. Because that’s what I do, every year — try to get what is wanted, what is special. Because that’s what I’ve always done — every day, every moment, try to make what is special. Bed Bath & Beyond — Simi Valley. Off the 118 in that no-man’s land between the San Fernando Valley and Ventura. Fire country. My dad, brother, sister, and I were shopping. Last minute, of course. And I was looking for that Snuggie. I found one — horribly ugly, a nauseous striped pattern of chartreuse and magenta. But it was a Snuggie. There was a frenzy to my shopping. Get it, exactly it. Make it perfect. Make it a good Christmas. Make it better than last year. Last year. When it all came out. Make it happy. Make it ok. Make it not dramatic. Make it not awful. Make it. But then I freak out, in the parking lot of the Bed Bath & Beyond, and then I hit my head on the trunk of of the car, and then I’m yelling obscenities at the top of my lungs, and running away, as far away as my logic will take me in the parking lot of that Bed Bath & Beyond, with the Jack ‘n the Box and the movie theater. And I’m crouching on the curb, rocking and crying, and sobbing and hitting my head, trying to forget. But who can forget? How can one forget? I think I hate December. And then it’s several hours later, and I’m home, we’re home, and I’m still screaming, still panicking, still rocking, still totally scared that I will never be ok, never be normal, never move past the stupid, stupid things I’ve done. And no one can help me. It doesn’t matter how many pairs of scissors you confiscate, how many Exacto knives you remove from my room, I will still wonder if there’s any point, if there’s any reason, if I will ever actually be ok. And somehow, the only person I trust, the only person I cling to, is the one I’ve punched, the one I’ve screamed at most, the one I’ve stolen Halloween candy from and lied to and cheated and judged and nagged. Somehow he’s the only one who can hold me right now. Brother, please help. Funny how that works. It started with a Snuggie, but that was just the tip of the iceberg. I remember calling you, and leaving frantic voicemails, from thousands of miles away. That must have been very difficult for you. I’m sorry. I remember sitting outside on the porch, visualizing you, sleeping on a futon or blow up mattress, snuggled amongst many family members, happy, cozy, ok. I remember crying, crying, crying, sobbing, and crying some more. I remember a lot of things. We remember a lot of things, in our lives. But what of that serves us, really? What really does it serve us to remember certain things, over and over and over What really does it serve me to remember a year before that? A year before the Snuggie? A year before that? And a year before that? And now, a year from then — a year from last — what does it serve me to remember that? Something, I suppose. I suppose it serves me something, to remember that pain I was in last year. To remember the porch, the phone calls, the screaming and sobbing. And even though you’re gone, to remember that you cared. To remember you, though? Does that serve me? To remember you? To remember her? To remember then? Maybe not. Maybe right now what serves me is to meet my mother at Nordstrom Rack. And shop for my sister. And be ok With whatever I find. Originally published at whaticanteven.com on December 24, 2013.",2013
Tony Stark and Me and Our PTSD,"Tony Stark and Me and Our PTSD On an episode in May of this year of the podcast The Incomparable, which is a great panel discussion show about whatever bit of culture, entertainment, or literature strikes their fancy, the topic was Iron Man 3. Somewhere in the middle of the conversation, Guy English takes the temperature of the group concerning the introduction of Tony Stark’s panic attacks, a symptom of his PTSD following the harrowing events of the previous film, The Avengers. There was general agreement that, yes, what Tony experienced battling the aliens at the climax of The Avengers would definitely fuck one’s shit up, but there seemed to be some ambivalence about whether it out of place in the context of the film in question. I quickly want to address what they did not, which is whether it was done well. I watched Iron Man 3 only recently, on my MacBook during a flight a month or so ago, and I found the portrayal of someone suffering from post traumatic stress disorder shockingly realistic. Let me qualify: I have only my own experiences to draw from. Read this to get a better idea of how I know anything about the topic — it doesn’t involve aliens. I do not at all want to assert that my experience of PTSD is universal or even common. It’s just what I know. All that said, I was amazed at how much I related to Stark in his moments of panic. I recognized my own behavior in his when one of his attacks set in. (For the sake of rhetoric, I’m going to use the word “you” even though I’m really talking about “me.) Something sets you off — a reference to an event, an association, a physical stimulus, what have you — and an animalistic fight or flight instinct takes hold. But it doesn’t necessarily own you entirely, you don’t turn into some werewolf in a waking nightmare. Your conscious mind is aware of what’s happening. You know you’re having an irrational rush of emotions and that your body is now compelled to act with sudden and overwhelming urgency. Maybe you run, maybe you fight, maybe you hide, maybe you scream, etcetera. All the while, you recognize that something not of your neocortex is in control. You may even be able to make jokes about it while it’s happening. So I was mightily impressed and very much surprised by the way it was handled in this movie. It would have been easy to overdramatize Tony’s episodes, to make them Hulk-like in their violence and intensity, to make Tony unrecognizable in those moments. Instead, they let them be very much Tony’s episodes. We got to see him become aware of something happening to him, see him comment on it, struggle with it, and even try to mitigate it based on circumstance. And yes, he could even have a sense of humor about it in the moment. What was so true to life for me was that Tony never loses all control in those moments, but you do see his whole body carriage change as though a new force were asserting itself on his body’s operation, as though he was the Iron Man suit, and his amygdala now the driver. We see a lot of troubled superheroes. Too often, though, their traumas exhibit themselves in brooding or vendetta. It was extremely refreshing to see a trauma manifest clinically in a superhero character, in a way I as a fellow-sufferer recognized. Indeed, Downey’s portrayal of PTSD episodes was so real to me, it mildly triggered my own responses, sitting there at over 10,000 feet, in the dark. My heart raced with his. My amygdala called shotgun in my mind for a little while. I understand why it might have seemed a touch superfluous to the Incomparable cast. There are a lot of ways to tell the story of Tony growing as a character and knowing what it is to have weaknesses and failings. But this way of telling that story was crystal clear to me. For a big, explode-y Hollywood blockbuster, they told that about as well as I imagine anyone could.",2013
The Big Sticker,"The Big Sticker So my wife’s dad (who is a really good guy all-around — just today he paid for two strangers’ layaway at Walmart without their even knowing because he’s just that kind of guy) bought my 4-year-old boy this giant-ass wall sticker-poster-thing of a T-rex and some other dinosaurs from a company called Fatheads. It’s freaking enormous, over 100"" across. And he’s in Alabama, so it’s not like he’s putting it up. It’d been sitting rolled up in its box for about a month, and I decided it was finally time, before Christmas presents overwhelmed all other thoughts in the boy’s mind, to get the thing on his bedroom wall. I wanted to surprise him with it. He knew it existed, but he had no real idea of what it would look like on his wall (and I didn’t either, really). So I wanted him to be delighted one day to come home from daycare and find it dominating his wall. The only way to surprise him with it, however, would be to do it when I was the only one at home. If my wife and I are both at home at the same time, so are the kids. Here’s the thing. I mentioned that the thing is freaking huge. The instructions even say, hey, dumbass, this should be done by two people. I’m paraphrasing. But I thought, well shit, it’s just a big sticker. I can do it by myself. Let me spare you the details and just get to the point. It’s a big sticker so of course I screwed a lot of it up. In wrestling with this enormous decal, I managed to get the T-rex’s head to fold its adhesive side onto itself, and in trying to undo it, I put a small rip in the dinosaur’s neck and hideously pocked its face with little creases where I tried to unstick the thing from itself. When I comically succeeded in getting the thing on the wall, I scratched some of it up using the smoother-outer thing that it came with. I was consumed with guilt. I drove to daycare to pick up the kids, and all the way I have this sick feeling in my stomach that I’d ruined his cool dinosaur wall sticker thing, I’d spoiled my own excitement for the surprise reveal, I’d damaged the expensive gift his grandfather had bought him, and I’d succumbed to my own impatience and stupidity in even attempting this fool’s errand. After begging my wife’s forgiveness for my sins, we finally showed the boy the giant dinosaur now overwhelming his wall. And, as you can guess, despite how bad I felt about it, he loved it. (The baby, however, was somewhat scared of it, though fascinated.) The boy even went into a kind of dinosaur frenzy, a mad excitement came to his eyes, and he jumped up and down on his bed growling and roaring. “I LOVE it!” he declared. Of course he did. But I still knew it was a little screwed up, and still felt pretty bad. The evening wore on, we got through dinner and baths and bedtime. I got a couple more looks at the dinosaur before leaving his room for the night. I came downstairs, went on with my evening, and I thought, well, maybe the dinosaur’s just fine. Maybe I don’t need to be so upset with myself about it. He loves it, it looks cool, the end. It’s a big sticker, after all. So I’m settling down for the evening. The baby has a cold, so while watching Breaking Bad on Netflix, the wife and I had to pause to allow the baby to get up for a few minutes until she was willing to lie down again. The show ended, the baby went back to sleep, and the wife put herself to bed as well. I think to myself, well, to be a genuine artsy-fartsy intellectual smartypants, I need to sit and read. But what I really wanted to do was have a beer, browse Twitter, and watch TWiT shows. So then I start beating myself up about how little I read, how slowly I read, how much time I waste, and how it all indicates what a waste of space, and generally crummy human being, I am. I’m paraphrasing. And then something happened. I stopped, took a breath, and I actually thought, hey, maybe I should cut myself a little slack. This thought stunned me a bit. It was an unfamiliar thought, an unfamiliar feeling, maybe somewhat unsettling. And then I thought, yeah, okay. I’ll get off my own back. Just for now, anyway. I don’t know if I can do it again — it’s novel enough of a sensation that I felt compelled to write about it. But this whole getting off your own back? I can see the appeal.",2013
My Name Is Hope,"My Name Is Hope I’ve seen this book get a lot of flack because the author “dismisses medication,” but that’s not what I got out of what little he said on medication at all. My impression was that, while not opposed to medication, he didn’t consider medication a fix but an aid that suppressing the symptoms of anxiety and depression while we deal with the root causes. I would recommend this book to anyone that struggles with anxiety and depression, or who has someone in their life that does. It goes beyond dealing with just certain aspects of depression and anxiety to address us as whole people. Whole people who have to deal with the physical, mental, emotional, and spiritual aspects of depression, not just one or two from the list.
