"A simple, short technique to beat Anxiety","Often there are worries that occupy our minds for days. More often than not, we are in fact aware that the anxiety is irrational and we engage in a mental conversation with the anxiety trying to replace it with rational thoughts. I’ve personally found this strategy to be ultimately useless. It doesn’t help in relieving in the anxiety much and doesn’t prevent anxiety from coming back. Instead, here is a simple, specific technique to beat anxiety that I’ve personally used and found useful :- Note that the while the last point isn’t in your immediate control (technically what you can directly control is what you write down in your test and not how many marks you score), I felt it was useful to juxtapose that against “how many marks others score” as that is something that’s almost completely beyond your control(Unless you’re willing to resort to Chatur Ramalingam’s strategies from ‘3 Idiots’) Do share your queries in the comments. I’d be happy to provide further explanations and examples. Also if you try it out, share your feedback with me via comments or PM. If a few people are curious, I might write a post later on why this works and why our usual strategies (e.g. imaginary arguments with anxiety) fail.",2017
other life,"In my other life I am not scared. I have no fear; I do not shy away from opportunities, I do not neglect to take chances, I do not lay awake at night wondering if I will die in my sleep if I close my eyes. I do not, in my other life, get into my car thinking surely this is the time I will get into a terrible accident. I do not answer each phone call with panic at my throat, thinking it’s bad news. I am not scared in this life. In my other life, I do not worry. I do not imagine that every time a loved one leaves the house it will be the last time I see them. I do not view every venture outside as a chance for something tragic to befall me. I do not, in this life, imagine planes falling from the sky, carjackings, heart attacks. I do not engage my mind in worst case scenarios. In my other life my hands don’t shake, my heart doesn’t skip beats, my stomach doesn’t do battle against butterflies. In this life, I am not always imagining the end of things: life, love, happiness. In this life I enjoy the little moments, I am present, I fully envelop myself in each minute, without thinking about how fleeting it all is. I do not, in this other life, doubt and second guess myself. I do not think of myself an imposter, someone masquerading as a good enough person, a good enough worker, daughter, sister, mother, wife. In my other life I enjoy my successes without eyeing them suspiciously. In my other life, I do not fear failure. I embrace opportunities, I take chances, I try without churning about in my mind the possibility that I won’t succeed. In this life I do not live in a constant state of anxiety; I am calm, I am rational. In my other life I realize it’s ok to be flawed, I accept who I am, I love myself unconditionally and let others love me without questioning their motives. In this life I appreciate myself and what I have to offer the world. In that life I create without fear of rejection, I love without worry, I embrace without pushing away. I live to the fullest, I put myself out there, I recognize what I have to offer the world without downplaying it. In this life, I am inside looking out. In my other life, I am there, beckoning. Waiting.",2017
Another Eve,"I started this publication one year ago today. And I haven’t touched it since the end of last January. Perhaps I am afraid of it. Perhaps I don’t feel I have anything valuable to write. Perhaps I just procrastinate. Or even better, perhaps I let my evil nature keep me from it. I find that I distance myself from many things spiritual. Sermons, spiritual conversations, church, even my Bible much of the time. I love my Jesus with all of my heart, but clearly, there is something going on inside of me that resists His call, His arms, and maybe even His comfort. So why do I pick up my computer tonight? Because it is the eve of January. And with it comes January Rain. January in my home has historically been a dark time. Depression, anxiety, doubt, and the loss of our third child. This publication is most likely more for me than for you. It is not highly filtered. And by that I mean, I say pretty much what comes out of my heart. It isn’t always great, or pretty. But I don’t really feel like life is all the time. I know that there is a Light in the darkness. God gave us a reminder of that last January when he gave us our 4th child, our little lightling. I hope to find encouragement in our Lord this month. And my hope is that you will too.",2017
Self-care for anxiety and panic,"The other day a friend told me she had a rough panic attack earlier that morning. In the moment I tried to listen and be supportive without offering advice. This letter is the advice part, in case she might find it helpful, and I hope it will help others as well. At times I’ve doggy-paddled haplessly amidst waves of anxiety and have had some unsettling panic attacks. I’ve since learned to cope pretty well and believe that if you’re not feeling a little anxious occasionally, you’re probably not challenging yourself enough. Here are the tips people have shared with me over the years. Accept yourself. Anxiety doesn’t define you. It actually helps us in a lot of ways, alerts us to trouble. Can be an amazing teacher. Might make you more perceptive. What makes you uncomfortable in some situations can give you an advantage at other times. Unchecked, it can tragically limit your life. If you can turn down the volume and listen to what it’s trying to say, it can point the way forward. Know you’re not alone. Lots of people feel anxious at times. It doesn’t define you. You can learn to surf the waves. Have empathy for yourself, and for others. Take care of the basics. Get plenty of exercise, sleep, water, real food. Quit caffeine? This was a big one for me — was a bit of an identity crisis, but well worth the effort. Life on the other side is much less j-i-t-t-e-r-y. Don’t use alcohol as a permanent social crutch — it’ll be harder at first, but practicing sober will strengthen precisely what you need to strengthen. Groom a bit and get a haircut. Wear clothes you like. Doesn’t have to cost a million bucks or consume all your attention. Some people have a tailor customize their thrift-store finds. Play. Do something playful every day. Develop a playful life. Expose yourself. Exposure therapy’s the most helpful thing. Think of it like going to the gym. To build skills, start challenging yourself a little each day. Start wherever you are, maybe just a smile or a nod to a nonthreatening stranger. When that’s easy, try saying Hi to a few people. When that’s no longer challenging, try a little small talk. Put a star on a calendar on the days when you actively challenged yourself. Walk around where other people walk. Toastmasters. Improv classes. Volunteer or work in customer service. Be a beginner. Slow and steady. Breathe. Mind follows body, body follows mind. Breathe in three counts, hold one count, breathe out four or five counts, repeat until you feel calmer. Breathe in deep and sigh audibly out through your mouth like the storm is over and you’ve reached a safe harbor. Meditate for five minutes a day. Observe your breath and thoughts without judging or evaluating them. Embody confidence, lightheartedness, tranquillity. Mind follows body, body follows mind. A few times a day, raise your arms high and push out your chest like you’re a runner triumphantly crossing the finish line. When stressed, it can be grounding to squat down like you’re playing marbles or talking to a squirrel. Try fluid dance moves. Make yourself laugh. Flex and relax your muscles one by one. Relax your face, your jaw. Reframe the conversation. Mind follows body, body follows mind. The physical sensations of anxiety and excitement are very similar to each other. When vexed, smile and say out loud, “I’m excited.” Try it with or without an exclamation point. Can get you unstuck and help you take action. Find delight. Whenever possible, play “what do I like about this?” We’re naturally skeptical, and vigilantly scan our environment and our mind for trouble and negatives. Balance this by consciously identifying things you like wherever you go. Could be as simple as a color, a shape, or a texture you like. Notice you’re no longer inwardly focused. Find a model. My yin yoga teacher Anne is the very personification of self-care, at least when she’s teaching. When I get troubled I think “Anne’s got my back.” It’s not about the specific person, but the qualities they represent. Your person could be Beyonce or Thich Naht Hahn. Find a village. Develop a rich in-person social network. America’s Disney culture focuses so much on romantic love. We can find ourselves believing a single person can do it all for us — oh my god, what the fook, laugh out loud, smack my head! Totally unreal, totally isolating, yet totally ingrained. It’s an incredibly fragile, stressful way to live. Do not put all your hearts in one basket. Expand your social universe to include best friends, once-in-a-while friends, at-work allies, business associates, hobby buddies, neighbors, teachers, support professionals, strangers, pets, other people’s pets. All can be an incredible help for a human such as yourself, moving through life. Same goes for your biological family — keep the channels open, but don’t expect miracles from your fam. They’re human like you. The more you’re able to meet your needs externally, the better you’ll be able to relate to your blood relatives. Try all the social activities. Be a beginner. Ask for help, with the goal of eventually teaching others. Help others without overextending. American social life is now something you have to create yourself or actively search for. But it’s imperative that we do.",2017
Impromptu,"Hey! Internet. How’s it going? It’s been a while since I’ve dabbled with the written expression. I haven’t expressed anything lately. I suppose it’s a good time to get started, this being my least favorite day of the year. Let me start with this, a picture of the most viewed item in my ArtPal gallery for the year 2016. As you know, Internet, if you’ve been paying attention this is called “The Journey Starts Here”. There’s a whole post about this particular drawing, from the previous moments in time, where I felt the need to express myself in a written fashion. You are a digitized being of sorts, scour your data banks or review the previous post I’ve made to familiarize yourself again with this drawing. Inadvertently, I’ve been observing the view count of each of the different pictures I post there and it has become interesting to see what others find interesting to view. Last year’s winner was “Pick One Mandala”. These two pieces are from the same series. I wonder what will be the winner for 2017. I doubt that it will come from the same series. I’m sure it has something to do with the title, which is appropriate for the upcoming year. The Journey Starts here for 2017, I’ll pick one of these circle and begin my journey. It’s been a rough 4 years, personally. I can’t speak for you, Internet, or the world or even the person who may happen to read this post. I guess I’m ready now to get started. Let me go paint a painting for my Mom. Until next year, Cya! Internet. P.A.L. (peace and love!!)",2017
Medication & Its Role in My Life,"I don’t really remember much of my life before I began medicating. How I felt, or what my perception of “normal” was. I know there became a time, though, when the decision was made that I should try some sort of medicine to help me pull through my depression. Depression hit me around the age of 14, and so began the relentless journey from pill to pill. Mental illness is just as real as any sort of physical ailment. Just because you can’t see that I am in pain, or can’t see how I feel, doesn’t mean I am not struggling. With me being able to hide how I feel so well, it always came as a surprise when someone close to me discovered that I am taking a medication to help me cope with my feelings, with my thoughts, with how to live. Mental illnesses, and how you truly feel on a day-to-day basis, are extremely hard to describe to someone who has never had such a challenge. Even if that illness becomes paralyzing, it still remains one of the trickiest things to explain to someone exactly how you feel. Fifteen years later, I am still struggling, minute by minute. My first diagnosis was Bipolar II Disorder, a less severe type of bipolar disorder characterized by depressive and hypomanic episodes. More recently, and by a different doctor, the diagnosis was Dysthymic Disorder, a mild but long term form of depression. These types of illnesses are usually treated with some sort of SSRI (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor). And while I believe that they can certainly help your quality of life, the majority of responsibility is yours. You can’t just take a pill and have it make you happy. I’ll touch on this in a bit. Shortly after the depression, anxiety began to take its hold. The cause is usually unknown, seemingly out of the blue. I remember my first two panic attacks very vividly, and they were truly the scariest moments in my entire life. Partially because of the panic and state of mind you are in, but also because I had never experienced anything like that before, and didn’t know what was happening to me. To this day I still get them quite often. More recently I have seemed to overcome the depression to a certain extent, but mostly struggle now with anxiety and an obsessive, overactive mind. And all the while I have tried countless drugs: Fluvoxamine, Quetiapine, Aripiprazole, Alprazolam, Sertraline, Fluoxetine, Escitalopram, Omeprazole, Venlafaxine, Valproic Acid, Amphetamine / Dextroamphetamine, Topiramate, Mirtazapine, Citalopram, Paroxetine, Ziprasidone. Some make things worse, some do help, but the side-effects outweigh the benefits, and some work for months, or even years, and seem to stop working. If you travel down this road, it will never end. There is a way, though, to a better quality life that I think most people don’t realize. First of all, I want to clear away the stigma that being on some sort of medication means you are “unstable” or “crazy” or you “need help”. Taking a medication is no different that someone who suffers from asthma having to use an inhaler. It’s no different than a diabetic needing insulin. Medication should be looked at as an aid, a crutch, something to put you in the right mindset so that you can get a grip and make real changes that could eventually get you off of any sort of medication for good. Medication is only a tiny part of this equation. The other part is all on you. You must learn to cope, and develop healthy practices that will benefit you. I didn’t realize this for years. I thought you could just pop a pill and be on your way. Not true. The most important thing to remember is that you must be proactive. You must advocate for you own mental health. Learn what it is that will best serve you, and incorporate those things into your daily life. What has worked for me? Seeking counsel. I have been seeing the same counselor since the age of 14. I was lucky enough to find the perfect fit right away. Finding the right counselor is not easy, so don’t be discouraged if after the first few counselors you aren’t feeling any connection. I truly feel, though, that establishing a third-party outlet for all of your feelings, concerns, thoughts, worries, and fears is crucial to getting on the right path. And for someone with low self-confidence, counselors can also boost your confidence levels by confirming or assuring you on whatever the topic may be. Journaling. This is what works for me. This is my outlet. Ever since I started feeling “different” I have kept a journal. It gets things out of my mind, and on to paper. For me, it clears my brain and work through issues that have been on my mind. I always leave time for myself at the end of each day to be alone and take care of my mind. Meditation and Yoga. Absolutely essential in so many ways. The trick is to be consistent. Don’t expect instant results. You must sit, every day, and practice consistently to reap the benefits. This is your “you” time. Time to clear your mind, cultivate inner peace, and beginning to understand your true self. Medical Journal. I keep a separate record of all of the details of my medications. When I started and stopped them, how I felt on them, side-effects, dosages, etc. This is really handy, especially if you’ve been on so many and begin to lose track. Self-talk & Affirmations. As silly as it sounds, self-talk is a big tool. You create your own reality. And so by repeatedly saying to yourself, out loud or to yourself, something like, “Every day in every way things are getting better and better”, you are putting that energy into the universe and cultivating that reality. On the other hand, if you keep telling yourself that things are getting worse, or that there is no help, you aren’t helping your situation. Remember to be kind to yourself, and keep telling yourself, no matter how dark it gets, that all is well. All is well. Food/Diet/Exercise. Eating healthy and having a nice balance between rest and activity is helpful also. Take up biking, or running, or something that gets you on your feet on moving. Sunlight is great, too. I take Vitamin D everyday, and also have a sun lamp for the winter. Immerse Yourself in Good Company. Surrounding yourself with positive, wholesome, bright individuals is always refreshing. Spend time with people that you know will make you feel great, that you can have meaningful conversations with, and share ideas with. Too often I would find myself mentally exhausted after being around individuals who just drain me. Reading. Having a book or two on hand that fills you with light always puts things in perspective. It could help you let go of little, trivial every-day issues, and help you focus on what really matters. I started with “Man’s Eternal Quest” and “Autobiography of a Yogi”. Genesight. A new, exciting tool that I recently discovered. I recently had some genetic testing done, and the results of this particular report show you which medicines will work well with your genetic makeup, as well as drugs that will most likely have moderate to significant gene-drug interaction. Essentially, it informs you of which medications will work best with you, based on your genetic makeup. Now, by no means am I a master at any of these topics mentioned, I just know that they serve me in a way that makes each day a little brighter. Over the years I have learned how to handle myself in times of panic, and I will tell you that I’ve become better at managing them, but they still tear at me. We are resilient people, and can handle anything. Erase the negative stigma that people hold around medication and look at it in a more positive light. Medicine could help you establish some sense of normalcy in your life, and help you form these new habits, which could eventually have the same effect that the medicine was having, so that you no longer need any medication. But you have to do the work. You have to be willing put in the time and effort. You have to create your own path, and stick to it. It’s not easy, it’s not pleasurable, but the end result is a more peaceful life. My most recent struggle is in the form of obsessive thinking, a racing mind, and an out-of-body feeling, all the time. And as much as I want to be entirely off of medicine altogether, I admit that I still need some support. A lot of this has to do with my perception of “normal”. What does it mean to feel normal? What do I mean when I say I feel weird, or I don’t feel right? I’m trying to accept that how I feel is my new “normal”, and so now more than ever I just need to accept that, and cope with it in the best way that I know. “Let my soul smile through my heart, and my heart smile through my eyes, that I may scatter rich smiles in sad hearts.” — Paramahansa Yogananda",2017
Why I Stopped Drinking Alcohol,"This is my first ever blog post on Medium, so I figured I would start it off with a question I get on a daily basis (especially as an Irish man) “Why don’t you drink?” Before I delve into my reasons, I want to clarify that I have no problems with alcohol and this isn’t a judgemental post, a “I’m so much better than people who don’t drink” post or saying there is anything wrong with alcohol….everything in moderation right :-) It’s January 2nd 2017 and I have seen a lot of posts about “Dry January” as well as some of my friends telling me they have quit alcohol. In fact, I had two personal training sessions in a gym in Galway recently and the PT didn’t drink either. With that said, I figured it might be a timely post. “alcohol is seen very differently….it is the only drug people will question you not taking.” ~ Jason Vale, Kick the Drink… Easily! I only started drinking when I was 18 years old. I will always remember being in my leaving cert (final high school exam) year in secondary school. I was 17 at the time. Whenever there ws a long weekend or a holiday period, class mates would always ask you what you got up to. Most people talked about how they went out to the pub/club and drank. At the time I never had a drink and I never went out (I know I’m a saint/boring). When I was asked this, I always felt compelled to lie and say I was “out in the pub” because any other response wouldn’t have been as cool (at least thats what I thought). The night I turned 18, I received my leaving cert results and as I was the legal age to drink, I headed off with my friends for my first venture into the pubs. That was the first night I had a drink (a fat frog if I remember correctly). I don’t think I was drunk that night as I was soaking the expeirence in. Flash forward the college years (and introduction to the famous Buckfast — very popular in Galway) as well as travlling to South America, New Zealand and finally settling in Sydney, Australia….many a great night was had drinking with my friends. Once again, I am not dismissing drinking…..I had great nights out and for the best part I never drank excessively. Once a week at best (even in college). Funnily enough, I never really took to beer. I enjoyed a cider or a glass of wine as well as whiskey and cokes. Then (another long story I will get into on this blog eventually) I started working in Australia for my first realy full-time job in sales. My first pay cheque bounced and the company went into liquidation and administration. I decided (with no regrets even now) to continue working there for a couple of years with little or no pay. When you are getting little or no pay, you have to give up things that aren’t a priority in life — drinking alcohol turned out to be one of those things. I remember being home in Christmas 2011 and I started to think about giving up alcohol. When I got back to Australia, my friends and I went on a road trip (probably February 2012). We were in a bar one night and I remember my friend buying rounds of beer. I wasn’t drinking mine and I felt really bad for not drinking it. Here he was being nice and I was pouring them away. I didn’t have the courage to say no. Something clicked that night and I decided to give up alcohol becasue of my work situation, as well as not wanting my friends to waste their money on me and experiment with my self-esteem (or lack of). “Peer pressure is an after thought when you have self-esteem.” ~ Gary Vaynerchuk I love that quote above from Gary Vee (Gary actually owns a Wine business!). When you are playing your own game, peer pressure doesn’t matter. After I gave up alcohol, I started to attend a lot of business seminars. I wanted to see how successful people lived their life. Many of them do say to avoid alcohol. One of my favourite entrepreneurs Grant Cardone says it on a regular basis. Of course, there are many entrepreneurs that drink, it depends on who you follow and I listen to them all. I attended a business seminar in Melbourne, Australia. During the interval, they put on some music and asked five members of the audience to go up onstage to get the crowd going. Most people are nervous and self conscious, so they don’t go up. The speaker said “whatever is holding you back from doing this, is holding you back in real life.” After hearing this I raised my hand and decided I’d go up there and not worry what anyone thought of me anymore….I wanted to play my own game. In fairness, my dancing was probably terrible and I have a lot to learn. My girlfriend mentions it to me on a regular basis (“,) It felt good going up there and that really helped me during the inital phaze of giving up alcohol. The first 6 months were tough as you are very self-conscious if/when people see you without a drink in your hand. It’s amazing how there is always one person who spots this….some have x-ray vision! It’s a real test of persistence to stick to not drinking. It gives you a lot of confidence to say no and as you progress, your body language changes and people learn not to ask twice because they see a confident individual infront of them who has made their decision. I initally did this as a test to see how long I would last and almost 5 years later I am still going strong. I don’t ever see myself drinking alcohol again. I don’t miss the hangovers, I am a lot more productive and confident following the decision to stop drinking. Late nights out don’t interest me in the slighest anymore. I like getting up early and seizing the day. I left Australia in July 2014, the company I worked for at that time went out of business. I’m now happy to report that I have done well since moving to London with lots of exciting stuff around the corner. I work in sales in London and I still don’t drink……I’m told that’s a rareity but at least I stand out from the crowd :-) Once again, everything in moderation. As we get older, time is definelty our most valuable asset. If you are happy with your lifestyle, that’s awesome. If you feel you are lacking time, have money problems, self esteem issues, anxiety or just want to experiment, I think giving up alcohol and committing to it is a great way to start.

"January 1, 2017","Hi there! Welcome to my new blog. I am trying to stay away from social media and focus on myself this year. If you want to stay updated with me, this is the best way! I’ll start off by going through this last year as I have kept most of my life secret. I celebrated my one year anniversary with my boyfriend, Jack, back in May. (He will be mentioned frequently in this blog!) I also finished my final semester of college and graduated with a BFA in Theatre Design and Technology. I have always been ahead academically and was so happy to be graduating with a BFA before I turned 21. I gained a full time job 3 months before I graduated which would start that June. I was at a very high point in my life back then. After graduation, I started this job and met some pretty amazing people. I was never really great at making friends, but for some reason, I really clicked with this group. I was able to share all of these moments with Jack and my best friends from Virginia, which really brought everything together. About a month or so after starting this job, the problems started. I started having knee problems in January which made it hard to do physical activity for a long time. I severely aggravated it on the job and the steady job I had started to fail. I tried to push through it, but I knew it wasn’t right. Eventually, I got moved to a different position, one that was even harder on the knee. I became injured (cutting my finger down to the bone and needing to get stitches) because of poor working conditions, and was terminated from the position. I was broken, both mentally and physically. Many people don’t know this, but I have had severe depression and anxiety for half of my life. I was also recently diagnosed with bipolar 2 disorder. Clearly, it’s hard for me to deal with this, but it’s even harder for my family and loved ones around me. Things can change at any moment and send me in a downward spiral. When I lost this job, that is exactly what happened. My depression got worse, I never wanted to leave the house, and everything I worked so hard for had disappeared. I applied to many jobs in those next two months and became very let down when I never heard from anyone. I finally received a call for a job that would help me recover, but would also give me more information on how the other side worked in my field of study. I started the position only a few weeks later and everything seemed to be going in the right direction again. Everyone was really great in the office and so supportive of what I was trying to learn. Right after Thanksgiving, though, my world turned upside down again. My job was eliminated and I was back to where I was. I tried to hide the pain I was feeling and tried to make everything seem okay. I knew deep down it wasn’t. I know my struggles are nothing to what was going on in the world this past year, but they still killed me. The only things that were able to keep me going were Jack, my family, my friends, and of course, my photography. Oh Snap! Images was the best thing that happened to me this past year. I brought it from a self-started company for theatre to a Limited Liability Corporation. I completed 26 events, most being weddings. I strive to grow this business even more in 2017. I will be posting every day on Instagram and this blog so you can see everything through our lenses. I want to help end the negativity in the world by showing the beauty we see every day.",2017
A Pill,"So… you're here because you've been anxious, depressed and have sensed some… strange things. Isn't that it? Right. My anxiety comes from nowhere but takes over everywhere. My depression crushes any sense of self that I could ever have. My strange experiences distort my interpretation of things and turns my daily life into the bizarrest of dreams! I see… you mention dreams. Dreams should only exist while we are asleep… … If they dare to invade the realm of consciousness… there's only one thing to do. What? To make them disappear before they do it to you! I don't want to disappear, but I fear my depression convinces me otherwise, sometimes… For all that I have a pill which works in the blink of an eye! That sounds wonderful! When can I get started? Soon enough, let me just get you prescribed. Now it is done, now things will work out for you. Just go to the pharmacy and take a pill to feel renewed. Great! I'd be lost without you, Doc. You're not the only lost soul I saved, I’m just doing my job. Have the other souls find their way? Of course! Their way have always been paved. Is that so? Where it leads to? To the realm of endless certainty and unchanging truth.",2017
New,"Tonight I look at this page and it is totally empty. A moment ago it was filled with words. My husband lay next to me with his eyes closed sick with pneumonia. And then I took a deep breath and hit “delete.” My husband spends his life on the computer. It was as if my hitting the delete button stopped his heart. His eyes burst open “what did you just do?!” Haha. “its not a big deal.” I said. Many times when I write I just feel like it isn’t the direction I am supposed to go. Instead of trying to go back and edit and change, I just delete and start over. I guess I feel like it leaves more room for the Holy Spirit. So what is it that the Holy Spirit is trying to show me tonight? I sat here and stared. I had no idea what to write. It was a blank slate. “Totally empty.” I murmured to myself. But then I realized I had a chance to start new. How appropriate for the first day of the new year. It is funny. The new year means absolutely nothing to me. I see all these fun families on Facebook and Instagram celebrating with each other. If it weren’t for hubs, my kids wouldn’t even know the new year existed. It never even occurred to me to tell them. I don’t really know why I don’t get excited about it, but I think maybe it is because for so long I hoped for change and for things to be new and they never seemed to be. Anxiety always lurked, stress never faded, I never became a better wife or mom, and then it felt like hell hit me in the face when Quinlan died. Now here is the thing. I know there is hope. But I guess I am learning that it just doesn’t happen the way I always expected or wanted it to happen. People have said HORRIFIC things to us over the years. Advice about marriage, and even how we should “be over” the death of our son. But what most people don’t understand is that hope, and healing, don’t mean forgetting. I will never forget what Pastor Tim said beside Quinlan’s grave: “You will forever be marked.” And we will. But the way he said it was the most comforting thing anyone has ever said. It allowed us to hurt. It allowed us to accept that this would always be a part of us. But it didn’t leave us in a place of hopelessness. Because our Savior is marked. And yet He has made us new. So somehow in some way I have to believe that today is a new day. And in some way I will find a way to sing my Savior a new song.",2017
Redneck Reading Rainbow,"I meant it when I said I have my reasons for asking. The thing is that from around 2009, aside from academic text (books and articles), blogs and social media posts, I have probably read only one-two books per year. I was raised on books. My parents encouraged my sisters and I to read, and from childhood I was a voracious reader. I read because I actually loved reading. It was an amazing feeling to curl up in some nook at home and read. There was nothing better than to read before bedtime and awaken with a book beside me on the bed. Then anxiety slowly knocked on doors and windows. And in my mid-teens it broke down the door. In my early twenties it picked the house up and held it in the eye of the storm for years. Silence is a complex concept for me to discuss. Or maybe I’m just over-complicating it for myself. Silence has stifled me when I’ve wanted to ask for help. It’s also scared me due to the fact somehow along the way I began to associate it with being alone. Reading used to be a beautiful world of silence for me. Characters in books would come alive based on actors/actresses I would assign to play them in my head. The best kind of entertainment. Hours and hours building wonderlands. Completely at home, and feeling so safe. Every new word I encountered got added to a list that I would enthusiastically look up in our trusted Oxford Dictionary. My vocabulary thrived. And I genuinely had fun. I’ve come across one other person who has mentioned that in deep depression she was unable to read. I’m sure there are many more. During my life my family and friends have lovingly accused me of always wanting to diagnose myself. This is true. My mind loves structure. In this context finding explanations for things occasionally helps me to separate the issue from my sober self. It gives me temporary relief. Paradoxically, this also negatively feeds my OCD rituals. A theory has formed in my mind as to why I’ve struggled to read: Studying had to be done to pass grades. Leisurely reading could be abandoned because I was no longer comfortable with the silence it would take to concentrate. Something that was once effortless became extremely weighty, and at the peak of it, just too heavy to bear. My mind was on overdrive, and I needed audible distractions. This ties in with me always craving to be surrounded by people during that time. Also, with me hating the alone time in my own mind just before I fell asleep (which was not always an easy thing due to my anxiety.)And so over the years the bedtime routine of reading was overtaken by the passive ritual of watching TV series. So for the better part of a decade I have lost out on the literary scene. I have nodded and tried to convey familiarity in my eyes regarding the authors and books of the moment, when really I’ve had no clue. I have felt the deepest guilt when I’ve wanted people to read my work when I haven’t been able to bring myself to read long texts (and books of others.) I’ve felt stunted because everybody professes that to be a good writer, you need to be an avid reader. But most of all, I’ve felt an urgency knowing that the child within me is patiently waiting to reclaim what is mine. I am grateful to medium. I have engaged with everything I’ve recommended. I’ve read them. I’ve enjoyed them. They have widened my scope. And now that I am finally taking practical steps to manage my anxiety, I would like to find my way back to being a book lover. A book club may give me some accountability. But whether I join one or not, I want to dive into books again, and lose and find myself.",2017
The changing state of my Mental Health,"When I was junior high school I was diagnosed with ADD (not the much more popular ADHD.) I was tested and put on several medicines like Ritalin. Ritalin itself showed to actually make me worse, according to my teachers.) I was eventually put on something that I took until I graduated and was able to say I didn’t want it. I believed that the medicine was somehow making me less me and I wanted to be the person I was born to be, a person I liked. At this point words like, anxiety and depression were not really part of my vocabulary. I was shy and I would outgrow it. It was is simple at that. Every adult in my life had said so multiple times. As I started college I left all thoughts of ADD behind me and continued and began the grand adventure of learning. Unfortunately, I learned more about failed love than I did academically. I started wondering if maybe depression was issue. By now I knew it ran in my family and it seemed clear to me that I felt these things much more strongly then the people I knew at school. After a particularly depressing semester I dropped all of my classes and took a different path. I had always loved reading so I decided to take a creative writing class. And so I did, one class. The first day the teacher called me out and asked why I was there and I said something along the lines of what I just wrote wanting to write because I love to read. When she followed up with a question like what my favorite/last read book was, I didn’t have an immediate answer and was brushed off as someone who must not really love to read. That was my one and only day in that class. I returned to school the next semester with smaller course loads (minimum for full time) and no job and embarked on what resulted in a very successful academic life in my original chosen field of Software Engineering. It is hard for me to imagine this now but I actually earned my keep by doing one on one tutoring. I was good at this stuff, it was in my blood, and I couldn’t understand how so many people struggled with basic concepts I absorbed immediately in grade school. I’m not proud of this feeling but I definitely felt as if there were very few people in my class who could keep up with the material much less with me which reinforced things I had heard growing up about how good I was at these things. There were only a handful of standouts that seemed to be as far above me as I was above the rest. Of course all good things must end, and so,10 short years ago, I was forced to enter the “real world.” I was actually quite surprised when I found that people, much like those I had tutored and deemed helpless in college, were now lead engineers. I saw a lot of things that went against every instinct I had as a child and every thing I was taught in college and was sure I knew better. But contrary to all of the promises of the adults in my life, I had not grown out of being shy and mostly went along for the ride. Only occasionally arguing minor points with individuals on a case by case basis. As I started having my first panic attacks and regular incidents with my anxiety, including the beginnings of my telephonophobia, I became aware that I had been right about one thing in college, that I was not going to fit well in the business world. This caused me to make my first attempts to work with my doctor on the anxiety and panic attacks. In the end I found everything I tried to be unhelpful with worse side effects so I dropped it as I didn’t see it as a serious issue that affected me every day. By 2010 things had started t turn again. The telephonophobia, anxiety, and panic attacks were now a normal part of my life. But I was few jobs in and had started to find people (bosses) who understood what I was capable of and took advantage of that fact. It wasn’t long before I was lead and a go to person on several topics. My opinion had become highly regarded and there were very few meetings I wasn’t involved in. It was in this environment that I discovered Elaine N. Aron’s The Highly Sensitive Person. This book seemed to describe what I had always passed off as shyness in the most perfect way. The only pieces that didn’t fit completely were the still new and relatively infrequent panic attacks along with the continued growth of my telephonophobia. Unfortunately, the panic attacks and telephonophobia grew worse to the point where they are now a very normal part of my life. In 2015 I had to explain to the boss and my new job how my telephonophobia and other forms of anxiety will affect my work. At home it had become very rare for me to make a phone call, no matter how important or otherwise. Job changes were almost just as hard to me as ordering pizza. Thankfully, we live in a world where most food can be ordered online for delivery. I also discovered, that a perk of being married is that there was someone else who could make most of the calls for me. As 2016 came to an end I finally embraced the advice of my primary care physician. He had for sometime been telling me we he was reaching the limits of what he could do for me. I had tried and failed a dozen drugs over the last 10 years and none of them had given me any help. He felt it was time that I see a specialist. His first attempt to do this a year or two before ended badly because he left me with a name and number which I was unable to call. Regardless, in the fall of 2016 I finally did it and had my first appointment shortly after thanksgiving. He gave me my first official diagnosis which was Social Anxiety Disorder, along with a new prescription. It has been a little a little over a month but I can feel a change that I can’t describe I just feel better. More importantly, I have made half a dozen phone calls that I would have found difficult or impossible in the past with little to no internal struggle. I can’t wait to see what 2017 brings in this arena.",2017
Going to University with a Mental Disorder,"When suffering from a mental illness such as Depression, Anxiety, Bipolar and other disorders, it can be extremely nerve wracking and can wreak havoc on your self-esteem. It also increases stress levels which can often make these conditions worse. What most people do not realise is that universities have outstanding disability services that focused on taking care of any welfare and academic needs of those effected by disability. As well as a government scheme, Disability Access Route to Education (DARE), which helps students acquire a place in university via the CAO. Dublin City University (DCU) In DCU, there is a disability service that aims to provide high quality assistance for students with any disability. The service has a number of professionals working to help students with issues such as accommodation, academic support, counselling services and Assistive Technology. The service offers weekly check-ins if necessary and help with any difficulties you may have. Our aim is to promote equality of access for learners with disabilities, specific learning difficulties, mental health diffiuculties and on-going medical conditions in DCU. University College Dublin (UCD) UCD Access & Lifelong Learning support service offers drop-in sessions with various advisers ranging for disability to academic affairs. Services include counselling, assistive technology, academic support and useful online guides for various types of disability. UCD is very proud of its commitment to students with a disability. The University has a policy of equal opportunities for students with a disability and aims to create an environment which enables students to participate fully in the mainstream of University life. Trinity College Dublin (TCD) Trinity College Dublin offer a disability service aiming to provide high quality support. Support services range from academic support, exam accommodation, assistive technology, Unilink services such as counselling, occupational therapy and respite space.

Our supports will help you become independent in your learning, easing the transition from school to college and from college to career.",2017
Anxiety & Control,"To Dennis Cessan 2016 came to an end, a bitter end according to the many. People are actually afraid of what will happen next and there’s even a thing called Post Trump Stress Disorder. In general it seemed like anxiety levels rose in 2016. Without any links to prove it, I’ve seen I’ve read a lot of articles by people dealing with their anxiety and giving tips on how to handle it. Without intending to belittle anyone with Anxiety Disorder I fear that we are seeing an increase in people reading their everyday stresses as anxiety just like there suddenly were many more introverts a couple of years ago. On the other hand, maybe we are more prone to anxiety today with social media increasing social pressures causing heigtened self conciosuness, strive for perfectionism, sleep problems and possible lack of routines. I would lie if I didn’t admit that I’ve considered my own stresses to be part of a bigger anxiety, but then I always seem able to handle them in one way or another. And so, over the years I’ve added tools to handle whatever stresses I might have. I use exercise as a tool for reflection. I use writing as a tool for expression. They give me a sense of control and immediately makes me feel less stressed. A key for these tools are they I won’t let myself put pressure on these tools, like having certain exercise goals or being too pedantic with my writing. I like these areas of my life to be as easy as possible to maintain so that I don’t stop. Therefore, one day exercising can be 20 push ups and another day a full set of push ups, sit ups, kettle bells and/or running. Anything works as long as they help me stay relaxed. I have other common and simple tools as well, like tidying up the house pretty much every night. However, I seldom write to do lists or journal my life, and I mentioned that because I believe that you do? Your stress, correct me if I’m wrong, seems to be about not knowing what to do, not having something to do or not knowing if you’ve done something? Is that right, if not, what are they? What do you need to do to prevent feeling stressed, or even anxious?",2017
Defeat Depression and Anxiety By Directly getting in touch with Allah (SWT),"Happiness is a state that can be termed as a mental state in which a person is positive or feels pleasant. Every human being on this earth pursues happiness in this world. It doesn’t matter if you are a child, adult, Muslim or Non-Muslims; the pursuit of happiness is a universal goal. There are various scientific researches that categorize happiness based on specific things. An Islamic perspective to achieving happiness is simply being content with what one has in life. This simply means that if a believer has true faith in Allah (SWT) and complete trust in Him, than he is satisfied with what he or she has in life and is happy. One thing to make sure is that happiness can never be found in money and materialistic pursuits and things, rather it comes from the remembrance and faith in Allah (SWT).

#BigParentingIdea — Our Worrying Won’t Help Them. Our Belief In Them Certainly Will.,"We worry about the well being of our children. We worry about the well being of other people whom we love, but children, about them we worry the most. I always ask myself Is the fact that I worry going to help him in any way? Of course, it isn’t going to help him. If anything, it is likely to make him worried/ stressed out too if he notices that I freak out. So I calm down. Asking this question always helps me. I mean, how the fact that I am imagining all the things that might go wrong could possibly help anybody? And, if I am imagining all those terrible things, am I not sending out some kind of negative energy? Maybe if I wouldn’t have worried, things would have been OK? All those questions let me ease up. Thinking about other children and their parents helps, too. Abigail Jillian “Abby” Sunderland is an American sailor who, in 2010, attempted to become the youngest person to sail solo around the world. She was 16 years old when she started her solo circumnavigation. She failed. Before she was rescued by the French commercial fishing vessel on June 12, 2010 she had multiple major technical problems during her trip. Although her yacht Wild Eyes was unsinkable (practically speaking), although she comes from the family of sailors (being a lifelong sailors herself), although she had been preparing for her journey since age 13, although her older brother Zac was the first person under the age of 18 to sail solo around the world (having completed his trip after 13 months and 2 days at sea on July 16, 2009 at age 17), there is no way her parents didn’t worry about her. I bet they did worry a lot. But they also believed in her. They believed she would be fine and they never let the worrying side of them dominate their thinking. By doing so they sent her a clear signal “Your parents know you’ll be fine, because they know that you have what it takes”. What message would they have sent her if they had let the worry run the show? That they don’t believe she can make it without them. That she doesn’t have what it takes. That she won’t survive without them in this world. When technical problems occurred they assisted her in every way possible. And their help and the awareness that she had all the support in the world from the people closest to her meant everything to her. She wasn’t alone in it. But, when there were no major technical breakdowns she was out there on her own and she needed to know that her parents had faith in her ability to cope with day-to-day challenges. When there are no major issues our kids are out there on their own and they need to know that we have faith in their abilities to cope with day-to-day challenges. When major problems occur they should know that they’re not alone in it. That they can always count on us and that we will support them in every way possible. Our worrying will help nobody. It can only cause us (and them too) to freak out. And our children always know when we worry about them. How? We tell them. The code word for this is “overprotectiveness”. Thanks for reading!

When Counting Sheep Is Not Enough,"Christmas aside, most of us, at some point or another will suffer from sleep deprivation as a result of personal, work or financial stress. As an anxiety veteran I have earned my stripes and am a master of the 3am duvet tussle. Running a textile business I am also naturally interested in fabric not only in how it feels to the touch, but also how it actually makes us feel. When thinking about sleep, how to get more and better quality what we actually sleep we can tend to focus on environment, diet and exercise and I think it’s fair to say that fabric, beyond style and pattern can be overlooked. So, in a bid to rectify that and to go beyond the obvious stimulants, screens and smells here are my top textile tips for improving your nightly slumber. Yes, Marilyn Monroe was onto something. Sleeping ‘au naturale’ provides a wealth of health benefits. Staying cooler in bed helps to promote longer and deeper sleep meaning you are less likely to wake in the middle of the night. Not only that it helps to sustain your metabolism as well as melatonin and growth hormones that your body needs to repair itself and help fight the ageing process! If, for whatever reason you can’t go commando then choose natural breathable fibres such as cotton or bamboo that naturally wick moisture away from the skin. 2. Don’t be fooled by thread count It would be quite natural to assume that the higher the thread count of your linen the better the quality. Sadly this is not true. The ‘Sleep Doctor’ Michael J Breus explains — ‘Once you exceed 500 thread count you are looking at 2 textiles that have been woven together’. This manipulation of fabric usually involves the use of synthetic fibres so save your pennies and stick to 400 max. 3. ‘Easy-Care’ is a nightmare As Ariel Kaye — founder of Parachute Bedding informs us. ‘Wrinkle free and easy care bedding is often treated with formaldehyde resin that doesn’t wash out’. I don’t know about you but formaldehyde doesn’t feel like a comfortable bed fellow! 4. Don’t let the bed bugs bite I’m a softy so our black labrador can often be found at the end of our bed, which in itself is beneficial for me and my pal anxiety. What is not so beneficial is those little critters that like to party in our percale, so make sure to make your bed every day — in doing so you help to minimise the surface area where dust can collect — and where there is dust there is mites! Note: Along with warm drinks and baths, bed making and turning down can also form part of night time rituals that train the brain that it is time for sleep. 5. Treat your sheets like you treat your knickers I don’t mean to be glib here but it’s important. Be mindful of the detergents that you use they may unknowingly be causing unnecessary irritation between the sheets. If in doubt plump for non-bio and/or eco-friendly washing powders that are kinder on fabrics and skin. If your so inclined you can even make your own. It goes without saying that bedding needs to be washed regularly and changed completely every 2 years — less frequent that knickers (I hope)! And there it is — I hope that this helps. We spend over 1/3 of our lives in bed so let’s try and make it as comfortable as possible. Sweet (uninterrupted) Dreams.",2017
Anxiety and Dating,"Last week I wrote about anxiety and lack there of. I have learned, and some may call this morbid, that I can not count on one thing or another with myself to last too long in that department. The challenge with PTSD is it never goes away and has this intimate dance alongside of anxiety. I recently read the title of an article called “high functioning anxiety.” My response was a hmfph, I got me some of that. I don’t stop. Well, that is not true. I have taught myself to. It is of course “scheduled” down time, god forbid I just allow it, right?! One of the ways I “deal with/manage/live with” the running movie reel in my head is to do and distract. When the PTSD and anxiety is particularly bad, you can count on me to ramp things up on my to do list. It is no different than when a child is continuously going for the electrical outlet and you keep giving them a different toy to distract. I have mostly learned to manage myself in different situations. Sometimes I avoid things that I know will be challenging, but as I have said in the past, I am stubborn as hell. This stubbornness I have learned to gently embrace, because it has kept me alive. What I am not used to is managing things with people who do not know me very well, aka the title, dating. I had an instance on New Year’s that welcomed me to this new phenomenon. Again, I am stubborn, and keep doing things that have the potential to put me into a fetal position wherever I may land. Anxiety in its glory is crippling. It can show up in different strengths and variations. When you are having a full on panic attack (which by the way is defined as a sudden feeling of acute and disabling anxiety), you want to die, because it can feel like you are. It is a feeling of complete helplessness and lack of control. You can have a rapid, pounding heartbeat, dizziness, shortness of breath, shaking, temperature and or sweating dysregulation, intense fear, and this feeling of non-reality, a detachment like from it. Again, that is a panic attack, but like I said, there are varying degrees of it. I remember a couple of years ago, I was driving Raffi and I somewhere, and I had a lot of the symptoms above alongside chest pain (that can also be a symptom). The chest pain wrapped from my left chest to my left shoulder blade. You see, I am an acupuncturist, we have to take a lot of medical courses in our training. If a patient walked in with that symptom, I would be calling 911. I called my sister. Told her most likely this was a panic attack, no, I do not know the why, but in case I do drop dead of a heart attack, we will then know it wasn’t a panic attack. It was. Many an emergency room have people coming and going thinking they are having a heart attack but instead it is a panic attack. This sounds like fun? Sarcasm is deeply implied. Severe anxiety causes people to lose jobs, quit school, get divorced, and not want to leave the house to name a few things. There are times I don’t want to leave the house, it is rare though, mostly because Raffi needs me, my patients need me, and I mostly can push through, as uncomfortable as it is. But there have been times where that crippling effect has happened, and it scares the crap out of me. I have had friends and loved ones witness this, and luckily they know me, my history, and know to just be the ground that I need as I feel like I am falling apart. Sometimes there is a “trigger” (PTSD), sometimes it happens when I am exhausted, over-stimulated, in a crowd, hungry. Sometimes I just don’t know. I feel like I am lucky, it is not my whole existence. I know there are some people this is awake to asleep. Let’s get back to New Years. I had the privilege to see Brandi Carlisle in concert with the person I am seeing. It was a double bonus for me, she is one of my favorite artists, and I got to ring in the new years with someone special, which is the first time since Jess and Bells died (aside from my friends the past two years, which counts, but this is different). I have talked with him when we have gone and been places that I think may trigger me, tried to explain, but unless you are experiencing it, it is one of those things that is hard to describe the intensity and reality. The concert was in a place in Portland called the Crystal Ballroom, we got in fast thanks to him, and headed toward the front, I nestled us on the side, not deep in the crowd (as safe as I could make myself in a crowd that big). I could feel my heart beating a bit faster, and of course tried to ignore it. As people started really piling in, I felt trapped, yet refused to move as we were toward the front, with a great view point. The opening act came on, and it was so loud, the people around me were talking even louder (it seemed), I felt my world crashing in as that increasing heart beat then doubled. I took the anxiety medicine I always carry with me hoping for a fast response. He of course looked at me with concern, and I just said this is super intense for me. The thing with anxiety is when you are having it severely, you can’t tell someone what to do or how to fix it, because you are doing everything in your power not to end up in that fetal position on the floor. And often, you can’t “fix” it. It sometimes passes, and sometimes you need to remove yourself from the situation. I don’t take that medication very often, and luckily it works. You just get into a place where the surrounding intensity doesn’t matter anymore. But it takes a bit of time to kick in. I look at this from both points of view, as I often do with most everything. For me, I am having an anxiety attack, feel helpless, and just need to try my best to breathe until the meds kick in, and not embarrassingly end up on the floor crying. I cannot even imagine what it may be like for someone unfamiliar with dealing with someone like that, how helpless it must be for them. He suggested we leave, I said no fucking way. I was trying to communicate what my body was experiencing, what I was feeling. There was a pause, him not knowing what to do, me in a state of just being able to get out of my mouth that it would pass. I felt like he was annoyed, I can pretty much guarantee he was not. It is just the way I inferred it. I am a fixer. It makes me good at my job. When someone tells me that they have a problem, I go into that mode. I get it, if you see someone who is having a reaction to being somewhere, the logical solution is to get them out of there. I think there was a moment or two where we both stiffened in reaction to this. He asked me if I was ok. I said I was getting there. There are lists you can look up of things not to say to people who are having an anxiety attack, I will not bore you with it. I have to be honest, I was annoyed. I was annoyed that he would suggest we just leave (which I get after the fact, but I am talking about in that moment). I was annoyed mostly with myself, because I hate feeling helpless, I hate how this tries to dictate what I can and can’t do, I hate how it makes me feel. And then I feel guilt, because I feel bad for the people I am with. I used to be a person that took a long time to recover from things, Jesse and Bella dying fixed that mostly. I process much faster now. It is just not worth holding onto insignificant things. After a few breaths, the meds kicking in, and a gathering of thoughts, I shared. Those who know me, I share. A lot. If I am quiet too long, my friends text and say, hey, are you ok? I made a pact after they died, not to hole up within myself and let the grief/depression/anxiety/PTSD take me down, because I know it will. I know if I keep all the feelings I feel inside, they will consume me faster than a fire that has been burning for hours does with a new log. I shared with him that I was having an anxiety attack, that I was trying to communicate with him how it was affecting me, that I just needed him to hear that, not fix it, that if I needed to leave, I would have said so. Also, that I refuse to stop living life and doing things I want because of this. I also shared, and thank you Brene Brown, that I was being completely vulnerable by sharing any of it and how scary that was for me. Let me repeat that dear readers. It is scary for most people to be honest, say your truth, and be vulnerable. It is so scary for someone, and I only have my point of reference, who has severe PTSD and anxiety to show someone that side and try to walk them through it. I am always waiting for the person to run. Say, this is not worth it, it is too much. I cannot even put into words the fear around it. That goes from meeting someone and trying to figure out how to tell them what happened (and them having that reaction) to the everyday stuff that I deal with. I generally don’t tell new people the extent of what is happening in my brain or body because of it. But I am trying to change that for a number of reasons. One, how can they get to know me, like really know, me unless I do, it is sorta dishonest if I don’t. How can they learn to support me if I just keep it bottled inside? And most importantly, that is not honoring myself or my process. Obviously I am not going to go walking through the streets and say, hey, that loud truck just completely freaked me out and sent me into a flight or fight thing in my body. But I can tell the person walking next to me who cares about me. The rest of the evening was amazing. She is something to see if you get a chance. There is a song called Evangeline that she sings about her daughter. When I saw her in Bend this past August, I cried all the way through thinking of my sweet Bells, this was no different. He pulled me close, held me. That. I cannot even say what that meant. For reals. Then, when midnight came, there were balloons released. I had seen them earlier and said cool. Well, it was cool until they started randomly popping. I don’t do fourth of July. And apparently I don’t do balloons popping. It sounds like gun shots. It does things to my imagination and brain on unconscious and conscious levels. It’s not good. Luckily, the meds were still on board. So instead of the full blown thing that would have happened, it was just jarring. And I just jumped each time. Which was a lot. Again, no words spoken between us, I don’t know the extent of what he knows about the details of what happened or what goes through my brain. But he held my hand tight. Which was all I needed. I am in un-chartered territory and learning daily. It is not that I have not dated since Jess and Bells died, but this may be the first time I am letting someone in more than I have in the past. I am dancing with the fear around it, acknowledging it, and working on walking through it, leaving it behind, knowing full well that it will fight to stay in the forefront. I am working on the balance of natural discovery between two people, and not ignoring that I have had this severe trauma that affects me on a daily basis. I love experiencing new things and places, and love it even more when I get to share it with others. The reason I started dating, was I missed that special someone to share stuff with. I am continuing to do all the things to help counterbalance the reactions my mind and body have to this trauma. I have to. I have to for my daughter, and I need to for me. Amongst all the stupid shitty and terrible things happening in the world, there is beauty, there is wonder, and there are amazing people and places to experience.

Simple and clear please,"Accessible and straightforward articles and advice on anxiety can help reduce the feelings of isolation and hopelessness of individuals often frustrated by overly complex and inaccessible approaches to overcoming mental distress. Essentially, addressing distressing levels of anxiety can often be achieved through equipping oneself with controlled approaches for managing worry & rumination, and developing resilience through self awareness and organising and implementing a positive lifestyle based on simple and mindful approaches to planning, doing and resting. However, it’s important to acknowledge that different things work for different people, so be open and honest and talk to your General Practice (GP). Professional support might be appropriate. www.nhs.uk There is no absolute cure as anxiety is a natural reaction but there are proven simple, straightforward, yet not necessarily easily implemented ways of managing anxiety. Anxiety is a natural, normal reaction but can become problematic if it’s too easily triggered, deep rooted and impacting your daily functioning in a detrimental way. Approaches to overcoming these difficulties can be split into three groups: physical (relaxation), cognitive (challenging thoughts) and behavioural (graded hierarchies). Through insight into why anxiety is becoming a problem you can begin developing an ability to adapt and challenge unhelpful thinking errors. Whilst acknowledging it is a gradual process, hope in a calmer future can be cultivated in the understanding our brain is capable of adapting and that there is no fixed mental state. The brain learns to behave in certain ways, which means it can relearn healthier more resilience ways of managing anxiety. Generic and environmental factors play a part in an individuals vulnerability to developing a struggle with anxiety. Through looking at how what we think and do impacts on upon how we feel through Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT), evidence proves we can change our thinking styles. Neuroscentific research evidence also confirms we can change the physical structure of the brain through exercise and mindfulness. Treatment typically involves talking therapies, such as psychotherapy or CBT, and in more severe cases medication. Evidence-based psychological interventions recommended by the National Institute of Clinical Governance (NICE) include low-intensity interventions incorporating self-help approaches and high-intensity psychological therapies. Most likely you will be advised to try psychological treatment before being prescribed medication by your GP but it depends on individual cases. Recommendations on pharmacological therapies for anxiety disorders are also evidenced in NICE guidance. Not everyone is prescribed antidepressant medication who has an anxiety disorder but for some it can be helpful. They are not regarded as a cure but a component of treatment and can have multiple benefits dependent on how different symptoms interact. Essentially they can restore chemical imbalance and help and therefore improve your receptiveness and resilience in developing healthier thinking/coping methods. These chemicals are known as neurotransmitters and work to pass signals within the brain to nerve cells. When suffering from anxiety and depression it is thought that they are unbalanced. If medication has been suggested and you are unsure of whether or not to go down that path, this is an excellent article. medium.com When anxious we are essentially perceiving a threat or danger triggering a change in thoughts, feelings, sensations and behaviour. CBT is an approach which looks at developing insight into our very individual and possibly unhelpful thoughts, assumptions and resulting behaviours, and then looking at enacting change. The aim is to help change the way we think about a situation therefore determining how we feel about it and essentially helping us respond in more resilient, balanced and positive (calm) manner. The approach works by breaking down overwhelming thoughts and problems into smaller parts. www.getselfhelp.co.uk Make sense of your experience by developing insight about yourself as a person. Is your way of thinking about self and others affected by early life experience? Are you being overly reactive? Negative? Narrow minded? Look for alternative ways of thinking, share with friends and family and cut yourself some slack. Self-help reading and diary keeping can improve wellbeing bringing insight and empowerment. Your negative thoughts play a key role in your mental health. Resilience relies on your ability to control it. RECOGNISE troubling thoughts and stress becoming a RUMINATION. Ruminating and fixating on unwelcome thoughts and feelings about oneself, others and experiences creates tunnel vision, looking for evidence to fit in with these beliefs. Unhelpful behaviours of avoidance, escape, hyper-vigilance and worry can offer short term relief and are easy and often instinctive ways of handling areas of life you struggle with. But it also explains the very reason problems persist, get worse and make people feel as if they are stuck. These behaviours are not progressive in nature and work to maintain the problem. Recognise this, and approach things in a more positive and rounded way by putting energy into generating positive solutions to issues or alternatives to identified thinking errors. Develop resilience through organising and implementing a positive lifestyle. From immersing yourself in activity to the quality of your sleep, diet and ability to relax, it is our daily habits that have the most effect on wellbeing. To overcome anxiety is not to withdraw but to engage. Thinking outwardly, doing simple and absorbing activities take you away from thinking inwardly helping you forget worries and boost mood. Invest time in being outside and stimulate your senses by noticing what is around you. Sounds simple, but when anxious we often end up avoiding situations and feelings instinctively, creating a viscious cycle of increased worry and making things even harder to face in the future. We therefore need to overcome this to help reduce anxiety. Practice thought challenging and relaxation along the way, go at your own pace to feel a sense of control. Using a graded hierarchy approach involves splitting the task of ‘doing’ into small steps, starting with the least feared step first. Developing ways of relaxing through bringing yourself into the moment through focusing on your senses and controlled breathing (Mindfulness) is an essential first step in anxiety management. Rather then just being a reactionary response, try to develop your ability to be calm. Appreciate the importance of sometimes just doing nothing. But do it well so you can be calm in a frantic, attention grabbing society. Learn to switch off, relax and control attention by not getting drawn into doing. Schedule “do nothing” time, like you’d schedule tasks. We shouldn’t think of relaxation and retreat as something we do occasionally. Value importance of sleep but also accept worrying about not getting enough sleep is counter-intuitive. Observe these feeling and don’t fight, just let them be.",2017

Anxiety disorders overview,"www.nice.org.uk Generalised anxiety disorder involves excessive worry often resulting in feeling tense, irritable, frustrated, restless, tired and struggle with concentration and sleep. Behaviours may include avoidance, compulsive checking, reassurance seeking, trying to be in control. For a diagnosis, symptoms should be present for at least 6 months and should cause clinically significant distress or impairment in functioning. Thoughts may include ‘What if…, I can’t control worry, jumping to assumptions.’ Panic disorders involve recurring, unforeseen, rapidly onset panic attacks followed by persistent worry. More than 2 unexpected panic attacks are necessary for diagnosis. Results in avoidance, safety behaviours and feelings of imminent catastrophe. Obsessive–compulsive disorder involves recurring, persistent intrusive thoughts and obsessions, resulting in rigid thoughts and compulsions in the form of repetitive behaviours that an individual feels driven to perform. Post-traumatic stress disorder involves persistent symptoms of hypervigilance, re-experiencing, low mood and avoidance due to one or more traumatic event they have struggled to process and therefore impacts on their daily functioning. Social anxiety disorder is out of proportion and persistent anxiety towards social situations. Involves a pre-occupation of what others think, misinterpretation of behaviours, negative self appraisal resulting in avoidance and use of safety behaviours.",2017
You Are Going to Be a Giant,"I can feel it in my bones. Those words echo in my mind. That is my expectation. #HistoryOrNothing. Greatness in the eyes of the public. Fulfilment? Validation? “You are going to be a giant,” he says. “You will be lifted among the clouds,” she says. Tears are my response. Not out of sadness or fear, but from the overwhelming feeling that the universe is listening. The universe is listening and acting. The universe is bending. My universe. My world. My reality.

Framing anxiety for what it is,"Anxiety is the body’s way of responding to perceived danger. At this point adrenaline is rushed into our bloodstream to help us run away (flight) or fight. It can be positive in terms of keeping us focused, alert and can work to get the best out of us. It can be distressing and can happen when the danger is real or not, due to our individual interpretations developed from past experiences and assumptions. It can become problematic if it’s too easily triggered, deep rooted and impacting our daily functioning in a detrimental way. Instinctive ways of coping are avoidance and rumination which make the situation worse. www.theguardian.com Approaches to overcoming these difficulties can be split into three groups: physical (relaxation), cognitive (challenging thoughts) and behavioural (graded hierarchies) used to gradually build up tolerance to uncertainty and worry rather then strengthen unnecessary anxiety through avoidance. www.getselfhelp.co.uk",2017
Line Dancing,"I’m currently doing the samba on the line between clinically depressed and crisis mode While the samba may not seem somber enough to describe the tightrope I dance, it is a terrible tango for one. Table for one, terror for one, tension, suspension, anxiety for one Metaphors to describe the line between clinical and crisis are as follows: -A slow melt into the pavement, like an ice cream cone dropped on cement in the Florida heat -An atom bomb exploded with destruction in it’s wake, everything, every pain still existing but altered -Falling through the ice of a frozen lake and being trapped underneath, seeing through the ice to other side but drowning anyways -Sleep paralysis The line isn’t clear and that’s a part of the fear but if I write enough metaphors for the darkness that calls maybe some one else will answer the phone and I won’t be continually caught on the line The line that I samba between clinically depressed and crisis mode It is a crisis of losing oneself in not loving oneself in loving everyone more than myself in a self destructive manner of zero self And this is a selfish place in a selfish world where no one sees and everyone takes and a line has to be drawn somewhere between self and selfish and that line I will samba between clinically depressed and crisis mode the mean, median, and mode of this current darkness, this current dance in my chest and brain is more than a game of averages it is a Game of Thrones of who will win the war, the battle between my ears and the deep seated fears, turning all the gears, creating a rhythm and a rhyme that can’t be denied -the line to samba between clinically depressed and crisis mode -",2017

Telephonophobia,"In The Changing State of My Mental Health, I mentioned telephonophobia several times. Of all of my troubles, this one issue has had the biggest influence on my home life. What is most strange about this issue is how it came out of nowhere. When I was junior high and high school I could spend hours talking on the phone to my friends. I never met the first girl who told be she loved me, we met in a Yahoo Chat room in 1999 and became attached. We talked on the phone every day and I racked up quite the long distance bill in the process. Her ultimate rejection was a big factor in the depression that ruled my early years in college. Despite that there were other girls after that who I would spend countless hours on the phone with. I remember this continuing until at least 2005. What changed I still don’t know. At first I just was on the phone less. Then before I knew it I had begun to “fear” it. I use the word fear but I’ve never felt it fits. I have been afraid but never of the phone. Fear is an emotion that I understand well. What I experience is a physical sensation that cannot be described that makes it difficult to do anything at all.",2017
Struggle,"I will never forget however hard I try. I was 17 when it all fell down. I colapsed in the hallway one night and it began. I was indestructible before this. I did many bad things and did a good amount of drugs. For two long terrifying weeks I went through a metamorphosis of hell. I couldn't eat, sleep and I couldn't stop crying a constant sense of dread and panic consumed me. I threw up, rashes broke out on my body, I would sweat and have chills, it was a joke. I was already a skinny teen and that made things even harder, for the lack of appetite put me in an even scarier point. I just remember being very scared when I would weigh myself and see 119 or 116. I felt like I was dying. The doctors diagnosed me with an Anxiety disorder and IBS. I always felt there was something more. I simply couldn't eat. Days went by and I couldn't force anything down. I remember my mother while crying said, “what can I do we might have to take you to the hospital to feed you”. An image flashed in my mind of my stepfather who had cancer was fed by tubing with some type of white liquid pumping into him. I felt even sicker at the thought of it. I felt so alone and nothing made it go away. I wish I could remember more but I remember a little that even sex was not even in my mind, which scared me too. We were like rabbits my girlfriend and I. It was embarrassing that I was such a mess. She tried her best though and those dam SSRi’s didn't help either. We were young and i'm surprised she didn't leave me. Mabey she saw it as a positive cause she was anti-drug and alcohol. Seeing me leave that lifestyle I think made her happy. She used to joke that she put a curse on me to stop all of it. I thank you dear friend for being there. Over the next week I continued my journey through darkness and came through the worst of it, however, I was still very ill and much changed. I ate little, yet managed to eat enough. I had been put on SSRI’s and anti ulcer meds. The drugs actually made my symptoms worse, which i had been told was normal, yet they put me down hard. All of that was happening changed my whole life, which depressed me so much at the time. I couldn't smoke a cigarette, smoke weed, or drink or any other of the things I enjoyed doing at that time, because all of it gave me a panic attack. This affected my social life too, all my friends I couldn't hang with anylonger because I was to afraid to be around them. I became a shadow. I was homeschooled at the time just the last part of my senior year (long story), and wasn't interacting socially. I simply disappeared. I heard some people say I had a heart attack and died. When bad things happen to you, nobody cares and they just guess and gossip. I remember I had a friend in grade who disappeared and years later I would see him every so often at the market or some other place in town. He looked more depressed and didn't say hi, I remember he was so energetic when we were kids. I later found out he had a brain tumor, the guy prob went through hell and what people were saying about him were lies and shit. I knew how he felt now and wanted to shake his hand and say I'm sorry what they said about you. I turned 18 June 2004 a new man bare and exposed no armor, naked and beaten up. I died and was re born. Looking back now and I knew it then too I was saved. I was never really religious, but it felt like what I went through was meant to happen. I shed all that was bad in my life. If I continued like I was, I could have gone down a very bad path. I remember still today the absolute agony of those 2–3 weeks, but in one way it made me stronger. I think when you go through hell, you get to know hell, I think it's important to suffer cause no matter what we are going to encounter suffering, and better sooner than later. It humbled me to the core. I had a new life ahead of me and was ready to meet it whatever the challenge.",2017

On being the Truth,"24 hours later I do feel much better. Calmer. Peace does come back. I am living proof that is always does. I have experienced throughout my life that one of the best ways to get over yourself and your own fears and pain is to get busy: physical tasks, work, helping others out, the later is my favorite. I really enjoy being useful. Yesterday I decided to take my family out. My cousin and her friend are visiting from Costa Rica, and my nieces and nephew had not gone out much during the Christmas holiday. So….I put them all in the car and we went on a road trip to visit two of our loveliest Colonial style towns near the city, Valle de Angeles(Valley of the Angels) and Santa Lucia. Both are to this date cobble stone streets with antique buildings and houses that inspire artists and visitors from around the world. We left a bit late, 4pmish and came back 6 hours later. I focused on being a happy tour guide, towards the end of the evening we had pupusas and an anafre at a quaint garden restaurant filled to the brim with plants and flowers, and later stopped over at a lake and had hot drinks. Everyone had a great time, I totally relaxed and everyone came back tired, ready for bed. I had a really good sleep as well. And then I woke up to this beautiful silence. A quiet mind. A Tranquil mind. When this happens, I am so grateful. It is so easy to take for granted the quiet mind. Because in this zen place, one does not think so one does not worry. With anxiety it is such a different story. Anxiety really has you running around at 1,000 miles per hour. Thoughts run in and out at such speed you can’t really process each one and it really leaves me exhausted and confused. And these thoughts are mostly negative, hateful self-talk. The overall message of anxiety is: “You are incompetent. You are not good enough. Look at you: You are awful! You suck! You’ll never ‘make it’. Everyone else is okay, except you.” A pile of lies. I know that if I had someone in front of me, full of fears, anxiety and pain, I would tell them what I don’t tell myself when I am in that negative space: “Darling, you are MORE than good enough. You are already a success. You have nothing to prove anybody else because you are already wonderful. We all make mistakes. We are all forgiven for all our mistakes, we are allowed to make mistakes. Go ahead, give yourself permission to make mistakes. Because in the process of making them, and looking at them, you get to grow. And that is the gift. Each mistakes provides us a lesson. If we choose to see the lesson, it is nothing but a huge gift. The human experience is drenched in mistakes and learning from them. Each and every time. There is no maximum number of mistakes you are entitled to make before you are considered a full blown loser.” I know with all my heart that when the truth is rushing out of me as a healing balm unto another person, I am speaking the absolute truth. The truth has a wonderful way of making us feel more alive. It’s power resonates with such strength, the truth awakens the parts of you that have been asleep. It shakes your core. It makes you so alert you have to get up and do this living, this breathing in and out again, and this time with peace and real joy of being. So go on, experience the truth, be the truth. Here I am today, again, alert, awake. I want to see my truth. I don’t want to live inside the lies my head concocts. It is easy to forget all of this when we are in that moment of crisis, but we have to keep opening up to take on our truthfulness: We are already a success. We are already good enough. We are given the space to redo things and reinvent ourselves every day. There are no limits. Here comes another day. Go ahead, do it again. http://walkingongrace.blogspot.com/2017/01/24-hours-later-i-do-feel-much-better.html",2017
"Word Therapy, Session 2","It’s been three days since the beginning of my resolution and so far so good. To be honest, kind of a relief at times. I no longer have alcohol as an outlet for forcing myself to go and be social at an event. And bars no longer seem like a good but probably no-so-good after-work activity. Since my last entry, I decided to take my last few days of debauchy in stride. Unlike many resolutioners who think “Oh man, only two days left until I give up cake, Imma eat ALL the cake!” I’ve been using the time to reflect more and think about what exactly it is I enjoy about drinking and why I have never really learned how to drink “properly.” In college, there was no such thing as a limit and I was free to get as fucked up as I wanted since everyone else was more or less in the same boat. And while in the Peace Corps, many of us drank like our lives depended on it, since we had no idea when our next fix would be. Granted, it was the same with good food and hot showers where I was stationed. I had a much easier time learning how to eat more responsibly when I got back from there. There’s a dark time between returning from Peace Corps and to where I currently am that I don’t want to delve into right now. All I can say is that while going through the reverse culture shock, the depression of early COS, and the undiagnosed PTSD, I definitely used alcohol as my coping mechanism. I don’t remember a lot of that period but the results are certainly there: the gain of 50 pounds, the loss of some very close friends, and now the conditioning of getting plastered whenever I have strong emotions, a habit that I have created for myself and am now subsequently trying to break. I’ve analysed this period of my life many times and there will certainly be a post about it at some point, but right now I have a different point to make so bear with me. So, here I am with less than a week left of having alcohol as an option in my life. I decided to go ahead and experience one more happy hour after work. Typically I hate going to bars alone. I’m a very shy person and I used to be a bartender so the last thing I want to do is desperately cling for his ear while I down my drink. But in the name of learning, I decided to go alone in order to understand what exactly pulls me towards a bar after a long day at work. What is it that when a co-worker suggests “happy hour” I jump up, ready to end the work day and get my drink on? Certainly not the company of my coworkers. I don’t like most of them. So, off of the metro and into a bar that is on the way to my dog’s daycare. I had arrived at the bar around 5:00 and Dog needed to be picked up by 9 pm. Plenty of time! I was feeling pretty okay at the bar. Well, I was feeling just pretty okay that day so I’m sure my impression of the bar reflected that. The bartender took a good while to get to my drink order which I used as an opportunity to really think about what was enjoyable about a bar. The people next to me were all high-pitched and catty. There was a pair of nurses in the corner but they seemed ticked off with the world. Then there was a youngish gal sitting next to me, finishing off her happy hour dinner. I guess I technically wasn’t alone, but for me co-existing in the smallish vicinity of a bar with strangers is stressful. I don’t know where to look (I kept staring at the bottles against the bar wall) and I don’t know where to listen (the various patrons, the music, the bartender, the orders being called in the back, or one of the many conversations being held by the diners). I ended up playing a game on my phone and downing my first drink way too quickly. I always like to think that I’m handling uncomfortable situations well, but seeing as how I downed that beer in five gulps, I was obviously already emotion-drinking. The next beer came and with it so did my dissolve into comfort. That’s my biggest problem with alcohol. It is 100% my social lubricant. Most people make me unfomortable. Or annoyed. With beer I can feel my prickles begin to soften and my willingness to interact with the human race increases expenentially. Somewhere between beer 2 and 3, I began talking to pissed-off nurses. It was actually a really great conversation. We talked about their extremely difficult jobs (I have no idea how they do it) and somehow settled on discussing one of the nurses’ unhappy engagement to an ungrateful man with 5 ill-behaved children. It got intense and I hope she made the right decision though I’ve tended to find that what people say while drunk is typically the exact opposite that they would do sober. After they left, I was feeling good. Like, “it’s only 7:30 so I might as well have one more for the road” good. I struck up a conversation with a lady next to me as I sipped on my fourth. She told me about how she and a group of her friends travel the world together. I sloppily gave her my number to join in her next set of adventures. Discussions of my service came up, along with favorite types of wine. Then I woke up in my bed the next morning with a pounding hangover and a fear of dread. I had completely blacked out. I sprung out of bed and looked around for Dog. She was in her bed in the corner. I sighed with relief. I couldn’t remember picking her up. The next step was one I am all too familiar with. I looked around my room for my keys, my wallet and my phone. Wallet was in my jacket pocket. Good. Keys were hanging on the banister. Excellent. And my phone had been dropped on the floor. On my phone was a text from the lady at the bar. She asked if I had gotten home okay. I wrote some gibberish and then she asked again if I was okay. I wrote a thank you text then deleted her number. I’ll never hear from her again. I never do. I laid back into bed, flabberghasted. What the fuck happened? I wasn’t being belligerant or downing them. I hadn’t taken any shots. There is nothing worse than waking up and not remembering what had happened the night before, especially with me because it usually reults in the loss of a friend or a need to apologize to someone. I hate not knowing, having to ask people and look for clues. I hate that feeling of waking up an just knowing you did something stupid the night before. And worst off, I hate how overwhelming my anxiety is for the next 24 hours. With my crumpled up brain it took a few hours but I managed to piece together the rest of the evening. According to my card, I had bought a fifth drink, the one that definitely put me over the edge. I had apparently walked wiht the lady all the way to Dog’s daycare, where we parted ways. No clue what I said to the daycare staff and going there today was nerve-wracking for me (what if I said something offensive or did something stupid? What if I just blethered on and they wanted to go home? Do I need to apologize to someone?). According to the receipt, I got there at 8:44 pm, precisely 16 minutes before closing. That is a classic asshole move. Then Dog and I somehow made it home. I didn’t eat that night. So the next morning, I woke up feeling broken to bits. Thankfully it was my day off right before a long weekend, so I was able to nurse my hangover and broken ego with the comfort of knowing that a four-day weekend was on the horizon. But still, I completely blacked out. And it wasn’t a night of binge drinking or a crazy party that caused this. It was 5 beers over the course of 4.5 hours. Granted, I definitely drank the first one way too fast. And I should have eaten. And drunk water. But it’s still very unnerving to realize that I can black out that easily. I felt vulnerable and guilty. I don’t want to feel that way again. There are a lot of ways I no longer want to feel. I belive my alcohol abstinence will help with at least half of those not-so-great feelings but that’s just a guesstimate. I still had a few nights of drinking between then and NYE. Nothing as terrible happened again, but I had also decided to only drink at my mom’s house while visiting for the holidays. That experince did help me strengthen my resolve, though. So at least there’s that…",2017
On fearing the good things,"A few common fears reside in everyone’s psyche: death, public speaking, freak accidents. We fear the things out of our control, the things the universe will hurl at us with full force when we least suspect it. My depression and anxiety love playing a game with this concept. Instead of fearing the bad things, my mind starts to wonder how long the good things will last. I imagine myself in so many situations. Sprawled on the beach with the sun’s rays warming my skin as I let my guard down. I’ll get a phone call; someone has been hurt, someone close to me is gone. Other times I think of career-related scenarios. If I brag (read: celebrate) too much about a byline, my editor will suddenly email me and say “sorry, this story is awful, we are deleting it forever from the Internet archive, next time don’t celebrate your accomplishments.” I know by now that these thoughts are illogical at best and ludicrous at worst. I’ve taken them apart before. Why should I be so afraid of the good? Afraid of steeping myself in positivity, of celebrating my accomplishments? We want control, the thing we never get in life. We are born into uncertainty. Over time we learn to organize, to plan our days—and even our lives—ahead of time. But no amount of planning could really protect us from the unexpected. We write down appointments that never happen, goals that don’t get completed. We make a note to call someone tomorrow, but they’re not there the next day. When life makes a crack in our happiness, we wonder how we can be better prepared next time. We keep our guard up. We get suspicious. We learn to love more slowly. But constantly waiting for bad things to happen doesn’t help. It robs you of the present. It makes you hurt twice. There’s a Spanish song I like called “Llorar Es Una Locura” which roughly translates to “crying is an insane thing.” In it, Fanny Lu sings “live how you want / what is going to come will have to come / enjoy it your way / everything will happen when it has to happen.” I take these lyrics to heart. “What is going to come will have to come.” The good things—and the bad ones, too. I’ll take what I can control—call the people I love, light candles at night, write to-do lists. Slowly, I chip away at the fear that good things will only get taken away from me. It’s no way to live. “Laugh when you need to laugh / crying is an insane thing.”",2017
“An Antidote to the Age of Anxiety: Alan Watts on Happiness and How to Live with Presence”,"Since what we know of the future is made up of purely abstract and logical elements — inferences, guesses, deductions — it cannot be eaten, felt, smelled, seen, heard, or otherwise enjoyed. To pursue it is to pursue a constantly retreating phantom, and the faster you chase it, the faster it runs ahead.” www.brainpickings.org Mmmm. accidents will happen. We forget that when we convince ourselves that if we could just do X, Y, Z then the good things we want would happen. Related: “Hey America, do accidents happen anymore?

The Selves We Guard.,"Before I get into it, here’s a way to start the year happy: get the first-ever, limited edition Beautiful Voyager t-shirt while supporting the kickass nonprofit Girls Write Now. More on that below, but first… Like neurotics before me, I take delight in private rituals. The cycle of garbage removal has always been a favorite weekly rhythm. What was once chaos is now calm. Renewal and possibility live in the wake of those rumbling trucks. A strange thing about being married with a kid is having the outsiders I live with see my every compulsion. They witness my deep need for the cans to go out like clockwork on Sunday night. Even worse, they question why. Having to speak openly about my personal quirks is extremely hard. I don’t savor exposure. Do I need to change? When it comes to compulsions, it can be hard to define where they end and I begin. Mental struggles lack the clarity of physical ailments. Born with a club foot that impairs your ability to walk? There are surgeries. It’s just not how personalities work, alas. These days, my goal is balance. I use litmus test questions to check in and see how I’m doing. You can, too. This super-soft tri-blend t-shirt is being produced by Cotton Bureau. The way it works: My husband, designer friend, and I created the design. Cotton Bureau makes and mails the shirts. We split the profits with them. Everything we earn benefits the non-profit Girls Write Now. If we sell 100 shirts, we raise $800 for this org. That’s my dream! We can do it. Let’s kick 2017 off in a happy way. Here’s where you go to buy the shirt. Originally published in the Beautiful Voyager newsletter on Jan 3, 2017. Join in on Facebook, Slack, Discourse, or anywhere else fine communities appear.",2017
Trivialities of Life #DRG17,"Scrolling through my news feed, I realize how trivial this panic attack is. I am sitting in the comfort of my bed, in a nice apartment in DC worrying over a future?! One news article on Syria later, I thank my stars for the existence of this future to worry about at all. I could not be more grateful for the life I have been given and lead. We tend to get so caught up in our own trivialities that we forget to appreciate the things we have and the things around us. Ranjit gives us this opportunity to be thankful and appreciate all that is and for that I am grateful. For making me realize the importance and value of what I may take for granted.",2017

#BigParentingIdea — Pressure And Anxiety Will Help Nobody,"Those who won’t do that, who don’t know the answer by the time they celebrate their 18th birthday with their friends and family, we start to worry about those misfits. Didn’t we tell them how important it is in life that they pick something in their late teenage years? Didn’t we tell them how fierce the competition today is? Didn’t we mention all the problems that will arise in their lives should they miss the boat? Weren’t we articulate enough when we warned them about life (that life is harsh and it will only get worse)? Didn’t we do everything we could in order to pass our anxiety down to them? Damn it! Why the hell don’t they listen to us? Don’t they realize how important it is in life that you climb the career ladder at the same pace as everybody else from your class of 2012 (just as they used to in school, going in unison from one grade to the next)? How those who will miss that boat now will never amount to anything in life? How your school and college years are responsible for the quality of your life and thus how it’s the most important time period in everyone’s life? Most people would say that the optimal time or their final opportunity to choose their path in life is when they’re are in their late teenage years (early 20s — last call). I say BULLSHIT! The less pressure we will exert on those young people the better they will fare in their lives/ the greater the chance that they will be really happy in their lives (with the choices they’ll make).

Every Time I Leave Our Apartment…,"I leave the door unlocked and burglars steal our stuff, even though I tried the knob 3 times and it didn’t budge. I leave the oven on and burn our home down, even though I haven’t used it in 2 months for this very reason. I leave the refrigerator door wide open and spoil our food, even though I haven’t been in there today. Why would I go in there? I don’t have food in our apartment. I forget to empty the dryer’s lint filter and start another fire that helps the oven fire burn our unit down, even though I know I haven’t put any clothes in. I leave the shower running with the curtain drawn and flood our bathroom, along with the bathroom of the tenants below, even though I didn’t shower today. (Maybe this flood will put the fire out…) But when I return… Our home has been rebuilt and the door is locked. It doesn’t smell like the stove fire or the lint fire. Our belongings have been replaced exactly as we had them. The refrigerator is closed and restocked with fresh food, albeit none is mine. The shower has been turned off and the curtain closed. The bathroom of the tenants below has been repaired as well. I went down and asked them, but they just looked at me like I was crazy.",2017
"How to stay grounded, when life gets wobbly.","Worry, stress and rumination go hand in hand with joy, happiness and good vibes. Finding ways to feel more grounded when times invariably get challenging can be a strategic way to be the best version of yourself. So what makes you feel grounded? You know, that feeling of being firmly rooted, within yourself, your body, and your mind. I liken the sensation to coming home to your house after a long-haul trip, walking through the doors and knowing you have arrived back to a place of safety, comfort and ease. It doesn’t always have to be a place, like home. It can be a person, your mother, partner, best friend or colleague. Someone that offers you a reminder of who you are and where you are, where you don’t have to be anyone for anyone. Better yet, perhaps it’s a feeling. In meditation practice this feeling of being grounded is believed to be found in the present moment. The present moment is this moment, right here, right now. When our minds are focused on the here and now, our attention is switched onto what is naturally occurring inside and outside of us, this means we are not lost in our thoughts of past experiences and future expectations. And let’s be honest, we all tend to get lost in our own minds from time to time. As the new year begins and we have 24 brand new hours for 365 brand new days, there’s bound to be days where our thoughts get the better of us and we begin to feel anxious, overwhelmed and stressed. It’s important we know that we ALL go through patches in our lives that are manic, as a 10-year meditator, I have moments of feeling completely ridden with self-doubt, fear and sadness “Why am I such a bad boyfriend?” “I’m so exhausted, how can I possibly do more classes,” “i’m a terrible teacher, i’m never going to be as good as that person” “I’m just not a good writer.” These are a few of the nonsensical conversations I play out in the soap opera of my mind. Over time i’ve realised that these are simply thoughts, mental projections of an imaginary future or a past memory. They are not who I really am, if I am noticing my thoughts, how could i be them? This insight has got me out of so many tense situations over the years. I’ve also picked up a few more along the way. Here is a list of strategies you can also use to feel more grounded and calm when times get testy. Take off your shoes, place your feet on the floor or carpet. Then take a few moments to feel the sensations of your feet, against the texture of the floor. Scan for sensations around the toes and the tops of your feet, maybe even against your socks or leggings. You can do this from the soles of your feet all the way up to the crown of your head, or however long it takes for you to get your out of your mind and into your body. Getting into your body is a reminder of this moment, you are experiencing sensations right now, not through your memories or through expectation. When we are fearful and anxious, our breath quickens around the chest and heart. This gives us that panicky, anxiety feeling. It can sometimes feel uncontrollable. Without getting into a dialogue about why it is so on this particular day, take a moment to take three deep breaths into your stomach and chest, pausing for a moment then exhaling out of your mouth. Do this three times. Then begin this short and powerful practice taught by the legendary Zen master Thich Nhat Hanh. Find a comfortable seat, with your spine straight, preferably in a place that is quiet. Resting your hands on your thighs, allow yourself to breath again into your stomach, exhaling gently. On your next breath in, mentally say to yourself “breathing in I calm my mind” as you exhale “breathing out I smile” and actually smile. Do this for 2–5 minutes. This mediation has helped me during times where I have felt particularly anxious. Breathing in, I calm body and mind. Breathing out, I smile. – Thich Nhat Hanh Don’t visit your local coffee shop for another round of caffeine or find solace in some real therapy. These as we know are impulsive, temporary fixes and more often than not, make us feel worse afterwards. If you have a park or a tree lined street close-by, take a short stroll. Along the way not judging yourself and your thoughts or what you see, instead paying close attention to noticing and listening. It could be the sound of the birds singing or the kids playing or perhaps it’s the colour of the trees and the sensation of the wind against your skin. Then take a seat somewhere comfortable and listen some more. Maybe with your eyes closed, not analysing the sounds, but genuinely curious about how each sound touches your ear. You will realise after a few moments you are connected through your senses to this moment. Fully engaged. Mindful. The final strategy is probably the hardest, but the most empowering. It’s the recognition you are lost in your thoughts. It’s also the admission that your mind has wondered off into regretfully replaying the past or fearfully projecting yourself into the future — how many emails you have to finish before the end of the day or how you’re going to miss pilates if this old lady crossing the road doesn’t hurry up. This final strategy is pure presence, noticing you are not here and redirecting your attention to this moment. The more often you flex this mindfulness muscle in you brain by bringing your attention to the here and now the stronger it becomes and the more times we are able to gather ourselves before slipping into mental chaos. Try this next time you feel like you’re about to fall of your feet, I’d love to hear your how you go.",2017
You’ll Know What To Do,"Within our family and a close circle of friends she saw weekly at the diner, Ida was famous for her knack of stringing together inspirational cliches in lieu of giving actual advice. It was clear that she often had no idea what advice to give, so she cleverly passed it back to us, disguised as trust that we could solve our own problems. We forgave this quirk because she was impossibly charming. Everyone fell in love with Ida. Waiters, the staff at the doctor’s office, post office employees, hardened motorcycle gangs. She was kind but real; sweet to everyone, but not so prissy she couldn’t rag on the terrible outfit sitting two tables away. She fought hard to have a family — surviving three miscarriages before having my mother, her only child, at 42. If you needed it, she would give you the shirt off her back, then offer you a snack. Though unable to offer any actual guidance or solutions to life’s problems, she gifted my mother, and later me and my brother, with a love and adoration so vibrant it would go unmatched by anyone we’d ever meet again. When it came to her, we ignored the realities of space and time. It seemed cruel and unthinkable that she could ever be taken from us. Eight years since her passing, the phrase “you’ll know what to do,” has become a hilarious, yet bittersweet joke my mom and I toss back and forth when we don’t know what advice to give one another. Though the line never held any actual meaning in the moment it was delivered, recently, after a tough year, I’ve discovered its surprising, if inadvertent wisdom. Ida was long gone before I began wading my way through depression, anxiety and OCD. I’ve tried to imagine how she would have helped, what she would have said. Her life hadn’t been easy, after all — the woman lived through the literal Depression. She’d often talked of nights when her only warmth came from the heat of sleeping under her father’s arm. She valued every single penny she had. I can’t tell you how many times she made me return a $.25 melon because it didn’t “give her her money’s worth.” She also struggled deeply with her own depression when for a long time it seemed she would not be able to have children, and lived with a husband who came with his own incredibly challenging idiosyncrasies. But even though there was much complexity in her life and her relationships, I knew her answer to surviving it all would have been simple: keep busy. Though she had an unfailing belief in the person I was, I felt that over the last few years she’d been terribly wrong about me. I had no clue what to do or how to move forward, and I failed to keep busy. Most days I felt like I was drowning. During those times I desperately wanted someone to pull me out of the water, revive me and tell me exactly what to do. I wanted specific instructions on how to be okay. I read dozens of articles by people claiming to have found the secret to happiness, but reading their optimistic 5-step plans to feeling less anxiety or finding your passion, the words might as well have been written in a foreign language. They were meaningless. They were for other people; people who were actually capable of acting on them. Those who don’t struggle with depression don’t understand how far out of your control it actually is. Hanging a motivational poster on your wall won’t rewire your brain. Saving your pennies won’t stop you from feeling like you are nothing. Through her well-worn cliches, Ida tacitly admitted that she didn’t have the answers and wasn’t about to give you bad advice. I love that about her, now more than ever. I’ll admit that what I needed ultimately came in the form of medication. Now, with renewed clarity, I can look back on Ida’s words and feel comforted by her trust in me to know what to do. That I’m smart enough to figure things out for myself, whether that means getting the help I need or ridding my life of the people and places that wear me down. It’s incredibly tempting to think someone else can find your way for you, or relieve you from the task of making tough decisions. Advice and reassurance were my addiction when I felt lost and lonely, and yet on my worst days, those were the two things that filled me with the most stress. I believe that’s because ultimately no one, not even our dear Ida, knows what will be best for you. She may not have known it at the time, but she was right: only you know what to do.",2017
Monster Wife.,"It happened again. I cannot believe I’m back in this place. It has been fifteen years since I have seen Monster, but it’s back. This time, Monster is pitting in for the fight of each of our lives. “Babe…I think you’re sick. It’s time to go to the doctor.” Those words coming out of the moving lips attached to my husband’s face and travelling to my perpetually humming ears were the first of many bombshells I was going to be hearing over the next few months. Bi-Polar Disorder. Depression. Generalized Anxiety Disorder. Whatever label you want to put on to someone like me, it doesn’t fit. How can you label something inside of the human mind that causes total and complete chaotic destruction of life? It is the most terrifying entity I have ever encountered. It causes the mind to shatter into pieces, creating alternate realities and paranoias to end all forms of comfort and happiness. I call it Monster. Monster hides itself very well in the depths of a beautiful and creative mind, waiting for it’s chance to unleash the internal war that ultimately tears down walls that have been built for years. Walls that have been constructed by therapists, yoga, meditation, pills and endless self-help tactics. Walls made of nothing but chalkdust compared to Monster’s arsenal. Monster snuck in very quietly this time. Monster tricked me into thinking we were some kind of secret team, and nothing or no one could ever know about us. Then, Monster double crossed me and released the most catastrophic warfare I have ever experienced. For fourteen painful months I let Monster try to hurt me by way of harmful thoughts and dangerous self-induced scenarios, none of which I can bring myself to reflect upon without a follow up anxiety attack. I was on my last legs, collapsed and broken down into a pile of shame, regret and downright confusion over it all. Watching everyone’s back turn on me, I decided it was time to let Monster bask in it’s triumph over me. Then, at the last minute I was saved. Love came through to save me. One person who loves me chose to see past the black horns and fiery eyes of Monster, and instead chose to remember that I was still in there somewhere. One person simply chose to love me, accept that I am beautifully broken, and helped me to help myself out of the nightmare. Although Love has not conquered Monster it has been my devoted ally throughout this battle, a battle in which I need all the support I can get. In the war between Love and Monster, I choose Love.",2017
There’s No Such Thing as “The Right Time”,"But there’s a difference between waiting to, say, push your online shop until you’ve got enough designs uploaded, and just waiting around for it to start taking off without pushing it. Because here’s the catch with that whole “good things” quote: If you sit just waiting for good things to happen? Then you’re kinda doing this: When it comes to jumpstarting something we’re passionate about, it’s easy to want to wait for “the right time” to pass go. After all, if everything’s perfect then nothing can go wrong, right? But waiting for “the right time” can be like trying to find the end of the rainbow — you’re spending a lot of time walking towards something that might not exist. And this can become a trap that becomes more self-protective than productive. Because at its core, this cycle of waiting is about fear of failure. By putting off starting something, sure, there’s no risk in it not selling or receiving negative feedback. Safe and comfortable. But by staying frozen in that comfort zone, we take away the messy process of mistakes and trial and error that are kind of essential if we want to improve. In other words, “perfection” can only happen through the process of imperfection. *Cue Inception bwowww* There’s a quote by the writer of A Wrinkle in Time that encourages doing pretty much the opposite of what “good things come to those who wait” preaches: “Inspiration usually comes during work rather than before it.” - Madeleine L’Engle When we have a great idea we’re passionate about, or want to start selling our art, it can be scary. After all, what if you can’t sell the one t-shirt design you thought would be a guaranteed seller? What if you’re not snagging that first sale? What if you get negative feedback, or things don’t turn out how you want? It’s easy to let these fears stop you from moving forward. But you don’t become the artist or successful online store by waiting around and thinking about it — you get there by starting. We don’t become a better artist by thinking about drawing. We don’t learn which one of our tee designs will sell by trying to figure it out in our heads, or grow an audience by waiting for them to come to us. We don’t create a drawing we’re proud of by drawing it perfectly on attempt one. We learn by doing. At the risk of getting meta, when I wrote this piece, I was mid-writer’s block and in the throws of writer’s anxiety. But despite that, I sat down and pushed through it. And it came together. Waiting around for it to come together perfectly in my head would have taught me how to binge-watch Stranger Things on Netflix. But it wouldn’t have taught me how to sit down and kick writer’s block in the butt. Good things don’t come to those who sit around and wait. Good things come to those who push forward.

The anxiety of being POSITIVE,"It has been on my mind that the much acclaimed trend of being “positive” has gone and developed a gnawing cavity. Because positive means feeling like sunshine when you can’t even see the sky, let alone the big burning ball of all things fine. Because positive means trusting the system to work even if it kills people whose sufferings are far too distant for you to understand. Because positivity has begun to sound like a voiceless caricature made of stitched smiles and tearless joy. Something is wrong with the way we are made to feel positive (If feelings even worked that way). Perhaps we should begin with an etymological understanding of the word ‘Positive’. The Oxford dictionary equates it to being Constructive, Optimistic, or Confident — all very dashing words. Its French origin positif translates into ‘certain’. No room for doubt. No space for accepting otherwise. What comes to my mind is the spawn of some of my dreadful dreams — the Clown lurking in the corner of one too-brightly-lit kid’s store, waiting to pounce on me with all his plastic joy. I remember weeping as I smuggled my five year old self through the door — he must have thought it was a true test of his clownhood since he only tried harder to get to me. Fifteen years later I would nod in solemn agreement with DH Lawrence when he writes …they wanted to get enjoyment, perforce, like squeezing blood out of a stone. Poor mountains! poor landscape! it all had to be squeezed and squeezed and squeezed again, to provide a thrill, to provide enjoyment. What did people mean, with their simply determined enjoying of themselves? I recently spoke to a friend who was telling me about some stuff that she was going through — she was feeling sad about it and she just didn’t like it. Okay I understood. Feeling sad isn’t the most desirable emotion. And then I noticed the whole conversation kept going back to how unacceptable it was for her to have all these unhappy feelings. Next it was about how she tried everything she could to stop feeling sad. It reminded of what I read a couple of days back, a piece written by Ashis Nandy posted on Tehelka: ‘Today, the determined pursuit of happiness is a response to a new disease called unhappiness’. I told my friend, just feel as sad as you want. It dawned on me how absurd it is that we don’t let sadness freely run its course like we would when we’re feeling damn good about something. It’s always about cheering up. Or staying positive. I find that it is more than just okay to feel sad (as if it needed permission to deviate from the norm of not being sad). My mentor used to tell me not to lose my quietness which is perhaps central to my business as a writer, and often times I find that this quietness is nurtured by my willingness to feel sad, to feel bitter and angry, to feel detached a.k.a “negative” feelings. It is dangerous sometimes. As it is natural. Just like our body eats itself up when it dies — pain is real and it destroys. Hence mass brainwashing to be positive just to avoid going there even imaginatively. No I am not advocating masochism or any sort of deliberate desire to seek out pain for oneself or for others. But I fear that our anxiety of feeling not-happy, our binary of positive and negative could very well be the reason behind a certain unwholesomeness that plagues many of us. That a teeth-gritting necessity to be positive, that too in a certain “manner” is more unnatural than being freely cynical. Does it count as being positive when people march the streets in protest of injustice? Is it positive to question a system that denies agency for more than half the human race? I would like to quote Dr. Martin Seligman, pioneer of Positive Psychology, whose take on happiness I absolutely abhor: ‘Happiness does not arise from the pink, Sunday school world of happy events.’ Sometimes I hope he was joking when he said that, because pink, Sunday school and happy events all make me very happy. Just as being positive doesn’t always do.",2017
Panic at the ALDI,"Last night my husband & I decided to check out our local neighborhood ALDI since we’ve heard good things & my beloved Whole Foods is hella expensive. I’ve struggled with disordered eating my entire life & while I manage everything significantly better these days it doesn’t mean the illness has disappeared. I’ve just developed new coping skills & loooots of therapy has helped me improve my relationship with food, control, my body, & my sense of self worth. But I still struggle with change — especially when my food routine is disrupted. Shopping at certain stores where I feel comfortable, buying certain foods that feel safe to eat, & sticking to certain brands that I’ve grown accustomed to has helped me take ownership of my eating. But last night I felt ready to venture out into the unknown. Finally ready to conquer a new grocery frontier! When we walked into ALDI I felt confident — new place, new food, new experience — a little scary but I felt in control. I can have fun with this! That is until I became incredibly overwhelmed by all the newness. I had a panic attack right in front of the bottles of “Mountain Frost” soda (“Mountain Dew’s” hillbilly cousin). My mental illnesses pair well with panic attacks & panic attacks don’t give you a lot of warning. One minute you’re hamming it up & the next you’ve made a mad dash to the safe harbor of your Subaru & you’re popping Ativan in the passenger seat. Life can be overwhelming for all of us & we all have different triggers. For some of us it’s a fear of failure, a fear of abandonment, a fear of intimacy. Eating is hard for me. I’ve finally accepted that there will always be some degree of struggle, but I’ve also learned how to forgive myself when I do have the inevitable setback. And while there will always be setbacks, there will also be progress. I had a panic attack at ALDI & I was painfully embarrassed at first — “that wasn’t a part of my plan!” But the thing is, panic attacks are a part of my illness, a part of my life, & thus they’re in my plan whether I like it or not. But I don’t let my panic attacks derail me anymore. I won’t let anorexia consume me again. I take care of myself & I’m in control as much as I can be. Last night I had a panic attack at ALDI but afterwards I went home & I ate dinner & I enjoyed it. Right now my plan is to keep trying, be kind to myself & go back to ALDI this weekend.",2017
Beginning of the End of the Stigma,"Last year, I made an effort to help destigmatize mental illness by being more open about anxiety, depression, therapy, medication, and other mental health related topics. Trying to end the stigma was more challenging than I expected it to be in 2016, and it mostly ended up being a disheartening uphill battle causing me to feel ashamed and at times guilty and worthless. The information — general and personal — that I shared largely was not reciprocated the way I imagined and I saw people’s true colors — some of them weren’t so pretty. I began to think that sometimes people either just do not want to learn and understand or they don’t want to admit and act like they do. I always believed that humans are inherently good — and I still do — but I’ve learned that not all humans are inherently empathetic. I realize that empathizing is a difficult thing to do in general and is especially challenging when it’s something you’ve never experienced first-hand or when it’s over something that you cannot see. As someone who struggles with Seasonal Affective Disorder (appropriately abbreviated as S.A.D.) my depression is in high gear from late October/early November-mid March/early April. This happens every year — some years worse than others — and can be made tolerable with psychotherapy, medication tweaks, and light therapy. Some days are bad, some days are tolerable, some days I’m almost manic, and some days I’m not even sure if my brain and body are on the same planet. You wouldn’t be able to tell I have these issues though (usually) unless I said something or you caught me sitting in front of my Light and Ion Therapy Lamp. Although you might not be able to tell by looking at someone, mental illness is a difficult thing to live with. It’s hard to open up about it and it’s even harder when you’re pushing back against unwanted advice like “just chill out” or “get your s#it together” or “stop being a victim” or “go take a chill pill” or “can’t you f*ck!ng relax for once in your life?” and simultaneously fighting with your brain to just please, just stop being like this. My experience speaking out has made me admittedly a bit bitter, but I do seriously applaud celebrities for using their publicity for good and spreading the message that life does get better. However, when it feels like an endless cycle of ups and downs and during the low points you’re wondering when it’ll stop being hard and during the high — or just tolerable — points you’re wondering when that too will stop, hearing phrases like “it gets better” from someone I’ll never talk to may give me a bit of hope but I still feel alone. If we want to finally end the stigma against mental illness — or other illnesses you cannot see (invisible illnesses) — everyday people need to open up about their struggle too. The more we open up to our friends, coworkers, and acquaintances the less of a taboo these topics become. The more we talk about it, the more people will realize that hey, people get it and that you really are not alone. The more we talk about it, the more we realize that we’re worth something and not just stealing other people’s air. Talking about it can make a difference in someone’s day — or life — and that I believe is worthwhile. So while at times I can get disheartened and self conscious (seriously, I’ve anxiously debated deleting this several times now) I haven’t totally given up hope. So, if you’re reading this, just know you’re not alone, you’re worth something, it does get better, and there are people who understand who will help you feel better — you just need to speak up.",2017
Things to Stop Worrying About in 2017,"I don’t usually do standard New Year’s resolutions; this year, I have some concrete plans and some tentative hopes and that’s about it. However, I’ve recently become aware of what a ridiculous amount of time and energy I spend worrying about pointless things that I either have no control over or am already controlling to whatever extent I can. So, this year, I’m going to try to let these worries go like the leaves in the stream in one of my favorite mindfulness exercises. Self-improvement and self-flagellation aren’t the same thing. Maybe in 2017 I can finally internalize this.",2017
3 easy ways you can use your phone to help manage your anxiety,"The web is full of app recommendations that promise to provide multitude of anxiety managing tools you can fit in your pocket, but there are other ways you can use basic functions on your phone to find calm in uncertain moments. If I’m on a packed tube or stuck in a crowd that’s tricky to get out of, the process of repeatedly flicking between pictures helps me to focus, and distracts me from whatever scenario I am in. On a day that might be particularly challenging you could set one of these photos as your phone’s wallpaper. Your album can be made up of whatever works for you, whether that’s perfectly folded towels or puddles shapped like sad puppies, regardless of how cheesy it may seem. Some people find pictures of water and oceans calming, but I find a clear sky, stars, and endless horizons are a simple reminder that the world I am in is huge, and this helps me to feel less trapped both physically and mentally. 2. Write yourself a note to read in any pre-panic moments. Biological explanations* of physical symptoms I might be experiencing help me to rationalise what was happening inside my body, and occasionally stop it from escalating. If this doesn’t do it for you, try creating a list of things you want to remind the ‘panic you’, or getting someone else to write comforting notes for that you can read whenever you need to. Reading through this list when I start to feel the all to familiar tight chest and tingly hands and feet, or when trying to recollect and recover after an attack, helps me remember that I am OK. 3. Create a list of favourite contacts. Sometimes speaking to a friend can help, but getting your shaky hands to fumble down a contacts list while trying to convince yourself that it’s OK to ask for help is sometimes a challenge. By using your phone’s speed dial function, you can create a list of people who you know make you feel better, and who don’t mind speaking to you in a particularly anxious moment.",2017
You need to do more than grow your mind—you need to train it,"If I asked how you train your mind, what would you say? If any of those things are true, then you’re doing a great job of feeding your mind. But what happens when you feed yourself and don’t workout? You get flabby. People who hit the gym regularly have bodies that show it. The same is true for people who condition their minds. Conditioning isn’t about feeding your brain new information or finding productivity “hacks,” it’s about creating a training routine for your mind. Thinking of your mind as a physical thing, a concept we call the body-mind, is a big shift for some people, but it’s fundamental to conditioning. People who can’t conceptualize this are always at the mercy of their reptile brain and have little control over their thoughts. I’ve written this how-to for conditioning your mind for people who don’t want to be victims of circumstance. If you want to be in your mind’s driver seat, the first step is to understand the physical forces that control your mind. It’s very easy to get lost in abstractions when discussing the mind. Anyone who’s spent a considerable amount of time in a college dorm room has been witness to at least one debate over “what is consciousness.” Your state of mind comes from your body. It’s that simple. Let me give you an example using a tool I built called The Cure. The Cure is a four step process to get yourself out of any negative state. It works like this: If you don’t believe me, try it right now. I guarantee you that doing this will change how you feel. Do it dozens of times a day and you will be training your body-mind to more naturally feel this way. Why does The Cure work so well? Because 95% of negative states can be traced to one of three causes (or a combination of three causes): The Cure physically disrupts these negative influences. It gives you conscious control of your body-mind, not by journaling or “practicing gratitude,” but by physically engaging your brain. “When I look back at my life, I am happy to have had what most people would consider a successful life, not only in terms of business, but in my relationships and in lots of ways. More than anything else, I attribute it to meditation.” — Ray Dalio Ray’s not wrong. I try to meditate for an hour every day, and can tell you that meditation is the greatest tool for maintaining your mind. However, meditation is a terrible tool for conditioning your mind. It’s great for becoming aware of your thoughts and over time, learning to stop those thoughts from consuming you, but that’s different to conditioning your mind for top performance. Conditioning is strengthening yourself through repetition. Top athletes condition their bodies and mind constantly. For example, if you watched the Rio Olympics, you wouldn’t be at fault for thinking that Michael Phelps has anger management issues: But what you’re seeing there is pure mental conditioning. Michael has a ritual for top performance, one he practices every day, so that his mind is fired up like a race car when it’s time to win. This isn’t easy to do, but it ALWAYS pays off. As Nico Rosberg put it after winning the Formula 1 World Championship a couple of weeks ago: “I put everything into it. Had a mental trainer and made massive progress as a result. Mental training is difficult. It is on and on.” Just like conditioning your body, conditioning your mind is about repeating the same “exercise” until you get stronger. Your specific ritual might differ, but the basic keys to conditioning your mind remain the same. When I start working with a client, I walk them through my System for a Limitless Mind. The system is a bit too broad to detail in full here, but part of it is mental conditioning. Here’s the three-step process for conditioning your mind that I walk every client through: No matter what weakness your mental conditioning is addressing, you need to understand the mechanisms behind it. In my article on overcoming anxiety, I broke down the two foundations of anxiety: Fear and overwhelm. The two work in a postitive feedback loop: Until you break it down to really understand the mechanisms behind your weakness, you won’t be able to pick the right tool to address it. In the case of anxiety, the tool I recommend is The House of Flow. The condensed version looks something like this: The House of Flow is a tool you can use to control your body-mind and enter a flow state whenever you’d like. It’s one of many tools I developed and tested on myself for years before unleashing it on my clients. When I wrote about anxiety, a lot of commenters wrote something along the lines of, “he just doesn’t get how hard it is for me.” Wrong. I know how awful these patterns are from the inside-out, and as long as you’re whining about how bad they are, you’re failing to practice the tools that will help you overcome them.. Your tool will change depending on what you want to condition, but in general, it will be a routine you can repeat to take control of your body-mind and shift yourself in the right direction. Conditioning only works if you do it constantly. If you run 10 miles today, then wait six months to run another 10, you’ll have conditioned yourself less than someone who jogs a half mile every day. Analyze your daily routine and figure out when it makes the most sense to practice your ritual. If you’re conditioning yourself against anxiety, figure out the moments in your day when you’re most anxious. Consistency is everything here. The mind is a muscle, and like your biceps, quads, pecs, and every other muscle, it needs constant stimulation to get stronger. Everyone knows discipline is critical, but most people have terrible misconceptions about what discipline actually is. If you’re visualizing a Rocky montage where you punish your body and mind, getting by only through sheer willpower, you’re setting yourself up for failure. If you want to see what I’m talking about, stop by a gym this January. You’ll see dozens of people who have spent every day that week in the gym. They made a New Year’s resolution to get in shape, and they’re channelling their inner Sylvester Stallone. Two weeks later they’ll all be gone. It’s not because they’re weak, it’s because they’re relying on motivation to get them to the gym every day. Motivation doesn’t get results. Discipline does. Starting new habits is not easy, yet even the smallest action repeated regularly will allow you to reap huge rewards. And with a little consistency, you’ll soon find yourself entering a new positive feedback loop, one where discipline leads to the conditioning of your mind, which in turn strengthens your discipline. Over time, this will leave you feeling better and better and better. And who doesn’t want to practise things that feel amazing?",2017
Anxiety with Cultural Conflict,"Throughout my life I have often wondered, and asked the question: what is my natural and true self, and what is my conditioned self? From the day we are born, we are raised, or conditioned, to behave a certain way, believe certain things, become a certain person. This is also known as socialization, and although many of this is needed in order for us to navigate through the world and socialize with other human beings, a lot of what we are taught is also stemmed from a place of fear and can create much anxiety in a child’s upbringing. Parents, and society as a whole, worry about the safety of children, as well as the general safety and well-being of the society. We worry about our health, our sense of belonging, and our self-esteem. These are all positive things to worry about, as it is needed in order for our survival. But my question is, how much of this ‘worry’ actually affects us in a negative sense, and how detrimental is our socialization to our personal beings, or personal selves? I read an article titled ‘Law, Cultural Conflict, and the Socialization of Children’, which discusses how society often uses cultural politics to depict a particular image of how each gender, race, religion, etc., is meant to appear, behave, and what to believe. This image is used throughout media, within the family, school systems, and with religion. which is all primarily regulated by politicians/lawmakers. As the article states: “In today’s cultural politics, when a massage links children’s welfare with control over their socialization, the astute listener will ask whether the message may indicate as much about the cultural identities of the targeted audience as it does about the well-being of any child.” (Karst, 2003). And as the article further explains, we use our anxieties over the welfare of children for two reasons: (one) we are concerned about people’s beliefs and identities, for we want others to self-identify with Us and not with Them; and (two) we are concerned with the behaviours of others, as we want people to believe and follow the same values as ours. Although this ideal is intended to create a sense of unity and belonging, most people not identify with all of these ideals and images, and each gender, race, religion, etc., has different ideals and images, as well as different ideals to adhere to, which keeps us constantly separate, divided, and unequal. For a society is easily managed and controlled when they are divided, and within conflict of each other. There is also cultural conflict, where on one side we have cultural moral claims and on the other we have a groups’ authoritative meaning. I would like to discuss furthermore how society uses anxiety as a means to invent social categories and influence our sense of self identity; creating anxiety induced by fear of not fitting in or belonging to a particular social group. Not being accepted by society as a whole, which causes an inner conflict with who we are as individuals, as well as further creates a divide between the sexes, genders, religions, races, etc. This conflict causes a cultural status and enforces that people remain in the status deemed upon them as to keep society from not deviating from the ‘norm’. I want to explain further of how these ‘normalizations’ and ‘socializations’ affect our well-being and sense of self-worth. Anxiety is a feeling that arises when we feel nervous, worried, or at unease in a particular situation or with a particular person. There is both positive and negative anxiety which we experience, and is primarily felt for survival reasons. As mentioned above, we need to learn certain behaviours in order to navigate through life and to be able to communicate and socialize with other human beings. For example, we need to have a feeling of anxiety when crossing the street, so we will be more careful and vigilant of the cars and pedestrians around us. Since this type of anxiety protects us from harm and ensures our survival of yet another day, it is important to socialize people to be fearful of traffic. The same anxiety is also felt when we associate with another person who just does not “feel” right to us. Our bodies are essentially telling us to be wary and vigilant in the circumstance in order to best protect our self. Then of course, there is negative anxiety, which is anxiety that we feel when we do not fit in, or that we do not belong in a particular environment. Negative anxiety is also felt when we are concerned with what others may think or feel about us. It is this negative anxiety that is used to influence or manipulate what we believe, and what social category in which we belong. This, in turn, plays a major role in developing our self-identity. For if a person is experiencing high levels of anxiety in situations where they do not feel that who they are, or their behavior, is accepted, they will work harder to not behave or ‘be’ a particular way within that group. Thus creating a constant feeling of anxiety and fear for being anything that goes against the norm. It is this negative type of anxiety which is harmful to the well-being of a society, as it perpetuates discrimination, and prejudice. It is also harmful to the individual, as they may not be able to move freely within the society as the person they choose, or born, to be. In the United States, religion (that is, Christianity) plays a major and powerful role in our culture and our contemporary politics (Laymen, Carmines, 1997), since it largely influences our moral claims. The conflict with this is that there is a large proportion of people in the United States, that either do not believe in Christianity or religion is less important them with regards to politics and society as a whole. As Inglehart (1990) argues, Western societies are increasingly divided into two parts: (one)the Materialists, who are focused on material and economic goals; and (two) the Post-materialists, who are primarily concerned with issues of equality, women’s rights, environment and energy. We can also describe these two groups as the liberals (Post-materialists) and the conservatives (Materialists). The Materialists are usually the group who is more religious (i.e. Christian beliefs) and mostly concerned with following a more traditional path. Contrasted with the Post-materialists, who do not recognize, and often ignore, religion as being a major factor in our socialization. This is not to say that Post-materialists are not religious, but that they rather view our politics, social culture, and economics, as something separate from our socialization in society. Both groups use fear, and induce anxiety as a means of socializing a society to behave according to the same values and beliefs that is dominant within that particular community, or domain. So when you live in a society who has high religious values, that also influence the political atmosphere and the cultural politics, then a strong sense of what is normal is used to socialize children, and adults, to behave and to become that image that is deemed upon them. For example, if the religion is very much against homosexuality, there will be laws created that opposes homosexual rights. And because the society sees the law is rejecting homosexuality, they too will enforce that ‘norm’ within the society. This creates anxiety and fear for both people who do and who do not identify with homosexuality. For in one group, they are rejecting the variation from the ‘norm’, and in the other group, they fear for their survival and acceptance within the society. In other words, each group has a sense of moral claims, and interprets this in their own way. To a Materialist, their moral claim is following religious values, and they place high authoritative meaning to these religious values. Because there is a strong sense of uniting a community, as a united community is stronger than a divided community, fear and anxiety is used as a weapon to those who deviate from the group as they are a threat to keeping the community together. Post-materialist uses the same tactic of fear and anxiety within their belief systems. They have placed a moral claim on women’s rights, for example, and their authoritative meaning to what women’s rights are may be different to a Materialist, let’s say. But anyone who does not believe in the same meanings as they do, are ostracized and condemned of their variation. We all have a deep sense to belong and to feel that we belong within our communities and society, by feeling slightly different, causes anxiety within us. But what is normal really? And who gets to decide what it means to be normal? As I have already discussed, religion plays a powerful role in influencing our beliefs and who we are as individuals. Politics, and the law, also significantly determine what is right and wrong within our culture. And often times, our politics is influenced by the religious values held by the law/policy makers. But another factor to consider with our socialization, is the ideologies that are held through our cultural orientation. This does not necessarily mean where a person is from, or their cultural heritage, but includes factors such as, race, education, gender, age, region, size of community, and income. Each of these factors adheres to different ideologies of what is normal to them, and each of these normalizations also creates and influences further cultural conflict within the society. For example, I am a white, middle class woman, in my early thirties, living in San Francisco. In each of these categories I am expected to behave in a particular way, or viewed by others to be. We could determine that because I am middle class, I am probably fairly well educated, and I am a woman living in a liberal region, which could determine that I am liberal and a feminist. The Bay Area is known to be liberal, and children, as well as adults, are primarily socialized to be liberal. If I am all of these things, then I should feel that I belong within the community in which I live. But if I deviated from any of these expectations, that is perhaps I am supportive of a patriarchal system, then I would feel intense anxiety to express that in the community that is largely against patriarchy. This, in turn, affects my self-identity in a negative way, as I am unable to move freely within the society I live. To truly learn who we are, and how we have been socialized, we would have to closely analyze each aspect that influences us as individuals. Let that be, our values, beliefs, cultural orientations, and politics. In conclusion, there are many variables that determine who we are, and how we behave. Each social category has expectations and roles that are placed upon them by our cultural politics. And each of these categories is influenced by a variety of factors within our society, as well as each category influences and interplays with each other. This is our interconnection. Some of these factors can be used for the survival and the benefit of our development in living amongst other and keep a society safe and united. But many of our socializations place us into categories that are deemed as ‘normal’, which may not be normal for the individual, and can, in fact, be negative to our emotional and mental well-being. These socializations often ignore the variations of human beings, and further place stereotypes and stigmas on those who deviate from the norm. Thus creating conflict and inequality within the society, not to mention it further perpetuates prejudice, hate, and discrimination. Having differences and variations within a society is a good thing, and is needed for the society to further progress and evolve. A truly progressive and healthy society is one that is inclusive and uses all of our differences to interconnect each community and learn to grow and thrive with each other. But we must be careful with how we use fear and anxiety in creating a society, and be mindful as to what and how we are socializing people to behave. As socialization does not only affect our society, it plays a significant role in our own feelings of self-worth. References: Ingelhart, Ronald. 1990. Culture shift in Advanced Industrial Society.

Don’t panic…,"You don’t realize how bad a panic attack really is until you have one. I remember walking through my dorm hall — an acne-ridden, nervous 18-year old freshman—hearing my neighbors discuss their panic attacks before midterms, finals, and/or heading home for the holidays. Most of these people were strangers, and still are, just like how the idea of a panic attack was a strange concept to me. They can’t really be having that much anxiety, can they? I had dealt with a variety of problems in my youth that varied in intensity and thus effected upon my own anxiety. Poor grades led to disappointment for my parents, which led to internal shame; over-exhaustion from extracurriculars led to laziness in my free-time, which led to anxiety over grades and college applications; an uncle’s fall from his three-story house led to his reliance on a ventilator, which led to my depression. There were many issues that led to stress points, but I had never had a panic attack. Depression, stress and anxiety were long-lasting, just like the problems they stemmed from. Panic attacks seemed to me, at the time, to be an overzealous reaction to something in the moment. Someone who suffered a panic attack could get over it quickly, without a lasting effect. It wasn’t that serious. Then I had my first panic attack. I don’t remember exactly what caused the panic attack — but, as I’ve realized since, there doesn’t always need to be a concrete cause. Below are just a few of the nine panic attacks I’ve had in the last 4 years. It was sometime after Halloween my junior year of college, and I was in the shower. Our apartment took a lot of liberties with the definition of apartment, as our windows didn’t fit into their respective frames, there was no common living space, there was obvious water damage in the walls, and our annoyed landlord had no time or common decency to accommodate these basic repairs. One of the three of us moved out because of the landlord’s lack of humanity, and that left my other roommate and myself to figure out how to pay the next month’s rent with an extra $760. With the prospect of finding a reliable roommate, plus dealing with the slumlord who basically threatened our first roommate out of the “apartment,” I was very obviously stressed. It didn’t help that I had also been bleeding — albeit not on my period—for a little over a week, and could not find a reason as to what was happening. As I was showering, I began to cry, which led to fully fledged heavy breathing, then shortness of breath, and shakes. I was only in this state for a few minutes, if that, but as soon as I came back to “normal,” I knew I never wanted to experience that sensation again. Winter Quarter, Sunday before finals week, senior year. This was my first quarter with less than 20 units for almost a year and half. I was so ready to be done with all of my finals — which, in actuality, weren’t taking too much time or effort — and be able to go back to my shitty aPodment and watch Hulu. I was in the college library’s downstairs Mac computer lab, lovingly known as my second home, finishing a bit of work on my English final for my thesis. It was about 8 PM, which was typically when my parents called me or I called them for our weekly chat. I know, I know — talking to your parents once a week at a set time may seem excessive, but I’m an only child and don’t want to give them too much grief. Anyhow, as per usual, I call the home phone—goes to voicemail. My mom’s cell — also voicemail. My dad’s cell —voicemail. Confused, I try the home phone number again, and get stuck in a cycle of calling and hearing the away message. While this would likely not cause many people grief or worry, my parents have never missed a call without forewarning, and usually call me right back if they just got home. The cycle turned into 15 minutes, then half an hour, and by the time it was almost 9 PM, I could feel my cheeks getting red and my chest tightening. I tried to maintain some sense of cool — I was in the library during finals, after all—but the panic I felt would not stifle. What if they had been driving and been hit by a drunk driver? What if my dad had been driving under the influence? What if they were in the hospital, and no one knew to call me because how could they know to call me on Sunday at 8 PM? I continued to panic for another half hour, the thoughts of what could have happened churning furiously in my brain. A fellow English student, who had graduated the year before, stared at me from behind his iMac like I was being exorcised. No matter how hard I tried, I couldn’t hide my fear, my worry, my sense of utter desperation and despair over a tragedy I had simply imagined. A whole 105 minutes after I had called home the first time, I got a call back from my Dad’s cell. Oh, we were at a banquet, and my phone was on vibrate, he said, his hearing loss accounting for the lack of an answer. My phone was off HB, sorry, my mom says, driving the two of them home. It’s fine, I say. Just don’t do that again, looking at myself in the window. Let me give you some context, first and foremost: I do not like the idea of relationships. I think relying on someone too much can be damaging on your sense of self and on your ability to achieve growth. I have grown up believing that you can really only rely and trust on one person—yourself—so always keep your guard up around others. That being said, I strayed away from romantic relationships and emotional connections with guys until…X. He was just a crush at first, someone to think about and blush over, but not someone to drink with on the weekends, kiss, sleep with. He was an unattainable entity, and I appreciated that fact, and kept my distance. Then, I learned that he felt pretty similarly about me…and we decided, to hell with it, let’s be unattainable together. What should have been a one night stand — my most memorable and enjoyed, at that— turned into talking, teasing, and raw and fervent desire. After a month and a half of this playful “maybe” and “you sure you don’t wanna?”, I brought up the fact that I may want something more. X did not. We didn’t see each other for a week or so after that—as he said, he was “busy” with research—and then he texted me out of the blue to say he wanted to meet up for happy hour. We met, I got a bit tipsy, we flirted and teased…and then X told me he was hooking up with his ex again. I felt like I had been punched in the stomach, the air coming out of my mouth like clouds of unheard screams. “What?” “Well, if it doesn’t work out, you’ll be the first to know.” We talked for a bit longer without any real resolution; I left X at his bike to him saying he’d be thinking of me when he went home to “relax,” and me walking to my car. I don’t think I’d sobbed that much in a while. The ride home consisted of many more tears, shortness of breath, and trying to listen to punk rock to soothe my sadness, to no avail. It didn’t really feel like a panic attack, but it was just as close as I remembered, months in the past. *** The other half-attack happened only a week later — literally as close to the time as when I had left him at his bike. We had seen each other since — X, drunkenly texting me to make out at a festival that Sunday; me, telling him the next day to not treat me like a backup plaything. Then, as on any Friday—date night—I see X with her. In line, waiting to order food as I walk past with my tacos. I couldn’t just ignore him—he turned just as I was trying to get away—and I couldn’t believe that he was even there, having told me he’d be away for the weekend. X fumbled over his reason for being in town—mainly, having lied to me—and she smiled, looking so happy to be there, like a puppy getting her first toy. I told them to have a good night—him blushing from being caught or what, I don’t know—and went to my car, heading to a date of my own. I started breathing more rapidly as I got into the parking lot, a good 100 feet away from where they were waiting in line, and felt the shortness of breath coming on as I got in the driver’s seat. Stop it, stop it, I told myself. Maybe this next guy will be even better. Maybe you won’t panic from how he treats you. November 8, 2016. 7:45 PM. I never thought that a political candidate, let alone a presidential election, could cause me to have a panic attack. And yet… As I drove home from the gym, I listened to NPR’s broadcast of the incoming results. Trump had won Florida, and was ahead of Hillary in electoral votes by a fair amount. What the fuck is the matter with people, I said, driving through the rain and my tears as I continued to listen. What will we do. I got home, and refused to watch the television reports, or listen to anything else. People are upset honey, my mom said as I dropped my bags on the floor. They want something different. So do I, I thought, as my chest continued to heave up and down. So do I. ——— I’m hoping that, with the amount of panic I’ve had thus far in my life, this next year will be just a bit calmer. We can only hope. Read more about panic attacks here and see what you can do to help your loved ones when they suffer an attack.",2017
Philosophical Mediation For Anxiety,"In my previous post entitled F*ck Feelings: Practical Ways to Manage Anxiety, I mentioned briefly a term called Philosophical Meditation. While I explained briefly what the term meant, I’d like to elaborate on exactly how effective this kind of meditation truly is. According to the School of Life, which has become my new favorite Youtube Channel, Philosophical Meditation is inspired by Western philosophical methods of coping with anxiety. What we consider to be traditional meditation is an Eastern philosophical practice that emphasizes the removal of oneself from what is causing you distress. It advocates that you remove yourself physically to a quiet and undisturbed location and allow yourself to take on an objective view of what you feel. This is particularly effective if you are in dire need of focus and calm, however the key to Eastern meditation is that you must physically remove yourself from everything. What if there was a way to meditate without removing yourself, closing your eyes, or focusing intensely for several minutes? You’re not gonna believe this, but there is. Philosophical Meditation is the act of identifying your thoughts and feelings and rationalizing exactly what you fear. Let me tell you, it works wonders. For example, imagine that tomorrow is your first day at a new job. You’re very very anxious and your mind is spinning with what ifs and its driving you mad. Here’s how you use Philosophical Meditation to regulate your anxiety. Do not try to understand why you’re feeling afraid, try to get a grasp of exactly what is causing you to feel afraid. Are you afraid that you’ll get to work late, make a bad impression, make stupid mistakes, or end up hating the job? Identify exactly what is causing you grief and write them out on a notepad. Here is where you tackle your fears head on. Show no mercy. Take a second to write out exactly why these fears are overblown or irrational then make a plan of action. If you’re worried about being late, write down your plan to avoid being late plan your route carefully and set your alarm to wake you up a little earlier. Ask yourself, “What if I’m late anyways? What happens then?” Then you can begin to rationalize your thoughts by saying something along the lines of, “Well, I have a contact that I can email/call if something goes awry, and people probably understand that I don’t really understand the best routes to get there yet. It’s only the first day, they expect you to mess up.” The key to Philosophical Meditation is to force that grey area of unaddressed improbabilities into the spotlight, and to break them down using rationality and logic. I can’t tell you how many times this has helped me cope with my ridiculously severe anxiety. I find that my fears do not stand up to much scrutiny when in the lime light. It simply doesn’t take much for our insecurities to fall apart. In part, this may be because our emotions protect these fears to a great extent. Your emotions act as a kind of barrier to deter you from delving into what you fear simply because you fear them. If you deny your feelings influence over you for a moment and just get to the core of what you are afraid of, you will begin to see some real improvements. If you find yourself growing anxious again, return to your notepad and read what you fear and your rationalizations of your fears. I doesn’t matter how many times you have to remind yourself, just do what it takes to manage your anxiety. You can watch the School of Life video about Philosophical Mediation here.",2017

"Tales from the Lizard Brain, Part 1","I stared at the text conversation in front of me. I had only gone out with this guy twice, and I was already stressing out. We had been consistently texting back and forth until one of my questions — a fairly innocuous one asking how his evening was going — went unanswered. It had been nearly two days. That’s not a good sign, the rational part of my brain was saying, referring not to the guy, but to the anxiety that bloomed within me. It sounded like a calm whisper. You need to chill. I took a deep breath. I was on a plane to Amsterdam, ready to spend the next week eating and drinking and exploring a new city. I was supposed to be happy and excited, reveling in my singledom. My rational side kept trying to reassure me to combat the jagged sensations that hummed frenetically within my chest. It’s the holidays. He’s traveling and so are you. It’s okay if you two aren’t communicating. Anyway, even if he was ghosting you, move on. Why care so much about a guy who isn’t reciprocating? Onto the next one! Yeah, okay. I kept breathing. I put on a meditation podcast. My brain was reset 20 minutes later. I was fine. I was fine. I wasn’t fine. I could feel the sleeping giant stir again after a couple hours. The cramped confines of the airplane, exhaustion, and apprehension about my trip wasn’t helping. The anxiety crept back in. And a discombobulating sense of panic rose up. Unlike my rational brain, my lizard brain didn’t tend to speak in words, but rather in emotions and sensations. Why didn’t he text back? the emotions were saying. What’s wrong with me? Why does this keep happening? I was getting better at translating these feelings, but I couldn’t quite figure out why I kept experiencing them or where they were coming from. I got to Amsterdam and made my way to my hostel. It was cold, cloudy, and gray, and the wet streets from a recent rainstorm were muddied and filled with errant trash. I was in a bad mood and the weather was perfect for it. I spent the rest of the day and the next afternoon wandering around the city, trying to escape my anxious thoughts, but no amount of effort seemed to lessen them. As usual, it was time that brought relief. Finally, the clouds had cleared, and as I took in the vibrant colors of the sunset over the canals, not only did I know that everything would be okay, but felt it as well. Feeling satisfied, I turned on my phone to check out where to go next. A text popped up. “How’s Amsterdam?” It was him. I felt relieved and happy and my world became a little bit brighter, despite the little niggling annoyance in the back of my mind. We continued texting sporadically throughout my trip and he eventually asked me out once I returned. Everything did turn out all right. But then it didn’t. And then it did. And so on. Something about this guy made me turn into an overthinking mess whenever I didn’t hear from him for more than a day. This isn’t going to work out, the rational side of me was saying. The whisper was louder. Go away, I told it. My lizard brain agreed with me. Of course, sure enough, it didn’t work out. After a couple attempts on my end to see him again, and an ever-increasing sense of unhappiness and stress, I got a clue. I texted him, letting him know I enjoyed spending time with him, but I got the feeling that perhaps he wasn’t interested. I was hoping to open up a conversation, but instead I got a ghost, something I had been afraid of all along. My anxieties redoubled their efforts and I was flailing about in a whirlwind of negative emotions. I knew this disproportionate response — I had known him for only a month — wasn’t about the guy, but what he represented for me. I have unresolved issues that I need to address. What were they? What were they? I continue to meditate, and to journal, to figure it out.",2017
F*ck Feelings: Practical Ways to Manage Anxiety,"Whenever I would share a certain aspect of my life that I struggle with, people would gasp in disbelief. “I would never have guessed!!” The surprise on their face looks in no way fabricated to hide the fact that they knew all along and was trying to be polite. No, they are always genuinely surprised and bewildered that a person so put-together as me can struggle so much with anxiety. The truth is everyone deals with anxiety to some extent, but a few of us struggle on a severe degree (like me). However, I’m here to reassure you that even the most severe anxiety can be managed! I’ve had general anxiety since I was 12 years old. Suddenly, the things I found common place evoked feelings of dread and pain. My body grew paralyzed and in shock without warning, and I couldn’t shake that painful, searing feeling of panic and dread. It’s similar to the sensation you would get if someone was holding a gun to, not your head, but to the head of someone you love. I’ve always been on the outside looking in when it came to controlling my emotions, as if my brain was on auto pilot. I dealt with the pain all throughout college until last month I picked a book called F*ck Feelings. Before I begin to list coping mechanisms I learned from this awesome book, I’m going to give a brief overview of what’s going on in your brain when you have anxiety. Anxiety is the normal reaction to when you brain perceives some situation, object or person to be some how threatening. However, for people who suffer with excessive anxiety our brain creates a life threatening situation from a situation that isn’t at all life threatening. I find that before I even step into the made up “life threatening” situation, my brain is already preparing my body to fight or flight! That’s when your anxiety spirals. Before any situation occurs, your body is preparing to defend itself. Thoughts may fly through your mind about all the reasons you may want to opt for the “flight” option, but then you may feel guilty about doing that. So you consider the “fight” option, but it’s so painful, so you’re back to square one. Though this sounds troubling, all is not lost! Over the years I’ve learned how to cope with my anxiety and I’m excited to share them. According to the School of Life, Philosophical Mediation is the act of thinking through the things you are anxious about. Are you afraid of missing your flight? Think about if you actually did miss your flight? What would your plan be? Would it be the end of the world? Probably not. This western style of meditation focuses on creating solutions to the problems you’ve created in your mind. Don’t blow your eardrums out, but listening to music at louder volumes has been proven in a few studies to relax you. Try turning up your tunes and tuning out the world. Go ahead and accept the fact that you cannot control your anxiety. You can’t command it to stop when you get frustrated and you can’t tell it to roll over or play dead. Anxiety doesn’t work that way. Instead of fighting so hard to stop your anxiety, learn to regulate it. Learn little ways that you can manage your anxiety when you feel it coming on strong. I like to rationalize what I’m being anxious about. Force your fears into the lime light and call into question whether it’s actually work freaking out over. Once I’ve zeroed in on what I’m actually afraid of, I quickly learn that it isn’t rational at all. From there, I counsel myself using logic and rational. “Okay, I’m afraid of X, but in reality…” “If X does happen, then Y is the plan for getting past it.” Don’t try to fight away how you feel. Instead, take a second to confront your feelings. Bad things WILL happen, but think about your plan when they do. It’s a fruitless task to be constantly in fear of bad things. I’ve been reading an excellent book called F*ck Feelings by Sarah and Michael Bennett. The book provides practical, brutally honest advice on how to deal with your anxiety. One key piece of advice the book provides is don’t be upset with yourself if you get too anxious to do something, just accept what you can’t control and manage what you can. If you allow your anxiety to get the better of you and it causes you to behave in a way contrary to the way you prefer, don’t become guilty or usept with yourself. Forgive yourself and make a note to be more careful next time. Self-destruction is a wicked cycle. You do something wrong, then you beat yourself up, then you become more anxious/depressed, then you do something wrong again. The cycle continues. End the cycle and make a point to give yourself a break. As F*ck Your Feelings so eloquently states, do NOT try to go rooting around in your childhood, subconscious or heart and soul to figure out where you anxiety is coming from. It’s a pointless way to avoid dealing with the problem. However you got it doesn’t matter so much, all that matter is that you have anxiety right now and need to deal with it. Instead, try to figure out what it is your afraid of and how you can deal with it. I have pretty severe anxiety according to my doctors and these tips have been so incredibly life changing! I know they can be for you too. Just remember not to take life too seriously. Have fun and reward yourself when you rationalize your fears or manage your anxiety in scary situations.",2017
6 Ways to ‘Beat the Blues’ this January,"By Writerdina The new year for most people presents an opportunity for fresh starts, exciting anticipation for living better and being better. We all in one way or another consider personal wellbeing resolutions. Are you planning to loose that weight again this year? Good for you, please keep it up it will have been worth it. For people suffering with depression however, this time of year especially following the holiday festivities, is a most challenging time. This article is about how to cope with depression. Read how Leah is finding ways to cope with depression after a failed relationship. Leah’s story is not unique in the sense that broken relationships are not new phenomena – but the depression that sprung out of it is essentially the bigger problem that must be addressed. Depression is more than simply feeling unhappy or fed up for a few days, everyone sometimes goes through spells of feeling down, but when you’re depressed you feel persistently sad for weeks or months, rather than just a few days. For Leah Christmas and the New Year have been sore times, but she’s amassed coping strategies for moments when she might feel really blue. Remember that every person that suffers depression is very unique, if you think you are depressed it is important that you consult your doctor to determine a personal strategy for managing the illness. Although this list Leah discusses helpful tips, it should not be used as a diagnostic tool or indeed as fact for dealing with your own depression. 1. When you can’t hold it in, let it out: “When life was good, I don’t remember ever needing to ‘purge’ emotionally, not the way I do now anyway. Sometimes depression can take you places where you lose yourself to a shamed personality you won’t recognise. The anger, rage or intensity of aching sadness is nothing I could articulate clearly to anyone – it overwhelms and terrifies me. The decision to seek help with my depression became urgent when I, for no apparent reason, threw a bottle of wine across the room against a wall upon which it broke. I was alone at the time and was terrified that I felt so out of control as my anger unfolded. I thereafter started to see my counsellor who has been tremendous help. Through my counselling sessions I’ve learnt so much about my own depression. I’ve learnt that talking is the most difficult for me to do and took up journaling as an alternative. My counsellor and I call it the ‘purging journal’; it helps to have a sense of humour about things.” 2. Have at least one ‘conscious check’ in the day to gauge how sad you are feeling: “I found that at times I could go on for days feeling treacherously depressed and exhausted. Those were the days before I sought help; I locked myself indoors and could never bring myself to talk to anybody. I’ve now learnt that though these episodes may occur from time to time, it’s really important for me to stop and check how I’m feeling. The advice I got was to learn to recognise when I had gone past the ‘threshold mark’ of my depressed state which my counsellor and I determined for me. So when I’d feel completely beyond this, I would promptly call ‘Talking Space Oxfordshire’, a UK national health depression referral service. This is often a challenge, but I’m learning to give it a chance. Other times I’d call my neighbour who now knows my condition and we’d go on long silent walks down the Oxford canal.” 3. Use quotes that mean something to you to cheer you up or to refocus you: “Using inspirational quotes have been the most focusing tool for immediately bringing my focus back to reality. I put post-it notes all over the back of my bedroom door as well as particular places in my house like at the top of the stairs and on the fridge door in the kitchen. I also keep a small note book where I write new ones that I come across. Admittedly I don’t respond to quotes the same way all the time, sometimes I read an inspiring quote and it helps re-centre me, other times I feel disconnected so having a selection helps.” 4. Listen to music that elevates your mood: “From the start of therapy my counsellor helped me understand the power of environmental factors in either improving or diminishing my depression. Music was a subject we talked about at length because for me, music has always defined my past in one form or another. I have always been a Paul McCartney and a ‘Beatles’ fan and when I’m feeling ‘out of sorts’ I default to ‘Let It Be’, which is my favourite track of all time.” 5. Engross yourself into work or hobby: “I’ve been unemployed since pretty much the day my ex broke off our engagement. Finding a hobby in which to completely immerse myself was my counsellor’s idea – which would help me engage with my surroundings as well as distract me from focusing on my negative state of mind. It took a while to find something new, my old hobbies meant nothing anymore plus I was exhausted mentally trying to think of potentials. I really didn’t want to do anything like this but through much help from my counsellor; I found the ukulele which I have come to love and joined my local ukulele workshop. It’s challenging to play the right chords, but I’m gradually learning and hope I can stick with it”. 6. Showing love and humanity to the less fortunate: “In the last two years of my depression the idea of love has become, for me, something alien. I consciously resist romantic advances basically because am still angry and sad about my broken relationship. I realise it’ll take time to heal – I want to be better – I don’t want to remain in this rut for any longer than I need to so although I resist romantic love, I want to feel and show love of an overall compassionate nature. I’d started thinking of getting a dog, when instead by sheer accident I met and befriended Wendy – a homeless lady from the streets of Oxford. She’s the loveliest, well-spoken, and intelligent woman I have ever met. She’s been homeless for over 12 years for reasons I resist to probe because our ad hoc coffee and tea meetings are merely for idle chats about radio programmes and the city of Oxford. I believe Wendy and I are kindred spirits – we never talk about the things that bother us. She never talks about her homelessness, in fact the only time it came up in conversation was on our first meeting when I asked her a little about herself and told her a little about me. I always feel better after our coffee chats. I know she appreciates having someone to talk to and I do too. Our talks are one of the medicines for my soul.” Leah’s story is not unique, there are many people that suffer in silence but there is help available through organisations such as MIND, who do a brilliant and amazing job to help people make choices about accessing mental health treatment, understanding your mental health rights -especially with stigma that surrounds this illness. MIND also work with people to reach out to sources of support in your local area.",2017

Happiness Is Not A State Of Mind,"I felt bad for him, but it was more than that. Upon further reflection, I noticed that my sense of grief for this stranger was worse than the thought of someone spending their whole adult life living in relative poverty as a pizza delivery person. My emotional reaction seemed odd and unfair. Furthermore, if I imagined someone raised in abject poverty in some third world country moving to America to deliver pizzas and live in an apartment, I kind of felt happy at that thought. My emotional reaction to these three individuals (one real, two hypothetical) did not reflect my attitude toward their current station in life, as each one shared the same state — living with little money in an unpromising career. Rather, my emotional reaction was clearly a response to each individual’s trajectory. In fact, I would argue that whether people feel happy or sad is mostly determined by their movement along a trajectory, as opposed to existing in a particular mindset. In other words, how you feel is not a state of mind. Habituation refers to an organism’s tendency to feel less, physically and/or emotionally, in response to more exposure to a stimulus. We can habituate to negative stimuli, and indeed this forms the basis of exposure therapy for anxiety problems in therapy. If one has a spider phobia, psychologists can systematically expose the person to spiders (ex: pictures, videos, real spiders) and eventually with more exposure, the person will feel less anxiety. This is not a response limited to the negative things in life. We habituate to pleasure and positive emotional states as well. Eat pizza every day for a week and you will enjoy it less on the 7th day than you did on the 1st day. This habituation applies to everything positive in life — the excitement of dating someone new, the new house you bought, video games, etc. In other words, emotional states are not possible to chronically maintain over time. They wax and wane in response to life events. It is well known in clinical psychology that sadness occurs when we lose something of value. The more valuable the loss, the most sadness we feel. The loss could be of an object, a person (ex: death), a relationship, an emotion (ex: hope), etc. The opposite of sadness is happiness, and thus happiness occurs when we gain something of value. Like its counterpart sadness, happiness occurs when we gain an object, person (ex: a new baby), relationship, emotion (ex: hope), etc. Notice that the cause of these emotional states are shifts or changes from the status quo. Life is moving along according to trajectory A, and then there is an upward (gain) or downward (loss) shift that becomes trajectory B. Habituation is the flattening of a trajectory. It takes our upward or downward slopes and flattens them so that we feel less. One question that might be asked at this point is the following — if we can habituate to emotions, couldn’t we just expose people to negative things to treat depression? The answer is partly yes and no. The ‘yes’ comes from excellent research showing that having people write about the negative things in their life, including past traumas, tends to result in improvements in mood. The ‘no’ is more complicated. Leaving a clinically depressed person on their own to just write about negative things may not help, and such exposure to negative material should be done in a more organized way, such as in therapy. My primary motivation in writing this piece stems from a consistent tendency to perceive, both in therapy and society in general, people chase and expect chronic happiness. When one considers the sheer number of people taking antidepressants in the Western world, and at an unparalleled time in human history where quality of life should be at its highest, it is clear that something big is amiss. I suspect that our emotional expectations play a big role in this state of affairs. Too many people consider sadness to be abnormal and happiness to be the norm. I have personally had cases in therapy where a sizable portion of progress was made solely from helping the person change their expectations for how to feel emotions — to allow more sadness and disappointment and let go of their need to feel pleasure and happiness. Our society has an addiction problem, and as I’ve tried to outline in this article, it is neither physiologically, neurologically or psychologically possible to sustain happiness. Life presents loss and gain, and with those experiences come the shifts in emotional trajectory. This is normal. We can try to minimize the length of our sad periods, but please note that feeling sad and being without pleasure are necessary conditions for eventually feeling happy and pleasurable states. In fact, if you want to maximize pleasure and happiness, use sadness and deprivation to your advantage. For example, if you really want to enjoy pizza, ice cream or sex, extend the amount of time without experiencing these things, and your experience of them will be heightened when you invite them back into your life. Some of the most unhappy people are those who constantly chase happiness and pleasure. They keep hitting that dopamine release in the brain through shopping, sex, food, being liked, and so forth — which ultimately pushes higher the threshold needed for enjoyment. An ever increasing slope or trajectory is required to feel good. Rather than chase happiness and pleasure, which are short-lived states, I would recommend people focus on more broad-based emotions (ex: mood stability across time) and quality of life. Living with a sense of purpose(s) provides a framework that makes us less reliant on day-to-day emotional states, and more concerned with where our lives are moving, and consequently who we are becoming as people. By letting go of the need to feel and sustain happiness, you are ironically more likely feel it in the future.",2017
All the Times I’ve Called 911,"Snakes, Serial Killers, and Panic Attacks A few years ago, I heard a news story about a woman who called 911 at McDonald’s because they were out of chicken nuggets. Don’t you just love the internet? I’m going to find the article now so you know I’m not making this up. Holy shit, she called three times! And here’s what she told police: “This is an emergency. If I would have known they didn’t have McNuggets, I wouldn’t have given my money, and now she wants to give me a McDouble, but I don’t want one. This is an emergency.” I can’t say I blame her. I mean, who wants a McDouble, right? Unluckily for you, you can’t Google my 911 stories to verify, so you’ll just have to take my word for it. Let’s see if i can remember them all. “Hello, yes, um, I’m a single mother and it’s just me and my ten year old daughter, and there’s a snake in my house. Oh my god, it just went behind the refrigerator!!!! Will you send someone right away?” Two deputies arrived a few minutes later. One slid the refrigerator out from the wall, the other grabbed the snake by its neck, walked outside, and threw it back in my yard. It was only a black snake. Thanks, deputies. “Hello, yes, it’s me again. I think a serial killer is knocking on the side of my house with an ice-pick of some sort.” The sheriff and a couple of deputies (thankfully not the deputies who “took care” of the snake) spent about ten minutes scoping my yard with flashlights. Terrified the killer had escaped, I watched their light beams crisscross through the trees in my yard praying they would apprehend him. Turns out it was just the bathroom exhaust fan on the roof, spinning round and round. Oops. I think that’s all? All joking aside, panic attacks are tricky bastards. They don’t manifest in the same way every time which makes it difficult to know when you’re in the middle of one, if it is, in fact, a panic attack or you’re actually having a heart attack or some other lethal event. The term “panic attack” is used so widely misused, some people may think it’s simply feeling a touch of anxiety. For example, “ I almost had a panic attack when McDonald’s ran out of chicken nuggets.” Uhhhh…no, you didn’t. So once you’ve had a panic attack, it should be easy to tell when you’re having another one, right? Absolutely not. Since panic attacks never feel exactly the same, the irrational part of your brain tells you, Maybe this time it really is a heart attack. Maybe this time you really are going insane. And every single time, you feel like death is imminent. Oh, and to make them suck even more, panic attacks occur out of the blue, like an unexpected house guest who doesn’t just knock, but kicks down the goddamn door. And just when you thought you had the house to yourself. I can’t say that I’ll never call 911 again, but I do know for certain it won’t have anything to do with chicken nuggets. Well, unless I choke on one which is entirely possible, but then someone else would have to call for me. Peace, K",2017
On sleep anxiety,"I suffer from sleep anxiety. Believe me, I wish I was making this up. What this means is that I worry that I won’t be able to fall asleep. And this in itself leads to a cascade of other fears: If I don’t fall asleep then maybe I’ll become an insomniac who dies of fatigue, OR fall asleep at the wheel OR fall asleep in the lab…an endless list. It started when I was 15, and I am 30 now. It seems ludicrous that I’ve lived half my life with a fear that would probably never occur to anyone to have, just because sleep is such a natural thing. This has been one of my most unrelenting phobias. And it had gained control over my life for the most part. For years every waking minute was spent agonising in fear that come night time, I may not be able to fall asleep. But then I always ended up falling asleep. And the irony is I have never experienced drawn-out insomnia. In fact in the 15 years of this fearful state, I’ve never had a single night when I haven’t been able to at least get some sleep. At most I’ve had 100 nights spread over 15 years, when I’ve tossed and turned till 3 or 4 am. So yes, it does make me sad that so much time has been invested into trying to escape this phantom. Escape it how, you ask? Well, by daily rituals. It is well known in my circle that I hardly do late nights out. I have a very specific bed time. And I never used to indulge in coffee, even though I often craved it just from its smell. My convenient excuse was that because my parents didn’t drink coffee (which was true), that I just didn’t either. Decaff was the most I would do. I remember once settling on my couch to drink a cup of tea I’d just brewed, only for it to occur to me that it might contain caffeine. A frantic Google search ensued, and once I discovered it did in fact contain trace caffeine, down the drain it went. This was 9pm and too close to my bed time to take a risk. In fact, staying out late till 9pm would induce a panic in me. I just had to be home to get ready for bed. Then I would pray and pray that I would be able to sleep. Then the moment I woke up, I’d worry for the night to come. Every.single.day. For the past 15 years. There was this notion of balance in my head: ‘Day is for work, and night is for sleep. Anything else is wrong.’ And no matter how many insomniacs I spoke to who were unbothered by their situation or who had it under control for the most part, I couldn’t bring myself to release the fear of eventually becoming one, and what I imagined the horrendous consequences could be thereafter. The lack of control was wholly disconcerting. And apparently there are some others who feel the same way. In fact, as far back as 2001 (which was the same year my sleep anxiety started) someone had already shared their concerns online (which I only found in 2015.) So ashamed was I of this very unusual phobia, that speaking about it has always been hard for me. Acknowledging it out loud made me feel abnormal. But there is nothing else to lose at this point, and only healing and comfort to find. And it is always relieving to read from others who share this phobia, even though as of posting no one seems to have found a solution. At least there is a sense of not being alone in the grasp of this particular fear. As of now it has eased up some, and I have better coping mechanisms. I’ve even been able to get some late nights out. But I have not been able to fully rid myself of it. Bed time is not the best time for me. On hectic days I still feel as shaken as I did as a teen. I know why it started. And for years I hoped for a miracle cure. Now I know this is impractical. And this is what I’m realising about various mental hardships I struggle with: I may never be fully cured but I can still live a fulfilled and successful life. Yes I have low lows, but what I’m interested in is finding hope and new ways to cope. I’m also accepting that being ‘high functioning’ may likely be what has stopped me from seeking help for so many years. As the pressure in my work life mounts, along with the realisation that I do need to pursue help, so does my anxiety. So there is no conclusion to this episode. But boy does it feel good to just let it all out. And perhaps now some of my friends and acquaintances will gain insight into why I hardly hang out late on the weekend.",2017
Founder’s advice for managing anxiety in 2017,"My personal laws of productivity that highly reduced my stress levels.BTW: I write about things related to software quality in Codacy’s blog. Check out our ebook: the ultimate guide of code reviews. During the year of 2016 I reflected a lot on my personal performance and how to better my output. I read a number of books on personal improvement, procrastination and managing the anxiety of a overflowing todo list. This is my compilation of things that have worked for me. I follow this almost religiously. 1Every morning have coffee and eat something. Many times I found the temptation of just rushing through my todo list and not eat anything or drink coffee. This is sacred. Without this, you don’t execute as well. This is also your ‘me’ time. 2Plan your tasks in the morning. Knowing what you will do this day is the most important thing. Many tasks will come from the previous day, many will appear in my head as I go to work. But writing them down in a notebook or in a document is important so they are somewhere and not in my head.There are several questions I use to prioritise my tasks for the day: This becomes auto pilot after a while where you become much more selective in the tasks that you execute. 3As soon as you start, you need to finish: it is very common to leave tasks incomplete or to start tasks that become much harder than predicted. One of the greatest books on productivity that I read recently was the martian. In the book, the left behind astronaut takes a very disciplined approach to problem solving. He has tons of problems threatening his life at any moment. But for every problem he: By doing this, over time he builds on a foundation of finished things of having a large set of incomplete tasks (that would inevitable kill him). By ‘finish’, I mean: reaching something deliverable for you or your team. After I finish a task, I ask myself: 4Do it NOW: for most important tasks in our todos, the best time to finished them was yesterday. The second best time is now. Now you already know this. However, what I have found is that by doing most things now instead of planning and burdening your future self with the work you get wins which compound nicely over time. There are many reasons why you want to postpone doing a task later: However, in practice most tasks are in fact much easier than they initially appear. Here’s a simple framework to get shit done: Divide and conquer. Done. 5Don’t deviate from that task because other tasks are appearing: I used to work with a colleague in college that when interrupted he would always say: “Just a minute, I’m finishing something” He would invariable finish his task before talking to me even if it took 1 hour. It always struck my as rude and odd why he would say that and not talk to me. It wasn’t until years later that I saw the importance of negating interruptions and not deviating from finishing tasks. In software engineering this is particularly important because interruptions that cause context switching will incur in significant loss of productivity. So here’s how I deal with unrelated tasks: If it’s a meeting, an email, a question, a call: write, schedule and continue. If you don’t write and schedule your head will bear the burden of those tasks and it will affect your current tasks. If for some reason this task is more important that your previous one (if it causes now anxiety), backtrack your head into decision why the first task was important. That’s what requires your focus. My problem solving is not multithreaded. Knowing this has helped me tremendously. 6Worst than a bad decision is no decision: many times we’re faced with complex problems that can take some time to solve. Many times you don’t have the data points to completely make a perfect decision. I find it better to ship an imperfect decision (assuming I gave my best finding that solution) that delaying that decision many times. It is more comfortable to wait. You’ll have more data points in the future. However, there’s no progress in waiting. If you can’t decide on what to do: These are a few thoughts to remember while you’re getting shit done that are particularly helpful to me: Fix things as you see them. Don’t get used to broken shit. We deal with hard by decomposing into easy. Live and breath. Everyone has fears, insecurities, anxieties and frustrations. Even then, why should be afraid of it anyway. ⚔ ⚔ ⚔",2017
Winter is my favorite!,"I love winter. It’s easily the best season. Don’t argue with me on this. However, it can also be challenging for several reasons: the shorter days, the colder temperatures, the holidays, etc. For me, though, I think the toughest part of this time of year is having to drive in bad weather. It’s frustrating and unavoidable. I need to go places nearly everyday, and if I’m not driving, I’m a passenger in someone else’s car. Being able to look back and appreciate what I’ve been through on the road, though, is definitely a positive. Each scary drive is an opportunity to learn about myself. Each time I reflect, it reminds me I’m still here. Roughly 13 years ago, I wound up stuck in a standstill traffic jam on a highway in the dead of night, right before Christmas, in rural Kentucky. In four hours of literally being parked on the interstate, ten inches of snow and two inches of ice came down on my car. When the jack-knifed semi that caused the jam was finally cleared away, driving into a white void sleep-deprived and unfamiliar with the area was awful. It would have been bad for anyone, but as someone with an anxiety disorder, it was exponentially more terrifying. Fortunately, I didn’t get stranded, or in an accident, but my mind did; over, and over, and over. I remember my hands, neck, and shoulders aching for days after that ordeal. I can still feel it. Last month, we had our first deep freeze in Denver. The temperatures fell below zero, and the snow started falling much earlier than anticipated. I found myself alone in my car, again at night, trying to maneuver my way home on roads that hadn’t yet been plowed. I drove, clutching the steering wheel, while watching cars around me slide out of control in slow motion. I couldn’t see the lines on the highway. Everything was eerily quiet and the lights glowed in that magical way they do when snow falls. Again, I found myself pointedly attempting to breathe beyond my chest, stretching my fingers and pushing my shoulders away from my ears. I remember how the snow and ice began to freeze on my windshield, praying that the section I could still peek through wouldn’t become obstructed. I made it home safely, but I wasn’t able to fall asleep for hours, because despite my body being utterly exhausted from all the adrenaline, my mind was still stuck on what could have happened. Once again, even though it didn’t, it could have. The following night, I had to be on the road again (I KNOW), but this time, I opted to carpool with others. There were five of us in the vehicle; I wasn’t driving. I’d actually told one of my friends that I was nervous about the excursion beforehand, and he asked me how he could help, but at the time, I didn’t know. I just told him I might need to talk, or need a hug, or be reminded to breathe. When we were all climbing into the SUV at the end of the night to return home, the anxiety hit me like a bolt of lightning as I was crawling into the backseat. My mind was telling me that I needed to speak up, tell my friend I needed him to sit next to me, but my anxiety told me it would be too embarrassing. Sadly, I listened to the anxiety. While the roads were better on this particular night (compared to the night before), they still weren’t great. There were lit up signs over the highway, warning drivers that roads were icy, and to go slowly. Every time we passed under one of those signs, I felt more panicky. Every time a giant pickup truck flew by, my heart raced just a little faster. By the time we reached the halfway point, I had fully succumbed to a panic attack. I cried silently, I dug my fingernails into my palms. I tapped my toes, alternating between my left and right feet, trying to focus on the rhythm. I tried with every ounce of energy in me to remain unnoticed. I was the prey, and the drive had become my predator. It was then that the girl sitting next to me leaned over and took my hand. I wish I could say it took all the fear out of my body, but it didn’t. However, it did let me know I wasn’t alone. It pushed my shame back and reminded me that my illness was not an overreaction. I wasn’t making a plea for attention. She knew, and she helped. When we finally got back to the parking lot where we’d all met, I practically fell out of the vehicle once it stopped. All of my sounds escaped from my mouth. I started sobbing. My breathing quickly became hitched. The apologies started spewing forth. And everyone in that car came together in that moment and took care of me. I was loved and calmed by people - most of whom barely knew me. They waited for me to come down enough so that I could actually get in my own car and drive home, and eventually I did. And yes, again, I made it home safely. I don’t know if these feelings manifested after that first drive back in Kentucky over a decade ago, or if it really matters. What is important, though, is that I continue to learn that admitting my fears isn’t shameful. Letting people know I have anxiety is a brave act. Asking for help is always OK. And through all this, I still love the winter. Especially during the day. Especially when I’m not in the car. Drive safely, for fuck’s sake.",2017
This Never Felt Like Home,"The search continues… Today is the last day I’ll see this view. The last day I’ll step out on this balcony. I thought this was it. When I packed up my bags months ago, packed up my daughter’s stuff with it, I thought it would be the last time for a long time. I was wrong. It wasn’t home. It never felt like home. The smell wasn’t right. The hallways weren’t right. The walk from Queen street to my apartment was too far. The building management sucked. I wonder how I could have made such a poor decision. Was Queen street screaming to me that loudly? With it’s bars and cafes and cool shops and thrift stores? With it’s dozen art galleries all in walking distance, markets on every corner, small theatres and great food? It’s roar made me do something I never do in any other aspect of my life — settle. Me, settling. Could you believe it? That’s not me, not ever. Yet that’s exactly what I did. I try to make sense of it sometimes. It was August 23 and I still hadn’t signed a new lease. My daughter still wasn’t registered in school and time was ticking. I needed to do something. I needed to make a decision. So I did. I told myself I had no choice. Something had to give. But as soon as I put my name on that lease, I felt sick to my stomach. Not figuratively, I mean I literally felt nauseous. My body’s way of telling me I fucked up. Then I tried to make it work. Ignored all of my extincts and told myself this was for the best. I couldn’t even fool myself. Now it’s time to retreat. Mistakes are pointless if you don’t learn the lesson. The lesson is pointless if you don’t apply it to your next decision. I’ve learned my lesson. The search for home continues. Queen Street, we will meet again… Thanks for reading. These pictures are real (in case you were wondering.) I know now that “home” is just as much a feeling as it is a physical space. I’m still working on that finding that feeling.

Mobile Eye-Tracking System Can Help Detect Anxiety In Children,"Treating children with mental problems is a huge challenge because they might not be able to realize the problem and describe the symptoms. This holds true even for problems like anxiety and fear which are common in children. So it calls for better and advanced diagnosis and treatment procedures for children apparently suffering from conditions like anxiety and fear. A recent study by the Penn State and funded by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) tried to look at emerging evidence of a possible link between fearfulness and anxiety or lingering apprehension in young children. The study is a continuation of earlier research funded by Penn State’s Center for Online Innovation in Learning (COIL). Findings from their previous study had shown that early fearfulness, when accompanied with an elevated attention to threat, can lead to subsequent social withdrawal or anxiety symptoms as the child grows. Speaking about earlier findings, Pérez-Edgar, who also runs the Penn State University’s Cognition, Affect, and Temperament Lab, said, “The initial COIL-funded study showed that we can capture children’s attention as they navigate their environments.” “For our new study, we’ll be testing a larger sample utilizing a more advanced mobile eye-tracking system to capture eye-gaze information,” Pérez-Edgar added. Mobile eye-tracking system A mobile eye-tracking system looks like a visor with a camera attached. It records eye tracking information (where a person is looking and for how long) via an infrared light and optical sensors. The eye-tracker is connected to a wireless tablet computer which is kept inside the backpack worn by the child. From there, it keeps sending information to a computer so that researchers can view live footage of what the child was viewing at the moment. With the red dot, which is the exact point of the child’s gaze, the researchers can see what the child is fixated on along with the duration. The eye-tracking system is supposed to be used during episodes designed to elicit fearful behavior of the child in social and non-social settings. The best phase to utilize the service of this eye-tracking system is on kindergarten-aged children as during this time they typically experience the onset of anxiety disorders, and where social withdrawal is more apparent for fearful children. “The children will come into the lab for two short visits, once alone and once with an unfamiliar peer. We will use episodes from the Laboratory Temperament Assessment Battery, a well-established, standardized protocol tailored for assessing fearful temperament in preschool children,” Pérez-Edgar said. Speaking about the utilitarian quality of the mobile eye-tracking technology, Pérez-Edgar said that it can be used for a broader spectrum of disorders like autism and can be used for real-time monitoring of social interaction in intervention settings. “We are pushing for transparency and keeping our research data accessible. We believe our work has the potential to impact a broad range of research across disciplines and is part of the process in keeping science moving forward,” he said. Dealing with anxiety disorder An anxiety disorder may be the most common mental problem among people, but it is also manageable with timely intervention. However, if procrastinated, symptoms may exacerbate and render it difficult during treatment. Hence, one should go for treatment as early as possible. If a loved one is suffering from anxiety disorder and you are scouting for treatment centers, contact the Texas Anxiety Treatment Help.

The story 99% of people don’t know about me,"For the majority of my life I have experienced a deep feeling of inferiority. Most of what I believed about myself wasn’t rational either. I would get mostly A’s, I had girlfriends, and I was an extremely competitive athlete. But, for whatever reason, I couldn’t shake it my lack of confidence. At 13, I competed at the National level of Trampoline. One event that year I competed in an under 17 category made up of 15, 16 and 17 year olds. I finished 9th in Canada! I’m sure you would agree this is a significant accomplishment… Well I didn’t. 9th place to me meant that I was no good. I quit trampoline forever that year because I was embarrassed and never believed in myself. Fast forward to high school, my own self-talk led to a downward spiral. My lack of belief in my abilities became my crutch not to try. I gave up sports, academics, and interacting with a good group of friends. I actually started spending a lot of time alone and abusing drugs. Sleeping in, smoking weed and skipping class became my pattern. 16 years old was the darkest time of my life. With few real friends, I felt like I couldn’t talk to anyone. I was overwhelmed by a deep feeling of depression and anxiety. I want to stop for a moment… I know some of you may be thinking “That’s it? A competitive athlete lost in competition and had some negative self talk? ….. Boo-fuckin’-hoo, man. Give me a break”…. To that I’d say, in moments of negativity, it’s SO easy to blow things out of proportion, to get lost in the story you tell yourself, and to identify with negative self-talk. On the other hand, if you can relate to my story because you’ve either experienced similar thoughts and feelings or are currently going through a cycle of depression know that it will get better. You and I can change our thoughts and the direction of our lives. You could be reading this thinking to yourself, he doesn’t know the half of what I’ve been through. And you’d be right. But here’s a sober reminder — Oprah Winfrey gave birth at 14 and lost her child. Nelson Mandela served in jail for 27 years only to become the first black president of South Africa. Beethoven was DEAF, yet created some of the most beautiful symphonies in history. We all have the power to overcome seemingly impossible circumstances. And as interesting as it would be to say there was one defining moment that changed my life, that would be trite and dishonest. The truth is — you don’t change years of negative circumstances in a moment. Jim Rohn described my path to change best, “You cannot change the destination of your life overnight, but you can change your direction” Candidly, I believe my change in direction can be an example for a lot of youth. I am not saying that anything can replace the expertise of a professional. Depression is something to take seriously and I can say from personal experience that was my first step to overcoming my circumstances. I am however saying that depression, anxiety and a whole host of other mental health challenges can be minimized and CONQUERED. My change in direction has led me to a version of myself that I couldn’t be more proud of. I see myself today as a confident and driven leader. In the last 3 years alone I’ve operated a business to over $100,000 in top line ARR (annual re-occurring revenues). Competed in business and speaking competitions that I could never have imagined at 16 I would have won, but did. And on January 1st 2017, I was officially part of the 3% of applicants across Canada accepted into this years cohort of Venture for Canada. In the next post I’m going to share the 3 pillars of growth that made all the difference for me. Thanks for reading. Thanks for taking the time to get to know me and where I’ve come from. If you’re battling depression, know that the best thing you can do is to talk about it. Leave a comment or email me at mrjfandrews@gmail.com (I will answer everyone) and I’m more than happy to help in anyway I can. Till then, stay on offence. Aggressively pursue a better version of yourself. And remember what Jim Rohn said, “You cannot change the destination of your life overnight, but you can change your direction”. - J Out.",2017
The Day Anxiety Ruled Me,It’s finally become apparent that I need help. I cannot continue to pretend that everything is ok and come up with the same excuses everytime anxiety flares up and I’m unable to carry on my life as normal. I thought that once I admitted I had a problem that I would feel better almost like a weight had been lifted off my shoulders but that’s not the case at all. I feel that I have been strong for so long that now I will be deemed to be weak and someone that everyone has to walk on eggshells around me. I know this is all part of the stigma around Mental Illnesses and this will eventually subside but right now I’m just at the beginning of my journey and everything is still very dark. I’m hoping that by having this blog I can start to document my thoughts and feelings that are sometimes to hard to speak out loud. But at this very moment in time the only feeling I have is that Anxiety sucks!,2017
I am afraid,I am always thinking about consequences. What will happen if… I have to consider every possibility. I am always afraid of missing the point or choosing the wrong option. Making decisions is really difficult. I have a major fear of missing out. I am afraid of writing about my feelings even under a pseudonym I created specifically to write about my feelings and thoughts that I’m too afraid to write about under my real name. Maybe I just don’t know how to write about my feelings. At least I started writing something. Good enough for today.,2017
Today.,I have this feeling inside me that keeps me from being happy. Sometimes it’s really strong and other times not as much. Today was a difficult day. I spent the whole day being unproductive. I feel shitty about so many things. I feel shitty about my hair. I feel like I’ve gained too much weight. I feel like my job sucks. I just don’t what the point of my life or just life in general is. All I really want is to go home and sleep forever so I don’t ever have to deal with life again.,2017
Who Rescued Who?,"It seems like a never ending battle — no matter what I do to ED, no matter how much I ignore him or how much I do to distract myself, ED knows where I’m vulnerable and uses that against me. And every time I fall, I can’t help but to beat myself up for it and use that as an excuse to use poor eating behaviors. I wish I could say that was it — just eating. But my anxiety has heightened and I am having trouble sleeping. The only positive out of this is that being home for half a semester enabled me to be far more open with myself and my family regarding my needs and what is going through my mind — which had been my number one negative behavior that pushed my disorders to take control. For example, being home in the fall semester means the biggest food related holiday in the American culture — Thanksgiving — which to this day is still a nightmare for me to even think about. In my big Italian family, you can bet that our eyes are bigger than our stomachs and we cook enough food for every civilian that lived in a 30 mile radius. Along with that, my family celebrates BIG for Christmas Eve and Christmas Day — both with huge gatherings for breakfast and dinner. Lastly, my family had the opportunity to go on vacation (for once!) to my favorite place on Earth — Disney!! While here for a week, we had reservations for dinner nearly every night, two of which had set menus of what would be served to us, which of course lead my anxiety to bombard me with “You’re not going to want anything they are serving” “What if there are fear foods?” “Your whole family is here — don’t mess up” — you get the picture. For each individual situation from Thanksgiving to Christmas to Disney, I made it clear to my mom that I was becoming uncomfortable to the point where I did not even want to leave my bed. Together, we came up with solutions: Thanksgiving we made sure there was a variety of vegetables and salads and proteins that I could choose depending on my anxiety as I sat down, Christmas breakfasts I made sure I ate something before that I knew I was comfortable eating and for dinner my mom made a delicious salad to which I just added chicken to make sure I was getting protein, and at Disney I always checked the menu before hand to go through and pick out what I knew was safe for myself mentally to eat. But with eating well during those tough times, the negative and obsessive thoughts always came back fighting saying that since I cheated and ate well, the following days I have to follow ED’s rules until I deserved to have some normality again, which meant no water, no breakfast, maybe lunch if I was lucky and a small portion of dinner. And this is the place where I always fall back. As much as I love when all of you help me as much as you can by eating meals with me and hanging out with me post meals to ensure I’m ok, the following days are always garbage — restriction, purging, diuretics, running until I physically fall over, whatever it may be, the relapse always happens. — — — — — Yet here is a happy start to an end (?)! In November when I left school to help myself, I expressed to my mom how lonely I felt and how all my free time was being consumed by my thoughts. The only solution we could think of was going to shelters and donating blankets and playing with the dogs. Soon enough, I fell in love with the thought of having a dog again so I BEGGED my mom for days to take me to Friends of Freddie’s Animal Rescue in Middle Island, NY. The second we walked into this huge place, my whole family dispersed to find a dog for the house, but I had no trouble. No more than six feet into the door, this little white fluff was sitting in a cage by herself and I spent the next four hours playing with her through a cage. The rest of my family refused to take “the rat” home so they kept looking but if you know me, I am very persistent. I played with this little pup for roughly two hours in a pen by myself while my parents and sisters kept looking. Eventually they bring this sad looking dog forward who apparently is never even taken out by families — and “Mother Theresa” Loretta nearly cried and adopted him for the family because “he spoke to her”. But my parents, seeing actual tears leave my eyes because of how attached I got to my little pup, decided to adopt two dogs that day — 1y/o Owen our psychotic Dachshund Chihuahua mix and 2m/o Queenie my precious little American Eskimo puppy. I am absolutely obsessed with my pup, she’s spunky yet so well behaved and just such a good puppy. It sounds super cliche but you become like a parent to the puppy and that’s how Queenie and I are, I take care of her and she returns the favor with endless love, which always means she is with me 24/7 and if I’m not with her, she apparently wanders around like she’s missing something (which is actually so cute because she’ll run to my bedroom door and try to find me). And now this is where she comes into play with my recovery. Taking care and loving her is teaching me to take care of myself and love myself. When we adopted Queenie, she had such a horrible case of pneumonia for a pup that she is still recovering from it today. She is on plenty of antibiotics but some weeks she seems sicker than before — but she’s a tough cookie and she bounces back. And I know one day soon, she will be healthy! She is teaching me that, yeah sure I was really sick and I’m still sick, but I’m trying to get better and I’m doing all that I can so that one day, I will no longer be sick. At her sickest, the doctors told us she might lose her appetite and might just sleep all day, and I would cry — because nothing is worse than seeing something so sick that they don’t eat and lay down all day; and sick enough, that’s what I would do. So every morning, bright and early, I’d sit on the floor with Queenie and feed her food, one piece at a time, until she would finish at least a small handful. And again at noon, and again at night. It was heartbreaking! At one point, Queenie had to stay in the veterinary hospital for two days and I cried like a babbling fool in the vet’s office. I could only imagine how my mom felt every time I went to the hospital or every time I’d try to get away with throwing food out, or spitting it out, or cutting food into minuscule pieces and push it around. I hurt my mom, I know for a fact, and I definitely know that she let me adopt Queenie because she knew that the pup would help me break my habits. So, in an effort to do that, Queenie and I are eating our meals together, breakfast, lunch and dinner. And when she and I go out for a walk and she gets her “post potty treat”, I’ll grab a snack for myself too. To help myself remember to take my medication, she’ll take her antibiotics the same time I’ll take mine. This dog could be saving my life for all I know, and I’ve never been more grateful. My dad got me a sticker for my car that says “Who Rescued Who?” with a little paw print on it for Christmas. All I can say is we rescued each other. Poor thing was so disgustingly sick and so was I, but here I am — starting a lovely life journey together with this goofy puppy. Of course, thanks for unconditional love and support! xo Oh and a P.S. I adore this dog so much of course we needed matching holiday sweaters ;)",2017
Why the Pursuit of Happiness Should Really Be the Pursuit of Meaning,"The story left out of the happiness frenzy Emily Esfahani Smith is a writer whose work on relationships, psychology, and culture has appeared in the Wall Street Journal, New York Times, The Atlantic, Time, and more. She is the author of the new book, The Power of Meaning: Crafting a Life That Matters, and also works as a columnist for The New Criterion. Recently, she joined Heleo’s Editorial Director Panio Gianopoulos for a Heleo Conversation on why crafting meaning is more helpful than finding happiness, why sadness isn’t a bad thing, and why coherence and storytelling are crucial aspects of building our own sense of meaning. Panio: You take the somewhat provocative stance that chasing happiness actually makes people unhappy. I say “somewhat” because anyone who’s actually chased happiness has found that it does lead to unhappiness. Why is that? What’s the science behind why the chase makes people unhappy? Emily: There have been a number of studies showing that when you bring people into the lab and ask them to actively try to make themselves happy, or if you manipulate them to value happiness, that they ultimately end up feeling less happy than people who you don’t [do this to]. I think there’s a number of reasons for it. One is that in a culture such as ours, people expect to be happy. They want to be happy. They’re told constantly that happiness will lead to all these benefits. You’ll be healthier. You’ll be better-liked. Your career will be more successful. And when people fall short of [that expectation], they’re disappointed. The other thing that the research has clearly shown is that what actually makes people happy isn’t prioritizing happiness itself, but rather pursuing meaningful endeavors, like relationships and goals and purposes. When you pursue meaningful endeavors, ultimately you’ll feel happier down the road. It’s not that happiness is bad and that the pursuit of happiness is bad. It’s that when we make happiness such a focus of our lives, we end up getting distracted from the things that actually make us feel a deeper sense of well being. medium.com Panio: So happiness is an accidental byproduct of some other pursuit — in this case, the pursuit of meaning? Emily: Yes, I think that the research shows it is a byproduct of the pursuit of meaning. Panio: Happiness is a fascinating topic. As you mention in your book, it’s grown [exponentially] as an industry since Martin Seligman started the field of Positive Psychology. Emily: Yes. Panio: So my question is — and it might be naïve, but here goes — what’s wrong with being sad? It seems just a fundamental part of our existence. Emily: I love that question. That question is part of the reason why I wrote my book. As I started getting more involved in Positive Psychology, I noticed that everywhere you turn, there are articles and books about how you should be happier, why you should be happier. And I noticed that there were a lot of people, including myself, who are just going through life. We don’t feel happy all the time. We’re experiencing difficult emotions. We’re devoting ourselves to goals that are stressful and effortful and frustrating. Yet, we’re leading good lives. They’re meaningful lives. This happiness frenzy, I thought, was leaving that story out — that you can be experiencing difficult emotions and negative emotions and still be leading a worthwhile life. To your point about sadness, all of the emotions that we experience have a purpose. Sadness, in particular, helps us step back and reflect on our lives, take stock of what’s happened to us. That’s valuable if you want to lead a good life. It helps you gain wisdom and perspective. “When you look at the research and surveys about meaning and life, there are four themes that come up again and again: belonging, purpose, storytelling, and transcendence.” Panio: One of the most traditional ways for people to find meaning in their life is through spirituality, whether it’s organized religion or some personalized version. Do you think that’s fundamental to finding meaning? Is there a way to do it without that? Emily: I think the question of meaning is ultimately a spiritual question if you’re defining spirituality as the area of life that’s concerned with ultimate things, ultimate concerns. Meaning and spirituality go hand and in hand. That said, I don’t think that you necessarily need to be a religious person or have faith or even believe in God in order to find meaning in life. One of the aims of my book was to understand how people find meaning — both with and without religion. When you ask people what makes their life meaningful or when you look at the research and surveys about meaning and life, there are four themes that come up again and again in what people talk about. I broadly categorize the themes as a sense of belonging, a sense of purpose, storytelling (or understanding your life as a coherent whole), and finally, experience as a transcendence. You can certainly have those four pillars of meaning within a religious context. If you think about why religion gives people such a deep sense of meaning, it’s because those four pillars are present, though you could experience them outside of religion, just in your ordinary day to day life. Panio: Of the four [pillars], is there one that’s most important? Emily: Different people are going to lean on different pillars. On my website, I created a little quiz to help people figure out your pillar of meaning, what’s the most important pillar for you. When I take it, it tends to be transcendence. When my editors and colleagues at Crown Publishing took it, a lot of them got storytelling. In surveys and in research, when we ask people what are your most important sources of meaning in life, they tend to say “my close relationships, my children, the people that I love.” For those people, a sense of belonging is going to be one of the more important pillars. Panio: I’m curious how storytelling is a pillar of meaning. Does that mean the way you tell your own life? “People who think that their lives are coherent, not random occurrences, tend to feel like their lives are more meaningful. The way you get to coherence is by storytelling, both about your life and also listening to other people’s stories.” Emily: This pillar was actually, in a lot of ways, the most unexpected for me. It was the hardest chapter for me to write, trying to figure out the role of storytelling in a meaningful way. Storytelling is all about how we make sense of our experiences, sense making — another word for it is meaning making. So I turned to research. I found that people who actively try to make sense of their life experiences by weaving them into a narrative that explains who they are and where they came from ultimately feel like their lives are more meaningful. The reason is that one of the components of the psychological definition of meaning is a sense of coherence. People who think that their lives are coherent, not random occurrences, tend to feel like their lives are more meaningful. The way you get to coherence is by storytelling, both about your life and also listening to other people’s stories. Those stories help you understand other people better and yourself better. Panio: One especially interesting idea you bring up is that trauma doesn’t have to be something that just guts you, that leaves you destroyed. It’s a means of growth as well — which isn’t commonly discussed. Could you talk a little bit about post-traumatic growth? Emily: Yes. Have you seen the movie Manchester by the Sea? Panio: Not yet. Emily: I saw it over the holidays. It’s a wonderful movie. It is extremely sad. It’s basically about this man who has a very traumatic thing happen to him. Afterwards, he’s kind of broken, a shell of the person that he used to be. As we talked about earlier, it’s important to experience emotions like sadness, especially after traumatic experiences. It’s okay to feel sad and broken and devastated. I think that the film, and so much of our popular culture, paints this picture of trauma as a shattering. That’s one part of the story, but it’s not the only story. In fact, more people grow after their traumatic experiences than experience post-traumatic stress disorder. The way they grow is by relying on these pillars of meaning. For example, they realize after a traumatic experience that their relationships are much more important — in fact, their relationship are what helps them get through the traumatic experience. To give another example, if they actively sit down and try to write about the traumatic experience for as little as 15 minutes a day for 3 to 4 days, research shows that they ultimately heal more effectively. They’re able to overcome the trauma because that writing process helps them make sense of the traumatic experience, and helps them create a narrative around it. In those two cases, a sense of belonging and storytelling help people grow. Panio: That ties into the concept of resilience, and how even though there is a genetic component to it, it’s not a fixed trait. It’s something that we can develop. Emily: One of my favorite examples of this is a study where researchers brought people into a lab and stressed them out by telling them they had to do a public speaking assignment very soon thereafter. Obviously, their physiological indicators spiked — [heart rate elevated. etc.]. So they told the participants, instead of thinking of this speech task as a threat, think of it as an opportunity. Think of it as a challenge that you’re able to overcome. Once they reframed the tasks for them as a less threatening and more something that they could do, [the participants] just put their minds to it. And they ended up being more resilient as measured by how quickly their physiology was able to return to the baseline level. Panio: That’s amazing. Literally, the event was no different. It’s just the perception of it. Emily: Exactly. It’s so much about framing and developing the right kind of meaning mindset. medium.com Panio: Putting [the search for meaning] in historical context, in the 60’s, a majority of college students said that their primary goal [for getting a college education] was the pursuit of meaning or a meaningful life. Nowadays, I don’t think a lot of people consider college or academia a place to pursue meaning anymore. Why do you think that there’s been a shift in the culture? Is it because academia can’t teach that? “In the last 10 years, there’s been a shift again in the universities. Professors are starting to offer classes about how to lead a meaningful life. Students are responding, because there’s a yearning for it.” Emily: There’s a wonderful book that talks about some of these ideas called Education’s End by a Yale professor named Anthony Kronman. He writes about how traditionally, in the United States, the role of college was to help young people think deeply about the big questions of life: “How do I lead a meaningful life? What is a good life? What is my relationship to the bigger world? How can I contribute to others?” Over the last 100 years, this traditional purpose of the university, of the college, has transformed. He says this is for two reasons. One is the rise of the research university, which made this question seem almost amateurish and dilettante-ish. Researchers were suddenly more interested in studying and measuring very specific things. Questions of meaning just seemed big and vague and unimportant, compared to the more scientific questions that researchers were studying. The second thing he talks about is how it became almost politically incorrect to talk about meaning, because you were relying on traditional authorities — writers, novelists, philosophers. It didn’t seem as acceptable to kind of rely on those authorities to help students figure out what the meaning of their lives is. I think there’s also a third reason, which is just economic. College is so incredibly expensive now. Students feel an imperative to use college as an opportunity to get a good career, so they’re more likely to study business or economics or what have you, and that’s totally understandable. The sad thing, though, is that young adult years, emerging adulthood, is a really important time to figure out what your purpose is and what you want to do. Students don’t really have a venue to do that anymore. More and more of them aren’t turning to religion, which is a more traditional source. And now college, which could have been where they thought about this, is also a place where it’s not being discussed as much. It’s a real loss. At the same time, I’ve noticed that in the last 10 years, there’s been a shift again in the university towards addressing these issues. Professors are starting to offer classes about how to lead a meaningful life. Students are responding, because there’s a yearning for it. That’s been a recent positive development. Panio: I think everyone has dealt with this question of the purpose of life, what’s our meaning, why am I here. So what was it that compelled you personally to research and write an entire book about it? Emily: You’re absolutely right — this is the question that we all think about. Maybe I started thinking about it from a younger age than others because of the nature of my childhood. I grew up in a Sufi meeting house that my parents administered. Sufism is a school of mysticism that’s associated with Islam. Twice a week, sufis, these seekers, would come over to our home and they would meditate for several hours in the evening. Part of their practice was loving kindness and service. The whole point of what they were doing was to diminish their sense of self, their ego, so that they could feel closer to god or the alternate reality that they were trying to grow closer to. I was surrounded by people who were leading very meaningful lives, and for whom the question of meaning had some clear answers. That stayed with me. As I grew older, I began to explore in psychology and philosophy to see if there are ways that you could still lead a meaningful life regardless of whether you had a serious spiritual or religious practice. That took me, ultimately, to this field of positive psychology. Within positive psychology, a new body of research had started to grow up around this distinction between meaning and happiness, which is a distinction that’s thousands of years old — it has existed in philosophy for a long time, but now is starting to get an empirical backbone behind it. When I saw these studies, I thought they were intriguing, because as a former student of philosophy, I had always thought the goal is to lead a good life, to figure out what a good life is. I had collapsed the ideas of meaning and happiness as both parts of a good life. As I got into the research, I thought that maybe meaning is really what we should be pursuing since the pursuit of happiness can lead us astray, and we all ultimately want to lead meaningful lives. Panio: Your subtitle is “Crafting a life that matters.” Crafting, to me, sounds very hands-on and do-it-yourself, as opposed to “finding” a life that matters, or “discovering” it. I’m sure that was a very intentional choice — a lot of this can be done, enacted. Emily: Exactly. I wrote about Aristotle in the introduction. He thought that a meaningful life, a flourishing life, is an active life. I certainly found that as I interviewed people and turned to the research. There’s a misconception in our culture that meaning and purpose are something that you find. It’s something that just kind of happens to you, that hits you over the head. Once you discover what your meaning and purpose is, you’ll be set for life. Actually, every day there are innumerable opportunities to find meaning within your life. They’re at our fingertips, whether we realize it or not. They’re all around us. We find deeper fulfillment by seeking them out. That’s an active task. This conversation has been edited and condensed.

Naming has Power: How Moomintroll helped my anxiety disorder,"At the age of six I had recurring nightmares about my house being on fire. In these dreams my dog would save me from the flames; I don’t remember that detail, but my parents assure me that’s what I told them at the time. The dreams — along with my general nervous attitude toward life — brought me to a child psychologist, and that started a lifetime of therapy and appointments that resulted in a diagnosis of OCD and GAD in my mid-twenties. Four years on, I’m starting to get a handle on it, and a lot of it is down to one fabulous tip: name your voices. Spoiler: this doesn’t work for everyone and may even harm people with some disorders, and is certainly not a replacement for getting actual psychological help. Despite that, I can’t stress enough how much it helped me. If you think it might help you, please bring it up with your therapist. Now back to my story. I don’t remember where I first encountered this idea. It seemed a bit bonkers the first time, actually, so I glossed over it and moved on. However, my current (fabulous) therapist suggested naming the negative/anxious/catastrophising voices in my head, so I nodded dutifully and went home to think about it. I realised something: it always helps me to name a problem. Hiding behind a vague sense of unease doesn’t do anything, and denial doesn’t last indefinitely. Naming my problems with ritualised walking and compulsive thinking as OCD took away the power, leaving me much more ready to fight. No, I’m not a weirdo (well, not JUST a weirdo) who couldn’t walk across a bridge without an anxiety attack, I had a thing separate from my personal identity that was making things more difficult. Naming the anxious impulses and voices has a similar result for me. When my anxiety levels rise, I freeze: I cannot function on a basic level, even enough to answer questions directly asked of me. I can’t figure out how to get the words out, and god forbid someone ask me to make a decision in that state. If you find me at my worst I’ll probably be curled up in the corner of my living room, tucked up in my cushions avoiding eye contact and desperately trying to get out a word or two. It’s not fun, but the freezing metaphor gave me the idea for a name. The Groke. Have you heard of The Groke? She’s a large, looming ‘monster’ in Tove Jansson’s Moomintroll series. She freezes everything she touches and never speaks. Horrifying at first, you soon come to feel compassion for the creature when you realise all she wants is to be warm, but she will never succeed. If you wonder how on Earth such a morbid idea helps me, you probably haven’t met me. Let me explain why it works for me: when The Groke comes, everything freezes. She is silent, just as I am when anxiety hits. Yet The Groke (in her role as my anxiety) is only trying to help. She wants to be warm and safe, and this is how she thinks she will achieve it: by freezing me. When I was a child I grew up around very volatile people. I was never certain whether I would meet a smile or a shout, and I was often shamed for giving the ‘wrong’ reaction in a situation I had no control over. As a result, I have an extreme delay in emotional reactions to things that I’m only just getting under control. The Groke (as my anxiety) attempted to keep me safe by freezing my reactions until I was somewhere safe. Very sensible when I was a child, yes, but not too useful as an adult. Because of this, and because I named the nebulous concept, I can respond to it in a healthier way than the self-sabotage that used to be my go-to. Now I can look The Groke in the metaphorical eye and thank her for trying to protect me, but remind her that freezing me isn’t going to help. I am already safe. This lets me have compassion for a side to myself that I used to fight and hate, and anything that reduces the conflict helps in the long run. Naming the anxiety voices in my mind brings them under better (if not yet perfect) control. It is one defense of many against anxiety disorders and is not a foolproof solution, but if the idea appeals to you, bring it up with your therapist. It could make a world of difference — just as it did for me.",2017
Who Else Wants to Learn About Treatment for Anxiety Disorder?,"Anxiety disorders aren’t all treated the exact same, and it’s important to fix the particular problem before embarking on a plan of treatment. In the event the reason for the anxiety is a physical ailment, treatment is going to be designed to get rid of the specific ailment. Much like any Dual Diagnosis, finding the most suitable treatment can be challenging. This sort of disorder is a severe mental illness. There are many forms of anxiety disorders with a range of symptoms. Anxiety disorders are usually resulting from composite of psychological, physical, and genetic aspects, and treatment is, generally speaking, very powerful. If you quit taking medication, your symptoms will most likely return total force. If you’re pregnant, under all kinds of medication or have any sort of disease, you have to consult a doctor prior to taking any of the medicines above. In some cases, it may be treated at home, without a doctor’s supervision. In some ways there isn’t any such thing as a very best treatment. Often, as soon as an individual with an anxiety disorder seeks help, they aren’t treated in the best way. If worry or fear infiltrates every facet of your living and everyday schedule, you could have severe anxiety. Among the most critical therapy modalities for anxiety is psychotherapy. The very best therapy for anxiety is certainly cognitive behavioral therapy. Several kinds of psychological treatments are designed especially for treating patients with PTSD. Anxiety disorder is extremely treatable. They tend to run in families. Get as much information as possible in regards to the anxiety disorder you’re diagnosed with. While it can look like there’s not a thing you can do about the signs of social anxiety disorder or social phobia, in fact, there are various things that may help. Anxiety is more than merely a feeling. It is the result of fear. Feelings of anxiety can grow to be a larger health concern whenever the symptoms turn into excessive and persist indefinitely, cause emotional distress or whenever the symptoms begin to interfere with normal activities of day-to-day living. Perhaps due to this, those who have anxiety problems normally do not come for treatment. In its normal state, it is an important human coping mechanism. The Best Treatment for Anxiety Disorder It’s a genuine medical disorder which requires long-term therapy and a long-term commitment by a caring owner. Social anxiety treatment demands a nurturing, balanced atmosphere. Sometimes, therapy alone is effective in cutting your anxiety symptoms and receiving your everyday living back to usual.",2017
[565] Lights Camera Cut!,"[565] Lights, Camera, Cut! One of my favorite things to think about is the media. We talk a lot about how much we’re saturated to the point that we’re strangled and cut off from what it used to mean to be human. We say that the Golden Age of television is bringing us world class art from all walks of life and allowing for voices to be represented that never were before. We don’t really know what to feel about it all because it moves quickly and everything about how we develop is slow and reactionary. We at the very least think that it speaks to the ever-obscure idea of “we.” I’ve criticized the idea of “we” before. I usually state that “we” don’t do shit, and that it’s a small group of intentioned or riled-up individuals who enact changes with sometimes lasting consequences. “We” is often the scapegoat for when we didn’t show up or put in the work. That’s “we’s” psychological utility. You know it pretty explicitly with your experience towards sports or maybe your allegiance to school or perhaps you’re fairly patriotic and subconsciously have really taken in the ooo-rahs and chest beating of your native country. The mystics and homeopaths take it a step further and transform the we into things like a “collective conscious” that gets all sorts of powers as it gets “raised” or wishes hard enough. In areas of moral ambiguity we rely on we. It doesn’t have to be asked where the behavior came from or why it started, we’re all doing it, so it’s cool. One of my favorite observations of monkeys was them training new members in their group not to do something that no monkey in that current group ever experienced first hand. Say they’d get shocked trying to climb a ladder to grab some bananas. The first group sees the brave monkey get hurt enough times, spreads the word, it’s now common knowledge. Slowly remove the monkeys that know and replace them with one’s that don’t, sooner or later, before a new monkey even tries to climb the ladder, the others will step up and slap him down. When you think about the evolutionary origins of man and the endless amount of experiences species go through, it’s a marvel that we ever coalesce into relative agreement at all. Me begrudging “we” when no two brains look alike but for the physical properties of the matter they consist of seems inadequate by itself. Of course, when and where there’s reason to celebrate what “we’ve” accomplished, we should. It’s shared goals that brought us our largest wonders of the world and allowed us to explore what’s beyond it. And it’s right there you come up against the important ingredient for whether or not “we” succeeds or fails. You have to have a goal. Despite what motivational posters or inspirational memes might try to allude to, a goal in and of itself isn’t de facto a good thing. The angry tea-bagger’s goal was to get you to suck on their angry nuts, and we’re sucking away. The goal of the whole movement that “looked past” the magnificent show of bigotry, hatred, and incoherence was to appease their nerves and ideas precisely like a child will scream…and scream…and scream…until someone engages it. A constant refrain in the news right now is that democrats have “lost touch” with the “regular people.” One might muse about their increasing coziness with lobbying groups, or their smug bubbles of the kind of entitlement those happy white family shows that go on for way longer than anyone understands why. They’re goal simply had little to do with a “we” that actually included those who felt they could play the game. — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — —  TV absolutely fascinates me. I don’t see just wildly creative and nuanced depictions of life in every episode. I don’t go through the best kind of existential crises that allow me to celebrate while reevaluate all of the fictional influences in my world or how they mock up against the real people in my life. It fascinates me because I want to keep watching. I want to see thousands of people come together and tell a story. I want to see fundamental truths about what it is to exist get filtered through Police-Doc-Lawyer-Firefighter drama. I want to see bravery in the face of dragons, murderers, and pregnancy tests. I want to see someone reliably do just what I knew they were gonna do, and I want to be shocked when they deviate. Before it’s some medium that seemingly secludes and depresses us, it’s a story box. Maybe the problem with TV is less to do with there being too much of it, but that there’s nothing else available instead of it. It’s filling an immense cultural void. It’s a void I constantly talk about in my angry finger-pointing about friends not pulling together to create their own show. How could they? Who’s buying them the cameras, the lights, the food, coordinating the rehearsal dates, schooling the children, keeping sets clean and consistent and out of the hands of crazies and thieves? Who’s the actual job creator and not just the brazen figure-head credited with endless empty lip-service? That’s always who I wanted to be. It is my base desire to set the conditions, if I often fail at the standard, and watch the show of my dreams play out. And I’ve been absolutely stuck for what feels like forever. I’ve been trying to understand what it means to be a “high anxiety” type of person. Like, I know I’m cool, but I’ve never been the cool kid so to speak. Those people who’s blood-pressure you might take while their house is burning down and while their heart pumps at an even 45 they use the flames to light a cigarette. Not me. I’m cursing myself for not having bought insurance and then the line of circumstances that ensured I never really had the money to buy insurance, even if I did, but it’s a predatory industry, and the one time I tried it bled me dry and yada yada yada my brain takes off. That lack of cool though has never really held me back. I’m not afraid to stand up for myself, even if being a large and tall person helps. I take calculated risks like trying to run the coffee stand, or get 100 kids drunk under my roof, or spend the cash to buy land and figure out how to build a house. I keep making the inappropriate jokes, dance like no one’s watching, karaoke the fuck out of songs I don’t know. I whip my Deva Curled hair back and forth and I’ve ran around naked in public on more than a few occasions. You never get to see how slow or fast my heart is beating. If I am in fact a high anxiety type person, it shouldn’t or doesn’t matter. That is, until now. Now I caught the feedback loop of anxiety about my plans and future and tied it to my cheater method of obtaining cash. Now, because my day to day is endless lounging and binging I have nothing that rips my mind away from my next screening appointment or thoughts about disaster back-up plans when I can’t get it under control. In the most important sense the stress, the danger, and the consequences are all as fake for me as they are for a character about to get eaten by a dinosaur, but you’ll watch someone get chased and worry about them every time even if you’ve seen the movie and know dinosaurs don’t exist. My brain doesn’t care. It’s reliving the drama of the first episode of “Nerves” like it’s stuck on repeat and someone locked the door to leave. In that way, my brain fascinates me as much as any TV show might. Why are you watching? There’s a significant argument that says I don’t really have a choice. I don’t begrudge myself for the amount of media I consume because the alternatives are to freeze, wander around, or adopt any of the behaviors one might associate with the awkward loner guy who’s way too into conversing with you at the bar. I try to put in a fair amount of caveats when I’m harping on you to change something about whatever life you lead for analogous reasons. The difference is the imagination for the goal of alternatives. Certainly there are actors that take roles to keep the bills paid. The millions of terrible movies you’ve never heard of that exist for that reason, and it’s why you get to make fun of “tough guys” from a classic blockbuster who appeared overseas hocking candy in a colorful outfit. It wasn’t a discussion about whether the role would help them understand themselves or inspire other thespians. It’s still a business, you gotta eat. The problem is thinking of yourself in purely business terms. You can’t just be a commodity to be priced and dressed and positioned for some insidiously obscure notion of “maximum effect.” By all means feed yourself, but keep going to auditions because you know there are rolls that we will talk about for as long as we survive. Right now, my story may involve delivering pizzas or learning to be a bank teller. I may stock shelves or wash pets. I need to keep the bills paid, and if my brain wants to watch a stupid show instead of let me walk in and pick up a check for a few thousand and move on, then so be it. In my imaginary world where I get to create elaborate sets and cast brilliant inspiring people, I never wrote that it would happen without the montage of everything demeaning and distracting in between. The main character can be relatable for any number of reasons, but who says the negative aspects won’t prove to be the most compelling? And really, it’s no more or less frustrating than the last forever years I’ve been resigned to my television screens. I know the story I want to tell. I know my goal isn’t malicious or nearly as naïve as any singular profession or decision I make in service to it might suggest. I know how expensive it is to buy all the cameras and how much time it takes to set up the lights. The rest of the crew, cast, writers and producers though, seem to be on strike. Why would they want to watch my show? What about it couldn’t they pull themselves away from? It’s not even paying the bills. I have a lot to prove. I still need to be much bigger and louder than I’ve ever been. What I expect out of myself will never die donning the “wrong” outfit getting paid more and less than anyone ever deserves. It won’t taste any less sweet in my thirties than if I get it by next year. People won’t need it any less whether they feel too old already or haven’t gotten here yet. And I want to be able to feel the sense of pride and accomplishment that any show-runner must have to create a hundred episodes of something you think is absolutely terrible. Without that mission, that shared conception and goal, we’re not even extras, as “extra” implies there was enough of something there to begin with. Anyone got a better show in mind than mine? via Blogger http://ift.tt/2imUDc0 January 06, 2017 at 11:32PM",2017
Panic Attacks: The Layman’s Guide,"So once you’ve had a panic attack, it should be easy to tell when you’re having another one, right? Absolutely not. Since panic attacks never feel EXACTLY the same, the irrational part of your brain tells you, Maybe this time it really is a heart attack. Maybe this time you really are going insane. Maybe this time you are dying. Oh, and to make them suck even more, panic attacks occur OUT OF THE BLUE. You’re just standing in your kitchen or driving down the road feeling all normal, and WHAM! Like an unexpected house guest who kicks down the door instead of just knocking politely. And just when you thought you had the house to yourself. This is an edited segment from a previously published, much longer story about all the times I’ve called 911.",2017
Living with Separation Anxiety,"I’m seventeen, and I have separation anxiety. Separation anxiety is a form of anxiety normally expressed by infants or small children when separated from their parents or a familiar place. For me, it works pretty much like any form of anxiety, creating an unnecessary state of worry or panic. I was seven when my father was accused of child molestation. I was nine with he was found guilty. Finding her golden, and perhaps her only, opportunity escape from an abusive, manipulative relationship, my mom walked away from our $700,000 home, leaving the Chrysler 300 and RV sitting in the garage. She packed every one of my belongings into a 30-foot Deckover, leaving behind all of her own, and drove 1,700 miles to our new home. This experience no longer traumatizes me, though I did have a lot of restless nights and misleading phone conversations with my deadbeat father. The only thing I’m left with is a crippling separation anxiety. I’ve always been close to my mom. She did her best to protect me from the hazardous situation that was her shattered marriage, but perhaps I had become too attached to her. The first signs of my anxiety started as soon as we got settled. I slept in her bed every night for at least 3 years, terrified that my father would somehow get out of prison and come for her with a vengeance, as he had promised. I can only remember a handful of times that I’ve stayed over at a friend’s house, and at least a dozen where I tried to stay the night somewhere and ended up calling my mom at 1am to come pick me up. As I grew into a teenager, I started to notice that none of my friends were as close to their parents as I was with mine. People who know us well envy our close relationship, gushing about how they wish they had the same relationship with their mother or daughter. It had always been normal to me. I mean, why would I stay out all night when I had my own bed to sleep in? I had accepted that I needed to seek professional help when I began staying up all night figuring how many years I had left with my mother before her death. 30, at most? Of those years, I would be only be living with her for another 3 before I would leave for college. Not to mention the years of smoking before she had me. Would that effect her lifespan? Or what if it’s tragically cut short? This became like a sick game. Every moment I spent with her felt like the last one. During the day, I wouldn’t think much of my anxiety, but as soon as darkness fell, it was like an axe, picking at the back of my mind. The guilt is the most crippling part of the disorder. I’d stay up at night regretting copping that attitude with her, or not telling her goodnight before I went to bed. I thought about everything she did for me, and how ‘horribly’ I had treated her as a daughter. I never helped her with housework, and I spent all of her money. She never asked for help, and assured me that the bills were adult problems, but the anxiety was crippling. Some nights I would stay up worrying until I saw the sunrise through my window. Some days I stayed in bed until the late afternoon. My freshman and sophomore years of high school I attended online. At the time, I thought I was doing it because I didn’t like my local high school. Little did I know, it would only be feeding into the disorder. In this time, I went with my mom to work every day, and I scarcely left the house otherwise. My anxiety not only kept me from being away from my mom long, but from being away from home long. My social circle had become very small, consisting only of a few close family members and friends. If nothing else, I learned a lot about myself in these two years. As I progressed into my late teen years, I noticed a lot of new symptoms. I earned my driver’s license and my mom bought me my first car. Between both of our jobs and my new group of friends as I returned to public school, we were like two ships passing in the night. I would see her in the mornings before school and at night when I got home, sometimes after she had gone to bed. She always gave me plenty of freedom to do my own thing and manage my own life, which gave me a new-found, exhilarating independence. But of course, whenever I was away I felt guilty for not being home, and when I was home I felt guilty for not being out. The problem got so bad, I would either cancel plans with friends, or beg to be dropped off early. With years of practice, I finally learned how to manage my anxiety. After I had identified that it was a problem only in my head, and not in real life, it was easier to assure myself that there was no reason to panic. Every time I started to panic, I would assure myself that my mom would not likely be dying anytime soon, and that I shouldn’t feel guilty for events that she likely doesn’t even remember taking place. Of course this won’t work for all forms of anxiety, but objectifying the problem and reminding myself that it was a mental illness made it a lot easier to defuse my panic. I’ll have to live with my anxiety, likely for the rest of my life. I still have nights where the devastating thought of losing my mother resurfaces, but once I learned to live with my anxiety, progressing in life became a piece of cake. As I go to college this fall, I’m sure I’ll have a lot of sleepless nights and hysteric drives home. But the road ahead looks brighter as I learn more about myself. I know that I’ll be able to make it through, as I always have.",2017
In Transit,"I woke up screaming up the other night. The second time in the past few weeks. The sound of my own voice brought me out of my dreamscape, a rope tied around my waist pulling me back to the present. As I slowly awoke, I felt the echoes of my scream reverberating around the room. I wondered if the next door neighbors heard me. S immediately grabbed me and clutched me as the mist of the real world solidified around me. I began to remember who I was and where I was. “Oh my god, are you okay? What happened?” I paused. My heartbeat was moving at an uncomfortably rapid pace and I wanted it to slow down. My throat was dry and I needed water. But my body felt heavy, unable to move. “I-I don’t know…, I think I was about to die,” I whispered. And it was true. The memories of what took place were fuzzy at best. The setting wasn’t all too different from my past dreams. Often times I walked through a corridor, a home, a building trying to get somewhere else, trying to get to my ultimate destination. In transit, at the airport or waiting at a bus stop. Sometimes I was on the run. The uniting thread was that I never really got to wherever I was trying to get to. An obstacle always emerged. A missed flight, the wrong bus, finding myself to wander in cities and spaces that looked familiar but their layouts were unbeknownst to me. But this time, there was an ominous entity in the background. Something that I was trying to escape but only had a limited amount of time to do so. I found myself in an elevator shaft of an industrial building and knew my time had run out. With dread coiling around my body, I felt Death began to envelop me. I screamed. And I returned. Coming back for air from the depths of the inky universe I plunged into every night. Awake. Alive. Breathing. A second incarnation of sorts. The following essay is Essay 1 from the #52essays2017 challenge inspired by Vanessa Martir, an amazing writer I met last year during my time at VONA 2016.

A Blood-Red Portrait in Relief,"Walking towards my home, I encounter a weapon. I cannot say of what type, but suffice it to say it merits fear and great respect. I’m unsure as to why I am lifting the weapon off the pavement, or placing it beneath my coat, only it is done, and I’m speeding home, paranoia turned to 10. I’m standing just inside my door, the lights are off, the silhouette of the television framed by the light of the window behind it. Stunned silence permeates the room, rendering my body stoic and statuesque. My shoes scuff the floor, and I end up at my bedside where I deposit the weapon by a lazy drop. It tumbles and bounces a couple times. I lift the quilt to prevent it from bouncing off the bed. TV on. Bedclothes applied. Mixed drink in hand. I’m watching The Master, a film by Paul Thomas Anderson. It’s on because I have only recently seen my very first Paul Thomas Anderson film, There Will Be Blood, for which Daniel Day-Lewis earned an Oscar for his patient and arresting performance. Eyelids flutter, and I’m seeing Joaquin Phoenix doing odd things, like faux-fucking a woman made of sand. With the remote so close to me, I could very easily turn it off and spend a relaxing evening asleep, with not so much as a sound besides the intermittent rush of cars down my street. Instead, I remain motionless, entranced by slow cannabis-induced exhaustion, and a stream of oddball images. I place my drink to the side and drowse. The cat is scratching at the door. there are streams streams streams streams streams of gray the spectrum of black and white and gray streams streams streams streams streams cascading relentlessly off a barely defined cliff face the color gray, the peak the colour of steel, the base the colour of lead, the sky the colour of fog, onto a boat amidst the blue oceans, but just off the coast, clearly and vaguely in line with my own vision…no I am inside the boat. This single stream of “time” is aligned specifically broadly with other streams, one in which I am on the edge of a skyscraper, a la The Matrix. I look down, heroically, without pause, without hesitation or fear. I’m crouched and theres a crawlspace in front me. In another there is a hotel room. Ancient 19th century interior design sensibilities are ostentatiously put on display with raucous abandon. In another I’m a psychedelic’s dream, cyberpunk architecture and transport making love. Joaquin Phoenix is on screen, the director is using a close-up. His character is nervous and wound tight, gritting his teeth and chuckling, and I open the door for the cat and then close it again. Enter [stage right] the antagonist, or the lover, whichever synonym you prefer. Blonde hair, thin body, light skin, careless dress. smoker, drinker, habit-former, lover of animals and dogs. mind washed clean of morals, and spirit separated from character, no tangible connection to our idea of humankind. Early morning daylight shows its face through the cracks in the blinds over my window just above my bed. My bladder is full. In the hotel room one of my dear friends, with whom I am in no way acquainted in waking life, enters slowly, like history, and then all at once. A dog has been killed, its body lying in the corner of the middle of the floor. I know my dear friend killed it. I turn over in my quilt, with one glance at my phone. blonde lover walks in, lips red, eyes white no black, she does not see me, she guts my friend, fingers as claws slicing and screwing through him, his chest cracks, she is dowsed in blood somber reflection at great height, streams streams streams of gold and red and white and blue, painting the sun with extravagant strokes, careless and ready. a walking body, shapeless and hapless, strides across my vision, dead animal beside, the lover who is my lover drips amorphously from the rim and the soul of the sunset into perfect semblance, moving forwards and backwards in an instant, melting slowly and then traversing reality instantaneously. She ends beside his hazy form, and her fingers are blades, bright and sharp and flowing, and his body is inside out and outside in and his blood a fine mist like the base of a waterfall, and the sound of it is nonexistent and forceful. I’ve removed the weapon from the confines of my quilt and deposited it upon the floor. The metal responds against the wood floor with an almost inaudible thud. The sun is higher, the foggy morning blue has dissipated into a warm midmorning glow. I turn the TV off. I feel as though I’m walking along a path from the back to the front of the boat’s cabin, but inhabiting the entire line all at once. My vision is arrested by a view through a window, a woman standing over a man who I cannot see, and she’s gutting him like a fish. I see and feel and fear this exchange for the sparest of seconds it inhabits, but continuously like a looping tape recorder or a skipping record. It’s over in an instant and dragging on for eternity. The feeling wells up inside me, morphs and transmutes into physical understanding, his/my spinal column is being caressed by a vice, our guts are being splayed open, and an eruption of blood, magmatic in its form, sashays into view. I turn and run, head racing heart pounding, feet swimming across the floor as if I’m levitating, I reach the door … I’m holding the weapon in one hand as I douse my face in water with the other, glancing at the clock then at the bathroom mirror, batting my lashes to disperse the tiny pearlescent droplets. I wipe my face with a towel, the weapons cold steel gently caresses my cheek. I blanch and then notice the invitation scrawled invisibly on its menacing form. It slowly winds it’s way down my face, brushing my neck, tapping my collar bone, conversing with my wrist. It holds there for seconds…minutes…for a moment. I steady my breathing and close my eyes. I’m imagining the cybernetic spaces my future inhabits, the dark underbelly life that my soul finds solace in, with grit and grime glued to the inside of my vision. Neon signs and electric wires dance effortlessly and sinuously and spark and FLASHFLASHFLASH — gasp Blood traverses my arm with a measured flow, dripping onto the white carpet beneath my feet. It forms a portrait in relief that I at once recognize and thereafter misremember, charmed by ignorance. I cannot describe it except to say that it bears a striking resemblance to whatever lies dormant inside of me, a premonition of my own discursive/recursive existence.",2017
2 Days Out. How am I feeling?,"My intention is to share my journey over the next couple of months as I fly back and forth for business. Why? I know I am far from the only person battling it out with the mind so that we are not held back from doing some pretty amazing things only reachable by plane. Hello Ireland! I want to come see you one day! So, in just a couple of days, I will be like the people in my picture, on a plane and traveling to my destination. How will I feel? What will I do? Well, I am not there yet, so I will focus on how I feel today. I have been watching a lot of videos on overcoming fear of flying. I have been reading through a book on my reader on “Flying with Confidence.” I have been listening to others share how they won the war with their own minds and put away the fear. I have even listened to others talk about how they weren’t able to overcome it, and move on. The battle in the mind is so real, so strong, and needs to be the place that is overcome in order to come away victorious. Normally I would be a basket case right now. I get twinges of nerves every once in a while, but, I am surprisingly calm. I have been leaning on Someone bigger than me to help me through, I have been educating myself on how the plane and flying actually works, I have been familiarizing myself with what all the sounds on a plane are, how that plane will get off the ground, and stay up, and all of the details. Mentally this is where I am. What about the emotional part? I have been worried about being fearful itself. What will happen if I get up there and have a panic attack? How will the staff handle me? What will others think about me freaking out? All of these things have run through my mind. I have accepted that if I do freak out, I freak out. I won’t be the first person to do it, nor the last, and I will still be on the plane when I calm down, and at the end I will still be getting off the plane with everyone else. Fear, especially fear of fear is crazy sounding I know. It is unfortunately all too real. Its a battle, mostly in the mind, but also tugging at the emotions. My goal is to wage war against it, and to come out the other side victorious. I really want to travel without having to drive everywhere. As it is now, my fear has been such a crippling mental problem that I have driven lots of excess hours just to go places, and I would rather use my vacation time enjoying my outing, not getting there and getting home. So, I am two days out from leaving, and you will hear from me again on the flip side of that flight as I share how I actually did.",2017
Advice from an Insomniac Writer,"Thousands of thoughts run rampant in my mind each day. Some inspiring, some depressing, and many random that fall in between. Over the years I’ve learned not to yield to them, yet I’m still unable to rid them (trust me, I’ve tried). I sought “praying” them away, but that didn’t go as planned. For some reason, I kept feeling the urge to write them down. So, here we are. I’m a writer — not that I chose to be one, but because I realized I am one. Ready to face my fears, over come this anxiety, and put my thoughts to good use. We writers are our own worst critics: dozens of half-written stories abandoned, tons of notebooks full of poetry too shy to read aloud, months worth of blog posts that should’ve been published as a book, continuously contributing articles to online magazines for free (Come on now, I can’t be the only one). One thing I can say is that writers always knew they’d be writers. It came natural, forming words across a page, and was somehow exhilarating. Every unexpressed emotion, verbal restriction, painful memory, dreams and ambitions, found freedom when pen touched paper. And once read by someone else, they mysteriously unlocked the confidence and creativity that a mere conversation couldn’t. And that, that is what makes writers take a leap of faith and quit their 9 to 5. So, as my insomnia sets in, and I type at 1:35 a.m., I encourage you to ask yourself what I’ve been asking myself everyday until now: What’s stopping you? I’m so glad you’ve came across and read my first (of hopefully many more) posting here on Medium. If you’ve felt motivated, able to relate, or simply liked what I wrote, please click that little “heart” on the bottom, left side! Thank you. Peace and blessings!",2017
#BigParentingIdea — Where Does Anxiety Come From?,"That’s why asking questions like “What’s wrong with today’s 20-somethings/ teenagers?” makes zero sense. It’s nothing but the previous generation’s cry for the good old days. And if the times weren’t particularly fortunate (like the Great Depression/ WWII / post-WWII) they would tell you that there was certainly something special about the social fabric back in those days, or that at least people had values. Besides, the Great Depression, WWII and post-WWII times are long gone. In newer history, except maybe for new technologies and the standard of living, everything was better when today’s adults (40-somethings through 60-somethings) were young. There were jobs, there wasn’t this much anxiety, there was job stability, people didn’t work this much and this hard, there was more spare time in which one could enjoy life, all people weren’t in such a rush, etc. I mean, all was great back in those days. And today? It’s like 90% (at least!) of what was good about life, is suddenly gone. How the hell all those young people will cope? They’re probably doomed! That’s the main problem! The world has changed and adult and old people who remember the good old days (days when everything was perfect), yearn for those good old days. And what do they do? They lament! Parents, teachers, professors and other well-meaning adults, they all pass their anxiety down to those young people. Oh, it’s terrible. More and more people find it difficult to get jobs nowadays. People can’t find jobs in their professions. People are being laid off. The time is very uncertain. And this constant stream of younger, better qualified and cheaper job candidates. Terrible! Terrible! They wish the good old days were back again. They can’t accept the fact that the world has changed dramatically and they didn’t adjust their thinking. They still think that the formula for “success” which was relevant 30 or 20 years ago is still relevant today. They’re quick to offer young adults their outdated career advice and they wonder what the heck is wrong. Why the hell those things don’t work anymore? But since they’re still locked in this old paradigm, they start to feel anxious. They don’t get it. OMG! Something must be wrong with the today’s world/ job market/ generation! they cry. What they don’t realize is that nothing’s wrong with the today’s world/ job market/ generation. Nothing. Zero. Wrong is their expectation that outdated models/ career advice will hold true in a different world. That’s precisely where the current anxiety comes from! From people wishing that outdated models still applied, because they so got used to them. People who don’t feel like adjusting to the new reality of the ever-changing world. That’s where we get this anxiety from. All those kids starting out today didn’t invent it. The current anxiety is a complete scam! Thanks for reading! If you liked this article, here’s more.

THE TRUMP DIARIES: Day 62,"A lot of people report fear after Trump was elected, and note that the fear, in some instances, is increasing: Interfering with sleep, communication, work, and relationships. Though fear can be debilitating, fear is also just about the best motivator for making change. Fear is the reason why Trump was elected. Toni Morrison notes in her magisterial essay in a recent New Yorker that many white people who voted for Trump were terrified of losing their social authority: They enjoy the double standard of justice. They will do anything, even shameful and disgusting things, in order to maintain that authority based on being white. She quotes Faulkner to describe how incest is less shameful than the murder of a black man. So those who live in fear of Trump ought to recognize that the fear is a stimulant, a natural response to a change in the environment. Take the fear as the sound of bells going off in the firehouse. It’s not too late to put out the fire.",2017
Back to writing,"Well, personal writing anyway. After two years out of freelance work, due to health issues, real job going well then badly and another child popping up, I was given the chance to write about tabletop war gaming late last year and — to my own surprise — took it. Paid writing about something I basically did to spend more time with pals not as fond of the card and board games I am addicted to was perhaps foolhardy. Yet, a few months later and a few well-received reviews and features under my belt and I’m warming to my role as the guy who writes light-hearted pieces about things that genuinely grab my interest, always with an honesty about my lack of genuine expertise. Meanwhile, my life outside of work fell apart and continues to fracture. My temper at home began to spiral out of control with the slightest issue with my children or spouse causing me to fly off the handle. At least the anger was verbal and mostly directed at myself, although some furniture in my office got hit on occasion, but there were times when I screamed at my little ones for disobeying me in a way that seems impossible for me to imagine now. Coincidentally, I had begun long term counselling at the time and it was becoming clearer that some deep rooted issue with home life was acting as a trigger for a form of panic attacks. A new diagnosis of ‘Personality Traits’ further supported this theory, especially the discovery that obsessive compulsive thoughts along the lines of “I can’t handle this”, “I never should been a parent” and so on were not normal helped me make a decision: I had to leave. My wife may have pushed me, but I was the one who decided to move back to my parents to try and clear my head and get back to normal. At least, someone whose entire days were not spent on a razor edge between doing okay and becoming a ranting maniac. For a while, all I could do was cry about the things I was losing. Then I started watching more television. I started to see family and friends who I had confided in, whose company always lifted my spirits. I began playing videogames again and fell back in love with my PS4. Then I started new medication to help boost my mood — a low dose of an anti-psychotic — and slipped into a drug-induced oblivion for a month. TBC",2017
How?,"It’s me, myself and I. But how? How did that happen? As I stare at people around me; meeting friends and family and colleagues and acquaintances and potential new loves, I wonder how is it just me? How did I become so alone? How could I let that happen to myself? How could I of stopped it? Today is all about How… People ask me all the time, ‘How was your weekend? Do anything nice?’ HOW do you tell a colleague that you spent the weekend alone, wondering who you could contact and determining that no one wanted to hear from you? How do you tell a colleague, who simply wants a ‘Yeah I had a lovely quiet weekend, thanks, how was yours?’ that while you had a quiet weekend, it was the kind of lonely soul penetrating quiet that makes you feel like you’re going mad? You don’t, you don’t know how. How do you tell people that while you’re smiling, you still feel sad? How do you stop feeling sad? How do you stop all the negative feelings and just have a good day? How? I want to have friends and loved ones and normal relationships, but how? If you have no one to teach you or show you how, how do you learn? You teach yourself; you teach yourself how.",2017
"Hello Darkness, My Old Friend","Recently, I’ve been pleased to see an increase in exposure for anxiety and other mental illnesses on mainstream social commentary and news websites from writers being more candid about what it feels like for them. Some of them I relate to, others I do not. That’s because there’s no right or wrong way to experience anxiety. I’ve been proud of these people without knowing who they are, for being honest, while sitting to the side and wavering over whether to be honest myself. I read recently that 1 in 6 people will have experienced a common mental health problem in the last week. So many of my friends and family experience this in some form, that this figure is extremely unsurprising to me. And it’s only a good thing as far as I’m concerned that mental health in this country and around the world is becoming more visible. When and why does mental health become a competition though? I used to have a friend who suffers from depression. I felt for her very strongly, and a part of me still does. But I gradually found myself struggling to sympathise with her, because she made her mental health a competition. It didn’t matter to her that I was going through a tough time as well — in her eyes, my life was better than hers so I had nothing to be upset about. It got to the point where I would actively change the subject when in conversation with other people, when I could see her getting worked up to telling them why her life was worse than theirs. I haven’t spoken to this person in a number of years. At a certain point I had to be selfish in order to continue down my own path to (relative) mental health. To people who don’t know me I can be pretty convincingly calm these days, and most of the time, I am. But when it manifests for me it feels like I’m tearing apart at the seams. During one such episode a bit over a year ago, it would take me two hours to eat my bowl of muesli and yoghurt in the morning, and then it would almost be time for lunch. Eating is a chore when all of my energy is being consumed in holding my thoughts in my head, in keeping my limbs on my body, and my heart in my chest. Because that’s what it feels like for me; like if I don’t concentrate on holding myself together, I’ll just disintegrate and there’ll be nothing left. This was an extreme episode, one that I’ve had before and will probably have again. This time I was able to pull myself out after just a week; but I’ve had them last months before. I’m lucky to have reasonable control over my anxiety. Most of the time it doesn’t affect my personal or work life; things sometimes slow down for me, but I still get them done. I struggle to relate to people, especially when there’s a lot of them but I’ve become skilled at forcing my way through my discomfort. I know there are people out there who have it a lot worse than I do. Mental health is not a competition, but I know that that is true. It’s important to me however, that people know it’s a two way street; the stats show us that just because you’re struggling doesn’t mean you’re the only one. Never dismiss someone’s pain because you feel it’s lesser than your own. You never know what is bubbling just under the surface. This post also appears on my personal blog laurareflected.",2017
Watch a No Holds Barred Nervous Breakdown in Action,"This article was originally published on TransformingStigma.com. Writing a blog post detailing a nervous breakdown was incredibly challenging for me. To get as clear as possible, I began writing it last week immediately after having a small nervous breakdown. According to the Mayo Clinic, “the term “nervous breakdown” is sometimes used to describe a stressful situation in which someone becomes temporarily unable to function normally in day-to-day life. It’s commonly understood to occur when life’s demands become physically and emotionally overwhelming. The term was frequently used in the past to cover a variety of mental disorders, but it’s used less often today. Nervous breakdown isn’t a medical term, however, nor does it indicate a specific mental illness. But that doesn’t mean it’s a normal or a healthy response to stress. A nervous breakdown may indicate an underlying mental health problem that needs attention, such as depression or anxiety. Signs of a nervous breakdown vary from person to person and depend on the underlying cause. Exactly what constitutes a nervous breakdown also varies from one culture to another. Generally, it’s understood to mean that a person is no longer able to function normally.” Through working with my therapist, I have gained insight into my own nervous breakdowns through the years. Without you being inside my brain, here is the closet that I could get to you letting you in. My breakdowns start with my internal response to certain mental health triggers: Any of the above can lead to a fireworks show of emotion in less than one second. I feel the following simultaneously: Inside of me, I move between each feeling quickly like this: Hopefully this diagram illustrates how painful and overwhelming this can be. For other people, it can be much, much worse. My actions are typically negative, toxic, or inappropriate behavior. As a child, I would explode at home (and school sometimes). This included destroying things, trying to hurt my parents, trying to hurt my younger brother, and sometimes our pets. In addition, I would cut myself to numb the pain that I was feeling. As an adult, I tend to internalize everything (to keep myself out of legal trouble) and because I don’t want to hurt anyone. However, when I’m having a nervous breakdown, I get really angry at people. For example: Sometimes a nervous breakdown can happen for a few minutes. Sometimes a nervous breakdown can happen for a months. Either way — IT SUCKS! Hopefully, I’ve given you some insight into what may be going on in the mind of someone who has regular nervous breakdowns. Every persons situation is unique, however. Maybe it’s genetics. Maybe it’s stress. Maybe we are just wired differently. Regardless, we are people. Let me know your thoughts…",2017
How do you talk to your crush?,"It’s a simple, yet profound question. It’s one many of us spend our adolescence wistfully asking ourselves, and some, many years beyond. Scouring our psyches, as if searching for the long-lost instruction manual to our minds, which might at last provide the answers to our own tumultuous feelings. How do you talk to your crush? Recently, someone asked me this very question. As a writer on sexuality, I’m a great proponent of the value of fantasies. But the trouble comes when the fantasy figure is a real person, and you’re desperate for your fantasy to come true. So this is what I know: you can not talk to your crush until you understand a fundamental aspect of your emotional self, and that is Limerence. If you’ve never heard of it, you should take a few minutes to read the entry on Wikipedia now. Then re-read it again and see how many of the symptoms you recognise. Seriously. It’s that important. Basic psychology like this should be taught in schools. Trembling, flushing, palpitations, fatigue. Awkwardness, stuttering, shyness, confusion. Insomnia, loss of appetite. All the classic symptoms of anxiety. Yet what are you being so anxious about? A crush is an intense and (as yet) unreciprocated attraction. Some might even call it an infatuation. The problem is, if you have a crush, you’ve unilaterally decided that a particular individual is The One. And now you want to talk to them. And you want them to like you too. That’s putting a lot of pressure on yourself isn’t it? You might blow it, and then The One might shun you. No wonder most people just fantasise about their crushes from afar, unwilling to risk bursting the fragile bubble of their dreams. Yet you talk to people all the time. So what’s stopping you from talking freely to this particular individual? Limerence, that’s what. So you can not talk to your crush until you recognise, and master, your own limerence. And that means confronting a fundamental home truth… Write it down as an affirmation. Pretend you’re in detention, spank your bottom and write it out a hundred times if you have to. Until you’ve properly understood that you’ve no right to expect the reaction you desire from someone else. Once you truly accept that, and stop thinking in terms of success or rejection, you’ll be less emotionally invested in the outcome of talking to this individual. After all, your conversation with them should be natural, playful and mutually enjoyable. It shouldn’t feel like you’re giving a speech entitled “Why I’m the one for you”, live on national television. The late brilliant Professor Randy Pausch liked to say that obstacles aren’t there to block you, they are tests to force you to prove yourself. Crushes are an important life lesson. They encourage us to master our own emotions, but not to the extent we become cold and distant. A crush is an essential rite of passage, an uncheatable test of your emotional maturity. To pass you must accept that The One is not an object to be desired or a trophy to be won, but an emotional being with feelings every bit as valid as yours. Someone to talk with, not a target to be talked to — only then can you truly connect. Mastering limerence is the doorway. But those who persevere will find an incredible world of authentic love lies beyond. Believe me. I’m lucky enough to know.",2017

Don’t Get Frozen by Creative Anxiety,"Creativity and anxiety have gone together hand in hand (er, pencil in hand?) skipping off into the sunset together since 40,000 years ago when cave paintings first appeared. Anxiety’s all about self-protection; creativity may have even developed because of anxiety, our ancestors using their fear to imagine creative solutions to future problems. And it still protects us, either by helping us do our best work or by preparing us for if our work doesn’t do well. Worriers are the warriors of the modern age, constantly innovating to thrive. Creative anxiety is the ultimate double-edged sword, it’s self-protective function becoming either helpful or suffocating. On the one hand, it can fuel our art. Cartoonist Gemma Correll creates super relatable (and hilarious) cartoons about her anxiety all the time. And way back when, Edward Munch painted his infamous “The Scream” after becoming overwhelmed with anxiety one day. But then there’s the other kind of creative anxiety, the hindering kind. The little negative voice in the back of your brain that hitches a ride on your creative flow, all the while pointing out the flaws in your work and whispering “Nobody’s going to like this. Are you sure you even want to put it out there? What if it fails? Not good enough not good enough not good enough.” Like Gollum talking to himself in Lord of the Rings. If creativity were a barefoot marathon, this kind of anxiety would be like stepping on a rock every other time your feet touched the ground, holding you up every time you try to move forward. A little anxiety is good for creativity; it helps us improve. But Creative anxiety also makes you your own worst judge. And judgement isn’t just telling yourself your work isn’t good enough — it’s also getting caught up in overthinking what designs you “should” make because you think they’ll sell better rather than making art you are passionate about. But as a musician friend of mine always used to say about his music, “who are you to judge your own work?” To judge our work is to judge ourselves, to try to be something we’re not. Trying to steer your creative mental stream towards what you think will appeal to others or will get you those sweet, sweet ‘likes’ just puts up damns in your creative flow. As Scott Barry Kaufman of Scientific American says: “It seems that the key to creative cognition is opening up the floodgates and letting in as much information as possible. Because you never know: sometimes the most bizarre associations can turn into the most productively creative ideas.” Look at Hamilton creator and star Lin-Manuel Miranda. On paper, a hip-hop musical about the first U.S Treasurer doesn’t sound like it ever should have taken off. But rather than let that potential anxiety stop Miranda from innovating, he kept going. Because he was passionate about it. He recently spoke at Lyric Opera in Chicago, and one thing he said really stood out to me: “You cannot do something because you think it’ll make money. You have to do it because you love it. Or you have to do it because you think you’ll learn from it.” The constant worry that your designs aren’t good enough or won’t sell can become a self-fulfilling prophecy. Pretty soon, instead of creating more art or growing your online shop or market yourself better on social media, you’re re-binging Stranger Things on Netflix for the third time rather than trying to improve. I’m a hypocrite, really. While writing this piece, I bit all my fingernails back down to stubs because my own creative anxiety was getting in my head (really, I did). But that’s the key to facing creative anxiety: don’t let it stop you from creating. With the negative Gollum voice whispering sweet negative nothings in our ear, how can we possibly judge our own work in a non-biased way? We can’t. Don’t let your anxiety judge your work before it’s even started. Some tips for pushing past anxious blockades: - Acknowledge it: Ignoring the monster in the closet doesn’t make it go away. Acknowledge your anxiety, try to pinpoint the cause, maybe write down what you’re worried about to get it out of your head. Then you can work on what’s making you anxious and move on. - Go outside: Or just away from your work. Sometimes the best thing to do is to free-write or draw whatever you want to work on, then walk away from it for awhile and come back with fresh eyes. - Unplug: It’s amazing how effective turning off your phone, taking out your headphones, and removing distractions can be. Clear your mind. - Read or listen to podcasts: Sometimes reading or discovering something new can inspire you to create something by freeing up the creative flow your anxiety blocked up. Don’t let anxiety hold you back from selling your art. Open an anxiety-free Artist Shop!

"I Have Anxiety, So What?","More often than not, when you refuse to acknowledge something that has a clear effect on the way you live your life, it only makes it worse in the long run. If you suffer from mental illness and refuse not only to accept that you are “ill” but also avoid seeking treatment, you’ll potentially only do more harm than good, right? Well, what if that wasn’t always the case? What if, specifically people who suffer from anxiety disorders, could actually benefit from refusing to accept the diagnosis and instead, make lifestyle changes that would benefit them and ease symptoms? Since we can’t solve any problems with the same level of consciousness that created them, we must take a step back and, look inside ourselves and feel where the damage is rooted. Personally, I believe anxiety is only the result of deeply rooted or compulsive thought patterns. When we focus on something other than our negative, anxious thoughts, we no longer experience anxiety, and our emotions follow along, leaving us feeling content and relaxed. At least until we shift our focus back to the anxious thought loops. So you’re saying there is nothing wrong with experiencing anxiety and panic attacks? Nothing at all actually, it’s perfectly normal. As a matter of fact, chances are that many of your friends have sometime during their lives experienced the very same thing. So there is nothing to cure? Wherever you place your focus, energy builds up. When you focus on your negative thoughts, the energy that builds up in that area is just getting stronger and stronger. And if at the same time you feel fear, an experience a panic attack will most likely follow. Well at least if you don’t break the pattern or stop fearing it. So my own paradoxical approach to anxiety disorders have been to actually convince yourself that nothing is wrong with you, because, believe it or not, you are perfectly normal. During my time as a CBT therapist, I have helped tremendous amounts of clients overcome their fears and anxieties with the very realization that they should shift their focus, and their sanity will follow. For if you focus on something being wrong with you, if you keep reading self-help books and going to a psychologist, you are just reinforcing the fact that you are ill. And that’s it really. According to psychiatrist Sadock BJ, Sadock, anxiety disorders are characterized by excessive or unrealistic worry about everyday tasks or events. In some cases, the anxiety might be specifically related to certain object or rituals. What may be a seemingly ordinary phobia to someone without anxiety, may be experienced in an entirely different way for someone with anxiety. Feelings of intense fear and distress that interrupt everyday life could be the result of an anxiety disorder. According to the National Alliance on Mental Illness, “anxiety disorders are the most common mental health concern in the United States” with approximately 40 million American adults living with an anxiety disorder. NAMI also reported that most people will begin to experience symptoms of anxiety disorder before the age of 21 and more women experience the disorder than men. Despite millions of people suffering from some form of an anxiety disorder, there are some professionals who believe anxiety disorders don’t actually qualify as mental illnesses. According to Charles Linden, creator of The Linden Method for high anxiety conditions, anxiety disorder is a behavioral condition, which is entirely different than a mental illness. Mental illnesses are conditions occurring or existing on a biological level, while, according to Linden, anxiety disorders are “caused by a ‘resetting’ of the ‘baseline’ anxiety level” which happens when the anxiety disorder is reinforced by continuous anxious thoughts. The main characteristic of panic disorder is panic attacks that sometimes occur repeatedly without warning. A panic attack can be mistaken for a heart attack because it causes intense physical symptoms like chest pain, dizziness, upset stomach, and shortness of breath. Someone with panic disorder may, over time, start to experience an overwhelming fear of having another panic attack. Not surprisingly, those feelings of panic interfere with daily tasks and a person’s overall quality of life. For someone with a phobia, specific places, events, or things cause such an intense reaction of irrational fear, they will go as far as to avoid entire situations or things. For those suffering from phobias, exposure therapy has been proven to help manage symptoms and in some cases even overcome the extreme fear experienced. Some phobias are more common than others, with certain phobias being generally easy to explain or understand. While other phobias seem entirely random or irrational. Someone with generalized anxiety disorder experiences a worry that goes beyond normal in that it’s constant and irrational. The worry they experience is so consuming; it makes it hard for the person to complete tasks or concentrate. Because of the constant feelings of anxiety, the person often experiences chronic fatigue, nausea, tension, or headaches. Social anxiety is a lot more than just being shy. Someone with social anxiety experiences intense fear or irrational concerns about being humiliated in a social situation. Someone with social anxiety disorder might avoid conversations or public events entirely, in an attempt to isolate themselves for what they perceive as safety reasons. Symptoms of a panic attack are frequently experienced by people with social anxiety disorder. If you recognize you have anxiety and attempt to overcome it, are you setting yourself up for failure by simply reinforcing the behavior? If you have anxiety disorder, are you perhaps better off finding ways to entirely ignore the anxiety itself? According to Linden, those reinforced anxious behaviors are the only cause for anxiety disorders. He stated that all the symptoms experienced, are the result of bad reactions in the brain that force your body and mind to respond inappropriately, with too much anxiety. Because anxiety disorders require different treatment than mental illnesses, pharmaceutical efforts may help, but fall short in treating the condition entirely. Psychologists and researchers, like Charles Linden, have found that anxiety disorders are more effectively treated with psychotherapy or a combination of medicine and therapy. But before you even consider seeking professional help for anxiety, could you benefit from a more unorthodox approach to symptom management? According to NAMI, symptoms of anxiety disorders include, but are not limited to feeling apprehensive, tense, or jumpy, feelings of dread, irritability or restlessness, and feeling the desire to prepare for the worst or keep an eye out for signs of danger. Physical symptoms of anxiety disorders include upset stomach, shaking, hair loss, skin flushing or blushing, frequent urination or diarrhea, racing heart, shortness of breath, sweating, twitching, headaches, fatigue, and insomnia. While medicine and therapy have been proven to help people with anxiety disorders, non-traditional approaches have proven, in many cases, to be just as effective. For some, it may be anxiety-inducing within itself to have to face their disorder, which is why an unorthodox treatment approach may be beneficial. For example, instead of facing the disorder head-on and seeking treatment with a professional, one may find meditation or other relaxation techniques effective enough on their own. Additionally, symptom management is possible through proper self-care. Self-care techniques can include changes in diet, an increase in or variation of exercise, changes in relationships, or switching up your daily routine. It’s important to understand your specific triggers in order to make the changes required for relief. It’s also vital to know that changes can’t be made overnight, so an overall improvement in your mental health in just one day isn’t realistic. Because other conditions may be related to and/or cause the symptoms that arise as a result of anxiety, some people may benefit from treating those conditions instead. They can then reap the benefits of everyday life with less anxiety. For example, conditions ranging from substance abuse to a lack of sleep can cause heightened anxiety. If you seek help for substance abuse or make sleep a bigger priority in your life, you escape ever having to focus solely on anxiety and the idea that you could be diagnosed with a mental illness. On the other hand, there’s also the idea that you could simply accept the fact that you are more prone to anxiety than others. Accepting heightened levels of anxiety and acknowledging a mental illness don’t have to go hand-in-hand. Just because you may handle stress less effectively than your peers, doesn’t have to mean a serious illness that requires treatment, right? Perhaps anxiety and your specific symptoms can be controlled entirely by your state of mind. The idea can’t be too far off given that anxiety as a whole begins in your head. In this day-and-age, stress isn’t uncommon. Unless your anxiety is so severe that your overall health is truly at risk, it may be worthwhile to try simply accepting your thoughts and behaviors, instead of being ashamed of them and wanting them to go away. Whether you turn to a book, a computer program, a new exercise program, or any other non-traditional form of relief, what truly matters is an overall feeling of wellness. And it all starts with the shift of focus.",2017
Shining a light on the difficulties of being a professor,"As students, we are constantly anxious about maintaining grades and writing midterms and finals that we sometimes forget that we aren’t the only ones that have to cope with anxiety and stress — professors do too. While reading Professor Smith’s article, I found myself starting to empathize with not just him, but my past professors as well. Intrigued about his thoughts and motivations about writing this article, I went to him to ask him some questions. Professor Smith’s motivations for writing this article were quite clear — “not everybody gets to describe the experience of teaching [such] a large class”. It’s a “unique experience” that he wanted to share with others in an honest fashion. Writing an article like this resonates with other professors and instructors, and even gives students a glimpse into the experience of lecturing for the first time, and all the anxiety that comes with it. Did you know that burnout among faculty member around the world is becoming more common? I didn’t either! Just like many of you, I was quite ignorant to the pressures and demands that are put on faculty staff on a day-to day basis. They are constantly being pulled in opposite directions, which can become hard to juggle. On one side they have their students who want them to be amazing professors, and on the other hand they have the research administration that wants them to write better papers and get more grants. Unfortunately, it has become the norm that the better researchers they are, the less they teach — and thus, they get more time to become even better researchers, which results in them earning more. This type of hierarchy, in which faculty members that teach more, earn less, and those that teach less, earn more, breeds the sense that teaching is not as important. Essentially, the demands of their two-tiered job can become a vicious tug-of-war with them right in the centre. With the faculty demanding better quality research, and the students demanding better quality teaching (on top of their own goals!) it becomes hard for staff and faculty members to manage it all, resulting in extreme stress and anxiety. The struggles with teaching are true and real, however, they are ever so rarely talked about or brought to light. Having professors like David Smith talk to us about these difficulties allows us to empathize with them. It’s very easy to become upset with others when as a student you yourself are stressed, but it is important to remember that your professors face the same problems. Next time you find yourself about to write a mean course evaluation, try and remember that they are people too! Here is a link to another article by David Smith about dealing with anxiety as a professor. If you are a staff or faculty member at a University and ever find yourself in need of support in coping with stress, or just need someone to talk to, you’ll likely find that your institute has resources in place to help, so please reach out.

A girl and a big move…,"Moving in with a boyfriend. Sounds exciting, doesn’t it? After three years of being terrified I will end up alone in a small apartment, having seen all my friends getting married and pregnant I have finally met someone I have fallen in love with and who made me smile, a lot, all the time, until my cheeks hurt. We had known each other for a few years before we went on a date we had been planning for months and months. He spent the night lying next to me, telling funny stories and holding my hand, just the right way. After the many holidays we had already booked with our friends and family, events we had already purchased tickets for before we went out, we finally had time to spend together. And it was lovely. I felt safe. I felt comfort. I felt someone understood me. All my anxieties, all my fears disappeared. After seven or eight months of absolute bliss we began talking about moving in together. We live in different cities and it had become a pain to travel back and forth to see each other, constantly sleeping in different beds, packing, unpacking, leaving… As we both have been renting for a number of years, we decided we would like to buy a property and invest the money we had. A few months later we started looking. The choice of the location was easy. The criteria were to stay close to work and close to friends. We also had a similar idea as to what the perfect house looked like and where it would be located (avoiding potential flooding and long walk to the station). It was great. Then other things happened which I may or may not disclose later, but we eventually decided to book viewings and to my total surprise found the house of our dreams on the first day of the planned viewings. I remember leaving the estate agency feeling my stomach getting into a knot but I was excited. I was thrilled. It was a huge step. The first weeks of the process I felt calm. Then when it came to deciding about the will and type of tenancy I stressed out. It hit me. These are important decisions. We are not married. We don’t have children. What if I die in a few years when our relationship is on the rocks? Why would he inherit my half of the house? May sound petty but you will understand that to someone as independent and used to depending on myself only those were massive decisions. Especially that my circumstances are a bit more complicated which I may or may not explain later. I engaged with a bunch of people who where in the know. Received lots of advice, some good, some bad. Talking about my own death had all of a sudden become just as easy as talking about lunch at Bill’s on Saturday. Strange feeling that was. And funny. Very morbid though. Actually more funny than morbid after explaining a million different possible scenarios of my extinction, including car accident or alternatively being hit by a car on the massive roundabout near the house, cancer, murder, dying in the shaft of an elevator, to the solicitors, financial advisers, and friends. Somehow all this over-analysing has triggered my anxiety. I became stressed, kept creating likely and unlikely scenarios in my head that kept me awake until late at night. I wandered the streets of my brain trying to find a solution to every problem. Impossible solution. Trying to come to terms which all the possible negative outcomes of the decision I had made. I could still sleep though. We take sleep for granted. I will tell you now — it is not given and you should cherish it while it lasts. Sleep long and deep. Go to bed early. Don’t worry about missing out on reading and Netflix. Get up at 11! Screw breakfast, you can have lunch instead. Enjoy the lovely dreams you have. Enjoy the nightmares. Smile when you’re reading a great book and you’re dosing off. You will miss it as hell when it goes away and you lie wide awake at night listening to your heartbeat and trying really heard to focus on breathing and not thinking about anything as everyone you know has avised you to. You will cry when you look at your mobile and it is already 6 am and you have not slept at all. I know what you will think — I should be excited, I am overanlysing, first world problems, just let it go, enjoy. I hear what you’re saying. However, after 31 years of constant disappointment with relationships and men, having to look after myself and my family, seeing my mother’s life torn apart by her husband, and being armed by her in fear of the same happening to me, I have become extremely scared. Some others may say I should seek therapy — maybe, or maybe not. I understand exactly what is happening to me and why. I do realise I am not being rational, however I resent the idea we need to take all our issues to the therapists office. This is hard. This is big move. This is my life that I have turning upside down and I am scared. I want to live through this unmedicated. Does he give me any reasons to be scared? Yes! Of course! I never wanted to be with a cuddly toy that doesn’t have its own opinions or life, doesn’t make mistakes, or get annoying with its obliviousness. Relationships have to be exciting and if you feel that you own your partner and no wave can rock your lovely little boat you are either delusional or you are dating a cuddly toy! So every now and then he does scare me and doesn’t behave the way I deem relationship perfect, but to compensate he helps me dry my hair, carries my suitcase at the airport, dancing with me around the kitchen, and holds my hand when I fall asleep. I am simply trying to come to terms with my changing life and the fear of the unknown. But the purpose of this blog is not to moan about how scared I am, how I have developed a server insomnia due to the stress of the decision I have made, the sadness I feel compromising my independence. I wanted to write this blog as a form of therapy. Writing has always brought me relief. I need relief. I need the knot to leave my stomach. I need the sleep to knock on my door again. Perhaps describing and laughing at some of the (actually funny when you think about it) situations and thoughts I am experiencing will allow me to calm down. I am determined to calm down. I am determined to be happy again. And get excited about this damn move, because I know it is going to be great. If you’re there, reading this, wish me luck, and keep reading…",2017
Shifty,"It’s kind of funny. My mind seems to be on a kind of track and I don’t get to be at the controls. With the exception of meditation, there’s not a lot I can do to slow the train down either. So I thought I’d write a little to explore the phenomenon. I want to write articles. I want to write full articles that have good subject matter and have proper editing and look nice and yada yada yada. But the structure needed to get that done isn’t there. Or, if it is, it isn’t something that can be done consciously yet by me. It’s just because I’ve never done it before, that’s all. Nothing more than that. But I have to keep an eye on myself, because if I’m not careful I might be asking for some anxiety. You see, my anxiety works from a sort of self-critical reflection approach. I’ll look back on time that I’ve spent doing one thing, usually leisurely, and think, “Think of what you could have done with all that time you spent doing ______!” Whatever I was doing. And every time I notice that my writing doesn’t look like a proper piece of work, or I can’t really explain my point, or the idea wasn’t going anywhere, it really starts this critical side of myself. Don’t get me wrong, for a long time it’s been helping me avoid disaster, but it’s too one-sided now. It’s not sure what to do because I don’t have a real career, and it doesn’t have any answers anymore. That is incredibly difficult for it. What I rarely need now, then, is to work through that section where I suck. And I have to deal with the anxiousness that comes with that until I don’t suck anymore. Because… I kind of do. It’s not fun to realize that the writing you’re supposed to be doing for a career path comes off as just a cluttered mess of half-formed ideas. But that’s kind of how it’s been since high school. That’s what you get for underachieving so you can have an easier high school life. You’re stuck shaking in your boots over Medium articles. So, I suppose in conclusion, I’m going to try to build a track ahead of the train of thought that I’m always having, so that at the very least I can choose the direction it’s going. If only I had a map.",2017
Inside Anxiety,"“It’s like choking on the same thing that is trying to keep you alive; tightening it’s grip while screaming “breathe, breathe!”. It’s like a million thoughts are running this race that never seems to end and you know which one will win. And you’re trying to yell out your lungs while water fills and absorbs the words that once touched your tongue, but now dissolved at the slightest taste of struggle. I try and I try and I try yet I can never seem to pinpoint the triggers because nowadays it all seems so muffled and hazy that I can’t pick out the cause of the mess in my mind. My memory is foggy, my eyes are blurred and I just need air. I need air and space and for these people to move because I feel like I’m being suffocated and these hands won’t stop touching me. I can’t seem to push forward and I’m falling back into who I was as I watch who I am supposed to be disappear with the clouds. I am struggling and fighting and yelling while the war is raging on in my mind; it only ends for moments at a time. It lets me believe I am better, that I have won, but it is all a lie. Lies, lies, lies all the time. I can’t stand it anymore, I just need to hear real words full of voice and truth and meaning because these sentences are just scribbles in front of my eyes and I can’t make them out anymore.”",2017
Is This What It Means To Be All Grown Up?,"I feel like everyone around me should be worried, why aren’t they living in an anxiety induced panic all the time like I am? How are they so gosh darn calm?! I worry. About life. Money. Friends. Family. Where I’ll be living in a year. Will I have a job? And I realise at times that I am being dramatic, those friends won’t suddenly crumble to dust if I start to consider my life path instead always bringing theirs into it as well. But there are times when I feel I am being very realistic. Especially when it comes to money, housing and a career. Money is something that starts me itching, it’s a necessity that has been scarce many times during my childhood and it keeps me awake worrying about my own. It then moves to … Should I stay where I am? Should I move out? Should I give up completely and move back in with my mum? These are all options that I battle with on a daily basis, something that gives me anxiety to consider as all hold their own terrible properties. Which in turn morphs into … The many, many news articles, talk back and Facebook posts shared seem to point towards that fact that I will not find a job in the field I studied. So was it pointless? Did I go through all of this just to work in a supermarket? I do understand that some have it worse than me and I am being quite a brat by complaining about these things, but isn’t that another perk of growing old? Complaining about anything and everything? Well, here we go, looking forward to many more years of worry, complaining and probably realising that everything isn’t as bad as I think.",2017
Anxiety Is the Monster Under My Bed,"When I opened my eyes, the light was on. I could tell it was still dark outside, but I couldn’t recognize the room around me. There was a man standing in the corner. He was featureless and completely black, like a shadow. He didn’t move. I couldn’t move. My eyes were searching around the room. I looked down and saw blood all over my hands, but I couldn’t work out where it was from. I became aware of my body being filled with an unshakeable certainty that I was going to die. To most people who have suffered from panic attacks before, this feeling of life-threatening dread will be all too familiar. Yet it remains impossible to describe to those on the outside. Sometimes it can creep up on you, swelling and swelling until you can no longer hold it in. Or it can hit you fast and hard, like a car crash. It could happen anywhere: in an elevator, in a crowded supermarket aisle, walking down the street. Every little fiber in your body is screaming, telling you to run. And sometimes, the episodes can visit you in your dreams. I’d had nightmares before, but nothing had filled me with the primal fear I had experienced in that room. Half awake, half asleep. Nothing was real. My bedroom was unfamiliar. But I experienced every little emotion, every rise and fall in terror like I was still awake. I couldn’t breathe. I was convinced something was trying to kill me. I was living by myself at the time, so I awoke crying from my panic attack at 4 A.M., alone in a cold, dark room and 200 miles away from my family. I went about the rest of my day, but I couldn’t shake the night terror from my mind. I’m not “crazy,” I have severe anxiety. I was always a creative child. Even today, I can conjure up worlds, people and situations so easily in my mind that they almost dance before my eyes. But, like a deal made with a strange witch in a fairytale wood, there’s a cost that comes with having such an overactive and often out-of-control imagination. Just as my mind can create stories full of fairies, elves and whatever else my pre-teen self was occupied with, it can also create monsters. The shadow creeping out from under my bed was a sharp-toothed clown. That noise coming from the boiler in the cupboard was a vengeful robot made of rusty tin cans with knives for hands. Some of the thoughts were understandably upsetting, like the anxiety I dealt with when my parents separated, for example. Others were so overtly ridiculous that I can’t help but laugh at them now. As a kid, I used to panic every time an ambulance drove past me on the street. I’ve heard from other people that they also jump to scary conclusions such as, “maybe it’s my loved one,” but my second thought was always “but what if I got run over by a car and I’m dead, and I just don’t know it yet?” As I grew into adulthood, the elves became lofty aspirations and the frightening clowns became an overwhelming fear of failure, amongst many other things. The anxiety has always been there, but it wasn’t until I moved into the busy metropolis of London that it became unbearable. Walking past any group of people was an impossible task. Any sound of laughter must have been at my expense. I loved my lectures, but seminars were my special idea of hell. It felt like my mind had been enveloped in one thick, grey cloud. There are always lots of thoughts constantly rushing through my mind, but I can never pick out a single one. The possibilities and opportunities that my imagination gave me were being destroyed by this dark illness, and no one seemed to understand how serious it was. One of the biggest issues about growing up with anxiety without knowing you have it is that it begins to blur the line between what is normal and what is unhealthy. It wasn’t until seeing a therapist did I realize my need to constantly present myself well was yet another physical symptom. Small quirks that have always been there, like walking with my eyes on the floor, biting my nails, and not being able to sit still meant that anxiety has partly shaped who I am as a person. But that was just the beginning. After a year in London with money troubles, arguments and difficulty adjusting, we found out that one of the most important people in my world had cancer. When I opened up to my therapist about it, he told me I was describing my trauma to him as if I was describing a chair. Anxiety had taught me to be obsessed with self-managing and hiding my emotions so well that I had literally forgotten how to feel them around other people. Looking back, I see that was the point where I began to spiral too far. The anxiety became overtly physical. It felt like I had been staring at a bright, glaring computer screen for too long, and my eyes couldn’t concentrate on one thing. I was having multiple anxiety episodes pretty much every day. For me, a panic attack begins when my neck, wrist and arms feel tingly. There are pins and needles in my legs. My whole body suddenly gets hot and I start sweating. This can happen because I got a call from an unknown number, because someone keeps sending me messages when I am already busy, or because there are suddenly too many people in an elevator. It feels like always being on the brink of tears. I can’t sit still in a meeting, my feet are constantly moving and I start picking at the skin on my finger. It feels like being sat in a restaurant, and tearing a napkin into a thousand, tiny white pieces. Like scratches on my wrist where nails have dug in too hard. Like I’ve forgotten how to take long, deep breaths. When it’s really bad, I can’t move my hands or arms without shaking. My heart is burning a hole in my chest. Heartbreak feels physically painful. Insults bite like bullets and hurt crawls along my skin in prickly goosebumps. I feel lightheaded and nauseous. I want to run but I can’t move, and I don’t have anywhere to go anyway. My back aches, but I haven’t left the house in three days. It feels like a desperate need to be safe but not knowing where to find that safety since an anxiety attack can come from anywhere; in the middle of my seminar in front of 10 complete strangers, alone in my room or out for drinks with my closest friends. It feels like not knowing if I want to be alone or surrounded by people I love the most, and suddenly doubting that those people love me back. It feels like everything in the world is wrong and alien, and I feel numb. It was at the climax of all of this that those childhood monsters came to visit me again. There were nights when I was so sleep deprived that they appeared as hundreds of spiders crawling across my walls, jolting me back awake just as I was about to drift off. If anyone ever tells you that anxiety is just a problem of the mind, it’s impossible to explain just how wrong they are. Anxiety isn’t just a mental illness. For some like me, it can become so out of control that it takes on its own physical form. After a year of crippling, wildly uncontrollable anxiety, it became clear that the best thing I could do was go home. Over the next few months, my anxiety simmered down to a manageable temperature. With each walk through my familiar hometown, another spider began to crawl away. My nails began to grow back. The dark bags under my eyes softened, and I ate real food. I wrote real essays and started numerous new projects. The tin-can robot retired back to his cupboard and the shadow man disappeared. There is no clown under my bed, just the resolute remains of an anxiety-monster that made my life unliveable for two long years. I don’t think it will ever go away, but neither will the lessons I learned about fighting, survival and resilience. Submissions are closed.",2017
Just Because I’m Here Doesn’t Mean I’m Okay,"I spent the night in the emergency room last night. I couldn’t breathe and I was experiencing chest pain. I couldn’t manage my thoughts. I felt out of control. I began thinking that there was nothing in my life worth living for. Nothing I tried would make these thoughts go away. I knew I needed help. So I went to the emergency room. I saw the doctor and an on-call counsellor. She listened to my story. The entire time I waited for her to say that I was overreacting or wasting her time. I waited for her to tell me what I hear too often — that I need to calm down. But she didn’t say that. She validated my feelings and empathized with me. We made a safety plan. A plan that at the very least, meant to help me through a tough moment, and at the most, provide me with a plan if I felt like I would hurt myself or others. We discussed my support system, reasons for living, and we made short and long term plans together. At the end of the ﬁve hours I spent at the hospital, I felt like I would be okay. But most importantly, I felt cared for. I was asked to call my boyfriend’s mom to come and get me and my anxiety crept back up. She’s going to think you’re ridiculous for calling. You shouldn’t bother her. She doesn’t really care what you’re going through. She would rather sleep than be here with you. She’s going to think you’re a mess. She won’t want you to date her son anymore. His family is better off without you. You’re so pathetic. I took a chance and called her. She was, of course, nothing but compassionate and helpful. She was very concerned and wanted to help me in any way she could. I got home at 5 AM, needing to leave for work in 2 hours. I couldn’t silence my thoughts about what my boss would think when I called and said that I couldn’t make it. He doesn’t understand your problems. You look ﬁne at work — he probably thinks you’re exaggerating your problems. You don’t appear depressed or anxious, so he doesn’t believe you. He thinks you’re overreacting. You can’t do anything right. You suck at your job. You’re going to get ﬁred. He doesn’t care that you’re struggling — you’re just an employee. Everyone at work is going to think you’re lazy. You don’t deserve this job. After 40 minutes of drafting, I sent a 3-line email to my boss explaining that I couldn’t make it in. It was 6AM before I fell asleep. “Everyone gets nervous sometimes.” “You don’t look depressed.” “Some people have it way worse.” Too often, I hear a combination of those words when I tell someone about my mental health struggles. The stereotypes and stigma surrounding mental health made it very hard for me to even accept that I had a problem. And I think that’s the case for a lot of people. This term has been a turning point in my mental health journey. While I had suffered from anxiety throughout my teenage years, the university environment ampliﬁed the struggle. I tried to chalk my anxiety up to nervousness or stress. I convinced myself that I was overreacting. I thought that because I was functioning and wasn’t hearing voices or hurting myself, that I was ﬁne. But mental illness looks and feels different to everyone. As an engineering student, I attempt to quantify everything. But mental illness occurs on a spectrum. Self-harm, suicidal thoughts, or drug abuse are all very real symptoms of mental illness — but so are symptoms such as excessive worrying, irrational fears, and persistent sleeping problems. Being a student at UW for engineering often goes hand-in-hand with being an overachiever. We battle long hours of class, difﬁcult exams, and co-op all at the same time — but somehow still make it through. But just because we’re here and making it through, doesn’t mean that we’re all okay. On the outside and to people that I don’t know well, I may appear to be perfectly healthy. I’m intelligent, I have a job, I take care of myself, and I’m often smiling or laughing. But on the inside, I’m in pain, my thoughts are racing, and I’m out of control. This is what is sometimes referred to as “high-functioning anxiety”. Through the university’s mental health services and counselling services, I accessed counselling during times of emergency. I then began seeing a doctor at health services for medication. I now take two types of medication, one daily and one as needed. Now, on co-op, I struggle with adjusting to my medication. I miss work frequently, due to increased anxiety and physical symptoms such as nausea, insomnia, and fatigue. Because of my high-functioning nature, each day I am hopeful that I can return back to work. But at night, the panic and anxiety sets back in again. When I do miss work or school, I spend the day in bed. In response, I often hear “I wish I could spend all day in bed, that would be so relaxing”. But it’s not. I don’t want to be in bed — I want to be at work. I spend my day drifting in and out of sleep, sleep being the only time I don’t feel paralyzed with anxiety. I often go days before even approaching the recommended caloric intake of one day. I can’t be bothered to feed myself, put on clothes, or tend to my appearance. It’s now been over a week since I’ve been at work — my longest absence. After a counselling session, I am going to attempt to go back tomorrow. But it’s going to be difﬁcult. Along with the normal stresses of a job, I face anxiety related to stigma. I wonder what people will think. I worry about looking too depressed or anxious, but at the same time, too happy. I am afraid that if I look too happy, people will believe that I’m exaggerating or overreacting. I believe that my colleagues will decide that I’m more trouble than I’m worth and that they won’t realize I have a diagnosed illness and I’m trying my best. And as a result, I struggle with validating my illness. This fuels my anxiety further. When I tell people that I suffer from anxiety, they equate anxiety with nervousness. Anxiety is more than that. It’s sensory overload; feeling afraid, physically sick, angry, and nervous all at the same time. It’s imagining the worst case scenario in your head, over and over again. It’s feeling the emotions associated with every worst-case scenario that you create in your head. It’s overwhelming, intrusive, and irrational thoughts that will not stop about both real and hypothetical situations. Mental illness is not all or nothing. You can be depressed and be happy. You can have anxiety, even if you have moments of calm. Experiencing happiness or serenity does not invalidate your depression or anxiety. People that are mentally ill experience a wide range of emotions. I, and many other people with high-functioning mental illnesses, struggle with validating my own feelings and behaviours. When I am reminded that other people have it worse or that everyone gets “nervous” or “sad”, I begin to doubt myself and my illness. But I have to remind myself that mental illness is more complicated than being “crazy” or “normal”. We all have to remind ourselves that mental illness is not black and white.",2017
Sarah-tonin,"I love puns. I was thoroughly amused to be prescribed an inhaler called Seretide for a persistent wheeze otherwise known as asthma at the age of fourteen. Sarah-tide…get it? Anyway. Recently I’ve had a bee in my bonnet about serotonin. Not the Mystery Jets album mind you, the hormone, although there may be a connection with Young Love. Disclaimer: I’m not a psychiatrist, I don’t have a psychology degree, neuroscience is a whole realm of knowledge i grasp little of. But I think there’s something to be unpacked about the idea that a chemical could help us understand relationships, both with our minds and those we love. A chemical neurotransmitter that helps pass signals along in the brain and nervous system. High levels of it are also found in other areas of your body like your digestive system. Serotonin is known to be associated with feelings of wellness and helping to regulate our moods. It’s also released when you fall in love. How cool that this little compound is whizzing around all of us, seeing us through ups and downs, just doing its thing, just being there. The interesting thing about serotonin and conditions like depression is that to this day it’s not conclusively known whether depression causes a reduction in levels of serotonin or whether low levels of serotonin cause depression. Quite the chicken and the egg (or Euthyphro dilemma for philosophy nerds like me) we’ve got there. Some medications to treat depression, anxiety and other mental health problems contain what are known as Selective Serotonin Re-uptake Inhibitors — chemicals which help to regulate your levels of serotonin by stopping it being lost from your system. I know a lot of people are a little dubious about the use of medication to treat mental health conditions, but for some people i love dearly, and many more besides, medication gives them the support they need to tackle unhelpful thought-patterns and move forward. For a long time I’ve been a worrier. I was brought up in a household where there was a lot of worrying going on, worrying about each other, worrying about decisions, worrying about worrying (about worrying). Soren Kierkegaard said that ‘anxiety is the dizziness of freedom’, and for me the most debilitating thing about anxiety is the paralysis that comes in the face of a decision which might seem trivial to most but fills you with a terror you can’t quite put your finger on. I also blame and shame myself a lot, bearing the weight of a plethora of things I haven’t done quite well enough — that I’m not good enough. There’s a certain pain in dwelling on the fact that it’s the way you’re thinking that’s making you feel miserable, and that percieved fault driving you even further into that same feeling. All the while your mind remains with you, the internal berating continues and you stay rooted to the spot. There are debates and discussions surrounding the causes of mental health problems like anxiety and depression, whether it’s genetic, or a chemical imbalance in your body, whether it’s the result of learned patterns of thinking, or a reaction to trauma experienced. In all of those possible explanations, at the root of it all, whether you feel that way because of the chemical, or there’s a lack of the chemical as a biproduct of the way you feel, there’s something beautifully arbitrary, or universal in fact about that very paradox. You’re not the only one with this hormone in your bloodstream, even if the levels may differ from time to time and person to person. For me, even considering the presence of a chemical compound having a role in the way I was feeling, stopped me blaming myself quite so hard. It felt liberating in a way I hadn’t felt for a long time. But what to do once you’ve acknowledged that you can be at the mercy of your emotions and the chemicals that might be unbalanced at times? It’s all well and good thinking about it in the abstract, but it doesn’t necessarily solve the problem of how we all muddle through. Like many twenty-somethings living in London, or anywhere for that matter, romance is not always easy. Dating is messy, or heartbreaking, or tbh we’re just too busy. In this Tinderverse nothing seems to work out quite like we’d hoped it would, and if you’re a blame-oholic like me, that can spell a recipe for thinking that there’s something I should or shouldn’t have said or done. The reality is there are a multitude of reasons why people fall in and out of love, and it’s heartening to know that some of those are a whole lotta chemicals. Can’t stop thinking about that special someone, can’t eat, can’t sleep? That my friends is serotonin at play. This connection fascinated me. How wonderful I thought, reflecting on this fact, so the low you feel when you’ve got all excited about someone and it doesn’t work out is cause you’re having serotonin withdrawal. They do say love is a drug after all. One of my best friends had an insight when I shared this epiphany with her the other day. Whilst she could see where I was coming from, she said that the thing that helps her feel better when love isn’t going her way is talking to a friend who more often than not will say ‘oh that sucks, I know how you feel, this happened to me when…[insert tale of romantic woe]…someone better will come along’. It dawns on you that you’re not alone in this, that you’re not the first and you certainly won’t be the last to feel this way. It might not be a cure for a broken heart but that empathy eases the pain. How nice would it be if everyone felt so at ease being open and honest about the state of their mental health? In our society whilst things are much better than they were, mental health is still a source of discrimination and alienation. We’re perfectly on board with the concept that romantic relationships can provide love and companionship that nobody would deny can be incredibly fulfilling. But we’re still sheepish and ashamed to admit that our relationship with our own mind isn’t going well. Hearing that you’re not alone when you’re feeling heartbroken, depressed or anxious can be the first step to seeing beyond what can seem like a bleak horizon. You can dust yourself off and start again, safe in the knowledge that when there are bumps in the road, you’ll have friends to be there and support you. Serotonin and sisterhood are sorta like two sides of the same coin, both elements of something that we share, a need for connection, however we grasp it. There’s a lot of unexplainables about love, and about mental health, even in the relationship between what we feel and what’s rushing through our bloodstream, and the thoughts that are racing or spiralling in our minds. Sharing how you feel with someone you can trust is an anchor in the midst of an uncertain world where we all feel pain and loss and alienation. Talking about the ups and downs of love, and the highs and lows of our moods, can help us realise our connectedness both in terms of our awareness but also through forging relationships with those whose love remains throughout. Now we’re sero-talking.",2017

WFRB: Rebuilding,"In the last few years, social media became a huge part of my life. It became the poster of my identity and the movie theater of other’s lives. It became the place where I get validation, and pump self-esteem doses inside of me like a junkie. In January 2016, I was carrying a Lumia 720, that device changed my life significantly for a month and a half. As we all know, Windows Phone is not the platform to use if you’re heavily dependent on, well, smartphones. It feels irrelevant. As much as this sounds like a con, it was a huge pro for me. Checking social media portals was a pain in the ass for me because of the outdated apps and sluggish performance. It was so annoying that I just give up and get bored before the app loads up. It was irritating at first, but then, something really amazing happened: I no longer had the urge to check the apps. I just, disconnected… and it was the best month and a half of my life. Period. I felt more present, in every single aspect in my life: prayers, study, home and even human interactions. And time, time was passing much slower, I was able to do so much and there would be plenty of time left! I had the best sleep in my life in that month, I even fell in love by the end of it, and even though it didn’t work out, that feeling, the feeling of completeness, so complete that you fall in love with someone just to pour love and expect nothing back is amazing! And I can’t wait to feel that impulse again. Today, I’m logging off from Twitter and Facebook, my most checked social media networks. I’ve been doing well with other habits so let’s see how this will work out. I encourage everyone to take the same step, you can google the benefits, but it would be great to find company through the distance. Love.",2017
3 Ways I Struggle With My BPD,"Although Borderline Personality Disorder is becoming one of the most commonly diagnosed mental illnesses; it continues to be one of the least understood. Perhaps its diagnostic frequency is due to the wide range of symptoms it presents. At some point in time in most people’s lives, I am sure they have exhibited a trait or two off the list of BPD criteria, however, I have all but one, and the symptoms and mannerisms are not once and a while, but every minute of my day that I am awake. So, in an effort to enlighten as many people as possible, I am going to share some of my personal experiences related to the recognized symptoms of BPD. 1. Impulsive and Risky Behavior Borderline Personality Disorder is a life of extremes where we bounce from happiness to sadness, each emotion felt at a level far more intense than the average person. Impulsivity is the tendency to act with little regard for restraint and without considering the consequences. For many people affected by BPD these bouts of impulsivity and risk taking behaviors go along with the periods where we are at the extreme top end of the scale. The BPD symptoms of impulsivity can present itself in many ways but some of the most common are:• Substance abuse• Overspending• Gambling• Self- Harm/Suicide• Promiscuity• Binge eating • Reckless driving I have an addictive personality by nature and genetics. I have been through a gamut of both recreational and prescription drugs becoming addicted to a few different things along the way. My drug addictions were all short term and I was able to “control” them by replacing the heavier substance with a lighter one, until I was weaned off one and addicted to a lighter drug, the supposed premise being that I replace the more damaging substance with something a little less harmful. In most cases however, until the source of the addictive behavior itself is identified and dealt with, the addiction will always linger. I also struggle with self-harm and suicidal thoughts and have done so for the majority of my life. Obviously my suicide attempts were unsuccessful but my body tells a story with its scars; each one tells a tale, and I wish I could tell you I remember what they all represent, and why they are there, but those memories are limited to only a few. The common denominator however is the instigation factor, rejection, whether it is evident or perceived it is completely real to me. The suicidal thoughts become so heavy I feel like I am anchored to the bottom of the ocean floor, dark and drowning. I have learned to allow myself to have those thoughts, and feel the corresponding emotions, as fighting them only seems to increase the urge. I will say that although I may not have control over these thoughts, I have learned to make sure they only stay thoughts and do not turn into actions. 2. Unstable and poorly regulated emotions BPD feels like having your emotions on constant sensory overload or like being in the eye of an emotional hurricane. Regardless of which emotion, the intensity presents at a level which is almost indescribable. The best comparison I can think of is…imagine your most devastating moment of grief, pain or anger, double it and live with it daily. My feelings can get so intense I feel like the only way to deal with them without physically hurting myself or verbally abusing others is to shut down emotionally, or dissociate from those feelings. It has been a safety method I have resorted to since before I can remember, and a skill I have yet to let go of. Adding to the intensity and unstableness of my emotions is the frequency they occur. On a good day I am lucky to have only 3 or 4 mood swings, ranging from anger to tears, lasting maybe 15 minutes to an hour each time. On a bad day, I can expect at least double that amount and the length of time varying so much it is too difficult to keep track of. It is like living in a state of hypo or hyper arousal every single day, which on paper would look like the ups and downs of a physically unstable person on a heart monitor. The lines go way up, then drop way down with no real predictable pattern.So now I am rampant with intense emotions bouncing from feeling ok to being severely depressed, emotions I can barely understand and yet I am expected to have complete control over them. I am working through therapy to try and get a grasp on them and will admit that my defeats far outnumber my victories in this category. 3. A pattern of unstable relationships Given what has already been mentioned above, there is no surprise that Borderlines have a greater difficulty establishing and maintaining relationships of any kind. My relationships may be very intense, unstable, and alternate between the extremes of over idealizing and undervaluing people who are important to me. It stems from fear of rejection and abandonment and encompasses a whole lot of push and pull and testing, almost like a child would test a parent, to see if you are just another person who will leave. I lost a lot of friends due to this aspect of my illness, as the average person cannot understand why one day I am their best friend and next I’m pushing them away, simply to see if they will come back. If you do this enough times, most people don’t come back, as they simply can’t handle the emotional whirlwind. For me, it makes perfect sense. I have to test over and over and if you come back, I am able to build trust. I guess this is why I have very few friends and trust very few people. This pattern of unstable relationships is not only confined to friends, but affects family, co-workers and just about anyone I come into contact with for any extended period of time. I am always so afraid that people will leave that in order to maintain some control; it is easier if I make them leave and they don’t do it on their own accord. It makes socializing with friends and family terribly difficult and establishing relations with co-workers just as hard. As my resume would indicate, I have a hard time holding a job for more than a few years as the random emotional outbursts are generally not welcomed in a workplace. Being social and wanting to have people to love and who love you is a part of human nature. It is something I desperately crave, yet at the same time, doing so leaves me vulnerable which usually ends in me getting hurt. It feels like the proverbial being stuck “between a rock and a hard place” and simply not yet having the skills or tools to dig myself out. So, I continue to try a bit more each day. I try to be conscious of my push and pull and attempt to lessen the number of times it occurs. I try different techniques so that my anger does not unleash its fury instantly. I try to limit the amount of time I allow myself to feel suicidal, not that it always works, but the effort is there. BPD is a constant learning experience, and it’s a good thing I am up to the challenge.",2017
Enduring the Emotional Drain of the Holidays,"I, for one, am glad it is all over. The hustle and bustle, the rushing, the stress, the pressure, the preparations and the nonsensical expectations placed on a single day. It’s not like it’s a once in a lifetime kind of day but rather the type that reoccurs as yearly as the seasons. It’s not just the recently passed Christmas and New Year’s but any other day of the year that qualifies as a holiday that often triggers survivors, and people struggling with a mental illness. Societal pressure to find the right gift, to spend the right amount of money, to visit the right people and act in the appropriate manner and to make the occasion perfect all add to the already heavy load we carry daily.Society’s representation of the perfect family gathering for the perfect holiday occasion is shoved down our throats in T.V shows, movies and advertising. Take Christmas for example, the generations gathered happily around the extended dining room table, passing the stuffing and mashed potatoes with a smile, to be followed by an evening of family stories around the piano, filled with song, laughter and good times; the stereotypical storybook family. For survivors of trauma, just the very thought of the above scenario can send us into a downward spiral, as it is likely that for us, it is no more than a fantasy, since more than likely our fairytales were turned into nightmares long, long ago. It is more apt that our guards will be up and we will be walking on eggshells and protecting boundaries while the argument about the stuffing rages and Uncle Bob has already passed out on the couch. It is likely that the dysfunction will trigger our past traumas leaving us to revert to whatever coping mechanism we can grasp. We hardly have time to open our gifts when the Christmas items are ripped down off the shelf and replaced with Valentines, then by the time we open our heart shaped box, the Easter Bunny has taken over, and this societal norm continues for every holiday, year after year. Marketing lures us into all the holiday hype when in fact, most of us have forgotten the actual meaning of the day. Does no one else wonder how a religious rebirth turned into chocolate bunnies? The entire premise of Valentine’s Day is to show your loved one how much you care on Feb 14th with flowers and chocolates, but what about the rest of the days? Why can’t love be shown in random ways on days we don’t have Hallmark cards for? Many survivors feel as lonely as I do on holidays. It doesn’t seem to matter who we surround ourselves with, what festivities we attend or how distracted we try to keep ourselves. There is a perpetual, nagging sense of emptiness and loss that is carried daily and entirely enhanced on holidays. Perhaps we wish for just one page from that book of fairytales. Perhaps we still wish for all the things we lost and cannot reclaim. Maybe we want just one family gathering where we feel loved and can be true to ourselves, free of judgment and shame. Maybe we wish for one Valentine’s Day where we are the recipients of the tokens and acts of love that we have never received, or did so with strings and repercussions. So surviving the actual day is one thing, but the emotional crash that often occurs after the holidays can be just as intense for a survivor as the actual holiday itself. I know for me, it takes an immense amount of emotional energy to deal with the both the holiday build up, and the end of buildup. The depression tends to set in quickly and heavily afterward and regardless of my attempts to keep my hopes and expectations lowered out of instinctual self-protection, there is always a sense of disappointment; a reminder of my loneliness on days when there is societal pressure for family, or outwardly expressed love. So be good to yourself around any holiday. Surround yourself with the things or people that make you happy and bring you peace in the present moment, because no amount of hope will change the past. Remind yourself that despite the label, a holiday is just another day, another 24 hours, and that you have managed to get through all of them so far with strength and resilience, and the next one will be no different.",2017
How can our personal fears and anxieties render us weak?,"For the past 20 years, I had the ultimate mentor, he used to teach me how to take any step towards anything that lives throw at me. Basically during all my down depression hard time, I always feel that my anxiety of what could happen, which sometimes be called nervousness, and I always feel it in my belly. This caused me a lot of discomfort and the fear of this anxiety always hindered me diminished my capabilities and increased my negativity and never helped me try to become a stronger version of myself. To overcome that, he taught me to sense and feel my belly as an indicator. It is related to something way more than what my head can relate to, so he taught me to feel my belly as a guidance for such feeling if it is present. it is more like a six sense that we all need to master; it is different than saying that my head is making my body feel sick but rather it is a way that the body is communicating to itself to show how it reacts as much as the brain. It is really all one thing, it is the perception of how it deals with fears and anxieties, the body is your mind, it is like the neurological signals through the spinal cord wrapped around the body; it is the brain in the belly that is communicating. For me, it didn’t make any sense at such young age, but then I read about neuro muscle connection, deep breathing benefits, and it showed that the mind and the body works together to achieve what they are trained to do or feel. The body has way more neuro transmitters than the brain connected together for a closed system, this system can make us feel weak if we are fearing something because the body is reacting in a self-reservation mode; that can reflect in a bad posture, a sensitive belly or overall discomfort. The brain through the spinal cord down to the neuron vortex wrapping the overall body, it is how the nervous system works, and the idea is that the mind is one thing and the nervous system is a different thing. The nervous system is always affected by any outside stimulus which surrounds the body and expresses itself in neuro muscular dysfunction, that’s why the belly feels tight because you are doing it with your muscles. The thing is, if you are physically damaged, you are going to be mentally damaged. It is the psycho-emotional damaged theory, and it is much like the dilemma of “which comes first: the chicken or the egg?” When you aren’t in a top of your physical shape and you feel like depressed or you are mentally down that makes you look out of shape, but it doesn’t matter anymore, as I learnt how to master the body mind connection through the years. We have all the tools that we need to harness and manipulate our body to shape it into what works for each of us; which also enhances the way that our brain works. So the first step is to relax the muscular tension which is built in your belly; it is like you are physically taking the shape of a particular motion that the body mimics like fear or anger. The first muscles that are contracted are the belly and then the neck; and you can reduce them at any given point by walking tall and lifting your head up. You can be depressed or anxious but walking with chest and head up; we don’t normally do that when we are depressed and that’s why the body reacts to such way and makes us feel uncomfortable. It is the same just like you can’t feel good about yourself if you walked around with sloppy shoulders; you should be strong and healthy to experience what life throws at you and if at your core, you aren’t relaxed to feel and acknowledge every small detail with just the body over the brain, with deep breathing that circulates within your overall body, only then you can set the strain that the body is feeling to overcome the current situation and allow it to get back in control. I will make another article related further to deep breathing and how it affectes our mind body connection, till then, release the tension in your belly, walk tall and get stronger and feel physically stronger.",2017
Overcoming Paralyzing Fear,"Every generation of mankind has faced situations that seemed world-threatening. Every generation has had moments when it seemed like all that they knew and loved was being destroyed, and they were paralyzed in fear. To them and to us this psalm speaks and proclaims the authority and hope of God. No matter how desperate things seem, God is still active. God is still on His throne. This world will not cease to exist until He says it is time. Make no mistake about this truth, that the world is temporary. Peter wrote: But the day of the Lord will come like a thief, and then the heavens will pass away with a roar, and the heavenly bodies will be burned up and dissolved, and the earth and the works that are done on it will be exposed. (2 Peter 3:10) One day Christ will return and the world will be judged and ruled by Him. He and He alone is worthy and able to rule over this world, and He will do so with justice and righteousness. But until that time comes, we are to trust in God and to be responsible in caring for the world — to proclaim God’s truth to its people and to protect nature, as this is our original responsibility given us by God. But our obligation is not to worry also. We are to trust God in all things, and to carry on our work that He has given us to do until He returns. One of the new realities of today’s world that increases our stress is its hyper-connectedness, through social media and technology. Now wherever we go we can be found, emailed, texted, and telephoned. Just look at the way people walk down the street and it seems that 50% have their eyes focused on their I-phones. This has upset the way we live and competes with times of peace and relaxation. Anxiety and depression are both on the increase in today’s world. We need to obey the words of this psalm: Be still, and know that I am God.I will be exalted among the nations,I will be exalted in the earth!” (Psalm 46:10) How we need times of peaceful reflection, times to stop and think about God, to absorb His truth into our hearts, to pray and converse with Him. Truth must not only be proclaimed, it must also be understood and claimed. Take time today to meditate on this text, God is our refuge and our strength, and a very present help in trouble — the King James says “an ever-present help.” He is always here and near. Dwell through meditation and faith in that reality!",2017

Young Adults Are More Likely to Develop Seasonal Affective Disorder,"January. The excitement of the holidays is over. It’s time to return to your college classes after a nice, long break. For those in northern climates, there’s also less sunlight and painfully cold temperatures to contend with. It’s completely normal to feel a little bummed out about it all, right? In most cases, yes, it is normal to feel a little “blah” during the winter months. But, if those feelings seem to be having a negative impact on your ability to complete your day-to-day responsibilities and your desire to get out of your house or dorm room and hang out with others, you may be experiencing Seasonal Affective Disorder. Seasonal Affective Disorder, or SAD, is a type of clinical depression that strikes people in the fall and winter months. Like other types of depression, SAD often results in fatigue, loss of interest in daily activities, anxiety, overeating, alcohol and/or substance misuse, sleep disruptions, and difficulty concentrating. Who Is Most Likely to Develop SAD? Some evidence indicates that SAD is most likely to occur in young adults in their late teens and early twenties. Though no one is exactly sure why it may be due in part to the fact that many young adults have a lifestyle that is not conducive to a regular sleep schedule. They often have college class schedules and jobs that require them to study or work outside of the typical 9 to 5 schedule of older adults.Young adults also sometimes struggle with the additional stress that comes with uncertainty and instability. They are typically in a stage where they are sorting out what they want to do with their lives, striving to become financially stable, and trying to determine what they want and need from romantic relationships. SAD is most prevalent among women, and among those who have a predisposition for depression. This would include those who have a family history of depression, or who have experienced other types of depression — like major, chronic, or manic depression.

Why You Need to Have People in Your Life That Will Help Carry Your Burdens,"I slowly pull my shirt over my head and begin getting dressed. The doctor heads to the sink to wash his hands while I frown. He didn’t even touch me. Just used the end of a stethoscope. Doctors are weird. “Tests came back clean, too,” he says, raising his voice above the noise from the faucet. I wait while he finishes scrubbing and then takes a seat across from me. The chart flips open, and he quickly scans my paperwork. “Says here you came in about a week ago. Pain medication. Because you…” he pauses and looks up from behind the chart, then back down. “Jeezus, kid. Wounded in Afghanistan?” I nod. The doctor adjusts his chair then sets the chart on the counter. “When did you get back?” “About a month ago,” I state, rubbing the area where my wrist shattered, “The school gave me an exemption to miss the first three weeks because of my… circumstance.” He nods in return, then sits up straight, like he’s suddenly been struck by inspiration. “Tell me, does your heart ‘hurt’ while you’re in class or large groups?” I give a simple nod. “What about when walking around on campus? Do you feel fear? Like maybe…” he trails off, trying to put it sensitively, “…like maybe you’re back there?” “I guess.” There’s a long pause while he waits me out. “I can’t walk on the grass. If I try, I get weirded out. My heart feels like it’ll explode.” “Why not,” the doctor asks, intrigued. “I just can’t, okay? You’re the doctor. You tell me!” I raise my voice, indignant. The doctor rolls forward in his chair, looks me in the eyes, and then sympathetically says, “You’re having anxiety or panic attacks. Maybe both. It’s why you feel the way you do.” I leave the doctor’s office that day, turning down medication and storming off, disappearing into the flood of students headed to class at the university I attend. I was going to prove him wrong. I can walk on grass. I can beat these emotions. But it will be almost a full year before I can step off the sidewalk or any path for that matter. Afghanistan happened to be the most heavily mined country on earth while I was there. On more than one occasion we had to find our way out of mined areas, and a few friends lost limbs. 60-Minutes reporter, Lara Logan, will even visit the base to cover Afghanistan’s “forgotten war,” only to ride in a vehicle that’s blown up and then attacked two days after her arrival. You just don’t go off paths without it spelling death. And while I may have been safe and sound on campus, the wound continued to hound me. “‘Are you in pain, Frodo?’ said Gandalf quietly as he rode by Frodo’s side. ‘Well, yes I am,’ said Frodo. ‘It is my shoulder. The wound aches, and the memory of darkness is heavy on me. It was a year ago today.’‘Alas! there are some wounds that cannot be wholly cured,’ said Gandalf.‘I fear it may be so with mine,’ said Frodo. ‘There is no real going back. Though I may come to the Shire, it will not seem the same; for I shall not be the same. I am wounded with knife, sting, and tooth, and a long burden. Where shall I find rest?’” In one of the famous scenes from Lord of the Rings, Frodo is stabbed by an undead Morgul-blade during a battle with Ringwraiths at Weathertop and almost dies. Upon defeating Sauron, and making his way back to the Shire, he has that conversation with the wizard, Gandalf. Just like Frodo, each of us carry wounds that have refined or defined us. Certain moments have caused deep wounds that we still feel to this very day. Some of us have let it refine us and we have come out stronger; other wounds, just like Frodo’s, have changed us to the core. It doesn’t have to be a panic or anxiety attack that happens when we reflect on what’s happened; some of us spiral into depression or self-destructive tendencies. It could be a sound.Perhaps a smell.Maybe a memory. And we’re right back feeling that old wound even though it appears as nothing more than a scar these days. When asked what’s wrong we can even shrug it off. After all, we were the one wounded and have carried it all these years on our own, thankyouverymuch. The relationship between Sam and Frodo in the Lord of the Rings has always fascinated me. Not the nature of their friendship, but the realization that Frodo wasn’t the strong on, Sam was. Both endured the same horrors and tragedy throughout the story, but Sam was the resilient one. Frodo may have carried the ring longer, but even Sam carried it for a season and defeated a giant spider in the process of rescuing Frodo. Had Sam not been there to spur Frodo on, Frodo would have given up eventually, and succumbed to the ring’s power. Just like the story, we need other people to carry us when we’re about to give up. Sometimes we are Frodo. Other times we are Sam. Sometimes we carry the wound. Sometimes we carry others. But the journey towards wholeness is not one we can take alone. It just doesn’t work that way. For a long time, I was Frodo carrying my wounds and feeling them long after they’d become a distant memory. For most of my adult life, I felt torn in two. I would shrug off others’ concern and continue to hold the weight of my “ring” single-handedly. What it took to change, however, was a “Sam” to begin the healing process and shoulder the burden. The “Sams” in my life weren’t perfect or whole either, just as Sam wasn’t. And out of that experience, I learned a valuable lesson: Healing people heal people. At the end of the Lord of the Rings, Frodo is permitted to leave Middle Earth and sail to the Undying Lands to finally find his peace and healing. He is on his way towards that process, but it leaves Sam as the one torn in two. Frodo responds to him with this: “My dear Sam. You cannot always be torn in two. You will have to be one and whole for many years. You have so much to enjoy and to be and to do. Your part in the story will go on.” My dear reader: You, likewise, cannot always be torn in half. Though your wounds are great, surround yourself with people who will carry you when the weight of your “ring” becomes too much. There is much to enjoy in this life despite the darkness that may surround it. Your story is still unfolding… …and what a story it will be.

Today I totaled my car and learned a lot of life lessons,"By Lena Potts This morning I drove directly into the back of another car at 30–40mph on the freeway. Not on purpose (trust me, this is hugely inconvenient for me), but also it’s 100% my fault. No mitigation here. I got into a car accident because I was distracted. I was distracted because I don’t take care of myself well enough. Last night I was texting a friend about how my anxiety, and the whole mess of symptoms that come with it, had been pretty bad lately. I’m a workaholic, and gladly take on a lot of projects and challenges, partially to keep myself busy (I’m useless if I’m bored), and partially because I like to have been able to do the impossible. I’m crazy that way. These are actual (redacted, to avoid embarrassment beyond me telling the story of how I completely fucked up my car, could have hurt another person and myself) texts about my mental health I sent last night. Even in the texts I sound scattered, unfocused, and off-kilter. There’s a random text in the middle about Ed Sheeran, which my phone corrected to Ed Sheehan, because that’s how my head was working. That’s how it’s been working. I’ve had an anxiety disorder and depression for 10 years. Mostly I manage alright, and I am generally a very high-functioning person. Lately, though, I’ve been like a montage in a teen movie where the protagonist gets all out of character and starts doing ~crazy things~ they never do, and moves a mile a minute and smiles a lot, and it all ends in an overdose or car accident where they learn to be true to themselves and do better and bond with an older family member. This morning on my commute I tried to plan out my day very precisely. There are a few projects I’ve gotten behind on, partially because I could have managed them better, and partially because they’re extremely difficult to manage. I left work last night incredibly stressed, feeling like I was very sincerely failing, and sent my friend those texts as I considered some self-care. But then, despite agreeing that I’d go home and stretch and sleep, I didn’t. I posted some pretty good tweets and read some news instead, basically distracting myself rather than really calming myself. I got up, got ready for work, and didn’t do the first thing on my to-do list- so I basically woke up already messing up, and really deeply feeling that I was stuck in this failure mode. And I started my 25 mile commute. While driving, I started planning out how I’d get everything done, how’d I’d make this all work and get myself out of my little hole, and then it’d all be better once I caught up. I ignored that my problematic, anxious responses are less about the stimulus, i.e. really normal work stress, and more about the fact that my own mental illness has never really allowed me to deal with those stimuli in a healthy way. Somewhere on this bullshit fix it train I snapped back into reality, right behind traffic that was way wayyyyyy slowed down, and I sure as shit wasn’t. I wasn’t even scared while I was braking, so much as I angrily thought to myself, “are you serious Lena, you got us into this accident.” And then wham. Luckily, everyone is physically okay. But I can’t move past this trying to pretend that I’m really okay. I’ve always acted like just because I can make it through the day and get everything done well, that I’m doing well. But today my mental health and the ways I deal with it, or really don’t deal with it, had very real consequences, consequences that could have been much worse. Messing up as seriously as I did today does really teach you things, even if I’m not crying on a front porch with my grandfather (so that the next episode I can be totally fine and we’ll never talk about it again like there are no long-term, red-tapey reprecussions to a car accident, like, ya know, the insurance claims process and getting another car so that you can go to work. Like really though WTF TV you didn’t prepare me for being a person). So even though its obnoxious, here are the actual things I’ve walked away with from completely fucking up 9 hours ago.",2017
The Anxiety-Depression Boat,"I’m a fully functioning, fairly average girl in my mid twenties. I have a decent job, nice flat, great boyfriend, supportive family and amazing friends. I have hobbies and I enjoy having fun with my nearest and dearest. I take pleasure in the small victories of life, in new nail varnish colours or an unfamiliar recipe I’ve managed to cook. Oh yeah, and I suffer from anxiety and depression. Mental health is discussed at a much wider level than when I first suffered from anxiety as a scared 10 year old. Celebrities are speaking out about their mental health battles. Companies are encouraged to treat psychological problems as they would physical ones. Doctors (in my experience at least) are taking more care over and interest in diagnoses. I don’t feel like the stigma surrounding mental health is 100% gone though. I used to be told ‘get over it’, ‘just go outside and get some fresh air and you’ll be fine’ or ‘face your fear’ in response to my anxiety. People thought I was just being daft, overly dramatic, even attention seeking. The worst part is that part of me agreed, and the weakness I felt for ‘allowing’ myself to be anxious and depressed exacerbated my symptoms. I still can’t shake the idea that I’ve somehow failed by giving into my worries all these years later. Whether I’m putting this on myself internally or whether it’s a message I’ve felt from the outside, I don’t know. But I do know that I need to give myself a break about my anxiety. Sure, I am much more comfortable with my mental health than I used to be. I can recognise triggers (mostly) and take steps to overcome it (again, mostly). I beat myself up less about feeling anxiety on a day to day basis, and am on the way to accepting that it is a part of who I am. Most of my close friends know about my anxiety, where once upon a time I was so embarrassed I kept it a secret (to what extent this worked I don’t know. I remember coming up with a lot of very flimsy excuses when my anxiety got in the way of plans). I have more confidence now, and I feel happy knowing my limits, what I do and don’t like to do, without feeling I need to change myself. As with everything, I have my good days and bad days. Currently I’m in the middle of a bad month. Anxiety has been my constant companion for more than 10 years, with depression occasionally joining the party. Anxiety I’m used to. Full scale depression I am not. The combo of the make for an interesting dynamic, neatly described by the picture below. That’s what I was faced with recently. For reasons I’m still not sure of, I — not to sound over dramatic — bombed out of my daily routine a little while ago, brought down by extreme exhaustion, palpations, despondency, insomnia; the works. I thought I was managing my familiarly over active mind, so it all came as a bit of a shock. And I was right back to square one when it came to accepting my issues. I dealt with it though. I’m on the road back to my own special semblance of normality once more. Talking helps. Admitting how I feel to others helps. Finding random articles online that nail exactly how I’m feeling, sometimes in an amusing way, helps (my addiction to scrolling aimless through news sites is potentially unhealthy, but occasionally I find gems like this, this and this which I really relate to). Anxiety and depression is more common than I realised as a kid, and that’s a good thing. Sharing and finding common ground is great as it makes you feel accepted as you are. That’s why I’m writing this. I want to celebrate my small victories and talk about my health in a way I haven’t before, not shying away from it or feeling sorry for myself but owning it. And maybe it’ll help someone else realise they aren’t alone in how they’re feeling. There are other people in the anxiety-depression boat.",2017
The Paradox of Perfectionism,"Perfection is the imaginary pot of gold at the end of the never-ending rainbow. After all, what is considered “perfect” is subjective, therefore it’s impossible to be perfect to everyone. Take Spirited Away, for example. The first time I saw that movie, I watched it seven times in a row. To me, everything from the animation to the film’s vibes to the mystical story, is perfection. But there’s one person in particular who would strongly disagree with me. Forget the five reviewers who boo’d the movie on RottenTomatoes (who I also assume have egg icons as their twitter bio pics), I’m talking about the creator of Spirited Away himself: Hayao Miyazaki. Miyazaki is a perfectionist, and when talking about creating his (stunningly beautiful…I’m not biased) films, he says: “Making films is all about, as soon as you’re finished, continually regretting what you’ve done. We look at films we’ve made, all we can see are the flaws…unless I start working on a new one, I’ll never be free from the curse of the last one.” This isn’t super surprising. After all, many creatives are staunch perfectionists, their own harshest critic. But it’s sad that someone who creates such beautiful work is haunted by it in a wholly different way than his audiences. And it’s sad to think that, had he let his perfectionism get the best of him? Spirited Away, my perfect idea of a film, might not exist. That’s the plague of many creatives: getting so caught up in imperfect details up close that we don’t let the strings of the process weave something whole. What starts as trying to improve can spiral into creative paralysis, or “The Perfectionist’s Paradox”: when striving to make your work perfect gets you so constricted with anxiety that it becomes all-or-nothing procrastination and you end up not making anything. Because perfectionism isn’t about our work at all. It’s out of anxiety we have towards ourselves and our own abilities. The perfectionist’s paradox struggle is real…like scientifically real. NyMag cited a study on perfectionism and procrastination in college students and reported, “Research has suggested that anxiety over making mistakes may ultimately be holding some perfectionists back from ever achieving success in the first place.” Making mistakes is seen as unacceptable because we internalize them as negative reflections of ourselves rather than what they are — part of the process. Mistakes exist so we can learn from them and be better. If the piece you’re trying to finish just isn’t turning out as you’d hoped, if you ran an ad campaign on social media that gets you zero new customers to your site, if nobody buys the one design in your Shop you thought was going to be a bestseller — these are all potholes that help us figure out where the pavement needs to be smoothed, the tears in the muscles that build our strength. Without mistakes and shortcomings, we wouldn’t know where to improve. I am a perfectionist. If I don’t wear the right coat on a cold day, my day is ruined because it didn’t go perfectly. For a long time, I let perfectionism get the best of me, letting myself get so caught up in the web of details while I wrote or drew that I could no longer see the big picture. “Writing” became “going on Twitter for an hour. “Drawing” became “staring at a blank sheet of paper, then getting cookies.” I forgot that in order to make something great, you have to be willing to let go of the anxiety and let yourself make something crappy to mold into something amazing. Don’t let the fear of being perfect keep you from creating or promoting your product or just trying. Without imperfection, we cannot improve or learn. And without imperfection, there is no art. Creativity is fueled by the imperfection we see in the world, an antidote to the imperfection we see in ourselves. If everything around us and within us was perfect, there would be no reason to reimagine our lives, world, and selves. So go. Make something. Tell your perfectionist self that nobody’s perfect, so you can be the most perfect imperfect being you can possibly be. If you want to sell your designs in an online shop but have been too nervous about the cost of products — especially when they go unsold — then Artist Shops are perfect for you.

Sobre romantizarem transtornos mentais,"Minha cara e meu jeito de menininha divertida não deixam transparecer o inferno que é sair na rua em alguns dias. Lidar com essa merda de síndrome do pânico e ansiedade é quase que insuportável e não tem nada de bonito e poético em passar mal na rua ou em casa sem motivo, tem se tornado cada vez mais difícil me controlar quando alguma coisa mexe com os meus gatilhos. Gatilhos, sabe? Uma palavrinha que define muito bem onde fica o limite de alguém. Depois de ter uma tarde onde eu precisei me trancar no banheiro da estação de metrô porque tudo começou a ficar confuso demais, meu coração disparou sem razão, minha cabeça começou a processar as coisas rápido demais, dando a impressão de que tinha algo extremamente ruim pronto pra acontecer, a última coisa que eu é chegar em casa, entrar no Facebook e ver pessoas achando bonito e aplaudindo um transtorno mental, romantizando e fazendo desse inferno todo algo bonito, algo que só pessoas especiais tem. Diz pra mim, em qual mundo vocês vivem? Ninguém quer depressão ou ansiedade, ninguém! De onde tiraram que essas coisas tornam alguém mais legal? Mais sensível? Mais bonitinho? Você não quer ter nenhuma dessas doenças, você não quer. Você é só um adolescente ou um adultinho de bosta que acha que depressão e ansiedade são lindos porque geram músicas e textos bonitos, porque pessoas doentes são tão adoráveis, vulneráveis, meu Deus, como é poético ter a cabeça fodida e mal conseguir comer ou sair na rua! Ficar sem sair do quarto? Travar durante o trabalho ou a aula? Ser invadido por uma sensação de medo extremo a qualquer momento? Perder completamente a fome? Sentir o corpo pesando e doendo tanto, mas tanto, que a impressão é de que você vai desmaiar? Ver todo o seu esforço perdendo o sentido de um minuto pro outro, sem mais nem menos? Questionar sua existência e se sentir um pedaço de lixo fazendo hora extra por aqui? Querer ficar em casa porque os sons e as luzes do lado de fora irritam e bagunçam todos os seus sentidos? Ah, essas pessoas…Essas pessoas devem ser tão amáveis, olha como elas são tristes, bonitas e sensíveis. É bonito ser triste! Vamos fazer desenhos fofos inspirando mais pessoas a serem assim: tristes. E o suicídio? Que tal tornar o suicídio um ato heroico, coisa de filme gringo? Aquela jovem transtornada, porém linda, que se mata se jogando da janela. Você por acaso já viu a foto de uma pessoa que se suicidou depois de se jogar do vigésimo andar de um prédio? Garanto que de poético e bonito não tem nada, é só um amontoado de carne, sangue e cérebro no chão. E se lotar de remédios, então? Nada mais fofo do que precisar frequentar um psiquiatra e sair de lá com uma receitinha pra um tarja preta que vai estragar o seu sono, seu humor e mudar sua personalidade por dias até começar a fazer algum efeito, se fizer! Pelo amor de Deus, parem de romantizar essas coisas. Não falem de doenças mentais como se elas fossem uma bênção na vida de alguém, enfrentar tudo isso é difícil e todo mundo que se encontra nessa situação luta pra sair vivo todos os dias, não é fácil lidar com algo que vem e vai a hora que quer. Ajudem quem precisa, não incentivem a tristeza, por favor.",2017
Fear of Failure (Or a Series of Half-Baked Metaphors),"Fear of failure is that nagging sensation in the back of your brain. It sneaks into your throat like bile during a particularly gross bout of heart burn. You fend it off with momentary successes and accomplishments, but it always comes back, hungrier and stronger. As a 28 (going on 29) year old creative type, my career path for much of my twenties was disjointed. Instead of building a skyscraper of experience, I built a strip mall. The ever present desire to further myself as an actor and writer caused my professional regular people resume to leave much to be desired. After working every survival job available to a struggling actor in their twenties (except bartending. Why never bartending? I’d be so good!), I stumbled into a career in women’s fashion. My last two jobs — minus a brief west coast stint in between — were a natural progression. I went from packing boxes in a fashion warehouse to working in customer experience for another fashion startup. I started to finally feel compelled to move forward in my professional career, to take on more responsibility in the same place rather than flounder until I found something new that stuck. When you begin wanting something so bad — a part in a film or a promotion — the pangs of rejection hurt that much more. In some ways it’s much easier just to lazily glide through life, wanting smaller goals, achieving them more quickly. That fear has caused me to refrain from trying too hard in the past. Recently, however, I put my all into a promotion and didn’t get it. Cue the nagging sensation and bile in throat. I have started to believe — almost sincerely — that sometimes it’s just the way the cookie crumbles. Maybe these crumbs are smaller and less delicious, but maybe not getting the whole cookie now means I’ll get a ginormous cookie cake later. It’s hard to feel that way all the time, but it’s the only way not to succumb to the quicksand of perceived failure. I don’t have the slightest idea what my life will look like in a year. Will I be promoted within my department (!), transitioned into a more creative role (!!), or will my web series finally get distributed and allow me to be an actual, honest to god actor (!!!)? I’m open to all three outcomes, and each present their own unique upsides and downsides. I used to be obsessed with this notebook I bought that had this cheesy quote on the cover: “Life isn’t about finding yourself. It’s about creating yourself.” Every milestone I achieve feels like a tiny puzzle piece in the 1000 piece puzzle that is the creation of my life. Maybe it’s difficult to get the full picture day to day, but I hope against hope that one day it’ll become clear. I oftentimes feel way too old to be in such a nascent stage in my professional (and acting, for that matter) career, but more optimistic people than myself like to say no one’s journey is the same. Sometimes it’s imperative to mind control murder the devil on your shoulder and trust things are as they should be. And when that doesn’t work, at least there’s wine.",2017
Long Term Plans.,"I found myself (at age 41) bantering with younger women on a Facebook group for women in tech about long term plans. Many of them believed plans were crucial for guiding transitions and decision-making. Work at a startup or push for the bigger corporate gig? Stay at home with a newborn for the first couple years? According to them, depends on your long term plans. I don’t buy it. I think life is much more capricious than our careful plan-making would have us believe. Too often, focusing on illusory long-term plans leads to a bigger fall down the line. Or, in the words of a wise friend of mine, “Why would my 40-year-old self want to listen to my 28-year-old self? He was an idiot.” Instead, what if we hone in on the feeling of the life we want to grow into? This feeling, when we hold it within ourselves, can be the guiding star to help us through unclear transitions. “Would the start-up move me closer to my guiding feeling? Could I still fulfill my responsibilities while growing closer to the person I want to be from the inside out?” It’s similar to how this writer approaches New Year’s resolutions: as overarching themes rather than a list of tasks. One more thing. The 2017 letter from Institute of Paramahansa Yogananda (who wrote Autobiography of a Yogi, bringing yoga to the West) says, The valiant soul (aka you, voyager) knows no defeat, only different stages of victory. Even if there are times when outwardly you do not see results, never be discouraged. If you have done everything you can, that infused mental power will remain with your soul. When I experience total failure in my writing — no clicks! no likes! no reads! — the valiant soul is who I channel. She’s doesn’t care about the clicks at all. p.s. 7 days left.

Write That Shit Down…,"I say this a lot to others ─ we are ALL a little bit mental. Forget the 1 in 4 statistic, (according to Mind, 1 in 4 people in the UK will experience a mental health problem each year), we are all affected. Even the most ‘horizontal’ of people, I believe. And it’s no surprise. It’s always been normal for us humans to get stressed, worried or anxious about things, whether it be relationships, life crises and such. And the state of the world as we know it, is rife with companies going into administration (parting was such sweet sorrow BHS…sob…), people losing their jobs, terrorist activity, Brexit, and that bloody Trump, (although this fun ‘Trump Donald’ page might put a smile on your face!). Whether you are struggling with anxiety, depression some other form of mental illness or have something playing on your mind, it helps to ‘write that shit down’. I’m not talking an essay or a poem ─ you don’t have to have a way with words. Some people don’t like to talk about their worries out of fear of being judged, being a burden or not being taken seriously. But let me tell you ─ keeping it in can be a first class ticket to panic attack on anxiety airways. When I went through my bout of anxiety, I found three methods really useful. I even use them now because I know how effective they can be in taking the edge off a worry I might have. Three Good Things This one is dead simple. Every night before you go to bed, or at any moment towards the end of the day, or not even every night. Do it when you can. Write down three good things that happened during your day. It helps if you have a little notebook especially for this so, before you know it , you can have a book full of good things that have happened to you over a period of time ─ great if you are having a down day and need to ‘re-set’. I get some people say to me ‘well nothing good has happened’, to which I joke, well you are speaking to me, and that is a great thing to happen(!). Joking aside, good things don’t necessarily have to be grand things, it can be something as simple as, you got up, you saw an amazing sunset, you ate your favourite chocolate cake, you achieved your weight loss target, whatever. It just has to be a good thing. Set A Worry Period Setting a worry period each day means that for that time, and that time only, you can try to address your worry, leaving the rest of your day to focus on other things and stay productive. When you come to your worry period ask yourself; a) is the worry still a worry? b) is there anything I can do about it? c) what’s the worst thing that can happen? Chances could be that your worry will no longer be a worry, and if it is, you have the opportunity to see whether you can do anything to make things better. If you can’t, you can either choose to accept ‘defeat’ and make the best of your situation, or continue to worry and become more anxious (and I accept that sometimes things aren’t that simple). Keep A Journal But not necessarily everyday. If something is bothering you, write down what’s bothering you and why. Not only will writing this down be a release, you might also be able to identify patterns of behaviour/triggers, which could help you move forward to feeling better about yourself. I’ll always say, I’m not an expert, just somebody who has given these things a try and they have helped. They might be able to help you too. But don’t just take my word for it, the below articles talk about the same; The Simple Habit That Will Change Your Life 10 Ways To Worry Less On a roll with the reading? Or fancy bookmarking something for later? Have a nosey at my last blog post ‘Feel The Fear And Do It Anyway’.",2017
Engineering your health,"When you are prescribed psychiatric drug, you may have the feeling that your doctor has no clue of what is going on with you. More too often the conclusion seems crystal clear: you suffer from depression, anxiety or another mood disorder. Does it make sense or are you faced with a one size fits all disease? Medicine has taken a huge part in our lives to such an extent that it is difficult for ordinary people to question its soundness. Through this blog post I am exposing my recent journey inside the darkness of depression, anxiety and constant fatigue. You will find below my story, why I refused classical medicine solutions and how I took control of my health. I must stress here that I’m not a doctor, what you read may be interpreted as advices but it is your responsibility to discuss them with your doctor. I am just sharing my thoughts about a delicate and complicated subject. It is up to the reader to end up with his own conclusion. First let’s start with my background. I am a 27 years old male. I would describe myself as pretty normal. I haven’t had any particular childhood trauma neither been severely injured so far. I have always had some mild anxiety (even though I didn’t know it back in my youth, it is now clear when I look at my past). Most of the time I was pretty calm and it was not impairing. It manifested mostly when I was under stress but nothing alarming, it was considered as a normal response. Nevertheless, everything span out of control about 2 years ago. I had a stable life and I was doing a job that I really liked. I had a good work-life balance, well paying job, and I had time to hang out and do the things I liked doing. I never felt so good about myself. However, within the span of a week, I felt my body capitulating without any apparent reason: I went from a good and joyful mood to a sad, depressive and anxious one. I was crying for no reason, having panic attacks without any apparent trigger. I did no longer enjoy the things I had always liked to do. My family and my friends were making me mad to the point where I needed to be alone. The sad truth is that it didn’t make me much calmer either. I was literally going through a nightmare. My brain was in frenzy state to find a solution to this nonsense. How can I feel so good about myself and then reach the perfect opposite in the span of a week? At that time I was looking for the common external factors: sleep, work, social life, … None of them was a striking eureka and I ended up to the conclusion that it comes and go and I would quickly become myself again. During the next 9 months, my health continued to deteriorate: muscles twitching all over my body, impairing lower back pain resistant to my physiotherapist, and many other symptoms (physical and mental) that I cannot remember. But the worst of all was undoubtedly the fact that I was no longer able to think clearly, the famous brain fog. I therefore decided to take action, I could no longer close my eyes on my deteriorating health. I took the difficult decision to quit my job to rest some time at home hopping it would help. Guess what? nothing changed, unless the fact that I therefore had no job and a limited time to get back to a normal health (fortunately I was able to save some money before resigning). Seriously, it seemed that something was totally wrong and I didn’t have the key to restore my old self. It was just time to consult a doctor. Even though I didn’t present all the symptoms, my general practitioner told me I had depression. According to him the physical symptoms I had were psychosomatic and everything would fade away once we get my mind fix. He made me consider taking antidepressant and anxiolytic to calm my mind, another drug for my muscle twitching and cramps, another drug for my back pain, and on and on. It was the festival: every symptom had its drug. It did not make sense to me: Are we just fixing the consequences or are we fixing the cause? Well, this is the issue, we don’t know the cause so we treat the symptoms. I discussed with him the pros and cons of the drugs he wanted me to take and I judged it was not worth the try: what if I become addicted to the drugs? Everyone has an example of someone around him (family, friend, colleague) taking these kinds of drugs and who ended up addicted to the point he cannot live without (and in the worst case scenario the drug had not worked). To be clear: I am not saying that psychiatric drugs are useless. I am just saying that in my situation I felt that it did not make sense to use them. I don’t have an extensive knowledge about these and I assume they are efficient towards certain conditions. As my general practitioner was not answering my questions, I decided to be proactive to find more natural solutions. My interest rapidly shifted towards nutrition. Even though I always had a balanced diet it may not had been that optimal. My first read on the subject was The UltraMind Solution by Mark Hyman. The author states that most of our brain issues are in fact due to our poor nutrition. He advise therefore to take vitamins regularly to balance what we cannot get in our food. His thesis resonated with me and I introduced his recommendations in my lifestyle (look at the conclusion for the details): I started taking vitamins, exercising 3 times a week (instead of 1 previously) and practicing meditation daily. Within 2 months I witnessed that my health was slowly improving: the back pain disappeared and I experienced less frequent brain fog. I was frustrated at the time because even though my health was improving, I was still feeling depressed. I stumbled upon another book: The Mood Cure by Julia Ross. The author states that we can fix our mood imbalance by taking some amino acids (this point is also mentioned in the UltraMind solution but without much details). I therefore added tryptophan and theanine (2 amino acids known to calm anger and anxiety) to my daily vitamin intake. The effects were quick and very positive. I took these aminos for 2 months until I could not see any more improvement from them. The author opinion is that they can help to restore balance, but we do not need to take them more than 3 months in a row. After that I still continued my daily vitamins. I also read a book about controlling our negative feelings (no supplement, just mind exercise): Feeling Good by David D. Burns. It gives precise exercises to follow to improve your mood. Although it’s an interesting book, it was not effective in my case. If you suffer from anxiety like I did, I also recommend you to read Dare by Barry McDonagh. This book is still a huge help to me. Today it has been 10 months since I started implementing the recommendations given by Mark Hyman. I am still not at 100% but I have made great progress and I am getting better everyday. My goal while writing this blog post was to point out the fact that sometimes it may be wiser to look for natural solutions instead of using drugs. We should first start controlling our nutrition and our lifestyle before considering drugs. Unfortunately, many doctors do not share this point of view. “Let food be thy medicine and medicine be thy food.” Hippocrates You may recognize yourself through my story, however, what worked for me may not exactly work for you. Everyone is different. The advice that I can give you is to read the books I mentioned and understand what is going on. You have to be educated on your condition and you cannot use your doctor as a black box not knowing how he reaches his conclusions. Nowadays, doctors agree on the fact that we are short on some of the vitamins and minerals (mainly vitamin D, K, Omega 3 and magnesium) and that a vitamin cure is advisable. It is your responsibility to talk about this to your doctor. Mine was not understanding on those subjects and I made a mistake not looking for another general practitioner. Below are the books I mentioned as well as the exact supplements I have been taking so far. I am not here to advertise but sharing my knowledge. I would have liked to find this kind of article 10 months ago when I started looking for solutions. I hope you had a pleasant reading. Do not hesitate to share your comments below. For a precise information about which supplements to take and the dosage, look at the UltraMind Solution. I am just giving you my personal formula as an illustration. They helped me reduce my anxiety. I am no longer taking them. I also use light therapy and I must say it helps a lot (checkout on Amazon to find the correct lamps).",2017
Countdown to College,"Like most college students, I have a love-hate relationship with my education, and going back to school after a long winter break fills me with a mixture of emotions. Maybe you’re dreading going back to school because you have to take a class with a terrible professor. As bad as that may be, you also know that it’s gonna feel so good to see all of your college friends again. One thing is for sure, this holiday break can make people feel anxious and even lost as we try to manage all of this free time. Yes, some people work over holiday break to make a little extra money, but the majority of college students even when working have more free time than during the academic year. this holiday break can make people feel anxious and even lost as we try to manage all of this free time College students over break resolve to do two things; hang out with friends, and relax. There’s nothing bad about relaxing, but what if there was something more that we could do with our time. What if instead of playing video games, binge watching Friends on Netflix, and sleeping in until noon that we decided to make a plan every day. The thing that differentiates our academic semesters from our breaks is the level of our intentionality. During the school year everything is intentional from the time that we eat, study, and wake up or go to bed. Over break though, we just wing it. We wake up when we want and do whatever we want when we feel like it. I don’t know about you, but my holiday break often feels like a waste of time. I learn and do virtually nothing significant beyond hanging out with friends and relaxing. And before I know it, it’s over. For years this is how I’ve spent my break and I’ve justified it by saying, “I need this time to relax.” The thing that differentiates our academic semesters from our breaks is the level of our intentionality As I’ve grown older I’ve become more and more anxious over any extended break from school. I think to myself when I’m lying in my bed at night, “was today another wasted day?” As strange as this may sound, the things I miss most about college aren’t just my friends or the parties, I miss the learning and challenges of it all. This is the problem I’ve encountered during my time off from school, I’m not being challenged and it fills me with anxiety and nervous energy. I’m not intentional with how I manage my time each day. I don’t wake up with a plan, I usually just wing it. And when I wing it, I do the things that bring me the most pleasure instead of making good use of these days I have off. All this to say, I want to change this faulty mindset and my unproductive behaviors. I don’t believe that the main purpose of a holiday break is to indulge every little desire and impulse. If we begin to see this extended time off as an opportunity to grow ourselves and express our creativity, then we will become less anxious and more satisfied on a day to day basis. Here’s what I‘m going to be intentional about for the next two weeks, and I challenge you to do the same. These are just examples of the things I want to do, but I encourage you to make your own unique list. Having goals like these can help you to be less anxious and feel more satisfied with life. Just because you are on break does not mean you should just “wing it,” but instead be intentional. None of this is to say that you shouldn’t watch TV or hang out with old high school friends, but make sure you allow yourself a few hours every day to be intentionally productive. I know without a doubt that implementing these strategies will better prepare you for the spring semester and will make your break even more enjoyable. Have a great day!",2017
Nocturnal Episodes,"I wake up with increasing regularity between 2:24am and 4:00am with my heart racing and realize I’m having a panic attack. This is unusual. Not the panic attack of course. I have lived with anxiety for over a decade but the “sneak-up-on-me-during-my-sleep” assault is entirely new. In fact, I had no idea you could actually get jolted awake by stress hormones. What’s up with that? How can I be dreaming of eating strawberry cupcakes one minute and the next moment find myself awake, heart pounding? Here’s what I know: My mind is a horse with wild eyes. It bucks and kicks. And I don’t always get to hold the reins. The kind of panic attacks I have wrestled with in the past, always happened during daylight hours (usually before Big Important meetings or on long hikes in the mountains without bear spray). Now the beast has turned nocturnal. It’s inconvenient to say the least. I repeat Lao Tzu’s wisdom to myself out loud: “If you’re depressed you’re living in the past. If you’re anxious you’re living in the future. If you’re at peace you’re living in the present.” I rein the beast in with a drop of lavender oil and long deep breaths. I am still awake by 5am. But calmer.",2017
Tired.,"OK, real talk. I’m tired of fighting. I’m tired of feeling shitty all the time. I’m tired of always reading the situation, watching and waiting for anxiety to pounce. I’m tired of depression ruining a good week. I’m tired of feeling short-tempered and cranky because my moods change so frequently and intensely.",2017
What to do if you’re having a panic attack.,"If you’re having a panic attack right now, I’m so sorry. It’s truly horrible. I have survived over 1,000, so I’d like to share some tips that have helped me. They may or may not work for you, but anything is worth a go, right? This article is aimed at people who know that they suffer from panic attacks and have ruled out other medical conditions that may be causing their symptoms. If you are unsure, please see your GP. The chances are your body is really tense right now, and that is only going to fuel the anxiety. The first thing to do is tackle your breathing because there’s a good chance you are over-breathing (probably without realising) and that leads to hyperventilation which can cause some of the nasty symptoms you might be experiencing, e.g. chest pain, dizziness, being unable to catch your breath, heart palpitations, feeling sick, tingling etc. These symptoms are real and alarming, so no wonder you’re freaking out. But there is a physical reason behind them and it’s not that you’re dying. There are lots of breathing exercises out there, but the one I find easiest to remember and do in these situations is to try and breathe out for two seconds longer than you breathed in. This will increase the CO2 in your blood and reduce the symptoms of hyperventilation. You can achieve the same effect by breathing into a paper bag, but honestly who ever has a paper bag on them?! (Top tip: airplane sick bags are awesome for this if you happen to be mid-flight). At the same time, do whatever you can do relax the muscles in your body. Your shoulders are probably up around your ears right now. Drop those shoulders! Massage your face! Stroke your ears. Whatever works for you. Remove any constricting clothing. I’m talking bra, ties, that kind of thing. A weird thing I like to do is go to the bathroom (my place of refuge in these times), wet some tissue with cold water and dab it on my forehead and back of my neck. The coolness works wonders. I also find drinking peppermint tea really helpful. For a start, you can’t hyperventilate when you’re drinking — it’s physically impossible. Also it’s really settling on the stomach, which can shut down when you’re stressed. If you don’t like peppermint tea, then drink water, or anything decaffeinated. I find being dehydrated can bring on symptoms too. Once you’ve started to tackle the physical symptoms (and you will need to work on this continually — keep those shoulders down, slow that breathing!), you need to be really kind to yourself and talk to yourself in a gentle and reassuring voice and say things like: I am fine. I am going to be fine. This will pass. I feel like hell but it’s okay. I will get through this. I will be okay. And repeat. And you really have to try to believe it. Easier said than done, I know. But practise. You’ll get better at it. Another thing you can do is distract yourself. Preferably with something mundane that occupies your brain in a mindless way. Like counting bathroom tiles, counting backwards from 100, going through the alphabet and trying to think of animals or countries or foods etc that start with the letters. Do anything to take your mind off your symptoms. If you really feel desperate and scared, and trust me I completely understand this, you have a couple of options: If you find yourself in this joyous club, please don’t despair. You are not alone, and you can learn to manage the condition and enjoy a fulfilling life, even if you carry on having attacks. I expect a lot of people reading this article will be shocked to read that I have this problem because I don’t really talk about it. — not because I’m embarrassed, but because there’s really no need to. I don’t let it limit me or guide my decisions (though this wasn’t true at the beginning) and I can handle life just as well as the next person. I would hate for anyone to treat me differently. But I wanted to ‘come out’ because I know it’s something that affects a lot of people and it’s really distressing and if my experience can help in any way, then it’s worth it. Anyway, here are some great things you can do to manage your panic attacks long-term: As I said earlier, if you’re unsure if you’re having panic attacks or not, get yourself checked out medically first to make sure it’s not something else. That way you’ll have a better chance of believing yourself when you’re trying to reassure yourself. I do know what it’s like trying to believe doctors when they say there’s nothing wrong though. I hope this helps anyway. I’d love to hear your feedback. And if you need support and want someone to talk to, I’m here. I might not be able to message back straight away, but I’ll try to come back to you eventually. Hugs, health and sympathy. You will get through this.Frances xxx",2017
A New Kind of Better,"Most stories I’ve read or heard about dealing with mental illness feature people who get back to their previous lives and professions. There are even those who are superheroes, becoming best-selling writers, law professors, psychiatrists, Hollywood stars, or network news anchors . Dr. Elyn Saks started to exhibit signs of schizophrenia while a Rhodes scholar in Oxford. She describes full-blown psychosis and hospitalizations, all the way through Yale Law School. Whereas the majority of people with schizophrenia are severely disabled by the illness, Saks ends up a tenured law professor who was able to come ‘out’ about her illness and write a best-selling account of her story. I understand that such stories are supposed to make us feel inspired to think that we too can rise from the ashes and become super-achievers, or at least successful NPR commentators. But the fact is that many lives, including mine, get derailed by mental illness, and don’t return to their previous path. Many people don’t get completely “better”, but rather have endless ups and downs. Others, like me, find a new “better” that they never would have imagined for themselves. Picture someone who returns from war in a wheelchair, with no hope of ever walking again. It might be inspiring to meet someone who has been able to walk again, but it might also be soul crushing, when what she really needs is to meet someone who has learned to be happy in a wheelchair. Another key feature of stories I have read, heard, lived and seen portrayed in the media: the sufferers go through a lot of pain, but they, and I, are still ridiculously privileged, and usually white. We have understanding families, access to hospitals, therapy and medication. The main hurdle in these stories is agreeing to seek help. It is a given that help is there to be had. When in fact millions of people with mental illness don’t have access to good care and support — returning veterans with PTSD, children from lower-income families without health insurance, young men and women who get put in prison rather than given mental healthcare. The largest mental hospital in Los Angeles is a jail. And let’s not forget that many of the homeless have untreated mental illness, and that many people self-medicate with alcohol or drugs. Aren’t all these people deserving of care and respect as well, to ‘get their lives back’? Although I had some symptoms starting at around age ten, I was able to graduate from Stanford and work in the Clinton Administration for several years. Then I had a hypomanic episode in which I went off my antidepressants. Everything came crashing down. I spent six months huddled on my mother’s couch in agony, wanting something to kill me. I didn’t even have the energy to kill myself. I lost all interest or capacity for climate change policy, my field. The thing that finally brought me somewhat back to life was dance, something I’d always done for fun but never considered a career possibility. A wonderful choreographer invited me to join her dance company, and pushed me into teaching children. Aerobic activity is a good antidepressant, and I was moving more than 20 hours a week. Dance brought me into the present moment and away from my despair. I also felt I was contributing something to the kids I taught. So I became somewhat functional, but I needed therapy four times a week, had a disastrous personal life, and felt anxious and depressed most of the time that I wasn’t dancing. I felt I had fallen so far from the life I had imagined for myself, of changing the world and running with the big guys. After a few years I became actively suicidal and checked myself in to the hospital. In what seemed to other people an ill-advised act, I impulsively moved to Nicaragua to be with someone I barely knew. The environment there turned out to be just what I needed. I started doing performance art, building furniture, making friends, and founding a craft project with families who lived in the dump. I felt alive again, free from the expectations I had of myself in the United States. I realized that the structure of society in the US was part of what was making me sick — the pressure to succeed, the hyper-consumerism, the complexity of everything. I did better in Nicaragua with daily power outages, slow internet, lack of clean water, and the absence of WalMart than I did in the USA. Tragically, in my third year in Managua I had a terrible car accident, killing two pedestrians. I do not remember anything from the accident, and I don’t know how it happened. Of course the horror of it consumed me. I arrived back in the US destroyed, and ended up in the hospital several more times. I even tried electro-shock treatment when no medications were helping me. That didn’t work either, though it did do long-term damage to my memory. I loved the few moments between when they put the mask on my face and when I passed out. It was a delicious floating sensation, detached from myself. I had a psychotic episode for several days during which I saw and heard things that weren’t real and couldn’t feed myself. My senses were heightened, so that going to the grocery store was an overwhelming cacophony of images, decisions, and sounds. I painted the phrase “my skin is thinner now” down my arm. I couldn’t use the phone, interact with strangers in public, and I definitely couldn’t drive. Again I moved toward creativity to find my way back to sanity. I enrolled in an art school in Barcelona. Although I missed most of the classes due to my fractured mental state, it gave me a structure to start making work. I made a performance in which I rolled very slowly through a field of eggs, prompting viewers to notice not only the cracked eggs, but how many remained whole. It was about trauma, impacts, destruction, and resilience. In another performance I asked members of the public to write on my skin all the things I could be stigmatized for, from being mentally ill, to Jewish, to being a rape survivor. Before selfies were a thing I did a series of self-portraits first thing in the morning, when my depression tended to be the worst. I put them all together in a huge self-portrait. Making art helped me process my mental health issues, and sharing it with other people helped them open up too. I started to perform in festivals and galleries, in Madrid, Sevilla, Paris, London and Belgrade. I started to feel like I had a purpose. I moved to the Dominican Republic, where I experimented with collage, painting, installation and sculpture. I had exhibitions. I performed in India, Zimbabwe, Senegal, Northern Ireland, Colombia, Chile, Mexico and more. I had an exhibition called “Medication,” about how complex pills can be. Art saved my life, as it has done over and over. Living outside the US also helped a lot. I still take a lot of medication, and drift in and out of therapy. I’m not saying that other people with mental illness should become artists or move to another country, but I am suggesting that other people suffering with major depression, bipolar disorder or PTSD consider seeking activities, careers and environments that help move toward health. Medication and therapy are important, but that’s not all there is to it. It’s worth considering that the illness isn’t all coming from inside you, that it’s being provoked in part by the society we live in. Those of us who have only lived in big cities may not realize how different life could be in a small town. Or that it’s not a good idea to spend hours on social media if it makes you feel terrible about yourself. Or that the US is not actually the center of the world, and doesn’t corner the market on the best way to live. I thought the motto of my craft project in Nicaragua, “no one is disposable,”referred to the families who scavenged in the dump, but now I realize it was also a declaration about myself and other people with mental illness. The Americans with Disabilities law provides for “reasonable accomodations” in the workplace and in academic settings. The law is much better than nothing, but many necessary accomodations don’t qualify as “reasonable,” meaning that they interfere with normal operations. For example, if I have crippling depression in the mornings (which is common in the disease) I would not reliably be able to show up for work until after 11am. So many people with mental illness are sidelined, and not being able to work not only robs them of income, but of a sense of purpose crucial to maintaining a will to live. I moved back to the US in August 2016 to start art school. Soon after arriving I started having panic attacks on the freeway, even though I wasn’t the one driving. I developed a massive body pain syndrome and couldn’t sit through class. I worried that it was all a big mistake to try this. Luckily my system calmed down after a few weeks. I feel like being here is a huge triumph that I never could have imagined ten, five or even two years ago. I still have symptoms, and I know I have to be careful, and that I can’t try everything that my classmates might do. I am not one of the superheroes of mental illness. I am keenly aware of my privilege, all the access I have and had to support, treatment and options, and how hard it was for me to gain stability even with so many advantages. I am aware of my limitations, and I am extremely grateful every day that I want to be alive.",2017
"Anxious Teen? Screen time, isolation and anxiety are a real danger — for most of us","It’s a love / hate affair that I justify and rationalize using words like “work” and “email” and “messages” from clients and family and friends. Oh, trust me, I do my share of work from my iPhone, but far more time is spent managing multiple social media pages, scrolling mindlessly through the life-sucking vortex that is Facebook (like I said, love/hate affair) and determining what new content I could post that will teach, inspire, encourage others and showcase all the cool and wonderful things that are happening in my life. I agonize over my words and hashtags, and reach and the potential of each post. I spend hours responding to emojis and one word comments and feel deflated and sickened by the comments feed on posts that roll through my timeline. I don’t spend much time reading them, and I don’t pour gasoline on the fire — but they’re there — and I see them — and sometimes those online arguements make me question our capacity as humans to interact and get along. I quietly creep others, I admire or envy. I pay attention to drama and breakups and challenges and hardships. My senses have been assaulted by images of brutal fights and abused animals and I’ve cried over videos of soldiers coming home and “don’t text and drive” commericals. I watch funny cat videos occassionally, and Ellen clips once in a while, but the poisonous tends to over-rule the rest. Political unrule, savage personal choice debates and hard conversations that have no place happening over a keyboard dominate my on-line world right now, and I can’t help feel overwhelming, and a bit hopeless sometimes. I’m self-reliant, mature, well-adjusted. I’ve battled my demons. I know who I am. I have a strong circle of friends and a supportive spouse and a job I am good at. I’m confident in who I am and in my body. I accept my quirks and limitations and recognize I can be different, and still be utterly loveable. Yet too much social media can leave me feeling empty, vacant and, once-in-a-blue moon, misunderstood. My fourteen year old daughter has been struggling. She feels lonely and awkward. She has a very small friendship circle and worries about being abandoned and ‘losing people’. She doesn’t “like herself”, her weight and her eyebrows. She feels unseen and unworthy and unloveable. All normal, you say? Yeah, age appropriate, totally. Before you criticize my parenting (unlimited screentime), it’s actually not unlimited. We have timers set on both our daughter’s devices. Depending on the day of the week, there is no access to wi-fi, and it’s off every night before 10. They tell me, “none of my other friends have limits!” (huge sigh, and groan) My girl is self-conscious. And anxious. I can see her anxiety rise while she scrolls Instagram and checks her stories on Snapchat. She has told me before: “When I feel anxious, I’m wondering what I might see about me? What is someone saying about me?” When she is not allowed to use the wi-fi to “connect” — I see her anxiety rise. Afterall, that’s where everyone is. I try to explain: the trouble with the photos and stories you’re seeing is that they aren’t real life. They are the parts of people’s lives that they want you to see. No one ever looks alone or lonely because they want to show their life is amazing. They are only ever posting 1 tiny second of a moment as a photo. (And maybe it’s the best picture out of 31 others taken in order to share.) It doesn’t console her. She’s convinced she is the only girl unlovable enough to not be in sunny, happy party photos with a group of cool kids. It’s lonely. And isolating. And creates desperation. And increases anxiety. And incites and aggravates depression. We have no idea what social media use means for developing brains and selves. It is a global experiment currently in progress. We don’t yet have significant proven studies on the effects of screens and sleep and brain waves. We don’t know how children develop without conversations and connections and the practice of face-to-face relationships and dialogues; how they manage confrontation and disagreements without hiding behind emojis and text. We have no clue how dangerous social media use is for young people. Yeah, yeah, not all young people. Yet, I’d guarantee more teens are struggling with the emotional fall out of extended social media use than are highly adapted and capable of managing it successfully. What’s worse is having parents who are so busy working and scrolling and liking and commenting and playing games and texting that we are missing the signals. She needs me, now more than ever. In a world that feels distant and unattainable even though it is right in front of our eyes, making heart and eye connections and leading our kids is absolutely critical. Time to put my phone down.

We can’t all be Atlas,"When I opened my eyes, the light was on. I could tell it was still dark outside, but I couldn’t recognize the room around me. There was a man standing in the corner. He was featureless and completely black, like a shadow. He didn’t move. I couldn’t move. My eyes were searching around the room. I looked down and saw blood all over my hands, but I couldn’t work out where it was from. I became aware of my body being filled with an unshakeable certainty that I was going to die. To most people who have suffered from panic attacks before, this feeling of life-threatening dread will be all too familiar. Yet it remains impossible to describe to those on the outside. Sometimes it can creep up on you, swelling and swelling until you can no longer hold it in. Or it can hit you fast and hard, like a car crash. It could happen anywhere: in an elevator, in a crowded supermarket aisle, walking down the street. Every little fiber in your body is screaming, telling you to run. And sometimes, the episodes can visit you in your dreams. I’d had nightmares before, but nothing had filled me with the primal fear I had experienced in that room. Half awake, half asleep. Nothing was real. My bedroom was unfamiliar. But I experienced every little emotion, every rise and fall in terror like I was still awake. I couldn’t breathe. I was convinced something was trying to kill me. I was living by myself at the time, so I awoke crying from my panic attack at 4 A.M., alone in a cold, dark room and 200 miles away from my family. I went about the rest of my day, but I couldn’t shake the night terror from my mind. I’m not “crazy,” I have severe anxiety. I was always a creative child. Even today, I can conjure up worlds, people and situations so easily in my mind that they almost dance before my eyes. But, like a deal made with a strange witch in a fairytale wood, there’s a cost that comes with having such an overactive and often out-of-control imagination. Just as my mind can create stories full of fairies, elves and whatever else my pre-teen self was occupied with, it can also create monsters. The shadow creeping out from under my bed was a sharp-toothed clown. That noise coming from the boiler in the cupboard was a vengeful robot made of rusty tin cans with knives for hands. Some of the thoughts were understandably upsetting, like the anxiety I dealt with when my parents separated, for example. Others were so overtly ridiculous that I can’t help but laugh at them now. As a kid, I used to panic every time an ambulance drove past me on the street. I’ve heard from other people that they also jump to scary conclusions such as, “maybe it’s my loved one,” but my second thought was always “but what if I got run over by a car and I’m dead, and I just don’t know it yet?” As I grew into adulthood, the elves became lofty aspirations and the frightening clowns became an overwhelming fear of failure, amongst many other things. The anxiety has always been there, but it wasn’t until I moved into the busy metropolis of London that it became unbearable. Walking past any group of people was an impossible task. Any sound of laughter must have been at my expense. I loved my lectures, but seminars were my special idea of hell. It felt like my mind had been enveloped in one thick, grey cloud. There are always lots of thoughts constantly rushing through my mind, but I can never pick out a single one. The possibilities and opportunities that my imagination gave me were being destroyed by this dark illness, and no one seemed to understand how serious it was. One of the biggest issues about growing up with anxiety without knowing you have it is that it begins to blur the line between what is normal and what is unhealthy. It wasn’t until seeing a therapist did I realize my need to constantly present myself well was yet another physical symptom. Small quirks that have always been there, like walking with my eyes on the floor, biting my nails, and not being able to sit still meant that anxiety has partly shaped who I am as a person. But that was just the beginning. After a year in London with money troubles, arguments and difficulty adjusting, we found out that one of the most important people in my world had cancer. When I opened up to my therapist about it, he told me I was describing my trauma to him as if I was describing a chair. Anxiety had taught me to be obsessed with self-managing and hiding my emotions so well that I had literally forgotten how to feel them around other people. Looking back, I see that was the point where I began to spiral too far. The anxiety became overtly physical. It felt like I had been staring at a bright, glaring computer screen for too long, and my eyes couldn’t concentrate on one thing. I was having multiple anxiety episodes pretty much every day. For me, a panic attack begins when my neck, wrist and arms feel tingly. There are pins and needles in my legs. My whole body suddenly gets hot and I start sweating. This can happen because I got a call from an unknown number, because someone keeps sending me messages when I am already busy, or because there are suddenly too many people in an elevator. It feels like always being on the brink of tears. I can’t sit still in a meeting, my feet are constantly moving and I start picking at the skin on my finger. It feels like being sat in a restaurant, and tearing a napkin into a thousand, tiny white pieces. Like scratches on my wrist where nails have dug in too hard. Like I’ve forgotten how to take long, deep breaths. When it’s really bad, I can’t move my hands or arms without shaking. My heart is burning a hole in my chest. Heartbreak feels physically painful. Insults bite like bullets and hurt crawls along my skin in prickly goosebumps. I feel lightheaded and nauseous. I want to run but I can’t move, and I don’t have anywhere to go anyway. My back aches, but I haven’t left the house in three days. It feels like a desperate need to be safe but not knowing where to find that safety since an anxiety attack can come from anywhere; in the middle of my seminar in front of 10 complete strangers, alone in my room or out for drinks with my closest friends. It feels like not knowing if I want to be alone or surrounded by people I love the most, and suddenly doubting that those people love me back. It feels like everything in the world is wrong and alien, and I feel numb. It was at the climax of all of this that those childhood monsters came to visit me again. There were nights when I was so sleep deprived that they appeared as hundreds of spiders crawling across my walls, jolting me back awake just as I was about to drift off. If anyone ever tells you that anxiety is just a problem of the mind, it’s impossible to explain just how wrong they are. Anxiety isn’t just a mental illness. For some like me, it can become so out of control that it takes on its own physical form. After a year of crippling, wildly uncontrollable anxiety, it became clear that the best thing I could do was go home. Over the next few months, my anxiety simmered down to a manageable temperature. With each walk through my familiar hometown, another spider began to crawl away. My nails began to grow back. The dark bags under my eyes softened, and I ate real food. I wrote real essays and started numerous new projects. The tin-can robot retired back to his cupboard and the shadow man disappeared. There is no clown under my bed, just the resolute remains of an anxiety-monster that made my life unliveable for two long years. I don’t think it will ever go away, but neither will the lessons I learned about fighting, survival and resilience. Submissions are closed.",2017
Transforming Your Anxiety,"He had reached out a few days earlier to the partners at his company to talk with them about stake in the company. He was waiting for their response and imagining scenarios over and over in his mind, most of which were negative. He also had a recreation flag football playoff game coming up with a team that plays dirty. He really wanted to win and play well, especially because he was going to be going away for the weekend with some of his teammates. He was feeling more anxious than usual about the game. One thing I noticed that he was doing was conflating the two events, so we worked on breaking them down separately. The next thing we did was reviewed his thoughts and feelings about both the job and the game. On my end, I normalized the fact that he was anxiously anticipating the big game and wanting to play well. When he spoke about it, he described it as ‘stupid’ that he was feeling anxious about a recreational football game. I disagreed and told him I didn’t think it was stupid at all and that the act of dismissing his feelings about it only served to complicate the anxiety he was feeling. In terms of the job, I asked him how he was feeling about taking the big step to approach the partners. I read the letter that he wrote to them and it was eloquent and positive and reasonable. He was advocating for himself and realized if he didn’t do that that it would lead to resentment and regret. I asked him if there is anything else that he can do that he’s not doing to help his cause and he said no. It was out of his hands at that point. Same goes for the game. He was prepared and was going to try his best, but he couldn’t control how the other team played or how his teammates played. So, for both situations, we talked about what was in his control versus what wasn’t. Focusing on what we cannot control feeds anxiety. I encouraged him to meditate and visualize the response he hoped for from the partners and visualize how he wanted to play because our thoughts influence our actions and our overall mindset. The other thing that feeds anxiety is trying to get rid of it. No one likes to feel anxious, but when we try to push it away it makes it worse. Also, when we judge or dismiss our feelings, it just makes them worse. We need to work on acknowledging, understanding and making space for what he feels. That process alone will reduce the anxiety as opposed to trying to get rid of it, which creates the opposite effect. I emphasized that all these things are easier to say and understand than to put into practice. The process of putting it into practice is messy and will have ups and downs. I warned him against creating unfair expectations that he should be able to press a button and execute now that he has read the program. It doesn’t work that way. Ultimately, it’s what we don’t get, or what doesn’t go our way that forces and challenges us to grow, learn and adapt in more meaningful ways. Of course, it’s nice to get the win and for things to work out the way we want it. Either way it’s winning. It depends in large part on how we approach it. So if you have something that is causing you anxiety try to identify what it is and why. Try to separate out what you can do to advocate for yourself versus what is outside of your control. Work on recognizing when the anxiety is there and telling yourself that it’s ok to feel what you’re feeling. Rinse and repeat.

Uncontrollable Stress #1,"There are times when I choose to do things that inconvenience other people. At those times, it’s not my responsibility to care for what the other person thinks or feels. Certainly I can choose to be respectful of the other person and treat them politely. But that doesn’t mean I have to pander to them or even that I must apologise for my actions. What I can do is the thing I need to. What I can’t do is change what someone else thinks about me. If I am to remain healthy for my family; if I am to be alert enough to do my job; if I am to have the energy and brain space to be useful around my home, then I must plan times when I can separate myself from others. I need to have time out. I don’t have to apologise for that. I don’t need to explain myself. I don’t have to apologise for needing food. And I don’t have to apologise for needing time out. Other people may think I’m being selfish or prioritising the wrong things. So what? I can’t control what they think. But I can control what I do. What I can’t do is change what someone else thinks about me. I can have a different opinion to you. And you can have a different opinion to me. We can differ in opinion and it’s okay. I can control my own opinion – I can think and reason and research and come to a conclusion. What I can’t control is what you think of me. There’s no guarantee I’ll change what you think about me by arguing with you or presenting evidence or fighting you or ignoring you or sitting in a funk in the corner feeling sorry and angry. I can’t control what you think about me. But I can control what I think about something and what I do. One of the worst things to happen to anyone is a smear campaign. Having your reputation tarnished in public is a horrible situation to be in. I know. I’ve been there. And you know what? You and I have no control over what anyone says about us. We have no control. But we do have control over how we behave, what we say, how we say it. We have control over whether we seek out a confidant to talk things through with. We have control over whether we go for a brisk walk right now. We have control over how we do our work, when we go to bed, taking time out, holding to our opinions and enjoying this moment in whatever way we can. A counsellor once combatted every objection I made with the words, “So what?” So what if other people think you’re lazy? So what if they get offended? So what if you have to take longer to get something done? So what if driving slower makes you a little late? So what? So what? So what? What other people think about me is beyond my control. So why live as if they have control over me at all? I am the only agent of change in my life. That’s something I can control. If you’d like other people to be blessed through this writing, like you were (okay, so I’m going out on a limb when I say that), I invite you to lick the Recommend heart icon down below. To the left a little. Yes. That one. And you read me right – I invite you to lick it. Here are some other articles you may be interested in: Oh, hey. Did I mention the heart icon down below?

Everything is a BIG Deal,"As I didn’t work, I lounged around, knowing I should go to the grocery store. The grocery store is 4 MINUTES away. Why is it such a big deal? Yesterday, my courses released a new module to do, which I still haven’t looked at. I still have time, but why am I putting it off? The answer, must be anxiety and stress. It sounds ridiculous even to myself, but it doesn’t go away even if I know it’s irrational. Linedancing is a bit out of my comfort zone in general, I’m not coordinated in the slightest. Why is it okay to do it with a friend but not by myself? The only answer is anxiety. I imagine the awkwardness of trying to follow everyone and laughing at myself awkwardly, which is cool when you have someone to laugh with. But I prefer if I’m going to suck out like a sore thumb, to at least do it with a friend. Going to the grocery store is so ordinary it’s hard to think why it matters. I do the same thing with getting gas. I try to do it when it’s convenient, but sometimes your fridge or gas tank is pretty much empty and you’re forced to go. Even though there’s more selection at the two grocery stores 10 minutes away, I chose to go to the 4 minute away one, so I wouldn’t have to talk to anyone I know. Why do I even care? I don’t know!!! I drive myself crazy! Lastly, I joined four online courses for fun, to learn, and because they are free. Why did I stress myself out? The thing is, when I joined half of the lessons were already posted, so I did them all at once, because I’m a binger. I’d rather use an entire day and accomplish a lot, than do a little bit every once in a while. This one, I can’t really explain. What I did accomplish today though was sweeping the floors, eating all meals (which has been rare lately), I created a couple games for tutoring, I got those stinkin’ groceries, and I vacuumed my couches! I think I deserve a gold medal for partial initiative and procrastination, all in the same day. Go me!",2017

Fears That Are Not Your Own,"(Originally posted on my old wordpress December 19th, 2015) There are days when my brain does this thing. It takes all the work that I’ve done over the past months/years and tear it all down to nothing. To rubble, to ash. Days where my anxiety acts like this separate entity and makes the day really, really bad. It opens the doors that I closed a long time ago in the face of insecurities, weaknesses that I had. This is not something new that happens. It has happened all my life. It feels like a giant leap back, but earlier this week it was even worse. My insecurities triggered some that Partner S had. My grief, my anxiety, and my brain betrayals are no longer my own concern. I’ve been with Partner S for 6 years now, and they have always been the support when I broke down. They were there to assure me that everything was going to be alright, because they had the confidence that it would. This time though, it brought something new into the mix. I was having an intense jealous moment. It hadn’t happened before this. Partner S had a girlfriend, and they have been dating for about 3 months. Leading up to them dating, I worked through every scenario possible in my head. S gave me every opportunity, before diving in to their new relationship, to throw up the stop sign. I had no fears. I knew this was a good step and I could see how much S liked this person. But, a scenario came up that I hadn’t planned for, and it hit me like a brick. Jealousy, anxiety, self doubt and self hate all bubbled up in one evening. I was scared, scared at what I was feeling, and S sensed it. It made their own fears bubble up. Fears that I was finally putting up the stop sign. I’ve been reckless with my anxiety, because I’ve always known that S would be there. And they still were there, but it dissolved into a couple of panic attacks, tears, and a few hours of reassuring each other that this was just a moment. Just a moment in time, and the feelings were not something that were permanent. The jealousy was not here to stay, and the fear was waning. The situation made me realize that S and my bubble has expanded now, and my fears and anxiety is no longer something we can keep confined to ourselves. My emotions affect S and their girlfriend. Emotions, fears, and yes, even jealousy are natural and needed. But it did me good to realize that they have a farther reach now. Everything has settled, and it was a valuable lesson in both how to make our polycule work, and also that I cannot plan for every damn thing.",2017
Subliminal holocaust,"I try not to be affected by the ugliness around me: the usurpation of functionality. ""But it is cheaper"" ""But it is practical"" ""But it is functional"" Maybe I'm sick. Maybe I'm right. Maybe both. I'm disgusted by the sight of these monoliths of nothingness called buildings. Is it all supposed to be a comic tragedy or a tragic comedy? Can someone fill me in? I'm sick by the fact that they are all built to pile up bodies whose souls have gone with the smoke under which they once burned. A subliminal holocaust… Sick but genius! I have to close the window to avoid seeing it. I have to open the window to breathe and let the light in. It is all so natural… It disturbs me… the naturalness of this new functionality. This new naturalness! I'm just one of the stacked bodies. But somehow I'm still alive. I'm sick, but I laugh. I don't know if at the comedy in the tragedy or at the tragedy in the comedy. But I laugh. It works! It is functional!",2017
How To Say Yes To Fear,"In 2016, I started a morning journaling process which involves setting aside a few minutes every morning to reflect on a set of questions. One of the questions I ask myself is, “what is stressing me out and what can I do to stop this?” This is a technique borrowed from Tim Ferriss (Tools Of Titans). Initially I was just doing it for the sake of the exercise. Over time, this accounting routine shed some new perspectives on my actions and decisions. Examples run across the whole gamut of my life. I was stressed about work and the ever increasing burden of chasing productivity and innovation. I was stressed about our investors and tenants. And as most Asian Americans can commiserate, I was stressed about being the perfect son, brother, cousin, filial piety, etc. The realization was that these thoughts consumed my consciousness and played a massive role in driving a majority of the decisions I was making. And that sent me on an existential journey to explore why. Why do we make so many of our decisions based on fear/avoidance instead of love/want? More importantly, how can we manage our fear so that we can rationally make big decisions? A half a year of browsing and interviewing psychologists and world experts has led me to piece together 3 mental tools that have made a drastic difference in managing my fear: Step 1. Acknowledgement — “I am scared and I want you all to know” The first step to managing fear is to simply acknowledge that it exists to yourself and if necessary, to your audience, and your greatest critics. This helps to produce two miraculous side-effects: Once you admit to the world that you ARE scared, you strip the power away from your critics (which often includes yourself). If the only ammunition that people have against you is your own fear, then proactively sharing that with the world eliminates their ability to harm you… leaving them with no option but to actually pay attention to the content of your work, the real you. This display of vulnerability can also improve your likeability scores. Studies have shown that strategic displays of weakness will actually increase your social standing. The psychology behind this phenomenon stems from our desire to empathize with other’s imperfections. This is illustrated in 1998, when Clinton admitted to his extramarital affair with Monica Lewinsky and his approval rating actually skyrocketed. This also explains why we fall in love with seemingly flawed characters like Don Draper (Mad Men), Homer Simpson, Michael Scott (The Office) and the list goes on. In acknowledging your fear, you’ll quickly learn that everyone is struggling with the same anxiety and your vulnerability creates a window for real human connections. Step 2. Rationalize Worst Case Scenario — “What’s the worst that can happen?” Another tool you can use to manage fear is to simply ask yourself “what is the worst thing that can happen?” This is a powerful question because it helps to address the misalignment between our reptilian brain and our modern existence. To illustrate this, let’s travel back in time 5,000 years and imagine that you’re standing in front of a saber tooth tiger. Your reptilian brain, which is this primitive and instinctive portion of your Central Nervous System, will instantly process 3 questions: And you’ll immediately start feeling adrenaline pumping through your veins. This is incredibly important 5,000 years ago because your survival depends on it. Now, let’s transport you back to today and you’re sitting in your boardroom teaming with lawyers, C-suites, and other powersuits. You’ve selected a seat way in the back corner of a room. Someone raised a question that you’re particularly interested/knowledgeable about but instead of confidently voicing your input, your reptilian brain kicks into gear. The same physiological response causes your heart to race, unable to tap into any intelligible thoughts because your body is worried about imminent danger. Here is where you’d want to ask yourself what’s the worst that can happen. You’re certainly not going to get attacked by a saber tooth tiger but we seemingly react in the same fashion. By examining the worst case scenarios, you’re short circuiting this response. The reality is that we’re living in a very safe and comfortable world. Let’s follow the trail of plausible worst case scenarios: You might get fired. You might not be able to afford living alone. You might have to move back in with your parents. You might have to live on unemployment benefits. If your parents are gone, you might need to stay at a shelter until you find a new job. It’s nowhere near as bad as getting your face chewed off by a tiger. This is a great exercise because it forces you to think fast and slow about the potential consequences which often isn’t as dire as you think it is. Step 3. Starving Your Fear — “I’ve rationalized my fear and I need to act” This is a key mental tool purported by Grant Cardone (10X Rule) and Jeff Bezos (The Everything Store). Fear feeds on time. In other words, the more time you spend ruminating on fear, the greater control it’ll dictate over you and your decisions. Once you’ve rationalized your worst case scenarios, you’ve got nothing left but to act. Bezos calls it a bias for action, a bias to actively pursue your wants rather than living a life of aversion and fear. Our struggle with fear has profound effects on our lives and wellbeing but it’s ever so present. Society is structured around fear. As a child, we are taught that if we don’t complete our assignments we’ll be punished with bad grades. If we don’t do our chores, we’ll be punished by our parents. If we don’t study for the SAT, you’ll be punished with rejection from top universities. If we don’t meet this deadline/quota, we’ll be fired and have to live in squalour. Our whole upbringing and existence is designed around fear so it’s actually common for everyone to feel disillusioned about the true impetus behind our lives. Lastly, it’s important to recognize that the tools outlined above aren’t a panacea but rather a starting point to living a more fearless existence.",2017
Asking for Help,"I have NEVER been good at asking for help. I always let it ( and, for the most part, still do) eat me up inside, causing literal, physical pain. Last night I was at a meeting. I was feeling nauseated, shaky, I knew I needed help. After the meeting, I reached out for help and not one, but 7 women came and sat with me for well over an hour. After that hour, I began to feel a bit better. Will I do that again? Eh, I’m not sure. Today I woke up to several texts checking on me. I had woken up around 11:30am. (I work 3p-11p). My head hurt, I felt sick, I had absolutely no desire to go to work. I work PRN, so I make my own schedule. I’m trying for 3 shifts a week. I’ll be off the other 4. Even 1 shift seems impossible at this point. The other day, I didn’t go into work. I didn’t call. I just didn’t show up. So, I’m really anxious (more so than usual) about going into work today. I, also don’t have the fucking energy to go in. I’m depressed. Tired. I just don’t have the damn strength in me. I can’t ask for help about this, it’s something I have to do. And I can’t tell you how much I’m dreading the fuck out of this shit.",2017
That friend & that trip around the city.,"Marquei de ver um amigo hoje. Queria simplesmente conversar com alguém durante essas férias e esvaziar a mente. Não sabia quem chamar pelo “simples” fato de não ter dinheiro, e geralmente esses programas saem caro, com cinema, comida, sempre tendo algo para fazer, para distrair. Quando esse amigo, que eu não via fazia dois anos e meio, mandou tarde da noite a mensagem tipo: “Oi, bora marcar de se ver? preciso cortar o cabelo.” Eu disse que sim, mas na verdade fiquei pensando no que a gente iria ficar conversando durante uma tarde inteira, mandei logo depois: “Quer assistir um filme?” e ele: “Não, tô sem dinheiro pra isso.” Eu ri, ok, somos dois, então vamos só andar? Ok. Encontrei com ele na parada de ônibus, andamos, conversamos sobre tudo, filmes, séries, família, “futuro”. Entramos numa barbearia que mais parecia um labirinto de homens engraçados dançando com toalhas na cabeça, o barbeiro dele era já um velho amigo, ficamos tagarelando sobre as viagens que fizemos na vida e as garotas que conhecemos e nem lembramos mais o nome, até alguém aparecer com um secador de cabelo e calar a nossa boca, …ele ficou na dúvida se fazia ou não a sobrancelha, e reclamou do corte. Saímos, andamos mais “um pouco,” fomos na minha escola, pegamos qualquer ônibus que fosse para o shopping, contamos o dinheiro na mesa, moedas no caso, tentávamos arrumar um jeito de ir pro centro da cidade, enquanto falávamos de religião e crença, acabamos pegando uma promoção de R$9,50 numa hamburgueria, o sanduíche tinha um gosto horrível a propósito. A cada minuto que se passava uma coisa ia levando a outra, e já estávamos uns 20 minutos na loja de cd’s, na pior sessão de músicas bregas. Até voltarmos a estação, sempre no fundo do ônibus, planejando o “casamento” dele com a garota que ele conheceu ano passado. Chegamos na estação procurando um chip por R$7,00, não achamos, fomos andando de novo para o shopping, até ele comprar qualquer chip, que nem era o que ele queria, voltamos para a estação, nos despedimos, voltei para casa e quando a abri a caixa de mensagens: “chegou bem?” ele mandou. Eu sei que vamos perder contato, porque as aulas vão começar de novo, e nós iremos ficar um ano sem se falar, talvez dois, até um de nós tomar coragem e marcar de viajar andando pela cidade…de novo.",2017
Understanding the Unconscious: Creating the environment to study it,"The unconscious, or our Back-End Processes, are quite adept at learning new skills. Choose a skill and observe what the unconscious does with it, however it tries to acquaint itself with it. Let go yourself, your mind — the conscious self. I understand it is easier said than done. But recall all those joyous moments when you might have been have dancing by swaying your body from left to right in joy upon hearing some good news such as great exam results or your friends throwing you a surprise birthday party. The thing is to let your inhibitions dissolve. The continual whispers of “I shouldn’t do this” or “I can’t do this” are self-created. These are perceptible in your head in the form of voiceless voices but actually their true form is formless. Their true form is that a pervasive fear that can be sensed throughout your body if you meditate, with eyes closed, upon each and every part of it. It’s mostly noticeable in the form of stiff, unrelaxed muscles, mostly in and around the neck,shoulder and upper back region. That’s why physical health is as important as mental. You don’t need to exert yourself much to remain healthy physically. Just repetitions is what it requires. A healthy mind is the flower of which a healthy body is the root. I only propose this because to create an ideal environment to study yourself — or anything for that matter — fear needs to be get rid of. You, your mind, needs to understand through and through that there is no cause to panic or be in the mode of alarm and that being composed wouldn’t cause you to miss out on anything. you need to realized that time passes and it’s okay and losing time is not a matter and even if it is, then not a life-threatening one, at least not in the comfort of your home or the peacefulness of your own solitude. This I advocate for those suffering from pangs of anxiety and panic attacks frequently. Fear is good because it helps you be cautious and it was what was required of our ancestors back when our species was mostly dependent on mostly foraging and hunting, You need to remember that our bodies and our beings are but nature’s machines and nature keeps changing us through the process of evolution but some old behavioral patterns as of now still remain. This sounds pseudo-scientific, i know, But the point i am trying to drive home is that once you start treating your body and mind objectively, once you get passionate enough to change yourself, you’ll mostly stop worrying about the quantity of personal progress you can make and start focusing on getting it right, no matter how many times you might have to try, i.e. the quality. Imagination is nothing but a tool, an ability we naturally possess. You can use it to relive your past mistakes and regrets and failures, and you can also use it to relive your past achievements, no matter how meager, according to you, they might have been. so why choose the former rather than the latter? Be proud of yourself! Your pride is your lance and your humbleness is your shield. I am not telling you to become an arrogant, self centered egomaniac. No! Be humble. Sure! But do set up your own boundaries. Know when to put your foot down. And when you do, just do it, You certainly can explain it to others if they ask for it, but no need to go into the details of why you did so, unless you really do feel that you can to that person. And yes, not everybody, or not a lot are going to be “that person”. Learn to balance your “yes”s and “no”s. With that as your aim, you’ll keep on the path of setting up boundaries for yourself. After all, all experiments and studies require control boundaries.",2017
On Anxiety and Love,"This is usually the moment when I pause to think. I close my eyes and mentally skim through my thoughts. Usually, I end up finding nothing worth my concern. This leads to me logically concluding that there is no reason to feel anxious. Then, the panic drifts away, and I resume going about my day. But this time, it’s different. I know it is because I’ve been feeling the same panic every time I start my day. It stings the most whenever I leave myself idle and let my mind wander. On most days, I manage to channel my thoughts towards something more productive. I run, hang wet clothes on the backyard clothesline, or brush off the creases as I make my bed. However, in the middle of these dull and monotonous activities lie pockets of empty time. That’s when it strikes. It amazes me how anxiety can creep up back into my system in just a few short minutes. The perfect villain, if you will. Perpetually watching, always ready to strike the moment you leave yourself idle for any amount of time. It is relentless, and it won’t stop. Unless, I somehow manage to deal with it directly. Anxiety is the shadow that insidiously grows as you tread the path towards the sunlight of life’s pursuits. It watched me as I slept through my first months adjusting to the harshness of independence and living abroad. And now, it hovers over me as I struggle to understand love. Love has been called many names and compared to many things. Some refer to it as a game, but with the decisiveness and precision of competitive chess. Two players, methodically consuming pieces of each another not for love, but victory. The loser is left shattered and broken while the other celebrates the satisfaction of keeping one’s heart intact, ready to pounce on the next challenge. Others see it more like two cogs, elegantly pushing and pulling on each other in a perpetual circular dance, moving the hands of time ever so slightly with each rotation. The simplicity of their existence is matched only with the clarity of their purpose. Both are content. Both are happy. As for myself, I see it more like a sadistic game of poker. And, instead of chips, I bet with emotional capital. Sometimes, even pieces of my heart. Unlike chess, there are three players on the table. And, as I play my hand, lose some rounds, and win others, I let myself get consumed with the exhilarating pace of the game. Eventually, I look up from my hand and towards the two other players. One, I spent moments I’ve genuinely cherished. The other, I barely knew. I then realise both of them have already cashed in together and left. I don’t know how many rounds ago. Then, I lay my cards down and wonder how much time I’ve spent gambling on my own. It’s not the first time I’ve been in this situation. And, I don’t think it will be the last. I have a bad habit of caring too much a bit too quickly. Most of the time you just end up twiddling your thumbs, waiting if that person will be ready to give a part of themselves in return. After all, it’s what you need to sustain yourself. It’s what allows you to keep on giving. But then, you realise that this person won’t. And, what hurts is that it’s not their fault. They may have liked the part that you have given to them. Maybe, even cherished it. But, they never asked for it. They don’t owe you anything. So, you run back to the dark corners of isolation. Maybe try and figure things out that way. But, days pass, and things aren’t getting any better. Then, one day you see a smile. Maybe, from a friend. Maybe from a stranger. You don’t know why, but somehow that makes you feel not so alone anymore. Isn’t strange how something so simple can gradually free you from the bonds you previously thought were inescapable? You’ll have days when you stumble as you try and reach for the glowing piece of hope anxiety likes to dangle just outside your grasp. But, you’ll pick yourself up. You always do. Time passes, and you manage to mould and fit together new pieces of yourself from the tragedy you went through. They may not fit the same way compared to the pieces you’ve lost. Maybe, they may even itch a bit. But somehow, they make you feel stronger. After all, these are now part of who you are. Anxiety and love go hand in hand. The former, albeit a bit sadistically, allows us to develop a deep longing for someone. It warns us when things are getting a bit stale. It paints our love with a fresh coat of perspective and gratitude. It helps keep things genuine, spontaneous, and fun. Young love has a bad habit of running into anxiety. Maybe, a bit more than it should. But, I wouldn’t have it any other way. It helps me stay sharp and encourages me to take a step back whenever I get in too deep. Sometimes you need to learn how to be alone again. Being with someone does add a bit more colour to life. But it’s not worth losing yourself in the process.",2017
Making Space for Anxiety,"There are so many articles that talk about getting rid of anxiety like its something separate from the human experience—something that can be easily removed if you simply tries hard enough. Anxiety isn’t a wall to climb over. It feels more like a circular track—like there is no end to it. There’s a problem with treating anxiety like there is a cure. If and when whatever prescription fails, it comes with guilt that you aren’t doing it right. Anxiety is like any other emotion and it helps to manage it rather than try to bury or extinguish it. The mind is like a house. It has many rooms, they are all connected with hallways and each room contains a lot of stuff. Information that helps us make sense of the world we live in. If you have anxiety its hard to move around in the house. There are large, looming boxes. It seems like in every room and in every corridor there is a box. It is hard to get to the stuff in all the rooms because the boxes are in the way. They block the windows and doors. And the worst part about these boxes is that they are impossible to remove. The boxes may be impossible to remove but they are not impossible to manage. When the house gets filled up its time to expand. As humans we have a limited about of brain power to think about stuff. This is called cognitive load theory. The more we have to worry about any any given time the worse we get at thinking. We run out of space because there are too many boxes. Anxiety keeps us from thinking straight. Move anxiety from out of your brain and into something else. Last year I began to journal. I filled pages with a stream of consciousness about how the world around me was closing in. The blank pages became my garage and I moved all the boxes in. I freed up space in my house. The act of writing became my process of cleaning the house. Giant boxes would appear in the rooms and journaling helped me move them into their space. The beauty of the external, mental garage is there is an infinite space to keep moving boxes in. The space doesn’t have to be journaling, sometimes it can be therapy, meditation, or the catharsis of a hobby. The idea is to be able to recognize when anxiety starts to bubble up and move it from your brain onto the page (or to another person, or a project). Acknowledgement of how you’re feeling is liberating. Setting aside space to experience anxiety comes with the space to manage it. You learn things about yourself and what sets you off. What seemed like impossible situations to live though before now become doable and with practice maybe even enjoyable. Getting started can be overwhelming. I mean, look at this image. A blank page can be absolutely terrifying. Here are a few tips to get started: These tips have been helpful for me. What are some other ways you manage anxiety?",2017
Platform Anxiety,"Or “How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Publish On Medium.” It began last spring with a bit of friendly advice from a buddy: “You should stop writing your blog.” Okay, maybe not the friendliest way to start, but he got my attention and meant well enough: “Not because what you write isn’t good, but because nobody will read it. Blogs are islands. They offer no exposure to unknown writers. You should try Medium.” With this post, I am finally taking his advice to heart, but that simple suggestion ended up costing me seven months of blogging. It triggered a technology-based creative block. This problem probably has a bunch of names already, but I am dubbing it “platform anxiety.” I’m also using a very generous definition of “platform” here; something encompassing both tools for production (pen and paper, word processors, typewriters), and distribution (social media channels, digital and traditional publishing). Platform anxiety is what happens when you are confronted with change after your tools have turned your creative groove into a rut. What results is a loop of justifications, procrastination, and creative stagnation, or paralysis. I suspect platform anxiety is particularly common among writers. Our skill set is fairly universal: words + page = writing. A common adage your hear is that there are no hard and fast rules in our trade. Now in theory, that means maximum versatility. We should be able to leverage any platform we want. In practice, we look to those platforms to provide structure in a potentially dizzying process. Then we cling to them like drowning men to driftwood. Being set in your ways is fine if you have already ‘made it.’ Hell, authors who refuse to compose on anything other than pen and paper or typewriters are often romanticized as heroes or geniuses. Sometimes that’s true. Usually they’re people who have transcended their anxieties through a combination of luck and talent. Younger writers do not have the luxury of hyper focusing on a platform. Locking yourself into a specific mode of creativity denies you opportunities in a highly competitive, over-saturated field. To give a little background, I am a professional narrative designer, an aspiring author, and an amateur entertainment critic. During the day, I write scripts, instructions, puzzle clues, slogans, form copy and everything in between. On my off hours, I work on novels. When I’m not doing those other things, I blog about nerd catnip: games, superhero movies, sci-fi television, anime, fantasy novels. There are thousands of people like me. Here’s the starter pack. I began blogging in a time when I believed I could be ‘discovered,’ find a following, and get picked up by Kotaku or somebody to carve out a career in ‘new journalism’ as an eventual segue into writing for the things I reviewed. It was a flawed dream for too many reasons to count; the millennial nerd equivalent of a small town actor heading to Hollywood with nothing but a lot of heart and big dreams. To begin with, personal blogs were already dinosaurs. By the time I figured that out, I had rationalized my habit as recreational writing. The prose equivalent of hitting the gym. And it does pay dividends! It’s a good way to get comfortable with your voice and to learn lessons from the things you consume (which, presumably reflect the kind of things you want to create). It also allows you to start discussions with whatever limited readership you have (most likely friends and family). But the truth is, for an aspiring author, having people actually read what you write in public is a Big Deal. It is still the goal, or it should be, unless you are actually writing a journal. Anything else you tell yourself is ultimately an excuse to spare your ego. It is an explanation for why you have not been magically discovered. When my friend recommended Medium, I acknowledged my predicament, but an excuse came to me automatically. “Sounds good,” I replied. “I’ll do some research and put my next piece on Medium.” Bull. Shit. Unless it explicitly benefits your writing, you aren’t actually researching. You are creating a project that doesn’t exist so you can justify putting off the real thing. Yes, you may have some questions, but here’s how you ‘research’ them: spend 10 minutes on Medium, write your piece, and hit the fucking publish button. Of all the excuses, why research? Because it can be easily rationalized. It couches reluctance in responsibility. I was being cautious. I was worried that a misstep would stain my (unknown) persona, or tarnish my (nonexistent) brand. If you find yourself following similar lines of thought, it’s time for another ego check: Aside from a few friends and family members, nobody cares. Worst case scenario, people keep on not caring. Best case scenario, you get some clicks. People read your name for the first time; maybe somebody follows you, or maybe they remember you the next time your piece pops up in their inbox/feed/whatever. The risk/reward ratio on this is a no-brainer. My personal expectations of my Medium debut steadily increased to compensate for my procrastination. I figured if it was something special, something that would outclass my earlier writing, the long wait would be justified. Again, that might be true if I had readers waiting for my next piece with bated breath. But it was really another justification for bad behavior. Towering expectations will estrange you from what you know how to do. I started an ambitious piece on Pokemon Go, a response to my former mentor’s assessment of the game, but before I could finish the article, the craze fizzled out and faded from relevance altogether. Something that used to come easily became a frightening chore. I can count the number of blog posts that have stuck with me on a single hand, and one of them is Evan Braun’s post, titled Don’t Hoard Your Silver Bullet. Distilled, the take away is “Don’t cling to your ideas because you are afraid of ‘wasting them’ or else they will never see the light of day.” It’s surprisingly hard advice to follow, because it’s natural to be precious with your ideas. But I try to take it to heart, and propose an addendum as well: Don’t save your bullets, and try different guns. This strains the metaphor a bit, but bear with me. Medium is just one option for distributing your content. Use it until you have spent all your rounds, then reload and try something else. Keep shooting until something hits. Because the alternative sucks! Sticking to your comfort zone won’t help you grow as a writer. The only thing worse than sticking to a losing formula is admitting change is necessary, and doing nothing about it. I kept doing my job, and making steady progress on my novel, but my process has suffered without blogging. I needed that third pole of creativity; something personal and public, lighthearted and reflective. The longer I waited, the harder the return became. As for how I finally got over the anxiety… well, you’re reading it. I’m not trying to argue that Medium is a panacea. I don’t expect it to find me an audience over night (but I bid new readers a warm, grateful welcome). You could substitute Medium with whatever new tool or technique you have been too neurotic, timid, or hidebound to try, and the point stands. When it comes to creativity, trying something new is almost always worth the shot. Don’t ‘research,’ don’t be ‘responsible,’ and don’t try to write the world’s best debut. Especially if you haven’t found your audience yet. When nobody is watching, you can try anything.",2017
Flying High in the Sky,"My Ongoing Battle with dealing with fear So my latest challenge is now a few days past and I am ready to talk about the challenges and the the successes of the experience. I have been thinking it through and trying to decide how I feel about it all. I will not lie. There were parts of the trip that were challenging. I knew what to expect from reading Flying with Confidence, but theory can only help you to a point. Experience is usually the final teacher when learning anything. So, the day of, I got to the airport at 9a. I had gotten the TSA Precheck, so was able to navigate security with very minimal stress. Once in the airport, I battled a low level of anxiety, but far less than I thought I might fight with. I boarded the plan with my co-workers, and the guy, our project manager, agreed to sit with me due to my anxiety about the flight. He was super! He really helped me through some key moments. How? He didn’t talk to me the entire time, but when he could tell I was struggling, he casually told me small stories and let me talk to him. He had his moments to be quiet, to read, to listen to his music and play a game he brought, but he watched out for me. I am extremely grateful for his kindness. He will not be traveling with me on my next flight, but the gals traveling with me will be, though there are four of us, and they sat together last time. We shall see how the seating goes. I may have to ask one of them to sit with me so I can have someone as a travel buddy. On the other hand, that might be something they are completely unwilling to do. I know most people don’t want to deal with another person’s anxiety about stuff. Regardless, I will be boarding the flight to go home for the weekend, and likewise, again returning to San Diego on the following Monday to go back to work. So, where am I at about my stress? Its still there. I am not going to lie. I think its going to be something I have to repeat the experience of multiple times to deal with it. I do know I really want to be free of the fear, so I have to keep trying. So, let me break down the mental and emotional responses. When the door closed, I didn’t know it because I couldn’t hear it or see it. I knew it was closed up because it was announced. Also the air went off temporarily as the engines did their work and we backed out from our bay in the airport. I was nervous, but keeping it together okay. I had the vent turned on me so that cool air was blowing on me to help me deal with the stress body heat. I did okay as the plane taxi’d into position to take off. I know that it has to go really fast to get into the air. The speed churns the air enough to give the wings of the plane the lift necessary. As we took off, my stomach dropped, but that is normal. It freaked me out a bit that we were traveling so high in the sky. I did eventually look out the window as we came in over the city of San Diego, and it was pretty cool looking, and it didn’t bother me to look out over the city at all. I actually enjoyed seeing the city below us. The turbulence bothered me, but it bothers a lot of people. It was really only mild to moderate turbulence, though San Diego was getting some rain so the turbulence was worse as we can in to land. Over all I actually did better than I would have ever done before without prepping for the trip. I did spend most of my trip listening to music to distract me, and wished I had some type of physical activity to bleed off the anxious feelings. My mind was battling with some fear, and worse, the expectation of being fearful. I didn’t expect immediate conquering of the fear, but I do believe I took an important step, and now I just need to persevere and not give up. I have three more flights ahead of me, so I will have more opportunities to practice. I look forward to a mind and heart freed from the anxious thoughts of a fear that has spent so much time consuming me and keeping me from enjoying life all over the world.",2017
on mental illnesses on the workplace,"i have so many undiagnosed mental illnesses i don't even know if i'm telling you all of them. depression is the biggest one, anxiety has been kicking in for about 3 years already, social anxiety is the real one at university… and i'm sure there's many more i still don't know the names to. and they're undiagnosed because i don't have the money to pay for a consistent therapist or psychologist or psychiatrist. or even the money to pay for the medicine i know i'll have to take. for me to have money to continue to pay for my education and maybe spend on a therapist, i need a job. and that's where the fun stuff happen. in job interviews, they want people who are charismatic, who are communicative, who puts tons of efforts into what they're doing, who are loud and active and who want things. and i'm not one of those people. i freeze when i talk, i don't like to be around other people, i'm too introverted for my own sake, i work hard but sometimes that's not enough. and i'm so tired of trying so hard to put on this persona every time i step into an interview room, put this mask on that i'm very good at everything including being a normal human being, but it always comes down once i have to introduce myself. today, for the first time in my 2 year job seeking journey, i talked about my anxiety in an interview. the question was: ""talk about a situation where you had to overcome yourself to help someone else."" and i talked about that single episode in my second semester of university. during theology class on the vision of the 3 main monotheist religions on suicide, euthanasia and hunger strikes, my teacher played a video. of people committing suicide. i didn't watch it but i had to comfort so many of my friends who were absolutely devastated after it. i still have that image stuck into my brain of my friend on the floor weeping into a psychologist's lap. it's strongly stuck to my memory because that's when i realized we're more similar than we know. and i talked about that moment, when i had to suck it up, to dry my own tears, to push to the back of my mind the several — and i mean Several — times i tried to kill myself, because there were others in conditions worse than mine. and it was the last question of the interview. and after that she said: ""we're done. you went really well."" and gave a tiny laugh. as i answered the question, i didn't think talking about my anxiety and my depression would have an effect on this interview. i was too focused on reliving that horrible moment in my brain. so when i stopped talking, it came to me in a huge wave that ""shit, they don't like depressed people in the workplace."" and once she said i went really well, despite having just said about my mental illnesses, i got a boost of self confidence i've been lacking in the past 2 years. maybe my anxiety and depression won't always get the best of me. they're part of me and maybe some employees aren't in the 19th century and they can understand that it's a part of me just like my organization, my creativity, my effort and my will. some employees understand that having mental illnesses is a part of human nature and it may affect my job, but so it does with everyone. it's just a maybe. i might get rejected after this interview and i might lose my spot to a white 25 year old guy who studied engineering — like i always do. but at least i know that it makes no sense in hiding out these crucial aspects of myself in job interviews to play the part. i'm ill. and that's a part of me.",2017
How to Meditate Every Day,"“Meditation is not about feeling a certain way. It’s about feeling the way you feel.” -Dan Harris (10% Happier) In 2016, I meditated every day. It wasn’t easy. I planned to meditate for months before I first tried it, and it took me years to develop a daily practice. Trapped in a cycle of busyness, I never had enough time. I didn’t understand that 5 minutes a day could transform my day and change my life. My never-ending stress and anxiety were caused by my thoughts and not by others’ actions. My need for numbing through TV and phone games were just cries from my mind for rest. My introduction to meditation was practically forced on me after a stress-related injury to my spine. After months of mixed results from various treatments, meditation became the most beneficial therapy. The cure wasn’t from meditation itself, but from the change in my mindset developed from daily meditation. I’m not a meditation expert, but through the years, I have established a practice that sticks. There is no simple hack. I believe that you must commit to a daily practice and push through the days when it’s the last thing you want to do. Over time, you’ll start to notice the subtle benefits. Below are some techniques and strategies that helped: When I started meditating, I set the timer on my phone for two minutes. I didn’t focus on breathing. I didn’t sit in a meditation posture. I sat on the couch and tried to do nothing. It was hard, and sometimes it’s still hard. It’s difficult because most of us don’t know how to sit still for any amount of time. We are constantly in a state of doing. We turn on the TV. We open the mail. We think about our schedules. We browse Instagram or Twitter. Get used to having a bit of space in your day, starting with just two minutes a day. You can also try Do Nothing for 2 Minutes, a simple website with a two-minute timer that will reset if you move your cursor. Shifting my thoughts from grandiose goals to daily habits transformed my practice. Initially, I committed to long sessions, but I couldn’t make a daily practice stick. It always felt like too much time, and once I failed to meet my goals, I stopped meditating completely. “Make haste slowly. Make your effort consistent and steady. Give yourself time to incorporate the meditation practice into your life, and let your practice grow gradually and gently.” –Henepola Gunaratana, Mindfulness in Plain English Meditation is a lot like running. When you start, you build distance and time gradually. You may not notice the benefits right away and if you push too hard, you are more likely to give up. And if you haven’t ran in a while, it’s hard to put your running shoes on. But gradually, it becomes easier. Eventually, it feels like something is missing if you skip a run. You wouldn’t go for 20 miles on your first run, so you shouldn’t try to meditate for an hour during your first session. Start small and grow your meditation practice slowly. Start with 2 minutes per day once a day. I like to meditate in the mornings and evenings, and I prefer to have two sessions per day even if it’s for shorter periods of time. I have coffee and read before my morning meditation, but you may want to meditate as soon as you get out of bed. Maybe, meditation at night works better for you. Based on your schedule and routines, you’ll need to figure out the when and the how long of your meditation practice. I recommend that you meditate daily. It’s better to have short sessions once a day than a longer one once per week. An example meditation “training” schedule: Week 1: 2 minutes per day Week 2: 5 minutes per day once per day Week 3: 5 minutes twice per day Week 4: 7 minutes twice per day Week 5: 10 minutes twice per day Week 6: 15 minutes twice per day Keep in mind that there is no set regimen for growing your meditation practice. You may need to meditate for two minutes a day for months, but when it starts to feel easy, try adding short increments of time. Start slowly, so you don’t give up. Take time to get used to sitting for long periods. Give yourself time to accept the resistance that will arise in your mind. A system based on rewards is helpful. For example, if I meet my meditation goals for the week, I reward myself. My reward could be a massage, a nice dinner, or a movie. Your reward should be whatever best incentivizes you. Insight Timer is a meditation app that includes a feature-rich meditation timer and many guided meditations. But it also has gamification, and this feature has been the heart of my meditation practice. I hit 365 consecutive days last month, but once I made it to 10 days, I didn’t want the days to reset. Now, even on the days when I have a hundred excuses to skip meditation, I won’t. The incentive to not go back to Day 1 always overshadows every excuse. You can also try Headspace or Calm. I learned how to meditate from Tara Brach’s guided meditations. She has dozens, if not hundreds, available through her website, podcast, and Insight Timer. They’re great for beginners but also helpful for seasoned meditators who want some guidance in their practice. On days when I feel anxious or distracted, I listen to Tara’s meditations, which range from a few minutes to over 30 minutes. My favorites are: Gateway to Presence (10:30) Loving This Life — Happiness (Metta Meditation) (16:30) Vipassana (Mindfulness or Insight) — (19:43) A Listening Presence (28:58) You can also try Thich Nhat Hanh, Joseph Goldstein, Sam Harris or Headspace. On Sundays, I like to meditate for a long time. “Long” is different for everyone. It may be 5 minutes, 30 minutes, 1 hour, or more. It’s helpful to find a meditation group or a friend to meditate with for these long sessions. Without the accountability, you might find it difficult to resist the desire to “finish” early. Below are several books that taught me the benefits of mindfulness and meditation. If you don’t know where to start, read Mindfulness in Plain English by Henepola Gunaratana. Mindfulness in Plain English by Henepola Gunaratana Waking Up: A Guide to Spirituality Without Religion by Sam Harris 10% Happier by Dan Harris The Miracle of Mindfulness: An Introduction to the Practice of Meditation by Thich Nhat Hanh The Mindful Way through Depression by Mark Williams, John D. Teasdale, Zindel V. Segal, Jon Kabat-Zinn I have practiced yoga off and on for almost a decade, but meditation taught me what yoga really is. Yoga is a form of moving meditation. The physical benefits are secondary to the mental ones. Mark Whitwell reminded me of this when we met at a yoga retreat. Mark’s Promise Yoga Practice is a very simple series of movements that are synchronized with the breath. I find that focused inhales and exhales with movements make it easier to clear my mind. On my best days, I combine a short 10 minute Promise Yoga practice with 15 to 30 minutes of sitting meditation in the morning. There’s not a better way to start my day. The practice can be as short as 5 minutes or as long as you need it to be based on the number of repetitions per asana (movement). You can transform any yoga practice by bringing it back to the breath. For example, you are probably familiar with the cat and cow yoga poses. You should move into cow while you inhale and into cat as you exhale. You can concentrate on synchronizing your movement with your breath, initiating the exhale as you start the movement and completing the exhale as you finish it. If you attend a yoga class and the teacher doesn’t tell you when you inhale or exhale, ask. To learn more you can buy Mark’s book, The Promise, or download his Promise Yoga app for iOS. Mark’s practiced is based on the teachings of T. Krishnamacharya and his son TKV Desikachar. To get deeper, buy The Heart of Yoga: Developing a Personal Practice by T. K. V. Desikachar Most of us walk, drive, and work out while reading, listening to music or podcasts, or talking on the phone. Try skipping the music on your next run. Don’t talk on the phone or listen to an audiobook on your next drive. Take in the present and focus on your breath as you walk, drive, commute, etc. If you think you don’t have the time to meditate, this is the time for you. Kinhin is the formal walking meditation practiced in zazen, but something a bit more natural might be better for your commute or for the 10 minutes of cool down at the end of your run. Learn more about Jon Kabat-Zinn’s walking meditation at Berkeley’s Greater Good Science Center. Obviously, you shouldn’t meditate when you drive, but here are some mindfulness tips for your next drive. Often when I’ve been moving too quickly, I notice a feeling in my chest. It’s similar to the anxiety you feel in the pit of your stomach before addressing a crowd or that feeling you get before a first date. In these moments, I find a place where I can get a few minutes to myself. Usually, it’s the bathroom. I sit on the toilet (with the lid closed), take 10 to 20 long inhales and exhales, and the feeling passes. If all else fails, one way to develop a habit is to immerse yourself. You can force the discipline by taking everything else away. If you have the time, consider attending a 10 day Vipassana retreat. There are centers all over the world, and it is one of the best ways to introduce yourself to a meditation practice. For 10 days, you meditate for 8+ hours every day without access to a phone, books, writing materials, or speaking. You cut off your interaction with the outside world. And with it to can look into yourself and “open the knots tied by the old habit of reacting in an unbalanced way to pleasant and unpleasant situations.” And best of all, the retreats are free, and run solely on donations. The benefits from meditation are very subtle. You may not see them from day-to-day, but over time, you’ll begin to notice the differences in yourself. For me, the most obvious difference was that the pain from my chronic injury went away. Now, it is connected to my practice. The pain returns if I stop meditating for a few days. If you’re interested in learning more, there are many studies and articles on the benefits of mindfulness meditation for chronic pain. A proper sitting posture is good for your back and shoulders. Notice your body the next time you’re in a tense situation. You’ll see that your back is tight and that your shoulders and neck are tense. You’ll feel the tension in the corners of your mouth and eyes. Your jaw will be rigid. If you carry your body this way for long periods of time, it will lead to chronic back, neck, and shoulder pain. Meditation helps you recognize the differences between tension and relaxation in your body. It helps you become more aware of the connection between your body and mind. You’ll also begin to see. Before meditation, my day was filled with doing instead of seeing. Now, I notice that the movements of sandpipers resemble yoga poses. I see the way squirrels never tire of burying and unburying the same acorn in the same spot. I notice the intricate details of spiders bodies and the luxuriousness of flowers on any day in any place. I see a countless number of things that I used to ignore, and now I recognize how blind I was due to the busyness of my mind. Most importantly, your emotional response to everything will change: You’ll see the difference between the things that are in and out of your control. You’ll replace reacting with responding. You’ll be more mindful and present. You’ll learn gratefulness. You’ll see the beauty in almost every situation. You’ll develop clarity in your actions and thoughts. Your productivity will increase. You’ll become a better problem solver. You’ll see the difference between negative thoughts and self-deprecating ones. You’ll sleep better. You’ll stop numbing parts of your life, so you’ll be able to feel everything completely. You’ll stop thinking in terms of “if only.” You’ll stop living your life with fear and constraint. You’ll never be “busy” again. You’ll no longer have to cling to the good things that won’t last and live in fear of the things that could happen. Researching the many types of meditation is overwhelming, but remember that there is no “right” way to meditate. Vipassana (insight) meditation resonated most with me, but you may find that mantra based meditation, kundalini, or zazen works best for you. Do your two minutes of nothing. Explore different types of meditation. Try some classes, either online or in person. Most importantly, commit to a daily meditation practice. Stick with it when you think it’s a waste of time. Continue even if you think it isn’t helping. Commit to it for at least 30 days. But focus on today, one day at a time. “Our minds are all we have. They are all we have ever had. And they are all we can offer others. This might not be obvious, especially when there are aspects of your life that seem in need of improvement — when your goals are unrealized, or you are struggling to find a career, or you have relationships that need repairing. But it’s the truth. Every experience you have ever had has been shaped by your mind. Every relationship is as good or as bad as it is because of the minds involved. If you are perpetually angry, depressed, confused, and unloving, or your attention is elsewhere, it won’t matter how successful you become or who is in your life — you won’t enjoy any of it.”- Sam Harris (Waking Up: A Guide to Spirituality Without Religion) Originally posted at The Imperfectionist",2017
Uncommon Anxiety Cures: When “Desire” Becomes a “Need”,"If you woke up this morning with a fever you understand that fever is only the symptom of another problem. The fever is a warning that some bug is has invaded your body. The same thing is true for anxiety. Anxiety is the symptom of a healthy behavior that has become unhealthy. The desire to prove you can complete a task is healthy behavior. Tens-of-millions of people around the world have the desire to prove their success just like you. All that’s required is having a challenging issue, developing a goal to solve the issue, and the energy to make it happen. Once you successfully meet the goal you have the feeling of accomplishment. That, however, is not what happens when the “Desire” to prove yourself becomes the “Need” to prove yourself. The issue can be the same but that’s the only similarity. The driving force in the “Need” to prove is anxiety. What if I fail? What if I embarrass myself? What if I look foolish?” All of these questions produce anxiety. If the goal is achieved there is not the good feeling of accomplishment, but the feeling of it’s “never enough.” If you are driven by the need to prove sooner or later the anxiety is going to be overwhelming. I worked with a leader in the mid-west who was experiencing overwhelming anxiety. No day was a good day for him. The anxiety became so overwhelming he literally thought he was going to die. He had purchased the company from a relative and felt the pressure to keep it successful. When I first told him that his problem wasn’t anxiety but his behavior he didn’t believe me. All he wanted was the anxiety “fixed.” He finally realized how much pressure he was placing on himself over the seven years he owned the company. He finally came to realize that no matter how hard he tried, no matter how many successes, or how much money he made he was never going to prove himself. Another significant realization was that no one wanted him to prove he could be successful. The pressure all came from within himself. The uncommon cure for anxiety has four parts: Be aware that anxiety is not the problem, a behavior is the problem. Change the behavior and the anxiety goes away. Develop a personal purpose statement that includes your gift, how you want to treat employees and what you want customers to experience. Create 3 or 4 affirmations that define your success, for example, “I am a caring leader who…” If you have been prescribed medication, ask your doctor how to slowly decrease the dosage. When you feel anxiety coming on replace the feeling with one or all of your positive affirmations. Once again, anxiety is always a healthy behavior that you are doing to an extreme. Create your own pathway and goals. Don’t be driven by what others think or tell you. Expert Reaction:“Very helpful post especially for me as an Empath.

Adulting with a Mental Illness(es) (possible TW),"Trying to be a good adult is hard for anyone. Trying to adult with mental illnesses is damn near impossible. For me, it’s literally all I can do to keep myself alive, add on trying to work, pay bills and be responsible, it’s horrifying. I’ve missed my last 2 shifts because I was too depressed and kept having overwhelming panic attacks. Last night, I felt like I wanted to drink or cut. So I decided that since I had missed work, I needed a meeting. My dad, being the ass that he can be, said “Well, you’re just not able to go to work, but you can go to a meeting?” I cannot begin to tell you how much this pissed me off. (This was following his, “Why can’t you just make yourself go to work?”, comment) I love having money and being able to support myself, so don’t you think if I COULD, I WOULD?! I appreciate all my parents having done for me. I moved back in with them in November, following 2 back-to-back psychiatric hospital stays. They told me that since I wasn’t able to work, they could help me financially….however, the catch was that I moved back in with them. (I had moved out 3 years prior, because I could no longer handle the constant fighting). Now I’m here, I’m feeling immense pressure to save and save fast. I’m isolating again. I could literally overdose and be dead before anyone even came near my room or thought to check on me. And that’s a scary, sad fucking thought. I feel like a burden. I feel so alone. I can’t do anything right. The self harming behaviors have dramatically increased. The other night, I sat on the floor covered in blood…wondering how I let it get this bad. I’ve done everything I’m supposed to do. I go to therapy 2–3 times a week. I see my psychiatrist monthly. I take my medications every morning and every night. I’m going to meetings. I’m asking for help. I’m trying to work. I’m writing down things when I feel badly. I’m painting as a healthy coping mechanism. I DON’T KNOW WHAT ELSE TO DO! My therapist said that she was right about thinking that my going back to work would be a bad idea. That she felt I needed long term residential treatment. I told my mom…and her reply was that if I couldn’t hold a job, maybe they should put me in a long term facility. And get rid of my car. So, I’d go to somewhere I’m totally un-fucking-familiar with. I wouldn’t be seeing my therapist (she’d probably fill my slot for when I did get out, she wouldn’t be the first.) I’d miss my sponsor (even though she irritates me at times), the people at my meetings. I’d get out of the facility, with no job. No car. No savings. No hope. With no car, means I’m trapped here indefinitely…till I get a job (which I need a car for) and save up some cash. I’d also miss my trip in March. So basically, my adulting skills fucking suck. I’m really at a loss for what to do. Everything seems to be falling apart faster than I know how to handle.",2017
How to Stop Stress and Anxiety:,"Do you suffer from anxiety and stress while sleeping, working or driving? Here are Top 9 Ways to Stop Stress and Anxiety: Caffeine is similar to nicotine because you can also experience withdrawal symptoms after going cold turkey. If you stop drinking caffeine completely, you may experience headaches, tiredness, constipation, or even depression. Getting enough sleep isn’t only about total hours of sleep. It’s also important to get good quality sleep on a regular schedule so you feel rested when you wake up. If you Need an emotional lift Or need to blow off some steam after a stressful day? A gym session or brisk 30-minute walk can help. Physical activity stimulates various brain chemicals that may leave you feeling happier and more relaxed. “I never think of the future. It comes soon enough.” -Albert Einstein The answer is simple, though not always so easy to put into practice: learn to be present. No matter how out-of-control your day is, no matter how stressful your job or life becomes, the act of being present can become an oasis. It can change your life, and it’s incredibly simple. When you are over committed and under too much stress, you are more likely to feel run-down and possibly get sick when you say no, you open the door for others to step up. Or you can delegate someone to take over the task. They may not do things the way you would, but that’s OK. They’ll find their own way. Yes! Science has shown that your mind and body benefits from taking time out of your daily life to shut down and meditate. The benefits of meditation are endless, but mantras for anxiety or sinking into deep relaxation with yoga Nidra will help you feel centered. Your body will thank you! “Your work is going to fill a large part of your life, and the only way to be truly satisfied is to do what you believe is great work. And the only way to do great work is to love what you do.” — Steve Jobs In a Simple word of him do things you love the most like it should be your passion. Here are few benefits of laughter.

Shy Infants May Develop Anxiety as Adults — Study,"Being extremely shy or getting fidgety over mingling with people is often considered a personality problem. Shyness can be noticed not only in adults but even in infants and children. According to an ongoing study by researchers from the Penn University, infants who are overly shy and petrified of newer things may be susceptible to developing anxiety problems later in life. The study, funded by the NIMH (National Institute of Mental Health), aims to unearth further information in this area to help such children. Previous studies have found that extremely shy children might develop anxiety as they grow up. However, no comprehensive and detailed assessment have been done regarding the relationship between the two. The researchers wanted to gauge the behavioral inhibition of their respondents, which is a normal tendency to recoil from unfamiliar environments, people and situations. All these could cause anxiety problems during adulthood, especially social anxiety, said Pérez-Edgar, one of the three principal investigators of the multi-site project. The researchers want to learn about kids’ behavior in their social environment and their outlook towards the world. During the initial two years of this long-term study, the researchers would look into different attention patterns in infants that are governed by various factors like biology, environment and parental behaviors. A unique feature would be that the experiment would continue in three different sites more or less concurrently. “It will be interesting to see the commonalities and differences in what the infants are exposed to and their reactions,” said Pérez-Edgar of the three testing sites. Research to identifying triggers of anxiety to help children battle them With the help of several testing methods, the researchers want to look into parameters like parental anxiety due to threats in their ward’s environment, psychosocial stressors of the child as well as symptoms. Ranging from a static eye tracking equipment to a children’s video to detect happy, neutral or sad faces and a slew of toys, the researchers are taking help from a handful of equipment. Even puppet shows are planned to help in the research. The researchers intend to collect the data from two sources, an electroencephalogram meant for tracking the brain’s electrical activity and the other from an electrocardiograph, which records the electrical activity of the heart. Parents would have to complete questionnaires, which will be a measure of their characteristics, environmental stress levels at home, as well as an assessment of their child’s behavior. Edgar further said that by identifying the stressors in the child, his or her attention can be amply diverted and the child can be trained not to run after things which may cause him/her anxiety and instead focus on something more rewarding. The researchers are confident that the results would reveal a lot about the child, including the early emergence of behavioral inhibition, as well as how the structure of the brain and behavior influence each other. This, in turn, would enable them to help such children grow up to be well-adjusted and happy individuals. Dealing with anxiety Anxiety and stress can drive children into a cocoon of their own. Shy or timid children are plagued with constant anxiety from within. They need consistent reassurance to come out of the shadow of inner anxiety or stress. For the more severe conditions, treatment becomes inevitable. The same goes for adults as well. Major anxiety disorder problems can only be managed with the help of an expert.

Words have Meaning,"That word was acceptable when we called people with epilepsy possessed or people with leprosy cursed. Sadly, in the 21st century people with mental illnesses are still called Mad and Mental. I have never heard anyone be abused as a diabetic and we will not wish cancer on our worst enemy…but we still say “are you mad?” This is no one’s fault…it is what we have always said…it is entertaining when we see people running around naked or talking to themselves…hey I am as guilty as the next person- and I am bipolar. And in all honesty the things I did when I was in my mania were “mad”: These are just a few of my war stories and the way I tell it would have you choking because you get to people with humour. But words have meanings. When you say someone is mad, crazy, a lunatic etc. you are degrading a sick person. You are insulting someone through no fault of their own is in a state that is different from the normal. Even depression which everyone sees as a weakness (I get so ticked off when someone says just look yourself in the mirror and talk to yourself or your being lazy or suck it up) is actually a proven illness. SPECT brain scans can show the difference in level of activity in the brain between healthy (don’t even like when they say normal because I am normal I am just sick) and unhealthy brains. I think it would be better if we could remove the word mental and just say illness. Because that is really what it is; an illness. But because it is a mental issue I can understand the medical distinction…I just wish you understood that yes my head is not correct but hey it could have been my heart, kidneys or lungs.

Expert Tips For Staying on Track After The Holiday Season,"The holiday season like Christmas and New Year is that part of the year for which everyone waits with bated breath. During this time, there is bonhomie in the air and people love to shop, eat, drink and make merry. However, it is also a challenge not to get swayed by the many lures of boozing, smoking and partying. Overdosing on weeds or other substances often becomes the norm during this time. People also consume alcohol beyond their limits and end up feeling giddy or running into other troubles. Eating unhealthy is also followed by guilt pangs. Amid all these, there is a chance of people getting hooked on to alcohol or other substances which they try for fun during the holiday season. Hence, one should take certain precautions not to get trapped in all these vices and to continue with the earlier healthy habits. Experts have many pieces of advice to offer which may help people from being swerved towards getting hooked to addictive substances and suffer from stress and anxiety thereafter. Here, we discuss some of the ways experts suggest to stay on track after a holiday: • Having goals: Setting goals to stay fit can work wonders for those who tend to get heavily influenced by the atmosphere. A pre-set dietary plan can thwart temptations to gorge on food, wine and other indulgences. This will help people muster required willpower to make choices which are aligned to the goals. • Recipe makeovers: Overhauling the usual holiday recipe or the ones immediately after the festive season can be a good idea to escape the guilt or anxiety of overeating and putting on that extra bulge. It would not only ensure that one eats healthy but will also protect one from going through any anxiety of having overeaten and overindulged. • Measures to control portions: Eating a piece of pie or cake during the holiday season is usually unavoidable. But one can cut on that by choosing smaller spoons or ladles to serve delicacies. With a smaller spoon, there will be less portion on the plate every time one helps himself or herself to more food. • Practicing mindful eating: This is a very good practice if one wants to cut down on eating too much. It involves slowing down and paying attention to the act of eating. When one savors each bite, the food intake gets reduced and one takes a voluntary break from eating extra. • Stepping outside: Stepping outside the house or arranging a family get-together, be it over a football match or for that matter any such outdoorsy activity, will help curb the tendency to overeat. • Swap a shopping trip with a workout session: Instead of going on shopping and splurging, it is better to go for a workout and burn those calories. All the remorse of spending hefty amount during a shopping spree can be replaced with feelings of doing a noble activity like a workout. It is a win-win situation; on the one hand, it will save money while on the other it will benefit one’s health. Besides, it will also prevent any feelings of anxiety from breeding. Dealing with anxiety disorders Anxiety disorder is a common mental disorder, with more and more people falling prey to it due to various reasons. Stress and anxiousness are part of life and there is no escape from them. But severe and chronic anxiety qualifies for treatment.

This Is 10X Better Than A New Year’s Resolution,"Get ready: the New Year has approached. This is the season of annoying Facebook posts about joining clean eating challenges, 6 AM running clubs or the money-making millionaires group. While there is absolutely nothing wrong with joining these groups to give yourself something to work towards, I don’t like the mindset of it being a resolution. Having a New Year’s resolution means having 12 months to make a change. There isn’t much structure within that, and I also believe that New Year’s resolutions put down the year before as if there was something wrong that you did and you were too far on a negative path. I don’t think that way. Everything that happens, happens for a reason. You weren’t running every single morning because you had other priorities, so please do not forget to give credit where credit is due. You did your absolute hardest to eat well, move your body daily, be there for your family, keep up with your health, work and accomplish all the other things required of you on a day to day basis. And if you don’t feel that way? Well, that’s okay too. You did what you felt you needed to do. With the New Year approaching, I want to let you in on how I go about setting (and accomplishing) my goals. I will tell you this, truthfully: I have never accomplished a New Year’s resolution. Without structure, drive and simplicity, I could never achieve whatever my over-arching goal was. On the other hand, by creating a system that I revisit every 3 months, I’ve been able to accomplish huge feats such as doubling my income, shifting my mindset, manifesting the type of relationship I desire, making more girlfriends, getting plugged into my local community, eating in a way that works for me, and so much more. Here’s a way to go about New Years goals that I swear will lead to results 10X better than the typical “resolution” route. WATCH: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZZJqRkRwNnE So, are you ready to make shift happen? Tony Robbins says “complexity is the death of productivity” and I’ve found nothing to be closer to the truth. My system is simple. Easy? Maybe not. But simple, definitely. Break up your goals into 3’s that you want to see come to fruition every 3 months. I give myself 3 goals that I want to accomplish within the first 3 months of the year. The goals range from being spiritual, emotional, relational, personal, physical and financial. So for January to March, I will pick three simple goals I want to see happen. For example, let’s say I want to make $7,000 each month (financial) , travel out of the country once (personal) and have a more consistent spiritual practice (spiritual). These 3 goals are great because they are practical, achievable and immediate. I can begin working on them now, and I know I have a timeline to accomplish them: three months. From there, I break them down even further, like so: Make $7,000 each month Travel out of the country Spiritual practice And that’s the gist of it! I will write down these goals (and subgoals) on a piece of paper and hang it up somewhere I can read every morning. I will set my passwords to reflect these goals, I’ll create vision boards, I will talk about my goals “as if” they are already coming to life, and I will take time to feel grateful for all the wonderful works happening. I will revisit these at the end of 3 months, let go of what didn’t serve me, continue to push myself in the directions that do, and create new goals that might be more applicable to where I am in life at that time. I do this 4 times throughout the year, and I can tell you that this simplified process of goal-setting is ten times better than any over-arching, vague resolution could ever be. Give it a shot, and let me know below what your first three goals are going to be! This post was originally on maddymoon.com.",2017
Possessed By My Possessions,"So, the party is over. The holidays are done. Now what? Ahh yes! the cold January blues have just about to set in. The holiday buzz is gone, the weather is less than ideal and the bills from the past are coming due. Realizing your mindset right now and reacting appropriately will set the stage on your happiness for the the rest of the winter and year. So for the next few weeks, I shall be on high alert not to allow myself to slip into the winter blues. Identifying what makes me anxious now is key to avoiding the sadness. Over the holiday break I had a chance to reflect about what really makes me happy. As I was putting together my New Year’s resolutions, I pondered on the events that will lead me to a fulfilling life. What do I need to accomplish to lead me where I want to go? After much debate, I wrote them down and published them for added accountability. Problem is, I omitted a resolution! When I ask myself what makes me happy, what I should be asking myself: What makes me sad? In fear of pushing my family and myself too much, I avoided committing myself to something that I know deep down, must be changed. My wife knows when I am stressed or anxious about something. I have a tendency to pick our house apart and feel the need to clean every square inch of it. It has taken some time, but she knows to just stay out of my way and let me clean until I get whatever it is out of my head. Over the years I have noticed that I get into these moods when I feel most anxious about our financial situation. Deep anxiety is something that I have battled with for a long time. Only recently have I identified the triggers and effective coping mechanisms. Making my wife and son irritated by my excessive need to clean the house is not an appropriate coping mechanism. While, we end up with a clean house after my anxiety filled shit-storm, I end up making those around me miserable in the process. But what is it that makes me the most anxious and sad? My things! It has been said that the things you own will eventually end up owning you. As I grow older, the more I look at the stuff that surrounds me, the more I begin to resent them. My wisdom has allowed me to appreciate experiences over collecting stuff. I have learned to appreciate relationships more than personal wealth. For years I believed that owning a house, a car and collecting sports memorabilia was the only life I ever wanted. Then something changed, I now wan’t to live with less and experience more. When I die, the only thing that I will leave behind are the created memories and not the things that I had accumulated. Last spring I hastily sold my Mustang and didn’t even shed a tear when it drove away. I was so relieved to be free from the anxious energy I spent on that car. Sure, it was “fun” to have, but I became obsessed with cleaning and fussing with it that I eventually I grew to resent it. Selling it was an instant relief. The car no longer owned me. Now I am turning my sights on the house that we “own”. It has become too much for what we really need. Is it time to take the big step to downsizing now? I have learned that my anxiety fueled house cleaning is my brain’s way to appease my possessions. By keeping them clean, I somehow manage to regain control over my house and the things within it and my stress eases temporarily. I have dreams of owning a tiny condo with little or no maintenance. I dream of travelling the world on a whim and not worrying about the pressures of interest leaches picking away at our bank account. I dream of experiencing life instead of owning any of the stuff in it. I dream where money doesn’t have to matter to our family; not by winning the lottery or by getting that big promotion, but by living within the most basic of our needs. I dream that my family can actually experience whatever it is that we want to experience. I dream that someday my son will be able to dream too and that his stuff won’t possess him. I think I may have omitted the biggest New Year’s resolution of them all to my happiness. In 2017, it is time to make less become more.",2017
The Pendulum,"Supper (with spaghetti on the menu) tastes unusually good, and you go on a texting spree to the ones who still manage to love you, flawed and confused you…..because Life is too short to be difficult for no reason, to find home in dark mental rooms, to make yourself impervious to love. You don’t know how long you will be around, or how much you even want to be around, but you’d like to think that you want to pass the time gulping all the little droplets of affection around you, absorbing all the individual doses of humanity, giving as much love as your infamously slippery heart can afford, dispensing with that mental sieve which tries to distinguish admiration from curiosity, just stopping short of a rare ‘Daddy I love you’ message. Mum is too far away in Dreamville to hear her phone beep, else you’d have loved to hear your baby sister attempt to sing in the first few words her 31-month-old tongue can afford….. And night suddenly gives way to morning. The weekend goes through some mathematics, getting cancelled out by three alphabets, and what you have is a new week, with the attendant reluctance of your toes to touch the ground, the shivers that will run through four other mornings, your shackles disguised as work shoes and your chain in form of a neck tie beckoning gleefully. A grudging bath is followed by a scuffle between your skin and an office shirt, but it’s the economy and slaves must head to their plantations, so you clutch the door knob and step out…… To a morning which has got your bag feeling six times lighter than your chest. You cant place where the weight is coming from, but you begin to feel that Xanax and other anxiety pills wont be such a bad idea, and it all comes pouring in from there…..the plantation routine, phone numbers which have become mere digits with no emotions attached, the image of standing alone at a bus stop and feeling that your life could play out in similar fashion, memories of unachieved goals, procastinations, faded crushes forced to wilt by your shut-outs, fear of stagnation, daytime nightmares of the also-ran phenomenon. The previous evening’s rainbow has become a pitch black cloud, the commercial break has timed out, and you make a return to regular programming, where the only smiles are false ones….. But how dare you? How dare you try to be happy? What were you thinking, that the shadows would just disappear? This is you, this is your existence, where days try to outdo themselves in a “which of us is darker? “ game show, and nights swear to strip you of any sort of warmth. The short periods of giggling have elapsed, and no number of Zikoko threads will bring back the thrill. You knew it was too good to be true when the smiles didn’t go away, you were anxious that you were being too happy, and true to expectation, the bliss didn’t last. The friends you reached out to a few hours before are excitedly typing away responses, wondering what came over you to have occasioned such warmth…..but the thick cloak is back over you, and once again you wont respond, unable to process your thoughts properly, and you almost want to address one with the words “sorry for the text, wrong mood.” You anticipate everything; butt cheek french-kissing, office mails reminding you of your expendability and inadequacy, the increasing gulf between you and the colleagues who gossip in the city’s popular dialect, and you call on a Being in whom your belief alternates by the hour, not asking for much, not even for happiness, just enough mental strength to see out the day…..and you feel heavier instead of effecting a trade of yokes and burdens, but you’ve got to cut him some slack; it’s hard tending to you and 6,999,999,999 others, never mind the rhetoric of cheap sparrows and counted hairs. The blues are here, the blues will stay, the blues are you. Contributing Writer Mentally Aware Nigeria Initiative Originally published at Mentally Aware Nigeria Initiative.",2017
The Only Confused 20 Something,"What the fucking fuck am I doing?? I graduated from a cool Liberal Arts school with a 3.8 GPA. I studied Political Science and Feminist & Gender Studies, because I give a crap about understanding my surroundings and how my understanding differs from others. Well, that, and like 100 other things. I mean, look at the race of every author you ever read in college. Chances are 70–90% of them are white. Look at the gender. The class. You know what I’m saying. Now, look at the identities of the voices you CLOSE read in any Gender Studies, Women’s Studies, Feminist Studies, Queer Studies, Critical Studies–Whatever your department spent months of arguing and voting on to call it. It was fucking diverse, if your college had a diverse staff of academics who know what “intersectionality” is. Damn, that rant felt good. I should rant more. Ok, so this blog is gonna be the place I shit out all my thoughts. Because right now I’m experiencing extreme anxiety that I am a failure, I am not perfect, I’ve made too many mistakes, I haven’t done enough, I’m in over my head, my boobs are too big and I AM TIRED OF IT. I’m tired of trying to be pretty, do pretty things, produce pretty work. I’m done. Okay, rewind. Before I graduated in 2015, I studied the above. I also took a bunch of film classes, one taking me to Los Angeles to see if a career in Entertainment was for me and another enrolling me in Sundance’s “Ignite” program to reinforce the artistic value of storytelling. By the way, when someone in a recent work place of mine found out I spent time at Sundance she immediately responded “what were YOU doing at Sundance?” Wow. Thanks for the vote of confidence. More on that kind of shit later. So I did the film stuff, blah blah blah. Started a comedy troupe. Did stand up. Wrote pilots. A professor told me I had the talent and voice of a TV Writer. So I gave up on pretending I wanted to be a lawyer and gave into the secret dream of being Tina Fey. And it’s all I talked about. All I freaking talked about was comedy, comedy writing, comedy writers, television, television writers and how I want to do what they freaking did for me. Which was keep me on my ass for half of high school, instead of out in the world. But god damn, I was happy. The characters on TV were my friends. It’s sad, but true. WHATEVER. I was popular during freshmen and sophomore year to the point people made me their profile pics on fb. I was lonely, but my first two years made up for it. And the loneliness was an incredible break from the crippling social anxiety of needing to remain useful to your peers, trust me. How did this blog post about where I’m at now end up where I was almost a decade ago? Back to the point. I’m 24. I’m in Los Angeles. Moved here as soon as I could after graduating. Moved into a shitty apartment–bed bugs, cockroaches, fluffy once-white-now-yellow carpet with mystery grey stains all over it. Got a cool freelance writing job writing three episodes of a children’s show produced in Spain and airing in Mexico and Russia (thanks Prof!). Got a part-time gig at a Podcast Network working with talented goofballs and a broey boss. Did contractor work for a Casting Agency. All at the same time for a little less then a year. Then BAM. I got a tremendous opportunity to be the Writers’ PA on a show I love and so do most people who watch modern television. Fast forward six months later. I’m exhausted. That was Writers’ Room bootcamp. I loved all the writers–-never ending discussion of story, eager to share their experiences and advice. When you enter a room though, you literally get NO training. And I had been fortunate enough to work in environments involving collaboration and mentorship. Now? It was up to me to figure out what the heck a “Writers’ PA” does and how they do it. Because, for whatever reason, all the rules and procedures are unspoken. I didn’t go to film school. I have no connections to the film industry except the ones I’ve fostered on my own since moving here. All my friends? Not in the film industry. The ones I’ve made in LA? Not doing assistant work. I could write a book on my experience figuring out how to be a Writers’ PA. I learned how silly it is to trust people off the bat. I should have started out LEARNING who to trust, versus just suddenly trusting them. Again, I’m not talking about the writers. Maybe I’ll write something about some of the incidents. In a private journal. Why would I do that though? I need to stop silencing myself. How will I ever develop a voice if I silence myself? Okay, so check in now. I have written a pilot with a friend. I have developed a pilot I need to freaking scale back on in order to actually write. I have published satirical articles. I have written three episodes of that children’s show. I have successfully pitched ideas to the people I worked with that will be in the upcoming season. I’m involved in local theatre. I auditioned for a thing, will not get it, but I had to do it for disciplinary reasons. My writing partner and I are working on a comedy vid to submit to a contest and another pilot. We got to the final round of a fellowship, so I think if a good thing happened with our last pilot, another good thing can happen with this pilot. I’m strong where she is weak and she’s strong where I am weak. I’m socialable, strategic, GREAT at character and description, positive. She’s focused, dry, reliable, trustworthy, can plot like a boss, one liners like a king. We’re both intelligent, funny and creative. I like her. I love her! But now I’m unemployed. I feel nervous all the time and unmotivated. Uncertain if I want to go through the trials and tribulations of an aspiring writer, especially because I feel I don’t have the disciplinary habits necessary for an independent writer. Put me on a team and I’m golden. Give me a deadline and I’ll meet it. You’ll pay for 1000 words? Tell me when and where and I’ll give you a 1000 words. But I’m struggling to craft original spec samples on my own and that is what you fucking need to get hired on a show. I need money. I need to find steady income. I need to move to a new place next month, with two non-strangers! Friends, even! Yay! But also… I miss my college friends. Who are just as lost as I am, despite the fact we all freaking excelled during college. I’m tired and going to sleep. Peace.",2017
"My Words, My Music, My Depression","It’s been hard talking about this. I’ve for the most part, been the go-to person for my friends. I listen to them share with me, their joys, fears and vulnerabilities without judgment and help out however I can. But it’s been hard doing the same because while I feel knowledge is power, ignorance is also bliss, and in this light, Knowledge can be a burden unto others. They don’t know, so they’re fine because they won’t need to bother about me. Right? Wrong. It’s good to talk. I tell everyone that, but I haven’t really taken my advice until lately. Before that, I somehow get this invisible but awfully heavy weight on my mental shoulders. And when it gets like this, I’m more or less inclined to pray for death. Someone said that depression is like living in a body that tries to live while struggling with a mind that tries to die. I couldn’t agree more. There are people around me and I feel alone still. I go to bed hoping not to wake up because I’m so scared of what lies ahead. For me, I’ve been a busy person and with time, as I began to look deeper into some triggers of what was wrong with me, I realized that while I appreciated having my hands full, stress overtime takes me down a very slippery slope. You’re so busy you unconsciously yell out, “What’s the point of all this? Let me just die please!” Yeah, being depressed can make one suicidal. For me, I never for once thought of ‘offing’ myself. I wouldn’t harm myself but I thought about death a lot; very early in the morning, and late at night. I just wanted to die because I was so tired, physically stressed and mentally fatigued. And sometimes, it doesn’t help when you’re broke but that’s not even half of it. I could be fine all round and still end up depressed. What was amazing was that with everyone, I was still making jokes and being goofy on the outside, inside, I was dying. I wasn’t ready for new challenges, opportunities scared me shitless and I just wanted to disappear. Music and writing changed it for me because while I didn’t want to talk, or I wasn’t at that stage yet where I was comfortable ‘sharing’, they gave me an outlet. So, I could say or express how I felt even though I wasn’t really ‘saying’ anything. Someone else felt how I felt and was brave enough to say it — sing it, to tell me. And that was such a huge relief. I listen to heavy music even though I’m a relatively quiet person. With it, every agonizing scream I can’t let out gets expressed. It fed my spirit and as crazy as it sounds, encouraged me to get up and go again. It encouraged me to see those around me who loved me and never lose that for anything. That even though life can sometimes be suffocating, I’m not short of air and I could still breathe. It counts. So, when I’m under that blanket of gloom, I get help. Today there are a few people I can talk to who are always ready to listen. There’s MANI, an awesome NGO encouraging people to speak out, get help and help out, and for me, there’s still music. It’s not a cure so it’s fitting when someone sings about the depths of darkness and despair we sometimes find ourselves in but chooses not to dwell on that alone, but also to tell us that there’s a way out. Talk, get help and well, it doesn’t hurt to sing and dance a little too. Contributing Writer Mentally Aware Nigeria Initiative Originally published at Mentally Aware Nigeria Initiative.",2017
Can We Live Without an Alarm Clock?,"We all love our alarm clocks. We love them so much we sleep with them and we wake up with them. We love them so much we have an app for them right on our home screens. We go as far as setting many alarm clocks, because they feel so good. One for when we would like to wake up, one for when we should wake up and the desperate, urgent one… that we will snooze so we can hear that lovely tune again. We have such a profound relationship with our alarm clocks, it’s the first thing in our morning routines. Every day of the week. Ok, so… I might be overstating it a bit. In 2017 I became a freelance designer of digital products. And there was one key reason for that: take back control of my time. I want to spend my time on thrilling design projects. I want to read more books, sleep more hours and spend a joyful time with people that matter. Not specifically in this order. Recently, there were three key reasons that led me to decide to ditch my alarm clock. I hate alarm clocks. As simple as that. They are dramatic and self-centered. But I needed them. For my previous jobs, I had to arrive to the office on time, so I had to wake up on time. No matter how many hours I had actually slept, no matter how rested I was, I couldn’t wake up without an alarm. They had to be there to aggressively interrupt my sleep. I’ve used real alarm clocks. I’ve used the standard clock app on the iPhone. And I’ve used natural waking up apps. But I would hate it and dread having to actually wake up. This isn’t how you start the day on a positive note. My girlfriend is now studying abroad for a full year. She is living in a new house with a few friends close to the university. And her bedroom window has no blinds of any form. This wasn’t something she was happy about. But for the first nights, there was nothing she could do about it. So she started to wake up with the sun flooding her room. She still had the alarm clock. But most of the times she was already awake by the time it rang. Overtime, she realised how it affected her morning mood for the better. She was waking up earlier and in a natural way. I dismissed it initially. I though it was an unfortunate thing and felt pride in my blinds. A few weeks ago, I read an interview of Jason Fried on Lifehacker on how he works. It’s a worthy, quick read. By the end of it, the interviewer Andy Orin asks: “What’s your sleep routine like? Are you a night owl or early-riser?”. Jason answers: ~8 hours a night. Neglecting sleep is a terrible mistake. It’s the one debt you can never pay off, and it affects everyone around you, too. I go to sleep around 10ish, and get up around 6ish — either to the sun or to my son. […] As far as an actual alarm clock — I haven’t used one in 10 years. I never schedule anything that would require me to be up before my natural wake-up time, so I just get up naturally. Forcing yourself awake at an arbitrary time is a good way to have a shitty morning. For the past 10 years, Jason Fried hasn’t used an alarm clock, he has been waking up to the sun, and sleeping around 8 hours. It made sense to me but I wondered how I could achieve it. So I mapped it out: I decided to try it out this past week and take it as an experiment. So, no blinds closed. No early appointments or meetings. No alarm clocks. By Tuesday I was naturally awake by 7:30am and amazed with it. For an experiment, it’s early to jump into conclusions. But I’ve enjoyed it a lot and I’m quite excited for having made this small change to my daily routine. So far, it’s working and I’m keeping it this way. I sleep what I have to sleep and wake up when I have to wake up. It removes so much of the anxiety and stress of the morning. And I’m naturally more relaxed and positive every day. And now there’s one less reason to charge the iPhone by the bed. But one thing at a time…",2017
Start Worrying: How to Harness Anxious Thoughts to Better Your Life,"I know, it’s an audacious title; something that probaby promises more than it can deliver. But I’ve discovered something that really works. It’s doesn’t come out of wisdom or research or knowledge. I honestly stumbled upon the idea out of pure luck. It’s simple. It works. And I’ll keep the writing here simple as well. The basic premise is that we aren’t all mad; that we aren’t all completely out of our minds. I think most of you agree with that. So then the question is why do we worry so damn much? We’re fraying our nerves; our spines, our guts and our stomachs are all eating themselves alive. Why? Sure, I don’t doubt that the pace of our lives and our media consumption has a lot to do with it. I’ve noticed improvement in my own stress levels from reducing my input. But at the heart of every anxiety; every ball of stress, is a worry. We abuse ourselves with repetitive worries cycling through our brains. Some doctors give us pills to chill out. Other’s say we need to learn to let go. But I think there’s something more there. I’m not a doctor and I wouldn’t claim to know better than them, but what I do know is that every worry is rooted in something specific. There’s always something down at the core of everything over which we starve ourselves or pull out of hair for. And we often take so little time for self contemplation that we are unable to identify what the true situation at hand actually is. Instead we juggle chainsaws, somehow convincing ourselves that by stressing out over something, we are making it better. But worry is not solution. We all know that. In the words of Van Wilder: “Worrying is like a rocking chair. It gives you something to do, but it doesn’t get you anywhere.” Ok, so let’s get to the meat already. Right? What am I really talking about? Why should we start worrying? And what good can come from that? Our first problem is that we allow worry to invades our lives. It pops up where and whenever it wants, shitting on whatever it come into contact with. And the only remedy we are offered is to let it go; to ignore it; to push it out. But that doesn’t work very well does it? And if doesn’t work well then we have to wonder if maybe we’re thinking of it all wrong. What if I told you to go ahead and worry, to go ahead and freak out all that you want? You’d proababy say that I’m nuts or and idiot, but that’s exactly what I’m suggesting you to do. Worry, worry, worry — but only for 30 minutes every day. I want you to schedule a thirty minute window every day for worrying. I’m not being metaphorical. Put aside thirty minutes of every day and label that as your worry time. First of all, as crazy as it sounds, there’s something freeing about the idea isn’t there. By allowing it a place in our lives we no longer have to carry the shame, guilt and yes, the worry that we have over the habit of worrying itself. Second of all, what’s important to know about this thirty minutes is that it is the only time during the day that you are allowed to worry. What this means is that when a worry pops into your head during the rest of the day, rather than fighting it, you reschedule it. If you have to, talk out loud. “Sorry worry, it’s not you’re time. We will talk tonight.” And then write down that worry for reference later and move on. And that’s it. Just kidding. That isn’t even the important part. We still have to deal with the real clickbaity part of my title: “Harness Anxious Thoughts to Better Your Life.” So, how do we do that? Well, that’s where your thirty minutes come in. This is what you actually do during these thirty minutes. List out every single worry that you can think of that is on your mind — big, small, logical, crazy — all of them. The first day will probably be the longest (but who knows.) You’ll proabably run out of steam pretty fast, but I encourage you to push past this and to really dig. Go until you literally can’t think of any more worries. Find the true limit. Why are we writing them down? You guessed it, because we are gonna look at each of them and do some thinking. The first question you are gonna ask as you look at each worry is: “What’s the worst possible thing that can happen?” I’ll share with you one of my own personal stresses. On day one, I wrote down “I worry about my heart health.” I smoked cigarettes for 18 years, I ate a poor diet, I never exercised and I’m twenty pounds overweight. Though I have no signs of heart disease yet, it’s a real worry. And when my anxiety takes over and throws me into a panic attack, the first thing I think is that I’m having a heart attack. So I guess, as blunt as it is, my worse case scenario is that I actually will die. Damn. That’s not very uplifting or healthy is it? Luckily, this question is only the first of two. The next question I want you to ask is: “What can I actually do about it?” And this is the hardest step out of everything that I’ve written here. It requires you to really understand what you’re worry is actually telling you. After all that’s the whole point of this article, that we aren’t insane; that the reason we worry is because we are trying to tell ourselves something. A worry is like an alarm. We don’t want to just turn them off. We want to find out what set them off. In my case, I found four actionable steps. Actionable steps are spefic actions that you can take. Tangible things. For example, I’m worried about my heart, so I need to: Every one of these is something that I can put into action immediately. And that’s our goal here. As best as you can, try to find true actionable steps, things that you can put into a todo app, schedule and complete. This is where you begin to improve your life. As we allot time to listen to and understand our worries, we begin to make progress. From one worry I was able to see the need to make three changes to improve my health. And the apointment with the cardiologist will give me some understanding of where I actually stand with my heart health. If my heart is healthy then I have information to battle my next panic attack (though hopefully there isn’t a next one), and if it isn’t in tip-top condition then I have more motivation for my diet and exercise changes. Now to be clear, there may not always be a cut-and-dry action steps from every worry. Sometimes the action step in just acknowledging something and accepting it. “I worry that I will die one day.” Yup. You will. You can’t prevent it, so maybe your action steps are “accept the inevitability of death” & “find joy and happiness in every day.” But…personally, I wouldn’t even be happy with those steps. I’d want to dig deeper. What scares me about death specifically? How can I come to terms with that? What steps can I take to find joy? and happiness? Basically what I’m saying here is that the deeper you dig to find specific actions that you can take, the more benefit your worries will bring into your life. It’s all up to you. If you give yourself fully to this practice you will continually surprise yourself. You will discover worries that you weren’t consciously aware of. You will find needs that you weren’t meeting. You will find things you’ve been wanting to do, suddenly getting done. And after time you’ll discover that your worry list gets shorter every day, because worries don’t return unless they still have something to say. If you take your steps then they eventually go away.",2017
How to Become Fearless,"When I was a child, I devoured books about strong girls. Old fashioned novels about girls who lived in the woods, and who loved life with this big, abundant abandon. Girls who faced the worst life would give and rose, who were willing to be brave and unapologetically smart. I read Gone with the Wind for the first time when I was ten, and I revered Scarlett O’Hara in all her petty meanness and selfish immaturity — here was a woman bent on survival. I consumed stories about fearless women, because I imagined that someday, I would grow into a fearless woman. This word — for me, it was a world unto itself. I think as a kid, I spent more time thinking about my identity than I did trying to create — or at least project — it. Because of that, there were a few individual words — fearlessness among them — that became so big, so prominent in my mental geography. I was this, or at least I would be, when I grew up. There are a few moments from my life that stand as highway marker, and this is one: In the middle of my freshman year of college mental health crisis, I got lost on a city bus. I misread the schedule or misread the bus — I’m still not sure which — but I wound up getting deposited at an empty transit station, in the wrong downtown, on a street that I did not recognize. I was terrified. And not because I didn’t know where I was. This was only six years ago — I had a cell phone with a GPS, and access to both the city wide bus schedule, and people with cars would could come pick me up. I collapsed in an empty hallway, on a carpet with green and gray squares, and I began to weep. I was so, desperately afraid of absolutely everything. The life I’d been dreaming of since I was a little kid was far, far too big for me, and I was only at the beginning. I was staring down the barrel of my adulthood, and I knew deep in my bones that I was not fearless. I was fear. Without realizing what I was doing, I had accumulated and indexed fears until I was a walking atlas of them. I was afraid: that my parents would be killed in a car crash, that someone in the transit station would approach me with a question, that I would be invited to a social event and not know what to do, AND that there would be a social gathering and I would not be invited, that my brother would be killed by a shooter at his high school, and that I would never make any friends. I was afraid that I would never write again. I was afraid of my dormitory hallways, and especially afraid of the cafeterias, and afraid of how lonely I was, and afraid of how difficult it was to make friends. I even remember lying awake one night and worrying that I would never have friend with whom I was close enough to fear that someday they too may die a painful and untimely death. (Crazy, I know). I was a whole landscape of fear, a country of worry held together only by very fragile bones. — In the months following that breakdown, I had to deal very seriously with my identity. It is truly the only time in my life when I felt utterly lost from myself, and at odds with who I thought I’d been. It wasn’t just that I wasn’t “fearless,” because although I was not, my identity was unstable at a much more fundamental level. I did, however, have to confront the magnitude of my fears. Ongoing treatment and care for my anxiety has significantly lessened the weight of fear in my life, and the strength of my fears have lessened — less “what is my momdies in a car accident?” and more “how would I afford a car payment if my transition drops out.” But they are still very, very much with me. I used to think that I was letting down the young version of myself who thought that strength would be measured, like it was for my heroines, by how little I feared. But here’s the thing. I’ve reread most of my favorite books from my childhood, and I don’t see fearless women anymore. I see fear. These stories are shaped by fear! They’re only compelling because of the fear. Because it’s not a lack of fear that makes Anne beg Matthew and Marilla to keep her, or that makes Hermione brave enough to partner with Harry, or that gives Eowyn the strength to pull off her helmet and look evil in the eye. It’s the decision to act in spite of the fear. Every single character that I ever adored all had a set of fears unique to themselves, and every single one of them saw their fear, their worst fears, running after them, and not a single one of them ducked. That’s why I loved them. That’s why I wanted to be them. Fearlessness is not the goal. For me, fear is a companion that I didn’t invite into my house, but that is here, because sometimes it keeps me alive. Maybe it will change, but I doubt it — I’m predisposed to panic, and my craft is my overactive imagination. At this point, fear is in the house, and I can’t make it leave. I can, however, make it sit in the corner, in the uncomfortable chair, facing the wall. I can tell it to shut up when it starts to drown out the guests that I actually invited over. When it convinces me that the phone only rings when someone dies, or that I can’t take down my Christmas tree, because my dad cut it down, and what if my dad dies before he can down a new tree for me, then I’ll send it to a different room, and make it stare at a blank wall in there. Giving fear power in the moments when it doesn’t have a valid claim only makes the moments when fear is real, and when it is warranted that much harder. Because fear comes when what we love is threatened. And if we’re being honest, life does not promise to protect that which we life. One of the very few things we’re promised is suffering. Life will hurt badly. As a friend reminded me after my grandfather died, what I was feeling just then was the result of the very best that life can give — 86 years lived, 64 years married, 6 children grown, 14 grandchildren, 5 great-grandchildren. That’s the best, and that aches. We’ve all read this before: If we live long enough, everyone we’ve ever loved will die, and if we don’t, we’ll leave behind people in pain. Fear cannot change the facts. It will only make it harder to live with them. This is a hard truth to hold in your hand — I believe it maybe 2 out of every 50 days, and I act out of that belief only 1. Fear is powerful and seductive, and it is almost all empty promises, broken cisterns that leak water when you’re most in need. Life comes after us, whether we want it to or not. And all my fearing, all my empty worrying, my obsessive indexing of catastrophe, has not prepared me for what happens when the thing I’ve feared becomes the thing that’s real, and takes its own seat at the table.

Being Your Own Boss When There’s A Deadline,"So recently, I quit all my most time consuming jobs to focus on giving my pet project Aliens with Visas, all the momentum it needs for a successful launch in the next couple of months. It has been great in some ways. I’ll get to that in a minute because once you’re grateful, resentment is hard to express. I feel like every minute needs to be accounted for. I can’t stop being hard on myself for not spending every second in focus. So it starts with just getting up. If I decide to wake up at 6 and wake up at 7.30am, I DO subconsciously dwell on that and think up ways to include more efficiency in my life. And God forbid I have any sort of meeting in the day; be it a casual hangout or a yoga class. I literally weigh every activity against that. So if I have a 6pm yoga class, I will decide not to hang out in the park at 11am. Just not worth it. The commuting time. For a 6pm class, I need to leave home by 5.15, which means start getting dressed at 4.50pm. Tea time will hence have to happen at 4pm, and…. You see how this goes. Also, I have to Yelp a place, and then I’ll get hungry and want to spend money on food and who’s going to finish all this basil, arugula and all the verge-of-death greens. And lately, this FOMO on sunny days. Because contrary to what La La Land suggests, Los Angeles is not always sunny! We’ve been having some heavily overcast days with rains and I feel so bad when I don’t capitalize on sunshine. I mean lovely sunshine with a breeze, not Dubai/India kind of face melting heat (and pollution). Sounds like I’m sort of afraid the sun won’t come shine in my face with all its glory. DUDE THE SUN IS RELIABLE, THERE WILL BE SUNNY DAYS. SHEESH. When I try to plan my day around a premise, all hell breaks loose. When I have no plan, which means military style breakdown of what exactly needs to be done and switching between tasks every 45min, it’s a slow day. And then social media. Social frickin’ media. The one inevitable zone where I lose consciousness of time. Idle scrolling has given way to lesser idle scrolling with loud inner monologue of ‘STOP, it’s happening, black hole, watch out, don’t click on that booty p..’. I have no Netflix, cable, Amazon Prime, Hulu, whatever else and I don’t like streaming from sites that throw pop ups in your face. But that means, YouTube and Reddit. And I hang out on FB to get linked to videos or dumb articles. I don’t engage as much on the actual platform. Just the other day I spent way too much time watching ‘the veritable geyser of cringe’ that is Wendy Williams and on this Reddit thread that was pure gold. Is it days of uninterrupted productivity? I want to focus on just the moment, just the task at hand, but life requires some planning if you have variables like traffic and certain timelines or deadlines. It is pretty embarrassing to type all of this. I probably come off as a neurotic but hey I swear I’m fun! When you want to really do something, make something awesome, but you seem to not be meeting your own expectations, it just… The real lesson here is to be wholly present to the task at hand, even against all odds. Those odds could be very valid concerns of the future or the makings of a hyperactive mind. I have got to overcome my Virgo shortcomings of being mired in perfectionism and in my head. If I can get this going to its full potential — but without letting the no’s & lack of responses and whatever roadblocks get me down, if I can get this out with my sanity intact, preferably by learning to control that mere object that is the mind… That would be so, so great.",2017
What are the Early Warning Signs of Teen Mental Health Issues?,"Adolescence is a time of unexpected changes, both for parents and teens. As teenagers go through a variety of transitions emotionally, sexually, physically, hormonally, intellectually and socially, parents are often left wondering if specific changes in moods or behavior are simply normal teens going through normal teen years or something much more serious, like mental health issues. If you’re wondering whether your daughter is suffering from mental health problems, knowing the signs of these issues is important. There are a variety of mental health disorders, but some major red flags to watch out for include: · Excessive sleeping · Unexpected decline in academic performance · Loss of interest in favorite activities · Loss of self-esteem · Sudden weight loss or appetite changes · Significant shift in personality out of character for her In addition to watching for these red flags, you should also be on the lookout for signs and symptoms of the most common mental health issues affecting teens. Everyone feels sad every once in a while. However, if your daughter is experiencing the following symptoms, it may indicate she is suffering from depression. · Changes in sleeping patterns · Noticeable weight gain or loss · Unexpected moodiness · Excessive secrecy · Paranoia · Expressions of worthlessness · Self-harm · Excessive isolation · Abandonment of friends Concerns about body image can quickly become obsessive and can affect your teen’s physical health. Anorexia is a type of eating disorder that involves the avoidance of food. Your daughter may stop eating entirely or eat very little. Bulimia is another eating disorder. Teens often consume large amounts of food, then purge (forcefully vomit) the food after the meal to avoid gaining weight. In some cases, bulimics may also use laxatives to get rid of the food they have consumed. While it’s normal for your teen to worry about an upcoming test or whether a boy at school likes her, excessive worry can be a sign of something far worse. Anxiety comes in a variety of forms and can even produce physical symptoms with no physical cause. Your daughter may complain of stomachaches, tiredness and trouble sleeping. In addition, she may constantly worry, despite your reassurances, and be overly critical of herself. She may avoid social activities, but actively seek the approval of adults in her life. At Greenbrier Academy for Girls, we believe that the primary reason behind the mental health symptoms your daughter may be experiencing, such as anxiety, depression and eating disorders, are her perceptions of relational experiences in her past, present and future. At our boarding school, our therapeutic program uses a variety of techniques to help your daughter address these perceptions, understand them and change them so that her present and future relational experiences are more positive. We incorporate this belief into one-on-one therapy, the Village, family workshops, art therapy, community service and group therapy. In addition, we have an off-campus psychiatrist who provides regular psychiatric services and monitors student medications.",2017
Silent Agony,"So… I’ve had something weighing on my chest for a few weeks now… I’ve been a bit quiet on the FB front recently… It’s because severaly weeks ago, during a period of time that I was struggling with feelings of inadequacy and lonelyness and emotional turmoil, a number of people approached me and expressed discomfort. They were discomforted with the fact that I posted so freely about how I feel… about how much emotional pain I am in… they didn’t know how to cope with it, they didn’t know how to respond to it and while no one told me specifically to keep my struggles to myself, I got the impression that they would rather not see it because they don’t know how to respond to it… and I felt horrible for making people uncomfortable… I get it, I really do… they see a guy like me feeling worthless and lonely and a waste of space and time, and all they can think about is their relatives or friends or acquaintances who committed suicide and it makes them uncomfortable… it makes them wonder what they did wrong, what they could have done to change the outcome and ultimately… it just brings up some really tough feelings to cope with, some people are trying to process their losses and seeing someone like me suffering from mental health disorders serves to reopen that wound in some ways… so I get it… However in the last two days, I’ve been blessed to see four of my friends very bluntly open up about their emotional, and psychological mental health challenges and basically say yes, I suffer and I won’t be quiet about it because I’m allowed to be me and express myself… I wish everyone could feel as comfortable being honest about their mental health challenges as these great people are... Noone seems to be afraid to talk about their diabetes challenges or their cancer challenges or their other physical ailments and everyone wants to stand and support them when they struggle to cope with them... but our society clams the fuck up when we start talking about our mental health disorders... and people get uncomfortable and just want you to stop talking about them... WE HAVE TO STOP THAT! Silence is what kills more mental health patients than anything else. The need to bottle up and stay quiet for fear of making others uncomfortable, The fear of expressing their pain because it would make someone criticize them, andThe rejection of others when they reach out in need because ‘It’s all in your head, you have to choose to be happy”. They feel this way, not because it’s true but because without open discussions of mental health disorders, we have only our own thoughts to contend with… we only have our own internal dialogue to guide us... and that internal dialogue is NOT right… we NEED support from our friends family and aquaintances… we need to change the perception and we need to stop making people feel uncomfortable sharing their needs and struggles and fears and pains… If you don’t like what I have to say, if you can’t cope, if you think its personal weakness and bullshit and not real… that’s fair… feel how you do, feel free to walk your finger to the unfriend button, its ok… unfriend me I get it… its ok… I won’t take it personally… but heres’ me. I suffer from severe and debilitating Social and Generalized Anxiety Disorders as well as Chronic Insomnia... I take medication to combat it… I take between 12 and 16 pills a day to cope with all of my health concerns… generally they work… but they don’t always work… I hit lows where I LITERALLY (as in actually as opposed to figuratively) avoid all human contact for days on end... I will hide in my room 23 hours a day, avoiding even my own daughter, because human interaction is sometimes so painful and debilitating... It’s the most difficult part of my mental health disorder… I hate being around people but I hate being alone with myself… I throw myself into my TV shows because I can forget about my own life, immerse myself in the fiction and not think about me and all the things I’m sure are bad and wrong about me… and I need my escape to cope… if I didn’t have that escape… I don’t know how I would cope… i need to shut the world out and go to my fantasy place… I yearn, at all times, for my bed… I don’t want to be in my office right now, I don’t want to talk to my boss or my coworkers… I just want to get away from it all and be in bed with my TV shows… but yet if you speak with my boss and my coworkers, you would hear that I chat and joke and generally seem ok every day… and that’s because I enjoy their company… I do, I like talking with people and interacting with them at work… but I don’t… its so hard to explain this dichotomy that is my emotional state at all times… I will avoid social gatherings… and its hard… I WANT to be loved and surrounded by people who care about me… but what I crave TERRIFIES me… I worry about saying stupid things, about doing something that will embarrass me… what if someone asks me something and I don’t know how to answer… what if I make a mess on myself… what if I get caught in a circle of people and I can’t physically remove myself from it… I get so worked up with what ifs that I just don’t go… what if what if what if I can’t have my routines messed up with… like… I walk to work the EXACT same path, every single day… and I cannot cope with it being changed… Like NOT AT ALL… any changes to my routine upsets me… if I wake up and I planned to go to the pool and then take the ferry across the harbour to the library and for some reason the ferry isn’t running and we have to change the plan even a little bit… its time to go home… I’m spent… If I have to go to the washroom at work and someone is using MY stall… I hold it and walk away until its free… I cannot even fathom doing my business in a different stall… that’s MY stall… its stupid I know but its true… So… that’s me… I am not going to be quiet, I am not going to worry about my words and fall back into the fear and secrecy that had me off work for months before anyone knew I was off work… that had me lying about how I felt because ‘ I need to be strong’ when I honestly wasn’t strong… I’m going to share what I feel and how I feel and if that bothers you, that’s understandable… but I need to share… because I don’t want to button it all up, and increase the pressure and end up… well… finishing things myself. I don’t want that… I can’t do that… my daughter needs me to be there for her… and the only way I can be sure that I do, is to be bluntly honest when I’m in pain… and ultimately i refuse to feed into the same routine and circle... i refuse to reinforce the same cycle of shame and fear that surrounds mental health disorders...

Why Trump’s Presidency Increases My Anxiety,"By Kelly Leading up to the election, there was no doubt in my mind America was about to see its first female president. I had no anxiety about the election, there was no chance that America would elect a man who spewed as much hatred as he breathed. The day of, I remember walking by the building where votes were being placed, thinking that my vote would not affect anything; Hillary Clinton would be elected president with or without my vote. As the day went on and results of different states began being reported, I was shocked at the amount of red on the electoral map. My anxiety grew as the number of electoral votes needed grew smaller for Donald Trump. Everything in me knew that this could not lead to any good; especially when the protests began before all the results were in. When it became official that Trump had gained the most electoral votes, I had the worst feeling in my stomach. I was with my friends and floormates when it was announced that Donald Trump would be our next president. Within this group of friends, I instantly recognized that one of them was more terrified than the rest. He was of Middle-Eastern descent and even though he was upset too, he comforted me and told me why it was going to be okay. I left his room feeling okay about the future of America and decided to go to bed. As I began to drift off to sleep, I woke up to my phone buzzing, my roommate, who is Mexican, was just coming back from the protests and had forgotten her key. I opened the door for her and could hear the tears in her voice that she tried to conceal in the pitch blackness of the room. She had come back to our room so that she could call her mother. It really struck me how one of her first instincts upon hearing this news was to call her mother. With the little Spanish I knew, I pieced together that she was breaking the news to her mother about the next president and seeking comfort in her, even joking about moving to Canada. I may not have been able to translate the entire conversation but I did not need to understand Spanish to hear the pain and fear in her voice. She had previously shared with me that she was undocumented, allowed to stay here due to an immigration policy: Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals or DACA. I teared up hearing her cry and speaking to her mother and I realized how wrong it was that a man who inspired so much fear and hatred was elected president. Despite identifying with a few minoritized groups, I recognized that I had privilege in that moment. I felt my privilege as I heard my roommate crying because she was terrified for her family and herself due to their status. The experience of witnessing my roommate’s reaction shook me to the core and made me feel the urgency of how frightening it was to have Trump be our next president. Then it was my turn to feel terrified. The days following the election, there seemed to be a surge of hate crimes against minoritized groups and I understood the feeling of being terrified for the safety of my family, friends, and myself. I had multiple anxiety attacks anytime I would go on social media and see the chaotic aftermath of the election. Not only was I anxious, I was mad. Facebook seems to be the hub of overly opinionated people and every comment I read about “over sensitive liberals” being “sore losers” because their candidate had lost reinforced the idea of what privilege looks like. I was not upset because a Republican president would mean a different set of ideals but because this one promised to do everything in his power to take away the rights of minoritized groups. I was not scared because Trump was going to be in office, but because people voted the idea of him in. There are people in this world who genuinely believe the horribly racist, misogynistic, xenophobic, and Islamophobic statements he makes and suddenly, the country does not feel safe anymore with the promise of him being the next president. I strongly believe that everyone should be able to hold whatever beliefs they want without being judged but I could never understand how someone could vote for a man who so strongly voices his disgust and bigotry for entire groups of people. Another result of this election that upset me, aside from the ignorance from Facebook commenters, was the ignorance from my own friends. I had a friend who would constantly trivialize my concerns who was the physical embodiment of an all-American male. He had blonde hair, blue eyes, and pale skin. He also came from a financial background that did not qualify him for financial aid but also one that did not require him to work despite this. Anytime I would bring up my fears surrounding the potential results of the election, he would minimize my fears and do everything to invalidate them; brushing them off as if they were no big deal. But they are a big deal. I remember a day when my roommate and I were so petrified from the hate crimes going on in the world that we did not want to leave our rooms, let alone campus. There were numerous posts on Facebook with students urging fellow students to email teachers to postpone midterms because they had so much anxiety over the safety of their families that they could not even begin to take in the anxiety induced by testing. I read numerous stories of people being targeted for hate crimes a mere day after the election. My own friends were harassed for being gay in the place where I grew up: San Francisco, one of the most liberal cities in the United States, and the place that I called home did not even feel safe. There was a video posted online from a UC Santa Cruz student who was verbally assaulted at a bus stop and a handful of reports of incidents occurring on campus. All of these reports and personal accounts came in within days of the election so for someone to tell me I was overreacting, that I should not worry about it, made me want to open their eyes to how devastating and terrifying this was for so many minoritized groups. One of the most upsetting comments I have heard from conservatives is, “now liberals know how Republicans felt when Obama was elected.” But they have absolutely no idea that this is so much more than just a difference in political views. I cannot recall anyone being concerned for their safety when Obama was elected. I cannot recall an uproar of absolute hatred on both sides. I cannot recall the United States feeling so divided.

Kindly Calm Me Down,"Most times the baby is hungry or uncomfortable or sleepy and the sound usually conquers the wailing especially when they are sleepy. Although it’s common knowledge that when it comes to hunger no amount of sounds can quench those pangs. I like Meghan Trainor as a person because she is so comfortable in her figure and prides herself especially through her music. The first time I listened to “All About That Bass” I was like “who is this babe!”. The song that prompted me to download her Thank You album wasn’t any song on the album but “Dear Future Husband”. I said to myself “She’s not my typical go-to-artist, but I love her creativity”. My favorite track on the album is “Goosebumps”, but the focus of this post today is on “Kindly Calm Me Down”. Once in a while we all experience intense days, fortunately for some, they can ‘snap’ out of it and get back to ‘normal’, but the reality is that some don’t and can’t. Listening to the song for the first time, I thought it was a love song, but then I listened again, and a whole new perspective jumped in my mind. “This song would be good for people coping with bipolar; people who experience frequent episodes”. But in truth, everyone can relate to this song. The first verse sounds like a poem… So cold, alone Could you be my blanket? Surround my bones When my heart feels naked No strength too weak I could use some saving And your love’s so strong Like a pill, I take it But the chorus is what I relate with constantly: When my world gets loud, could you make it quiet down? When my head, it pounds, could you turn down all the sound? If I lay in pain, by my side would you stay? If I need you now, would you kindly calm me down? People battling with any form of illness need to be surrounded with strong people. People that will serve as their support just by staying around. Sometimes you don’t even have to say anything; a hug means more than ten thousand words would. Most times when I fall into depression, I don’t even know how to explain how I feel, if you ask me “tell me what’s wrong?” “I just say you won’t understand”, but my mind is screaming “just tell me everything would be okay, just sit close to me, don’t judge me, just hold me, just hug me”. I hope there’s someone reading this is who is willing to be there for another who is struggling; there to kindly calm someone who is anxious.

Anxiety is My Friend,"A few months ago I would have told you that anxiety is this unwanted pressure that lurks in my body. For three months I felt that my anxiety was a burden on my life. Like I couldn’t do anything because anxiety was setting in and my chest was hurting all of the time and causing me to stop accomplishing my routine with glee. I was wrong. Although I don’t particularly care for the way anxiety feels, I’ve recently decided to accept that my brain cares enough for me that it speaks out via innate emotions. Anxiety is a normal reaction to fear, dangerous situations, etc. My body is actually programmed to say, “Hello, check yourself.” My initial response used to entail, “Alright, fine. I’ll calm the fuck down and you can go. Just go! I’m OKAY. I don’t need your damn pressure.” But the chest pain would just sit there and I would lie there scared for hours. Lately, when I feel pressure on my chest I stop. I listen. I breathe deeply and try to imagine something that makes me laugh. I thank anxiety and start listening to what my body needs. Maybe it’s rest, maybe it’s oxygen. Sometimes it’s a Wanna BLT from Bouldin Creek Cafe (delicious, I tell you). Sometimes I have to take a fucking hour off work to go do something else. And you know what? Worth. Let’s face it. Most of us have emotions for a reason. Humans have many chemical reactions going on in their bodies all day long. I have decided my job is to give myself a break once in a while. So far this method is working well and I hope anxiety becomes more of an acquaintance.",2017

Uncontrollable Stress #2,"I live with a great many regrets. When I get overwhelmed or passionate about the truth (regardless of whether I’m correct or not), I can tend to say things that I regret. Or more to the point, say things in a way that I later regret. Then, because I really do care about other people and want their best (and because I fear personal rejection), I feel really bad about the way I say things (notice that I generalise it to how I ‘say’ things and not just to how I ‘said’ them. I tend to tell myself that I ‘always’ say things that way, regardless of evidence to the contrary). But here’s the thing: It’s done. No matter how much I replay that moment; no matter how many times I berate myself, punish myself or tell myself I’m a stupid idiot for saying that thing, I have no power to change that thing. It’s out of my control. What I can control is what I tell myself now and how I say things now.",2017

Everything you see in this blog is raw, real talk. No gimmics, no lies, just the steps I take to live my life the way I want to live it. I am a 24 year old redhead with the attitude to match. I'm a wife, a sister, an aunt, a writer, a coach, a warrior, a survivor, a nerd, an enthusiast, a singer, a crochet hooker, and an inspiration. My goal is to make sure each and every person I touch knows just how much they are truely worth. I live with Chronic Back Pain, Degenerative Disc Disease, Sciatica, Endometriosis, Obesity, Depression, and Anxiety. I've had emotional highs and very deep lows, sometimes in the same day. My pain, on a good day, is no lower than a 6 and I have to take several medications to keep it that low. The hospital knows me by name from all the appointments and ER vistits I've had in the past year, alone. I work from home as a Customer Service Rep because I can't feel most of my right leg, so I can't drive. Before my back got this bad, I was an online fitness coach and LOVED helping all my clients and friends! From my time as a coach, I learned the importance of Personal Development. Books like Playing Big by Tara Mohr completely 180'ed my thought process and helped my depression. Since I was a kid, my selfesteem has been in the toilet. Worse than that, it was in the sewage pipes at the sewage plant! I had no confidence whatsoever. By the time I was 18, I couldn't even look in the mirror without crying. I would stand there for an hour poking and picking at myself. I would lay awake for hours berrading myself for something I said that day, or something I could have done better. No one should ever have to feel that way or put themselves through that. Today I start this blog to end the hate. I will end the hate in me. Are you ready to journey with me?

Você não precisa saber tudo sobre UX,"Este é um texto sobre ansiedade. Muitos profissionais estão começando na área de UX agora. O aumento da visibilidade sobre a disciplina e a crescente consciência sobre a importância de experiências que sejam intuitivas, eficazes e fáceis de usar acabou atraindo muitos profissionais para a nossa área nos últimos anos. E UX é uma área enorme. Aos poucos os entrantes começam a enxergar a amplitude daquilo que fazemos, bem como as diversas áreas pelas quais temos que transitar no decorrer de um projeto. Aqui na agência em que trabalho o profissional de UX está envolvido desde a reunião de kickoff do projeto até o dia em que o produto é lançado — e com frequência muito além desse dia, monitorando e aperfeiçoando o produto pós-lançamento. E no decorrer desse processo são várias as reuniões, conversas, e decisões que têm algum impacto na experiência do usuário — Estratégia, Métricas, Design Visual, Redação, Tom de Voz, Branding, Tecnologia. Aqui nos EUA (e imagino que no Brasil também) é muito comum ver o profissional de UX envolvido em cada uma dessas conversas, em cada uma dessas fases, adicionando a perspectiva do usuário na hora de tomar decisões sobre cada um desses aspectos. E é importante que esse profissional tenha vocabulário e conhecimento técnico suficiente para ter discussões saudáveis com os profissionais de outras disciplinas. Depois do primeiro projeto concluído, o profissional iniciante em UX começa a entender a amplitude de conhecimento técnico necessário para a construção de um produto digital. O problema é: essa visibilidade toda gera ansiedade. Como é que eu vou aprender sobre cada uma dessas disciplinas, ao mesmo tempo em que desempenho os diversos papéis de UX dentro do projeto — de UX Strategy, a Arquitetura de Informação, a Design de Interação, Usabilidade, etc? O conselho que costumo dar a designers mais novos é o seguinte: não se sinta obrigado a aprender tudo logo de cara. Comece de algum lugar mais específico. Enxergue quais são suas habilidades naturais, e comece por elas. E se você não tem uma preferência específica, também não se preocupe. Com o passar do tempo você vai ficando mais familiarizado com as múltiplas disciplinas de User Experience e vai sentir em qual vertical você se sente mais confortável. Sobre esse assunto (e sobre o dilema de ter que fazer uma decisão), recomendo dar uma lida nesse outro artigo que escrevi há algum tempo: brasil.uxdesign.cc Mas dê tempo ao tempo. Você não precisa tomar essa decisão hoje. Você não precisa aprender tudo agora. Prédio que sobe muito rápido, cai muito rápido. “Não se afobe, não, que nada é pra já.”",2017
The Diagnosis — Part II: Thanks for the panic button,"Part 1: I always knew I had cancer The following Monday, I went for my first breast MRI. When the office called to set it up, they’d asked if I was claustrophobic, and I said no. Which is a lie. I’ve freaked out about being in elevators and back seats of cars since I was little, but I guess at the time I thought, I have cancer. What’s a small space going to do to me? At work, I’ve learned about imaging centers that try to calm patient anxiety with music or beach scenes. So, when I walked in and heard techno music playing softly, I thought, That’s weird, but maybe that’s what some people like to listen to. I soon realized that wasn’t music — that’s what the machine sounds like. Not so much relaxing, but more like being trapped inside an ink jet printer. This machine was just as I imagined, except there was something extra — “boob windows.” Instead of lying on your back, for a breast MRI you lie on your stomach and put your breasts through the “windows” so they can get a better look. I can’t wait to tell people about these boob windows, I thought to myself. See, there are opportunities to laugh everywhere. The nurses explained that they would start an IV and run some contrast dye. I’d be in the machine for about 20 minutes, and it would be really loud, like “they handed me ear plugs”- loud. She said that it was important for me to stay still, and if I started freaking out then I could press the panic button and they would take me out. If I panicked, I’d have to come back another day. A PANIC BUTTON. To me that said, “This is scary as sh*t, and it is medically necessary for us to make sure that you can panic.” Seeing my reaction, the nurse asked again if I was claustrophobic. I told her that I “sort of” was (lie! another lie!), but I was very afraid of needles, and I just hadn’t known what to expect. They couldn’t give me any medicine to relax since I’d driven myself, but I could reschedule if I needed to. The nurse was about my age and very sweet. Nope, let’s just get this over with. The nurses assured me that while they wouldn’t be in the room during the MRI, they would be close the whole time. I got faint when they started the IV. Did I mention I hate needles? They helped me get situated on the boob table, with my arms out straight superman-style. I think this is probably the time when I stopped feeling awkward about being topless with so many strangers. My brain only had a few cells free to think of anything other than my imminent doom, and I wasn’t going to waste them on boob shame. Any chance of zoning out and forgetting that I was in a very small, noisy magnetic tube with a needle in my hand and my formerly private body parts now featured in their own window display went away when I could feel my behind graze the opening. Oh no, here I am. Must lose booty weight for future MRIs. The nurse came to the other end of the tube. I didn’t have to lift my head because a mirror under my face reflected her image. She placed the panic button in my right hand just in case I needed it. It seemed like a possibility. They told me that when the dye started, it might feel warm. They did not tell me that it might feel like I’d just peed my pants. And now we all know. For the record, I did not pee my pants. I checked. Even with ear plugs, the machine is very loud. It makes different patterns of noises for a few minutes and then changes. I wouldn’t describe any of them as relaxing, although one sounded like, Yum. Yum. Yum. Yum. I was already at a 9/10 on the stress scale with, you know, just learning that I had cancer and being trapped in a tube and having a needle sticking out of my hand and feeling like I just peed myself in front of all these strangers who just wrangled my murderous boobs into boob windows. When I’m stressed, I subconsciously hold my breath and then let out deep sighs. Yes, it is annoying to everyone around me. Sometimes, I’ll feel like I can’t breathe and end up hyperventilating. Neither of these are good when someone is trying to take a picture of your chest. I got through it by doing some light box breathing (thank you, Brene Brown), thinking about how ridiculous the boob windows and the MRI techno music and the pee pants feeling are, and by thinking, I can do anything for 20 minutes. I was afraid of moving the IV needle, so I’d started with my arms flexed and by the end my arms were shaking. I’d hit a 10/10 on the anxiety scale, but I was happy to be free. I told everyone who asked that this was the worst thing I’d had to do so far, and vowed to be prepared next time and ask for the meds. I went back to work that day, and for the rest of the week I focused on work. Later, my coworker would tell me that she was worried I was upset about our new office layout and was out looking for another job. It was actually the opposite. I love my job. I love working. When I’m super stressed, fight or flight manifests as “nap” or “work.” And I can’t nap on the job, so I was grateful to have meaningful work to distract me. When I was thinking about my cancer goals, it was 1) Live a long time, 2) Get married in December, and 3) Keep working. I didn’t want to tell my coworkers before I had answers from the oncologist, but I had to tell my boss. Not only did I have a lot of mystery blocks on my calendar, but there was a good chance whatever treatment I needed was going to coincide with the culmination of my projects for the year. Luckily, she’s not only a physician, but also a real live human with perspective and understanding. She asked what I needed and volunteered to help me understand and navigate next steps. If you’ve ever wondered how to help someone in a time of crisis — this is a good example. Be empathetic. Offer your special and unique abilities. If you are a manager, treat your employees like people first. Next up… Part 3 of the diagnosis — Triple positive doesn’t mean 3x optimistic.",2017
#BigParentingIdea — Enjoy Your Childhood While It Lasts! (No Wonder Being An Adult Scares The Hell Out Of Them),"Look, your adult life will suck most of the time (because that’s just the way it is — adult life sucks), so get the most joy out of being a child.

Why not that sort of guidance? Why prime them to expect the worst out of their adult lives? No wonder so many kids are afraid (sometimes even scared to death) as they approach adulthood.

"In a Wal-Mart parking lot, with my head between my knees, wondering if I was going to die.","I’ve wanted to say this out loud for a few years now. I’ve wanted to get it out and into the world so bad but I’ve always had something holding me back. I don’t want my peers to think I’m just looking for attention, I don’t want people to look differently at me, and I don’t want to commit to these words because once they’re out there they can’t be taken back. Basically I’ve been afraid for a laundry list of selfish reasons. I have Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD). Anti-climactic — I know. It’s even one of the “hip” mental health disorders. The reason why I want to share these thoughts now is to try to reduce the stigma surrounding mental illnesses. I’ve slowly come to the realization this might be one of the reasons that I’m here on earth. I want to help. It’s more than that. I feel I have an obligation to help. The stigma surrounding mental health disorders acts as a barrier to those who need help. They’re afraid to talk to their doctor (been there), they’re afraid to reach out to their support network of friends and family when they’re suffering (know all about it), and they’re just generally afraid of being labelled as crazy or defective (yup and yup). Getting outside of my own head is my planned first step towards trying to make a tiny difference in the world. After this I have plans to do something bigger. Reach out to more people in a way that I’m not too clear on yet. I’m not too sure how or when. I have no solid plan, no timeline, and about a million excuses about why I can’t do these things. And in case you’re wondering if I realize that I’m having anxiety about anxiety, you bet I do. But I also know that there are people out there that need to know that they’re not alone. A journey of a million steps starts with the first — so here it is. Anybody who really knows me won’t be surprised by my diagnosis with GAD. My life has always included a base level of stress -a fear of returning phone calls, throwing up before exams and presentations, holding back tears on a busy day, and isolating myself however I could because I felt the safest when I was alone. The worst part of all of this is I thought these kinds of things were normal. I had no idea other people weren’t living this way. I’ve always needed some kind of help but I couldn’t seek it because I didn’t know I had a problem. That all changed after my first panic attack. It was February 6th, 2011 — I know this because it was Super Bowl Sunday. Green Bay was playing Pittsburgh and instead of watching the game I was in my car, in a Wal-Mart parking lot, with my head between my knees, wondering if I was going to die. Panic attacks will always be horrible, and when you’re having one it will always feel like the worst you’ve ever had, but none have come close to scaring me like that first one did. I wondered if my heart would explode, if my lungs would stop working, or if I would ever have the use of my legs again. My mind kept telling me over and over that this was my new normal state. I would never stop feeling this way. My brain had gone crazy and my body had betrayed me –I was terrified. Of course it didn’t last forever. But what it did do was scare me enough to seek help. I went to exactly one session with a drop-in therapist at a Mental Health Walk-In Clinic. This was the first time anybody had suggested to me that I may have an anxiety disorder. I knew that she was right but admitting there could be something wrong with me was more frightening than all of the panic attacks I could ever have. I felt like if I accepted the diagnosis and admitted to myself that I had a problem that meant I was defective (and crazy, and different, and unlovable). So I did what a lot of other people in my situation do — I pushed the thought out of my head and continued on with my life. The panic attacks continued and I started to pay more attention to what I felt like every day. I realized that my feeling of impending doom and incredibly high stress level never seemed to go away. I moved to New York when I got the chance not because it was the unbelievable adventure most people thought it was, but because I knew that in a city of nine million people I could be small enough to almost not exist. I made a few great friends in my time there, but mostly I would work and come back to be alone in my apartment where I felt safe. Every day wasn’t much more than a countdown to when I was finally asleep — this is the only time I had a reprieve from my anxiety. I knew that I needed help and found a therapist that I saw once a week for the better part of a year. I accepted that I had a problem with anxiety and with that came the intense self-hatred. I worked with my therapist but never made much headway. My breakthrough came when I had moved back home and ended up with an amazing doctor who actually listened, understood, and empathized with what I was going through. We started me on medication (Lexapro and Welbutrin) and almost instantly my life changed. It was like I went from black and white to color. If my brain was the RPM gauge on a car my whole life I had been in the red without even knowing it. I lived every single day with my brain being pushed to its limits. And now suddenly the needle had dropped to a respectable level. I finally realized how differently I was living compared to most other people. My quality of life has increased more than I ever could have hoped. My relationships are stronger, I am better at my job, and honestly life isn’t so scary any more. I still deal with my anxiety and I always will. It will never go away. But with the help of my doctors and a great therapist I have it under control. And maybe best of all, I’ve realized that I’m not broken or unlovable. I’m just a guy who has a brain chemistry issue that can be dealt with the same way any other health issue can. And that’s really the point of this whole post. I dealt with such intense negative feelings my entire life. First because I thought they were normal, and then because of the shame I felt when I understood they weren’t. I think back to all the wasted time I’ve had stolen from me. I remember all of the horrible things I would say to myself. I look back on all of the opportunities I’ve wasted because I immediately jumped to the worst possible outcome of what could happen. And it all could have been mitigated if there were more people who were speaking up. If I had understood that mental health issues are just as important as physical health issues. If society didn’t stigmatize mental health as something to keep quiet about or to automatically treat with such disdain. I could have gotten help so much sooner if I had read a post just like this one. I’ve come to realize that I’m just a person like everyone else. I have a great job, a loving family, and a network of people I truly care about — oh yeah, and I also have anxiety. But it doesn’t define me. I want people to understand that mental health issues are nothing to be ashamed of. They aren’t meant to only be discussed in whispers. If you have an issue you can and should seek help. You are not any less of a person because you have a health issue. So please, if you’ve made it this far, take just a second and consider how you frame issues like anxiety and depression in your mind. And then think of a person like me, a regular guy who you could know and maybe even like a bit who is afflicted by one of these disorders. I’m not horrible, lazy, or useless. I’m the guy you grew up with, worked with, or caught a beer with at some point. I’m simply a regular person and so is everyone else with a mental health issue. And if you think you have a mental health problem — please seek help. There is nothing to be ashamed of and nothing inherently wrong with you as a person. Talk to your doctor, call a mental health hotline, find a mental health professional, or talk to the important and understanding people in your life. Don’t suffer alone and in silence. There is a better life out here for you. So there it is, my first step towards helping others. Obviously this is just a tiny diatribe, but to me it’s more than that. It finally allowed me to say out loud what I should have been talking about for years now. The first step has been taken — now only a million more to go. Thanks for reading. Much love. Derek",2017
Mental Illness and its Glamorisation,"Depression. Anxiety. Bipolar disorder. Anorexia. These words have became subjects of everyday conversation, hyperbole or even humour. Wether you’ve heard it on the news or in passing conversation, everyone will be familiar with these terms; a massive development from even just a few years ago. But at what point does accepting and creating awareness of mental health issues become glamorisation and a plethora of false cases? I am a massive advocate of mental health awareness. I have observed mental illness in many forms, in more than a few people I know. But, only in the past couple of years have I truly been able to reflect on my memories and think “so that was depression” or “that’s what anxiety looks like”. When I was younger, and less awake, I saw sadness in its truest form displayed through outbursts of anger, lack of motivation, jealousy and paranoia. I saw anxiety through over exaggeration, exhibitions of fear and social awkwardness. But did I understand it? No, and how could I? No one had told me that depression would affect those close to me. No one explained that the fear and the paranoia that I thought was crazy and even annoying was a deeply rooted anxiety issue that had to be treated with care. Today, the once taboo subject of mental illness has surfaced well above the water. Talking is encouraged, and empathy is paramount. The media, the Internet and general word of mouth has created a revelation of people knowing how to recognise the signs, how to treat those who’s mind is fragile, and critically: how to understand.But what are the implications? The past two years have stood out to me as years where I and the majority of people I know have been affected in some shape or form by mental health. Think to yourself, do you know someone suffering? The answer is probably yes. In response, the past two years have also been flooded with people opening up about their experiences, and I believe social media has become a platform for people to educate one another and converse about the subject freely without judgement, which is both promising and inspiring. Of course, we are still miles away from mental health being taken seriously on all levels. I still hope for the day that treatment for mental illness is considered as vital and important as treatment for a virus or a life threatening disease. Yet we are headed in the right direction and people are beginning to acknowledge it.I can’t help but be agitated however, by the adverse effect of such awareness: the increasing trend of mental health issues as a “look” or a “vibe”. As someone who has suffered strongly from anxiety for over a year, I am not one to be personally offended when someone tweets “this exam is giving me anxiety”. I can appreciate that “anxious” is an adjective to describe a feeling, and people are not necessarily claiming to have anxiety disorder when they use it as a figure of speech (I think this is important for people to understand, let’s pick our battles, there’s too many other things to be offended about!). However, what is alarming, is watching groups of people glamourise mental illness, almost making it part of their aesthetic. In a sense it’s almost became fashionable to have depression or anxiety, it’s part of the teenage angst vibe that millennials are latching on to. People are trying to resemble their favourite troubled TV characters (Effy from Skins, anyone?). Tumblr is flooded with images promoting being in love with your sadness, glorifying self harm and generally making depression and anxiety appear as the norm. I often wonder how many people even truly know the symptoms. I myself simplified anxiety as being nervous or scared. It wasn’t until it riddled my mind personally that I realised there is so much more to it: it’s feeling a bad omen in a perfectly relaxed situation; it’s everyone being out to get you; it’s pins and needles, chest pains, migraines and other physical symptoms that I never even knew would come along with a mental issue. How many people even realise that depression doesn’t always come in the form of sadness, it can just feel entirely empty. When so many people are using mental illness to create a look, how can we pick out who is genuinely suffering? I’ve known people personally who’s illnesses have been completely overlooked and brushed off as just another girl claiming to be depressed, just another girl looking for attention. I can’t help but think that if it wasn’t the norm for people to describe themselves in this way, their cry for help may have stood out and been taken for what it actually was. Yet it blends in to the background of the mass of perfectly content people who want the world to think they’re sad. We are genuinely becoming a more understanding and caring species in so many ways and I hope we keep providing people a platform to open up on. I personally want to be an individual people can confide in. But can’t we be aware without turning it into a fashion statement? Depression, anxiety and other disorders effect those suffering every single day, subtle as it may appear to others. It can manifest itself for no reason, not just in result of a hangover or comedown. It affects your daily activities, relationships with family and friends, motivation, education, your job and so so much more. Can you really equate that to your bad mood because your boyfriend never texts you back? The reality of mental illness is far removed from a fashion statement. There is nothing wrong with having a mental health issue, but anyone experiencing one can testify that there is little beauty to it. I am not trying to dismiss anyone’s case, but simply encouraging that if you truly are a content person, embrace it!! Let’s keep the labels for the people who need them to get the correct help and treatment. One bad day is not depression, and mental illness is not a trend, it’s an illness.

A Hair Story,"I am haunted by that godless 90s hair flip. It keeps me up at night, thinking about how the ends of my hair can flip up and out while the rest of my hair stays straight. Even when I love my hair I hate it. I’ve gotten out from under a pile of blankets, after having turned off all the lights in my bedroom, and left my nightly Netflix binge to go straighten my newly cut hair so I can accurately judge the damage. The anxiety of it all was just too much. Have I ever even liked a haircut? The answer is unclear. After I’ve straightened my newly shortened hair I can decide which parts I need to take the scissor to, in order to right all the wrongs my hair has caused me. Then I can sleep soundly while my brain ruminates on the cathartic, but most likely horrifying, trim I will give myself in the morning. I’ll fix it and probably make it worse, but at least I know what I’m dealing with now. After I’ve done my share with my Dad’s old hair scissors, I am less than pleased. I’m not displeased, but I’m definitely not happy about the newest notches in this stuff that grows out of my head. It is somehow better and worse. The part where I get to contribute to my own haircut is extremely satisfying, but the result is less ‘just slept in’ cool and more ‘I let my four year old cousin go to town on my hair’. Two days of panic attacks and a few more snips here and there, and I find myself sitting in the chair of the stylist who cut my hair when I was a child. A cool twenty minutes later and I’m watching my new haircut air dry while my mom gets her roots colored. We took one car to be more environmentally conscious. I already feel more like myself.",2017
Uncontrollable Stress #3,"I can’t control the decisions my wife makes, my children make, or my colleagues make. No matter how hard I try, they are ultimately responsible for their decisions. I am not responsible for them. I also cannot control them. Sure, I may have some level of influence over them or I may believe I have influence over them, but the less intimate our relationship (and in the case of family, the older they are), the less influence I probably have over them. So it doesn’t help for me to try to control them, or to fret over what they will do, or to obsess over their decisions. None of those things change what the other person will decide. What I can control is how I respond to the situation that arises from their decision. What I can control is how I relate to them regardless of their decision. I cannot control another person’s decisions. But I can control my own behaviour.",2017
Campfire of the mind.,"Let’s play the piano together. You and I. You sit here, and I sit next to you. I’ll start with a long F. You with a quick hit at the E. I want to hold this key down for a minute, if that’s alright with you. It sounds so nice. Have you hit the D# key yet? Don’t bother. Just leave me now. The F key and I are having so much fun.

What it’s like to lose yourself…,"I’d always known I would change and become, different than who I was. I never knew I would look back at a life that I could no longer recognize. A whole other person I feel like I never really new or got a chance to love. I spent too much time on who I would become, that I lost who I was altogether. My last year of college was so different than anything I’ve felt before. I found myself in a daze. A daze that has lasted about a year and a half. I dont remember hours, days, weeks, and some months. September 2016. I remember the beginning of the month and the very end. I spent most of my days sleeping, and I was half-asleep the rest of the time. It was like I was sleepwalking and I couldnt wake up or snap out of it. I’d go the bathroom and I ate maybe a couple bites of something, but that was it. My body wouldnt do anything I wanted it to. No, I wasn’t drinking or doing any drugs, other than my prescriptions. I’m normally a depressed, young adult female; but this was something so much worse. I couldnt do my job, I had no money, and I was losing my grip on everything. Everything was out of control. My mind had betrayed me long ago, and suddenly my body was betraying me. In October of 2016 I applied for Ontario Works (a.k.a. Welfare). To be completely honest, it felt like defeat. I felt like I failed. I was so far in debt that I could no longer see any way out. I was two months behind in rent, my phone had been cut off since August, loans, and a credit card bill that feels like there’s no end. I was drowning; in debt, anxiety, depression, and I felt like a failure. I felt like everything I had worked for and towards had been undone. With everything I lost, I gained something. Some were not so great; anxiety, borderline personality disorder, more debt, and more isolation. Some are good and I know that, but it does take a while to accept the ever changing aspects that I can’t seem to control. I gained a new perspective on everything, I started appreciating the smaller amount of everything I have now, and it is troubling to me that I have become someone I don’t fully understand, anymore. I don’t quite know how to trust myself, as I feel like we just met. For 22 years, I did nothing but pick myself apart, hurt myself, and hurt everyone I loved. I made so many mistakes that I never forgave myself for. It hurts me that I don’t know how to forgive myself. The girl I once was will never know how truly sorry I am for letting her slip away. I failed myself, I chose to treat myself like I was nothing. I saw nothing special about myself, I felt less than ordinary. Then, I decided I would become nothing. I don’t know how to be the old me, I don’t even know her. I am not her, anymore.",2017
The Worry Tree,"Recognise thoughts as thoughts that don’t have to be wrestled with or take you downstream into a sea of worry and rumination. Easily said then done but a good way of working it is The Worry Tree method. Often advised by cognitive behavioural therapists, it is a simple first step you can take to feel more empowered and in control in managing distressing thoughts. Simple, clear and methodical, the worry tree has been used in therapy for years, often in pictural format to try and make the very process of dealing with challenging thoughts simple, clear and methodical. Is the worrying thought something you can actually do something about? Or are they just wasted hours of overthinking? It’s cruel that overthinking is an instinctive reaction to trying to battle a way out of feeling negatively about the original thought, as often it just compounds negative feeling and makes stress worse. Therefore, back to the original question, is it something you can do something about in a practical, methodical way using a to do list process or is it unchangeable? If it’s the later, trying to ground yourself in the moment using your breath and your senses is the first step and then use try and let the thought pass without engaging in it by engaging in something else more positive which encourages outward thinking; a walk, run, chat, movie, music. The more you feel you have managed not to get sucked into vicious cycles of rumination the more your feel a sense of discipline with oneself and the stronger and resilient you feel to managing intrusive negative thoughts. www.getselfhelp.co.uk",2017
Something Something Clouds,"Almost every person gets those days where you don’t know exactly when it started. It might have been at 7:20 this morning when the alarm went off, or the day before, because technically you didn’t sleep that much during your “allowed” sleeping time last night. For me, it sometimes feels like my day has been lasting for days, weeks and even months. ‘Know what I mean? I was trying to figure out a great topic to write about for a blog post, but the void inside my head was unbearable. Therefore; I decided to write about exactly that. The Void. The Numbness. The Fog. The Clouds. I should call it what it is: The Anxiety-Depression merry-go-round. Having General Anxiety Disorder comes hand-in-hand with feeling depressed, it’s the crash after the storm. It fills me up with self-doubt about pretty much every single thing in my life, even the things I logically know are great and stable things. I’ve come to find out that what I doubt the most are my emotions in every way. Am I aloud to feel this? Do I deserve to feel like this? Would anyone understand? But I am setting myself up for failure: only asking questions that could be answered by no (in my mind anyways). When I start to notice that trend, I ask myself more primitive questions that might be answered by no as well: Am I on fire right now? No. Am I starving right now (literally, to the literal point)? No. Am I in danger of dying at this very second? No, well not that I know of for sure anyways. Then, it’s not as bad. Life continues, the day will come to an end, every second is a chance to make a step in the positive direction. Unfortunately, the number of times that I’ve asked myself if I’m on fire is a bit higher that I would like to admit. One of my best coping mechanism is what I am currently doing. Writing. I’m not a writer by any means, but putting down in words what I am feeling makes me process what I am feeling deep on the inside. I can also come back to it later and read it to mourn the feelings that were brewing in me and put them to rest for now. I say for now, because this melancholy seems to come and go. Knowing that I survived through it multiple times, gives me a bit of courage for the next episode. Talking to someone with an open mind also helps. I need someone to listen-only most of the time. Even if I am an extremely emotional person, I still have very good logic. So when I am trying to talk about my feelings to someone, chances are, all the “easy-fixes” you’re mentioning to me, I’ve heard before or thought of those fixes myself in the past. And it may come across condescending to me when you try to “fix” me. I need ears and a heart. That is all. That simple. I’ve been to the psychologist, it was honestly the best thing I could have ever done for myself. My first attempt at a therapist didn’t go as well as I had hoped, it was just not a good match between the two of us. It happens all the time that people are mismatched. After my first sessions, I found myself fearing Fear, which made me even more anxious than ever. I was afraid of being afraid, which is not really a good thing when you have an anxious personality. But it was by no means a reason to give up on myself, because we should never do such a thing, in my opinion. So I went and met with a different psychologist. She was the greatest and to this day, I could never thank her enough. I was able to graduate from college, which at one point, I thought would/could never happen from being so lost in my anxiety and depression. She made me realize where my anxiety was coming from; therefore, I could talk myself through my panic attacks most of the time. Tah-dahhhh!!! The end of the article is approaching and I already feel somewhat better. I often feel silly for my inner thoughts, but that’s just the stigma of mental health making me doubt the reality of my own mental health. I have to remember to eat well, stay active and not to bottle up my feelings to a point of no return. Keep your head up and face the day the best way you can. Be grateful for the people around you and be grateful towards yourself. You deserve it, you really do.",2017
“I’m fine”,"Should – in my opinion, be banned as a response to anything. Especially when it comes to matters of depression or anxiety. I’m not about to start lecturing anyone about their depression, let me be clear; I’m still trying to define how I deal with my own(eight years after first being diagnosed with Bipolar). Let’s say that ‘fine’ is a lightish grey on the scale, a scale that goes all the way up to Vantablack. Even if I’m middling-out somewhere close to black I’ll say ‘I’m fine’. It’s easy to hide behind, right? But lately I’ve been questioning how detrimental it is to deflect how you’re really feeling. To project grey when you’re really at Vantablack. See it as ‘applying a filter’ to how you really feel. In my experience this has just delayed the inevitable. Which brings me to the role various social medias play. The bridging of the gap between what’s happening and what’s actually happening. Social media. It’s always there, waving to you in the background making sure it gives you a jab every so often to remind you that you need to compete — worse; you need to lie. Pop on those rose tinted specs, go after those likes, that elusive dopamine hit every time someone presses that little heart or thumbs up. It provides reassurance in two forms: There are good points and bad points to both of these — I’m not against creating a front per-say. Protecting yourself can be a good thing. But I question its longevity. This weekend I have in fact done the very thing this post is about. An experiment? No not quite, I was on a dopamine hunt myself. We all do it. (This post comes at an incredibly tough time for me and I’m pushing myself to be outwardly trying to get back on track.) Whichever reason from the two above that drives you. At any given time, it might even be both. The main thing that I’ve found is that no matter what the reason it only works in the short term. Long term, it is unsustainable. You end up placing so much pressure on yourself to keep the facade up that you start spiralling and not asking for help. Or worse; you ask for help and isn’t taken seriously because of your aforementioned social media activity. You’ll get sucked fully into the void. You’re draining precious energy scrolling through your camera roll or google or Twitter feed to find a suitable shade of grey to lighten the black. Something funny or a good photo where you’re smiling to pass it off as the present, anything that looks normal. Press share. The dopamine kicks in and you put off the inevitable “Oh I’m fine”. OK. We’ve established that putting things off is potentially dangerous. If you fall too far in to the Twitter trap you might not make it out. All the while, pressure building to portray yourself in the right way. So what do you do? How do you break the cycle? it’s easy to say “care less” etcetera but it’s not really a solution, you’ll crave the dopamine, the attention. You’ll want to keep that wall of safety intact. Without being preachy and whatnot here’s some simple mechanisms I’ve honed over the years that help me. Equally importantly — here’s a bit of good advice for people trying to help someone they love through a bad time from Reasons to Stay Alive. It’s pretty bang on if you ask me. Point 3 especially. *disclaimer — sometimes if I’m smiling in a photo it is genuine and happening IRL and I’d like to think that I am capable of a funny tweet now and again.",2017
Memories in color,"Growth is the seasons: predictable, in theory. Progress is how you lose your footing going up the stairs: still forward, but undeniably messy. I am a Jerah in progress. “This is what my room looks like on a week that my anxiety is particularly bad.” I indirectly apologized, offering an excuse for the tangles of sheets and the sea of laundry flooding against each wall. Usually my room is cleanish, showcasing the masterpiece that is my bed. There are candles lit on the dresser and books crammed in corners. A few pictures of people I used to love, and many of people that I still do hang on my walls. Maybe with last nights pajamas strewn across the chair in the corner. When I’m not okay, stepping inside my room nearly guarantees snapping hangers under your feet and possibly rolling an ankle on a seemingly harmless pile of scrubs and shoes. There are probably 7 empty water bottles on the unoccupied side of my bed and my Vicks rub is most likely on the night stand without its lid. My sister was trying to understand my anxiety, “What sets you off?” It’s different each time. One time I left party early because a table fell over and the loud noise startled me and I couldn’t relax after that. Another time, my young pup’s collar got caught and twisted on a corner and in my panic, I couldn’t cut her free; I screamed and flipped the entire table over and cried for an hour even though she was fine. On two separate occasions, I’ve called the cops because I was home alone and the door bell unexpectedly rang. “It was a hard week, they’re a little more sensitive when I go MIA for hours at a time on weeks like this.” I explained the 13 missed texts and 4 missed phone calls during a movie day. When I start to feel better after weeks like the last, I often will neglect the self care that it requires to continue feeling better. A mistake made by many, I assume. I had a good weekend. “I’m feeling much better.” I said confidently each time I was checked on. I had a lunch date then planned to go shopping with my best friend; I sipped a sweet green tea and roamed aimlessly while waiting for her to arrive at the mall. One moment I was looking at moisturizers and the next my head weighed 4 times as much as my body. There was lightening bouncing off my elbows into my fingertips. I frantically sent an SOS text and bumped into the shoulders of strangers that had no faces. I walked in a circle 3 times before I made a call. I was only inhaling. “Hi my friend!” He answered cheerfully.“I need you to tell me that I cannot sit down on the floor in the middle of this mall.” I choked. He knew exactly what was happening.“Okay, baby. Why don’t you find a bench? Is anyone with you?”“THEY’RE ALL FULL. No, I’m alone.” I yelled in panic, not frustration. The sharp pains in my back and blurred vision fed my fear. “I can’t remember where I parked my car.” I admitted through streaming tears, still clenching onto the cup as it sweat in my hand. I made it to a parking lot. Not my parking lot, but there were less people and the air was fresh, cold, grounding. The rain filled my little black flats and soaked my frizzy curls. “Tell me what you’re looking at.”“There’s a taxi. The yellow kind. The tree is still is mostly green.”“Thats so nice. Nothing is green here anymore.” He said softly. I remember the walk to my car through colors. He talked about his dress socks, which were blue with green umbrellas. He talked about blood, which is red. And my jeep, which is silver. I finally found my car. It was 3 parking lots over. There are signs that I’m far less okay than I think. Sometimes I stop answering questions; I meet each inquiry with silence. The skin on my finger tips will shed and peel from me tapping. My legs will ache from the tension, or maybe from the pacing and fidgeting. “Do you wanna talk about it?” A boy asked as his hand ran up and down my back. I said no, but after a moment of silence, I recounted the panic from 6 hours prior. “What do you think triggered it?” He asked in a whisper. I readjusted my head on his chest with no intention of answering. His arms tightened around me and I could breathe a little bit easier. I still feel sensitive today. My hands are still unsteady and my heart rate is easily spiked. And, I suppose that is okay because the thing about growth is you have to start over after each winter, but with progress you can stand up exactly where you left yourself and take the next step. A step forward, however messy.",2017
The Worst of Times,"I wrote my darkest and sometimes ridiculous thoughts and lists and such in a lovely paper journal while I was incapacitated by fatigue, nausea and crippling anxiety, but I wonder if I didn’t do it enough. I used to write a lot more than I do now, and my family, friends, and therapists are telling me to keep up with it, so I’m attempting a blog now. I’m a bit grumpy and low energy (a lovely side effect of my hormone therapy) and not feeling as creative as I would like, so this will serve as an introductory synopsis of my year. As a recap: I was diagnosed with Stage IIA breast cancer in December 2015 after finding a lump in my right breast. After confirming mammogram, ultrasound, needle biopsy, MRI and (completely terrifying) PET scans, it turned out there were two small tumors and lymph node involvement, so my oncologists at Roswell Park Cancer Institute suggested a very intensive, very thorough treatment plan. I didn’t get a second opinion, because I felt that going to an NCI Comprehensive Cancer Center with a research focus was assuredly the best facility with the best specialists in the area. My tumors were estrogen and progesterone-receptor positive, HER2-negative, which is pretty ‘basic’ breast cancer. About 60% of breast cancers fit that bill. I had genetic testing for BRCA 1 and 2, as well as other mutations — and all were negative. In other words, I don’t have the “Angelina Jolie” thing, and my cancer was not apparently hereditary. I got my chemo port installed on January 14, 2016. I had a heart ultrasound before chemo to get a baseline reading — because chemo can damage the heart muscle. Isn’t that just ducky? I started Adriamycin/Cytoxan chemo on January 21, 2016 (for 2 months), and then Taxol chemo for another 2 months. Chemo is the worst. Anxiety sucked. I still have PTSD. I can’t get into that right now. Jarrett had to give me white blood cell boosting shots 2 days after chemo, which made me sicker with flu-like symptoms than the chemo would have on its own. I developed a herpes infection (yes, HERPES) in my esophagus (YES, my ESOPHAGUS!) during chemo that made me basically unable to eat solid food for 2–3 weeks; I had to take antiviral medication 5 times a day for 2 months. I got an infected cut in my ankle that required antibiotics, to which I developed an allergic reaction, and ended up spending a night in the hospital for monitoring. I finished chemo in late April 2016, had my right boob and 7 lymph nodes removed on May 19, 2016. Following chemo, they discovered in surgery that there were still traces of cancer in 3 of the nodes, which made radiation even more important for me. I had a tissue expander put in at the time of my surgery, which was pumped up with a needle and a tiny magnetic valve over 5 weeks (this had to be finished before I started radiation). An odd thing happened following surgery: my pathology report only noted one biopsy clip removed — even though I had two biopsied tumors — so I ended up needing an extra mammogram prior to radiation- which was inconclusive. Also, my white blood cell counts remained quite low since chemo and so I had to have weekly blood tests during radiation to make sure nothing was dropping scarily low. I did physical therapy for upper body strength for about 3 months. I had radiation in July-August 2016 — which I tolerated fairly well aside from a rough patch at the end spurred on by a reaction to a surgical dressing. My white cells stayed low but didn’t drop any lower during treatment, so I was told it was my “new normal.” I had another heart scan at the end of the summer to make sure my heart was still doing ok after all that treatment (it is). Finally, I started monthly Zoladex shots to shut down my ovaries with daily Arimidex pills in late August. This is “hormonal therapy” to shut down the majority of the estrogen production in my body. Hence, I’m in menopause and won’t be able to have my own children if I wanted to. Risks would be too great. Side effects have gotten worse as the months have passed. I’ll be on that regimen for at least 5 years- probably 10 or more. Since I finished treatment, 3 female cousins on my mom’s side of the family were diagnosed with breast cancer at varying stages, and so I went in for another extensive round of genetic testing — which also came up completely negative. Still no clue as to why I got BC so young. I had a bone density scan to see how I’m doing, considering my hormone drugs can cause osteoporosis. Lovely. I had a 1-year mammogram in December and it was clear. Next up, I have my right boob reconstruction scheduled for March 8, 2017, including a lift and possible liposuction of the left side to match. I’ll continue to have blood work every 3 months and breast MRIs (much more accurate than mammograms for dense boobs like mine) every 6 months. I’ll probably have more physical therapy after my next reconstruction surgery. Whoa. Just writing all this, albeit in digest form, made my head spin a little. I realized this winter that I was going, going, going without barely taking a breath all year- all in the name of surviving. I don’t look like I did a year ago. I certainly don’t feel like the person I “used to be.” In fact, I barely remember who that was. This is exhausting to write about. Cancer is a full time job, and this list above just touches on the physical experience. The social, emotional, spiritual, and several other -al aspects of this mess are complicated and challenging, to say the least. This was my year. This was real. And there’s a lot more to say.",2017
"Die, Anxiety.","It was too loud. Too crowded. Everyone stood too close. My daughter kept racing ahead and I just cannot handle it if she’s not within touching distance. I saw that video where the kid got snatched while the mom stood right there. It ended fine for that woman and her child, but what if…? What if what if? My husband asked me a question. I had to make a decision. A teensy tiny $5 decision. It was too much. I couldn’t decide. But it was so simple. So easy. Why am I so stupid? I wore my coat in. Bad decision. I usually freeze my butt off on the way to and from the car, to and from the store, so I don’t have to deal with the I’m so hot I’m going to die feeling. I hate that feeling. Why did I wear my coat in? I could feel the breath of the guy in line behind us. Dude. Step back. Two steps. That’s all I need. I had to puke. But I didn’t. I was okay. I’m okay I’m okay I’m okay it’s not stressful it’s just Walmart and a phone charger and I’m okay. We got in the car and, except for the shakes, I was fine. So stupid. So frustrating. Calm down, brain. You don’t belong to a cave woman who needs to fight or flee. You belong to me — a woman who just wants to be able to leave the house without feeling like this every time.",2017
Confessions From Someone With Mental Illness,"TW: Self-harm, mental illness, eating disorders. One of my goals for 2017 is being more open and honest about mental health. For me, that means that I’m going to talk and write more honestly about things that I go through on a daily basis- even if those things are embarrassing for me to admit. It’s going to get personal and emotional, if something you read in any of my writings is triggering, please, please, stop reading and take care of you. Triggers are a very real thing that deserve to be respected so I will always put trigger warnings on things when it’s relevant. On the average day the things that I struggle with are: I like to spend my fair share of time on the internet and one thing I’ve noticed lately is that a lot more people are talking about mental illness and trying to stigmatize it and it is so incredibly awesome. I’m so proud of everyone who I’ve seen talk about their illness with such courage and honesty. For real guys, go you. It’s tough. BUT, I’m still seeing a lot of things that romanticize mental illness, self harm, and eating disorders. I want to share some of my experiences with all of the above because it’s not pretty. I don’t want someone to save me or someone to kiss my scars and tell me how much they love me. I want to be authentically me, even if that version of me isn’t “beautiful”. I’m not proud of my experiences with self harm or my eating habits. But, I’m not ashamed anymore. Lately, the combination of anxiety, depression, chronic pain, and very vivid flashbacks of traumatic situations has put me into a huge rut. I have barely been able to get out of bed, on average I’ve been sleeping 10–18 hours a day. My body hurts, I’m completely drained. The only reason I’ve been able to make it to work is because my anxiety keeps telling me that if I call in sick or show up late, I’m going to lose my job and if I lose my job, I will be completely helpless. Anxiety wins that battle every morning. I sleep through about 5 alarms every morning and only get up when my anxiety hits the panic button and I rush around so I can make it out the door in less than 5 minutes. My depression could care less about catching the bus, or making it to work on time, or having friends and good relationships. Don’t even get me started on how little my depression cares for showers. That’s what hats are for, right? While that is my life on a day to day basis, it’s gotten worse in the past week. Not only do I have my regular anxiety vs. depression struggle and random break downs due to flashbacks- I also have come to the realization that self harm is becoming a real thing again for me. I realized that I’ve self harmed since the age of 7, I don’t know how I got into it but it happened and it’s been very much a reality for me. Cutting, burning, hitting, etc. anything I could get my hands on in the moment, happened. I’ve gotten better with keeping it under control but once or twice a year, I can’t anymore and I give in to the overpowering thoughts. Earlier this week was the day that I gave in. I look at my legs with shame and embarrassment. They’re covered in scars and I can remember each excuse I made for every scar that anyone ever saw. I learned to hide them and to lie. I just wanted to feel alive, I didn’t want to die. I wanted to feel. You see, while doing all of these things, I disassociated, it was terrifying and I just needed to feel real again. It became very much an addiction to me, every time I did it, I needed more and it needed to be deeper and worse than the one before. It’s a scary position to be in and the aftermath, sucks. Self harm for me is suddenly panicking about everything while feeling incredibly empty all at once. It’s feeling outside of my body, like I’m watching myself from above and everything is just happening and I have no control over it. It’s feeling alone in a crowded mall,watching everyone moving around you while you just seem to stand there. It’s my anxiety realizing that it’s not in control anymore and needing to find something to remind me that I’m here and I’m alive. Sensations. Blood. The smell of burning flesh. Something. Anything. It’s showers that burn. Seeing old scars and feeling ugly. Clothes that cover. Avoiding beaches, revealing clothes, family, and friends. Lies. It’s lovers who ask questions when they see you naked for the first time with concern in their eyes, for you, for them. Making up excuses. Feeling like a burden. Drowning in guilt. Nothing feels beautiful about it. “In case you didn’t know, dead people don’t bleed. If you can bleed-see it, feel it-then you know you’re alive. It’s irrefutable, undeniable proof. Sometimes I just need a little reminder.” ― Amy Efaw, After Self harm isn’t reasonable. It’s compulsive and intrusive. Being addicted to cutting means hiding sharp objects everywhere. It means taking things apart in a frenzy with shaking hands and teary eyes and naked skin, just so you can calm down for one whole minute. So your brain can just stop. It’s finally admitting what you’ve done to your best friend and having them spend the rest of the night worrying about your well-being. Or, having them drop everything they’re doing to pick you up and take you to get bandages and help you cleaning your wounds even though it’s midnight on a work day and feeling like a burden and inconvenience. It’s when you’re having a bad day at work and end up having a panic attack in the bathroom and all you know is cutting. It’s crawling across the dirty floor hoping- praying that there is a broken shard of glass somewhere hiding in a corner so you can just relax. It’s compulsive and intrusive. I just want it to stop so, I give in. If there’s one thing I could tell anyone who is considering self harming for the first time is: don’t. Please don’t. Call a friend and ask about their day. Have a really cold shower. Go for a walk. Find an alternative to help you out when you feel like this. Build a support net. It’s so hard in the moment but I promise you, it’s so much better than the alternative. Related Resources:Some distraction techniques can be found here.

How anxiety affects people around you,"A lot of people think that anxiety isn’t a thing and that the individual who claims they have it is making it up…But it is actually recognized as a psychological “disorder”. It is a serious matter that can damage an individual psychologically. It can impact their everyday life; at home, work, even social life! At home it can be developed over time or it just happens. When it develops over time it is based off how much pressure the individual feels is put on him/her by his/hers parents. In this case the individual doesn’t feel “safe” or comfortable enough to say what they feel or what problems he/she has. It feels like they will be laughed at, judged maybe even hated for their feelings and fears… Lots of thought and fear goes through the mind of such an individual and it is very hard for him/her to express it. Some days they feel the need to be with their parents, others they just want to be left alone. It isn’t easy for them to feel like they need to impress their parents. They try their hardest not to disappoint them. And when that happens all they want to do is runaway, cry and never come back. They fear living at home and disappointing the most important people in the world to them. In the case of it just happening would appear “strange” to the parents or even friends hence the fact, that the individual has never had an anxiety break down before and never shown signs of it. Also causing the loss of friends in some cases… It is sudden but is triggered by something; constantly rejected by people in their lives and not feeling good enough. It is also sudden because the individual is holding the feeling of rejection inside of them and putting it way back into their heart so they don’t get hurt and then the simple act of rejection on the other side triggers the anxiety and the individual just freezes, tears start pouring down their eyes… There is also an individual who know he/she has anxiety but never lets it show. This kind of person knows how to control the anxiety but can also sometimes come with stronger waves hence the fact that he/she is pushing it away and then it comes back like an explosion of a grenade. At work anxiety works a different way. But it does have one common thing and that is making the individual not feel good enough. That he/she is the worst employee they have and often makes him/her work really hard. But sometimes the individual can’t concentrate on their work, all he/she thinks about is that there are a lot of people around him/her and that everyone is watching him/her. There is a lot of fear towards communicating with his/hers coworkers and when the communication is happening he/she feels uncomfortable. Looking everyone else but the coworker’s eyes. In social life the anxiety can be the strongest. The individual is avoiding every kind of eye contact. Especially at school where he/she is looking down or pretending to read a book whilst he/she is walking in the hallway even avoiding people and friends. In class he/she will sit all the way in the back desk looking down at the desk hoping no one will come talk with them. But there can be another case when the individual is afraid to speak to someone first so he/she is hoping that someone will come talk to them and when his/her friend chooses someone else than the individual feels rejected but he/she knows that the friend likes him/her yet still feel rejected and not good enough of a friend. Also grades can play a big role in anxiety. The individual is nervous while writing the test because of the fear of failing it even though he/she studied hard and knows everything and this fear often makes them somehow ruin their test and he/she gets a worse grade than what he/she deserves. And that grade gives anxiety a bigger strength. It makes the individual panick! Short breathes, heart beating fast, can’t talk is frozen in place. Some individuals learn how to control this attack but others don’t know how to. Which can cause laughter of childish classmates that don’t take these things seriously and think it would be fun to film it and show it to the whole school. There are understanding people who will stand up for the individual's attacks and fearful behavior. It is a big factor in not trusting people. The individual has been hurt by so many people; bullying, backstabbing, etc. So when a new person shows up in his/her life the individual might seam extremely quiet and distant at first. Real friends will stay patient and wait until he/she feel comfortable enough and trust the person enough to open up to them. But there are people who spread awful rumors about the individual just because he/she wasn’t open enough to them. And that doesn’t help them at all and only makes things worse. As an adult not studying, anxiety can be in a form like the individual not liking to go shop because he/she would need to come face to face with the cashier and that makes him/her extremely uncomfortable. With family he/she seems distant as well and it makes the family go against him/her because they don’t try to understand what is going on in his/her head. (There are understanding families). And also the feeling of being rejected here comes in a romantic matter. He/she doesn’t want to feel alone hence the fact that they were alone most of his/her life due to the anxiety… The individual wants to feel love and feel loved but if afraid that the loved one won’t love then back and leave them forever. And this also comes with very extreme trust issues. And because of those issues it is really hard for the loved one to get the individual opened up. This can cause the loved one lots of inpatients which causes leaving him/her. Or lots of patience and love which helps the individual’s self confidence and anxiety. In elderly it is less common. But as every stage of life comes with fear of rejection. But in this case it’s rejection of their children and grandchildren. These days lots of families fall apart too easily… So it makes them free losing communication with their children leading to their grandchildren. Also it can be caused by fear of being laughed at by people, etc. (I don’t want to repeat myself too much). In general anxiety can also cause the individual hating people in general and avoiding big crowds of people. Public transportation makes him/her feel uncomfortable as well; someone sitting next to them causes him/her to squish themselves as close to the window as he/she can. Makes the individual seriously nervous to get out the bus or metro when it is very crowded. He/she doesn’t like it when he/she catches someone watching them… There are many different severities of anxiety and each of the severities cause different reactions and feelings. It is a really serious matter and is getting more common. It can be due to the pressure of today’s society and social media. If anyone was showing at least something from what I have written please be patient with them. They need your patients. Don’t just burst out mad at them that makes it worse for them and might make them fear you! It needs to be taken seriously, responsibly and with a lot of patience.",2017
How to Healthfully Manage Post-Election Anxiety (vs. overeating and drinking).,"I myself am still sifting through the outcome, and what it has revealed. The truth can be hard. Painful. Difficult. Truth often feels like a death and not an Oprah ah-ha moment. And, there is tremendous value in a clear diagnosis. Metaphorically, it was a win for the continuation of an imbalanced, patriarchal archetype. This pattern is the root, root cause of physical and emotional dis-ease. When a society is built on hyper-masculine values, we devalue the feminine qualities of emotions, the body, nature and intuition. It’s why we’ve normalized an industrial food supply, where we dismiss nature’s power with pesticides, chemicals and preservatives designed for profit growth, not health. These imbalanced patriarchal ideas trickle down into all of our systems, including health-care. That is why we incorporate war into medicine. To fight a battle when our bodies present symptoms — from cravings to weight gain to depression. We assume the body is the enemy, rather than trying to understand this discomfort more intuitively as a symptom asking for our attention. No one wins in this dynamic, as evidence of the U.S.’s dismal health experiences, despite the fact that we throw more money into health (or weight loss) than any other country on Earth. My own healing quest from cancer, depression, and Irritable Bowel Syndrome revealed a rigged health-care system that disenfranchised me in multiple ways. It turns out it wasn’t what the media and traditional nutrition textbooks were teaching. It’s what they left out. The voices they silenced and maligned. I discovered how people in power, business people who valued profits more than human welfare, were rigging our health-care system (for as little as $50,000! No huge conspiracy theories needed). This includes a lazy and unimaginative Corporate and political agenda that claims jobs and a clean environment are at odds. Or we need industrial means to feed us (40% of food in the U.S. goes to waste). Yet while learning inconvenient truths, I also learned wondrous possibilities. That we didn’t have to accept a diagnosis as fate. That health wasn’t about deprivation but being full of delicious food, emotional power and deeply rewarding relationships and work. I became so passionate about this idea of health that I spent the next eight years consistently working 7 days a week for 12 hours a day to be able to contribute to a new medical paradigm that’s arising. None of this was easy. I wanted to quit plenty of times. There were deaths of many ways I wanted to see myself and the world. Yet, as a result, I felt powerful and savvy enough to work around this malignancy in our society. I love supporting others who are doing the same. This of course is minus the Russian roulette (literally now, thanks Putin!) we are all playing, given the blatant disregard for our environment. But now, months out from the election, seeing the domination of the masculine archetype over the feminine, I feel eerily back to that place when I was diagnosed with cancer. A life or death uncertainty about the life and values I hold most dear. Some say this is the death of democracy. Some in the spiritual realms are saying an old story is dying and a new, more integrated feminine story is rising. That a Hillary victory would have continued the illusion of progress. That electing the Donald helps us clearly see what we need to address. Me? I believe the meaning of this turning point is yet to be determined. Having walked the long and winding path myself and in coaching my clients, is that everything doesn’t necessarily happen for a reason. One of the main reasons I got cancer was from pesticide exposure due to poor environmental regulation. Not quite the neat little “love and light” answer the self-help industry loves to sell. Why some of my clients have lost siblings and parents to cancer or car accidents or been sexually abused cannot be neatly wrapped up, bow on top. This is the difficult truth. However, we do have the power, based on our experiences, to decide what each of our heart-breaking experiences will mean to us. This is how we heal and come out more in love and appreciative of life. As Maya Angelou said, “Have enough courage to trust love one more time and always on more time.” Switching careers to develop a health coaching philosophy is deeply rooted in my wanting others to have agency in their health and in the care of their bodies. My work transformed me from feeling like a victim of cancer. The emotional transformation required to be a successful entrepreneur saved my life as much as what I eat. It’s not easy to make new meaning out of the past or the current unfolding of life. It might be the most challenging work you do in this life. But it will save your life. The one that is here, now. Regardless of how you voted, the number one health priority we all need to make is to ask, “What will a Trump presidency mean for you?” For me, I want it to signify an “extinction burst” of a hyper-masculine war on life. Extinction burst, as defined by behavioral psychologists, is an increase in some behavior prior to its extinction. This often happens to my clients right before they fully heal an emotional wound that keeps them in the all or nothing healthy eating pattern: they will totally overeat or go on a binge. If they don’t overreact, such as going on a cleanse or restricting themselves, and use the tools they’ve learned to heal the emotional “flare-up”, their healthy eating consistently improves dramatically and permanently. For this election to mean extinction burst, I’m becoming more involved in environmental and health-care/women’s rights. The power isn’t in positive thinking or dismissing how people are feeling. It’s in listening, learning and better, more informed action. I see many people galvanized from the clarity this election has offered. This is critical because most of our systems are unhealthy like our health-care system. We need all of us, healthy and engaged, to heal them. And I need to remember, and maybe the reminder will help you also. I discovered the best version of myself when the chips were highly disorganized and overwhelming. And, that progress is rarely linear. As I look at the patterns of history and the eerie parallels between the downfalls of other great societies, the one X-factor different from other historical turning points is that women have never been as influential in society as they are now. We have our own resources, independent of our families or husbands, for the first time in (recent) history. This means we have plenty of groups, men included, who already deeply respect the feminine archetype. We will all have to come to value the feminine qualities to work towards creative, nurturing, and intuitive solutions. This will be our obstacle and path. Are you in?",2017
Letter for the Broken Ones,,2017
The state of the nation is bad for my health.,"And this isn’t even a piece about the ACA. This is about me. More specifically, this is about my mental illness. I live with generalized anxiety disorder. I do not handle scary well. In most cases, I can choose to avoid the sorts of things that trigger my anxiety. I don’t watch horror movies. I never have gone to one of those Halloween haunted houses (and I never will). I don’t look up illnesses on the internet. Here’s why: My brain is hard-wired to react from a place of fear. On my good days, I’m replacing my fear-based thoughts with positive ones. I’m expecting the best. I’m mindful. On my bad days, I am convinced there is an ominous shoe about to drop, and I have to be on guard every moment. Yes, I’m getting treatment. I regularly see a therapist. I take medication, I practice EMDR. I advocate for myself. It still exists, though. For example: Sometime last year, I saw a stand-up set (public service announcement?) Rosie O’Donnell did about surviving a heart attack. She emphasized that women have different warning signs. She talked about how lucky she was. She said the type of heart attack she had was dubbed by doctors as “the widow-maker.” I wish I had never seen it. Because now, if I have indigestion, or a sore neck, or a headache two days in a row, I assume I’m going to have a heart attack. And I assume I won’t be as lucky as Rosie O’Donnell. Note: Rational me totally understands this makes no sense. Rational me understands there are actionable skills I can utilize. The part impacted by anxiety feeds on fear, though, and doesn’t care if it makes sense or not. It tells me I’m a lost cause. It puts me in mental paralysis. This leads me to where we are now. A scary man is about to be put in office. THIS WEEK. He terrifies me. And I don’t mean his politics, either. I mean him, specifically. He is a bully. He is cruel and hurtful. He is disrespectful. And he is everywhere. Much like you wouldn’t stick a person going through chemo into a room full of sick people, you wouldn’t force a person with severe anxiety to follow the news — be it real or fake. It’s all terrifying. The news has the potential to make sick people sicker. And I can’t even bring myself to think about what he’s (not) going to do for those of us in America living with mental illness. As much as I want to turn this into a funny ha-ha kind of thing, I’m not going to, because that’s stigmatizing. My fear is legitimate. It’s real to me. His hate scares me, and the hate he cultivates around him scares me. If there is a safe place to get news, please direct me to it. I don’t need to hear about golden showers. I don’t need to hear about who he has insulted this time. I don’t need that much negative energy from a person in that high of a position of authority raining down anxiety upon our heads. Clue me in when he’s done work. When action has been taken. I don’t need a Pollyanna approach. I realize I can’t pretend bad things aren’t happening all the time. Our country exists with a predominant negativity bias. I get that. If there has been negative action taken, like, bills passing that I disagree with, or legitimate threats from other countries, or stuff that has directly resulted from his lack of respect for his position, I need to know. What I don’t need to hear is what might happen. What he (or his cabinet) has done or said that could potentially lead to something bad. That’s where my brain starts filling in the worst blanks. We need to make the news safe for people like me, and others who live with disorders such as PTSD, depression, or trauma due to sexual assault. I don’t know how that happens when he is on the precipice of being put into office. I just don’t. More support groups. More concern for our fellow man. More patience and understanding. More psychiatric beds (looking at you, Colorado). More compassion. More advocacy. More awareness. More love.",2017
Coming apart at the seams: the struggles that inspired Channel D’s latest album,"Life-changing anxiety has long been an unwelcome presence for singer-songwriter Nick de Grunwald (whose songs appear under the name Channel D), like a ghost in a shadowy corner. A period of panic attacks and insomnia for him began with the death of his mother and the World Trade Center attacks in New York. It lasted some fifteen years. Whilst his debut, Mosaic of Disarray drew on these events, but also general anxiety about the world, especially the conflict in the Middle East, the follow-up, Unravelling, is a much more personal work. It is also much darker, with one or the other of its fundamental themes of anxiety and depression running through all the songs. How did the album come into being, I ask? He answers that it began with a terrible time in his life when he felt he was coming apart at the seams in 2014. “My partner, who is bipolar (but perfectly well ninety-nine per cent of the time), started behaving strangely while we were staying in France. Broken nights, she couldn’t sleep, kept saying really strange things. It’s so hard to explain,” says Nick. “It’s very alarming and scary: you are thrown on your own resources. There isn’t a book that tells you what to do, so you’re on your own.” He recalls the difficulties of finding medical help there and trying to change their flights home, which caused quite some suffering. Then he phoned her psychiatrist, who said bring her home, I’ll be ready. “It all sounds easy in hindsight, but when you’re with someone going manic, on the high end of the bipolar spectrum, it is not easy. You have to watch, as if she was a baby, that she doesn’t harm herself or do something strange. I managed to get a flight a day and a half later, so waiting those hours, packing up everything on my own, seemed quite exhausting. Then getting her to the airport and on the flight, feeling worried sick all the time that she’d disgrace herself by behaving badly, was very very stressful. The journey back seemed as long as returning from Australia, but we made it.” He had to take her to hospital and leave her there. “I’ve done it twice before, but I feel that I’m abandoning her so I felt very very sad driving back alone.” The guilt he felt is painfully clear from his words and in songs on Unravelling such as Derelict. “When I got home I realised I was shaking, and it scared me. I started feeling incredibly emotional and kept feeling that way on and off all the time. I couldn’t answer the telephone or ring anyone, I felt so shaky. It took about eighteen months for me to recover enough to function, not jump a mile if the phone rang, not feel fearful of everything.” We move onto the first song, Birds When Disturbed, about the sense of loneliness and otherworldliness peculiar to the night. The brooding, slow-burning song, with its echoes of early Sparklehorse and the soundtracks of David Lynch, arose from his feelings when selling the house that had become a sanctuary for him. “It’s the only place ever in my whole life where I totally fell in love with a house. It was beautiful, high on a hillside in southwest France, looking over the valley, across to the horizon. I am still mourning not being there, it was important to me, like a true love.” I feel his sense of loss at the thought of losing this oasis of beauty and peace with the unique charm of the French landscape. Nick wrote Birds When Disturbed the night before they had to leave. “I couldn’t sleep, I was sitting by the old fireplace, embers glowing, only a log or two left. I had an eerie feeling, I was in quite a highly-charged emotional state, not wanting to say goodbye. It was as if there was a death, and my senses were heightened. I thought birds might be singing even though it was the early hours of the morning.” That sounds a bit like a scene from a horror film, as does the incident that inspired the album as a whole, so perhaps it’s not surprising that one of the songs, Panic, sounds something like a horror-film score. Its electronic-sounding drumbeat, electric guitar and almost ghostly synthesiser chords evoke a breathless, nightmarish anxiety. It conveys the sense of isolation and claustrophobia of someone suffering unbearable stress while having to go through the motions of everyday life. What was the immediate, conscious, starting point for this song? “I had just had lunch in Central London with a BBC Commissioning Editor, and at the very end of the meal I felt very strange, like I was going to choke. I couldn’t breathe. I didn’t know what to do, I tried taking deep breaths, sitting down, so I decided I should get back to where my car was asap, because I’d be getting a parking fine — it sounds ridiculous in hindsight, what’s a parking fine compared to a full panic attack? But I had it in my head to just get to the safety of my car and then I could get home. “The journey from Central London to where I’d parked the car was complicated, and I had to change trains twice, and it involved me going down and down further and further into the depths of the Central Line. I felt I was descending into hell, I couldn’t breathe, my head was spinning, but I couldn’t stop, I had to go on — and the people on the escalators seemed horrific, like in a film. Some seemed to be staring at me, some I thought had no eyes at all. I felt I was hallucinating. Then eventually I got on the train and it became a lot worse. “The train seemed crowded and hot. I felt I couldn’t breathe and that I was going to die for sure. I remember wondering if people in the carriage all had their own problems — strange thought — but maybe this pain, feeling about to die, is the human condition. I knew I couldn’t look at them: I was afraid to as I felt in such extreme anxiety. “When I got off the train, I still was feeling anxious about whether I’d get a parking ticket (yes I did) but I stopped somewhere quiet and tried to make myself be sick. I was pouring with sweat but eventually, through attempting this, the panic attack evaporated. I was going to live. I was totally exhausted and started crying; I felt I was going to fall over I was so light-headed and dizzy.” From anxiety we move onto the other main theme, depression. I say that, to my mind, New Year’s Eve is the most haunting and beautiful song of the album — and one of the saddest. What is his response to people who say the words should have something, no matter how small, to relieve their unrelenting grimness, something to give his listeners some hope? “Writing this song was like therapy. I wrote it on the day, knowing everyone talks about going out and partying and seeing the New Year in. Every time I’ve done that, it feels so empty to me and, if you stay in, you get joviality of an incredibly false kind (it seems to me). I was at home, the rain was coming through the roof and I felt desolate. “I wish I were different and were like everyone else. I just wonder are there other people like me out there?” Nick tells me that for him the key songs in this album are Unravelling (the title track); Stumbling, which is “all about anxiety and the catastrophizing thoughts that go on in the middle of the night; every sound is alarming if you’re in a heightened state of fear”; and “The End of Love[, which] is about how to live without hope — and love.” He adds “I feel like I am a spider endlessly, like in the Myth of Sisyphus, travelling up and down, not knowing what I’m doing.” But, for someone who doesn’t know what he’s doing, he’s done very well in recent years: helping his partner through an extremely difficult time, come through a terrifying panic attack and turned it all into an album of beautiful, achingly poignant, songs in his trademark mix of country music, mainstream-with-a-twist and nightmarish synthesisers. www.channeldmusic.com",2017
How to help your child with anxiety,"Children can feel anxiety for different reasons. Seeing your child anxious can be anxiety provoking for many parents. Best way to help your child when they are feeling anxious is to try to stay calm and be a safe person they can talk to and feel heard. When children learn how to handle anxiety at a younger age, they are more able to cope with anxiety as an adult. Below are some techniques to teach your child how to best deal with their anxiety. Anxiety comes from feeling a lack of control. Helping your child feel more connected to their emotions and knowing how to best manage those emotions will help them feel less anxious. It is normal for all children to feel anxious. As a parent the the best thing you can do is let them know they are normal and be there for them as a space space to listen. If you do that alone you can help them. If you feel your child’s anxiety is something that is overwhelming for both of you, seeing a child therapist can be helpful. A therapist can work with both of you to come up with a plan that helps your child feel more content and in control of their emotions.

Stop Watching What Others Are Doing… To Compare Yourself,"As I thought about the post, I found myself wondering how often we look to others for what we should or should not be doing. I believe two potentially dangerous things happen when we compare ourselves to others. When we focus on other people’s wiper speed, we risk judging ourselves and judging others. Judging Ourselves Comparing ourselves to others is a dangerous thing to do. It is a flawed process that rarely leaves us in a good position. When we measure ourselves up against someone else, we most often compare our liabilities to their assets. Think about this for a minute! When we look to others to measure how well we are doing, we are looking at their outsides. This is all we can see. So, we look at their appearance, their clothes, their muscles, their speech, their behavior, and more. We also may look at their possessions and all the things they have accumulated. Then, we take that information and compare ourselves and what we have and are to that outward measure. However, we cannot help but add what we know about our ‘insides’ to the equation. So, we compare only what we outwardly observe in others to what we are inward and outward. This is not a fair comparison. I remember counseling with a friend as she told me about how inadequate and frustrated and overwhelmed she was. As part of her story, she began to tell me about another friend of ours who she wanted to be more like. She told me how much she admired her because she was so this and so that. She was saying her wiper blades were not moving at the right speed, and this other woman had it figured all out. Imagine my experience just a week later being in the home of that other woman. Her house was a mess, her hair was frazzled, and she vented about how hard her life was and how she was struggling to keep it together. Then, she did the most interesting thing. She brought up the first woman. What did she do? She admired and praised her while she delivered lashing to herself. She believed her wipers were moving at the wrong speed, and the first woman had it all right. What an ironic and instructive experience for me. I learned dramatically how painful we can make it for ourselves when we compare ourselves to others. It is rarely ever fair or rational to us or them. It hardly ever results in a positive feeling or self-improvement. Comparing our wiper speed to others rarely results in good and reliable data or feelings.

Anxiety + Music,"“One cannot grow when one no longer participates in life” — Dr. Henry Cloud There is a sense of urgency that plagues our culture and our music industry. We are trained to think about the past (memories) and the future (thought). We are rarely told to be present, to accept where we are, and have a relationship with life and all it offers. We are rarely told to participate in life, what is right in front us. For me, anxiety is living in a state of past and future. I have a tendency to live in past hurt or so called “golden years” and the “what if’s” of the future…. and believe me, I really know how to go down the rabbit hole and then find another rabbit hole within it… The amount of times I have predict the future correctly, 0. The amount of times I have been able to travel back in time to be in the past, 0. The only thing that matters is being present and moving forward in life. The universe is going forward and it is our job to move right along side it.. not get ahead of it nor drag our feet about it. In the music industry there is a never ending cycle of highs and lows, completing a project, feeling like your on the mountain top only to wake up the next day to have to prove yourself again. You are vulnerable, open for the world to judge. The thing you have spent months on gets praised or cut down within seconds. This can create some serious underlying moods in the mind and body. For a long time I had this cycle that follows…. Hoping to get work, get the work, doubt comes in….. can I do this work, can I make something sound great again, what if I can’t make it sound like the last project (living in past)…. all of a sudden what I was dying to get (work) has plagued me with doubt and anxiety. Tell the fear and anxiety to shut up… do the work… Work is done, send to client…. small voice comes in, hope they like it, what if they don’t like it, what if they tell people I suck, dropped the ball, here comes doubt, fear, and anxiety….. (living in the future) Client loves it, I feel incredible for 10 min. Close out the project and then find myself at the bottom of the mountain or worse yet just the list of mountains to hopefully find myself with the opportunity to climb one again (living and worrying about future). Can you relate? My worth and value is not determined by others approval. It is determined on whether or not I was true to the project, the artist, the client, myself. Did I give it my best for where I am currently, fully understanding that in one month I will hopefully be in a better place in all areas of my life. Was I honest and present for the project? or Was I lost in past projects (memories) or thinking about future projects (thought). The music industry is a perfect place for anxiety to live and grab hold of people. You have to be fully honest and tell stories of your life in song form and then let the whole world give praise or throw stones, or even worst… no one listens to it. No praise or stones… just silence and isolation. We focus on social media likes and comments, blog features, managers, A&R, labels, publishers, and the noise continues. All these things are good if you have a healthy relationship with them. But for me its hard. Its a daily training of recognizing that these things do not determine my life or worth. They may impact it, but I have control over choosing what to do with them. I’ve learned over the years to find confidence and find that where I am and the work I am doing is good. It is correct. Where ever you are, is where you are. You can’t go back to a project and you can’t predict the future. You can only focus on what is right in front of you. I have made improvements in being present and having a better relationship with anxiety by…… mediation (headspace app). laying out my day. Going to counseling and understanding that these emotions, fears, anxiety are all apart of life and learning to live along side them is the most healthy thing. I become fully present by admitting that I have hopes, dreams, desires, and needs as well as boundaries. I focus on being aware of whats around me, how I feel, and I no longer let things alarm me. Aware, but not alarmed. I slow down. I start saying thank you for what I have and had to stop asking how and why. I make sure I am eating food… studio guys know what I am talking about…its so easy to go hours and hours without moving. This wrecks your mind and body. I put in the freaking work and trust the process. If you don’t hear anything else… all of this is garbage unless you put in the work and make a change. Approach things differently. Find some people you can trust knowing they will still fail. The hardest thing in the world for me is trusting the process. These things have helped me immensely navigate the waters of life and anxiety. I urge you today to just focus on one thing at a time. To understand that who you are is who you are suppose to be. I will say it again. I need you to be you. I want you to be yourself and be present in your relationships with others. If your in the music industry, I want you to celebrate where you are and celebrate your friends around you. I urge you to embrace life and surrender where you are. I want to encourage you that we live in a world where we can make change and grow. I am living testimony to that. If you have any wisdom or tips, feel free to comment. May you never stop growing.",2017
Chapter 1: The Beginning.,"Every story has a beginning.. as well as an ending. I don’t know what is harder.. the fact that every thing in the universe has to line up perfectly in order to start a chain which will lead to the birth of each life, human and animal alike; or the inevitable knowing in the back of your mind, that this life will end, as well as every life around it.. No particular person was made, nor taken, without divine destiny. I have always lived my life in the shadow of misfortune. I have colleagues who would even suggest, that I am perhaps one of the most unlucky people they have ever met. This does nothing to shatter my ego. I have known this for most of my life. I, however, have agreed with this statement, and have on occassion, worn it as a badge. Like the saying goes; “Be who you are, and be proud of it,” or something like that.. And though I haven’t purposely done so, I believe I have created some of the adversity in my life. Most know about my tribulations in life, but not a lot know about the internal battles that consume me everyday. The depression, anxiety, PTSD, social disorders that I try to hide from the general public. When the secrets that lie in my mind have been exposed to the people around me, it is almost as if they can not accept that I, for a moment in time, am not the person I have portrayed before. That suddenly, I am someone that they have never met. The happiness, the silliness, the almost adolescent aurora that has been me from the moment we met, is gone, and quite possibly, never existed. That is how extreme the other side of my psyche is. When I have a panic attack, it is not a minuscule lapse of time. It is significant. It is very apparent. It is a noisy, dramatic, embarrassing, horrendous, miserable occurrence. I am so introvert after the fact, that I will become a recluse from periods of time that have others wondering if I will ever resurface. I haven’t always been like this.. In fact, I was once happy. I used to only see the good in people. I used to “roll with the punches,” per se. Now, it seems as if I break a nail, I need a mini-vacation from my life. Some days are better than others. Some days, I don’t get anxious at all. As in, I’m too depressed to be anxious. Even a good day will be ridden with anxiety, some times depression. Depressed at the fact that people I love can not enjoy this with me. Depressed that this good day, though is nice while it exists, will soon be gone, just like I and everyone I have ever met. I have a small voice in the back of my head that can ruin a perfectly good day.. “How dare you have fun. How dare you act like all of this is not going to be taken from you tomorrow. How dare you smile when your loves ones have died. How dare you laugh when people suffer all over the world. How dare you.” This voice has convinced me that I do not deserve the simple pleasures someone else does. I do not deserve a great life. That somewhere in my soul, I have convinced myself that I do not deserve anything of value, or anything of substance. I don’t know if I believe in reincarnation.. or if some where in my psyche, I have locked up a memory from myself. Something that I still punish myself for to this day. I have done that before. I have unlocked a corner of my mind before, something that my mind had hidden from me, and it made me hate myself more. You see, for many years my mind has been protecting itself from me. It knows that the real me, the one that has been manuvered deep in my mind with many closed doors, shall stay behind these closed doors, to ensure the safety of what sanity I still possess. Many suggest medication. I have tried psych-medication, yet never prescribed to me by a professional, unless you consider second-hand information from the actual possessors of the prescription. The only true medication I have tried that seems to work is Xanax. Go figure. In a world of millions of diseases, prescriptions, and billions of people; I, in fact, need one of the most abused prescriptions in the book just to feel normal. Unfortunately, this pill does not cure me completely. I have tried to tackle my insomnia with everything from NyQuil and Melatonin to the infamous drug that contributed to the death of Heath Ledger, Ambian. Of course, when I dabbled with the pharmaceutical, the side effects were not fully known, and I was given the drug to test from a Supervisor at my place of employment at the time. Both of which, will remain unknown. The result: 2 hours of sleep, and two days of none. You may be asking yourself why the title of this chapter is called “The Beginning” if all I continue to do, is talk about me in the Present. Well.. I am more or less hoping the reveal more of my past, as this entry continues. I am hoping that the state of being I am in currently, will be my beginning. That I can make a new me, and all of these mental issues will be my past. I am also hoping, that none of this is just wishful thinking. This is just one chapter in a series to come, that will document my life as I feel during my progression towards some type of normalsy.",2017
Uncontrollable Stress #4,"You and I really aren’t cows and we’re certainly not cow oracles. If you’re anything like me, and you may be nothing like me, you often find yourself thinking about tomorrow. Thinking about next year. Thinking about … or fretting over. Ruminating might be a good word. A ruminating human is like a cow chewing cud. In fact a cow is classified as a ‘ruminant’. They regurgitate food they’ve already swallowed and redigest it. It’s already been chewed. Then they chew it again. The difference between a cow and a human is that the cow can get more goodness from ruminating the food. We don’t get much goodness from ruminating the future. After all, how can we know what the future will hold? How can we process what hasn’t happened yet? So if you fret about the future, it may be helpful to realise that the future is an unknown and an Uncontrollable. Some may argue only you can control your future. I much prefer to say that only you can control your present. Now is the time you live in and now is the time you control. You’re invited to stop ruminating over what hasn’t happened yet and start exploring how you can control this moment now, the moment that’s unfolding before your very eyes.",2017
Turning fear into rocket fuel,"Fear is something I’ve experience all my life, often on a daily basis. Someone once told me that fear is innate in all of us. It’s an animal instinct, designed to protect us when we were roaming in the wild among predators that posed a serious threat to our lives. That fear of what’s around the corner is what has helped humans outsmart bigger, deadlier creatures and survive through the ages. Most of us are lucky enough to live in a much safer environment today, but the natural urge to be scared remains within us. One of the things to bear in mind about fears is that they rarely materialize in the way we expect them to. The true knocks in life come seemingly out of no-where. The fears that plague our minds on a daily basis are often unfounded — or only serve to undermine our confidence. I’m talking about the fears at work and home. Am I a disappointment to my family? Does my boss hate me? Is my boyfriend going to dump me? Will I end up old, lonely and poor? These are questions that emotionally cripple us — and no matter how long we mull over them, we’re unlikely to change the outcome. That requires a change in mindset, fueled by a positive, not a negative vision of the future. Some people mistakenly believe that fear is a powerful motivator for change. In fact, it’s not the fear that’s driving the change in behavior, but the hope for a better life. Fear is like a cage that wraps itself around us and holds us prisoner to our circumstances. Hope is the key that opens the door to a better future. One way to overcome a fear is to address it head-on. Let’s assume the worst case scenario actually happens (and as I just said, they often do not). Let’s use an example that you get dumped by your partner. Then what? Would you go back to being single? Yes. Would you have to move into a smaller place? Possibly. Would it make things awkward with mutual friends? It’s a possibility. Would life end? No. When you make a list of these kinds of outcomes, you soon realize that most of the firm certainties in this scenario aren’t all that dramatic, nor are many of them a certainty. For instance, you don’t know how your friends would handle a break-up. In your catastrophic thinking, you might be tempted to believe that all your mutual friends will disown you, when reality usually provides a more pleasant, supportive outcome. We haven’t even address all the wonderful, exciting positive things that can occur after a break-up. You get to make a fresh start, go out and meet new people. You are free to do as you please and see who you please. Think about your life as a singleton. Was it really so bad? You might prefer life in a relationship, but don’t mistake that preference for an all-or-nothing way of thinking. As Winston Churchill, the former Prime Minister of Britain once said, failing to plan is planning to fail. So look at every fear you have, break-them down and and if it warrants a plan of action (a plan B as it were), then do one. Then if the worst should happen, you’re prepared. Another thing to point out is that sometimes, a bit of fear is good. It’s closely linked to excitement. There’s a reason why theme parks are such big business and thrill experiences in general. Halloween is an international celebration of all things scary! In a world of comfort and security, people need to feel pushed out of their comfort zone every now and then. The boner killer to fear is safety and as we all know, too much safety, whether it’s wrapping your child in cotton wool or always taking the soft, easy option — isn’t the best approach on life. It can leave us bored, unfulfilled and full of contempt for the comfortable, unchallenging world around us. People spend a lot of money trying to incite fear in themselves in a controlled way. Boot camp style fitness programs work so well for people in powerful positions because for once in their day, they are scared of infuriating someone who is tasked with controlling them. So not all fear is bad. In fact fear can be a a lot of fun, so long as you push through it. Fear is that first date, starting a new job, going around the world and immersing yourself in a new culture with nothing but a backpack. Fear is taking yourself out of your comfort zone and throwing caution to the wind. But can often disable us and leave us too terrified to do anything — that’s when fear is a huge negative in our lives. Don’t let fear control you. Let it fuel hope inside you. That’s when you turn fear into rocket fuel. But whatever you do, don’t stick your head in the sand and ignore them. All fears, ALL of them, require action. So next time you feel scared — firstly look at what it is that you’re fearing. If it’s a true threat to your life, your health, your finances, your career, then arm yourself with hope and come up with a plan of action to tackle it. But on closer inspection, if that fear is just a butterfly feeling in your stomach because you’re not sure what’s around the corner, then simply give it up to fate and accept that you cannot control everything in your life. Do what you can. Give the rest up to the universe and ride the wave.",2017
Stop Worrying About the Future — Do These 3 Things Instead,"I often find myself worrying about the future. Instead of being present and enjoying what I’m doing in the moment, I’m thinking ahead, trying to predict what will happen next. I worry about the economy collapsing, my clients firing me, my girlfriend dumping me, and about a hundred other things. However, I, like most humans, am not great at predicting the future. Our predictions about the future are commonly inaccurate — even when we use complex models and detailed research reports. This reminds me that the worries about the future in my brain usually have almost no basis in reality. So instead of worrying, I save my energy for betting things. Here’s what I do to stop worrying… Have confidence that things will work out in your favor. Have confidence in your ability to handle adversity. Since it’s nearly impossible to accurately predict the future, we may as well lean towards positivity. Thinking positively may actually help you perform better and therefore avoid whatever you’re worried about. Even if things don’t go perfectly to plan, you will have learned and grown stronger from the experience. In addition, per hedonic adaption theory, our happiness levels tend to return to equilibrium after both wins and losses. A few weeks after getting a raise, we start wanting more. A few weeks after restricting our diets, we don’t hate vegetables as much. Knowing that you can adapt is a reason to stop worrying about the future and start focusing on taking action to improve in the present. Accept life as it comes. Regardless of what happens in the future, make the best of it. Take it one step at a time. Take action now. Take action tomorrow. Small improvements every day.

‘Introvert’ or Coward?,"Actually, I didn’t do something. Here’s the story: I was bowling with some friends, and another group of friends arrived at the bowling alley. These are people with whom I’ve been close in the past. Based on the good times we’ve shared and the randomness of the encounter, these are people who I should have been excited to see; an eventful turn of events on an otherwise uneventful evening. One of them, who had been living away from our hometown for some time, noticed me and walked over to say hi and catch up. We talked for a moment and then it was my turn to bowl, so he politely returned to the group. Basic social etiquette and the logistics of the situation would dictate that, following my turn, I should go say hi to the rest of the group rather than having the entire group come to me. But I didn’t say hi. Pulsing with anxiety, I remained rigid where I stood. For that brief period I became the archetypal socially anxious person: absorbed in my worries, unsure of what to say, too scared of the potential for awkwardness to make my approach. After an uncomfortable hour of trying not to acknowledge their presence while simultaneously bothering myself to go say hi, I finally glanced over to see that their time had expired and they were gone. A rather mundane, borderline-pointless story, I know. However, I couldn’t stop thinking about the incident. I couldn’t stop thinking about how I felt, how I failed to act. During that time at the bowling alley, on my drive home, in bed that night, and for much of the next day, all I could think was: “what the [bleep] is wrong with me?” Am I so detached from my youth, from the good times that we shared? Has the increased solitude and routine of my young adult life dulled my personality so much that a friendly encounter is now a strenuous test of will? I’m introverted, that’s the problem. Actually, that’s not it. The problem is I know I’m introverted. I’ve started using it as a crutch, as I suspect most self-proclaimed introverts often do. We forget that introversion is a state of energy-creation and not a social disposition. We tell ourselves that our introversion is a deficiency which impedes our ability to have successful social encounters. When we tell ourselves this, our introversion becomes a built-in excuse for any situation in which we don’t make the appropriate effort to be present-minded and available to others. Our introversion becomes selfishness, feeling that we are entitled to reserve a disproportionate amount of our time, attention, and space. Our introversion becomes rudeness, viewing interactions with others as cumbersome and a burden. Our introversion becomes cowardice, retracting from others out of the irrational fear that the interaction might result in disaster. As one of my (extremely) extroverted friends assured me, these things happen to everybody. The other night at the bowling alley, I wasn’t an introvert. I was selfish, I was rude, and I was a coward. I don’t ever want to be that person again.",2017
There is no going “through”: Recovery from invisible injuries,"At the end of December, I took a running leap at the driveway (thanks, dog) and landed on the right side of my face. At first I didn’t think anything of it; it was the second time within a few months that I’d fallen on my head/face, and third significant fall in a decade. But I always bounced back, so what was the big deal? It wasn’t until a month or two later I started to understand what a big deal this was. At least it was a big deal to me, and how I function in my world. My neurologist says I have post-concussion syndrome and has me going through cognitive remedial therapy, physical therapy, and I’m seeing a psychiatrist and therapist regularly. So I’m taking steps to get better — even though we have no idea what being better will be. He was honest with me: it’s going to take me a year or two to fully recover, but I’ll never be who I was pre-fall. Whatever that means. The problem is, right hemisphere damage can affect attention, perception, learning and memory, reasoning and problem solving, awareness, and orientation. As a student, editor, writer, and horseback rider — as well as generally clumsy heroine trope of a human being — recovering from this fall has been . . . Frustrating. Defeating. Challenging. Heartbreaking. Every day off I have to take I feel that I’m just giving in to the idea that my generation is the worst generation, that I am nothing more than a lazy millennial. I’m going back and forth with my psychiatrist on trying to find something that combats the depression and anxiety but, really, I’m looking for a magic cure that will help me focus, that will help me go back to working all day, every day. Why? Because I’m a strong, independent woman and I’m not going to depend on other people to take care of me. I can do this all myself. (I can’t.) (I shouldn’t have to.) On the other hand, I’ve never felt better. When I edit manuscripts, I see plot holes and patterns easier, as well as other nuances in developmental editing. I’m more honest, with my clients and myself. I’m more honest in my writing. When I have the energy to, I can hustle hard, be outgoing, be active on social media. When I look up at the sky at night, I see constellations I couldn’t find before. So there are positives, there is light, there is hope that this post-fall me is going to be someone better. It’s hard to see that when I have to look my deficiencies in the face, when I can’t get out of bed, or I’m on the couch binge-watching my latest comfort show. It’s hard when I have to take a break from school because I can’t comprehend the assignments, or I go to read an academic paper or book and can’t understand. I look normal. I look like any other brunette-turned-blonde twenty-something. You can’t see my scars on my knees, because I hate wearing shorts. You can’t see the way my brain is running too slow when someone is trying to teach me something new. You can’t see the way I try and listen to every conversation, every noise, in a room I’m in and the panic that it causes. You can’t see my anger and frustration — my anxiety — that comes with this injury. Because I don’t let you see it. But I’m working on that.",2017
"What OCD & Anxiety Have Taught Me about Fear, Hope, and Inner Strength","I lovingly joke that I hate it when people toss off “Oh, I’m so OCD” about this or that. It honestly doesn’t bother me too much because I know that’s part of their experience, but I do hope my experience might illuminate a more nuanced idea of mental health broadly and Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder in particular. Every day with OCD is a mini battle. Lately, it feels like my body and mind are at war, but I am hopeful that I will come through this battle, if a little wounded. At its root, Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder is a form of anxiety disorder. OCD is basically a personalized set of mostly irrational obsessions that may or may not correspond to several compulsions, which are powerful, many times paralyzing physical urges to perform an action. My main obsessions are bodily symmetry and fear of death/harm to me and my loved ones. When I have compulsions, if I try to resist, it feels like a wave of electricity going through my body that clouds my vision and impedes me from thinking about anything else. So I have to do something to relieve that stress. And if I can’t, panic sets in. My parents have carried me to the ER because I literally thought I was having a heart attack. (Crazy, right? I was 18!) As a young lad growing up in western Kentucky, I remember I was very particular about symmetry. As I learned to tie my shoes, I could never get both feet to feel the same, to feel right. I’d refuse to tie my own shoes many times and make my parents do it, releasing myself of the responsibility to find symmetry. That, or I’d wear slip-on shoes. In elementary school, I remember my mom would send me to school with a plastic food container of lotion because I would wash my hands so much that they would be chapped and bleeding. I became more self-aware in middle school. I can recall repeatedly tracing back over things I wrote because it didn’t feel right when I wrote it the first time. I would find pressure points in my body that would release some of the the physical urges I felt to repeat things — the most effective were the back of my tongue against my top molars or my thumb nail against the hinge of my pinky finger. Like many teenagers, I loved watching horror movies and hearing ghost stories, but sometimes those scenes stuck with me, and I went through periods where I couldn’t go to bed before checking every conceivable place an intruder might hide — under my bed, behind the doors, the closet, behind the recliner — and that all the doors had been locked, probably 5 or so times, not just to make sure (clearly it was locked), but also until it felt right. I realized I count, a lot. Anything that’s repeated is bound to be counted. And there’s hardly anything that isn’t repeated. Luckily, I don’t realize I’m counting most of the time, but I do consciously avoid certain numbers. You know, the usual strings of 6s and the occasional 13. I do a lot of modular counting—4 reps makes 1 set, 4 sets make a nice square (squares are comforting and solid). I figured out in high school that routines could help make life easier. Instead of putting on deodorant until it magically felt right after upwards of 52 swipes per side, I finally settled on a nice number for my morning grooming routines — 5 swipes on each side, 8 swirls at each of 24 “stations” when brushing my teeth, 4 at each “station” when washing in the shower, and so on and so forth. Reading has always been difficult, too. I love it, but it’s difficult. When you have to sync your in-and-out breathing rhythms with the sentences you’re reading, it can become drudgery (gotta watch out for run-ons). I know these are not the most glamorous of details, but I felt kind of crazy until I met someone in college who did amazingly similar things, and I realized I wasn’t alone. My parents are awesome. I owe so much to them. They are peaceful and loving and supportive. Even when they don’t understand me. By the time I was about 13, I had put a name to what I was feeling — OCD. My dad, who grew up in rural Mississippi in the 70s, when mental health wasn’t so widely understood or talked about, advised me (and I’m paraphrasing), “Everyone has their quirks, and you just have to learn to deal with it.” These were probably the most important words of my life. His words emboldened me to always be a fighter, to seek ways of handling my problems, to be my greatest advocate. Don’t get me wrong, support is crucial. I don’t think I would be sane today had my parents not relentlessly questioned the ER doctors when I started having panic attacks in college or come lie by me to ease my fears of dying in my sleep so I could drift off for a few hours. Later, a dear professor who taught me to meditate and going through Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) helped tremendously. Mental health struggles are nothing to be ashamed of. Like my dad said, we all have our quirks, and we are strong enough to handle them, but we all could use a support system of family, friends, and professionals, who want us to be healthy and happy. OCD has taught me that fear is mostly irrational. Sure, fear is a helpful, built-in tool that is necessary for survival, but many times we give it too much fuel and carry it far past its rational limits. And with OCD, many compulsions are arbitrarily based on nonsense superstition, like “Don’t go that way around the fire hydrant, go this way because if not, you might get hit by a train or your family might be hit by a tornado.” It’s like chaos theory on steroids. (I’m convinced superstitions were invented by someone with OCD.) But I’ve also learned to handle the fear. Fear and anxiety are only as powerful as I let them be. I have the choice to feed them. If I don’t feed them, they will starve. I choose what to feed my thoughts. I can choose hope and uplifting diversion, or I can feed them fear and doubt. For instance, periodically throughout the day, I’ll see flashes of myself being hit by a train or a bus or hear the words “Last Day.” So, taking inspiration from the song “No Day But Today” from the musical RENT, I know that I can’t control whether it is or is not my last day. I can only control my response to these fearful stimuli — am I going to let it paralyze me, or am I going to do my best to enjoy my life? I’ve come to release that responsibility and counter these thoughts, either with a quick prayer; a few moments of focus on slow, intentional breathing; or simply with the word — “Life.” I slow down, I look around me, and I take a moment to appreciate where I’m at, what I have, who I am. And I continue moving forward. The seasons change and bring new compulsions, new battles. This one is particularly tough, wherein I feel trapped inside a body that is always tense and beaten up from the barrage of compulsions, but I have hope that this too shall pass. I have hope because I know that having hope is the only way to weather the conflict. The important thing is that I know I get to choose. And I choose to keep moving forward. I choose life.",2017

Persistence Works Best With Resistance,"We’ve been taught that persistence is a virtue, and it is. You ought to stick with whatever you choose to do. However, persistence alone does not create mental and emotional growth. Real growth comes from accepting and overcoming your resistance to new challenges and persisting toward your goal anyway. I’m grateful to have had a powerful teacher when I was just 17 years old. He was my first training instructor after I enlisted in the Air Force. About two weeks into basic training, I was exhausted, homesick, and fed up with being yelled at. I requested permission to see the training instructor, whose assignment, incidentally, was the yelling I mentioned above. I went into his office, stood at attention, told him I was not suited for the military life, and I that I wanted out. He took me by surprise when he asked me to sit down and in the kindest voice possible he said, “Rausch, this is the easy part. Going through these next eight weeks will be nothing compared to what you will experience for the rest of your life. You can’t run away because it feels hard. If you run from this you’ll never learn to face the tough things in the future.” His words hit me hard. I knew he was right. If I couldn’t face and overcome some of life’s challenges that create resistance, I would never learn their value. By the way, that was the first and last time he spoke to me in a kind voice.

Awareness promotes ignorance,"I watch a lot of crap on TV — soaps, benefit programmes, Jeremy Kyle. I love these programmes — they help me switch off and, if I am honest, they help me feel better about myself. I know that is pretty vile of me… I was watching Casualty on Saturday and there is a character, David, who has bi-polar. This is a recent revelation in the show. I’m assuming a relapse is coming, as he has confided in another nurse that he is going to reduce his medication. Why am I talking about this? This isn’t real life, it’s just a TV programme. Well, I am not the only one watching these programmes — millions of viewers tune in every day, every week, to these different programmes. These programmes have an effect on the mentality, thinking and awareness of each and every individual watching, including myself. Watching Casualty the other night first made me laugh but, later on, infuriated me. I initially laughed when David took his medication (I do not find the need to take medication funny — keep with me) — his medication bottle simply read ‘lithium’. He took one tiny pill. The ridiculousness of this made me laugh. Later on, in bed, I thought about how mental health, with their treatments, is portrayed. I thought about the awareness of mental health today, in the UK. I thought about how so many more people are talking about mental health. I thought about how people lobby against medication. This made me angry. We are ONLY talking about functional depression and functional anxiety. The individuals in the soaps and other programmes are typically working, keeping their mental health diagnoses a secret. I’m in no way invalidating the experience of those who can work alongside their mental health — that takes stamina, courage and bravery. Lets acknowledge, however, there are different stages of mental health. We seem so scared of offending others that we put all mental health on the same tier, when it’s actually not; in doing what we are currently doing, we are actually invalidating another group of people. Those people who cannot work, who often live in a different reality, who cannot physically get out of bed. There are stages to cancer — stage 1 is not as serious as stage 2, stage 2 is not as serious as stage 3…you see where I’m going. It’s still cancer, just stage 1 is easier to treat. It’s the same with mental health. Mild depression — although horrible — is not as serious as major depressive disorder; major depressive disorder is not as serious as the same disorder but with psychotic features. We are NOT seeing this other group of individuals. We are shown individuals who *should* be happy, who ‘have no reason to be depressed’. I use quotation marks there to ensure my readers know I DO NOT agree with that statement. However, my assumption is that these functional disorders are the only ones being portrayed because that is what the majority can relate to. Individuals in loveless marriages or divorced, shitty jobs, some dependency on the bottle of wine each night. I see articles complaining about the overuse of medication — namely antidepressants. Once upon a time, this was me. Medication was poison, Big Pharma are out to dupe us all and basically, we all need to get a grip and sort ourselves out. The people writing these articles, however — do they have treatment resistant schizophrenia? Or bi-polar with psychotic features? Or such debilitating depression that they can’t get out of bed to go the toilet, let alone turn their computer on to complain about medication? There are no programmes or articles showing these individuals because we don’t want too acknowledge them. We, as a society, do not understand psychosis. People generally do not know that they are psychotic — that’s a massively important distinction. They do not know that the people they see following them are not really there; they do not know the voices are *just* that; there may come a time when they develop enough awareness about their disorder that they recognise when they are becoming unwell and they can raise the alarm, but for many, this is incredibly difficult. Some people do know they are hallucinating. This is different in itself. I am talking about the ones that don’t, the secret mentally ill of our society. The terms ‘depression’ and ‘anxiety’ are flung around as everyday, normalised issues. The words have lost all meaning. Depression can be debilitating. Anxiety can be debilitating. It’s shit so many have depression and/or anxiety, but if you are able to get dressed every day for work, feel pleased, proud and, most of all, relieved, not hurt and invalidated. If you do not want to take medication, great — fantastic. Do NOT slam others for taking medication, however. It’s great you can make that choice, afford therapy, keep going regardless. For some, it’s not even a choice. Individuals are placed on community treatment orders — if they don’t comply with taking medication, then they are hospitalised. That’s how unwell they are. For some, the choice of medication is taking a risk with their life. Clozapine is a highly effective anti-psychotic, usually the last port of call. It’s so dangerous, it can kill if not administered correctly. It has side effects and can reduce life expectancy by 20 years. I can almost hear you screaming at the computer, ‘who takes that shit then?!’. The people who cannot distinguish reality from delusion. The people who believe their partner is trying to kill them, or the people who see ghosts in their house and are terrified. Those people take the medication, because quality of life is preferable over quantity. Bi-polar II, depression and anxiety disorders are fashionable right now. Schizophrenia, psychosis and bi-polar I, are not. Mental health awareness as it stands today is a lie — we are even more ignorant because we think we are aware. Maybe we should go and volunteer at our local MIND centres, or local mental health units and we will have an understanding of the individuals attending. The individuals portrayed through our screens are not the individuals who are hospitalised on a daily basis. People who stop talking mid-sentence, people who dress so bizarrely it makes people stare, people who believe they are related to the Royal Family, people who defecate in their own bed… Maybe we all need to turn off the crappy TV and educate ourselves. We need to REALLY stop the stigma and recognise who has a choice and who has a different choice. I include myself in this.",2017

Anxiety Diary #3: The Lies That Anxiety Tells,"(I wrote these a little while ago. My anxiety is better at the moment, but sometimes it is not so kind. In the times of these deeply anxious rants, I felt diseased by anxiety. I was in pain every day from it. Anxiety is understated, but it is prominent, and I am simply here to share that not one of you is alone in your pain and suffering.) I am feeling…rejected and sad. I am feeling like a nuisance. I am feeling like a bother. I am feeling annoying and it annoys me. I am feeling anxious about all of these feelings. It is overwhelming and I hate it. Even though I know people are there for me, I don’t think they care and I don’t think they notice my struggling. I don’t really, truly think anyone cares to know just exactly how I feel. I don’t think anyone genuinely cares to know or cares to help me. I am just annoying to everyone. I talk too much. I am lonely. I am boring. I might be funny and silly and cute and nerdy, but…I don’t think people admire that really. I don’t think anyone really looks up to me. Is this depression? Feeling absolutely worthless and unwanted? Why is it that people say they want me and love me, but don’t seem to. Am I a crybaby? For some reason no matter how unwanted I feel I still seem to cry out for someone to help me, for someone to want me, for someone to listen to me. I am incapable of keeping my feelings hidden because I want someone to help me. I want someone to love me. I want someone to really want to be around me and not mind me. I don’t want someone who seems to always have an air of impatience towards me. I feel really annoying. I feel like he is annoyed with who I am and how I talk. It makes me not want to talk. What’s wrong? I don’t trust anyone. I don’t want to see anyone. I want to live in solitude. But I’m too scared to give up what I have. I have never been good at keeping to myself. Maybe I should try. Maybe it’s time to lie. I hate lying. I will have more anxiety attacks than ever before and I will have to go through them all alone because I will be stupid enough to lie to the people who probably do care about me. My perception is so distorted I feel so trapped and I feel like no one cares about my voice. So maybe I’ll just be quieter from now on. My promises never stick. They never stick because I am weak. My anxiety says that I am weak, but if I were to give in to the pain and become something that I am not or change drastically and irrationally, that is when I will truly be weak. No one cares and they never will. My problems are too big for anyone to fix, even those who love me most. I can’t help myself by myself but I don’t see any volunteers. I am depressed and no one cares. If I died, people would care, but they don’t even know me. Don’t cry for me you don’t even know who I am. You don’t even know what I’ve been through. You never even bothered to ask. He told me he was always there for me if I ever needed to talk, yet other things–facial expressions, vocal intonation, words he used–told me he didn’t really want to know. Maybe he did, but I’ve always been too scared to call him up at night while he’s sleeping. I have always been too scared to tell him how I really feel or what I’m really thinking because I am scared that he will react. He does not usually give a reaction, but when he does it is random and makes me feel sort of inconvenient. I am anxiety, it is becoming me. It gets worse every day and it makes me so confused. I don’t know if people love me or hate me despite what they’re telling me. I don’t know if I am annoying or I talk too much because no one has told me they just make obvious signs. Like…when I ask please tell meeee!! It makes me more anxious to have to overthink it and assume, just please lay it on me. I am a mess. And I feel…inconvenient and unwanted. Unneeded. Who actually needs me to be whole? Who? Me? I need me? God needs me? Here? It hurts. And it sucks a lot. And there’s no one here but me. Even though I have a boyfriend who loves me and likes to be with me I am unsatisfied. Love was my passion. It is my passion. I want to fulfill my passion of love. I have wasted my whole life on pursuing love. Was it a mistake? Has it been anticlimactic? No, the experiences have been amazing. But they are proving to be not as pleasing as I’d hoped. Love, romance, passion, I may be only 17 but I feel it will never come. I feel old. I feel tired. I feel sad. If anyone read this, they would know who I am. I don’t want people to know. This is one secret I have kept. My thoughts. No one knows what I think and write down. Sometimes I share it with them, sometimes I don’t. I don’t even want me to reread any of these thoughts ever again. They are not to be repeated. They are my secrets and they will forever remain as such, unless I chose to go to a therapist. Which I probably will not. So it is just me and you. April 21, 2016 11pm",2017
Inner Warriors and Alter Egos,"Have you seen that episode of The Mindy Project? The one where Danny is giving Mindy a bit of a hard time. “Danny Castellano Is My Gynecologist”! That was it! (I watch that show way too much) Anyway, after lying on the floor and contemplating her life, (as we all do from time to time), Mindy was given a little pep talk by Morgan who told her to have like a warrior name in order to shield herself, and well, I was thinking, and that’s not actually a bad idea. I mean, think about it. Having an alter ego, a kind of stage name, an inner “warrior”, is that really so crazy? I think it’s inspired. It’s a coping mechanism for the messed up, exhausting, absolutely outrageous event we call life. I, myself have used it many times in real life. Just create an Ideal You and then when times get tough, or a situation becomes too much for you to handle, you can just think about how you would handle it if you were that person. And you know that method will be right because that’s the ideal method, right? Or pretend you’re a book character or a film character. A TV character even. Katniss Everdeen, if you want to be courageous and badass. Scott McCall, if you want to be super sweet and caring. Shrek, if you want to be a green ogre..? Idk. You get the idea. Life is hard. Sometimes we get into challenging situations that can’t be helped. But you can control your behaviour if you get into the right mindset. Okay so here’s the general concept (I’ve altered it slightly):• You have a character, an inner warrior, a spirit animal, an alter ego, whatever it is you choose to call it• You use that persona to keep yourself sane Here are some examples:You feel crazy nervous and anxious? Channel the fiery confidence of Blair Waldorf.Someone tries to make you feel stupid? Erm, no, bitch. I’m Hermione Granger.You’re stuck in a boring family event? Woah, that might’ve been a problem if you weren’t the Queen of Patience and Family Fun Time. I don’t know if this makes me crazy. (I hope not). All I know is it works for me (most of the time). You don’t even have to be a character. Sometimes I just tell myself “hey, I know you have to go talk to those people you’ve never spoken to before, but you can do it. You have that confidence within you. Just tap into it. You’ll be fine.” And when you do it, it feels good, y’know? Like you’ve accomplished something. One small step and all that. So, go ahead. Try it sometime. And let me know if it works. Hope this helps. Also, I’ll be doing other anxiety related posts because it’s something I understand and try to fight on a regular basis. It can feel like the loneliest place sometimes but it’s important to know you’re not alone. If you like this post, please tell me via social media (Tweet, comment below, etc.) because I’d love to know if I helped even in the slightest. And also do feel free to share this post with others whom you feel it may help. Thanks for reading, I’ll see you soon :) x justcallmedee.wixsite.com",2017
5 Realistic Ways to Defeat Anxiety,"The worst kinds of anxieties and fears are the ones we create for ourselves. Awareness is the first step. Learn to be an objective observer of your thoughts so they stop controlling you. Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is a technique that can help you begin to modify negative thoughts and decrease anxiety. The way we breathe is strongly linked to the way we feel. When we are calm we breathe slowly, and when we are anxious we breathe more quickly. Implementing techniques such as relaxed breathing and progressive muscle relaxation can bring you back to the present moment and moderate feelings of anxiousness and panic. Designate a period of time every day where you can let your anxiety run free and rampant. Choose a set time and place for worrying. Make it the same time and location every day and early enough that it won’t make you anxious right before bedtime. During your worry period, you’re allowed to worry about whatever’s on your mind. The rest of the day, however, is a worry-free zone. When we are anxious, we tend to view the world as a scary and threatening place. Our thoughts cause us to react as if there is a real danger which escalates our anxiety. Replacing anxious, negative thinking with realistic thinking is another effective strategy in managing anxiety. Begin to question if your fears are rooted in reality or stemming from faulty thought patterns. Resisting your anxiety only magnifies it. Realizing anxiety is a feeling like any other feeling can help you start to accept it and move past it. Acceptance is important because trying to eliminate it only reinforces the idea it is intolerable. Learning to tolerate uncertainty and discomfort can go a long way to minimizing anxiety in your life. Interested in learning more about these techniques and more?

Do Something Awkward Every Day,"The problem. As a manager of one or a dozen direct reports, it may be once a year, a quarter, or even a week when you need to have that “awkward discussion”. Other events with customers or clients may also generate angst. Some events you may face on a frequent basis which generates a little anxiety include: These events can be difficult for new managers or even veteran ones. My story. I’ve been asked to speak at numerous events on construction topics and I am far from the perfect speaker. I used to walk into these events thinking that everyone was looking at me when I because I was the speaker. I still get that way a bit, but now that I’ve done these events more and more I’ve come to realize most people are at this professional meeting to network and socialize with other like folks. Although they’re expecting to hear your presentation, it’s not the sole reason for their attendance and therefore shouldn’t knock you too far off balance. So, now as I walk into these rooms I tell myself “it’s not about you Scott, you’re just one of the reasons they’re here, take it easy”. Another way I practice maximizing my comfort zone is by providing a small direct compliment to someone, or event some light constructive criticism. A compliment may be on the way someone has their workspace organized or how they deal with a client on the phone. A recent criticism was regarding dishes left in the workplace common area — it’s one thing to leave dishes around at home, but if you’re going to use coffee mugs and plates at work these must be addressed on a daily basis. You can also practice out in the general public. Compliment the barista on the coffee they made, or tell the salesperson at T.J. Maxx that they’re dressed well today. Summary. It sounds silly to do these little things, but if you continue on a regular basis to stay just on the outside of the fringe of your comfort zone, it will be that much easier to address larger and more awkward situations when they occur.",2017
Psychological Graffiti 041,not myself todaytied up in the knot of selfGordian not-self,2017
My anxious journey,"I was 18 and in my first year at University when I started suffering from debilitating anxiety. I changed from being a carefree 18 year old, into an anxious, worried wreck of an 18 year old. It started with a small worry about getting ill, and soon turned into a tidal wave of anxiety and negativity. I had no defence and became obsessive over my health, trying to avoid the worrying thoughts. Obsessing about getting ill achieved one thing. It fed the fear, helping it grow until I was almost certain I was ill or that there was something seriously wrong. I would follow this obsessive pattern, attempting to avoid anxiety and worry for the next 15 years. It took my wife a long time to understand what I was going through, which I think comes down to the way anxiety shifts your perspective. At its core, my anxiety takes things that I’m afraid might happen, comes up with the worst possible outcome and then convinces me that it will happen. In 2016, my anxiety and the obsessive way I try to deal with it hit its peak. But, it was also the year that I managed to take a step back and start to regain some semblance of perspective — it was the year I started to understand what was healthy for my mind and what wasn’t. Here’s how I did it. (I am in no way a doctor or professional health expert. This is just what worked for me). At the beginning of 2016 I started a new project at work. It meant I had to move offices from my Westminster office to Fleet Street. I had commuted to work on my bike but the added miles and busy roads meant I wasn’t keen to continue on the bike. I had cycled to work every day for four years so it took me a while to notice what I had lost. The two hours I spent on my bike gave my mind a break. With nothing to think about other then the road, my mind was free to process the day and rest. Have you ever found you are more at peace in certain environments? The lighting in a room matters. So does working at a tidy desk. The music we listen to can get our hearts pumping or calm our nerves. It’s the same for our minds. In this digital age, we are bombarded with information. A 24hr news cycle and friends available at the tap of a screen — my phone was the main problem. I couldn’t put it down. I would check Twitter, then two minutes later, I would look at the latest football news or my Instagram feed. My brain was constantly on, processing information without a break. I read an excellent article by Jake Knapp about the distraction free phone. I stopped using Facebook. I deleted the Twitter app from my phone. And Instagram. And news apps. And games. This is my phone screen today. My phone is what it needs to be, a smart phone which tells me when my train is going to arrive and how to get to a meeting. It’s a music player and fitness tracker. But, importantly, it’s not a source of constant information. If I want to check Twitter or see the news, it is a little effort, so I only do it when I need to. The news is mostly negative — we all know this. But in this 24hr, 365 day news cycle, negativity has risen to new levels. I‘m very selective about what news I read and I have dramatically reduced the amount of news I digest. I would be tempted to ignore the news completely, but to quote my awesome friend, Tom Price; “To be a disciple and a citizen of the world we are called to engage with its brokenness” It’s not that difficult to manage the news you read. I deleted the news apps on my phone. I now try to get a more rounded feed of news, looking out for positive news. The news leaves out a lot of excellent positive stories — bad news is better for clicks and ratings. Try something like positive.news or read this and feel a bit better about our world. Whenever I start to struggle, I write. One of the ways I try to deal with my anxiety is to obsessively think about how I can avoid anxiety and worry — with the hope that if I just get a hold of my thoughts, I can get back on with my day. This ends up with my thoughts spiralling out of control. I am not able to identify the logical, normal thoughts from fear. Writing all this down helps to bring clarity and control back to my mind. Talking about what I am feeling helps me as well. Occasionally, I look back through old entries in the journal I keep on my phone. The anxiety which felt so strong 6 months ago seems almost ridiculous when you have a clear mind. This was the game changer. The most powerful tool I have found to combat anxiety. Take my anxiety about illness and getting food poisoning — for about two years, we couldn’t have raw chicken in our house because cooking it caused me so much anxiety. I had a course of Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT) in 2015. It was helpful, but the positive effects didn’t last long. CBT teaches us that when we have anxious thoughts, our anxiety becomes stronger the more we think about it. CBT teaches us to ignore those thoughts, which interrupts the increasing anxiety. This year I had a more general therapy and it revolutionised my state of mind. The same techniques CBT taught me were enforced but instead of passively ignoring the anxious thought, I interrupt it with a positive thought. This was in no way easy. What helped was having a positive thought on standby. So, when an anxious thought hit, I would stop, breathe, and put all my effort into focusing on that one thought. Now when I cook chicken I can either think about the good meal I am about to enjoy or the risk of food poisoning. The way we think about things is a choice — I can choose to embrace joy and positivity. None of this comes easy - anxiety, in my experience, was a gradual decline. By the time I was aware of where I was, I was already deeply lost. Having a positive thought amid debilitating anxiety isn’t easy. Writing takes effort, as does putting down the phone and exercising more. But with perseverance, I hope my mind will be in an even better place by this time next year.",2017
Operation: Calm the Mind Down,"A year ago I found myself wide awake at 5AM after a New Years party with my friends. I was still awake because my mind would not let my body go to sleep — it was convinced that things-were-not-OK and needed fixing, despite my friends all sleeping peacefully around me and the birds chirping outside. Desperate to get to sleep, I researched insomnia and paranoia on the internet. I discovered a webpage about Generalized Anxiety Disorder and I read it with fascination — it described my mind so well, including even the kind of physical activities I enjoyed (rock climbing, martial arts). I followed a 10-minute calming technique from that site called Progressive Relaxation, and I was soon asleep. That’s when I truly realized that I was an anxious individual. Sure, I’d identified as “stressed out” or “worrywart” in the past, but I figured everyone would be in those situations. But when I could see my anxiety so large next to the calmness of those around me, I realized that my anxiety was something my mind was intent on having, despite it being unneeded. For the past year, I’ve been studying my mind in detail — trying to understand all of its mental states, to see what techniques can change its mental state, and ultimately, to be able to avoid ever sinking into such a deep pit of anxiety again. This post is an overview of what I’ve tried, and how it’s worked for me. I am not a psychologist or a scientist. I encourage everyone to investigate their mind for themselves, and I hope my quest can give you ideas. Getting Away From It All Just after that New Years party, my partner and I spent a winter in the woods. We had already planned the trip, with the goal of seeing how different the world and our selves could be. We learned a lot, but as I detailed in my post on the trip, I found out that my mind could even become anxious during walks along the beach. It was at that point that I actually started an “Operation Calm the Mind Down” spreadsheet — I was determined to figure out my anxiety once and for all, gosh darn it. Compassion Meditation When we got back to SF, I immediately signed up for the Stanford Compassion Cultivation Training course, an 8-week class inspired by Buddhist teachings on compassion for yourself and others. Our only homework was to meditate each day, using a different meditation mp3 each week. At first, I was only meditating every few days, as it felt like a chore that wasn’t producing anything for me. But then our third week was a self-compassion meditation, and whoah, I could see the effect of those sessions! From then on, I meditated nearly every day. Somehow, the self-compassion script could kick me out of my fast-paced analytical mind into a slower nurturing mind, and affected my approach to the world that day. I didn’t suddenly walk around as a Zen monk, but I could feel my edges soften. I’ve recorded a version of that self-compassion meditation here, if you’d like to try it for yourself. I also recommend reading Tara Brach’s Radical Acceptance and Thupten Jinpa’s Fearless Heart for more on compassion. Of course, that meditation may not do the same for you. That’s why I encourage would-be meditators to explore the hundreds of meditation scripts and styles out there. Find out if there’s one that’s Just Right™. Flotation Tank A flotation tank, or sensory deprivation tank, is a coffin-like structure with gallons of heavy salt water inside it. Once you go inside, you turn the lights off and float for an hour or two. They are now popular enough that you can find them in cities, like Reboot in SF. As it turns out, I adore being inside a flotation tank (and my fear of the dark doesn’t follow me in!). I often feel significantly calmer after — and I can see the proof of that in how okay I am with simply wandering around the nearby parks and not rushing off to get back home. If I had infinite time and money, I might start every day off with a flotation tank session. However, I don’t, so I only go every few weeks or when I feel a particular need for it. If you’ve never tried it and you have the resources to make it happen, try it out and see what effect it has on you. And then perhaps in the great big beautiful tomorrow, startup offices will all have built-in flotation tanks. :) Acupuncture I’ve always been a very Western medicine kind of girl. But, in the quest to calm the mind, I didn’t want to leave any stones unturned. Especially stones that are down the street and oft-recommended. So I went to SF Community Acupuncture and asked for treatment focused on anxiety. While I sat there with the needles in, I did various breathing meditations like counting to 10 and feeling the heart. (If I didn’t, then my thoughts would wander, and they’d likely wander into anxious territory… can’t have that!) I enjoyed the session and felt more relaxed after. For me, acupuncture didn’t have as much of an effect as the flotation tank and has a similar price point, so I opted not to go back for a second session. Kirtan (Chanting) Kirtan is a style of call-and-response chanting from the Hindu tradition. As it’s done here, it’s often a circle of people with a few drums and shakers, and they’ll all follow a chant leader. The chanting is melodic and changes tempo, getting faster and slower. A friend suggested it to me, and I checked it out one morning at Laughing Lotus SF. When we first started chanting, I found myself distracted by worries about getting the words right. But then, the chanting got so fast that my mind didn’t have a space to worry, and poof, the worries were gone! I felt amazing afterward, almost high — and I found myself being sociable with strangers, a sure sign of an improved mental state. From then on, I became a regular at each Tuesday/Thursday kirtan session, and I eagerly looked forward to the moments that the chanting would go so fast that it’d kick my anxious thoughts out. (So, yes, I do tend to get a bit anxious waiting for that moment… funny mind!) Biofeedback Therapy At this point, I had discovered various techniques to semi-reliably transform my mental state for a few hours up to a day. But I didn’t want to be dependent on flotation tanks and kirtan groups. I wanted a more permanent mental change. It was time to bring in the big guns: therapy… biofeedback therapy! I had heard of it once, found one doctor locally who did it, and decided to try one session. First we talked like regular old therapist-client, so he could find out my concerns and goals. Then, the fun part: he stuck electrodes on my head. The electrodes monitored my brain waves, which got displayed on a screen in front of me, divided into moving graphs of Alpha, Beta, and Theta waves. The waves were then turned into sound — something like an ocean/organ remix — which I listened to with headphones. Then I would hear beeps whenever my Beta and Theta waves went above a certain level. The Alpha waves are more associated with calmness, and Beta more with thoughts, so our goal was for me to be able to raise my Alpha and lower my Beta. For around 30 minutes, I sat there with my eyes closed, listening to the sound of my brain, and noticing the beeps when my brain went higher into thought-y territory. (I’m not a neuroscientist, apologies for inaccuracies/oversimplifications here.) After that first session, I felt calm, more able to take my time with things. I decided to go for another 12 sessions to see what my mind would learn from the Alpha wave training. It was a mind-opening experience which I could write much more about, but here were my main take-aways: Anxiety Tracking Once I started the biofeedback therapy, I started tracking my mental state even more rigorously. I wanted to be able to report to the therapist how the week actually went, and not just base it on the last hour of data. I experimented with various trackers focused on mental health, but then I simply downloaded Grid Diary and I set up a square each day for “When was I anxious today?” and “When was I calm today?”. That tracking helped me become much more aware of my own triggers and motivated me to address nagging issues that were burdening my mind. Tibetan Buddhist Retreat During the last few weeks of my biofeedback therapy, I started reading a Buddhist-inspired e-book, Meaningness. Buddhism has many teachings on non-reactivity and on realizing the nebulosity of the self, and those teachings complemented my biofeedback realizations beautifully. Those teachings gave me even more permission to let go of my attachment to my self and to my anxiety. I saw how my mind was helped by the Buddhist-inspired self-compassion meditation and I wanted to know if going further into Buddhism would help me even more. So, like a good investigator girl, I went into Buddhism for 4 months. Specifically, I spent my fall at the Nyingma Institute of Tibetan Buddhism in a program called the Human Development Training retreat. We’d spend each day in sessions of Tibetan-style meditations, Kum Nye (Tibetan Yoga), and inquiries into the nature of self. We also had “work practice” each day, where we’d do house chores while observing our mind. It was an incredible experience, and I hope to write so much about it in the future. But for now, what I will say is that: My mind has spent 3 decades learning how to be anxious — it’s very good at it. So I will continue this journey with a vigilant yet delicate watch. May you all fare well on your own journeys into the mind.",2017
Who will read my book?,"A recent comment someone made dredged up a lot of unwanted anxiety. There are reasons I haven’t finished that book. One is time (a weak excuse), and another is fear (a stronger excuse). Fear of criticism, sure, but that’s not what really stops me. It’s more a fear of failure. A sense of not-being-good-enough. Some of that comes from general anxiety, but most comes from the simple truth that there are so many real writers out there. So many good, amazing, legendary authors who constantly inspire me to write, but who concurrently paralyze my creativity for fear of comparison. Why would anyone read my book, when there are good ones out there? Even the pretence of comparing myself to my favourite storytellers seems laughable. How could I possibly compare myself to the likes of J.R.R. Tolkien, Neil Gaiman, Guy Gavriel Kay, Brandon Sanderson, Michael Ondaatje, Claire Cameron, Dave Sachs? I can’t, really, but it’s hard to dismiss chills resulting from an evocative and inspirational turn of phrase. It’s hard not to wonder if I could craft something even remotely as evocative. I jot it down, highlight or cut-and-paste it into my notebook (love the Kindle App). A permanent reminder of how much better their storytelling is than mine. And then I stop. Stop whining. Stop lamenting. Stop comparing. The only way to truly stop, is to start. Start writing. Start storytelling. It’s my story. It doesn’t need to be their story. A story that someone wants to read. Or, maybe, it’s just a story I want to tell. Reading those greats doesn’t make me great, but it imbues a sense of what great looks and sounds like. And that is what helps me strike a path towards… something. Not greatness. Maybe a story about greatness. It’s hard to put stuff (read: whatever it is you are privately passionate about) out there. But once you do it’s like anything else. It’s like exercise, or dieting/cleansing. Habits are formed. They don’t just happen. Some writing will be good. Some will be bad. But you can’t have one without the other. If I’m stuck and particularly sucky about my chances of ever finishing a book, I read. I read or listen to those who inspire me. Yes, they are the same ones who often make me feel inadequate. It’s a circle. Or cycle. A loop. Storytelling journeys are looping, not linear. Telling my story leads me to others, that lead back to mine. Reading my story will move others along their own journeys. Or it will put them to sleep. Or frustrate them. I just need to get the story out there. That’s what matters. It’s not the only thing because, yes, it does matter (to me) that people read and enjoy and ask to read more. But we still have to start the story somewhere. They (my fictitious, fickle audience) have to be given a chance to read it before they can decide whether it sucks or not. So, who will read my book? I haven’t the faintest, but I’m confident that the answer will be no one if I don’t finish it. Off to it. Go away now so I can get writing, ok? Don’t leave any comments. That will just make me procrastinate more. Really. Thanks, but no thanks. That said, if you are at all interested in supporting my creative endeavours, you’re in luck! I’ve just joined Patreon, a simple way for people to contribute to Project: Write the book and get great rewards in return (one of which is immortality. Don’t knock it until you’ve tried it). It’s kind of like Kickstarter.",2017
What I’ve Learned from a Lifetime of Fear,"Name: Alexa CrowderGender: FemaleAge: 14City: Palo Alto On the first day of school at Castilleja this year, Michelle Poler came to speak about fear. She spoke about her experiences conquering her fears and what she learned as a generally anxious and fearful person. I related to many of the things she said as if she had been describing my life. I’m somewhat of an expert on fear. It’s been in my life for almost as long as I can remember, and it usually comes for irrational reasons and at very inconvenient times. I can remember feeling extremely anxious and uncomfortable as early as age four. Sometime during preschool, I developed an extreme fear of fire drills. To be clear, I was not afraid of actual fires; just the drills. I’ve never been able to understand exactly what made me so terrified of that alarm going off, but it quite literally consumed my life as a young kid. At some points in elementary school, my fear was so extreme I would start crying if I saw a teacher with a red folder, because of the association to emergencies and alarms. If two adults were talking, there was no doubt the subject was an upcoming fire drill. Some mornings, I would step out the door and declare it “smelled like a fire drill”. I seemed to believe fire drills were the center of everyone’s life, especially mine. Of course, the “fire drill era” all seems very silly to me now, but I know it felt very real at the time, and it’s actually not very different from my recent fears and anxieties. After the craziness with fire drills ended, I got a couple years of peace. But the summer before 7th grade, fear came back. It came in a tsunami-like wave of anxiety that lasts to this day. It surfaced with fears of eating, passing out, heart attacks, and other bodily problems. I started having panic attacks, and for a while, anxiety absolutely controlled my life. Then, I started working very hard to combat it. I put my mind to work, trying to get my brain to believe that I was safe. I started to develop ways to calm my brain and body when I felt anxious. It felt like training my mind for the anxiety Olympics, constantly calming myself. It required believing in myself and in the possibility that things would get better. One thing I’ve learned to appreciate about fear is that I am the one who controls it. This can either make you feel alone and hopeless or empowered and free. There are no outside causes; the problem and the solution both come from you. It does not mean it’s your fault, it just means you have the ability to fix it. This is something I was too young to realize with my fear of fire drills, and it took me a long time to realize it with my new anxieties. I try as often as I can to view fear as something I control, not something that controls me. None of this means that I am completely fear-free or that my anxiety is gone and I do everything with complete self-assurance. Everything is definitely a work in progress and goes up and down very often. I still have to take deep breaths and talk to myself. I still avoid things every once in a while because I’m afraid my anxiety will get in the way. Through my lifelong encounter with fear and anxiety, I’ve established enough confidence to trust myself, and that alone makes me feel very empowered.

5 Self-Care Interventions To Try At Your Desk,"Scalp Massage: This quick self-massage can help relax you, and release the tension that can lead to headaches. Spread all 10 fingers around your scalp, and using your finger pads, maintain a firm pressure while making small circles. Next, place your index and middle fingers together and find your temples (just on either side of your eyes). Press into the tight spots (believe me, you’ll find them) and again, make small circles. Finally, take hold of your earlobes, and pull down gently. Work your way up your ear, pinching the cartilage between your thumb and first finger. One branch of acupuncture maps the entire body onto the ear, so attention here may bring benefits to your entire system. Breathe: When we’re anxious or scared our respiration rate speeds up as the sympathetic nervous system prepares for action. This is helpful if you’re being chased by a lion, but unnecessary for most work and life stress. Fortunately, bringing your awareness to your breath can reduce this fight-or-flight response. Lengthen Your Exhale: While breathing in and out through the nose, try exhaling for twice as long as you inhale. It’s simple, but it works: A recent study found this 2:1 breathing practice, when done twice a day for 5–7 minutes, lowered the heart rate and diastolic blood pressure of patients with hypertension. Three-Part Breath: This is based on a yogic breath called Deerga Swasam. From a seated position, lengthen your spine long. Place one hand on your chest, and the other on your abdomen. (Make sure your abdominal muscles are relaxed.) On the inhale, first feel your belly expand and fill up with air, then feel your rib cage expand, and finally feel your collarbones lift up towards the sky. On the exhale, feel your collarbones lower, your rib cage relax, and your belly draw in. Once you’re comfortable with breathing into all three parts of your torso, try lengthening your exhale, and repeat at least 5 times. Note: Stop immediately if any of these breathing practices make you feel dizzy or lightheaded. Chair Yoga: By linking the body to the breath, gentle yoga can help trigger the relaxation response of your nervous system. Forward Bend: Forward bends help to bring your focus inward and calm your mind. Push your chair a little away from your desk. Sit on the edge of the chair so that your spine can lengthen, and widen your legs about hip distance apart. Place your hands or forearms on the edge of your desk, and hinge forward from the waist. When the spine begins to round, drop your head, close your eyes, and breathe gently in and out through your nose. If you’re flexible, you can let your elbows fall into your lap. Cat/Cow: Cat/Cow actively combines breath and movement, promoting the relaxation response, and helps relieve back tension all the way from the base of your spine to your neck. Find the same starting position as for the forward bend. This time, place your palms on your thighs, just above your knees. On the exhale, round your back and drop your head towards your lap. This is “cat.” On the inhale, arch your back, and look up towards the sky, coming into “cow.” Try an Acupressure Point: Acupressure is a form of TCM (Traditional Chinese Medicine) based on the same meridians used in acupuncture. The theory is that energy (or Qi) flows through the body along the meridians. Specific points along these energy pathways can be stimulated to address imbalances in mind, body and spirit. Pericardium 8, also known as the “Palace of Anxiety” is located in the center of your palm. It will probably be slightly tender to the touch. Using the thumb of your other hand, press into the point and hold, or make small circles. Do this for a couple of minutes on each hand. Sip Some Tea: It’s not a myth — sipping chamomile tea may actually calm you down. A study in 2009 found that chamomile extract was helpful for people with mild to moderate generalized anxiety disorder. The tea form may also relax you, although it is not recommended for people with asthma, or pregnant women.",2017
Chapter 18 : House of Cards,"Over the last week I’ve had this nagging doubt that the infrastructure I’m attempting to build as I start my new life won’t lead to a sturdy foundation but rather a flimsy house of cards. How am I to know? My therapy session last night was full of defense mechanisms and my wall was fully up, so this article will be my extra session for the week. People often express when upset, anxious, or bored that they feel ‘stuck’, as if Cousin Vinny is speeding by while their tires churn through mountains of mud. My problem is a bit different, I don’t feel stuck. Rather I believe I’m in the midst of changing gears, going from first gear into second gear, and I’m struggling to grapple with the proper motivation to do just that. The “P” word has been thrown around me whenever a conflict came up in my past or present. Not pathetic, not pithy, not pretentious, not perplex, but potential. As if somehow I have this great wealth of knowledge and expertise to share with this world, but only if I decided to do so. I must admit I get it. There are moments when I fail no doubt, but there are moments I can look back when I felt like I soared. Here is a tiny example. Our first week in SE Asia as part of my graduate school program, our professor held a small contest during the academic portion of the week to identify who provided the most thought provoking, attentive, and substantive discussion comments to the class. The idea no doubt was to encourage us to participate since it was the summer, the program would end in one month, and you could see in each other eye’s that some students had already checked out. (Oh the eyes, how much we give away through our eyes!). The winner would be selected by their peers and would receive a small treat at the end of the week, an opportunity to “sky dive” in the high flyer simulator in Singapore. I decided at the outset of that week that I would win this contest, and not only so, I would try to win. There is a vital difference between those two statements. Sometimes we win with little effort or smarts(cough, cough), or sometimes we need to really scrap and claw to win (Come on Jags!). I will fully admit that too often in my life I’ve been able to win (or at least get by) with little to no effort. Somehow this has become a defense mechanism for me, a theory I fall back on when I lose. I think in my head “Well I only lost because I didn’t try”, and yes I’ve always been a sore loser as evidenced by my lack of a 7 iron. So now that I decided to win and to try to win it meant I wanted to win. Ahh the word “want”. Especially under the guise of how older generations view millennials, “want” has become a word that is often used through the prism of selfishness. That if we did everything we wanted we would just lay on the couch all day watching Netflix. But what if what we wanted actually enabled us to succeed, and what we thought we “should” do actually prevented us from succeeding. Sort of a weird conundrum but bear with me. When Friday rolled around and it was time to vote I knew I had the contest in the bag. Not because I thought I was the winner (I didn’t vote for myself), but it was clear to me in the conversations I was having with peers both inside and outside the classroom that my comments had sparked their interest and increased their level of engagement with the course and trip at large. (I should note by the end of the month long trip my comments became a bit of a personal quirk because they all followed a 3 step process : bring up a past learning, reference the new learning, identify how the difference between those two learnings is important). When my name was announced as the winner I was flush with pride. On the bus ride leaving Singapore University on our way to the Tiger Brewery (to cap of our week of classroom learning), I was able to snag a solo window seat and just look outside at the countryside. In that moment, sitting in that seat, I had done something so rare up to that point in my life. I had hit my potential. I decided I wanted something, I went for it, and I got it. The realization was so cathartic, so powerful, that to this day I still revel in the smile that came forth across my face that day. That moment is very similar to my “coming out” moment, when what I decided I wanted to do trumped what I thought I should be doing. Circling back to the idea of the “P” word, one thing I’ve realized in therapy is that I don’t have a fear of failure, but rather a fear of success. That if try really hard and don’t succeed, well then I can’t fall back on “Well If I had tried”. But what if I try really hard and then do succeed? I don’t like the limelight, I despise trophies, don’t desire extravagance, and ceremonies occupy a Winterfellian place in my heart. So if I’m not motivated by the allures of success, what does motivate me? Fear, and thus the difficulty in getting into 2nd gear. It’s time to for me stop tapping on the window and just open the door. As one life ends, a new life must begin. More to come, Mike One Last Time — Christopher Jackson from “Hamilton”",2017

"Just Like That, My Biggest Contract Is Gone","Would you believe me if I said I asked for it? In my affirmations the last six months or so, I’ve repeated time after time that “I’m ready.” Whether I was laying down or sitting down or on my knees, I recited these words at some point during my meditations or prayers. The universe has a funny way of responding sometimes. Last week I went to pick up a check from my biggest contract. Biggest meaning it accounts for the most significant portion of my income. Earlier in the day, I got an email from my point of contact asking me to stop by her office before I leave. By now you all know I work remotely, so her asking to see me wasn’t really an odd request seeing that I don’t really get to communicate with anyone except over email. But when we finally connected in the hallway and she ushered me to the president’s office, I knew something was up. They let me go. There were some sympathies and what not (you get close to people working in startups, even when you’re not physically around all the time), but at the end of it all I was no longer writing for that company. Shock was probably my first internal reaction, then a bit of anger, but I left without questioning the decision. My fellow freelancers know what it feels like to lose that crucial contract. Most 9–5 workers would probably be feeling at least a bit of fear at having lost a job. For me, once I let the dust settle, my genuine emotion was excitement. I had been planning for this moment. Not consciously, of course, but the universe had been preparing me for this moment since I started affirming that “I’m ready.” The pieces falling into place prior to this moment were all done precisely for this moment. The abruptness of my contract ending was the final piece to the puzzle. For the things I want to do, for all that I expect of myself, there is no easing into it. It’s either I jumped feet first without a net, or I forget all about my ambitions and figure out another path. The universe forced me to jump. It’s telling me right now to ignore my anxiety, put away my fear, and brush away any thoughts standing in my way of taking this next step. The universe has answered me loudly, and is letting me know YES YOU ARE READY. So as I write this, am I at all concerned about the financial loss? Of course. Am I worried about possibly not meeting my expectations? I guess so. Do I know exactly what I’m doing step for step? Not a chance. But I trust in myself, I trust my instincts, and I believe to the core of my soul in every sign I’ve been given. In time, it will all make sense… The world always makes sense as long as you’re paying attention. Thanks for reading. More posts like this on C.R.Y.

The failure inherent in celebrating failure.,"Should we not be concerned as to whether the fear of error is not just the error itself? – G.W.F. Hegel Anonymised: I’m compiling content for a publication that celebrates failure in art schools (as an important and valuable part of the learning process). Please could you maybe dig into your hard drive and rescue a piece of work that you believe or believed at the time, to have “failed” from your years at art/design school? MLA: That sounds interesting and I would like to help. however (and I appreciate that this may sound arrogant), I have never understood my work in terms of failure. To be sure, it was not because I thought my work was successful, but rather that I haver never defined it in either of those terms. I’ve been dissatisfied with some of my work, but that is not the same as thinking of it in terms of failure. That is too say, failure is too objective and implies no redeeming factors, whilst also assigning blame either at the work (outcome) or the designer, rather than the conditions under which the work was produced. Dissatisfaction, in contrast, is much more subjective, and can lead one to ask what it is that is producing the feeling. An understanding of social forces would be essential at this point, as this will facilitate critical reflection and not just an analysis of the self. To clarify my position, I am not saying that failure is not an important thing to concern ourselves with – for clearly there are (designed) things that fail – but that such failures are often with a particular design not fulfilling their expected intentions. For example, a building collapses and kills its inhabitant because of a poor design decision. That is clearly something that we can agree is a failure. My own designs have rarely been overly concerned with such clearly identifiable, objective realities. I am much more interested in developing my understanding of the world through critical analysis (e.g. economic, cultural, historical etc.). Such an approach recognises the complex manner in which design comes to exist in the world (e.g. capitalist modes of production and particular ideological framings (neoliberalism, instrumental rationality etc.) and so place design in a context. I would add, it has been interesting to watch the rise of a happy/positive aesthetics. It seems to me that this is an attempt to allay the anxiety that many creative practitioners feel, and students in particular. However, such an approach, ‘embrace failure,’ is problematic, as it assumes that the anxiety is connected to a fear of failure and not the result of social conditions – being impoverished, negotiating precarious and exploitative working conditions, facing oppressive regimes and infrastructures, and indebtedness. Indeed, this notion that failure is located at the level of the individual has lead to an overwhelming array of workshops and projects that present the impact of their work in a positive manner. As such, it follows the tendency to locate problems with individuals and not at the level of society. Indeed, I would suggest that being encouraged to embrace failure will likely compound and exasperate the feeling of anxiety that it seeks to placate. Not only are such approaches ineffective, they are also likely to be detrimental in the longer term, as there no method for addressing the fear of failure. Neil Curtis has recently explored such an understanding within a neoliberal framework. He writes: “…the capacity for any ideology to persist needs to be understood in relation to the ontological anxiety engendered when our world begins to fall apart and the tendency for dasein to try to practically rebuild what is broken rather than theoretically reflect on the nature of the fault” (Curtis, 2013). One of my students recognised that they were actually quite happy and relaxed, and then almost immediately began to react to this positive assertion in an anxious manner, along the lines of ‘I’m worried that I’m not worried’ The way through anxiety then is to analyse the cause and not fetishise the symptom. That entails critically understanding the forces – both material and intangible (e.g. discourse, laws, norms, ideals) that shape our understanding of success and failure (i.e. capitalism, neoliberalism, instrumental reason) and then participate in creating both the spaces and times and the techniques and strategies for resisting them — not on our own, but rather building both with others, for both ourselves and others. I would add one final point, which is that failure is an aspect of particular modes of production and that computational techniques and the ideology associated with them has radically transformed this. For example, a book with a print of 100,000 would be costly to produce and therefore the avoidence of errors becomes critical. Graphic design is intimately tied up with print production and this notion of cost, which is why it places so much emphasis on formal skills. You need to know how to do something well and effeciently so that you can participate in the print production process. Computing has changed a lot of that in two main ways. Errors can now be corrected quickly and effectively as the. Obviously there will be errors that may be hard to locate or identify, but once they are recognised they can be corrected or ‘patched’ over. The second point is the discourse of computer scientists and its entanglement with algorithmic capitalism. – References Curtis, N. (2013). Thought Bubble: Neoliberalism and the Politics of Knowledge.

1/9/2017- The Day I realized My Heart Was Crying.,"January 7th. Seven days into 2017; I was awoken by severe chest pains like nothing I had experienced before. Chest pains followed by dizzy spells and a bunch of “what the fuck?”’s. The top of my shoulders were killing me and this persisted all morning and into the afternoon. I knew I had to go to the hospital, after all, everyone on Facebook said I should so it must be something terrible. But as a ritual girl, I knew I couldn’t just get in the car before doing what I know to do- go over my check list. First I knew I had to take a thorough bath, I mean, I always do but this one had to be extra por si a caso el doctor lindo me chequea. I had to pick the perfect pair of of panties, last thing you want to do is be in a hospital bed where at least a dozen people check in and around you and your panties at aint on point. I also wanted to shave again even though I had shaved days ago because I had a feeling they’d stick all those little sticky things that rips the hair off your flesh so I though minimizing the hair would make that part of it a little less painful. I packed an overnight bag just in case I had to stay and in it, as always, I packed things I knew I wouldn’t use like, pens, a book to read, my charger, neck pillow and a sweater. I did use the charger and neck rest but I never wrote anything on paper and I never read the book, as suspected. After hours of full examinations, results confirmed that my heart and arteries were great but that wasn’t the case for the muscles around my heart. I was shocked. I immediately turned into a poet. Asking myself questions only a poet would ask “Who’s been abusing me into an ache?” “Who’s been loving me into a chest strangle, hurting the muscles in my heart like the muscles were my face and the abuse, their fists?’ “Who penetrated into an enclosed spaced I had protected for so long?” I spent the weekend on that bed. I was being tested for everything under the sun. I kept wondering if sadness can be detected through blood cells, can they hear or see a bloodstream cry? I wondered if they’d come come back to me and specifically ask me who’s been hurting me. I had so many questions but I rested and slept a lot. They gave me Zanax. I had never taken Zanax or any prescribed narcotics before. But my anxiety was unbearable, often times, sending me into an angry and very nasty hysteria. Pobresita the nurses. They didn’t like me very much, hell, I didn’t like me very much. But the Zanax helped me. I slept a lot and I was calm. The doctor came to see me. He wasn’t el lindo I had envisioned but he was very nice. He’s the one who suggested I take the Zanax. He told I should see a coach therapist. Or maybe it was a behavorial therapist. Anyway, he explained that they could teach me how to learn my anxiety triggers, how to calm myself down when I already have anxiety and different coping skills with “stressful” situations or circumstances. I just nodded my head and listened. He said my chest pains were a result of consistent anxiety attacks and prolonged stress masking itself as a heart attack. Who knew? I sure the fuck didn’t. Again. I was shocked. I was scared. But mostly, I felt so bad. How did I allow this to get so bad, I thought. But did I really? I mean, how much control do I have over an anxiety disorder? All? None? I had so many questions but none of that mattered. I was here. It got here. I am always stressed the fuck out, worrying about shit and over people who sleep like infants at night, meanwhile, I’m up, with full blown insomnia trying to figure out there problems and my own. I haven’t cried much. Now I think it’s because my heart has been doing all the crying for me. Crying, silently, alone, taking one for the team. I think it took one too many though and I feel so bad. I’ve been resting a lot and sleeping. I think this is the part where I am super depressed. #52Essays2017 #2",2017
An Uncommon Cure For Anxiety,"How much stress or anxiety do you have? If you’re like most people you don’t realize your level of stress or anxiety until something brings it to the surface. For example, I’ve heard people say, “I was perfectly still lying in bed almost asleep when ‘Wham’ I had this terrible panic attack. I thought I was having a heart attack.” Although it’s next to impossible to measure your level of stress or anxiety it is possible to know when you have too much. Here are some warning signs that something bigger is going on inside. You realize after you read an entire page in a book, that you don’t have a clue what you just read. You’re in a meeting and make an embarrassing remark and for several days each time you recall it you feel stupid all over again. Someone on your team irritates you, so you react by ‘shutting down’ each time you’re in a meeting with that person. Everyone pays because of your irritation with one person. You find it so much easier to get irritated, quick tempered or angry with family members. There are many common ways to reduce stress and anxiety, for example, exercise, meditation, find a coach, go to therapy, and have your doctor prescribe anti-anxiety meds. However, there are many uncommon ways as well. One of these is what psychologists call sublimation. In layman’s terms, sublimation is something that replaces the unwanted behavior with one that produces acceptable acts and feelings, for example, a person who writes unacceptable graffiti all over a wall can be replace it with creating and selling paintings. Sublimation is exactly what a young lady named Hilary did to handle her anxiety that was caused by a serious problem with obsessive/compulsive behavior. Hilary is a racecar driver, but she didn’t start out as a race car driver. She wanted to show horses, but due to a tragedy with one of her horses she couldn’t make herself get back in the saddle. Hilary knew she needed a replacement to help her deal with her obsessive thoughts and anxiety so she began racing sports cars. She replaced one type of horsepower for another. Hilary said it best, “it’s impossible to focus on obsessive thoughts and anxiety when you are racing a sports car 150mph. If you struggle with stress and anxiety your challenge, as was Hilary’s, is to answer these questions. What causes your stress and anxiety? How do you handle it? Do you keep the feelings inside, have outbursts of anger; use alcohol to relax your mind or just do your best to live with it? Finally, what productive things can you do to replace the anxiety?

How to Stop a Panic Attack in its Tracks,"Panic attacks can be terrifying, especially if you’re experiencing one for the first time. They bring along intense feelings of fear and despair and physical symptoms such as sweating, dizziness, and heart palpitations. Even after the attack has ended it can still bring negative side effects to the person who experienced it, such as an irrational fear of the place where they experienced the panic attack. Although it may seem like your only option is to ride out the attack until it ends, there are a variety of different ways in which you can take back control of your body and your mind. 1. Accept and acknowledge the panic attack People tend to panic, naturally, when the symptoms of a panic attack manifest. Your body is using its natural fight or flight response and overloading you with adrenaline when you are dealing with overwhelming amounts of stress and anxiety. Instead of giving into the adrenaline and blindly panicking, acknowledge that you’re having the panic attack and accept it. Once you become aware of the situation, you have a better chance of calming yourself down and allowing the body and mind to relax. 2. Come back to reality When you begin to panic, you might feel that your body and your surroundings aren’t real. Your mind will be on overdrive and your only thought is to run around until the feeling stops. In order to help your mind come to the realization that you’re not in any real danger, you have to break free of the thoughts you are having and ground yourself. You can do this by stopping yourself and truly taking in your surroundings. Once you have truly analyzed the situation and your mind has processed that there is no need to panic, you can regain control of yourself. 3. Take deep breaths Hyperventilation is a common symptom of anxiety. You might feel that you’re not getting enough air and you will breathe harder in an attempt to recover your normal breathing. What is actually happening is that you are receiving too much air. Deep breathing is the answer. Try breathing through pursed lips and take deeper, longer breaths to help slow down your heartbeat and your breathing. 4. Stop negative thoughts and pretend The most common thoughts that pop up in your mind during a panic attack are “the world is ending” and “I’m going to die”. In reality, none of that is actually going to happen even though it might seem like it in the moment. Prevent those thoughts from invading your mind by replacing them with other thoughts, such as “I am fine” or “I’m in control of my anxiety”. Pretend like everything’s normal and your mind will begin to end the fight or flight response. 5. Distract yourself If a panic attack happens and you aren’t doing anything then the panic attack will be your main focus. When anxiety strikes, engage in a different activity to take your mind off of the attack. You won’t be able to fully experience the panic attack if you’re mind is elsewhere. Also, try stimulating your senses. Use an ice cube on your body to divert your attention from the symptoms of the attack to the freezing sensation on your body. You can also run your hands along an object to regain your awareness. The next time that you experience a panic attack, use these methods to lessen the impact that the attack has on your mind and on your body. Remember, panic attacks have no control over you. You are the one in control.",2017
Do I Have a Fear of Fear?,"A while ago, a friend of mine told me to write about what I am afraid of, and so I promptly wrote a blog on the first topic that popped into my head, abandonment, then I closed the topic on fear. Fear is individualistic and what makes me afraid may be nothing to someone else, but it was pointed out to me today, that perhaps I am afraid of a lot more than I think, or may be willing to admit. For survivors of childhood sexual abuse, fear is something that is deeply ingrained from whatever moment it was that forever changed your life. Fear is an emotion that is most commonly brought about by a perceived threat or danger and usually induces a reaction of flight, fight, or freeze.As children, when we are being abused there is not the option of flight; if I could have run away, I obviously would have. Having the ability to fight back is also not possible given the average size difference between a child and a perpetrator. I am small in stature and always have been and I gave all the fight I had but could not hold off a teenager or an adult. That leaves only one option; to freeze. To be so afraid, you literally are physically and mentally frozen is our only way to survive the experience, and because we are most likely molested multiple times this reaction becomes habitual and becomes a repeated pattern throughout our lives.I think I am afraid of fear, if that is even possible. One thing I do know is I’m tired of it. I’m sick of it kicking my ass at every corner and causing me to look over my shoulder both physically and emotionally. I am exhausted from being bouncing between hyper and hypo sensitivity. I blame it on my illnesses and convince myself there are other reasons…I’m too nervous to go there, I am too shy to talk to them, I’m too insecure to try that, and the list goes on. Sure, they are likely enhanced by my disorders but the common denominator, regardless of what I try to label it as, is fear; the root cause of so many emotions. Even as I write this now I find fear of what you, the reader, will think, lurking in the back of my mind. When I become overwhelmed with life, or with my illnesses, the freeze instinct kicks in for me. I feel so inundated with thoughts and emotions that my mind can no longer differentiate between a past threat and a perceived one, so my habitual response is to shut down and become emotionally and physically disabled. My mind can’t handle the intensity of so many emotions, so the instinctual answer is to shut down all emotions, thereby removing the perceived fear which will lead to me being hurt again, while physically, my body becomes exhausted and numb from being riddled with tension. It is those periods of time, which vary in length that I find it difficult to focus or get anything done. I am in survival mode and whatever strength I have left is used to bring me out of that frame of mind.The fear of failure is a big one for many people but it does not necessarily mean it will stop them from trying to achieve or accomplish something. Being a survivor with the added bonus of having Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD) takes whatever emotion, in this case fear, and enhances it to a level that feels like sheer terror. To step outside my comfort zone feels like jumping off a cliff with a parachute and not only convincing yourself that it won’t open but actually preparing for the disaster, with not even a glimmer of hope that it might actually open. So I spent most of my life staying within the confines that I had set and became very good at the things within those boundaries, but did not venture much outside of those lines, for fear of not succeeding. For fear of what not only others would think or say, but fear of my own inner critic which I already battle with daily. The fear of being vulnerable is also incredibly difficult for survivors because as children someone took advantage of us when we were most susceptible. I think that is why so many survivors build such a thick wall of emotional protection around them, anything to avoid that feeling again. I know for me allowing myself to be emotionally vulnerable is a daily battle, like splitting the day between being a bricklayer and being part of a demolition crew. It involves stepping outside your comfort zone if you are to let someone in and that for me is incredibly difficult. I feel like a turtle extending its neck to take a look around and perhaps get a different view, which then suddenly gets spooked and reverts back into its shell, becoming more afraid to come back out each time.As with the rest of my healing process, I am a bit impatient and would like to speed the whole process up until I get to the point that fear no longer rules my life. I want to just wake up and feel safe and confident enough to take on the world. I am, however, a long way from that, and so as with everything I proceed forward with baby steps. Starting this blog and allowing my writing to be put out there for others to see is a step in the right direction and as with anything although the first step is the hardest, the second is required to move forward.",2017

The Torment of Anxiety,"You’re sitting with a friend or loved one at a table in a public restaurant, and they begin to share their struggle with anxiety. Suddenly they stop in mid-sentence, and as you are listening attentively, you are unaware of what’s about to happen. Just talking about their anxiety has triggered the anxious feeling and it’s about to become overwhelming. Next, they put their head down and ask to be excused from the table. It’s happened again, the beginning of a full-blown anxiety attack. After all, fighting back the tears of anxiety and the exhaustion that comes with it is not an easy task. It takes energy to overcome anxiety. The restroom is a safer place, out of sight of so many eyes and ears. Obviously, no one wants to break down in the middle of a restaurant or any other public place. Once they are out of sight, they splash a little water in their face, breathe deeply to gain composure and make their way back to the table hoping to look refreshed. I’ve experienced this scenario many times when working with professionals, business owners and individuals. One thing is for sure, anxiety is all inclusive affecting people of both genders, regardless of ethnicity, personal beliefs or any other individual characteristic. There is one very interesting statistic. Women have more difficulty with anxiety than men. Men struggle with anxiety too. However, it’s second to addiction. What is the cause of all this anxiety? There are several reasons people experience anxiety. You may be surprised that the causes are not emotional but behavioral. Using my gift is to make sure you overcome the core behaviors causing anxiety in my new e-learning course Energy To Overcome Anxiety For example, do you believe guilt is an emotion or behavior? In our society we talk about guilt as an emotion, for instance, “I feel guilty” when in reality, it’s a behavior that can lead to the emotion of anxiety. Guilt — But Dr. Bob, I thought guilt was an emotion? I’ve heard this many times, and my answer never changes. “Emotions come from guilt; for example, the emotion of anxiety and anger, but guilt is a behavior.” If you do a misdeed or make a mistake and believe you need to apologize, it’s natural to feel sorrow or regret. Asking for forgiveness is normal and should be enough. However, if you hang on to the misdeed and begin to experience guilt you are creating a behavior. If a person rehearses the misdeed over and over in their mind, it becomes distorted and feelings become more intense. When that occurs, you are on the threshold of creating anxiety. When guilt becomes a behavior paying penance never ends. In fact, any behavior taken to the extreme will rob energy from every aspect of life. When a person embodies these behaviors they decrease their ability to handle stress, low energy and decrease the immune system to fight off disease. In summary, there are two ways to deal with guilt. Managing a Misdeed or Mistake — Go to the person who hurt by your action and apologize. Be sincere, genuine, and let that be enough. Managing a Guilt Behavior — If you have not apologized do that first. Each time the thought of the incident comes to mind perform the “Thought Stopping” Technique. Say to yourself, “Stop” and begin thinking of something more pleasant. I have a new ecourse, Energy To Overcome Anxiety! Are you feeling tired, drained or simply worn out?

"24 Hours Ago, I Deleted Snapchat","It’s been something I’ve been meaning to do for months now. The app that sucked my time to maintain snap streaks and sucked my phones battery like how I drink my first morning coffee — I down that thing as fast as I can then like Thor, promptly look for “ANOTHER”. Unlike Thor, I don’t smash the mug, mugs are expensive to my current budget. I knew deep down that it would be for the better. I had already confirmed the link that existed between Snapchat and my own personal anxiety. Plus, while I understand the need to monetise their app, they could at least try to target a little. It’s why I dislike TV so much now, ad breaks are extraordinarily long and I rarely see anything that appeals to me. But advertising and social media is a whole other game. What I didn’t know, is how fast everything would improve. My daily schedule is wake up at 10:00, then work like crazy for 90% of the time till around 23:00 or later. Usually around now(16:30), my battery would be hitting 50% and I’d recharge my phone before heading out. But it’s sitting quite happy at 85%, something I’m rather chuffed with. But most importantly, my average anxiety levels have plummeted. Also around now, I usually have to take a walk or pace my room to get all the built up stress and negative thoughts out. Right now, I’m lying in bed reading my Kindle after a solid day of work with one client, sending out quotes to two others and planning what I’m going to say to a dozen others to try get work from them. It feels feckin great. Snapchat was the last piece of social media on my phone. Facebook is now a business tool to me, for managing my page and advertising. Twitter is something I check once in the morning and once more in the evening. I seriously believe everyone should attempt to take a break from social media, I know for me anyway, the improvements I gained in myself far outweigh anything that could be on there.",2017
When your stomach churns,"Gah, I absolutely despise when everything is going well, and then my mind decides to wake up and become irritatingly active. I suppose this is why many people take to mind altering drugs, such as coffee, alcohol, cigarettes, and more. It seems to be a nice plug to stop the leaking water for a moment. After dealing with food related, and social issues for the past 12 years- it is just something that is now permanently with me. Although, I am actively working on defeating these detrimental thoughts- there are days when it just flares up again. For any one who has ever dealt with an eating disorder, or with the issue of getting easily upset over seemingly innocent situations — then you will understand where I am coming from. Today was a particular upset for me, I had just finished work, and was going to eat my lunch with all my friends in the kitchen, when I saw something that made my anxiety levels rise for too quickly. …check this out- this is what caused it, one of my friends after finishing his lunch, decided to then eat a banana. When I saw this I freaked out — why? Because I have had problems with over eating, and I have done this with usually stuff that I deemed to be healthy such as ‘bananas, or peanut butter’, etc… I literally felt my stomach turn to knots, and I felt as though I was physically weak for having witnessed this. Bizarre… I know!! but, the reason that it happened is because, it simply triggered memories of my own personal weakness in the past. If you can follow this, then you are probably in the same rare boat as I am. I just write about these things, because…really- I am the healthiest mentally I have ever been- regarding all my past eating issues, and anxiety- yet there are still ‘Triggers’ out there that I am becoming aware of through these short bouts of anxiety, and trying to sort out.",2017
Can high performance lead to high levels of anxiety?,"Have you ever thought that high performance can actually cause anxiety? In fact if you surveyed leaders around the world they would unquestionably say absolutely not, high performance is a necessary quality for success. However, I’ve found it’s one of four qualities that, when under stress, actually produces anxiety. It’s also important to note this includes all leaders; whether it’s leading a billion dollar company, a family, a religious organization, in any industry, any age and any where in the world. You might say high performing leadership is an “All-Planet” behavior. I have the opportunity to coach high performance leaders who have strong personalities. They want to solve some issue or problem that’s interfering with their ability to perform. Basically to get better at what they do. In a majority of my clients I’ve discovered the High Performance Cycle. Let’s pretend you are in the High Performance Cycle. Here’s what you can expect: You started your career with the desire to “want to” perform at your very best. As the company grew so did your responsibilities and the stress you have to deal with on a daily basis. In time, stress became overwhelming and your desire to “want to” perform transformed into the behavior of “needing to” perform. Your behavior of “needing to” perform created a high degree of anxiety or anger or both. Your next step could be a trip to the emergency room complaining of chest pains, thinking you’re having a heart attack, or to the family doctor worried that you might have one. Ninety-nine percent of the time the diagnosis is Generalized Anxiety Disorder. A little anti-anxiety medication and your off to work feeling a little better, but it’s not over yet. The symptom has been properly dealt with but the underlying behavior has not. The underlying behavior creating your anxiety is the “need to” perform. In todays vernacular you’re not having fun anymore. In the next series of newsletters and blogs I’m going to attack the internal issues that create anxiety and anger in leaders. More importantly we’re going to share with you how to stop the behaviors before you hit the panic-attack button or your doctor says you have generalized anxiety disorder.

Should I Stay or Should I Go?,"Hey guys, I’m in a bit of a pickle right now, debating whether to follow my heart, or follow my mind. I have been given the opportunity to move from the country, to the city, free of rent. The only catch is I have to take the ladies (person who I would be living with) child to and from school each day. It is a massive career opportunity for me because there are loads more jobs going in the city as opposed to a tiny country town like mine. But my mind is telling me no. Anxiety is one thing stopping me from saying yes straight away. I constantly think about modes of transport, because I don’t have my license yet so I would be relying on public transport constantly. I am also worried that I wont get approved for full time work. Moving to the city would mean not seeing my friends or family for possibly weeks at a time, and I would have to quit Hockey. Quitting hockey for me would be like telling a blind person that they can’t have their cane or a seeing eye dog anymore. They’d get by with the help of others, but their life line is gone. And yes, you can always find another team, but the team I have, is special to me. They are a part of me. Hockey is a part of me. Gah my mind is in a jumble. But nonetheless, whatever I choose will be a new chapter of my life. I just need to decide. Have you had any doubts about leaving your comfort zone for a better future? How did you overcome your fears about moving away from family? Leave your responses below! Have a great day! x-Tinara Rose",2017

I reviewed what had happened and what was continuing to happen. Did I have anything I regretted? Would I have done anything different? I looked at it from all sides. Then I imagined being enveloped in compassion. Amazingly it put the event in perspective and it respected the difficulty I had faced and still face. I felt understood.

Thus what insight changes and what becomes resilience here, is recognising that mistaken thinking as a product of the lens rather than the objects being seen through the lens and in that seeing, letting go of the mistaken thinking and feeling we have about who we are and how the world is and doing. In concrete terms I was working with a client who experienced a lot of anxiety at work and constantly needed to get reassurance from her line manager who, not surprisingly, did not seem to trust her, was often exasperated with her and yet always seemed to be keeping an eye on her. All of that felt really real and the force of the feelings drove the behaviours and no one in that situation was having a good time. The thoughts and feelings (as being about the work and the manager rather than being the lens those were perceived through) and resultant behaviours from the anxiety were the misunderstanding that was driving the system Thank you for reading this.

A Thank You Note to My Anxiety,,2017
What’s My Stage Again: The Not Knowing,"I was lucky that for my most recent PET scan I only needed to wait fewer than 24 hours to receive my results. In the past, I’ve waited as long as 5 days for a follow-up appointment where I’d learn what was happening within my body. I’ve tried to suppress my anxious thoughts in that wilderness of oblivion in many ways: I have traveled abroad, spent hours at museums and concerts, gotten acupuncture and massages, binge-watched, soaked in bathtubs, visited aquariums, petting zoos, pizzerias, comic book shops and thrift stores. I have hiked until my feet spasmed and fretted so hard that my heart felt weak. Of course, worrying and fretting has never once helped me. That doesn’t make me stop doing it, though. I worry out of a self-protective instinct to expose myself to every possible worst-case scenario, so that if I actually do receive bad news, I’ll have somehow been prepared. But that’s the secret about worrying: it doesn’t prepare you. It plants a seed within your psyche that germinates and takes root, an insidious, slowly unfurling tendril that chokes your happiness and hope. “I feel alright,” your happiness will say, and your worry will respond, “but that’s how it always happens. Someone feels fine, then they get a bad test result. It has happened to you. You should prepare for the worst.” And so you prepare for the worst, which you don’t like doing, and your pulse quickens and you sweat anxiously over doing something you don’t like that makes you upset. Just when you may calm yourself down, you say to yourself, “either way, everything will be fine. Think of all the good things you have.” Your worry taps you on the shoulder, reminds you it’s still there, and whispers “nothing is okay. The things you love will crumble into dust.” Anxiety and worry will fight you at every turn. For every step forward you take it will try to cast out another rope around your ankle pulling you backwards. Being told not to fret doesn’t work; the only things that sometimes work are distraction, commiseration, and medication. That said, I’ve found that anxiety has another enemy: scrutiny. It withers under close examination. When your anxiety says, “the things you love will crumble into dust,” instead of pushing the thought away (a perfectly natural and valid response that I often employ), sometimes it works to square up with the cruel voice of dread. “The things everyone loves will crumble into dust; that isn’t news to me,” you can tell it matter-of-factly. “A bad thing might happen, worse than you could even imagine,” it may seethe at you. “Yes, I know. A bad thing might happen. I bet I could even imagine the worst thing,” and allow yourself, however briefly, to acknowledge that the worst thing exists (in this example, the worst thing I think that could happen to me would be simplified as “dying,” though in reality it’s much more complicated than that). Don’t force yourself to imagine the experience of the bad thing, simply acknowledging the fact that it exists is enough. It’s like seeing a car in the blind spot of your rearview mirror: you don’t have to turn your whole head and look at it, you just have to glance it to know it’s there. One of anxiety’s greatest weapons is that it makes us feel helpless. The not-knowing robs us of our sense of control, and it can feel dehumanizing. In these instances, there’s no right answer for how to manage your emotions, but if other mechanisms aren’t working for you, try nodding in the direction of your fears, having a conversation with them, letting them know you see them and you’re going to continue onward in spite of their presence. Fear is the ghost that cowers and menaces in the corner of your attic. Recognition is the light you shine on the corner that shows the ghost to be nothing more than a sheet thrown over a box. Say hello to your fear, and keep on moving forward.",2017

My depressive demon,"These demons are terrorists Trying to destroy me from the inside out They claw at my heart and cloud my mind They make my stomach turn My body quiver with unbearable anxiety My hands scratch at my body Any imperfection must be made more imperfect More ugly Made to bleed and relieve some pressure through pain and blood Again and again — it won’t heal My mouth cannot stop itself Foul things emerge There to hurt, rip, break Teeth clench but to no avail I rear the Grendel that I try to hide behind a smile But that smile cackles, cracks It turns itself on it’s head Teeth bare, eyes narrow, pulse quickens Fists clench, nails dig into anything they can Run wild until there is nothing left to destroy Then comes the shame Memory is gone What did it say? Surely that wasn’t me But who else could it be What I am is ugly, repulsive How can I escape myself? Muscles finally relax from their flexion They are exhausted So am I It hurts, I hurt, I have hurt others But why do I still stand? Never again will I let it take control I have to do better, be better, be stronger than myself But then that familiar pull comes As the demons take hold Fighting them, fighting myself No one will prevail How long can it last? How long can I last? For neither can live While the other survives",2017
How Are You???,"I’m seriously convinced that it is the most annoying and useless question in the world and one of the most painful for someone with Social Anxiety. I mean it! I’m always anxious, which means I can almost never honestly say “I’m good, how about you?” as social convention dictates. And yet, When I’m asked this idiotic question, it’s almost invariably a simple case of strict adherence to a long standing social convention. Society requires me to ask you, please just say “good” and ask me the same back so I can comfortably continue to not give one good goddammit about you and your issues. I have two choices at this stage, I can give them their desired “Good” and let them carry on not caring, pleasantly satisfied that they have done their civic duty to engage with others in social Interaction. It’s a bald faced lie but it simply and easily deals with the social convention. 90% of the time I respond with a variant that lets me make a joke and bust the routine, “can’t complain, noone listens when I do”, which earns me a lank stare or a mild giggle at best… while it still meets the “minimal social surface interaction” requirement people would still prefer a simple “Good!” And then, there’s the times when I actually tell them how I’m doing… and as a perpetually anxious person, I tend to have a pretty heavy load on my shoulders at all times… and as I start talking about how I’m doing, how I am struggling, I get the look… You know… the look that says it all!!! OR… They get this incredibly pained look on their faces. See… people don’t care. I mean, 99% of the world doesn’t… they just want to enjoy their social convention and carry on. They don’t actually want an answer, they want to ask to say they asked and feel like they were good people. And then there’s the 0.001%… the best friends. This is the conversation. “How are you doing today?” “oh, im doing ok” **hard stare** “I asked…. HOW are you today?” Most folks have one of these people, sometimes 2 or 3… they can read your pain through your skin, even with a ton of makeup, practising in the mirror and being convinced that they can’t tell, 5 seconds into the conversation, they KNOW… and there’s nothing you can do to avoid it. You have no choice but be honest to them, but you still try it, being socially anxious, the last thing I want to do is expose or look at my pain… but they still draw you out.",2017
I had two anxiety attacks today.,"We talked about protecting women’s bodies in a workshop today. The topic of abortion came up, and some personal anecdotes triggered me. That’s right- I was “triggered.” I heard about the experiences of women who felt forced to conduct their own abortions from ways like consuming poisons to using metal hangers to taking a train across the country for a willing doctor who she has never met because abortions were illegal at the time. My hyper empathy and stress kicks in. I can’t imagine how lonely they felt, and I am horrified they had to endure that. Why tf is it such a hushed topic. I’m not sure if I can describe how an anxiety attack feels because its hard to understand how something painful happening in your mind can become a physcal sensation. I can tell you its a hundred times worse when you’re in a public setting. In this case, I was sitting in a discussion circle where I felt completely exposed- with no shadows to duck in to. I had to count my breaths because my chest was tightening. Adrenaline rushing, nausea inducing. The second attack just came about 15 minutes ago. I was reminded of how real and how raw my heartbreak still is. Its frustrating I know. I’ve been replaced by the one I’d set my intuition on a while back. I knew she’d secured his heart while I was losing my grip on it. Fuckkkkkkkk. He told me to not unfollow him on social media….. fuck that as well lmao. Im hurting and I don’t want to see things that’ll halt my healing. Just because this doesn’t affect him and just because he’s able to handle it well doesn’t mean I’m strong enough. I’m doing better though thats the thing I don’t get. I guess it takes a step backwards to move two steps forward?? smh. I don’t want him to hold back from this new flame. I want him to go for her!! I want him to chase her and feel giddiness of having someone special again. Let this be a chance for him to make it right. Let her be the one to help him let go of the carried weight. I want it for him, but I also want it for me. It’ll give me some peace of mind I suppose.",2017
I want to sleep,"I want to sleep; I want a 15-hour long night and 15 hours more of silence. I want the cold to stay still on top of our beds and smile at it in dreams from the comfort of my covers. I want to rest from pain and distress, from exhausting routines and round trips from one worry to the other. I want to dream like I used to, intense, long and detailed; I want to fly, to be a giant or invisible, to protect the innocent or hide secrets. I´m very sleepy, real life´s weight is overwhelming and the veins in my head are about to give in. I want to sleep without moonlight, and I want a storm of silence to come at night and fall on my mountains. I want to sleep on fresh air, I want every breath to clean me up from worries and fill me up with energy. I want to sleep tonight, truly, even when those out there can´t understand it or look down on me, proud of their sacrifices and still-tolerable weights. I want to sleep, yes, but I also want to wake up. And I want to wake up with ease, angst-free, strong, confident and — most importantly — wide awake.

Drama lessons.,"Everyone at some stage of their life experiences trauma, or at least drama, and the response to that trauma can be a defining contour of our make-up. I am not only talking about veterans back from war, grief, or child abuse l. It could be divorce, a mistake that has been made, bullying or deceit. How we process these moments, and how we are nurtured through them are the intersections of our lives. For some there isn’t the right support there at the time, and it’s only later when the experience that has been tucked away for so long brings itself to the surface because the behavioral acts of self-protection no longer serve us and we are pushed into addictive or aversive acts to run away from or dull the reality of what we know deep inside. The body holds the score. Personally I spent decades in aversive behavior ranging from OCD to binge drinking, workaholism and more. Most were unknown to me and seemed like normal cycles of life (“stages”), and in some respects they were, but deep down my inner dynamo was spinning ten times quicker than it should have been, essentially on high alert running from the pain and/or shame. I was quite the mastermind at keeping the pain away from the prying eye. Humour and aloof coolness can help a great deal in creating an affable and likeable persona when underneath I was ultimately, simply, ungrounded. So now I see what was underneath it all. The dawning has been peeling back to reveal itself over the last few years but ultimately what needed to happen was to let go and admit the painful truth of what I had felt all along. And once I let it in and said yes to it, it was like stepping into a different room where I could see things a little clearer. I didn’t realize but I was angry for what had happened when I was a kid. But so beautifully camouflaged even I couldn’t see it. And when I allowed that in, against the tide of my loyalty to those closest to me, I could push forward. The bigger revelation was that the trauma I was trying to get over was accidentally, not purposefully, created by those who had their own trauma. Tough things happening to them leaving them out on the edge of themselves, alone. They didn’t mean to. They did their best. They just did what they needed to in order to survive. And that meant that in some respects I could have compassion for the errors. And that I could move closer again to them in forgiveness, love and sorrow for what they had been through. I swapped my own anger and blame for empathy and shared understanding. Setting them free set me free. And now it is to the task of creating a new routine, new behaviours of love, self-respect and compassion, and learning to sit with the fluctuating and (less frequent) anxiety of the old behaviours as they occasionally continue to trigger out of habit. Hopefully they will ease out under the hot spotlight of awareness. Darkness doesn’t like the light.",2017
Why It’s Important to Know When Enough is Enough,"Even in the midst of having accomplished 100 things in a day, it’s easy to go to bed at night feeling a sense of incompletion, like your world could drop out under you without a moment’s notice. Somewhere in the back your mind, your head is swirling with responsibilities and tasks. The need for “more” causes us unnecessary stress and anxiety. One that is never-ending and crazy-making. Sound familiar? Hamster-wheeling happens when we’re constantly doing, achieving, performing, and producing, for the sake of “more.” It keeps us going on a level of momentum that doesn’t allow us to fully rest or feel fully satisfied. We often keep going without stopping and seeing where we’re actually headed. You could say it’s history. Starvation, war, conflict. The past trauma of having to survive. Today we are constantly stimulated by technology including social images of people who “have it all and then some.” This can cause us an unnatural, ungrounded fear that somehow we are “not enough.” I’m not talking about your life dreams here and making your goals happen. I’m talking about the little voice in your head that fears that you’re not enough — because you’re not doing enough. It’s the limiting belief that your value is inherently tied to what you produce, perform and do. It’s a limiting belief that constantly throws you off kilter. It’s an unconscious motivating fear that doesn’t allow you to fully settle into the present moment. The idea of “more” and “not enough” are two sides of the same coin. Both offer a feeling of deprivation, striving, searching, straining, and lack. Both come from scarcity consciousness. Both demand conditional states of happiness. Have you noticed how constantly wanting “more” disconnects you from the present moment? It takes you out of your center. It keeps you off balance by thrusting you into the illusion of a future better moment. The constant desire for more puts the mind in a grasping state, one that can never be sated. For many of us, even the present moment is not “enough.” That’s why meditation proves challenging for so many people. The present moment by itself is boring, uncomfortable… lacking in excitement. So instead, we fill the moment with “more.” More things. More distractions. More technology. “Not enough” has become an epidemic afflicting every corner of our outer and inner world from the overuse of our natural resources to the internal anxiety that we are not adequate. “Not enough” is a state of consciousness and not a true reflection of what we have or who we are. It is a perception that often afflicts us on a deep level that we ourselves are often unaware of. Sit with what is. Just here. Just now. Meditation strips away all the mental riff-raff that’s constantly circulating in our head. It helps release our unnecessary cravings so that we can focus on what’s truly important. Anytime you think “more” or feel the pit in your stomach of not enough, ask yourself “What will more truly give me?” “What is that I really want to experience?” “What is enough for me?” It’s easy to fall back into a pattern of more/not enough. Ask yourself, “What am I buying into right now? What am I believing to make myself feel this way?” “Why am I rushing and pushing?” Then ask, “What belief would serve me better?” Change your core operating system. Affirm to yourself positive beliefs you want to reinforce such as, “I am enough.” “I am perfect.” “Life overflows with grace.” “I AM.” Release the idea that you could have done more or been more. Accept what is now. Work with what you have. And if you are — stop beating yourself up. Instead of looking for the next thing, acknowledge what you have now. Look at what you’ve already accomplished and be willing to acknowledge all your creations. Keep counting your blessings, again and again. It’s not about complacency or sitting on your laurels. It’s a cultivation of peace and joy that lives within us, no matter what. It’s an inner-sense of true well-being that exists with or without “more.” And it helps us stay in balance together with the natural flow with life. Inner-fulfillment comes from within. It’s not something we can obtain or “get.” Let’s remember that so we can each live each moment fully, wholly, and completely — with the deep satisfaction of knowing that we are enough.",2017
"“My Personal Depression” — June 24th, 2013","This was a short personal essay I wrote almost four years ago about my struggle with depression and anxiety. A lot has changed since then, but it sets a brief context as to what I’ve struggled with. This isn’t the end of my journey… it’s only just beginning. “I am always fighting with myself. I warn almost everyone about that when they meet me, because my mood can switch from the girls you see in these photos to someone who has lost all the sunshine in her face. It has been a struggle since I was diagnosed with severe depression at sixteen, and it has been an even bigger struggle now. Most people don’t get it and very few have the patience for it. I can be very moody. I can be very mean. I can be very needy. I can be very distant. I can be very isolated. I can be very selfish. I can be very suicidal. I can be very dark. I can be the total opposite of this girl you see everyday. It started in high school when I started feeling incredibly down. My sleeping patterns were off. My eating patterns were scarce. I dealt with alcohol after being exposed at sixteen and would bring it to school to numb the pain. I attempted cutting, but chickened out after a while when I saw real cuts and blood. After my first relationship that went bad I began to overeat and over drink. I never realized the effect it had on me until my ex actually made a comment saying, “Have you noticed that Jackie’s getting fat?” to a mutual friend. I was mad at him, but looking in the mirror one day I could not help but wonder if I was… My biggest problem was never feeling like I was enough. This would be in school, work, my body, my personality, my dreams, and my relationships. I would try really hard to reach goals that were out of my reach. Or rather I would try to achieve these goals and sell myself short to the point where I purposely failed. I never believed in myself. Last year was the first time I was able to plan the Tri-Mentoring Live2Lead Leadership Conference from the beginning, go through challenges, and complete it without giving up. And although most people have seen me complete other goals, I was incredibly close to giving up on those too, especially school. When it’s my dark point my bed becomes my solace. I can lye in it for a full day if I wanted to. I sometimes worry what would happen if I lived alone. Especially because I also neglect my hygiene, whether it’s my hair, my body, my teeth, etc. I really should be taking care of these things, but sometimes I just want to let myself waste away. To be honest I don’t really care about what’s going on outside a majority of the time, and oddly I don’t care if other people care. This is something that needs time and improvement. In my last relationship I put a lot of stress on my ex to be there. I had this idea in my mind of that guy you see in movies who runs in and saves the girl with the mental illness, magically fixing things and making it all better. Who could actually be that guy? Is it even realistic? Well, realistic or not I have been learning for the past little while to settle with my issues, deal with them on my own, and briefly mention them in passing: “I had an episode today, but I’m feeling better” or “I had a panic attack on my way here, but I’m fine now”. Panic attacks happen randomly and can be triggered by a multitude of factors. While being here in Ghana, I had a panic attack in a tro-tro (bus), had to walk across a bridge and get aboard another tro-tro to get home. When I eventually got home I could hardly breathe, but it eased when I was able to sit down and take it in. Back home while I was at the Eaton Center I was standing over a ledge in H&M and suddenly felt like throwing myself to my death. I had to walk continuously before meeting up with a friend so that I could stop myself from doing anything else (for example, throw myself in front of a car). After an episode I never feel like going home. I feel incredibly useless and hate having to face my family after it happens. Not everybody is built to understand me, but not everybody is built to understand mental illness either. Most times we are unaware that someone we know is living with a mental illness, and most times nobody is able to understand the full picture of what that mental illness entails. In fact most people are scared to get into it. Although it is no one’s job to really get involved, it’s still good to read up, but at the same time ask those friends questions. Don’t always assume that whatever you read is exactly what the person is going through. That’s why I titled this post “My Personal Depression”; all of our experiences are different. Never label us under one umbrella textbook definition. I did not write this post to ask for sympathy. I do not write this post for people to understand me. I wrote this post for people to be more aware that a friend of yours can be suffering in silence. I want you to know that depression comes in many forms, and to not be afraid to approach a person who has a mental illness. It’s part of who we are. There is no cure. Instead we are bending over backwards everyday trying to adjust to a society that does not bend over backwards trying to adjust for us. Never disregard someone’s symptoms. Never tell someone to just “get over it”. Your actions and words speak louder than you think. However, if after reading this you see me as fragile, please do not think so. Just look at the girl in these photos and know that I am who I am and have been having a very full life. My cloudy days always have a rainbow to follow. And I never stray far from the shore.”",2017
Why I Started Meditating Daily,"“Nothing has ever opened my eyes like meditation has. It makes me calm and happy, and it gives me some peace and quiet in what’s a pretty chaotic life!” - Hugh Jackman (Emmy Award-Winning Actor) A few years ago, I had been looking for ways to overcome the negative effects of stress, tension, and anxiety so that I would become calmer, happier, more productive, and more efficient with my time. I wanted to change and replace my negative or unwanted thoughts with positive ones. I had discovered the Law of Attraction (aka The Secret) at this stage, but I wanted to combine it with a practice that would make the Law of Attraction a daily focus, so I could find even more happiness, energy, and authenticity in my life. I was looking to crack the code on what it takes to get a more energized life so that I could concentrate on my life goals. I wanted to live a more prosperous life with peaceful and productive relationships. I knew if I wanted to be happier and more energetic, that it was going to require me to be responsible for my life and to take action! Whenever I approached a goal in my life, there was always mental chatter in my head telling me that I couldn’t reach it or that I was not good enough. This makes it extremely difficult to even set a goal, never mind accomplish one. It destroys our energy levels. When I discovered business seminars, I also stumbled across what I was looking for all along — personal development and meditation. Before I started attending seminars, I believed that meditation would overtake my body and mind. There was always something ‘mystical’ about it to me and that’s why I never tried it. What do I mean by mystical? In my mind, I thought meditation was practiced by monks and older people. (That’s what we generally see on magazines!) If they are practicing it, then it must not be cool and it most definitely must be boring, right? My friends would think I was “weird” if they knew I was meditating — I would be the laughing stock! However, when I went to seminars, I found out that really successful and wealthy people practice meditation. Wow, if they do it then it must be cool! Only by attending seminars, was I able to become more open to different perspectives on how to live a more energetic life. I was exposed to a different way of life and different tools for living and working a more authentic life. The first time I started to meditate was at the end of a three-day speed wealth seminar. At the end of the first day, the audience was tired. (Fifteen-hour days tend to take it out of you!) The speaker told us that, before we left, we all needed to put our notes away and relax in our chairs. He then told us to close our eyes and put our hands on our laps. (I must admit I did peek around to see if everyone had their eyes closed. The majority did.) I decided to give it a go in the spirit of taking it seriously and giving 100% effort in this fifteen-hour day. We were relaxed, and then music started playing. The speaker told us to relax and forget about the day. We were clearing our minds and entering a relaxed state of mind. The music (or alpha beats) was great. I could hear the sound of a waterfall and forgot that I was in a room with over 2,000 other people. I felt like I was back in Brazil backpacking, which was one of the greatest times in my life. This meditation practice was an out-of-body experience. It took about fifteen minutes before the speaker counted to ten slowly and clicked his fingers. We all woke up in the room and felt like doing another fifteen-hour day immediately. It was amazing and I wanted more of it. Was this a special event? Or did all the other top motivational speakers, business people, authors and sales gurus in the world use meditation to achieve their goals, too? The reality is that they all listen to meditation almost every day! So this got me curious and I wanted to understand what meditation was all about. “Meditation is the tongue of the soul and the language of our spirit.” - Jeremy Taylor (English Anglican, Clergyman, Writer and Bishop, 1613–1667) Archaeologists found ancient Indian scriptures which detailed the practice of meditation. The earliest recorded writings of meditation are over 5,000 years old. It is a well-documented practice of many world religions including Buddhism, Christianity, Hinduism, Islam, Jainism, and Judaism. Meditation is now practiced throughout the world by millions of people on a daily basis. So what is meditation? It is the single most important self-development and wellness practice known to mankind. Meditation is the art of being without control. When you think about it, we control our brain every day, right? Doesn’t that get tiring? Meditation lets your brain do what it wants for a change. It’s a bit like parent-teacher meetings. While the teacher was talking to our parents, we got to play in the corner. How fun was that? So meditation lets our brain go quiet while we play over in the corner. We don’t quiet the mind with meditation. We achieve a state of bliss and the mind goes silent. This leads to an incredibly peaceful and happy state of being. I saw a beautiful photo of an astronaut floating in space above the earth recently, and this really depicts what meditation feels like to me. Meditation lets you tune out the world and “get into the zone.” The zone is where you completely shut out the world and become immersed in your inner world. The zone is achievable by anyone and it goes beyond focus — it’s a complete merging of physical reality and imagination. Athletes get in the zone all the time; so do artists, musicians, inventors, and anyone else who has had to integrate an idea with a physical application. I remember one evening when I was studying in school for exams, and I got into the zone. It was quite an experience. I was completely focused on the task at hand without any distractions whatsoever. When I meditate, I feel like that astronaut in the photo. My mind is calm. I read a great article revently called Discover Meditation by Shelley Costello, and she sums up meditation by saying “The mind and I become immersed with my true essence — my true self that is one with all. I feel like I have the path to all wonder and the gate to the essence of everything. I merge with the silence, the stillness, and the tranquility of the present moment. It is total inner peace. I achieve self-awareness, which gives me clarity, creativity, and a deep sense of true purpose that is simply just being.” Meditation is a practice where we can realize benefits such as developing compassion, love, patience, generosity, forgiveness, and an indestructible sense of well-being while engaging in any and all of life’s activities. Meditation quiets the brain so we are able to focus on and broadcast the message of our goals and visions. John Assaraf says that meditation makes us better attuned to receive the answers, tools, and resources we need to fulfill that vision. It accomplishes this by developing our capacity to modulate and regulate the different frequencies of brainwaves emitting. With meditation, we can acquire an awareness of whom and what we really are. We can tune in to finer signals and pick up information crucial to helping us achieve our goals when we meditate and escape from our frenetic pace. Meditation is all about just being and doing nothing. So how does this benefit someone looking to set and achieve goals? “Through meditation and by giving full attention to one thing at a time, we can learn to direct attention where we choose.” - Eknath Easwaran (Author and Spiritual Teacher, 1910–1999) Mental discipline (the Law of Attraction) and meditative practice changes the workings of the brain and allows people to achieve different levels of awareness and peacefulness. Here are the top four benefits that I have realized by meditating: 1. Reduced Stress Levels The number one benefit of meditation is stress reduction. I often become stressed due to work and personal problems. The deep level of physical relaxation brought about by meditation allows me to rest and easily digest the events of the day. I have learned that tissue repair and regeneration can only happen when the body is in a relaxed state. I discovered that when I become stressed, the sympathetic nervous system continually dumps stress hormones into the system as a defense mechanism. This gets worse in the long term if it is not treated. The only way to permanently get rid of excess stress is to meditate. I exercise a lot, too, which is a great stress reducer, but it does not create the right mindset. I learned that stress is a choice, meaning that when I have mastery over my mind, I choose my emotional response to any situation. I choose whether to be upset or to let it go. Meditation changes my state of mind from a negative one to a positive one. Quite often, stress impacts my mental functioning and my emotional state. Sometimes I am unable to concentrate and struggle to find that creative spark. Other times, I can’t think straight and can’t remember stuff. This is all because of stress and an inability to switch my emotions. Stress also clouds my mental processes. When I’m worried about something, I can’t devote my full focus to my goals because I have too much on my mind. I know that I need to quiet my mind (and, ultimately, my stress levels) to allow me to focus my thoughts on my goals. According to John Assaraf, meditation literally physically changes our brain. The longer we meditate, the more grey matter we gain (capacity), and the more we increase the thickness of our cerebral cortex (speed). I noticed that when I was using the Law of Attraction to think positive thoughts, some days I would be cruising along just fine, only to have some random event trigger negative thoughts. Meditation removes that stress and gives me the strength to step back from any situation, see it from a new point of view, choose my response, and not let it control me. Meditation cements the work done by using the Law of Attraction on a daily basis. 2. Increased Happiness and Self-Esteem Meditation has helped build my self-confidence by positively influencing my mood and helping me to overcome bad habits. It has helped me rise above minor issues and frustrations by allowing me to see the bigger picture. It has facilitated me in developing self-mastery to become a more compassionate person with better listening skills, and the ability to see multiple points of view. This has had an amazing effect on my sales calls, because I can now focus 100% on my client’s world instead of my own, which allows me to build trust in an authentic and compassionate way. I have learned the art of forgiveness and understanding of myself and others, as well as learning to accept myself. This is wisdom that I know I will carry with me for the rest of my life. I have an improved attitude and ability to live in the present day. This is helping boost my life experience and helping me realize clarity with my goals. It has increased my job satisfaction because I now value my impact in my sales role. I view what I do as my gift to the world; it is my message. Meditation has definitely improved my social skills and social behaviors including helping my presentation skills and making it so I am not so nervous when presenting to large groups. (I still find this a bit daunting but I know that, by practicing meditation, it will become a lot easier!) I find myself worrying and obsessing less about the little things in life that sometimes get us down. T. Harv Eker has a saying, “You can be right or you can be rich.” What that means to me is that when there is a problem, we always play the blame game and focus on who was wrong, not on how to solve the problem. We have all done it. I used to have agendas to prove that I was right. If you do that you can never be rich. (Being rich does not specifically mean money. I take this to mean being rich spiritually, mentally, physically, and emotionally — not necessarily your bank balance, but your life balance.) Now I focus on the problem, and not who is wrong or right. 3. Increased Energy Levels In the book, “The Answer,” John Assaraf says that “everything in the physical world is made out of atoms. Atoms are made out of energy. Energy is made out of consciousness.” Meditation relaxes my mind (conscious and subconscious) and has increased my ability to perform at my absolute peak of potential, both mentally and physically. I remember seeing a footballer named Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink in the tunnel before a major football game. He had his headphones on and was completely tuned out to the world. He was going within, summoning his most intense focus and finding the hidden reserves of strength, endurance, and willpower that he knew lay in his mind. He had a great game that day and his team won the match. I have become so much more aware of my thoughts. I am learning to just listen and not get involved in any thought. I am letting it float by. The tone of my thoughts is now mostly optimistic, focusing on abundance, ease, and flow. My mind typically focuses on just a few main topics, so I don’t worry about the random thoughts. Whenever negative thoughts appear, I go through the process of changing the quality of those thoughts with consistent and persistent effort. It takes time and practice. I am now willing to do the mental work so that I can start creating new mental habits. Whenever I worry and experience negative emotions, I redirect my thoughts. I create and visualize what I want instead of what I don’t want by focusing on the positive instead of the negative. I do this as often as possible so that I can reprogram my mind to think in a more positive way. This influences my actions and ultimately my results. T. Harv Eker spoke about how we shower and brush our teeth every day. Well, meditation is like a shower for the mind. It needs to be done every day. 4. Increased Creativity Meditation allows for greater access to one’s imagination, which allows for greater creativity in problem-solving, achieving goals, and ease of staying in the solution. Meditation has increased my capacity for learning. Since listening to meditation music, I have noticed an increase in my creativity in terms of coming up with good ideas in my sales presentations. I feel like those people with light bulbs over their heads in the cartoons! Sometimes we struggle to find the answers we are looking for. Perhaps you are writing and looking for an example to talk about or you are writing a proposal for a business tender and are stuck on a certain aspect of it. This is the perfect time to take a break, find somewhere quiet, and listen to some meditation music. The answers will come. You might be asking yourself: “How do I meditate?” “Work is not always required. There is such a thing as sacred idleness.” - George MacDonald ( Author and Poet, 1824 –1905) The true principle of meditation is to elevate your mind to a state of pure self-awareness. It is a good idea to have a meditation space. This can be a room or some part of your home where you feel the most comfortable. All you need to do is put on your headphones and relax — on the couch or wherever you prefer! I normally sit in my office chair in the morning and lay down on my bed in the afternoon. I aim to meditate twice a day. Place your hands wherever they feel comfortable; one on top of the other in your lap, in a mudra position, with the tip of the thumb touching the tip of the first or middle finger to form a circle, or if you prefer, simply place them on your thighs — whatever is comfortable and feels right for you. Close your eyes and begin to focus your attention on your breath. Stress makes your breathing shallow and rapid. Focusing on the exhale and gently emptying your lungs will quickly relax you. Let out a long sigh and feel the stress leaving your body with each breath. Let your breath come naturally and feel your body and mind relax as your breathing slows and deepens. Breathe in through the nose and exhale through the mouth. Create a mental image of the breath as it enters your body through the nose, circulates in your lungs and exits the body through the mouth. It never stops for more than a few seconds. Feel the eternity in each breath! Some meditation tapes say to give your breath a colour. As you relax, your breath will deepen and slow down. It becomes so quiet and gentle as your body relaxes. If you get caught up in a train of thought, bring your focus back to the music or your breath. Ignore thoughts as much as you can, and when you can’t, refocus on what you want. Practice this until it becomes easy. Imagine that your eyes are being given a massage. This helps you focus and you can then start concentrating on bringing the energy from your toes, all the way up through the body, and eventually to your head. After this, it is good to focus on someone else. Think about one or two people who you were not nice to on a particular day or that you said something wrong to, and give them all of your positive energy. We can only help ourselves by helping others. Next, use visualization. Start with a picture of your goal as already achieved in the future, and work back to the present. Imagine the steps that you would have taken to get from where you are now to where you want to be. Train yourself to visualize some of the goals that you are going to achieve! This takes practice, but over time it will get easier and easier. Imagine your goal being accomplished. How do you feel? What does it look like? It can be things like scoring a goal in football, taking a holiday, closing a sales deal or helping a friend in need, etc. It is a good idea to smile through this visualization. It is impossible to feel stressed and bad when you have a genuine smile. I make intentions and create what I would like to bring into my life. I don’t use a teacher to meditate and I don’t think that you need one either. It is a process of self-mastery. You just need to commit to doing it every day for a week. I start the day with a morning meditation of fifteen minutes. If you get up fifteen minutes earlier than you normally do and immediately go meditate, you set the tone for the day and gently bring your mind and your body into an alert state. You decide how your day is going to be. Meditation, coupled with the Law of Attraction, means that you can achieve a state of bliss with your day. Morning meditation helps create a meditation habit. In the morning, your mind isn’t quite fired up yet in terms of worry and fear. This makes it easier to experience a quiet mind, empty of all thought. Your body is still in a relaxed state and you will find it easier to meditate. In the morning, you decide whether to be positive or negative. The evenings are traditionally a time of reflection and gratitude. I love coming home after work and listening to meditation music for fifteen minutes as well. If you have a stressful day, all you have to do is put on your headphones and the mental chatter goes away. When you wake up, it feels like a new day. I recommend meditating at both times of the day, but whatever you feel is right for you is right for your practice! Meditation has given me great power and energy, recharging the whole system on all levels: spiritual, emotional, and physical. It has allowed me to eliminate mental chatter and make restlessness a non-issue. Do you want to experience deep, tranquil, uninterrupted meditation at the push of a button? It’s easy! I use Omharmonics’ meditation audio every day and it is perfect if you are only beginning your meditation journey. I started using it because it makes it easy for beginners. No special skills are required when you use Omharmonics. Just put on your headphones, press play, and you’re off to a wonderful state of bliss!

Inauguration Eve Anxiety,"It’s the eve of inauguration day and I’m starting to get the same feeling in my stomach I had on election night. It’s a mixture of disbelief, anxiety, and restlessness. It’s a strange time. I am bidding farewell to the man who has been the president of the United States for my entire adult life. Who has set an example in his tone and demeanor, in the manner in which he speaks, in the way he treats others, and who consistently sought to be inclusive during his tenure as president. I’m sad to see Barack Obama go. I’m sadder to see who the country has replaced him with. Say what you want about his policies, whether you agree or disagree, but the man handled himself with class and decorum at all times. I was watching the news recently and the pundits were talking about the John Lewis versus Trump situation. Something one of the pro-Trump pundits said left a bad taste in my mouth (beyond the usual). She said “why does the president-elect have to be the bigger man?” Excuse me, what do you mean by why? He’s about to hold the highest office in the land. The way the president handles himself matters. Being calm, cool, and collected amidst adversity matters. Learning how to take an insult in stride is a valuable and necessary skill for a public official, more so for the president. Also, that’s a terrible perspective to hold when it comes to our elected officials. Why should they be the bigger person should not be a sentiment echoed in regards to the people we’ve chosen to lead us. It seems obvious to me that elected officials should strive to be generous in spirit, open to voices of dissent, and able to engage in dialogue without descending into insults like is customary for our president-elect. This really should not be a revolutionary concept. We hold school children to higher standards. I remember the day after Meryl Streep spoke at the Golden Globes, a coworker told me with absolute disgust in her voice, that she used to love her, but no longer did, that not everything needed to be about politics. I figured Trump supporters wouldn’t like what she said. But had she spoken those same words at another moment in history, during a separate election cycle, would those same Trump supporters really have had an adverse reaction to it? Meryl Streep during her speech said: “Disrespect invites disrespect. Violence incites violence. When the powerful use their position to bully others, we all lose.” Is that really a political statement? Can you objectively find fault in that? And if you do, why? It’s been such a stark contrast to listen to Obama’s farewell speech and then Trump’s press conference. Even as he’s leaving office, the president gives me hope. Not yet in power, Trump’s almost every utterance fills me with hesitation and uneasiness. It’s a surreal contrast. And tomorrow the transition will be official. When I got home today, I turned on the TV just in time to watch Trump and the future first family all standing in front of the statue of Lincoln. It was a strange visual. I wonder what he thought while he was standing there. Yeah, I’m going to have one of these made of myself, but in gold, it’ll be great, so great, believe me. I should probably do it via executive order, I’m the president, I can do that kinda stuff. Maybe he looked at Lincoln and thought no way his hands were that big, my statue’s hands are going to be yuuuge. Who knows. The country isn’t as divided as it was during Lincoln’s presidency, but damn it feels like its ready to split at the seams right now. We’ve elected a caricature to be the leader of the free world, and I’m treating it the same way I deal with hurricanes. Hope for the best, prepare for the worst. May God bless the United States of America… for all our sakes.",2017
Living with Anxiety,"I am an adolescent who suffers from anxiety everyday. My first panic attack occurred in grade nine during gym class. I was overwhelmed by the thought of high school. I sat on a chair and began to over analyze how my life would look like in the next 10 years and shortly after, I suddenly let out a huge cry and threw myself to the ground. All I could think of was dying and the urge of how sweet death appealed to be in my mind at that moment. Every moment, every second made me crave death even more. I wanted the pain to consume me and for my lungs to reject any oxygen from entering into them. I do not know what made me feel that way. Anger? Fear? I still cannot understand what I wanted or hoped from this. This was my first introduction to anxiety and I had no idea that would be embarking a back and forth journey for years to come. It has been 4 years since the attack. I still have moments where I feel like my body just wants to shut off and stop responding. I began to occupy myself by applying to jobs and working to avoid being alone at any given second. However, as time went by, I found the anxiety just getting worse and worse. Self- hatred, shock, uncontrollable anger and many other emotions rushed through me as I began to face new symptoms I had never been exposed to before. Sleep deprivation was one of the main issues I had to fight constantly because lack of sleep really limited my daily interactions and activities. It was time to reach out for help. I began seeing a counselor in my high school to help me really understand my problem. She said that I suffer from Generalized Anxiety Disorder and Panic Disorder. Basic information about the disorders I was coping with gave me clarity and immediately aided with some of the extreme symptoms. I began to see a psychologist every three weeks or so to help focus on my breathing, meditating, positive self-talk and other coping methods that began to help immediately. The reason why I have shared my story with you is because I want to show that it really just takes one step to change your life tremendously and quickly. You are never alone in this battle and many others also endure anxiety. It is nothing to be ashamed about. In fact, many of us experience anxiety in many forms on a daily basis, but for some, like me, it is a bit more extreme. I have embraced my mental illness and am proud of it. I have become stronger and more tolerant as an individual. I have also learnt a lot about the psych mind and how it plays a vital role in your health. I now take my mental health more seriously than before. If you do experience any form of discomfort, self- hatred, constant anger just know that it is never to late to seek help. Remember, reach out for help and educate yourself on tools and concepts to improve your quality of life and coping skills. This is my story. It is simple and short and not as descriptive as I wish I could be, but I hope it helps anyone out there who is being timid about their anxiety. It is something a lot of people deal with but it is often hidden. Embrace it. Own it. Change your life. It is all in your control.",2017
DAYS I HAVEN’T MET CHARLIE BROOKER,"The Limit - Fastest Day - Day 220 The following takes place in my mind. It’s how I reacted after tagging people on my first 3 Tweets. Dude, you have no idea how much I hate doing that. The anxiety inside of me goes berserk every time I receive a notification about my Twitter account. It’s like being ashamed of being your own self. Like wishing to be dead simply because you can’t deal with strangers’ responses. I’m getting a bit overboard here. Anyway, here goes nothing: First tweet. Nothing. Hum, I best do something else now. I can’t. Dear God, I’ll look at that in a few minutes. Will I? I don’t know, I’m afraid of doing it now. I got it, I’ll wait 1 hour and a half, then I’ll open my e-mail or something, so I’ll have no other choice but to immediately check what were the results and post my second tweet. What time is it? A full hour passed already?!?!!?! The fuck! It’s pathetic how time flies unbelievably fast when anxiety is against you. Good anxiety, you’re stuck in time forever; bad anxiety, you’re there faster than that Spaceballs ship-speed. Dude, better stop thinking about it, otherwise it will be time to check and post a…it’s time. Fuck me. Second tweet. All of them responded. Jeebus, according to my e-mails they’ve all liked what I’ve written but only one of them responded. I’ll wait like before to see what it is…is it a good response? That’s highly unlikely. I feel like going to the restroom and letting everything inside me out. Backdoor. All of it. Just out. I’ll go and do that. Still, it will probably cost me about 20 minutes — Yeah, I’m one those people, I don’t care. After those 20, plus the other 20 you already wasted thinking about tagging Charlie on the next tweet, you won’t have much time left to “distract” yourself with silly things as planned. God, I do need to use the toilet though. Guess I’ll have that in mind in case I don’t go, which is sort of a distraction… Third tweet. Nothing. That’s it, you can finally go peacefully to the restroom and check their responses later, if there’s any. Think I’ll check it tonight only, pretend I went to the cinema or something. Day 220, Charlie. Fastest, yet anxiously painful, day of my life.",2017
10 Ways to Change Your Life (in Under 5 Minutes),"A big life change is a bit like a marathon: you need to prepare yourself for it beforehand, or it likely won’t end very well, or at least, according to plan. So, without further ado: here are ten simple ways to change your life (in under 5 minutes): Dehydration is responsible for a whole load of horrible symptoms. if you find yourself getting headaches Often, feeling tired during the day and not going to the toilet that often (yep, dehydration also causes constipation), it’s likely due to not drinking enough water. A good guideline is for around 2 liters a day — and more in hot weather. There’s nothing worse than feeling rushed in the morning, especially if you’ve overslept. One, simple life-changing hack, is to get as much as you can ready the night before. It’s guaranteed to be less stressful and keep you more organised — as well as the added bonuses of anxiety-free sleep and a few more minutes in bed in the morning. Cabin Fever is the feeling of irritability and restlessness from being inside for too long. Everyone’s Cabin fever-limits are different; however one very quick and easy to way to clear your head and get into the life-changing mood is to go outside, even for a short period of time. While the problems linked to too much smartphone use have been written about continuously over the past few years, most of us still refuse to pay any attention. Eye strain, disrupted sleep and feeling low are just a very small sample of what overuse can do in an incredibly short period of time, and that’s before we even touch on the dangers of phone addiction — which is another topic, for another day. As with the last point, setting boundaries between ‘work’ time and ‘rest’ or leisure time has become more difficult in the past few years. Whether it’s working with international people or companies, a boss who emails you after you’ve left the office, or an urgent project you just need to get done, not ‘switching off’ becomes more difficult once it becomes a pattern or a habit. Remember, no one on their death bed ever says that they wished they had worked longer hours, or harder! Hot showers have magical powers. Even if it’s hot outside, a hot shower is still a great idea — the hot water equals your hot body temperature inside and cools you down once you finish. And obviously, who doesn’t love a bit of time to themselves, getting clean and letting their mind wander…? Caffeine has its benefits and its drawbacks, and while a little bit of it is a good metabolism booster, drinking more than one cup of coffee a day is most likely too much. Too much caffeine can overload your system — so you might feel really wired and energetic for a while, before that feeling is pulled like a ripcord, and you come crashing down off the caffeine high. If you need a good hot drink to substitute — go for herbal teas, particularly green teas, which include antioxidants, and are proven to boost your digestion and lower your blood pressure. If you love your carbs but always feel bloated after eating them, it’s probably because of the type of carbs you’re eating. White carbs, such as white breads, pastas and rices, are highly processed — meaning they are bleached and treated, so that when you eat them, your body absorbs them quickly, producing your blood sugar to spike…and then come crashing down. Not only does this leave you feeling bloated, but it also means you feel hungry pretty soon afterwards. It’s better to switch to brown carbs and less processed foods, which the body absorbs more slowly, meaning you feel better during the digestions process and are fuller for longer. It’s pretty self-explanatory, but simply put — we are social creatures, designed to want and need to be around people. The longer you lack meaningful social interactions — that is, with people you are relaxed and comfortable around, not the colleague you say hi to at lunch occasionally — the worse you will start to feel. If you’re really not feeling like you can go out and see people, or that you don’t have time, arrange to do a flying meet up at a nearby location, or have them come to you. A 5 minute chat or a cup of (herbal) tea is better than nothing at all — and it will encourage you to do it more often. Sleep Hygiene is the practice of having a good night’s sleep, and what it takes to make sure you do. As mentioned throughout this post, keeping a smartphone/laptop/device in your bedroom with you is a very bad idea. Electronic devices emit ‘blue light‘, which disturbs your sleep due to the light and radio waves. Sleeping properly can change your whole day, and even strengthen your immune system (again, this is a topic I’ll be delving into more in depth in another post), and if you’re an anxious sleeper or insomniac, training your body with a regular bedtime routine is the best way to get you sleeping like a baby once the routine kicks in. It’s a good idea to read up on sleep hygiene, and I’ve even written a post about it. And there you have it — easy, 5 minute life hacks — which, when followed properly, can change your life and get you prepared for anything. I hope it’s helped! What do you think about this list?

Do Something For You Today #3,"When I worked full time in a large YMCA gym, I remember how blissful it felt at the end of a shift to turn off the radio. Quiet. My ears were grateful for the reprieve. I still like to sit and be still and absorb the quiet. More than that, I like to listen without effort. If you wish, you can try this little exercise now: Sit still, with no music on, and talk to no one. Read nothing. Then, ever so gently, pay attention to the sounds you can hear and do so without effort. There is no need to ‘try’ to hear the sounds. Isn’t it interesting that a lot of the time we ‘strain’ to hear things and there is no need to do that because all the sounds have already reached our ears and have already been processed by our brain. We need only to listen without effort. For me, listening without effort feels like this: As I exhale slowly, I relax my brow, flatten out my eye lids and soften the muscles at the back of my neck. I allow my ears to slide a little down my scalp (I don’t know if this is actually happening, but it feels like it) and drop my shoulders down slightly, allowing any unnecessary tension to drop away and welcome instead the necessary opposite of tension. I keep my face smooth and unwrinkled and soften my jaw, allowing the teeth to part slightly as I then allow myself to simply ‘hear’ the sounds around me. By ‘hearing’, I mean simply acknowledging what is already reaching my ears and brain. Listening without effort is a gift to my body. Perhaps you can sit in the quiet of life, unplug your music, unplug your thinking for a time and listen to the world around you. Without effort.",2017

How A List Changed My Life,"Yes, it sounds ridiculous, but a list — written in blue pen on the back of a store receipt — really did change my life. It happened exactly as I just described it above — I wrote a list and it changed my life. For the hows and the whys — you need to know a bit of background: I was alone, exhausted and miserable. I couldn’t sleep, and was constantly on edge, unable to feel anything. If I could have disappeared into thin air, I would have taken the opportunity. I was stuck in a rut. I didn’t know how to cope, or why this had happened, but I knew it wasn’t going to end very well. At the time, I was a high school teacher, and I loved working with my students. During the day, I was a high-functioning, high-energy teacher; in the evenings and at weekends, I wouldn’t know what to do with myself. I’d be so lonely and lacking in energy — I started to hate myself and everyone else for being able to feel normal and happy. I’d go days forgetting to eat or not feeling hungry, and then binge on ridiculous amounts of chocolate to try and make myself feel better and — you guessed it — it made me feel even worse than before. Because who would take me seriously? This was all in my head, right? So why couldn’t I just try to cheer up a little? Depression and Anxiety are difficult to describe. They’re even more difficult to talk about, and even if I had wanted to, I felt I had nowhere to turn. I couldn’t talk to my friends — I’d gradually lost touch with most, and the few that were left had their own, serious issues to deal with. How could I so selfishly discuss my problems with them — when mine were self-made and fake, and theirs were very real and physical? After some time, it all finally broke. I ended up staying at home for two weeks, during which I didn’t leave the house once. I called work and told them I was unwell. I switched my phone off. Noone came looking for me or contacted me. And being at my lowest point, alone, filled with sadness, allowed me to take a hard look at my life — something I hadn’t been able to do with all the noise around me. Every time I had tried to work out why I was unhappy, I got lost in my thoughts. So, I decided to work backwards — starting with my end goal — to be happy. From there, I had a whole plan of things to do — ‘actionable items’ — which would get me to my ultimate goal. It didn’t happen overnight, but eventually, I got there. And beyond. After a while not only did I feel happy, healthy and better than ever before — but making myself happy proved to me that I was capable of achieving anything. That is, anything I wanted to, given I had planned it the right way and embraced any and every setback. The path to positive change is anything but easy — but each achievement is totally worth it.

The Type of Mood Where You Want to Punch Someone in the Face,"And also, your coworker comes by and tells you kind of bad news about the future of your job and so your anxiety is on extra high and you want to punch someone in the face and if anyone asks you if you’re going to a women’s march one more time you actually will punch them in the face? And, oh yeah, today is the inauguration, and you’ve been awake since 5 AM for no reason at all other than your brain couldn’t stop thinking of stuff even though you really wanted to sleep and when you texted your boyfriend around 8 AM looking for sympathy he gave you exactly none. So then you decide to go for a walk to get food you really don’t need and a cappuccino, which you also really don’t need, but it’ll be a welcome distraction and, who knows, maybe extra caffeine will have a calming effect today? So you get there and order and then realize you forgot your wallet at home and you have exactly $3 in cash on you, which is not enough for food and cappuccino, so you say, “Shit!” quite loudly to the point where you think you offended the pleasant people around you in the coffee shop, but luckily the barista is nice enough or feels bad enough for you (definitely the latter) that he lets you slide since you’re a local and will be back or else they’ll hunt you down. And so you walk back to your office feeling no better, and perhaps even worse than you did before, and so you write it all down because that’ll be more productive than moping about it in your head. Ever feel that way? No? Me neither.",2017
I Found Hope For The Future in An Uber,"Yesterday, I had a panic attack on the Q Train. I, like everyone else around me, was trying not to think about the Inauguration. That just mere hours ago, a president we trust and respect was replaced with one that we fear and loathe. I was on my way to have dinner with a boss and friend of mine, Amber, that I knew would make me feel safe as a fellow queer person and hater of Trump. But in that moment on the train, I felt so alone. Hands shaking, I took off my hat to help cool myself down a bit, and closed my eyes as I tried to immerse myself in a safer space meditation my therapist had taught me. But the jolts of the train kept breaking my concentration. “Would you like to sit?” a lady seated in front of me with a puffy coat and tote bag asked me. Surprised by her kindness and her noticing of my pain, I nodded vigorously thanking her as I took her seat. She stood over me, my protector, as I coached myself through my panic. Once I got to Amber’s house, I felt like I could breathe again. We chatted and ate a delicious dinner she made us, mostly avoiding the negative topics. On most days, this would feel helpful. But as I left her apartment, waiting for the Uber she so generously ordered me, the weight of having not talked about it began to crush me. My partner was out of town and my friends mostly didn’t want to talk about it (who could blame them?). But more than anything, I longed to hear something hopeful from someone who doesn’y share an identity with me. The weight of a new and unsure era in our country burdened me as I stepped into my cab. The driver immediately made a joke with me about my name, and loudly called me “sweetie” and “girl.” He was a middle aged white guy with a plaid flannel, red vest, and a thick Brooklyn accent. He gesticulated wildly, spoke loudly, and looked back at me for responses to his jokes. I shut down at this obnoxious behavior , feeling my anxiety coming back. As I watched the traffic pile up between Brooklyn and Manhattan, I shuddered to think of how and when he could hurt me. We rode in silence for about a half hour as Rachel Maddow ranted about Donald Trump over the radio. As we sat at what must have been the 50th red light, the driver turned to me and asked “you don’t like trump, do you?” I worried about how to word my reaction since, by the looks of him, he seemed like a quintessential “Make America Great Again” type of guy. My subtle response elicited a neutral and “we have to stay positive” response from my driver. But as the minutes rolled on, we both slowly let down our guard. Before I knew it, my driver was filling up over how much he would miss Obama in office, punctuating each proclamation with “man” in his thick Brooklyn accent. He apologized for being so emotional. So instead, I broke my silence and engaged wholeheartedly in this rant with him. We yelled about everything Obama has done right, about his speaking style being one of the best of any president, and the racism he had to go through. My driver kept calling him “a class act.” I was surprised all over again when my driver proclaimed that white men ruined this election and this country. As we slowly felt out one another’s ideologies, we moved on to why we hate Trump. He practically screamed over the idea of Trump overturning Roe v. Wade and gay marriage, pontificating that “religion should not get mixed with politics, I don’t believe in that shit!” He excused himself a lot for swearing. I surprised myself and told him I was queer and engaged. He got emotional at the thought of my rights being taken away, and how stupid it is for people to judge others on things about their identity that they can’t control. “I think that’s the right way to think, right? Many of my customers don’t agree with some of this.” I nodded, tears welling in my eyes. “You’re definitely right.” As we turned onto East 42nd St, my driver told me his dream ticket for the next election. Counting them out on his fingers, he said, “Joe Biden, Bernie Sanders, Michelle Obama, and there’s one other lady. Guess.” He looked back at me at our last red light together, his three fingers held in midair. “Elizabeth Warren,” I said. “Yes!” He loudly proclaimed, giving me a high five. “I knew you would know it.” As my driver pulled up to Grand Central, my heart ached at the idea of never seeing this man again, of ending this magical conversation. But because of him, a random middle-aged white guy from Brooklyn who shared all of my beliefs, my faith in my future felt generously restored. I struggled to find how to say goodbye to him as he grabbed my hand for a handshake. “It was lovely talking to you,” he said with a smile. “Stay proud of who you are!” Flustered at this kind comment, I said my goodbyes, gathered my bags and headed to my train. I found myself crying a bit on my way to the station, taking such comfort in the kindness of strangers. I never thought I could feel so validated by a man that I don’t know. By any man at all, for that matter. I reflected on the lady on the Q, Amber, the Uber driver and yet another lady in a subway station earlier that day (she covered my metro card for me after seeing my hands were shaking too hard to insert my cash into the machine). Even in the chaos of America under Trump, even in the busy, anxiety-inducing city, there are people who are inherently good and caring. And while I left my house feeling exposed and hated as a poor and chronically ill trans person in America, I came back feeling wholly seen, loved and like there is still endless hope in this world for hope and change. No matter who our president is, we still have each other.",2017
A Guide to Suffering: Anticipation,"Suffering is instructive. That’s the mantra. No matter what you endeavor, if it’s a departure from your script you can guarantee that discomfort and perhaps some tough times await. All of that falls under the aegis of suffering. You suffer when you run fast or far. You suffer when you’re laid up in a hospital bed recovering from surgery or an accident. You suffer when you break the icy grip of a bad habit. You suffer when you lose things and people who are close to you. Some suffering is all-consuming and can block out all other sensory inputs; some suffering is annoying like a paper cut. Regardless of the source or volume, we can learn from it. The philosophy behind Suffer Lab is that we can deliberately create situations in our lives that challenge us and, in so doing, force ourselves into situations where we can either grow up or give up. By jostling our spirits with episodic, low-end suffering we become what Nassim Nicholas Taleb describes as Anti-fragile. We become less prone to physical, moral and spiritual injury and in the transformation we can also learn to emotionally detach ourselves from obstacles and see them for what they are. We can reluctantly accept failure to achieve our goals because the process is where the true growth and transformation takes place. Ask any reformed smoker how many times it took them to quit before they kicked the habit. Just as much, we can be successful in reaching our goals, but we shouldn’t lose sight of the rocky path we struggled along to make it. You may not have noticed, but that’s where the real changes happened. Developmental suffering is part of a growth process when it’s deliberate. In the series I’ve entitled “A Guide to Suffering” I’ll present the four walls that make up a Suffer Lab: Anticipation, Acknowledgement, Action, and Assessment. Yeah they all start with A’s, wanna fight about it? But they also share another common element — they place the cerebral ahead of the physical and the tangible. To borrow from Gym Jones: The mind is primary. We begin with anticipation. Where the meditative aspect of anticipation aids in developing a hypothesis for how we’ll respond to stress, meaningful physical practice refines our assumptions leading up to the event. Anticipation is more than passing acknowledgement that you’re going to depart your comfort zone — this is arguably the most important phase. We can barter away a great deal of the fear, tension, or anxiety we may feel prior to and during an event by living it several times over in our minds. We can mentally brace for the hunger, thirst, and other deprivations experienced during prolonged exertion. This is more than just planning. Anticipation involves mentally assembling all the actions within your plan, stepping in and out of them, playing the event in your head and making note of where all this will send your mind and body. You’ll miss a few things and there’s things you just can’t anticipate. This is what is referred to as “friction” in warfare. Anticipation requires its student to surrender pretension and hubris. You’re not Superman and you have limits. Spend some time meditating on your weakness (trust me, it’s there) and you’ll be that much better prepared for your event and damn if you won’t learn a thing or two about yourself in the process. Consider the use of imagery in this phase. Place yourself at mile 45 when you’re hungry and you just want to stop. Place yourself in the pre-dawn when you haven’t had a chance to sleep in 18 hours. Put yourself at your desk staring down the exam booklet waiting for the professor to say “begin”. What will you be wearing during the job interview? How will you walk from your car to the race registration tent? Imagine the smells and the temperature. What will you be hearing? Get good at this and do it often. Use of mental imagery in this way is common among athletes, acrobatic pilots, race car drivers, and several other professionals to prepare for activity. Even going back to the Samurai days of medieval Japan where these men sought honor in dying for their master, imagery played a central role: The Way of the Samurai is found in death. Meditation on inevitable death should be performed daily. Every day when one’s body and mind are at peace, one should meditate upon being ripped apart by arrows, rifles, spears, and swords. Being carried away by surging waves. Being thrown into the midst of a great fire. Being struck by lightning, being shaken to death by a great earthquake. Falling from thousand-foot cliffs, dying of disease, or committing seppuku at the death of one’s master. And every day, without fail, one should consider himself as dead. This is the substance of the Way of the Samurai. — Tsunetomo Yamamoto, from “Hagakure” Pretty moto right? This is a little more terminal than we seek to explore in our own Suffer Lab but Tsunetomo’s point was clear: if I meditate on my death — if I live through a thousand of them — then meeting my ultimate purpose in real life is easier to digest. Anticipation biases the cognitive side of things, but there’s something to be said about good old fashioned practice. Where the meditative aspect of anticipation aids in developing a hypothesis for how we’ll respond to stress, meaningful physical practice refines our assumptions leading up to the event. Special Operators will typically do rehearsals and dry runs before a complicated mission. Soccer players scrimmage. Cyclists log miles in the saddle. Students take practice quizzes. In physical practice we also build muscle memory. Cops and soldiers practice drawing and firing their weapon over and over so that when the moment of truth finds them, their minds have one less thing hogging cerebral bandwidth. Okayyy pull out the gun…point it in the direction of the dangerous stuff…look down this sight on the front…aaaandddd I’m squeezing the trigger….shit that’s loud! There’s no time for that. In deliberate suffering we are putting minds and bodies through stress in order to come out stronger and sharper on the other side. Some of these situations involve risk of injury in a dynamic and rapidly changing environment (ever watch the start of a bike race?). Anticipation — mental and physical examination and practice before the event — has an effect not unlike programming a computer. It prepares our minds to efficiently route needed physical and moral responses during stress and in doing so we negotiate away some of the tunnel vision and time-dilation (known as “tachypsychia” in the psychology world) that we experience during stressful situations. Anticipation frees up head space to exercise self-awareness which is a key component of the second phase: Acknowledgement.",2017
"Hello, Anxiety. It’s Me Again.","It was after I had given my first talk in front of an audience filled with familiar faces and faces of strangers that I immediately went into an emotional breakdown. I had felt so much love in those moments, a moment that had only lasted half an hour but felt like a millisecond. I felt my heart race and my head pound as nerves shot through my whole body. With any event or occasion mishaps happen, and I knew that. But it felt like everything that could go wrong, went completely wrong. Maybe it was just me, but I felt so many emotions that once I opened my mouth and words would come out, I honestly couldn’t even recall anything I said or if it made any sense. Then people asked questions and I don’t even know if I even answered them properly. I thought these feelings arrived from the nervousness and the overwhelming moments leading up to my own talk, you know, stage fright. After the talk it was all a blur to me, but my friends assured me I did a great job. I brushed off all of the emotions I’ve held but here I am post talk and the day before a big event I had planned for 3 months crying at my computer trying to put together the final touches of a Coffee & Convos post, but I cannot summon the energy to do so. I’ve battled with anxiety my whole life. And I thought I had handled it well as I’ve dealt with it on my own and in my own silence. I can’t help but wonder, is this how I’m going to feel like the rest of my life? I’m in pursuit of my dreams and these incredibly opportunities have been arriving tenfold to make these dreams a reality and I should be happy! And I really am, I’m the happiest I’ve ever been but the same time I feel like I’m missing something. I feel like I’m on the road to building my happiness and success, but with that comes these road blocks of feelings I can’t describe of sadness and heartache that are all just things made up in my head. I’ve gone through this before and I thought after I’ve overcome these feelings in the past that it would be easier to deal with if it were to occur again. I was wrong. I feel broken. And honestly, I’m fucking terrified. I don’t want to feel like this all the time. I don’t want to have these fears and doubts and feelings of anxiousness and nerves eat at me inside when things in my life are going SO WELL. It’s kind of ironic to me, that my anxiety comes from moments I should be happy about. I guess this is just a reminder to me that I can’t ignore my anxiety. And I have to remind myself that it’s okay to not be okay even when things are pretty fucking okay. These feelings… They’re only temporary. And tomorrow is a new day. And THE day. And it’s an opportunity for me to grow from this.",2017
A Dark Elephant!,"A dark elephant resides inside you, Crawling inside every tiny abyss of your labyrinth, Scarring your breath, And snaring your neck, But to the world you’re liberal of your throes, A bright smile upon the face of day, Perfectly veils the beauty of a stark elephant, Which plays seek and seek with you all the forlorn night; A dark elephant walks with you, Holding your presence on its trunk, But you carry its heavy appetite, And let it sucks your blood, But to the world you’re a human of unruined bone and flesh, The black cowhat upon your head, Perfectly veils your mourning eyes, The elephant keeps hunting you, Until you yourself fall dark upon the face of light; A dark elephant is your friend, Which talks with you, Which dance with you, Which swings with you, Which sleeps with you, Which awakes with you, Which delves with you, And which dissipate with you, Just like an invisible dark elephant, You’re invisible.

I’m tired of being afraid,"Fear is a mother fucker. No matter how many self-help books you read, no matter how deep into philosophy you get, there will always be this tiny side of you with all the “what if’s”. My whole life has been lead — or slowed down — by fear. Fear of stuttering in front of someone, fear of not knowing where my next bucks are coming from, fear of being alone in a world that doesn’t make much sense to me. I read somewhere that you should make yourself feel a little uncomfortable every single day. Even if it’s just a tiny bit. If you let yourself get too comfortable with everything that’s around you, you’re going to be terrified of trying anything new. The only thing that stops us from doing anything, is fear. How many times have you avoided doing something because you were afraid? Afraid of failing, afraid of looking stupid, afraid of doing something that makes you an outsider. I don’t know where I’m headed in life, but my main concern is that I no longer want fear to control my life. Thankfully I’m working on that.",2017
Disconnect,"Spam spam spam spam, spam spam spam spam, Lovely spam, wonderful spam — Trump, Trump Trump Trump . . . . . . . . Where are rhe Pythons when we need them? My morning paper, The Globe and Mail, created the world of the day in its Saturday edition. Today’s editorial suggests we “Keep calm and carry on”. So how does its content this morning help us do that? I decided that it would be fun to put some headlines into a word cloud generator. The result is what you see above and the answer is “Not so much” I restricted my Word Cloud to two sections of the newspaper — “News” and the one called “Focus”, which includes commentary and the weekly editorial. I didn’t have the energy to cut and paste the copy of the articles under these headlines or we would see the word Trump push every other word out of the cloud. Yes, I know that an inauguration is news through I didn’t see it on TV. I don’t generally watch the swearing in of Canadian poliiticians on TV either though I did attend a real-life one the fall and it was moving and made me glad to be a Canadian. But if the fourth estate wants us to keep calm and carry on here in Canada, is it effective to be as obsessed with one person as it seems to be? I don’t need Canadians to be happy about an inauguration. But I don’t need reporters and columnists to encourage me to be as angry or afraid as they are either. I also don’t need them to share their disillusionment or wishful thinking that a new head of government in the country next door would suddenly become presidential. I did feel as though I were being spammed this morning. Reality TV has created this person and the press seem taken in by it more than anyone else. The values that this genre inspires are mixed. I hardly ever watch it though it is a favorite of my young grandsons — unlike their father who used to like shows like Barney Miller or Get Smart at the same age. Sometimes the Reality TV participants in their endless competitions show courage and ingenuity but more often display winner-take-all and to hell with anybody else. If we are expected to keep calm and carry on, we need a press that focuses more on facts and less on the personal fears, obsessions and anxieties of its writers.",2017
How I’ve dealt with my Anxiety,"I’ve suffered from OCD for almost two decades. How has it affected my life? It’s a bit like being mentally crippled, nobody can see it but you’re struggling all the time just to make it through the day. The most beneficial healing method for me has been meditation, I been to three weekend retreats and they’ve each given great healing. I’ve always depended on a strong faith in God and clung to the hope it will get better (it has!). A few years ago I started keeping a journal which allows me to express my anxieties and separate myself from them a little and also pray for healing. Obviously, I’ve been on meds for years, but they just keep the lid on the pot tightly clamped, they do nothing to reduce the heat or release any steam. It’s frustrating how the psychiatric profession has bought into the idea drugs are the answer to everything, they’re not by a long shot. I’ve started teaching meditation to kids now, so I hope the next generation will be given better coping tools than we were. I feel like all the different media they are exposed to is creating a battleground in their minds where they are never good enough, which is the basis of all advertising.",2017
Anxiety Disorders: What Are Your Options?,"Anxiety disorders affect 1 in 4 Canadians at some point in their lives, making anxiety the most common mental illness in Canada. Psychotherapy and benzodiazepine medication are the conventional treatment options for anxiety. However, benzodiazepine drugs carry a high rate of addiction potential, can make people feel sedated, and carry a long list of side effects. So what can be done about anxiety if you want to pursue other treatment options? First and foremost, it’s important to identify the source(s) and trigger(s) of your anxiety. What makes it better or worse? Is it a social setting that triggers a panic attack? A big test that you’re studying for that’s causing general anxiety? The importance of understanding your anxiety, rather than avoiding it, carries with it a significant mental and physical benefit. Our brains have the ability to tell the difference between suppressing our emotions versus addressing and labelling them. It is okay to feel anxious. Learning from our anxieties offers the opportunity for better self-understanding. When we understand why we react with anxiety, we learn from our thoughts, behaviours, and actions. Identify and label how you are feeling and you’ll find that your mood won’t have as much of an impact on your daily function. Proper sleep, a healthy diet, good social support, and a lifestyle that includes plenty of physical activity all factor into your wellbeing when dealing with anxiety. A diet deficient in certain amino acids, vitamins, and/or minerals can have a negative impact on your mental-emotional wellbeing. Certain amino acids, vitamins, and minerals can help to calm an overactive mind through calming your nervous system, and correcting vitamin and mineral deficiencies that might worsen anxiety. In fact, even low iron can contribute to anxiety. An adequate intake of protein from both animal and vegetable sources can help with amino acid intake, and improved blood sugar control. Stable blood sugar levels can be achieved through the consumption of healthy fats like olive oil, coconut oil, avocados, nuts, and seeds. Fibre from fruits and vegetables can stabilize blood sugar, and add vitamins and minerals to your diet. It is important to avoid packaged foods that contain high amounts of simple sugars when trying to control your blood sugar. Lavender is an excellent anti-anxiety herb, acting on your nervous system to calm your body and mind. In trials involving adults with anxiety, lavender was found to be as beneficial as benzodiazepine medication in alleviating feelings of restlessness, and improving sleep. You can even stuff lavender buds in your pillowcases to help with restlessness during the night. Green tea also helps with feelings of anxiety thanks to theanine. It’s an amino acid that can help reduce feelings of stress, promote relaxation, and help with attention. Green tea and lavender are just a couple of the many alternative treatments for anxiety. Other factors that can contribute to anxiety include (but are not limited to): thyroid disease, heart disease, liver disease, kidney disease, digestive diseases, substance abuse, allergies, depression, and other mental illnesses. It’s important to speak with your doctor to determine the underlying factors influencing your individual anxiety, and discuss what treatment alternatives are right for you.",2017
Anxy Dance,"A year ago, Zahra Davidson and I set up @Enrol Yourself. Enrol Yourself is a scaffold for self-directed learning alongside work. This means interdisciplinary groups of people forming via a platform and supported by a coach. Participants sign up for a learning marathon on a subject of their choice and set goals they want to achieve over six months — a 26 week long marathon of the mind! Zahra now runs Enrol Yourself which involves 10 of us setting up businesses and learning new skills on top of our full time jobs, freelance work and running our own organisations. How might movement, writing and performance be used to explore, express and overcome limiting thinking habits? i.e. I’m not good enough This is the question that frames my learning marathon. I chose it because I struggle with anxiety day in, day out. I understand a lot about where it comes from, I recognise its legitimacy at times and get frustrated when it takes over for apparently no reason. We all have an inner critic voice that censors, judges and insults — I’m interested in understanding more about how that blocks connection to ourselves, others and the world. I am exploring this through words and movement because I am curious how words capture the minutiae of personal experience and fascinated by how movement communicates beyond linguistics. I want to learn how our physical imagination can influence our mental imagination and vice versa. What I’m learning I’ve had brilliant conversations with practitioners who’ve helped me take my ideas forward. Quinta, composer and musician reminded me to lean into and trust my own voice; Lucy Brainstow, actor and co-founder at Theatre with Legs gave me a masterclass in performance over a pint and Jessica Johannesson, writer and bookseller challenged me to think about the discipline that comes with building any kind of practice. Last fall I joined Am I a Dancer, a programme that invites non-professional dancers to explore dance through improvisation and interpretation. For our showcase event I made a short solo dance performance about my experience of anxiety. This was a brief glimpse of what it might feel like to explore the theme in front of an audience and a starting point to work from. In the next three months I will build on this piece, working with mentors Vanessa Smith, ex-professional dancer and Feldenkrais practitioner and Jim Ralley, co-founder of flux.am and performance producer. Vanessa is my sounding board as I develop my ideas in movement whilst Jim is asking the tough questions about the practicalities of performance-making. In January, I was selected to work with 23 other artists during a 4-day R&D residential project at the Roundhouse led by director and poet John Berkavitch and choreographer Ed Stephens. This was all-in-all a body-and-mind-boggling experience which you can read more about here. What’s next In February, I’m taking part in the Testing Ground performance workshops at the Conway Hall led by Luke Dixon and Jane Turner, a 4 week dance theatre project with a public performance in March. Together with the Enrol Yourself group, I am also exploring how we can bring our bodies more into our work as a group through movement practices and mindfulness methods. How might we use movement to increase empathy in communication, break down inhibitions, transition to different spaces and ways of working? Thank you The last three months brought to life for me the vital role of the collective in making individual efforts shared, witnessed and integrated in a larger perspective. Huge thanks are due to the Enrol Yourself crew, all our supporters, Am I a Dancer crew, all interviewees who shared their anxieties and practitioners who offered their time, friends and family. And finally, please consider helping us with a donation. We are raising funds for the Advocacy Academy, a transformational Social Justice Fellowship for young people from marginalised communities. Every penny that you can contribute will go directly to The Advocacy Academy — even if we don’t reach our full target.",2017
Sir Kensington and the Quest for the Eternal Flame,"Sir Kensington dreamt of nothing more than to enter into a noble battle. To live up to the legends that had nobly served before him. Each time a battle approached the horizon and the King called forth for a brave Knight, Sir Kensington would tell himself “This is it, this is my battle!” Sure enough though, the evil dragon would stop him. You see, Sir Kensington was cursed with an evil dragon that lived in his mind. It had been there for as long as he could remember. Each time he came close to battle, the dragon would make him feel sick to his stomach. At the same time, he could hear the dragon talking in his head. “Look at you,” the dragon would say with a condescending tone “What a sorry excuse for a knight you are!” With that, the dragon would laugh as Sir Kensington again came to the realization that he would not be able to go into battle. Ashamed, he’d regress back to his quarters, alone and unhappy, filled with the sorrow of disappointing himself and his kingdom yet again. One spring afternoon, his destiny would change forever. Again the king called out, needing a knight to go into battle. Again, Sir Kensington told himself “This is it. This is my battle!” Again, he went running toward the call, then just as quickly the dragon struck by blowing fire into his stomach, causing him to hit the ground in pain. Every part of him felt sick, and weak. So weak. He heard the dragon’s voice again inside of his head “Haha, what kind of knight are you? Pathetic!” He agreed with the dragon, hung his head in shame, and slowly began walking back to his quarters. Along his journey, a friendly voice appeared. “Hello my son, you look like you could use a friend.” Sir Kensington slowly lifted his head up to make eye contact with the noble friar. His kind eyes brought ease to Sir Kensington. To his own surprise, Sir Kensington began to speak. “I am troubled” he said softly. The friar gently placed his hand upon Sir Kensington’s shoulder, and t hen replied, “Please tell me good sir, what troubles you so?” “Well you see, my Lord,” Sir Kensington softly replied, “I want nothing more than to be a noble knight; to be a legend like those before me. However, each time I answer the King’s call, I become physically ill and cannot make it. You see, there is an evil dragon within my mind that makes me ill. And when I cannot fight, he reminds me that I am an awful disappointment.” With that, he bowed his head back down in shame. Surely, the friar would laugh at his poor fortune. The friar, however, remained soft spoken and reassuring “Oh, my son, I am so sorry to hear of your troubles…but I do wonder if you’ve heard of the legend of the eternal flame?” Sir Kensington’s head rose again and with a slight smile he responded “Aye, my Lord, but please do tell it again. It happens to be my favorite.” With that, the friar began the legend. “There once was a fair maiden who was locked away in the highest tower. One night, amongst her despair, she found herself weeping by the only window she had. She slowly opened her eyes, and to her surprise, there was a small flame burning in the distance. It was not a roaring fire, just one single, captivating flame. She rubbed her eyes, and sure enough, it remained. She felt captivated by this flame and it brought her much comfort. Night after night, she returned to the window to admire this flame. One night, a dragon was flying over and stopped in to pay her a visit. “Aye fair maiden!” said the dragon. “Come with me and you’ll never have to be in the tower again.” The maiden knew better then to trust a dragon. She simply ignored his request. Again, he persisted “Fair maiden, come with me and you’ll never be locked away again.” The maiden knew she was much safer in her tower, so she simply ignored his request. But then, one unfortunate evening for the maiden, the dragon saw her flame. He saw her admiring it, and quickly realized that this flame was the key to her happiness. Since he was not able to have her, he came up with an evil plan. The next morning, the dragon informed her that, after she had fallen asleep, he took the flame away to the darkest corner of the darkest cave, so she could never see it again. With that, he flew away. Each night after, she’d desperately look out for her flame, but it never returned. She found herself growing weaker and hopeless. After some time had passed, one unfortunate evening she decided that all hope was lost and made the decision to jump out of the window, to meet her death.” Although Sir Kensington had heard this legend many times before, he still found it rather captivating. After a few moments of reflection, he responded. “Such a sad tale. I wonder what made that flame so powerful, that it brought so much hope to a maiden in despair, and then so much tragedy upon its’ disappearance?” The friar smiled, knowingly, and responded “Son, the eternal flame is within all of us.” Sir Kensington now looked and felt very perplexed. The friar chuckled, and continued, “When the maiden asked for help, her mind actually created that flame to keep her hope alive. Unfortunately, the dark side of her mind created the dragon that convinced her he took it away. She believed her thoughts so much that, her positive ones were able to give her hope each long day in the tower, but her negative ones were so unbearable that they ultimately lead to her death. You see, she did not realize the power she had inside to create that eternal flame, and that flame is in fact eternal, even when our minds try to convince us otherwise.” Sir Kensington was in awe. The friar continued “You, sir, are a knight. You have the heart of a knight and the yearning. You need to see your own eternal flame, it’s in you as it is in all of us. Connect with that and do what speaks true to that flame.” Sir Kensington smiled and responded, “Aye, my Lord, now that is a noble idea!” At that moment, Sir Kensington’s cell phone buzzed in his pocket. It is 2017 after all. What, you’ve never heard of Live Action Role Play? He glanced at his phone; no new notifications. “Blast,” he thought, “well, time to become my own legend.”",2017
Letting Go of Expectations,"What happens when you wake up on December 31st and you haven’t lost the weight, gotten your dream job, found the love of your life or realized any of the other ambitions you set out for yourself 364 days ago? The answer is most likely that you accept it as a failure of character, perhaps cry about the sorry state of your life and make new resolutions that continue the cycle of personal disappointment. Nothing is worse than not doing what you set out to do. Well, maybe one thing: not being the absolute best at doing what you set out to do. But the pressure to be the best, most successful version of yourself can have detrimental effects on your mental wellbeing and your personal and professional relationships. Even if you do not tell a single person about your New Year’s resolutions, the internal pressure can sometimes mount into obsession and powerful negative thinking. Those of us who strive for a well-rounded and balanced life are not immune to this pressure. I recently spoke with an acupuncturist friend about the impulse to “do wellness.” As Type-A planners and wellness solopreneurs, she and I related to the pressure to do wellness “well” and be sublimely healthy all year round. You may also relate to this feeling even though you too recognize this goal as unattainable. We expect so much from ourselves in terms of work output and contributions to society, and we know that in order to maximize this we need to be healthy. We are also part of a fitness-obsessed culture that insists being healthy means not only being physically fit, but also being on top of all the wellness trends and making sure everyone who follows us on social media knows just how healthy we are. This goal of wellness for maximum performance can easily morph into unreasonable expectations placed on bodies with inherent limitations. We were not built to go on and on without injury, stress or depletion. My friend and I talked about this reality and our personal challenges with it, specifically around our periods. We empathized with each other about the conflict of wanting to be our best selves during a time when our bodies were pleading with us for rest and recuperation. She encouraged me to start tracking my period symptoms and to give myself permission to lighten my schedule around the toughest days. This was an amazing revelation and one that I share with other women all the time because in the long run, this behavior leads to a greater feeling of wellness than pushing through just to show how strong I am. My friend also told me how common it is for her to see patients who are seeking acupuncture in times of great stress, pain, or as a last result for when their bodies seem to be rebelling against them. It is understandable to seek relief when we have exhausted ourselves, but I think that if we re-focus our awareness on the ebbs and flows of our everyday lives, perhaps the need to seek critical care would be less necessary. One way to do this is to practice self-awareness and compassion. People talk about self-awareness as if it’s something you are either born with or not, but I think it is a skill that has to be practiced over time and often with the aid of therapy. Sometimes in order to become aware of who you are and what’s best for you, you really need the help of another person. I was in therapy years ago to unravel some toxic patterns in my relationships. I wanted to devote time to understanding why I became romantically involved with men who didn’t meet my expectations of them. What came out of years of exploration was something unexpected. I had to dig deep and expose some very personal beliefs I held about myself, and I had to decide if those beliefs served me anymore. Most of the time the answer was no. One belief I clung very tightly to was that my worth was tied to the quality of my work. I judged myself harshly on this even though by most standards I was excelling professionally. In turn, I judged others very harshly if the output of their work fell short of my expectations. The kicker was that if I felt like I was not excelling, then there was no way I could acknowledge the achievements of those around me. It became a vicious cycle: my belief about my worth was directly tied to how I engaged in relationships with others, and I didn’t know how to let it go. In one session with my therapist I told her that I was struggling with feelings of insecurity. I was single at the time, pouring my whole self into graduate school, and what was left over I gave to my job. I had a hard time feeling like I was doing my best in all areas of my life. In hindsight, it was one of the most stressful times of my life, but I didn’t have the ability to cut myself some slack. The way this was manifesting was outward contempt for others, including complete strangers. My morning commute was a nightmare because I was consumed by my own stress so much that the tiniest jostle on the train by someone was an affront to my very personhood. I was miserable. My therapist said this: “Maybe try having some compassion for the people around you, because you really don’t know what they could be going through. If you do that enough, you will start to ease up on yourself.” I thought this was crazy-talk, but I decided to try it. I didn’t buy any books or do any research on compassion; I just started noticing when I was judging other people for no good reason. It was shockingly frequent. This awareness then gave rise to the question, “Why am I judging them?” Of course, I did not have an answer. I then started concocting back-stories for people who annoyed or hurt me. Maybe they just received some terrible news and are not thinking clearly. Maybe their understanding of a situation is not the same as mine. Maybe there are cultural differences that I am missing. Compassion for others seemed like a bizarre entry point to letting go of expectations for myself, but I am living proof that it worked. After practicing compassion in these small, everyday ways I was able to apply it to myself. Maybe I didn’t need to force myself to work on a paper when what I really needed was to be with friends and relax. When I got back to work, the words flowed. Maybe I didn’t need to stress about my love life because I already had so much going on. I started casually dating amazing men who enriched my life. Are there days when I want to be the most put-together, poised and healthy person in the room? Of course, but I know better than to expect that from myself every day. I am far happier having reasonable expectations that I can be healthy at any size and that giving less than 100% on some projects is absolutely good enough. So am I suggesting that you give up on resolutions and setting goals of self-improvement forever? Not at all. I just hope that when you fail to read one hundred books this year, or you give in to sexting your ex or even if you indulge in a major carb-load on occasion, that you go easy on yourself. One way to do that is to take stock every day of the way that you feel and calibrate your expectations for yourself accordingly. You are only human after all.

A Dog Is A Girl’s Best Friend,"When I opened my eyes, the light was on. I could tell it was still dark outside, but I couldn’t recognize the room around me. There was a man standing in the corner. He was featureless and completely black, like a shadow. He didn’t move. I couldn’t move. My eyes were searching around the room. I looked down and saw blood all over my hands, but I couldn’t work out where it was from. I became aware of my body being filled with an unshakeable certainty that I was going to die. To most people who have suffered from panic attacks before, this feeling of life-threatening dread will be all too familiar. Yet it remains impossible to describe to those on the outside. Sometimes it can creep up on you, swelling and swelling until you can no longer hold it in. Or it can hit you fast and hard, like a car crash. It could happen anywhere: in an elevator, in a crowded supermarket aisle, walking down the street. Every little fiber in your body is screaming, telling you to run. And sometimes, the episodes can visit you in your dreams. I’d had nightmares before, but nothing had filled me with the primal fear I had experienced in that room. Half awake, half asleep. Nothing was real. My bedroom was unfamiliar. But I experienced every little emotion, every rise and fall in terror like I was still awake. I couldn’t breathe. I was convinced something was trying to kill me. I was living by myself at the time, so I awoke crying from my panic attack at 4 A.M., alone in a cold, dark room and 200 miles away from my family. I went about the rest of my day, but I couldn’t shake the night terror from my mind. I’m not “crazy,” I have severe anxiety. I was always a creative child. Even today, I can conjure up worlds, people and situations so easily in my mind that they almost dance before my eyes. But, like a deal made with a strange witch in a fairytale wood, there’s a cost that comes with having such an overactive and often out-of-control imagination. Just as my mind can create stories full of fairies, elves and whatever else my pre-teen self was occupied with, it can also create monsters. The shadow creeping out from under my bed was a sharp-toothed clown. That noise coming from the boiler in the cupboard was a vengeful robot made of rusty tin cans with knives for hands. Some of the thoughts were understandably upsetting, like the anxiety I dealt with when my parents separated, for example. Others were so overtly ridiculous that I can’t help but laugh at them now. As a kid, I used to panic every time an ambulance drove past me on the street. I’ve heard from other people that they also jump to scary conclusions such as, “maybe it’s my loved one,” but my second thought was always “but what if I got run over by a car and I’m dead, and I just don’t know it yet?” As I grew into adulthood, the elves became lofty aspirations and the frightening clowns became an overwhelming fear of failure, amongst many other things. The anxiety has always been there, but it wasn’t until I moved into the busy metropolis of London that it became unbearable. Walking past any group of people was an impossible task. Any sound of laughter must have been at my expense. I loved my lectures, but seminars were my special idea of hell. It felt like my mind had been enveloped in one thick, grey cloud. There are always lots of thoughts constantly rushing through my mind, but I can never pick out a single one. The possibilities and opportunities that my imagination gave me were being destroyed by this dark illness, and no one seemed to understand how serious it was. One of the biggest issues about growing up with anxiety without knowing you have it is that it begins to blur the line between what is normal and what is unhealthy. It wasn’t until seeing a therapist did I realize my need to constantly present myself well was yet another physical symptom. Small quirks that have always been there, like walking with my eyes on the floor, biting my nails, and not being able to sit still meant that anxiety has partly shaped who I am as a person. But that was just the beginning. After a year in London with money troubles, arguments and difficulty adjusting, we found out that one of the most important people in my world had cancer. When I opened up to my therapist about it, he told me I was describing my trauma to him as if I was describing a chair. Anxiety had taught me to be obsessed with self-managing and hiding my emotions so well that I had literally forgotten how to feel them around other people. Looking back, I see that was the point where I began to spiral too far. The anxiety became overtly physical. It felt like I had been staring at a bright, glaring computer screen for too long, and my eyes couldn’t concentrate on one thing. I was having multiple anxiety episodes pretty much every day. For me, a panic attack begins when my neck, wrist and arms feel tingly. There are pins and needles in my legs. My whole body suddenly gets hot and I start sweating. This can happen because I got a call from an unknown number, because someone keeps sending me messages when I am already busy, or because there are suddenly too many people in an elevator. It feels like always being on the brink of tears. I can’t sit still in a meeting, my feet are constantly moving and I start picking at the skin on my finger. It feels like being sat in a restaurant, and tearing a napkin into a thousand, tiny white pieces. Like scratches on my wrist where nails have dug in too hard. Like I’ve forgotten how to take long, deep breaths. When it’s really bad, I can’t move my hands or arms without shaking. My heart is burning a hole in my chest. Heartbreak feels physically painful. Insults bite like bullets and hurt crawls along my skin in prickly goosebumps. I feel lightheaded and nauseous. I want to run but I can’t move, and I don’t have anywhere to go anyway. My back aches, but I haven’t left the house in three days. It feels like a desperate need to be safe but not knowing where to find that safety since an anxiety attack can come from anywhere; in the middle of my seminar in front of 10 complete strangers, alone in my room or out for drinks with my closest friends. It feels like not knowing if I want to be alone or surrounded by people I love the most, and suddenly doubting that those people love me back. It feels like everything in the world is wrong and alien, and I feel numb. It was at the climax of all of this that those childhood monsters came to visit me again. There were nights when I was so sleep deprived that they appeared as hundreds of spiders crawling across my walls, jolting me back awake just as I was about to drift off. If anyone ever tells you that anxiety is just a problem of the mind, it’s impossible to explain just how wrong they are. Anxiety isn’t just a mental illness. For some like me, it can become so out of control that it takes on its own physical form. After a year of crippling, wildly uncontrollable anxiety, it became clear that the best thing I could do was go home. Over the next few months, my anxiety simmered down to a manageable temperature. With each walk through my familiar hometown, another spider began to crawl away. My nails began to grow back. The dark bags under my eyes softened, and I ate real food. I wrote real essays and started numerous new projects. The tin-can robot retired back to his cupboard and the shadow man disappeared. There is no clown under my bed, just the resolute remains of an anxiety-monster that made my life unliveable for two long years. I don’t think it will ever go away, but neither will the lessons I learned about fighting, survival and resilience. Submissions are closed.",2017
A Constant Hum,"I think what some people don’t understand about anxiety is that it’s not all panic. You won’t always see a person hyperventilating into a bag on the subway. Anxiety won’t always come with tears or big public breakdowns. Anxiety isn’t something that just happens in one big moment of crushing panic. It’s not always something that you can ride out until you’re feeling better and then move on until the next time it happens. It’s always there. Sometimes it’s silent and other times it’s loud — but you can always feel its presence. It sits in the middle of your chest putting just enough weight on you to always be a reminder that it’s there. It’s like having a red string tied around your finger that never lets you forget. It’s a low-level hum that has become so constant that it’s like white noise inside of your head. You might fidget, or doodle, or play with your phone — anything to keep your mind occupied. Because it’s in those silent moments between words or thoughts that the hum becomes louder. It ramps up and becomes self-doubt and worry. Fictional what-ifs for situations that may never come. The voice is always there to remind you about who you are and what you should be anxious about. It’s not just in those quiet moments either. No, anxiety is sneaky like that. It seems to find a way to interject itself into your thoughts and conversations. There isn’t a thought you have that doesn’t get put through the anxiety filter. And once something has been framed by anxiety then you know that it’s going to take a ride on the anxiety loop as well. Over, and over, and over — those thoughts that aren’t quite right going through your head. Anxiety beats you down until you’re too tired to fight the thoughts any longer. And it’s exhausting. Worry, and anxiety, and the constant tumbling of anxious thoughts through your head feel like you’re running a mental marathon every day. Your mind won’t let itself rest. Even when everything around you is still, your mind continues to work as hard as it can. Anxiety won’t take its foot off the gas even for a moment to let you catch your breath. You collapse into bed at the end of the day completely drained hoping for a small break. But your anxiety uses the silence to become even louder. Instead of slowing down and recuperating your mind speeds up instead. It feels like you’re having thoughts on top of each other — each as negative as the last. Worries about the future mixed in with shame about the past. Anything to keep you out of the present moment. Until you finally can’t take it any longer and somehow your body and mind manage to breakdown for the night. Don’t worry though — your anxiety will be there to greet you in the morning. Anxiety takes over every thought, every quiet moment, every breath, and every doodle. It’s constant and it never leaves. So be kind to each other. Much love. Derek",2017
The Bags.,"She woke up with a start! ""What was wrong this time?"" Looking up at her ceiling, she thought of the dream she'd just had. The vivid ones were always a sign. One that things were changing. Would this be a welcome change? Things had been going so well. It was about the time for the downward spiral. ""Good things don't really last, do they?"" The negative thoughts had to end, but darkness never really leaves you alone. For some reason, it stays in the shadows lurking and waiting for you to show your Achilles heel. She closed her eyes.

The anchor,"Before we go any further, let’s take a time out. Close your eyes and take a breath. One natural breath in and out. Now repeat that 5 times. And open your eyes. Ok, ready? When we take moments like this and zoom out we can appreciate that this moment, the present, is all we really have. The past has gone, it’s slipped through our fingers and left. All thoughts about it are in remembrance and laced with nostalgia. The future hasn’t happened yet, we don’t know how it will play out, we don’t know if it’s full of joy or dismay. It’s pure speculation at this point. Zooming out or stepping back can be incredibly powerful. The breath can be used as an anchor, and the process is more like diving inward. Anchoring ourselves in a moment where there is no anxiety, no bad feelings and no happiness to cling to. Just quiet space. Space to reset. Within these moments of quiet we can find pure focus. Pure focus to listen. That’s the power of the anchor.",2017
7 Lifestyle Changes That Helped Ease My Anxiety,"I saw things that children shouldn’t; experienced things that most adults hadn’t. By the time I was 14, I was said to have acute anxiety and mild depression. Then at 26 I was diagnosed with Generalized Anxiety and Panic Disorder and mild-severe major depressive disorder. After my diagnosis I was immediately placed on medication, told by my doctor that my disorder was so severe that medication was the only option effective enough to treat it. I was tagged — just another guy fighting to fit into a world that rejected anyone with a label. I didn’t know about CBT (Cognitive Behavioral Therapy) or any other complementary management approaches. I had never heard of GAD or panic disorders, and as a result, I accepted the medication that was prescribed to me. I spent the next 2 years of my life battling an addiction that I never saw coming. The pills my doctor promised would cure my anxiety created an entirely new, more fatal disease. I was no longer afraid of my anxiety, I was afraid of what my life would look like without my medication. Dependent on pills, my fear culminated into a deep pit of depression, monophobia, and two failed suicide attempts. I went back to my doctor hoping he’d help me get off the medication, but soon realized that he was no longer my doctor, he had become my dealer. I set out on my own, challenging and questioning everything I thought to be true. To save my life, I had to change the way I lived. Here are 7 lifestyle changes that have personally helped me on my road to recovery. 1. I Get 7–8 Hours of Sleep. I’ve struggled with bouts of insomnia since being diagnosed with anxiety a little over 7 years ago. A lack of sleep can be a precursor for anxiety, or a direct reflection of it. Either way, an adequate amount of sleep every night can greatly reduce your anxiety symptoms. About two hours before I plan on going to sleep, I shut off my electronic devices (tv, laptop, ipad). I put my phone on Do Not Disturb and Night Shift, take a magnesium supplement, drink a hot cup of Chamomile tea, and settle in with a good book. Occasionally when I need it, I’ll find time to get a quick power nap in during my lunch break. A good night sleep has been one of the most effective changes in managing my anxiety. 2. I Leave Work at Work It’s important to set boundaries for yourself. For many people, their biggest stressor is their job. Therefore, when my work day is over, I make sure it’s over! I turn off my work phone and don’t check emails again until morning. Sometimes this is a bit challenging because I run my own business, but it has proven to be very beneficial. I give myself permission to have a personal life outside of my career. 3. I Check My Diet When I decided to embark on this journey to save myself, the first thing I did was take a serious look at my diet and my behaviors. At the time I was a heavy smoker, a caramel latte-a-day kind of guy, and could easily lose myself in a few bottles of wine in the evening. What I learned was that I was keeping my body in a toxic state, which was stimulating my anxiety, not eliminating it. Slowly I started cutting out red meat, pork, alcohol, processed foods, caffeine, and artificial/ refined sugars. Today the majority of my diet consists of fruits, vegetables, nuts, seeds and legumes. 4. I Limit My Social Media Intake Social media can sometimes be a huge energy suck. It’s typically filled with people’s opinions about politics, current events, or personal issues — most of which I have no desire to be a part of. As someone with a severe anxiety disorder, I already have way too many irrational thoughts running through my mind on a daily basis, therefore I have to be very protective about what I allow to permeate. 5. I Go Green I drink about 32oz. of green juice every morning. For me, it’s the best way to start my day. I’ve never been a huge fan of eating lots of vegetables — so I drink them instead! I like to stick to the 80/20 rule of juicing (80% vegetables, 20% fruit). I have more energy throughout the day, and I don’t have to worry about a mid-afternoon crash like what happens with sugary or caffeinated drinks. 6. I Meditate To me, anxiety is nothing more than the perpetual fear of what if. What if it doesn’t work? What if I don’t get the promotion? What if people think I’m weird? Meditation helps to bring my attention back to the present by focusing on the one thing I have control over — my breathing. I remind myself, “as long as I can breathe, I have life, and as long as I have life, I have possibility.” Every morning I start my day with a 10 minute meditation focused purely on breathing. It’s nothing fancy, just 5 second inhale, 7 second exhale. It works every time. 7. I Read One of the most important habits I’ve picked up throughout my journey is daily reading. Whether it’s something tied to my career, something inspirational, or something about investing, I make sure to read every day. My personal favorites are self-help books and inspirational memoirs. I love learning about other people’s experiences and how they’ve overcome adversity. Feeling connected is one of the greatest feelings in the world. I remind myself daily that I have anxiety, I am not a product of it. Anxiety is a communication tool — it’s our bodies way of telling us something. It’s our job to listen and take action. Remember, pain is inevitable but suffering is optional, so let’s continue to work together to end the suffering!",2017
Designing Anguish,"I’m tired and I don’t want to talk about it. Laying down on the sofa and scrolling around Netflix seems to be all I can do. Nonetheless, I can’t pick anything. All possible options look dull. Any physical movement seems like a waste of energy. I resign to watching the color white on the wall instead. That’s how I felt for a large portion of the past year, a crippling apathy followed me everywhere. I didn’t want to leave home even though I also didn’t want to do anything there. “Want” actually may not be the right verb here, it wasn’t a matter of willingness as much as everything seemed devoid of purpose. This apathy, though, was not a worrisome state for me. I’ve been there countless times. It felt familiar, like an old friend or the flavor of a whisky brand I used to drink. Every year or so, I had felt that same way for a good six months. It may not be normal normal but it surely wasn’t strange. It was what it was. Everybody gets the blues sometimes, right? Right. So that must be what everyone else also feels like too. This time, however, I decided to do something different. I’m a game designer by trade but I was working as a producer back then and felt awfully deprived on my creativity. As a result, if I could not be creative at work, why not to try to be at home? It might even make the apathy go away faster, who knows. That’s when I decided to start Rainy Day and make it about a fictitious day during a very real apathetic period. I’ve played plenty of interactive narratives up to that point and something that I missed in most of them is the lack of, well, interactivity. Most of them are great stories but quite linear in structure, with large walls of text before each option that then in turn lead to another large wall of text. Maybe it’s because I’m impatient or maybe it’s because English is my second language so reading large chunks of text often feels like a chore. I also understand why people use this structure; the narrative feels more like a fleshed out story and the linearity is essential to maintain a pace. With a linear story you can pace out the beginning, the climax and the ending as you wish, nothing strays too far from your original plan. But that wasn’t how I felt. I felt like a mess. I felt like I kept spiralling in fruitless circles of my own lack of interest. Nothing felt like a climax. Everything just felt equally bad. So I decided to take a different approach to convey that, even though it could compromise the pacing. When I was in this state of mind, a normal day felt like an eternal maze. I would linger between thoughts of activities, barely starting any or feeling awful while doing them. The feeling of being lost and overwhelmed was something I wanted to recreate so I used two strategies for this. First, there is no clear path to take. You know you need to go to work, but do you really need need? Which option seems more in tune with going to work: taking a shower or making coffee? Perhaps neither. Maybe you should call in sick. You never know how the story will unfold and you don’t know the result of your actions. This sounds like a bad game design choice (no clear feedback for actions? That’s crazy!) but I believe it worked in this context because not only because it reinforces the how you feel in this state of mind but also because no single action will make you lose. All actions sum up and may result in making your state of mind worsen, which will rule out some actions or lead to certain endings, but never will one wrong click lead to game over. Instead, it is always a path of triggering bad choices, and every bad choice is immediately represented by a change in the background (more of the background change in the next segment). This additive system was accomplished by tracking the protagonist’s anxiety levels. Every choice you make, every action you take, or try to, will not only add time to your “lateness” but can also influence your state of mind. For instance, taking a shower looks like a good idea, right? In the shower, you have a emotional breakdown which adds a lot of anxiety to the character. After this collapse, the protagonist comes to terms with the randomness of life and has anxiety points subtracted, so you actually feel better after the shower. There are instances like that during the whole game and the anxiety count influences how the protagonist sees the world, which action is available and, in some parts of the game, if your anxiety is too high, can directly lead to a game over. You can reach game over pretty fast if you chose many actions that trigger anxiety, but some of the actions that are the larger source of anxiety can also bring relief. Sometimes. The 3DS passage does exactly that. If you win, you get a lot less anxious, but there is just a small, random chance of winning and losing makes you even more anxious. Good luck with that. Some of the unknown results may take you back to some passage you have already been to before, which enforces the idea of loops. This isn’t as frustrating as one would think. I believe it is because all pages that host loops have different content after certains visits. New options may be available, and sometimes even more or new text. You may be back where you started but this time you can go somewhere new. My second strategy to convey the messy headspace was to give players a lot of choices, many of them with unclear results. The abundance of indiscernible choices creates and highlights doubt and, therefore, reduces confidence in any of the options. This leads the player to feel less confident about choices taken and maybe even a little confused. Doubtful and insecure, the Player is brought closer to the protagonist. All those decisions sound like the total opposite of accepted game design rules. I know that. What will result from this is frustration. I know that too. But isn’t that the whole point of this game? Since this is a digital narrative and not on printed media, I could use anything HTML could provide me. I decided I really needed a way to express how the protagonist was feeling, how anxious they were. I could use a traditional health or something direct like that but that didn’t make any sense in this game. Most of the time, when feeling this way, not even you can tell for sure how bad you are until something more dramatic happens. I decided the most elegant approach was a subtle one: changing the color of the background. It starts as a very comfortable shade of green and as you get anxious it slowly morphs into a less pleasant shade or yellow and then to a very disturbing reddish tone. The blurred text was also a subtle translation of the lack of focus in this mindset. Many players said it felt like the thoughts were forming while they were playing and if they didn’t pay attention to the thought, it would run way. I could not think of a better description for this feeling. The illustrations were also a very important aspect of Rainy Day. It was important to feel melancholic, not exactly sad and centaintelly not joyous. Amora B. is a friend of mine who has an amazing art style and has insider knowledge of the issue. Although she generally does more uplifting art, I thought she could add a lot to the project. Just because most of the jobs you are doing streer your work to one direction, that doesn’t mean you don’t know how to make a turn. The sound was the last ambient item to be added. We live with an overload of stimulus these days and, if you played Rainy Day, I bet you did it with a bunch of other tabs opened too. In the beginning, Rainy Day didn’t had anything besides visual stimuli. While only one sense was being stimulated (vision) it is easier to drift away from game. I decided to add the rain effect to improve the ambience but I didn’t want to become too “gamey”. Just some rain, traffic, and café environment sounds, to make the player feel as if they were there. The sound turned an otherwise ok interactive story into something closer of a full experience. Adding the ambient sounds with rain, traffic and white noise not only made it more interesting as an experience but also strengthened the relatability of the story. It is raining today. It really is, I can hear it. Some people asked me after playing: “What was I supposed to achieve”? Well, I don’t know, what are you supposed to achieve in your life? Rainy Day didn’t start as a game, I didn’t plan it to have a goal. Instead, it was supposed to feel more like a simulator. You are supposed to replicate your own life expectations and make choices while Rainy Day shows you what would have happened if you were in this apathitic state. You think the most important thing a person has is their job? So go there. You believe having a little fun in important? You have a cellphone and a 3DS. Are you an Agent Cooper type of person that gives yourself a small present everyday? There are a lot of coffee situations in Rainy Day. The thing about giving this amount of freedom in the choices and having the loop structure is that no single ending would fit all journeys. Considering most paths, I came up with four endings that made the most sense. They are all possible results of a day dealing with this crippling apathy and they are all different outcomes for the different choices. After playing the game as yourself, the existence of the different endings offers an incentive to replay the game as differents forms of yourself or even as an entirely different person. I believe this helps the player to practice empathy. Another very common question from players that have played Rainy Day for a while is, “Is there a good ending?”, which I’m always tempted to ask back, “Is there any good ending for anything? When you get to work safely, do the curtains come down and the applause goes up letting you know you just reached a good ending for that struggle?” I don’t reply with this because I’m not a pretentious prick but it’s still a lingering desire and a constant belief. Still, “good” and “bad” endings are much more a matter of perspective than anything else. We as audiences are used to seeing closure in this moral value scale because that’s how we are used to see it in fiction (both games and movies), but the fact is things are not inherently that simple in real life. Is there anything else in our lives other than the sourness of failure and the bittersweet disappointment of success? That is a very Zöe question that could be asked in this Zelda way (BoJack Horseman reference here) “the learning experience of failure and the fulfillment of success?” It’s still the same question with the same topic but with a different outlook of the same situation. That’s the thing about the particular problem Rainy Day brings to the spotlight: you don’t get to have other outlooks. Ever. Unless you get out of this self-sabotaging way of thinking. Which is not an option in this experience. Each of the four endings are different and each one of them takes you somewhere and makes you understand something, but really, which one is better: feeling like shit at home with nothing to do or feeling like crap at the office where every task seems meaningless? There is no good ending when you feel like this, you first need to get some help. In February or something we almost finished Rainy day. Almost. The thing is I started to feel better and looking back to the game made me remember of all that not very nice period. I can’t say development was paused, but before that I worked on Rainy Day almost every weekend and after that I worked one or two hours per week. If I opened the game in that week at all. That is not all bad, right? You feel better, you move on. It doesn’t matter if you released the thing or not as long as you are in a better place than before. Since this game was so personal, I also felt a certain fear of rejection of releasing it. If it draw too much criticism, I also would be under criticism. My whole life would be a big red target. It wasn’t something I worked on as a part of a team, it wasn’t a project about a subject I thought it was cool. Even though I’m not the protagonist and much of them were based on other people’s experiences, I still had too much in common with them to be comfortable with all sorts of criticism. I also feared this game could hurt my professional career in some way, tear apart something it took me so long to build. That was really scary. In July, I realised I wasn’t in such a better place than when I was when did Rainy day if it was fear that was keeping me from publishing it. I decided that to actually close the wound I had to publicly release it, no matter what happened after that. So I worked a bit more on the balancing and the connections between the passages and got ready for release. Two months now after release, Rainy Day has around 170 thousand accesses. This is crazy. But besides the surprise on how the game got popular, two other interesting things happened when I released Rainy Day. First, a lot of people who played it said they really identify with the protagonist. I had the feeling I wasn’t the only one that felt that way, but I also thought not many people would share that feeling of inadequacy, lack of purpose and self worth. The amount of people identifying with the story got me completely off guarded. A lot of close friends too, whom I thought had the most happy and interesting lives. Hmm. That was weird. So despite all the happy, cheerful faces on Facebook and Twitter, a lot of people feel like that? Many of my friends also? The ones that looked like they had all their shit figured out? That was interesting but also quite scary. How many more people suffer from these issues and don’t talk about them? How many also feel it is something silly, small and that will eventually go away? Though most people related in a personal level to the protagonist, there were some that said they really didn’t feel that way but knew someone who did that they didn’t quite understood before. And the game made them closer of understanding of how it felt. A digital narrative slash game made them feel closer to loved ones in a way they never felt before. That was an amazing outcome and the feedback I got was simply overwhelming. Being able to help so many people understand this issue is just amazing. I have no words to describe it it. The second thing and even more surprising to me was that both players and media were discussing Rainy Day as a depression story. Wait a second. I was sure Rainy Day was about a general kind of sadness, mixed with social anxiety and the everlasting apathy. That’s was all I saw in it, and if you download the actual twine game you will see all variables I use are called anxiety or time. But depression? I never said depression. The disclaimer when you end Rainy Day doesn’t even cite depression. I have been dealing with this for almost two decades now. Are you guys sure about this? Like, really sure? Apparently, yes. The only way I could face I have been dealing with depression for all this time was to make a game how I felt and publishing it. If I haven’t had done Rainy Day or haven’t pushed the publish button I probably would never acknowledge or accept that what I felt was indeed depression. I’m really grateful for that. I have since seeked professional support which have made everything much more bearable. It isn’t like all my live mysteriously got sorted out, it feels more like now I feel apt to capable to deal with everything that have been happening and don’t feel quite drained out like before. If making Rainy Day and having people playing it and sharing their stories have not saved my life quite surely improved its quality significantly. So though there might have nice ideas and processes in this text on how to build interactive narrative, I believe the main take away is to make games about how you feel. Well, remember when Neil Gaiman said that when you are an artist, you must do art? No matter what happens or how you feel, you should most definitely create something with it or about it. Rainy Day was that and, by doing it, I not only was able to feel better about myself during a difficult time and create an experience to help others understand how it feels. I also learned something about me I didn’t know before. Something I had for a long time and I didn’t even realised it since I just worked around it. If you are a game developer, I beg you, make games about things that matter to you and friends. If you feel great, if you feel blue, if you want to propose to you special someone, doesn’t matter just make games. It may just feel like only a release valve while you are doing it, but when you revisit it afterwards you may learn something new about yourself, something you didn’t know before. Games can be your family album or diary some years from now, with vivid representations of your life in different times. Or you can even, maybe, get diagnosed about a serious problem you didn’t knew you have.❤",2017
Accepting Grief for a Lost Inner Child,"Grief; the one and perhaps only word that could invoke more emotions than the word love is near impossible to describe. It’s like a tsunami of emotions that suddenly overwhelm you to a point you did not know you could reach, while your mind is caught in the eye of the storm, spinning out of control. It is a physical pain that encompasses your whole being, tightening every muscle in your body while sucking the air out of your lungs; even breathing becomes painful. The tears stream down your face uncontrollably and if it is possible, your heart physically hurts. Grief involves a major loss of something we are attached to, and is not limited to what it is most associated with…death. There is often grief involved with the loss of a home, job or even a friendship.There is no timetable that comes with grief; it is completely individualistic and situational. There is no right or wrong way to deal with it, there is only what is best for you. Sure, there are common stages that the majority of people will deal with when it comes to grief; the denial and anger, the bargaining, depression and eventual acceptance, but each person will experience them differently. These stages may sound familiar if you have suffered a deep loss, like a death, as you may have passed through them on your path to healing. We learn how to mourn for other people, great losses and even material attachments, but have we ever been taught, as survivors, that it is ok to mourn all that we lost? We lost our innocence and our ability to trust. We lost our voices out of fear and shame. We lost the developing identity that may have been, had we not been violated. We became empty shells with no functional ability to process the trauma occurring. We could not fight, nor flight and so we froze, and the survival portion of the brain took over, to save us from the trauma we could not handle. In essence we lost our childhoods, and we need to grieve such an immense loss in order to heal.Grieving for an external loss seems to come more naturally than trying to grieve for oneself. Trying to understand the loss of your inner child not only involves having to acknowledge that you still have an inner child, but also accepting the fact that the “little you” was hurt and violated and bears no responsibility for the trauma endured, which is something many survivors struggle with for years. We became experts at denial the instant we were defiled and we continue along that path until we are emotionally strong enough to deal with the truth.Anger is almost innate for most survivors. It starts with the abuse and sometimes lasts a lifetime. We are rarely presented with the opportunity to express the anger we are burdened with to the source that caused our pain, and despite carrying it around for so long, we are often incapable of outwardly expressing it appropriately. When anger becomes internalized, as a child we act out in a multitude of ways, and as we age these behaviors can lead to self-destructive habits such as addiction and self-harm as methods of coping. We may be able to get help dealing with and properly expressing our anger and recognizing its effects on our present day lives through therapy, or a workbook and although I believe it eases up in time, mine certainly has, but I think it is something we shall carry with us to some degree through the rest our lives.Bargaining is the normal reaction to feelings of helplessness and vulnerability in a desperate attempt to regain even just a small piece of the control we lost as children. For years, we play the “what if” game, wondering if we had only done something differently or if we had spoken up, would things have been different? As children we can’t do much bargaining because we are unequipped to do anything other than go into survival mode. As we age, beliefs depending of course, we sometimes try bargaining with a “higher power” in an effort to trade or give up anything we can think of if the abuse stops. Sadly, however most survivors do not end up dealing with their trauma until adulthood and by then, bargaining seems futile.Depression, I would say, affects nearly every single survivor at various degrees, during their lives, sometimes sporadically sometimes never ending. It may have started when we were young but was not recognized until we were teens or adults and therefore it is often not until we are in our twenties and thirties or later that we can even begin to truly process and try to heal from the trauma we suffered as children. With the grief of any major loss comes such a heavy sadness and emotional weight not only at the time of the event but often for years after. Depression is certainly not limited to grief but is a true indication that something deeper lays beneath the surface. Acceptance for survivors is multi-faceted, non-linear, and for some may never happen. It is difficult to accept any loss, but to accept losing a childhood that can never be reclaimed is a long and arduous process. It becomes further complicated because often our abusers are family members or friends making it even more difficult to acknowledge such a betrayal as our truth. With proper support and perhaps therapy we can to try and learn to accept the traumas that have melded us into the people we are today. So grieve. Grieve for your inner child and all the losses that you suffered, but show yourself the same support and caring that you would give to anyone else.",2017
"Panic Attacks, Music Theory, and Learning to Be Mysterious","Right after graduating college I started getting panic attacks. At first I was shocked, hit by each surge of anxiety like someone wandering a subway tunnel he thought was abandoned. The attacks seemed unpredictable and without obvious causes — how was I to prepare for them? One day I had an idea. I sat down and wrote the ‘panic attack list’: a list of all the physical events that occur during a panic attack in order. I provided instructions to myself on how to accurately reproduce a panic attack, as if casting an inevitable spell: And so on. Writing the list was in itself a cathartic act, and, incredibly, even though not the goal of the exercise, the panic attacks lessened and eventually dissipated (so far). It was a bit of unexpected magic — a written list that seemed to have immediate psychological effect, and yet of course who knows exactly what happened in my tumultuous psyche, as my sense of self and relationships were in constant flux. I think I can say this much, however — writing down a list of ‘symptoms’ allowed me to accept the intrusion of a very unpleasant experience. It seems that a crucial element of having a panic attack is not wanting to have a panic attack (a natural inclination), and the resistance of anxiety is itself the definition of anxiety. So the list was a guiding voice that said, “Like it or not, this precise series of events might happen to you.” The process of going through each step diffused its strength, which actually was my level of internal resistance to the whole thing. Mysteries hold power over us. But through writing, and because panic attacks in my experience have a recurring sequence, this tortuous mystery was disarmed. Looking back I see that this approach was foreshadowed by my years of studying music in college. I was a jazz performance major, and for four years (and many before that) I took music theory courses, wherein budding musicians learned the ‘rules’ — the theories derived from studying written music, dictating what musical components produced what musical effects. Music theory, among many other uses, allows us to recreate great music. At its basic level, music theory is a list: perform certain events in a certain order, and we have music. All we have to do is learn to read the list. These rules, just like the ‘panic attack list,’ were extremely helpful. They transformed the mysteries of Bach, Mozart, and Beethoven into coherent, reproducible parts in repetitive combinations, with the effect that the initial shock of brilliance gave way to empowering excavation. We mined the works of great artists for their tools, explaining each idiosyncratic flourish with our expanding theoretical language. Our new musical vocabulary, if we really understood it, gradually became incorporated in our own work. I loved music theory and still do; it irreversibly changed the way I think about and experience music. The two examples above, ‘panic attack lists’ and music theory, show how language can help us. Where the use of language gets complicated, however, is when we take language to be the literal reality that it represents symbolically. Words, thoughts, and concepts, we sometimes forget, are a component of reality, an arising within the flow of life, rather than a means of perfectly defining or capturing it. So often we are deceived by its functionality, and we imagine that language gives us impossible powers. I saw this first hand. Over the years, I gradually mistook music theory for music. As an improviser in the jazz program, I approached the piano with a head full of ideas about music. When playing in a band, my inner narrative ran: ‘if they play that, I can play this and I already know it will sound interesting,’ or ‘over this chord it would be hip to play this scale, and work with the next chord too.’ My playing was heavy with analysis, strangled of life by my self-conscious desire to avoid mystery, my need to understand everything completely. The eventual result was that I was better at playing rock music, because then I felt free. I didn’t care so much about theory; the stakes were lower, and the music arose by itself. Pianist Keith Jarrett, echoing the first line of the Tao Te Ching, reminds us of the mystery of music (from the first line of a speech from 2014): “Music is not something you can use words to describe.” There is a saying in Zen Buddhism, from 7th century monk Huineng: “Truth has nothing to do with words. Truth can be likened to the bright moon in the sky. Words, in this case, can be likened to a finger. The finger can point to the moon’s location. However, the finger is not the moon. To look at the moon, it is necessary to gaze beyond the finger, right?” Language and thought are inextricable from our lives. In many ways, thoughts are the flow of life itself. We are changed by our ideas and discussions about things in the world in untold ways. But, nonetheless, the mysteries of experience persevere. A list of symptoms is not a panic attack. A list of musical rules is not music, and when we forget these things, we miss our own brilliance, our own expression. Language can point to the experiences of life. To see the flow of life itself, however, we must move beyond language, right? Here’s Keith Jarrett’s full speech from 2014, and some info about Huineng.

Today it was Anxiety,"Anyone that knows me on any level deeper than basic knows that I am, at times, anxious. It doesn’t take a super genius to realize that I jump at loud noises, worry about irrelevant things, exaggerate fears into unrealistic scenarios and apologize for things that aren’t worthy of atonement. I’m anxious. I’ve been anxious for as long as I can remember, I’ve been slapped with the “Anxiety” label forever. And thats okay. Today, It was anxiety. I woke up anxious. Nothing triggered it, there was no catastrophic event that occurred in my little world. There were just seemingly normal things in my world today that my mind decided needed some extra attention. Its annoying. I didn’t want to get out of bed. I wanted to sleep, worry, cry, worry some more, and do basically anything besides get up and face the world (and all of its people) today. My mind couldn’t even get over the anxieties in my own room, let alone all of those I’d have to face if I walked out the door. I felt ill and wanted to skip class and spend some time with myself. But I didn’t feel like I could send my professor an email stating “I am feeling anxious today and I don’t feel well enough to come to class” because society, as a whole, doesn’t see “Anxiety” as a valid excuse. Now, lets be real, its not fun. I don’t, by any stretch of the imagination, enjoy being anxious. It creates difficulty in my life. It sometimes straps you into bed. It has physical symptoms. It makes your “outgoing and bubbly” personality nonexistent. It adds stress to friendships. It robs the joy of things you love. It makes your family concerned. It sucks the energy out of you. Its tiring. It is hard. But it’s okay. And there are some things that it is not. Its not shameful. Its not something to feel guilty about. Its not a choice all of the time. Just like any other “condition, illness, disease” (whatever you want to call it) its a struggle. Its hard. If someone had an infection, or the flu, or needed stitches, would we shame them for that? Would we tell them to “suck it up” or “just not worry anymore” or to “get over it?” No person in their right mind would tell a sick person to “just get better already.” And Anxiety is no different. Its a struggle. It is hard. It is real. Why do so many people treat “psychological struggles” with a stigma of shame? What makes Anxiety (or any other struggle for that matter) unmentionable? Why can’t we call it what it is? A struggle. A struggle is a struggle. Whether it’s a physical illness, an addiction, an injury or anxiety. Its a real and difficult problem for someone. IT IS VALID. Let me be clear, I am by NO MEANS advocating for letting anxiety control your life. You can’t let it. That is not any way to live. You can’t spend your entire life locked up in your room, avoiding people and places and anxiety provoking situations. You HAVE to get up, get out, face the day, and live your life. But its a process. You have to work on it every day, and pray about it every day. Ask God to calm your anxious heart. Ask him to grant you the grace for today. For the ability to work through the feelings of fear and worry you are experiencing. For Him to place people in your life to walk alongside you in this journey. For you to cast your cares and worries to Him, and for Him to carry and sustain you. I promise He won’t let you go.",2017
Put a plaster on that anxiety!,"Over the next year, one in four of us will experience a mental health problem, a statistic that is daunting and scary at the least. Even with the numbers of those affected rising, there is still a frightening amount of stigma around mental health that prevents those affected from speaking out and feeling comfortable in doing so to find help. One of the biggest obstacles people who suffer from mental health issues face is that people who don’t understand what they’re going through tend to compare mental illness to physical illness — something that’s entirely different. The comparison between how people treat those with physical illness and mental illness is extremely vast and it’s unfair for it to be that way. Some people believe that non-medical ways to treat mental illness are better than non-organic medicines, such as Katie Hopkins. She publicly tweeted a series of statements in March of 2015, which lead to uproar online when it revealed her views on anti-depressants. Her tweets were initially aimed at pilot Andreas Lubitz after he was thought to have deliberately crashed a plane of people into the French Alps in a bid to end is own life stating “Sympathy for the co-pilot is making me angry. If you are suicidal, for goodness sake top yourself in private. Attention seeking b*stards”. This initially made a lot of her followers angry but she then proceeded to follow it up two minutes later with “People with depression do not need a doctor and a bottle of something that rattles. They need a pair of running shoes and fresh air”. Throwing out the statistic that since 1991 the UK had seen a 500% growth in anti-depressants didn’t seem to appease her followers or even subdue them even with the presence of facts with one Twitter user replying with “Katie Hopkins is vile, her ‘opinion’ on depression is the many reasons why there’s so much stigma behind the illness and asking for help” after she stated that “To be diagnosed with depression is the holy grail of illnesses for many. The ultimate passport to self obsession. Get a grip people”. Whilst some people believe that mental illnesses can be treated to some avail through more natural remedies, for example UK high street retailer of vitamins, minerals and herbal supplements, Holland and Barrett, sell products that claim to help with anxiety, such as herbal teas and tablets. This may be an option for sufferers of mental health issues who prefer organic remedies, but not for everyone, especially since prescribed medication is proven to balance out the chemicals in the brain to help with mental illnesses such as depression and anxiety. But whilst high street stores like this continue to produce and sell products like this people who are ignorant to the suffering of mental health will continue to believe they’re the ‘cure’ for people who suffer. This will result in them refusing to view mental illnesses as legitimate illnesses that need to be treated by science and medicines rather than the solution being to ‘go on a walk and get some fresh air’ because at the end of the day you wouldn’t tell someone with a broken arm to go for a jog to feel better rather than have a cast put on to fix it, so why would you tell someone with depression that in order to feel better they need to have a nap over taking prescribed medication.",2017
Least Favorite Disney World Ride,"My dad, just like everyone, had quirks. One of the first quirks I noticed was his leg, which he always would shake while sitting. When I was younger, I never really thought about why he did this — I figured it was just something he liked to do. However, later on, I realized he did this because he was perpetually anxious. For as long as I can remember, my dad was always a worrywart; he stressed out about things he had limited control over. He always worried about my brother and me, which got worse as we got older (more about that later on). He would occasionally check on us in the middle of the night as we slept, didn’t allow me to go to a friend’s house to sleep over for the longest time, and became visibly upset when I cried in front of him. Even though I didn’t like to see my dad so frazzled, I embraced him for who he was. Dad was a sensitive guy, and I tried to lessen his anxiety burden as much as possible by trying to be a good kid. To give you an example of his anxiety/worry, I’ll tell the story about Disney World — it’s the earliest memory I have of my dad freaking out. I was no more than four years old when my parents took Antonio and me to the world famous theme park. I have almost no recollection of anything that happened that day except for a single event: Riding Space Mountain. Space Mountain is a space-themed roller coaster ride that takes place in a big white building. It’s a fast ride, with tight, technical turns throughout. Space Mountain is also was a single-seater, so that was exciting for a young kid like myself — I get to be completely autonomous (or so I thought). And even though the ride is fast, it’s almost too fast — you wait at least an hour or so in line for something that’s so short (it’s three minutes). I remember bringing my pink stuffed rabbit along for the ride, which I believe these days she wouldn’t have been allowed come with me. Luckily, times were simpler back then, and pink bunny and I were strapped into a seat. My dad sat directly behind me, and I believe my brother and mother didn’t come along because neither cared for roller coaster rides. We were propelled forward, and the adrenaline instantly hit my tiny body for the first time. I remember the cold feeling of the air against my face and the neon lights flashing by. I also felt my dad’s hands, desperately trying to grab my shoulders and arms. He quickly brought me back to my dependence on him, with the freedom feeling slowly diminishing. I remember being flustered and thinking, “What the heck is he doing?” That’s all I remember from that day and time. Years later, my dad helped fill in the remainder. He said that once the ride took off, we immediately took a few sharp, tight turns and he couldn’t see me because I was so short and it was dark. He thought I fell out and he instinctively grabbed the seat I was in to ensure that I was still there. Once he could somewhat feel me, he didn’t want to let go for the fear that at the next turn, I might slip out. Once we got off the ride, I excitedly looked up at him and asked, “Papi, can we go on the ride again?” At this point in the story, he always told this part with an exasperated laugh. He recalled saying, “Oh no! We’re not doing that again.” And with that, we went on tamer rides where he could keep an eye on pink bunny and me. This story was one of many that he would repeat throughout the years, and every time he told it, I could see his brow furrow and his tone change. It definitely scarred him to some capacity, and it worried me that it was something that he allowed to eat at him and exacerbate his anxiety. But that was dad, and unfortunately his constant angst, worry, and stress would consume him in the end.",2017
Cooking and anxiety,"Stress provoking due to cost? Mundane due to the daily necessity of having to prepare something? Or an enjoyable, grounding act bringing a sense of achievement? Possibly a mix of all the above. But as with many simple activities that fall by the wayside when struggling mentally, it’s benefits sometimes need to be shouted aloud. Many daily tasks can be repetitive, abstract in its nature, cooking on the other hand is tangible and awakens your senses. Attempt to cook appreciating the smell, touch and taste of each ingredient and it can help bring you present with the moment. All the while preparing something which gives a sense of accomplishment personally but also provides for a way of sharing and contributing to the wellbeing of others with your finished article. Reflecting and making an effort to cook mindfully and being conscious of your diet is an important and empowering way of helping to take control of your mental health. The charity Food for the brain have made promoting positive food choices their mission and run an excellent site to channel this ambition. Their online advice with regards to building resilience to stress and other mental health conditions serves as a comprehensive resource. We need to reflect on our dependence on stimulants, ensure we eat three healthy meals a day, don’t skip breakfast, try and choose slow-releasing carbohydrates rather than refined foods, and put emphasis on protein based meals to sustain a healthy level of energy. However, in hectic, busy times, achieving a balanced, mindful approach to this essential part of our lives is not always as straightforward as it should be. Acknowledging that we are living in times whereby our finances are being squeezed more than ever, it’s important to be realistic and not make our commitment to eating well become a source of further distress and anxiety in itself. It’s about doing what you can with what you have. Anna Jones and the clear and positive narrative in her book ‘a modern way to cook’ excellently shines a light on the need to simplify approaches to cooking rather than over complicating the process, reflecting on the importance of a balanced approach to preparing nourishing home cooked meals, sticking to nature as best we can and not following the latest fad. As we know, there is no magic wand to overcoming mental health issues but rather a toolkit of approaches that work for the individual. Consistent for every person on the planet however, is the need to give yourselves the best chance possible to maintain stable wellbeing based on getting these simple and necessary things right.",2017
Important,"When times are hard, I look inside and see what I can do to fix myself. It isn’t always easy, because there is a lot to fix. Anxiety and depression aren’t just something you can wish away or cure with a miracle drug. This is important to know because for some reason, people STILL don’t understand that fact. Sometimes, doing something so insanely small makes me feel proud, and like I’m moving in the right direction. Something that other people might think is not a huge deal, is sometimes one of the most important things I can do for myself. For example: Leaving my house. Going to the store. Staying at a friends house longer than an hour. To people who don’t suffer with an invisible illness, these things seem like normal every day things that everyone can accomplish easy-peasy. For me, it is a task. Something that I might not want to even try to attempt because I’ll feel like I’m crawling out of my skin. I need to make these important steps if I want to get better. If I want to succeed in life. If I want to help myself in the short and long term. It isn’t easy for me, and not everyone understands this. So let me break it down for you in a way that you might be able to understand…. So this is what I beg of everyone who doesn’t deal with what I do on the daily. Please, just TRY to put yourself in my shoes. Try to understand how important it is for me to get help, to try to work on myself, and to have support in doing so. The last thing I need is to have someone I care about not support me and make me feel worse about my predicament. I know I write a lot about my anxiety and depression, but it is a real thing. It is something that plagues me regularly, and I don’t know how many times I need to explain myself. I feel like sometimes my message doesn’t get through to most people and that, friends, is frustrating. So please, PLEASE. Try to understand. And if you can’t understand, at least try to be supportive in any way that you can. Whether it be saying, “Good job, I’m glad you went out and did something today!” or “Don’t worry, maybe next time will be better”. “You’re trying and that’s what matters.” “You’re important to me and I care about you and want to see you happy.” “I’m proud of what you did today.” Any one of these could make my day. Please try to understand the importance of support and acceptance. Thank you.",2017
Researchers Suggest Targeting Dissociation in Anxiety Disorder Patients,"Sometimes, a patient suffering from an anxiety disorder and panic attacks may seem very resistant to treatment at first. According to a new study published in Neuropsychiatric Disease and Treatment, that apparent resistance may be a result of the dissociative behaviour that the patient uses to cope with anxiety and trauma. If psychologist in Singapore can develop ways to target the dissociation first and break down that mental barrier, the path forward to better mental health could be much clearer. Dissociation is a particular method of defence that the mind engages when faced with stress or trauma. It usually occurs in people who have undergone multiple traumatic episodes. When people dissociate, their awareness of the environment, people, and events around them is altered. They may experience an altered sense of memory, consciousness, or identity. People who suffer from anxiety or panic disorders tend to be around a 4 or 5 on a scale of 1–10 when it comes to the severity and likelihood of dissociation. These individuals may be able to put themselves into a kind of trance or engage a surreal sense of reality that takes them out of the trauma or stress that they were feeling a moment before. A person who dissociates may feel as if their body has become much larger or very tiny. They may have tunnel vision, become sensitive to sound and light, or believe that stationary objects are actually moving. They may be driving and suddenly realise that they can’t recall a large portion of the drive, or they may miss large segments of a conversation. These individuals may enter a trance and stare into space for lengthy periods of time, without realising how long they are actually sitting there. Therapy involves delving into the root causes of certain fears and emotions, unwrapping those anxieties and the reasons behind them. If a patient constantly dissociates during therapy sessions, it shows an unwillingness to be in the moment and to deal with the source of the mental health issues. With the insight granted by this new study on dissociation, psychiatrists in Singapore may be able to develop new techniques for dealing with the dissociative tendency itself. Once they teach the patient how to respond without dissociating, they can move forward with treatment of the anxiety disorder. Do you have a loved one that seems to go into strange moods or have odd episodes of staring into space? Perhaps you have experienced the symptoms of dissociation yourself, related to something traumatic or anxiety-inducing. There’s no need to keep struggling with this alone.

Speak Your Mind,"“Not until we are lost do we begin to understand ourselves.” — Henry David Thoreau There’s no denying it; mental health has become one of the most prominent issues in our society. It is almost guaranteed that at least one person in your life suffers from a mental health issue. I am one of those people. I am told by professionals that I suffer from anxiety and PTSD. I have also previously struggled with depression for a period of time in my life. Mental health is not something that is particularly easy to talk about. It exposes your vulnerability, your weaknesses, your insecurities, and there’s still an idea of shame when we talk about it. It’s something I know that I quite often hide away and try to deal with alone. It’s not something that can effectively be dealt with on it’s own, nor should it be. It should be used as an opportunity to connect people as human beings. It’s so easy for people to jump to conclusions about others, about their actions, and their personalities. Everyone has gone through some type of grief or hardship in their life and it impacts everyone in different ways. We need to break this stigma and let people know that there is no shame in talking about your mental health, good or bad. There’s power and inspiration to be found in the people who find the courage to share their stories with others; those who speak their minds. Although I may seem like a fairly outgoing person through school, work, and volunteering, we all have demons in our closet that we mask from the general population of the world. I have found happiness and peace in my life in finding things that I love doing and feel passionate doing but I still carry around a lot of fear and anixety in most of what I do. New environments and situations scare me. I have trust issues with new people that I meet. I carry around my heavy past with me . . . but I’ve learned to push through the fear and to just go head first into whatever I do because I can’t live my life in fear. That doesn’t mean I have it all figured out. That doesn’t mean I don’t have nights when I break down and have anxiety attacks, but it means I’ve found a way to live with it while I figure the rest out. That’s the best I can do right now and I’m at a point in my life where I am okay with it. I’m okay with the sharp edges I have and taking the time to learn how to smooth them out. The people around me who care have learned to deal with the sharp edges, they help me smooth them out too, and they’re incredible at being awesome support systems. I definitely recognize the amazing support system I have around me. I am so incredibly lucky and grateful to have them to help me get through the hard days, to help minimize the ‘triggers’, and to help me get through those panic attacks when they do happen. Not all of us are quite so lucky to have support systems in place. For every text or call made by Bell customers, every tweet or Instagram post using the hashtag #BellLetsTalk, Facebook video view, and Snapchat geofilter used on Bell Let’s Talk Day, Bell will donate 5¢ more to mental health initiatives across Canada. This will allow for support systems to be created for those who are struggling to fight their own minds every single day and don’t have the proper tools and supports in place to help them. Awareness surrounding mental health and helping to break free of the stigma created around mental health is so important for everyone. Please, take the time to spread awareness of this issue and participate in Bell Let’s Talk day. No matter how big or small the contribution is, it will make an impact. If we stand together and break down barriers and help our communities, we can create a better tomorrow for every single person suffering from a mental health issue. If you are suffering from any sort of mental health issue please, I beg of you to seek the help you deserve. There are more open hearts and loving people out there than you may think who are more than willing to help you. You don’t have to suffer in silence and you don’t have to suffer alone.

How to ease depression and anxiety after the Trump inauguration even if you don’t have health insurance,"Has the inauguration made the reality of the new president finally set in and you’re having trouble dealing? A lot of us are struggling right now with coming to terms with the poor decisions and constant insensitivity of the new presidential regime. Maybe you already live with anxiety and/or depression. Or maybe this is new to you and you’re blindsided by your new emotions (or your disturbing lack of emotions). Unfortunately, you may not have insurance (or you know that soon your beloved Obamacare will be gone). So in this blog post you’ll learn 9 questions to ask yourself to figure out: It can be really tough to motivate yourself to exercise when you’re already feeling shitty. But exercise is one of the best actions you can take for your mental health. And there are lots of ways to do it that don’t cost any money! Since you’re already feeling bad, this isn’t the time to force yourself to do whatever exercise the women’s magazines are telling you is the best way to trim fat from your “problem areas.” Nope, you’re going to figure out what exercise you’re willing to do by thinking about which ones you actually enjoy doing. Possible suggestions: If you suddenly find yourself struggling with your mental health, your performance at work may suffer. You might: The fact that your boss and coworkers generally respect you may not mean they’ll automatically be understanding if you suddenly start “underperforming.” If you haven’t already told them that you sometimes struggle with mental health issues that can affect you at work, they might assume that it turns out you’re a slacker. Even when people know you have mental health issues, they won’t necessarily assume that that’s what’s going on when your behavior suddenly changes. So unfortunately, it’s up to you (or possibly trusted loved ones) to remind them. When/if you talk to your boss and co-workers, keep in mind that this is partly a political issue and they may not feel the same way you do. Focus on how you’re feeling and decide whether it’ll help or hurt the conversation to explain what’s underlying it. And remember, you don’t need to justify your mental health issues to anyone. Think about why this election has hit you so hard. Are you: You may not be able to pin your emotions on anything. But by doing a little digging, you may be able to find some issue that you can start to address. Or at least, knowing what it is you’re freaking out about can make it easier to explain to others what you’re going through. Additionally, talking through your greatest worries can help you to realize that (hopefully), the thing you’re the most afraid of is actually pretty unlikely to happen. (Granted, this is more relevant when you’re stressing that the test you’re taking tomorrow will result in your flunking out of college. I can’t deny that your worries about a powerful, deeply unqualified, insensitive person may be very well-warranted. Nevertheless, talking through your concerns may help.) Speaking of which: Not everyone knows what to do when someone they love is experiencing mental health issues. In fact, there are ~4 million hits on Google for “what not to say to someone with depression and anxiety.” If your loved one is saying all the wrong things, this can exacerbate the problem. Suddenly, in addition to dealing with your emotions and waning energy, you’re begging the person you love to take you seriously and treat you with the love and respect you’re desperate for. So, send them some of those articles to read so they know what not to say to you. Ask them as directly as possible for things you know will help you (hopefully this list helps you find some). And forgive them for their mistakes.",2017
Second Trip By Plane: How Did it Go?,"She looks pretty relaxed right? Hmm, well that wasn’t me yesterday…at least not until we actually got in the air. I have now flown to my home away from home…a hotel, and back home for the weekend, with two more plane rides for sure in front of me. How did I do? It was stressful. San Diego is being bombarded right now by severe storms. So, what was going through my mind as I waited for a delayed plane, and then boarded it finally only to have to wait to take off because five people were at the wrong gate? Yep, this was more along the lines of where I was at. Maybe not that severe. There was a sense of relief when I finally got to board the plane. I wasn’t sure we were even going to make it out that night. A re-routed plane due to weather doesn’t always make it in if the weather continues to mess things up. I was so glad to get the news over the loudspeaker and by phone message that we had a new departure time. I got home late, late, late, but I did get to come home for the weekend. I discovered that none of the flight bothered me this time except for the take-off. Once we were airborne and cruising, I got to work on my computer, stayed busy and alternately listened to music and watched the free television on the plane wi-fi. Oh, and I had a beer to mellow me out. So now I get to give kudos to a co-worker who helped me during take-off. She sat beside me until we were in the air, and in spite of telling me she isn’t a coddler, she held my hand through take-off. This greatly reduced my stress because it kept me from retreating completely into my head and letting my little general, i.e. imagination, run away with me. Thank you Veronica for being a rock star supporter in my anxiety! The flight went just fine. I got home to my husband picking me up at the airport and got to spend a great weekend with my family in wonderful San Antonio weather. It was a beautiful weekend. Now, its time to go again..back to San Diego and work. Another flight is in front of me and I am nervous. I dreamt about the plane ride last night, and yes, my mind came up with all kinds of crazy scenarios. Here is what I realized though. It was less than before. Each time it gets a little bit better. Each time more fear is stripped out of me and I can actually see the potential of hitting a place where the idea of flying is a fun experience even in my mind instead of something to be concerned about. I look forward to that day because there are a lot of wonderful places to see and most of them are best reached by plane! More on the flip side of this next plane ride!",2017
How Do You Know If You’re Obsessed With Your Health?,"Most of us worry about our health at some point. You may notice a new symptom or change in your body and become convinced it’s a sign of a horrible illness; a loved one might become ill and you might worry it may also happen to you. In fact, it can be helpful to be concerned about your health. This is the type of concern that might motivate you to visit your doctor to check a sore back, apply sunscreen to prevent skin cancer, eat well, exercise or drink enough water. Usually, worries about your health are short-lived and disappear after symptoms go away or after you receive the all clear from your doctor. But for some people, what starts as a normal health concern can tip over into a serious mental health problem you might know as hypochondria, health anxiety or to give it its official title, illness anxiety disorder. So how can you tell if your health concerns are helpful or harmful? And where can you go for help? Illness anxiety disorder involves an overwhelming, disabling and crippling fear of illness and is a new psychiatric disorder listed in the latest edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, known as DSM-5. Illness anxiety disorder replaced the contentious diagnosis of hypochondriasis in previous versions of the DSM. The new label, which is also sometimes referred to as severe health anxiety or health anxiety for short, is less stigmatising, and better reflects the fact anxiety about illness is at the heart of this condition. Like any mental health condition, answer the following questions to see if your anxiety has become a problem: Do you ever Google your symptoms or check your body a lot for illness signs and symptoms? Are you very careful about what and where you eat because you are afraid you might get sick? Do you seek a lot of reassurance from friends, loved ones or health professionals about your health, or go straight to the doctor as soon as you notice a change in your body? Or do you simply spend a lot of time thinking about your health, dreading the idea you may become sick? These things aren’t necessarily a sign of anything unusual, but if they happen too often or start affecting your quality of life, they might be a signal you need to seek help and support. We published data from an Australian population survey that found illness anxiety affects 5.7% of Australians at some point in their lives. That’s over one million people. As well as placing a burden on the individual, it places a burden on society due to excessive health care use. There is also little community awareness it exists. And it is often misdiagnosed as a “personality trait” rather than a treatable condition. The illnesses people fear are vast and varied. While the creative ways the mind interprets what is going on the body can be fascinating, it’s also troubling how debilitating this condition can be. Some people are terrified of having cancer, heart defects, HIV or other STIs, despite repeated reassurance and negative test results. Others are anxious they have neurological conditions and dementia despite all evidence pointing to the contrary. Some are convinced they have parasites, mental illnesses and even Ebola. Most people with illness anxiety frequently seek health care, with higher overall rates of health service use in people with illness anxiety compared to the general population. But people may also avoid health care because they are terrified of finding out they are sick. Illness anxiety can be successfully treated using cognitive behavioural therapy or CBT, a kind of therapy that teaches new ways of thinking and behaving. In CBT, we teach people how to recognise the symptoms of illness anxiety, and practical strategies to overcome the thoughts, worries and unhelpful behaviours (like excessive counterproductive body checking) that make illness anxiety worse in the long term. The aim of CBT is not to take away all anxiety but to help people live a normal, healthy life without the dread of illness hanging over them. If you are considering CBT, the first step is to see a doctor you trust for a general health check, and to rule out serious illnesses. You can receive CBT in face-to-face sessions at specialist anxiety clinics or with experienced psychologists. Recent research shows self-help and online treatment also have excellent results. Self-help resources and comprehensive online CBT programs are now available in Australia.

What To Do When You Feel Overwhelmed,"If everyone was satisfied with himself, There would be no heroes. — Mark Twain I found myself feeling a little more stressed than normal. I was starting to feel overwhelmed with everything that I had on my plate. It was getting to the point that I was not seeing much regeneration or preparation time on my calendar, compared to the deadlines and commitments. I was a little, how should I say it… testy? No, that’s not it…. grumpy? …. Well, yes, but not quite the right word…. How about irritable… cranky… cantankerous… ill-tempered…even sulky? If there was a word to capture all of these, then that was me. To be clear, I was not a fun person to be with. Because of my commitments, I was starting to feel sorry for myself, and not doing what I knew I should have been doing to counteract the stress. I had even put off going for my daily runs, which usually helped me to clear my head and put things in perspective. It was getting to the point where I was starting to blame other people for my problems. It was about 9 in the morning, and I was having one of my …moments, when my wife in her very subtle (direct) way said, “You know what you need? You NEED to get away for a little while. Why don’t you go for a run? That usually helps you clear your mind.” Really what I think she was saying was, “If you don’t get out of here, I’m going to throw something at you.. something big and hard and heavy.” What a great idea, I thought, and off I went. It is difficult to explain the feeling that I get when I ran, it was so exhilarating and cleansing for my mind and body. I chose to take what I called “The Trail”, which was an 8-kilometre route through the forest and along the Kennebacasis River. It was beautiful any day, but this day it was especially stunning. The leaves still had their red and gold tinge before the drab and pale yellow took effect. It was a little chilly, the perfect temperature for me to run, and the sky was about the bluest that I have ever seen. When I started running, I instantly felt better. About 4 kilometres into my run, it hit me hard what was happening to me. So hard in fact, I stopped running (something that I never do) and just stood there in the middle of the trail and started to take stock of my situation. “Paul my boy, what has happened to you?” I said, “I know that you know better than this! It’s time that you started to get things back into perspective, before it gets too far that you can’t.” So, that is what I did. I searched for a tree, the largest tree that I could find, I sat on the ground, my back to the tree and just sat there for a moment thinking about what was happening and then creating an action plan to elevate myself from the abyss that I had fallen into. As I sat there, I felt the tree swaying in the breeze. Each time the wind whispered through the forest, the tree would answer back with its own whispers, but as big as the tree was, it swayed and bent and responded to the pressures of nature by moving with the wind and not against it or by standing rigid and un-flexible. The reason that it could sway and bend like it did was because it had very solid roots that reached out into the ground many metres from the base of the tree that helped it absorb the pressure. What a stunning revelation that was for me. “I must learn to move WITH the pressures of life, not against them. I need to become more solidly rooted by becoming more aware of my strengths and abilities.” I thought. In effect I needed to lose to win. After about 15 minutes of contemplation, I was a new person. Well, not really a new person, I was back to my old familiar attitudes… I was me again! I still had my challenges, (that is what I decided to call them instead of problems) but I wasn’t blaming anyone else for them. I was taking charge over my own life again. I made the choice right then and there, if things were going to change, I had to change. I couldn’t blame anyone for how I felt, I had to own it, and improve on it. Here is what I decided to do: 1. I will now stop feeling and start doing. 2. I will now take stock of my strengths and abilities (my roots), and focus on what I can do instead of what I can’t. 3. I will now accept the inevitable, (the wind is going to blow), and develop the skills that will allow me to be more flexible when faced with pressures. 4. I realize and accept that things are as they are today, and realize that it is easier to create tomorrow, than to change today (trees have been here since the beginning of time, just as strong and just flexible as they are today, they don’t worry about things, each day they grow by reaching up towards the sun while they send out more roots). 5. I am creating an action plan that I will use as a map to guide me towards my vision (trees create seeds and release them into the wind not knowing where they will land and take root, not worrying which way the wind is blowing, or how hard. The harder the wind blows, the further the seed will fly!) When feeling trapped and the world seems to be falling in around and on us, why not choose to be flexible and move with the pressures. Let’s look at our strengths not our weaknesses and refuse to blame others for our situations, but take responsibility for it ourselves. After all, we can’t control what others do; we can only control our own actions. Most of all choose to live the best life that we can imagine. Choose one that we can look back on some fine day and say “I’m proud of who I am and who I have become”! Make this your best life ever! A Bit about me… My vision is quite simple: to make an impact on the lives of the people who have been entrusted to me: You (for reading this article), my family and my clients. I coach people. Direct, practical, innovative, meaningful. I coach for excellence. I love what I do… and so do my clients. Over the years I’ve noticed that business coaching that was supposed to make us stronger actually took away our confidence and made us doubt ourselves. Confidence and people skills aren’t developed just by measuring and planning everything, they grow through doing and learning from experience and by taking risks. People want to make a difference. Build teams. Be better understood. Live more confidently. I founded IBC Impact Business Communication Inc. to create a world where business people communicate and act with confidence to create better worlds for themselves. Worlds where they feel powerful and free to express themselves. Worlds where something as simple as conversation creates energy, understanding and impact. Worlds so exquisite, I couldn’t imagine doing anything else.

Saying “No” to Myself,"When I opened my eyes, the light was on. I could tell it was still dark outside, but I couldn’t recognize the room around me. There was a man standing in the corner. He was featureless and completely black, like a shadow. He didn’t move. I couldn’t move. My eyes were searching around the room. I looked down and saw blood all over my hands, but I couldn’t work out where it was from. I became aware of my body being filled with an unshakeable certainty that I was going to die. To most people who have suffered from panic attacks before, this feeling of life-threatening dread will be all too familiar. Yet it remains impossible to describe to those on the outside. Sometimes it can creep up on you, swelling and swelling until you can no longer hold it in. Or it can hit you fast and hard, like a car crash. It could happen anywhere: in an elevator, in a crowded supermarket aisle, walking down the street. Every little fiber in your body is screaming, telling you to run. And sometimes, the episodes can visit you in your dreams. I’d had nightmares before, but nothing had filled me with the primal fear I had experienced in that room. Half awake, half asleep. Nothing was real. My bedroom was unfamiliar. But I experienced every little emotion, every rise and fall in terror like I was still awake. I couldn’t breathe. I was convinced something was trying to kill me. I was living by myself at the time, so I awoke crying from my panic attack at 4 A.M., alone in a cold, dark room and 200 miles away from my family. I went about the rest of my day, but I couldn’t shake the night terror from my mind. I’m not “crazy,” I have severe anxiety. I was always a creative child. Even today, I can conjure up worlds, people and situations so easily in my mind that they almost dance before my eyes. But, like a deal made with a strange witch in a fairytale wood, there’s a cost that comes with having such an overactive and often out-of-control imagination. Just as my mind can create stories full of fairies, elves and whatever else my pre-teen self was occupied with, it can also create monsters. The shadow creeping out from under my bed was a sharp-toothed clown. That noise coming from the boiler in the cupboard was a vengeful robot made of rusty tin cans with knives for hands. Some of the thoughts were understandably upsetting, like the anxiety I dealt with when my parents separated, for example. Others were so overtly ridiculous that I can’t help but laugh at them now. As a kid, I used to panic every time an ambulance drove past me on the street. I’ve heard from other people that they also jump to scary conclusions such as, “maybe it’s my loved one,” but my second thought was always “but what if I got run over by a car and I’m dead, and I just don’t know it yet?” As I grew into adulthood, the elves became lofty aspirations and the frightening clowns became an overwhelming fear of failure, amongst many other things. The anxiety has always been there, but it wasn’t until I moved into the busy metropolis of London that it became unbearable. Walking past any group of people was an impossible task. Any sound of laughter must have been at my expense. I loved my lectures, but seminars were my special idea of hell. It felt like my mind had been enveloped in one thick, grey cloud. There are always lots of thoughts constantly rushing through my mind, but I can never pick out a single one. The possibilities and opportunities that my imagination gave me were being destroyed by this dark illness, and no one seemed to understand how serious it was. One of the biggest issues about growing up with anxiety without knowing you have it is that it begins to blur the line between what is normal and what is unhealthy. It wasn’t until seeing a therapist did I realize my need to constantly present myself well was yet another physical symptom. Small quirks that have always been there, like walking with my eyes on the floor, biting my nails, and not being able to sit still meant that anxiety has partly shaped who I am as a person. But that was just the beginning. After a year in London with money troubles, arguments and difficulty adjusting, we found out that one of the most important people in my world had cancer. When I opened up to my therapist about it, he told me I was describing my trauma to him as if I was describing a chair. Anxiety had taught me to be obsessed with self-managing and hiding my emotions so well that I had literally forgotten how to feel them around other people. Looking back, I see that was the point where I began to spiral too far. The anxiety became overtly physical. It felt like I had been staring at a bright, glaring computer screen for too long, and my eyes couldn’t concentrate on one thing. I was having multiple anxiety episodes pretty much every day. For me, a panic attack begins when my neck, wrist and arms feel tingly. There are pins and needles in my legs. My whole body suddenly gets hot and I start sweating. This can happen because I got a call from an unknown number, because someone keeps sending me messages when I am already busy, or because there are suddenly too many people in an elevator. It feels like always being on the brink of tears. I can’t sit still in a meeting, my feet are constantly moving and I start picking at the skin on my finger. It feels like being sat in a restaurant, and tearing a napkin into a thousand, tiny white pieces. Like scratches on my wrist where nails have dug in too hard. Like I’ve forgotten how to take long, deep breaths. When it’s really bad, I can’t move my hands or arms without shaking. My heart is burning a hole in my chest. Heartbreak feels physically painful. Insults bite like bullets and hurt crawls along my skin in prickly goosebumps. I feel lightheaded and nauseous. I want to run but I can’t move, and I don’t have anywhere to go anyway. My back aches, but I haven’t left the house in three days. It feels like a desperate need to be safe but not knowing where to find that safety since an anxiety attack can come from anywhere; in the middle of my seminar in front of 10 complete strangers, alone in my room or out for drinks with my closest friends. It feels like not knowing if I want to be alone or surrounded by people I love the most, and suddenly doubting that those people love me back. It feels like everything in the world is wrong and alien, and I feel numb. It was at the climax of all of this that those childhood monsters came to visit me again. There were nights when I was so sleep deprived that they appeared as hundreds of spiders crawling across my walls, jolting me back awake just as I was about to drift off. If anyone ever tells you that anxiety is just a problem of the mind, it’s impossible to explain just how wrong they are. Anxiety isn’t just a mental illness. For some like me, it can become so out of control that it takes on its own physical form. After a year of crippling, wildly uncontrollable anxiety, it became clear that the best thing I could do was go home. Over the next few months, my anxiety simmered down to a manageable temperature. With each walk through my familiar hometown, another spider began to crawl away. My nails began to grow back. The dark bags under my eyes softened, and I ate real food. I wrote real essays and started numerous new projects. The tin-can robot retired back to his cupboard and the shadow man disappeared. There is no clown under my bed, just the resolute remains of an anxiety-monster that made my life unliveable for two long years. I don’t think it will ever go away, but neither will the lessons I learned about fighting, survival and resilience. Submissions are closed.",2017

But, like a deal made with a strange witch in a fairytale wood, there’s a cost that comes with having such an overactive and often out-of-control imagination. Just as my mind can create stories full of fairies, elves and whatever else my pre-teen self was occupied with, it can also create monsters. The shadow creeping out from under my bed was a sharp-toothed clown. That noise coming from the boiler in the cupboard was a vengeful robot made of rusty tin cans with knives for hands. Some of the thoughts were understandably upsetting, like the anxiety I dealt with when my parents separated, for example. Others were so overtly ridiculous that I can’t help but laugh at them now. As a kid, I used to panic every time an ambulance drove past me on the street. I’ve heard from other people that they also jump to scary conclusions such as, “maybe it’s my loved one,” but my second thought was always “but what if I got run over by a car and I’m dead, and I just don’t know it yet?” As I grew into adulthood, the elves became lofty aspirations and the frightening clowns became an overwhelming fear of failure, amongst many other things. The anxiety has always been there, but it wasn’t until I moved into the busy metropolis of London that it became unbearable. Walking past any group of people was an impossible task. Any sound of laughter must have been at my expense. I loved my lectures, but seminars were my special idea of hell. It felt like my mind had been enveloped in one thick, grey cloud. There are always lots of thoughts constantly rushing through my mind, but I can never pick out a single one. The possibilities and opportunities that my imagination gave me were being destroyed by this dark illness, and no one seemed to understand how serious it was. One of the biggest issues about growing up with anxiety without knowing you have it is that it begins to blur the line between what is normal and what is unhealthy. It wasn’t until seeing a therapist did I realize my need to constantly present myself well was yet another physical symptom. Small quirks that have always been there, like walking with my eyes on the floor, biting my nails, and not being able to sit still meant that anxiety has partly shaped who I am as a person. But that was just the beginning. After a year in London with money troubles, arguments and difficulty adjusting, we found out that one of the most important people in my world had cancer. When I opened up to my therapist about it, he told me I was describing my trauma to him as if I was describing a chair. Anxiety had taught me to be obsessed with self-managing and hiding my emotions so well that I had literally forgotten how to feel them around other people. Looking back, I see that was the point where I began to spiral too far. The anxiety became overtly physical. It felt like I had been staring at a bright, glaring computer screen for too long, and my eyes couldn’t concentrate on one thing. I was having multiple anxiety episodes pretty much every day. For me, a panic attack begins when my neck, wrist and arms feel tingly. There are pins and needles in my legs. My whole body suddenly gets hot and I start sweating. This can happen because I got a call from an unknown number, because someone keeps sending me messages when I am already busy, or because there are suddenly too many people in an elevator. It feels like always being on the brink of tears. I can’t sit still in a meeting, my feet are constantly moving and I start picking at the skin on my finger. It feels like being sat in a restaurant, and tearing a napkin into a thousand, tiny white pieces. Like scratches on my wrist where nails have dug in too hard. Like I’ve forgotten how to take long, deep breaths. When it’s really bad, I can’t move my hands or arms without shaking. My heart is burning a hole in my chest. Heartbreak feels physically painful. Insults bite like bullets and hurt crawls along my skin in prickly goosebumps. I feel lightheaded and nauseous. I want to run but I can’t move, and I don’t have anywhere to go anyway. My back aches, but I haven’t left the house in three days. It feels like a desperate need to be safe but not knowing where to find that safety since an anxiety attack can come from anywhere; in the middle of my seminar in front of 10 complete strangers, alone in my room or out for drinks with my closest friends. It feels like not knowing if I want to be alone or surrounded by people I love the most, and suddenly doubting that those people love me back. It feels like everything in the world is wrong and alien, and I feel numb. It was at the climax of all of this that those childhood monsters came to visit me again. There were nights when I was so sleep deprived that they appeared as hundreds of spiders crawling across my walls, jolting me back awake just as I was about to drift off. If anyone ever tells you that anxiety is just a problem of the mind, it’s impossible to explain just how wrong they are. Anxiety isn’t just a mental illness. For some like me, it can become so out of control that it takes on its own physical form. After a year of crippling, wildly uncontrollable anxiety, it became clear that the best thing I could do was go home. Over the next few months, my anxiety simmered down to a manageable temperature. With each walk through my familiar hometown, another spider began to crawl away. My nails began to grow back. The dark bags under my eyes softened, and I ate real food. I wrote real essays and started numerous new projects. The tin-can robot retired back to his cupboard and the shadow man disappeared. There is no clown under my bed, just the resolute remains of an anxiety-monster that made my life unliveable for two long years. I don’t think it will ever go away, but neither will the lessons I learned about fighting, survival and resilience. Submissions are closed.",2017
A phobia is taking over my life,"Hi. My name is Joe. And I’m an anxietist. I’m sort of an above average Joe. Decent education, decent job, decent girlfriend, decent life. Satisfied. I would be happy, if it weren’t for my all-consuming irrational fear of dying a horrible death. It leads me to do crazy things. I once pulled my girlfriend off a plane 5 minutes before takeoff. And nothing happened. I once left a movie theater mid-film. And nothing happened. I once drove halfway across the country to visit my parents in the middle of the night because I was sure something bad would happen in my apartment building. And. Nothing. Happened. What’s even worse is, that after I experience these sort of panic attacks, I avoid getting in those situations again. So I just avoid planes. And movie theaters. And my apartment. Obviously, my anxiety cripples me. And unfortunately, I am not the only one affected by this. My loved ones also suffer greatly. So I have decided to seek help, and I see this as my first step to self-help: Admit you have a problem. Check. All the best, Joe.",2017
100 Words on Anxiety,"I can’t say if it’s the fourth consecutive day of dense fog or the too-fast-approaching end of the month or if it’s last night’s wild dreams, but I woke up today with this sense of something gone wrong and I can’t seem to shake the feeling that the other shoe is about to drop. Anxiety isn’t a big issue for me, so I’m not worried about it beyond how it makes me feel that I’m off my game today. Whenever I feel this way (and it’s almost always when I first wake up), the only thing I know how to do is to just push that much harder to be productive and get stuff done today. Once I clear the first few hurdles, the feeling eases.",2017
Love is like a film,"Love is like a film. The story is flashing before your eyes and sometimes you want it to keep going and sometimes you want it to stop. You might think I am crazy, but I want you to know that I am not. I am simply a hopeless romantic. There are days that I look at people and I swear I can see what would happen if I fell in love with them. In my head, I can picture holding their hand. I can picture them laughing at my jokes even when they’re not funny. I can picture them snuggled next to me in my bed or theirs as we watch a film that we may love or we may hate. I can picture them crying when they tell me why they’re upset. I can picture how the story might end. Sometimes it ends peacefully. Most of the times it doesn’t. The problem with my picture is that they’d be nothing like that in reality. In reality, those moments would be a lot shittier, and I know that. I know how bad my anxiety can get. I know how I can get. I know that when I hold their hand I am thinking about how terrified I am of losing them, how I just never want to let go. When they laugh at my jokes, I hope they’re funny. I hope I don’t go overboard. I hope I am not making a fool of myself. When I picture being them snuggled up next to me, I know that I wouldn’t always be watching the film. Fifty percent of the time I would be wondering what they’re thinking about. I’d be thinking about how I could see myself with this person for a long time. I’d be wondering if they’re okay. I hope they’re okay. When I picture how the story might end, I know it won’t end peacefully. I know that it would leave me in tears. I know that I would pace back and forth until my feet hurt because losing them would hurt and it would tear me apart. I know that I would blame my stutter. I would blame my anxiety. I would blame myself for how sensitive I am. I would picture them with someone else and how awful it would feel and how much it would eat me alive. I’m not perfect, but when I say things I mean them. When I tell someone I love them I mean it. When I ask if they’re okay fifteen times in five minutes, it’s because I really just want to know if they’re okay. Sometimes I just need to know if they’re okay because if they’re not okay then I’m not okay. They tell me that it’s nothing to worry about, but if they’re worrying about it I’m worrying about it. I’m a mess and I can’t help it.",2017

Entrepreneurial Anguish: The Cost of Doing Business,"Building a business has its price. The image of the confident and outgoing CEO often falls short of reality. Before, during and after the public visibility of business ownership often comes personal self-doubt, stress, and mental anguish. Many business owners don’t readily talk about the distress they feel because they don’t perceive it as a positive for the business. But it’s this very mentality (that whatever you do has to be good for the business) that drives too many business owners over the edge. This very battle was poignantly described in Jessica Bruder’s 2013 article in INC. Magazine “The Psychological Price of Entrepreneurship.” Bruder goes in depth into the phenomenon of depression and suicide in the business world, a telling portrait of the stressors and burdens commonly faced. From sleepless nights to crippling anxiety, many business owners have the added pressure of supporting their families as well as the livelihood of their employees and even their communities. And, most business owners aren’t short on “extracurricular activities” as well: they sit on Boards, belong to clubs, and are politically active (just to name a few). As a business grows, so do the responsibilities of the owner, and it is this very problem which leads so many entrepreneurs to question their worth. Bruder notes that there are steps entrepreneurs can take, however, to combat depression and anxiety in the business world, such as taking expert advice, asking for help, limiting personal investment and allowing yourself to make mistakes. The life of an entrepreneur is complex; you face ups and downs on a daily basis. You are responsible not only for yourself and your family but for the health and vitality of your business. A tall order for many. Following expert advice and learning about others’ struggles is a great way to stave off anxiety and depression. It is also important to do what you can to protect yourself and limit your liabilities. Shameless Plug: A good place to start is by speaking with a lawyer about what you can do to protect your interests as an entrepreneur. The internal struggles of entrepreneurs are not as publicized as their external successes or failures. The complexity of the business world is one that is best appreciated from the inside. But, at the end of the day, the rewards of owning and operating a successful business can be considerable. You get to make your mark on the world, be your own boss, and stand up on your own two feet. You get to support your community as an employer and touch the lives of countless others. And ideally, you’ll have created something that will live on, as your legacy on this earth, long after you’re gone. Which, to me, is the most valuable asset anyone can have.

In Loving Memory of a Jedi Warrior Princess: Lindsay M Hawley,"A friend of mine, Lindsay M. Hawley, passed away by choice on the first day of this year. January 1, 2017. I haven’t been able to stop crying lately and today my thoughts were consumed by her. I have never lost a friend before, and have definitely never lost anyone to suicide. Sometimes writing helps me sort through my thoughts and feelings, so I wrote this. Maybe it will help just one person to read it as it helped me to write it. It was a normal day, just like any other day. I was in my standard seated position with my standard carry-on bag in a standard airport. I took out my phone and glanced at my Facebook feed, expecting to mindlessly scroll for a few minutes through some combination of the usual: Corgi video, inspirational quote, baby picture, catchy clickbait article via George Takei. Instead, my heart stopped. I had to gasp for air because my body had suddenly forgotten how to breathe. Hands shaking like crazy, I searched for proof that what I was seeing wasn’t true. “Rip sweet beautiful angel.” “The few months we worked together has left a lifetime of impressions on me about how one should live. You are an inspiration. My daughter will know all about you, and will have you as a model to live by. Thank you for being a bigger part of my life than you would ever know. #livelikelindsay” “The world honestly confuses me sometimes. Perhaps a light that burns as brightly as yours just can’t be contained on this planet. I hope you’ve found a happy place to rest. Much love to you and all that are feeling your loss.” I made a phone call. This can’t be true. It can’t. This is bullshit. There has to be another reason for this nonsense, some explanation that makes sense. “Ivy, she killed herself.” What? No. No, no, no. NO. Please, no… We had talked just days before. I’d invited her to go snowboarding with me from January 1–7. She said that she couldn’t because she had to prep for her new client, Kodak, and needed to start work for Sundance, but we’d definitely go play in the snow together sometime this season. She’d updated me on how it was going with two of the guys I’d connected her with a few months earlier via my matchmaking efforts: She was a fiercely alive, badass Jedi warrior princess. And now she is gone. Forever. Frozen in time at the age of 28. To suicide. I could say a lot of things about Lindsay M Hawley, but none of them would even come close to doing her justice. Words on a screen feel so damn flat, unable to even come close to capturing the essence of this phenomenal force of a woman. So here’s an attempt to share who she was, in her own flesh, in her own voice. Her epic selfie fail speedboating around Necker Island: In her travels around the world, with old friends and making new ones: On Savvy Stylish Shopping, with visits to her favorite resale shops in San Diego: On finding your purpose from your story: Via her blog, Live More Happy (LMH, her initials): Including entries about how she affords to travel around the world (by thrifting, hustling, and sacrificing stability for the unknown and material things for adventure). How she coped after being cheated on and lied to by her soon-to-be-fiance. Her battle with anxiety, attempts to connect with her alcoholic mother, and determination to heal by trying different ways of taking care of herself. Lindsay felt so deeply, along with a massive responsibility to do so much. Whenever she saw pain or felt suffering in the world, she felt a personal obligation to do something about it. And so she did, again and again and again. Collecting clothing donations for the homeless. Rescuing a puppy from the side of the road, getting it medical treatment, and making sure it was adopted into a loving home. Participating in Bows for a Cause, to help children with cancer. Launching a fundraiser to help raise money for her stepmother Sue’s breast cancer treatment. Championing and contributing to the Spay Neuter Action Project (SNAP San Diego), Peruvian Hearts Foundation, WildCoast, Sports for Exceptional Athletes of San Diego, Urban Angels Volunteer group, Connections Housing of San Diego, Global Wildlife Conservation, and the Door of Faith orphanage in Baja, Mexico: She was always there as a friend and confidante. Cheering up friends going through breakups with “girls only getaways” to nourishing spaces filled with sunshine and surf. Encouraging both soulmates and strangers to get through the shitty times, to hang in there, to get out of ruts by helping others, and to recognize your infinite potential and to act on it. She believed in others, and in seeing themselves through her eyes, they were able to believe in themselves. Whoever knew her, loved her. I realize how cliche and cheesy this sounds, but it’s the absolute truth: Lindsay left behind her younger brother Kellen, who she adored and was determined to help through school, and her father and stepmother. You can send support directly to her family here. Stay connected with Lindsay’s projects and passions here. #livelikeLindsay I’ve been thinking about her non-stop since I found out she killed herself. And feeling. A lot. Sadness. Confusion. Guilt. Frustration. Anger. And fear. Fear because when I look at Lindsay, I see reflections of myself and others who I know and love. Someone who said yes to everything and had a hard time saying no if it meant hurting someone else’s feelings, even if that meant it hurt her. Someone who gave and gave and gave to other people and causes, pouring from her heart and soul and spirit and wallet, but had a hard time receiving, finding it difficult to ask for support or to accept help for herself. Someone who struggled with connection, who had a million friends and genuinely wanted to, tried to, and did love, but who sometimes suffered from anxiety and isolation, imposter syndrome, feeling disconnected from others and from herself, and trying to fill the emptiness with self-help workshops, gurus, conferences, parties, events, adventures, and numbing distractions. Someone who was beautiful on the inside and the outside but had challenges with making romantic relationships work. Someone who lived an enviably glamorous life on FaceBook and Instagram, who went to Necker Island to kick it with Richard Branson, ran around Downtown Vegas with Tony Hsieh, sipped exotic drinks on the beaches of beautiful islands and went on fancy fun adventures around the world, whose light other people marveled at and who others wanted to be. Someone who was always there for everyone except herself. I wonder if anyone else out there can relate. We all have darkness. A shadow side. Parts of ourselves that we are ashamed of, afraid of, concerned that anyone else might see or find out about. In this day and age where our lives are seemingly under a microscope, available to all for inspection 24/7, there can be crushing pressure to look the right way (perfectly filtered, obviously), do the right thing (make tons of money doing what you love, find and marry the perfect partner, be a perfect parent with a thriving career and thriving children, travel to luxurious vacation destinations and attend fabulous events, be a martyr and sacrifice your own needs for the needs others), and hang out with the right people (because hanging with cool/rich/hot people makes everyone think you are cool/rich/hot by default). There’s more pressure than ever before to deny and hide our struggles, insecurities, and imperfections because God forbid anyone find out at times we struggle with confidence, money, relationships, addiction, parenting, body image, self-love. I don’t think that darkness is a bad thing. It’s part of who we are. Our darkness can teach us a lot about ourselves, about who we are and what we need. Acknowledging it makes us whole. It only becomes a problem when we deny it, mask it, hide it, avoid it, and pretend it doesn’t exist in order to pretend we are someone we’re not, someone we think and hope other people will like and accept. It’s exhausting trying to prove over social media or in person that we’re good enough, likable enough, and worthy of attention, care, and love. It’s a dangerous game to constantly judge which parts of us are good or bad, right or wrong, trying to keep what’s okay and shove away what’s not, when the different parts of ourselves aren’t anything except what they are, and that’s okay. Once we look at and own both our light and darkness, we can finally be seen. Really, truly seen. Which brings about peace and freedom. Peace because you are no longer fighting, exerting energy to be someone you are not, telling half-truths and living a half-life as a result in an attempt to appear perfect. Freedom because once you no longer give a fuck, you can be (or continue to figure out) who you actually are, not who you or anyone else (family, friends, religion, social media) thinks you should be. There isn’t a definitive destination with an endpoint and gold star once you get there. There’s nowhere to get. Bravely looking at, accepting, and embracing both your light and your darkness is a lifelong journey, a daily practice, and one that you will probably mess up again and again and again. I know I do. You can too. And that’s okay. Suicide doesn’t make any sense. The impact of it never fully goes away and it permanently changes those who are left behind. Once again, I feel like what I’m saying sounds cliche, but it’s the truth. If you kill yourself, those who know and knew you will never, ever be the same again. Our mutual friend Chelsey described suicide “like releasing a hand grenade directly into the hearts of the people who loved you most.” Accurate. If you are struggling or feeling overwhelmed right now, please, please, please reach out for support. Right now. Without thinking or hesitation. To that one person in your life who will pick up at 3am who would never judge you (this is usually the same person who you would do the same for). Tell them what sucks. What hurts. What’s really going on. They will listen, and they will love you. Because you are cherished, worthy, loved, and so very precious. You can also reach out to a caring stranger who will pick up your call anytime via the National Suicide Prevention Hotline at 1–800–273–8522 or any of these international suicide crisis hotlines. They want to talk to you. Seriously. I volunteered at the Suicide Prevention Line in Culver City for five years. If you don’t call, we literally just sit around nibbling on slightly stale Fig Newtons while staring at each other across the table. We aren’t there for that. We are there for you. To listen to you, to hear you, and to care about you. You can also reach the Crisis Text Line by texting “START” to 741–741. If you want, you can reach out directly to me: http://www.bareivy.com/ I promise I will respond in 24 hours or less. And now, I’m just going to leave this here. Because #truth. I miss you, Lindsay. I am trying to do your memory justice and to heal my own heart by sharing your life and your spirit with as many people as I possibly can. I know that you would be stoked if it helps even one person who reads it. Thank you for making my life brighter by shining your light and better by sharing your darkness. May you have forever peace, precious Jedi Warrior Princess.",2017
An Open Letter to Anxiety,"[Trigger warning: descriptions of anxiety and panic attacks] You first came to me when I was 16. It was nighttime, and my mind was racing. You didn’t announce yourself, you crept up on me instead. You were unlike anything I had ever felt before in the worst possible way, and I thought I was going to die. Anytime I wanted to go to school, or to see my friends, or to do anything, you were right there blocking me and telling me over and over again that I couldn’t. I hated you so much, but for a long time you became my only company. On my bedroom floor. In the school bathroom. But mostly in the middle of the night, when I was alone with my thoughts. That’s when you liked to visit me the most. You made me feel the worst I’ve ever felt in my life. You made me look different too. I couldn’t look in the mirror anymore because the circles under my eyes scared me. I didn’t even notice how skinny I was getting. You would crawl into bed and wrap yourself around me to the point where I could no longer breathe. Then you would wake me up from what little sleep I had with aching limbs and no appetite. They tried giving me medication to get rid off you, but it just made me feel nothing at all so I threw it away. I just wanted to feel like myself again. I was already losing my confidence and self-esteem when you came to me, and then you took whatever was left of it. Teachers started noticing. My parents noticed too. I tried talking about you to my best friend but he didn’t get it. I think it was hard for other people to think of you as real when I was the only one that could feel you. So I stopped talking about you at all. Nobody said a thing, because this was so out of character for me. The usually happy and relatively normal 16 year old girl who was at the top of her class was suddenly crumbling under the pressure of it all, and nobody understood why. Not even myself. For a long time I thought I would be alone in the darkness forever, but then the first weekend after school started my mum suggested that we go to the beach. I really didn’t want to because I had been locked up in my room most days away from you and that’s the only place I found comfort. If I left, then maybe you could reach me again. But I decided to go anyway. We went to a beach town called Bundoran where I spent most of my childhood. You had been with me all morning, but when I arrived at the beach I couldn’t find you. I spent what felt like 10 minutes but what was actually an hour walking by the water’s edge, and it was almost like I was looking for you because I expected you to be everywhere I went. But the more I walked the more the thoughts of you drifted away and for the first time in weeks, I didn’t think of you at all. I looked at the endless mass of ocean and sky and thought about how beautiful it is when the sunlight hits the water. I looked at my parents in the distance and counted my blessings. I thought about my future, and how it was as wide open and overwhelming as the view in front of me, but for the first time in weeks it didn’t scare me anymore. Neither did the thought of you. You held a magnifying glass up to the things that I was afraid of, and you made them seem traumatizing. But when I was so sensitive to the things that I was scared of, it meant that I appreciated the smaller things in life even more too. Leonard Cohen once wrote “There’s a crack in everything. That’s how the light gets in.” You cracked me open, but in a strange way I am thankful that you did. Finding appreciation in the smallest things is what helped me realize the bigger things aren’t as terrifying as they seem. I breathed in the coastal air and let it take whatever was left of you. I felt the warmth of the sunlight comfort me and it reminded me of the power of self care. I wish I could say that was the last day I ever saw you, but you came back to me time and time again over the next 3 years. Except this time it was different, because I started fighting back. I started opening up to friends and family, and they started to understand. I drowned myself in inspiration, and the things that made me feel content like the simple act of reading a book or finding an amazing song that expressed the emotions I couldn’t explain. They showed me the way to the light, and I let it fill up my cracks until I felt whole again. I didn’t realize it at the time but that simple act of going to the beach that day took an insurmountable amount of courage, and so I started praising myself for doing the smallest things like getting out of bed and going to school. At the time they felt the biggest things in the world. But I took it day by day, sometimes minute by minute. And in the comforting words of loved ones and the strength that I found in myself, I felt you fade away. This is a goodbye letter to you, and all the control you had on my life. I thought you would be around forever, but time has a way of healing things. I don’t think you’re gone forever and even though this is the first year since I was 16 where I haven’t felt you at all, I’m sure there will be days ahead where you creep back up. But it’s different now, because I like to think of you like this. Before you were this intangible feeling that I could not control but I’m brave enough now to address you. When I feel you coming on again, I picture you in my head as a shape and as I breathe in and out I envision you getting smaller and smaller until you’re completely gone. Sometimes I’ll just tell you out loud that you’re nothing to me, and you’ll disappear. It’s funny how that works. One day you were this overbearing weight on me that I couldn’t control. Now you’re nothing. And I’m free.",2017
Why I Measure My Mental Health in Balloons,"It’s late Friday night. Sharp rain whips against the window. Rochelle sits alone in her apartment. She’s crying. Playing the same scene over and over again. The same terror of his fist rising to meet her, the same pain of flesh cracking against flesh, the same panicked thought repeating on an endless loop: “My boyfriend just beat me and I don’t know what to do.” After hours alone, Rochelle does the same thing she always does when she doesn’t know what else to do. She calls Stacy. They’d been best friends since high school, inseparably entwined in the kind of tight sisterhood you only form by going through literally everything together. If anybody knew what to do, it would be her. Of course, Stacy knows just what to do: Step up and be strong in exactly the same way that Rochelle had been strong for her so many times before. For the next few days, Rochelle struggles to pull together any semblance of strength at all for very long. The confusion and despair of a multitude of conflicting emotions cause her far more pain than even the deepest of her bruises, the sharpest of her cuts, or the most damaged of her broken ribs. Depression seeps into her being like a thick, toxic tar, anxiety hijacks her nervous system, and being ‘strong,’ at least for the time being, just isn’t an option. Not that she has to be right now, because Stacy has strength in abundance. At least on the outside. As the days morph into weeks, she does much more than offer up a shoulder to cry on and an ear to listen. She does much more than offer emotional support to her friend, she does everything: Taking care of Rochelle’s two young children, keeping her house straight and her domestic life in order, all the while looking after her own children and holding down a job. Outwardly, she gives an air of invincibility. Even on the surface of her thoughts, Stacy doesn’t seem to feel anything but love, loyalty and compassion. Somebody had to step up right now, and that somebody just had to be her. Beneath that surface however, something is going on that even Stacy herself isn’t really aware of. Every night that she stays up with Rochelle into the early hours before getting an hour’s sleep, sending the kids off to school and then clocking in for her own shift at work is beginning to cause chinks in her armor. Every time she sits with Rochelle through another crippling anxiety attack, the chinks grow bigger. Through them, enough bad feeling and terrible memories -suppressed thoughts of her own abusive relationship with her father- begin to slip through and affect Stacy more than she realizes. Not that she could have realized it if she wanted to. There simply isn’t time. She is in a situation that demands she dig deep into whatever reserves of strength she had and simply deal with what is in front of her. There is no time for reflection. No time to say “excuse me while I tend to how I feel,” stuff has to be done, and she is busy doing it. Outwardly, nobody would have ever know that something bad was beginning to bubble beneath herself. Even Stacy herself is only vaguely aware of it, suppressing it deep every time it got too close by simply dealing with the next thing in front of her. Weeks pass. Rochelle begins to regain her strength, and to find enough positivity to help Stacy plan a small birthday party for one of the children. It’s just them, Rochelle, Stacy, and the children. A small stack of gifts sits neatly by the TV, party food rests neatly on a table against a wall decorated with a huge “Happy Birthday” banner. In each corner of the room stand three helium balloons; one red, one blue, one white. Rochelle looks out at each balloon, remembers back to the moment -only a few hours earlier- when Stacy brought them home with her, wrestling her way through the door, three balloons in each hand and a third set waiting out in the corridor. One red, one blue, one white. Stacy too looks out at the balloons, she’s reminded of the traffic jam she got stuck in on the ride over to pick them up. That had been stressful, but hey, it was worth it, all for the sake of putting a smile on the faces of those she loved. Just three simple, helium balloons. One red. One blue. One…BANG! A balloon bursts, and so does Stacy. While everyone around is mildly and momentarily startled, that one little balloon popping sends Stacy into a breakdown. She collapses on the sofa, sobbing uncontrollably, fragile, trembling, a wreck. Years later, she would tell your narrator “I just fucking lost it” That one little balloon popping had ripped the chinks in Stacy’s armor wide open, finally exposing all that suppressed stress, those dark feelings and bad memories. Everything she’d been too busy to deal with while she was stepping up and being strong had joined forces and confronted her all at once, surrounded her, forced her to finally deal with how she was feeling. She wept, she shook, she broke down, and she broke down hard. “Oh, Stacy,” said Rochelle, emphatically. “You’ve been so strong throughout all this, that balloon just pushed you over the edge.” Rochelle dove onto the sofa, grabbed Stacy in a sisterly embrace, held her. They would continue to be each other’s tower of strength, only from now on, it would be different. From now on, they would promise to help each other key check on their balloons, and to be there on those occasions when one unexpectedly burst. That story, as best as I can remember it, is entirely true, told to me by Stacy on a day when one of my own balloons happened to burst. I’m certainly not comparing what happened to me to the traumas faced by Rochelle and Stacy. I would never dream of doing so, and that isn’t what I want to do here. What I do want to do, is to tell you why, since that day, I’ve used balloons as my own way of keeping tabs on my mental health. I’m reminded of the old adage that we don’t stumble over mountains, only pebbles. In other words — when we’re faced with something big, something that just has to be dealt with (like Stacy supporting her friend- we find it in us to step up and deal with it. We get over the mountain because we have to. While we’re busy doing that however, conquering that mountain is draining us of some vital inner-energy, the kind of energy that keeps our own demons at bay at our mental health in a good place. It drains it so much that eventually, when things start to calm down, all it takes is a balloon popping for us to “fucking lose it.” It doesn’t have to be a balloon, of course it doesn’t. It could be a shoelace snapping, a comment from a co-worker that rubs us the wrong way, that latest pile of work dumped on our desk, the dishes not being done at home, any number of smaller ‘things’ that are going to tip us over the edge and have us collapsed on the sofa, trembling and crying. When I talk about “My balloons,” I’m talking about the things in my life that have the potential to affect my mental health, even in the smallest way. The things in my life that could just be the tipping point if I’m not taking care of myself. For me personally, my balloons could be individual clients that I work with at my small business, the list of household tasks that need doing, friends and family members who have a bad habit of stressing me out, any number of things. I think of them, and I think of Stacy’s story. It think of the need to be mindful of my own mental health, to check in on my balloons. Are they ready for popping? Have I been neglecting the way I feel, trying to ignore it, to carry on regardless? Am I so busy dealing with everything going on around me that I’m forgetting to deal with how I actually feel about it? Will ignoring it eventually cause me to freak out and collapse when a balloon pops or I burn my dinner or an unexpected bill drops through the door? Sometimes, I can recognize a bout of depression, or anxiety, or a period of high stress and still not doing anything about it. I get into the frame of mind that it’s simply the sheer amount of stuff that’s causing me stress, and that if I simply get it all done, I’ll feel much better. Whilst I can’t deny that stuff does have to be done, doing it all without taking a step back to tend to my health isn’t going to benefit me in the long-run. All it means, is that when all that stuff is done, I’m still going to be so worn down that all it will take is a balloon popping, or my phone battery dying, or my laptop crashing, to send me over the edge into a full blown collapse. Sometimes, I can recognize a situation where one of my balloons has become so inflated that it’s taking up a disproportionate amount of time, stress, and anxiety compared to the benefits of having it in my life. In those cases, I have to be prepared to cut the rope and let those balloons go. Sometimes that might be a person, a project, or even an inanimate object, if I look at or think about this thing and I’m aware that this balloon could pop at any moment and make me “fucking lose it” like Stacy did, then I have to get rid of it. Just let it go, out of my life. By doing so, I’m free to deal with what really matters, like keeping my own mental health in good order, and being there for other people just like Stacy was there for Rochelle.",2017
When It’s More Than Just Shyness,"When did that innocence fade I wonder? When did that child take on the weight of being concerned by others’ possible negative judgements about her and the simple joy and freedom in living in the now become imprisoned by the fear of being humiliated or appearing odd, strange, unusual due to the physical symptoms of anxiety? My life as an adolescent and well into my twenties was plagued by Social Anxiety. Social Anxiety is defined as ‘a persistent fear of one or more social or performance situations in which the person is exposed to unfamiliar people or to possible scrutiny by others. The individual fears that he or she will act in a way (or show anxiety symptoms) that will be embarrassing and humiliating.’ (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM–5)). A key symptom of Social Anxiety for me was blushing and, in the true nature of anxiety, this blushing became a conditioned response, guaranteed to occur in association with particular people and in particular situations. Having idolized the late Princess Diana in my childhood, the endearing coyness of her blushing with bowed head was quite a contrast to the immense agony I felt when I tried to appear ‘normal’ despite my face burning with heat and appearing like a glowing red beacon. Shakiness was also an issue and signing my signature in front of others (a regular process in ‘the old days’ in front of a bank teller) could be quite tortuous. For others, symptoms of Social Anxiety can include excessive sweating, stammering when trying to speak, nausea, diarrhea, and dry throat and mouth. Public speaking I found abhorrent — my friends from high school still remind me, good-naturedly, ‘to breathe’ in memory of my abrupt departure from class, mid-speech, due to panic. I bravely faced employment interviews despite the tremors including a sense of being like a bobble toy with a wobbling head. I attended to customer service employment tasks with courage and a bright smile whilst excruciating self-doubt and fear of criticism dominated my mind and body. Social Anxiety held on tightly as I progressed through university studies including a Master of Clinical Psychology. Though continually hyper-vigilant to perceived negative judgement from others, including complete strangers, I successfully completed my studies and employment requirements. My social life however was one with much binge drinking in order to feel at ease as the alcohol worked to soften my paranoia about being poorly received by others. Where does social anxiety come from? Beyond Blue (www.beyondblue.org.au) lists the causes as including temperament with shyness/social inhibition in children/adolescents being a risk factor; family history — a possible genetic predisposition; and learned behaviour — the outcome of poor treatment, public embarrassment or humiliation (e.g. bullying at school). An overactive amygdala has also been linked with social anxiety (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3055419/). Early on in my psychological angst, I realised from my own experimentation with ways to deal with Social Anxiety, an acceptance approach worked best to manage and even reduce the harrowing physical symptoms of the Social Anxiety. Certainly to focus on my blushing or shaking hands only strengthened the intensity of the symptoms. If I was to, figuratively, nod to these symptoms, even welcome them, the paradoxical result was the intensity of the sensations would reduce and I would build my confidence to continue facing each challenging situation. I knew deep down, regardless of my interest in psychology and my undertaking of associated post-graduate studies, that if I was to avoid fear-provoking situations my life would become increasingly narrower and any chance of fulfillment would dissipate as the anxiety would loom even larger. So with such an approach of acceptance, including using breathing techniques which calm the nervous system, and some cognitive restructuring (e.g. I do agree that most people are essentially focused on their own lot rather than a significant focus on me), I have made peace with Social Anxiety. Age has certainly helped and navigating challenging life experiences which have taught me lessons such as: For support, if you can relate to the fears and symptoms I have described above, there are a wealth of relevant websites which can help you to recognise that many, many people suffer from Social Anxiety — it’s the third largest mental health concern in the world(see http://socialphobia.org/social-anxiety-disorder-definition-symptoms-treatment-therapy-medications-insight-prognosis). You can even kick off your capacity to face these challenges with self-help guides online. Do not feel you have to go it alone — reach out to loved ones, to an effective medical practitioner or a mental health practitioner who specialises in this vulnerability. Social Anxiety untreated can certainly connect with depression and, believe me, you don’t want to go down this path if you can avoid it. People with Social Anxiety are an incredibly brave population — I know as I have lived in the shadow of this torment and I can assure you that, with the right approach and support, you can live well.",2017
A Sense of Purpose,"Thomas Joiner, MD has an amazing book called “Why Do People Die by Suicide.” He proposes many theories on the why. People who die by suicide have a desire to die and have overcome the natural instinct we all have for self-preservation. With that desire, he found two things often occurred: there is a perception of being a burden to others and a social disconnect to something larger than oneself (a sense of isolation). Combine that with an acquired capacity, learned ability, or fearlessness, you have someone with a very elevated risk of suicide. Keep in mind that word perception. It is important, as it is how the person views oneself, not necessarily what the world sees. How often when someone dies by suicide do we say, wow, they had so much going for them, or I can’t believe this happened, they were so accomplished, etc. That person often feels they are worth more dead than alive. They lost their sense of purpose. I got thinking about this more today and wanted to talk about that concept and my process of grief. I can’t speak for Jesse, but I will share with you some of my theories and beliefs around his suicide. Jesse had many talents, one of which was his strength, which he would happily boast about and demonstrate. Exercise was a huge part of his life for multiple reasons. One of the many was to balance out his brain chemistry. He was also super smart. You would always want him on your trivia team. In fact, I think my niece texted him during a trivia game to get a few random answers. After the car accident, he was in so much pain physically, which then tied into emotional. After getting a partial permanent disability diagnosis at the age of 33, he was disheartened. He got himself (with guidance from his doc) off the painkillers he was prescribed and then went into a manic episode (his first). After getting a Bipolar 1 diagnosis, alongside the pain in his body that was overwhelming (which very well may have been his new reality of everyday), I believe he gave up. I remember Bella going up to him and asking to get picked up, him trying, and yelping in pain then having to be on an ice pack for hours after. This was not the man who I met who I have a picture of picking both Raffi and I up at the same time. He felt like a burden (not true), he felt like he was worth more dead than alive (not true), he isolated himself from friends and family, and he had the means and know how. Knowing what I know now…hindsight. I have told people time and time again, I get it. After living through the emotional hell I have lived the past almost three years, I understand the mental space he was in. I have had all the above thoughts. I have felt like I am a burden. I cannot tell you how many times I have thought my daughter would be so much better off without a completely fucked up mother. I love her, there is no doubt about that. But the times where I am on the floor sobbing uncontrollably and she is the one comforting me fills me with a guilt that I cannot even express. I worry that I am a burden to my friends and family, that they get sick of having to listen to my sadness, anxiety, ptsd, and my inability to do life at times. I worry that I am not good at my job anymore. Depending on where I am mentally/emotionally, is to how much of a spiral any of the above can go. My rational mind eventually kicks in to dispel all the above. The kicking in can be within minutes, but has taken days. When it takes days, that sense of isolation starts to kick in. I am lucky that I have a core group of people to be on the lookout for that and check in. Not everyone has that. I get it. I get that the mental/emotional pain can be so great that it can override the innate desire to live. What can you do with all of that you may ask? There are no manuals. You don’t get to connect to The Matrix to download instructions on how to “live” when your husband shoots your child then himself and you find them. After, Raffi was my anchor, my reason to live, still is. But that has expanded. When I went back to work, I was reminded that my patients need me. Then, very soon after, I made a decision, a decision that has changed the path of my life dramatically. I decided that I would not let their death be in vain, I went into advocacy work around mental health and suicide awareness. I started doing public speaking, I started my blog, this very blog that you are reading dear reader. I am now on the Suicide Prevention Alliance for the State of OR. I was just in Salem today for a workforce development committee meeting. I was at a meeting around possible legislation that Rep. Keny-Guyer is trying to propose last week alongside a continuity of care committee meeting. I feel like I am finally able to contribute to all the above. My goals are to do more and more public speaking (let me know if you are aware of any opportunities), write a book, continue to give feedback and testify for the above proposed legislation and see it pass (ie. laws around suicide prevention). And yes, I plan on Washington at some point. It is my sense of purpose, my sense of a “belongingness” to something larger than me. I do not want anyone to have to feel this pain, and they should not have to, because if I have learned nothing else, suicide is preventable, and it is my goal to make it so. #ZeroSuicide Please follow and like us: www.lifesnewnormal.com FB — Life’s New Normal Stephanie Willard Originally published at www.lifesnewnormal.com on January 24, 2017.",2017
"Dude ( Read : World/Society/ Bittu Aunty/ apparently well meaning friend )— Anxiety is real, stop dismissing it.","When Pallavi called me a few months back to write about my experiences on anxiety, I had two very mixed emotions. A part of me really wanted to share with a wider audience what anxiety is and isn’t and a part of me was willing to write it on the condition of remaining anonymous. I am glad that I chose to put my name on that piece. I’m glad that I did not hide. I am glad I “owned” it, accepted it and felt no shame in mentioning it. But it wasn’t always like this. When I first started having these attacks, I did not visit the therapist till I was physically unable to continue living. By this, I mean - I was weak, confined to my bed, couldn’t digest food, had NO appetite and I heard demons in my head everyday, all the time, like a CD stuck on repeat, a hollow, eerie, song of jeers that made living impossible. I slept 18 hours a day just because if I woke up, my demons would come back again, sauntering into my life, playing battle field in my head. Sleep was kinder. But apart from my really close friends, no one in college knew. Not for a while atleast. I was the most well dressed during that period. My boots were on, the lipstick shone, the dresses came out, the eyeliner was a sharp wing. I remember this one day when my heart felt like a harpsichord being plucked in a frenzy, I couldn’t breathe without nails being punctured in my gut. I remember walking out of the classroom, waving at a classmate in the corridor, walking with my head held really high even though my insides were leaking with ice cold pain. I remember walking straight till I reached my therapist’s door and then collapsing the moment I entered the room. I did not want anyone to think I was weak. I did not want anyone to dismiss my pain as “drama”. Being anxious was a sign of the weak. I had a good childhood, a privileged life, who was I to complain? I was wrong. See, this is the problem. We believe that only a certain type of event warrants extreme emotions. For example, death. So when someone approaches us, crumbling over a breakup, we nonchalantly tell them,“it’s okay, shit happens, move on”. When a person weeps about losing their job, we hum the same goddamn tone of, “shit happens, move on”. STOP DOING THAT. The only thing you should probably tell someone in grief is that — it gets better. Do not attach a weightage, a timeline to their pain and do not harass them aside for not sticking to it. You are not them and you cannot possibly comprehend how it feels to be them. But give them the sight of “better”. Heck, promise it. One needs to not lose track of the happier days when one is shivering inside a blanket. Help them, recall. One of the singular, most poignant thing that someone has ever told me during a panic attack is — “ But you know it gets better. You know it happens to you, and that you cannot control it but it always gets better”. There is a simple beauty in that sentence. The sentence tells me that, I have it in my own knowledge base, the reality of having seen better days. I have had a history of panic attacks and with it, a history of bouncing back, ALWAYS. What a marvelous thought! If you are reading this and you have anxiety, don’t you fucking forget that. You’ve bounced back every time and you will again. I promise. ( I am going to continue writing a few more pieces on anxiety because I want to work on normalizing it, and removing the stigma associated with it)",2017

Destroy Stress and Anxiety the Islamic way before they Destroy You,"One of the saddest realities of our lives is that stress and anxiety have become normal parts of our life. It is one of the most silent problems that is affecting each and every person in a society albeit in different manners. Stressing for the right reasons such as not missing prayer may not be such a bad thing, but overall these two things can have long lasting and really bad effects on people. Anxiety is a psychological condition for which there are actually medications and though most people think that that is the extent of its harmful effects they are severely wrong. Anxiety can lead to multiple types of diseases including cardiac and digestive issues. Long term stress symptoms include, headaches, acne, chest pains, high blood pressure, fatigue, teeth grinding, depression and of course anxiety. Managing stress is the sure fire thing if you want to live a happy life. Life throws a lot at you and if we get down from everything coming our way, then that can lead to depression. According to Muhammad Faris, the founder of a popular Muslim blog, Productive Muslim, and sufferer of stress at one point in his life, here are 9 steps that you can take to overcome your stress.

Day 21-scared,"I don’t want to self-censor here. I really don’t, and I feel that in the first 20 days I’ve been very honest. But there are some thoughts and feelings that are too hard to put down on paper, and too hard to make real before I process them more. Writing thoughts out makes them real. Speaking them makes them real. Sitting in my head, they can be fake and ethereal and whispy. It sucks because I’d like to tell you how I’m feeling, but I’m scared. And fear prevents us from doing the things that are hard. The things we probably most need to do. I can recognize that and still feel that I’m not ready to share some things and some feelings. I guess it’s things that I’m ashamed of feeling. I’m not ready to say that there is a part of me that is terrified about Khadijah going back to work. That, for the last two years, she’s taken care of our son so well, that they’re this special little team. I think of them as my own little buddy comedy. I can’t really imagine anyone else taking care of him right now, and I hate the idea of day care. And it’s not that I think that we’re perfect parents and that no one can take care of him the way we can, or some shit like that. I don’t. But there is also something perfect about the bond between a mother and a son. Something so strong, yet fragile, that seemingly can’t be replaced by others. They have a relationship that I know I’ll never have. And that’s ok. We have our own relationship that we’re still figuring out. Even at two years, there are weird gender roles and expectations that are happening. Sometimes I wonder if he withholds from me so as not to taint his pure love for his mother. I don’t know if that makes any sense. And there are other things that will get lost when we’re both working. Right now, things have been kind of easy for me. I work, which isn’t too hard, or not as hard as parenting, and then I come home and take some responsibility, and share the parenting. I do the bulk of the early morning routine as well. That said, there is always someone here that I can count on if i need to go to therapy at night, or if I have something else to do. We both take advantage of that, but I do a little more. With her at home, I can go running on some mornings and we figure the rest out. When she goes back to work, that’s going to be much harder. I know that in the first six months of working again, she’ll need a lot of time and space to get settled back into things. I know that the burden of parenting will fall much more on my shoulders than it has so far. I’m ok with this. I’m also scared. I’m scared that our son will reject me. That he won’t accept his new reality. That the dimished time with her will lead to some kind of childhood trauma that is hard to recover from. I worry that he’ll never understand why mommy had to go back to work. And I worry that I’ll lose all of my little free time and not be able to engage in any self care. These things are selfish, but anxiety so often is. And I don’t think that I’m wrong to worry about these things, I’m just ashamed of that. I want to make going back to work as easy as I can for both of them. It’s going to be a huge adjustment for all of us, and I’m scared of the magnitude of the change. That doesn’t mean that I don’t think it’s the right decision, I totally do, we’re broke, we need this. And it doesn’t mean that I don’t think that she should work, or that women should work or whatever. If her job or career was paying what mine was, this would be reversed. That’s just not the facts of our lives right now. And there is totally a part of me that would love to be able to afford to have her stay home with him, provided that’s what she wanted to do, for as long as she wanted to do that. I’d easily give up my job and take care of our son if her career was paying more. There is a part of me that wishes that was the case. That it would be easier for all of us to just reverse roles, and still have one of us take care of him, than to both work and put him in day care. And i know that he needs more socialization and to be with other kids. I just really hate separating them. I hate that there is part of him that just needs to “grow up” more and accept that life isn’t perfect. And it just feels like he’s too young for that. So, really, I’m just scared. I’m scared of change, and what that means. I’m scared of taking on more responsibility and I’m scared of failing. I’m scared that I won’t be able to support everyone and myself as well as I’d like to. I hate being scared. And I hate the fact that this fear and anxiety about the change that is coming just eats away at me. And I hate how hard it is to verbalize: Honey, I love you, and i want you to go back to work. And you’re amazing and kick ass and I 100% support you, and have your back. But I’m also scared about all of this change and how it will affect us and the boy. Maybe it’s ok to be scared and to have doubts. It’s possible that life is too complicated to just ease through. That things have to change for growth, and happiness. But, it’s still scary and I’m afraid that i won’t rise to the challenge. All that said, Khadijah is amazing and might have an incredible dream job soon. And I’m so proud of her, and she is my world. And I’m sorry that I’m not more sure of everything, but I’m not. It’s not in my nature to be.",2017
A Mind Turned Outwards,"My mind races. Unwanted thoughts creep in. My throat trembles. I feel like I can’t breathe. Those are the typical symptoms of my sporadic panic attacks. I suffer from severe anxiety. The psychiatrist says my particular condition is between panic disorder and obsessive compulsive disorder. Sometimes, I think my hair is falling out. Sometimes, I sweat uncontrollably from my armpits. Worst of all, sometimes I feel trapped inside my own head and can’t find a way out. Why do these things happen? I still do not really know. All I know is that I did not want to burden others with my problems. I always thought that I was strong enough to deal with my anxiety by myself. One weekend in October, I went home in hopes of finding peace and solace. I got away from the anxiety-inducing pace of the big city. But once home, my uneasiness only increased. My mind raced. My thoughts overwhelmed me. My brimming emotions finally poured out in the form of tears. I cried for hours buried in my mom’s arms. It took me until that weekend to finally admit my mental issues to my parents and seek professional help. I learned the hard way that the root of mental illness is a mind turned inwards. My anxiety is a trap that ensnares me into the deepest depths of my mind. Whether it is obsessing over my hair, preoccupying myself with my sweating armpits or experiencing a panic attack, I feel trapped in my own world. My anxiety stifles my attention to my work or the people around me. My anxiety buries my gratitude for all that is good in my life. My anxiety is a trap that ensnares me into the deepest depths of my mind. … I feel trapped in my own world. I believe the trick to any form of mental illness is to turn the mind outwards. In other words, to overcome anxiety or depression is to focus one’s attention and energy on something outside of oneself. It is to wake up and say, “today I get to do this,” or “today I get to see that person.” The trick to mental illness is move one’s thoughts beyond oneself — to rejoice in the existence of someone or something else. Obviously, this is infinitely much easier said than done. Even when I want to turn the mind outwards, it seems impossibly hard to do. I try calling the family members and friends I love most. I try reading my favorite books or editing videos. Sometimes this works, but most times I find myself unable to complete even these simple tasks. That is why I decided to seek professional help. That is why I started to take medication. I finally realized that the cure for my anxiety lay beyond myself. I finally realized that the only way to turn my mind outwards is to have other people help me do so. Sometimes we must admit that we cannot do it by ourselves. Sometimes we must admit that the cure is beyond our own power. Perhaps that is what a mind turned outwards is after all. This is a personal story by someone who asked to remain anonymous.

Bad Days,"Not all days are bad days but there’ve been a lot since Christmas. I’m angry at myself. Not for back-sliding or for being lax when I promised to maintain the things I learned in CBT, but for kidding myself into thinking that I ever looked OK. I don’t look OK, but why isn’t it acceptable to not look OK? Why am I making that my defining characteristic?! My inner monologue is a mean one and there’s rarely any reprieve. Alcohol dims it while the mirror magnifies it but there’s no avoiding either for now. The rational part of me wants to scream. I’m an intelligent woman, so why am I letting physical imperfections rule my life? I passed a trashy magazine earlier, emblazoned with Katie Price’s defiant “I’d rather be dead than have winkles” headline and while the sheer vanity-riddled absurdity of that sentence makes no sense to me, at the same time I feel the sentiment deeply. When my friends worry about their looks I want to grab them by the shoulders and shake them, and tell them that “at least you don’t look like me!” Today is all about the melodrama but maybe I’ll find a way through the fog tomorrow.",2017
Chrono-centrism,"You can end up feeling battered by the tide of history in your quest to meet your needs. It helps to know why your brain chemicals respond as they do to events in the world around you. Then it’s easy to understand your visceral sense of well-being or threat as you watch events unfold. (Find the full story in my new book, The Science of Positivity: Stop Negative Thought Patterns By Changing Your Brain Chemistry) Your brain releases dopamine when you expect a reward. It would be great to have that sense of excitement all the time, but the brain evolved to save its dopamine for opportunities to meet your needs instead of just releasing it all the time. Your brain defines opportunity with neural pathways created by the dopamine experiences of your past. Each brain promotes its survival by scanning the world for opportunity, and dopamine makes it feel good. Social rewards get your attention when basic needs are met, and avoiding harm is the highest reward to our survival-seeking brain. Of course, rewards are not perfectly predictable, so anticipated rewards do not always materialize. This is why you’re so eager for the next dopamine spurt, alerting you to the next potential reward. Neurons connect when dopamine flows, so each brain releases it in contexts that triggered it before. In the state of nature, survival depended on accurate predictions about where to find food, but in the modern world, you can fill your head with all kinds of predictions about future nirvanas and apocalypses. These responses feel especially reliable when you see they are shared by others, thanks to the brain chemical oxytocin. Oxytocin creates the good feeling of social trust. It would be nice to have that feeling all the time, but trusting everyone doesn’t promote survival. We have inherited a brain that rewards you with oxytocin when you find the safety of social support. We like to think of ourselves as independent individuals, but in the state of nature, an isolated mammal quickly lands in the jaws of a predator. Natural selection built a brain that makes you feel safe when you stick with the herd. As you distance yourself from the group, your oxytocin falls, and the bad feeling motivates you to return to the good feeling of safety in numbers. A mammal who refused to run until it saw the predator for itself would be eliminated from the gene pool. Our brain is inherited from individuals who trusted the alarm calls of their herd-mates. It’s easy to respond to public events with a shared sense of alarm because oxytocin makes it feel good. Neurons connect when oxytocin flows, so each brain seeks the comfort of oxytocin in ways that worked before. This is easy to see in others, but it’s hard to see in yourself because your chemicals turn on and off without notifying the verbal part of your brain in words. The limbic brain cannot process language, so it is not on speaking terms with your verbal cortex. This is why your verbal cortex struggles to explain the things you do for oxytocin. People have always looked at the world through a lens shaped by those around them, even as they strive to “think different.” This is easy to see in historical paintings, where each individual is dressed in the garb of their time period, even though each brain prides itself on its individual choices. Pride is a surge of serotonin, so let’s see how that chemical shapes our sense of being at the turning point in history. Serotonin gives you a good feeling when you connect yourself to the march of history. A sense of social importance helps an individual do what it takes to spread their genes, and natural selection built a brain that rewards you with a spurt of serotonin when you assert your social importance. [3] But that spurt is soon metabolized and you have to gain another social advantage to stimulate more. It’s easy to see why people are so motivated to find themselves a place on the stage of public affairs. Neurons connect when serotonin flows, so each brain seeks the good feeling of social importance in ways that stimulated it for them before. You may refuse to recognize your own urge for specialness, even if you’re quick to notice and condemn it in others. Each brain struggles to stimulate serotonin in ways that don’t risk its oxytocin and dopamine. Configuring public affairs in a way that makes you special is a non-violent, non-fattening way to do it. But that serotonin burst is soon processed and you have to do more to get more. When others seek it you may rail at their misguidedness, but when you seek it, you feel like you’re just trying to survive. It’s not easy being mammal! We humans have a sense of crisis because we’re aware of our own mortality. We know history will march on without us someday. Think about this future threat triggers cortisol, which creates an immediate visceral sense of threat. We try to mask that bad feeling by stimulating our happy chemicals, so it’s easy to see why we’re so eager for ways to stimulate them. You stimulate serotonin when you see your actions having an impact on the larger world. You stimulate oxytocin when feel yourself part of a larger movement. You stimulate dopamine when you anticipate rewards to your efforts. Each brain looks at the timeline of human history in reference to itself. It sees the past through the lens of what can meet its needs today. It sees the future through the lens of what stimulates happy chemicals today. This is why everyone who has ever lived has perceived themselves to be at the turning point in history. You may say “it’s different this time,” but it’s useful to notice how often people say that. For example, when you study another time in history, you end up concluding that it too was “a turning point.” You have power over your brain chemistry when you know where it comes from.

How to Deal with Anxiety As a Freelancer,"What if you don’t get the project? What if the client is disappointed in the work and you have to redo everything? What if you can’t pay your bills? What if harpies from Greek mythology show up at your house and steal your food? What if you end up destitute? All those “What Ifs” can kill your productivity. You waste your time and energy mind-tripping about what might go wrong instead maintaining ruthless focus on what you can control. Yes, anxiety is the enemy and antithesis of productivity, yet once that it has talons in your shoulder, it is hard to shake off. In order to thrive as a freelancer (as a human, really), you must learn how to deal with anxiety. You can sit there like a terrified kid watch the shadows of robbers, shadows, and boogeymen dance across the wall. Or you can choke down your anxiety, throw off the covers, and turn on the lights. Try this exercise: Allow yourself to think about the very worst thing that can happen. Mind-trip into your worst nightmare… You don’t get the project. Your business doesn’t receive that much-needed transfusion of cash. You overdraw your checking account. You must cannibalize your savings account to make up the difference. Without any savings, you’re now living paycheck to paycheck. You watch from the outside as other people enjoy the kind of success that you want. Another client disappointed with your work loses patience. She fires you. Your pride is hurt, and you are embarrassed. You are also angry that he didn’t acknowledge the part he played in micromanaging you, being very slow to make decisions, and constantly changing his plans. Your reputation as an artist and professional suffers. You lose your mojo. Freelancing dries up altogether. Desperate for cash, you take a job delivering pizzas. You can’t replace your income fast enough, and you’re late on several bills. You now have to pay penalties on top of what you originally owed. You lose your house. You declare bankruptcy. People you thought were friends keep their distance. You are broke and alone. All of this sounds terrible. None of these events will kill you, and most of them are unlikely to happen in the near future — if at all. You can and will survive. You have enough bravery to face the day. You have enough time and energy to accomplish the most important tasks. You have enough strength to endure. There’s dignity in delivering pizzas. So gather all of your bravery, slip out from underneath the covers, and look under the bed. Flip on the lights, and open the closet. Go there. Once you see it for what it is — a dirty t-shirt, not a true threat — you’ll know how to deal with anxiety. You can take a step back and remember that the vast majority of bad things never happen, and many, many good things that you never anticipated do. P.S. Did you learn anything?

5 Ways to Deal With on-The-Job Anxiety,"Anxiety disorder, one of the most common mental health issues affecting the American population, often goes unnoticed at the workplace. Though largely ignored, workplace anxiety is quite common and has now started taking a toll on people’s life. The condition not only severely affects employees’ emotional and physical health but also impacts their career by interfering with their productivity and performance. According to the Anxiety and Depression Association of America (ADAA), employees have admitted that stress and anxiety most often impact their workplace performance (56 percent), relationship with coworkers and peers (51 percent), quality of work (50 percent) and relationships with superiors (43 percent). Overall, a certain level of anxiety, preferably within a comfort zone, at the workplace is not always bad as it helps one in staying focused and improving performance. However, if stress triggered due to the pressure of meeting deadlines, interpersonal relationships, etc., begins to interfere with one’s personal life, it’s time to seek help or reflect. Nevertheless, there are some simple techniques that one can adopt to overcome on-the-job anxiety. A few of them are mentioned below: 1. Keep oneself busy: Generally, it is believed that the after office hours should be used to take rest. But, it is also important to make sure that one’s brain is not left idle and is engaged in some activity that keeps the work-related thoughts at bay. Spending time with friends and family, creating new memories or engaging in a hobby are few of the simple ways to make sure that work does not bother one at home. At the same time, it is important to ensure that work-related thoughts or problems at work do not make one sulk. 2. Exercise: Being a stress reliever, exercising before and after work hours can help one feel better and improve his or her mood. This can help in relaxing both the mind and body. Exercise releases endorphins, natural painkillers, in the body, which helps in improving mood and reducing discomfort. By burning the stress hormone cortisol, it helps in relieving the symptoms of anxiety. Further, exercising before work is supposed to be particularly beneficial in alleviating stress throughout the day. 3. Be creative: One of the best ways to turn mundane office tasks into something more interesting is by being creative. Besides one should ensure that he or she takes criticism positively. One can also try setting new challenges for oneself, such as completing work in less time and making his or work more exciting, engaging and fun. 4. Get enough sleep: Stress and anxiety can cause insomnia that can further disrupt emotional balance, which is essential for coping with any kind of stress. The inability to take proper rest also triggers anxiety. Therefore, it is important for an individual to ensure that he or she takes proper rest and does not engage in any kind of stressful activities closer to bedtime. Being away from the technology at least 45 minutes before bedtime can also help improve the quality of sleep. 5. Set realistic goals: It is possible that seniors at workplace may overload a person with work. Being a dedicated employee, he or she might desire to complete all the assigned tasks in one go and that too with perfection. This is quite an unrealistic goal. A person should always make sure that the goals set by him or her are realistic. He or she should also pat his or her back even on the smallest of accomplishments to stay positive. Above all, one should try and find humor in the smallest of situations to beat anxiety. Boost performance by curbing anxiety One should never let his or her job become a burden. It is important for every individual to enjoy his or her workplace. This can be accomplished by prioritizing tasks and breaking the entire project into smaller tasks. Eating healthy is another essential way to boost one’s performance. If you know someone who is dealing with an anxiety disorder, contact the Anxiety Treatment Advisors of Colorado.

Dispatch From a Sister March: An Anxious Guy Marches,"That led to step two of my plan. I needed to walk and it would be a pain to find parking nearby, so I drove down to Waterfront park and left my car there. I didn’t need to go that far to find parking, but it was a good walk and it made getting out of Salem at the end easier. I parked in an empty parking lot and headed toward the capitol. The rain and wind meant that there weren’t many people out in downtown Salem. As I got closer to the capitol building the sidewalk became more and more crowded. People with signs, people with their kids. I saw a little kid with his Mom and reflected on how different his life growing up must be to mine. My parents wouldn’t protest anything. They’re conservative Mormons so they don’t particularly care for Trump, but I wouldn’t be shocked if they voted for him. Then again, my Mom may have left the top of the ticket blank since we discussed her doing that. I got up to the capitol mall and there were a few hundred people when I got there. It was about twenty minutes before the scheduled start. I found a corner of the sidewalk that seemed far enough away from the crowd to smoke and lit up. I was sort of hiding behind a lamppost as much as you can hide behind a lamppost. It was cold as hell, but I was happy to be there, to be doing something. I chatted with a woman who came to smoke near me in what was now an unofficial smoking area. She said she moved from Seattle a few weeks ago and was happy with the turnout. We had the same fear, that no one would be there when we got there. I finished smoking and went to stand in the crowd. They were playing typical protest type music. Bob Marley and Bob Dylan, etc, before the speaking section of the event began. I snapped a couple photos of the people together with the capitol building in the background. It’s bad angle to fit a golden pioneer statue at the top of a building in with a crowd below it. I stood listening to the music and checking Twitter. I wasn’t the most active participant but my body was there and I figured that was something. Especially coming from someone as anxious as I am. About that time I started to regret not wearing my thermals. It was drizzling and cold as hell, the wind gusts brought occasional flurries of hard rain. Regretting my clothing decision became an obsession for the entire event. Around eleven they started, someone said something I don’t remember exactly. The entire speaking section was plagued with improper microphone technique. The microphones worked the entire time, but people jostled around and went up and down in volume. It make it hard to hear them in the back or even in the middle. Oregon Governor Kate Brown spoke first. She had the best microphone technique of the whole event and was the most capable speaker. Then a couple other people I forget spoke, the basic premise being unity and love over hate. I don’t mean to diminish what they said, but it slipped straight through my mind. It was hard to concentrate and to hear them. About halfway through the speakers I slipped to the side to smoke another cigarette. I was starting to feel a little boxed in. I initially stood in the back, but as I left to smoke I realized I was actually in the middle of the crowd. And more people were still pouring in. I smoked and walked to the new back of the crowd. I stood like I had for most of the event. Shivering, with my hands stuck in my pockets and my mouth feeling glued shut from the anxiety of it all. I kept reminding myself that I was there at least and that was something. They tried to rally the crowd into chants, but it was a pretty unenthusiastic crowd. The people running it weren’t all that good at starting chants either, so the crowd was flat. People were milling about, running into people they knew, and taking pictures of signs. It was a good time despite the cold and rain. The actual march section of the event held more enthusiasm. Around noon we started moving. The march consisted of going west about four blocks then around one and straight back up. It did bring out more noise from the crowd though, so it was enjoyable. Plus I’m sure moving instead of shivering kept my body a little warmer. By the time we started marching I had been out in the rain for an hour and a half. My jacket soaked through and the sweatshirt I had on underneath was getting damp. The worst was my feet. My shoes and socks soaked through from standing in the muddy grass. I felt my feet starting to go numb. My shoulders were stiff and sore. I wasn’t miserable though, but a little uncomfortable. The march was nice, we walked down the street and cheered, whooped, and chanted. Other people did, my anxious mouth still wasn’t moving. Earlier I did have a short chat with a guy about the interstate popular vote compact. Besides that chat and the one with the woman when I got there I didn’t say a word the entire time. I took an undue amount of joy in walking in the middle of the street through red lights. While we were marching you could see how big the crowd had become. I guessed a thousand and a bit. People are terrible at estimating crowd sizes, but the police estimated a couple thousand. I felt two things while marching. I felt like I wasn’t alone in the anger and upset which was a nice feeling to have. It was healing in a sense. The second was that the march wasn’t doing much for anyone in Salem. We completely avoided the downtown area where people might see the march. The weather meant everyone was inside anyway. The only people who saw the march were the people marching. I suppose we contributed to the global number. I’m sure some people read about it in the paper, so it might be meaningful. Still, it felt rather masturbatory. I’m glad I went though. We got back to the capitol mall and people started dispersing back to their cars or lingering around. I was wet, cold, and figured I needed to be home soon to be there when the guy I care for got back so I headed home. As I crossed the street from the capitol mall there was a young guy standing in a Make America Great Again hat. His hood covered it, but he looked sort of creepy being the only one there. I’d say mass shooting creepy, but it was more pathetic than that. I don’t know if he expected a counter protest to occur or wanted to revel in pissed off liberals, but it was weird. I figure if our protest did nothing else we at least made one asshole stand in the cold rain for two hours. And that’s something.",2017
On pins and needles: How I discovered the world of panic disorder.,"(Disclaimer note: English is not my native language, feel free to point out mistakes; this post also happens to be a revision of something I wrote few months ago in personal diary) I thought I never feared anything. Not consciously, at least; so when my doctor told me that I had a panic disorder, I could not believe it at first. “You have a panic disorder,” she stated matter-of-factly. And although I did inherit my dramatic flair from parents, I can not say that her words rang in my ears as a death sentence. Moreover, I glanced back skeptically and said “Orly?” (I can remember it clearly). …When I had a panic attack next time, I took my bravadoing words back. In my defense, I can say that my sheer disbelief had several reasons for it. I felt incredulous of such a serious diagnosis because my first panic attack (akin the first kiss, but more like a punch in face) happened when I was under a great pressure. Academic struggles, student elections, sick relationship, and many other things piling up and looming over my sanity. I was pale, I was clearly sick, I nosebled and cried at nights. So when I woke up from yet another nightmare, breathless and paralyzed, sweating, almost blind and with the taste of blood on my bitten, cracked lips, I thought it was normal. Hell, it was not. It kept on coming and going. Usually during nights, with nightmares and muffled screams. I used to wake up trembling; I saw shadows in my dark, curtained room, I heard distant voices. It felt unreal, utterly illogical and painful. I was weak, ashamed and shameful; I wept and clung onto my blanket, and my whole body refused to move in a fit of sleep paralysis. In a couple of minutes it would fade, and after a few deep tortured breaths I would sink into delirious sleep for the rest of the night. The morning after I would be completely fine and write it off on my nightmares. By the time I finally managed to see a doctor, the last attack I had was several weeks before. I thought I was done. I lived in a denial and was amusedly waiting for the consequences of my brave stupidity and ignorance. Perhaps, it was a complete opposite — a fearsome denial. As any other person I was afraid of being labeled — I’ve already had an experience of being alienated. Although my introversive nature somehow allows me to function well enough during social gatherings, I am direly afraid of being stigmatized. I did not want is to hear “Ah, so you’re one of those…”. One of those who? One of those ‘silly girls and boys, thinking that if they pick a disease in Wiki and start mimicking its symptoms then they will get more attention’? Or one of those ‘unfortunate human beings who indeed have a mental disease but people do not recognize it as an actual disease’?.. Probably this is the thing I fear the most — to be misunderstood. So I huffed and cringed at the cruel words ‘you have a panic disorder’. I narrowly escaped thepolite introduction, saying that I have nothing to do with this. What changed my mind? What brought me to acceptance? Well, several things at once. Chaotically spasming lungs which did not allow even to rasp onto the air. Blurring, decolouring world that sharply shrunk down to a tunnel of light, which disappeared as well. I could not breathe again, I could not move, and I could swear that my heart was about to burst yet another time. The difference was that it happened in the middle of a street, and I was falling down. I did not see it, but I felt my body crane. I remember how I subconsciously registered that fact and thought ‘Well, I’m gonna break something’. Stupid, taking in consideration that my whole system was simply shutting down. So, my first greatest fear I mentioned in this post was a fear of misunderstanding. Second was, and forever is, a fear of not being able to control myself. In this turbulent world where conditions change all the time and it’s sometimes practically impossible to adjust, I’ve always relied on my ability to get a grip on myself and deal with any challenge I faced. So when I found myself immobilized, vulnerable and practically disabled (even if for a brief moment)… I would rather break my arm again, but be capable of processing reality, rather than submit to the whirlwind of confusion that warmly embraced me. I was fortunate enough to ‘reboot’ mid-fall and grab onto the railing. It was late evening, the street was empty, and so no one saw my misery and no one was there to eye me with pity. It was a lesson hard enough for me to understand that my condition is not something that I can try ignoring and forgetting. Sooner or later it would strike back and it will be even worse. …It’s been a while since that unfortunate occasion. I still have bad dreams sometimes; and I wake up, scared and breathless. It’s not something that can magically disappear in a day or two. But I’ve learned to live with it. It is not an acute disease which I’d have to battle and struggle against, like cancer or AIDS; it is a ghost that will always follow me and sink its ice-cold fingers in my throbbing heart. But if you learn to recognize it and face it — maybe it will think twice before trying its dirty tricks on you in the broad daylight. My point is: Don’t be afraid of accepting your fears and conditions. Get to know them. Say hi and learn their weaknesses. You can’t defeat something by simply ignoring it.",2017
My Third Trip by Air was…interesting,"So, I am settled into my hotel for the night. It will be my home away from home for 25 days before, hopefully, work project completion. Getting here was, as my title said…interesting. Why? Well we left San Antonio in the clear and flew into stormy. That means turbulence. For all you flyers out there, you know that turbulence is no fun! The greater the turbulence, the worse imagination can run away from you. Me? My imagination actually did pretty well! Why? Well, my mind shut down as soon as I hit a certain level of stress. I was clicking away on my fidget toy like crazy. I once again had a co-worker, a different one this time, helping me through the challenges. I am really determined to beat this fear and experience the ability to go anywhere I want by plane. My niece graduates in May, and I want to fly to the graduation because otherwise I would have to allocate four days for travel to and from just to go. I don’t want to use up all my vacation time just because I am too scared to board the plane. Take off seems to be the hardest for me. Right now I am trying to figure out, does it really make me dizzy, or is my stress making me dizzy and I just need to battle the emotions and let go of the stress so that take off isn’t a problem anymore. I have broken down various stress points to date and stripped away the fearful thoughts to see the truth. As I do that, I have been able to overcome a whole bunch of fears regarding flying. What have I overcome so far? I am sure there are other misconceptions I have had, that have also proved false. I am stripping away the lying fears that have kept holding me back from experiencing life joyfully. The trip was rough. We had quite a bit of turbulence coming into San Diego because that storm I left with? Its still around. I felt like I was on a raft going down a wild river with all the shimmy and shake. Its not a bad example either. Air is after all a fluid, and when a plane flies, it is riding air currents that are a high in the sky river of its own. Turbulence is not unusual when flying, though by no means does every plane ride have it. So I started and stopped this plane ride stressed. I have two more areas of fear that I need to process, and work through in order to battle it out and hopefully win against my mental and emotional foe. I am not giving up. I know for sure I have one plane ride ahead of me, and its a month away. You won’t hear from me for a while about this, but know that when it’s time to finally fly home, I am hoping to have overcome this and to be able to fly with excitement!",2017
3 Reasons Why You’re Not Over Your Ex,"I have had several of my Readers reach out and ask for my advice on this topic.  I decided to write about it knowing how intense and sensitive of a topic it is for so many of us.  But the only way I can provide advice is to be honest in what I’m about to share.  So let’s start here:  One thought you often have: “We’ve been through a lot together and I have felt so much pain and disappointment, but I don’t know how it’s possible for me to get over someone that I have loved so deeply. I just don’t know how to”.  Translation: I have invested so much time and energy into this relationship, at least I know this person — the good and the bad and they always made me feel loved. I know I am not ready yet to put myself out there again.  Do you see what you’re convincing yourself of?  The first raw question you need to ask yourself is: Why are you REALLY still holding on?  Be honest with yourself.  What part of you do you feel they still complete?  Is this part half full or half empty?  That’s the most important question.  We too often fill a void with someone else’s attention and/or affection without first trying to complete it ourselves first. By looking within.  Because it’s too scary.  Because it’ll take too much work.  It’s difficult to admit that you’re also accountable for what you feel and the hurt you have felt.  But it’s the truth.  So stop being the victim and start standing your ground. It will be very difficult, at first. It will feel gut-wrenching.  That’s how you know it’s real.  But I promise you that it gets easier, a lot quicker than you think.  Someone that respects you, also respects your values, your time, your love and your will power.  Someone that actually loves you and respects you — is able to walk away, instead of choosing to persist.  Someone that loves you and respects you, allows you to choose them.  *  In Summary, why are you not over your ex? If you can relate to at least one of these, then let me know.  1. You don’t want to be over your ex.  It’s the hard truth. You know it is best for you to move on but you keep going back, every time. You have allowed your ex to live in their thoughts, fears and dreams. In other words, your Heart. So what is it that they are giving you that you are not giving yourself?  2. You want to believe they are still the person you fell in love with.  The love you feel is the love you want to feel. Accepting that this person you committed to isn’t who you always thought they were, is a stab at your confidence and your ability to make decisions in love.  So hoping that they are who you want to believe they are, is only an approach you are using to avoid further pain and disappointment. It’s also causing you a lot more than that because it’s not letting you move forward. It’s keeping you stuck.  3. You are scared of making the same mistake again.  Choosing to stay within your comfort zone is so much easier. And meeting anyone else feels daunting. The secret: It will feel daunting until you realize that you need to deserve yourself first.  *  Your story is your story. It’s not my story or anyone else’s story. So it will always be different.  But all I ask is that you reflect on what you may be disagreeing with me on and ask yourself whether it’s another excuse that’s preventing you from moving forward.

Laundry Day,"Laundry day. Dishes first, right after I pack away the groceries. 29 minute wash cycle means means just enough time to do both. 59 minute dry cycle gives me just enough time to read a few pages from Girl On The Train. This is Wednesday, or Tuesday, never Saturday or Sunday. I’m not sure if the day actually makes a difference. As long as I go when the least amount of people are loading the machines. My good clothes get hung to dry over bedroom doors. My dry clothes flung on the mattress. This is meant to inspire me to fold them and put them away before bed. I spend the next two days sleeping on the couch. The same couch no one is allowed to lay down on. On my balcony for some fresh air. I wish I smoked cigarettes. An excuse to bare the cold so I could stare over Parkdale homes and apartment buildings that much longer. I forgot to wash the towels. Only one left in the linen closet. That decision is already made. Laundry day. The mundane could be dangerous. The mind wanders, actions soon follow. Follow me on Medium Kern Carter More pieces like this on C.R.Y.",2017
Can we talk about … Anxiety?,"I started suffering with anxiety and panic attacks 4 years ago. I can still remember the first time, as if it was yesterday. I was walking down an empty road near my home, and suddently I had the innate sense that someone was following me. Shortly after, the paranoia set in, I felt as though someone was out to get me. My heart started beating really fast, my brain went fuzzy, and I felt as though, I couldn’t get a breath of fresh air into my lungs. I had never had this sensation before, so to say I was terrified would be an understatement. It lasted not longer than 15 minutes, but it scared me straight. Since then I have suffered with panic attacks on and off. It’s hard to explain how you feel when you’re in the grips of an attack. You try and keep calm, but everything starts racing, your mind, your heart, and everything else around you. Recently I remembered a tip a female friend (motivational speaker) had given me for anxiety, she told me to repeat the words “I am calm, I am calm” and breath. I never really bought into the whole self help motivational/inspirational chanting thing ( although I do enjoy listening to Tim Robbins from time to time). I had a panic attack two days ago, for the first time in a long time. You never know when it’s going to happen, and when it does, people don’t understand. I sat down on a bench, gathering my thoughts, my heart was racing like crazy. I just wanted everything to slow down. I couldn’t concentrate on anything and even breathing became a chore. Those words “ I am calm” popped into my head, so quietly, to myself (everyone staring at me like I’m some crazy cat lady) I repeated the words, while breathing in between sentences. Eventually after the 4th time repeating them, I actually started to feel calmer and more in control. I was in shock, how could such a simple ritual, help in such a big way. I felt at ease, tranquil. It seems to me, that a lot of people find it hard to open up about anxiety. I think they feel that, if they open up about it, it might affect their career, relationships and more. It is so important for people to use their voice and talk about it, no one should feel stigmatised. Everyone is so busy all of the time, and no one takes time for themselves anymore. We are so consumed by technology, fast food and working til our hands drop off, that it is having serious affects on our mental health. Our generation (Generation y) are suffering from an increase in panic attacks and anxiety, and considering our obsession with social media and the constant need to appear perfect, it’s hardly surprising. “Man is not worried by real problems so much as by his imagined anxieties about real problems” ― Epictetus Everyone is different, but these are some of the things that have helped me on my journey with anxiety. > Calming music (anything by Brian Eno usually does the trick) whack up the volume and sit back and relax > Repeat after me (“I am calm, I am calm”) eventually you will trick your mind into thinking that you are indeed calm, this one has really worked for me. > Start a project/ do some research on anxiety ( I am in the middle of completing my Degree af the moment, and I have found it very therapeautic to base my Digital project around anxiety, I am creating a prototype for an anxiety app, aimed at supporting people with anxiety. I am passionate about this subject and I find that researching the topic, helps my own stress levels. Understanding yourself is key. > Keep a diary ( if you start feeling anxious, start taking notes, write down how you feel?, where you are?, is there anything significant happening around you?) > Reduce your caffeine and chocolate intake and start to look at your diet ( I noticed early on, that I am more prone to anxiety and panic attacks after, I have had my morning fix of coffee, with like ten million shots. Caffeine, Alcohol and sugary treats can trigger anxiety, so it’s always important to review your diet and make sure your eating the right things). > Meditation ( meditating is a great way of keeping anxiety at bay, wow that rhythms! There are some great meditation apps out there, one I use myself is Headspace. There level one course features 10 minute sessions for each day that will help you get into the habit of meditating. I would also give ‘Calm’ and ‘Mindbody Connect’ a try. Meditation is one of the ebst ways to combat stress, which is one of the triggers for anxiety. > Make exercise part of your daily life ( I find that exercise really reduces my attacks, and keeps me generally healthy. Exercise is known to release endorphins, endorphins also trigger a positive feeling in the body, similar to that of Morphine (not condoning the real thing) > learn what your triggers are ( Everyone has different triggers, learn to listen to your body, do you have panic attacks when your around too many people?, when your too warm?, when your stressed?, when you drink?. listen to your body. You will find the answers). > Talk to someone you trust (talk to a partner, a loved one, a sibling, I guarantee they will listen with open ears). If all else fails, and you have tried everything above, it may be time to seek help from a Therapist. They may be able to prescribe medication to help ease the anxiety, like SSRI’s, or certain anti-depressants. These are just a few of the ways, I have learned to deal with my stress and anxiety, everyone is different. I guess the main thing I have learned from having these attacks, is to slow down. I’m always on the go, always onto the next task. Sometimes it’s important to stop and smell the roses. Everyone deserves some headspace, everyone deserves to breath, everyone deserves to switch off. If you don’t take time for yourself, you will burn out and you will get stressed, it will in turn reek havic on your health. Start taking care of yourself and live everyday healthily, life is not a race, it is a journey.",2017
Anxiety,"Tiny grains of sand Do not know The ocean they roll within And I do not know The black space In which I rotate and spin He does not know The ideas he occupies The facade the world hides behind The obvious intentions Blooming and drying And I could lay out the cards With my words, I could turn But nature and I We made a deal Good things grow slowly And some wounds take too long to heal Moving a mountain Swimming upstream For love I would bury myself deep And break open stone And let it bleed But I can’t compete Not with old scars And there is no win, no “beat”. I’ve lived longer than my 23 years But understand less Every day Like how two hearts can want the same thing But neither move And fade in the fray",2017
Anxiety,"I’m still new here and don’t know what to write, so I’m just going to talk about my experiences with anxiety. Maybe it’ll help someone, somewhere.

Like the time I tried to put together my Magic Rocks set by myself. I was around 8 and was bored one night, so I ripped open the box and started setting it up. The corner of my eye tickled, so I scratched it. It felt like something was in it after that and I was getting annoyed. I tried to ignore it and started reading the directions (after I’d opened and touched literally everything there was to touch). Then it happened… I saw in big letters: AVOID CONTACT WITH EYES. Everything went downhill from there. I panicked. First of all, that warning was in big letters.. so it must be really important and deadly. Secondly, I clearly shoved the chemicals in my eye which is why I felt like there was a cow walking on it. Third, I was going to die, because of Magic Rocks in my eye. That would be the most ridiculous and embarrassing death ever. I suddenly couldn’t breathe and did exactly what I’d do every time I used to panic then, stand up, letting everything on my lap fall to the floor, drop all items I’m holding and open my eyes wide and stand there deciding if i should cry, go tell my mom the whole situation or, in this case, try to wash my eyes out. I did all three. The problem was, it wasn’t my mom that was home. It was her fiance, and he wasn’t one for feeling sympathetic or understanding pretty much anything about a child, and he loved to tease me in a weird older brother type of way. So I had to wait until my mom got home to tell her about it. I’m not sure how long that took, or when my breathing returned to normal, but I know it did. After that I’d feel like I couldn’t breathe every time I got stressed. It took until I was 12 years old, during a Freddy Kreugar movie, to actually fully explain it to anyone, get taken to the hospital, and get diagnosed with anxiety. That’s a whole other story though. Because I was so young, I literally went around thinking that things like Magic Rocks could not only make you blind, die, but also make you have problems breathing. I’m not sure how many things I thought could make you feel like you couldn’t breathe, but either way I know it was a very pathetically large amount… I think I’m going to end it here for now. But to all the parents out there, despite what most people think, anxiety can show up at any age, and it’s best to get it diagnosed as soon as possible so you and your child can learn about it and you can help your child to recognize when they’re having an anxiety/panic attack. Every time they feel like their heart is racing, they can’t breathe, or feel wobbly and dizzy you can reassure your child that everything is going to be okay, and most importantly, that they aren’t seriously ill or dying. Because I can promise you, it definitely crosses your mind when you’re having one. If anyone reads this and needs or wants someone to talk to about anxiety, I’m here.",2017
Embrace Boredom,"By constantly tethering ourselves to technology, we are killing the calm and stillness in our lives. And that calm that used to be such a constant companion is soon overtaken by the anxiety. Anxious about needing to find the next stimuli. Anxious that something new is happening that we will miss out on. Anxious about being bored. Was it always this way? Have we always been plagued by this constant buzz of busyness? Have we always been followed around by a constant urge to stay entertained? Maybe the boredom we sought to replace was keeping the calm in our lives. Maybe the space in between the moments was meant to stay as space. Protected and undisturbed. Those precious quiet moments in between the busy. I miss the calm. I miss the stillness. I miss being so bored that we forced ourselves to get creative with our time. In an attempt to bring the calmness back, we must embrace boredom. It’s the moments in between the busy that keep us calm. In the new age, we have come to call these moments boredom. And so often, we bastardize these moments of boredom with the constant interruption of a cell phone check or email scan. No more. I am bringing boredom back. And the calm and stillness that has been so fleeting as of late will be a missed companion from the past. Onward to my 30's. Check out more at www.johnhamilton.blog",2017
Untitled Two and Three (2015),"It’s 3 a.m. , I’m watching Sons of Anarchy, and I still haven’t taken a shower yet. I leave for college in six days, but I can’t really say that I’m ready. I’m kind of sad that I haven’t drawn in a few days, but I’ll get back at it tomorrow. I haven’t finished my second book yet, but I think I’m making good progress. My songwriting/poetic talent is increasing, so that’s always good. I think I’ve got a good concept going for the second book. I’ve thought about the things that went wrong with my first book, and I hopefully can correct them my the second book. It’s a weird feeling when you hit the bottom. In the moment it’s hard to tell that you’ve hit the bottom. Most of the time you don’t even feel it. It’s usually onlywhen you’re looking back on your life that you realize when you hit your lowest point. Hitting the bottom isn’t necessarily a bad thing. Just make sure you do something while you’re down there. Make the most of your time at the bottom. It’ll be worth it when you resurface.",2017
Untitled One (2015),"It’s hard to believe that I’m starting to fall in love with the night. Although I feel more sad during the nighttime hours, there’s still something strangely appealing about the night. As the summer progressed, I gradually began staying up later. The night doesn’t seem as long anymore. The darkness doesn’t seem as dark anymore. I wonder how long it will be before I start resent the night for feeling like nothing more than “daytime part two.” When I peek through my window at 3 a.m. to gaze at the sky, I no longer see black. I see a very dark shade of blue. Nocturnal Blue. I’m not sure if that’s a real color, but I hope that it is. We have a screen door in my kitchen that leads into my backyard, and my dog accidentally ripped it open. He takes advantage of that hole by using it to go outside as he pleases. Well, that is when leave the screen door exposed by opening the glass door. Theres a good chance that my description of the door didn’t make any sense, but whatever. It’s weird because I don’t like my dog having that much independence. If he was a normal dog, I wouldn’t mind, but my dog can find trouble effortlessly. It’s weird how my dog is fearless when it comes to fighting other animals and exploring, but he’s a total baby when it comes to thunderstorms. It just shows that no matter how tough you appear to be, you’re always scared of something. It’s 1:50 in the morning.",2017
What depression feels like when it doesn’t happen to you,"Depression, anxiety, self-medication — these are things I know well. The conditions are not mine, but they are ever-present in my life. Whether you’re a child, a partner, a sibling, a parent, or a friend of someone struggling to cope with a mental illness, your life can be as upside down as theirs. At times, I’d argue it can feel worse. When someone close to you is suffering, you feel it twice. The first time is through empathy. This is sometimes preceded by confusion, research, and diagnosis, if you were involved in that process. Your heart breaks for the person you love because you don’t want them to suffer. You try to be there, check in, dip your toes into the darkness as much as you can, or as much as they’ll allow. You read books, share links to helpful articles. You try to keep the household a calm space. You have a good talk, you help them pick up their prescriptions, you Google side-effects. You’re relieved you have an answer. You grab their hand, ready to take on this disease together. It hasn’t really hit you yet, I promise. The second time you feel it is the last time you’ll feel it, and here’s the thing you’re not supposed to say and certainly no one wants to hear. It lasts forever. Some days you feel it like an itch or a paper cut, and other days it’s more like the weight of a truck pinned firmly against your chest. A weight that lays you on the cold bathroom tile at four in the morning because it’s the only time you can cry and scream into a towel without upsetting anyone. That’s what no one tells you when you’re playing the supportive role. The doctor never turns to you and says, “Buckle up, because this is going to be extraordinarily hard for you too.” What is that weight exactly? It creeps up on you from a manageable place. You decide it’s not that big of a deal that they regularly fall asleep at 8pm. You tell yourself they don’t mean the awful things they say to you in fits of anger because they always apologize later. You make excuses for them when they break plans and promises. After all, they’re the ones struggling. You say to yourself, this is the least you can do. This isn’t about you. But it is about you. It has to be, or you’re not helping anyone. And those manageable issues can turn into an ugly manipulation if not kept in check. Novice mental illness patient plus novice support system can equal a legitimate nightmare. Neither party knows what they’re doing. The patient cautiously tries to find a combination of treatments that work through trial and error. Sometimes they get frustrated and see how much they can get away with, because it can be easier to self-medicate and give into depression than to fight it. The supporter fumbles to navigate setting much-needed boundaries because this new world is full of different rules they don’t yet understand. And oh, the guilt you encounter when sticking to those boundaries. It’s a puzzle with no corner pieces to guide you. It’s a high-stakes, no harness tightrope walk you think you’ll never complete. And you’re so alone. Unlike other medical conditions, mental illness isn’t an issue many people feel comfortable rallying around (yet). Resources, especially for those without solid benefits? Limited. Shame, hurt, and fear? Unlimited. Sometimes, in instances of self-medication, you uncover lies. You bear witness to hard falls from sobriety. The once solid parts of your relationship begin to deteriorate and are made worse by the smaller daily blows that can easily knock the wind out of you without a moment’s notice. There’s gaslighting. When things don’t add up, you’re told that you’re crazy for putting the pieces together. And what’s worse, you start to believe it. (Pro tip: where there’s smoke, there’s usually fire. Never under any circumstances lose the telephone line from your gut to your brain. The heart will try to snip the cord. You can’t allow it.) If you get to that place, the disease becomes all-consuming. You are frozen in place, stung by pain and worry with no clear direction home. In the worst of times, I felt like I was free falling every day from the point I left them in the morning until I returned from the work day and they were home, if they came home. It wasn’t always pleasant, but it was one less uncertainty I had to endure after checking the car mileage, card transactions, and the house for evidence of lies. Whether you’re bound to this person by marriage, familial ties, or friendship, it’s a desperate place to be. And it doesn’t matter which aspect of the situation is upsetting you the most. You will hit a breaking point, and it will collapse you. But after it collapses you, it can liberate you. It took me years to get here. I’m fairly certain I did everything wrong along the way. I sometimes made things harder than they should have been. I was selfish when I didn’t have to be. I felt bad for myself for a long time, and I carried a sick anger for much longer. The situation broke me, but then I made a choice. Through therapy, I learned I couldn’t control another human’s behaviour. It’s a simple notion — a fact, really. But when you’re in the thick fog, it’s the furthest fact from your sightlines. I could only control me. I had to find a way to let go. I knew I couldn’t do it alone, so I enrolled in fitness classes, online courses, and made commitments I couldn’t break that would force me to focus my attention — and sometimes my body itself — away from problems at home. All those healthy interactions, though uncomfortable at first, began to feel good in their distracting glory. In pouring myself into positive activities, I found a way to remember who I am, what I enjoy, and what I can do. I could be happy — a thought that hadn’t occurred to me in months. Then, a wonderful, confusing thing happened. The more I made myself happy, the less patience I had for the things that didn’t. Conversations and behaviours I didn’t agree with at home were immediately, and politely, shut down. I couldn’t be shook because I stopped taking responsibility for anything that wasn’t of my direct doing. I stopped being a punching bag the minute I started hitting a real one. I found sure footing in my boundaries, the guilt subsided, and I liked the person looking back at me in the mirror. (This sounds so breezy, I assure you this process wasn’t.) I loved them, but was unwilling to continue fighting if they were going to sit on the sidelines. I meant it. And several times, I exercised that truth. I remember walking myself home from a party after being lied to. Old me would have stayed, choking back tears, because I was too afraid of what would happen to them if I left. New me stood my ground, walked out the door, and cried big, full beads that froze to my face the whole way home. I couldn’t tell if they were tears of sadness or pride, probably both. If they didn’t get home that night, it wouldn’t have been my fault. And I slept alone that night, but I slept soundly. Day after day, I did more of the same. I slowly noticed them coming home when they said they’d be there. They began answering their phone and replying to texts within reasonable timeframes. They asked if I’d join them on a walk and held my hand. They rolled over one morning and hugged me without prompting and it felt as though I was weightless. They had returned to me slowly in these microscopic but massive strides. They still falter, but it finally feels like we’re a team. It’s not always easy, but it’s a lot less hard today than it was last week, and the week before that — for them, and for me. We go full days now without feeling any darkness in the room. Each day without shadows is a victory we celebrate. Once I saw it could still be what I hoped it would, I made the choice to stay. I’m so glad now that I hung on, though looking back I’m unsure how I made it through to the other side. I’m proud of him, proud of me, proud of us. I sometimes still have my doubts. Nothing is for certain — least of all in life with mental illness. But if they are willing to wake up every day to find their way out of a forest with no trails, then I am willing to build a compass and a flashlight. And when we find each other amongst the trees, the sky always opens up and the stars light our way home.",2017
Let’s Talk Again,"This day holds a special place in my heart. It’s been 3 years since the world as I knew it was shaken to the core and, although I didn’t know it at the time, my day to day would change for the foreseeable future. Long story short I had a panic attack at a family supper, an event which should be filled with joy and laughter as usual, but was filled with a very different version of Braedon. No jokes. Not much talking. Just eating and counting down the minutes until I could escape. Now, after some self reflection I realize I was always an anxious kid and a “worry wart”, but it had never manifested itself in such a way. I called in sick to work the next morning, the panic attack lasted 17 hours, and ended up losing my job as a result of my choice to pull back on the responsibilities of a new role and take care of myself instead. If you know anything about me, you know that I’m not one to take shit and standing up for myself and my health and well being in that moment is still one of my proudest moments in recent memory. Since that day, the anxiety and panic attacks seemed to be more noticeable, rearing their ugly heads through a consistent sinking feeling in my stomache, just going about the motions, and disaster scenarios filled with movie-quality visualizations of my own death or loss of a job or relationship. Seriously, every time I go on a road trip I just imagine the bus or the car getting T-boned by a semi or just randomly veering off into the ditch while executing a perfect triple pike twist that would make any gymnast hold up a 10. To address the thought that is often on the minds of people who don’t fully understand what it’s like to battle a mental illness; no, I’ve never wanted to kill myself. That doesn’t mean I’m stronger than anyone else, my disease is just a little bit different. That also doesn’t mean that I’m not scared as shit that someday it might get so bad that I would consider that as an option — but I’ve just chalked that up to another disaster scenario because I’m literally petrified of death and I don’t see that changing anytime soon. But I digress. I learned how to deal with it. I am “high-functioning” as they like to call it. I still crushed out classes, a job, a VP role on the Hill BSS, volunteering, JDC West, and maintained a very admirable social life. It wasn’t always easy, but keeping myself busy seemed to help. I learned to deal with an “episode” (not the fun Netflix kind) and be able to function as expected wherever I was. If it got too bad, I’d remove myself from the situation or just be honest with those around me that I was having a bit of anxiety. That usually helped to calm me as I didn’t feel like I had to act “normal” and could just be myself in that moment. Side note: I discovered improv not too long after my struggles with mental illness started and to say it’s changed my life is an understatement. One of my favourite things to do in life is to make people laugh and I get to do that all the time now. It is a night of the week that I get to truly look forward to when I’m feeling down. Not to mention how supportive and amazing every single member of Hitchhikers is. I’ve never felt more cared about in my life. So to each and every one of you; thank you. This fall something seemed to change though. It became really hard to get out of bed. Like REALLY fucking hard. I’d push meetings back. I’d cancel plans. I’d show up to work later than usual only to leave 2 hours later to go back to sleep, the only part of my day where my thoughts would calm. I once tried to explain that I was really, really struggling with my mental health and was given a lecture that started off with “I’ve never dealt with mental illness but…” Here’s a pro tip: if you’ve never dealt with mental illness, giving advice about the way you live is undoubtedly the last fucking thing you should be doing. Listening and understanding are the first. So, time continued to roll on and I felt very down and melancholic, where things I used to enjoy just didn’t seem to do it for me anymore. This is when I realized that something really needed to change or things were going to get bad. I decided I would drop out of some things and change work places so that I could focus on my own health for a short-time before hitting the ground running again. Fast forward through another bad but more hopeful week. On one particularly shitty day I found out I had to drop out of the next semester due to a student loan mixup. I thought all was lost. Then I realized that it might actually be a very, very good thing to take a break and truly focus on me for a change. It was truly a blessing in disguise. Making sure I am where I need to be physically, financially, and most importantly mentally, to continue to function as highly as I know I can. Fast forward to now and I’ve never been more content. I get to focus on catching up on life and friends, working, and improv. This has gone on far longer than I expected it to, so if you’ve read this far bless your heart. I hope it doesn’t feel preachy or angry or elitist. I only intend to share what I’ve dealt with, deal with, and what I’ve done to help it, praying that one person finds a bit of themselves in the writing and is able to better their mental health even by the smallest of margins.",2017
My First Panic Attack,"Blood and guts pouring from my mouth, torn apart with fear. Unable to digest the world around me, unable to digest the alcoholism I grew up around, the pot smoking, the endless sex behind Brooklyn doors, the endless torture, the moving from one flophouse to another, running down Connecticut hills screaming for mercy, being told to not talk back, being told to roll with it… But I’m 5…But I’m 6…But I’m 7…never mind, I’ll just turn off… I get on a plane with a girlfriend. I’m not sure about this plane ride. Something queasy was growing in my stomach about a week before the plane trip to Montana to visit her father, the peach farmer. I was so excited to go, to see a new land, to breathe some different air, to meet the man that made this creature I loved so dearly. But, again, this weird bug, this bug that was now creeping up into my skull. This bug that was kind of dislocating my eyes from my brain. The bug that began to not be able to handle anything, to digest all the traffic lights, the different noises of horns and voices and espresso machines and music. I don’t remember approaching the airport at all. My brain was seemingly lifted out of my skull, a veritable losing of the mind. I now, quite fully, knew what that expression meant, and if you’ve never felt it, I suggest you don’t, or do, because it will, either make you or break you, and, in the end, I feel, that’s the question we’re all trying to have answered, “Do I have what it takes?” or “Can I hack it?” I’ve got the aisle seat. It’s a cheap airline. Drifter Air or something. I started to think so many questions, my brain was some little Vietnamese island ripped apart by unexpected B-52s… “What does Drifter Air mean?” “Wow, look at my girlfriend, how did she get that kind of crimson color at the tips of her hair?” “Ah, and that guy, look at his gut, spilling onto the shoulders of that poor old lady as he tucks his gigantic briefcase into the luggage compartment. How old was that lady? And that man with the gut! What a life! He’s stuck on Drifter Air forever…” “And this guy behind me…who is he? He looks like a broke Tiger Woods, a broke, Caucasian Tiger Woods. Imagine looking like a broke Tiger Woods? And who do I look like? I’ve gotten Matthew Modine, Jeff Bridges, Paul Walker, and Carey Elwes more than once or twice.” “And that woman over there…the stewardess, look at her ass. I guess it’s nice. I wonder if stewardess’s were ever bombshells? I guess there must be one or two out there. Maybe on Lufthansa or Air Arabia, or something. And then I recalled the time I asked the stewardess out before I got off that flight in JFK. I gave her my number. She must have been 50 or 60, she was round, with blonde hair. Christ, she must have had five or six kids. She looked at me, she said “okay” and I walked off. I think I heard paper crumpling…” “And Lufthansa! Ah! My dad, my poor dad, he used to fly Lufthansa. He was stuck in Brooklyn, trying to make quarters fart. Wishing his way to happiness. I could sob, but I was in such a state of denial that tears wouldn’t come. Tears wouldn’t flow. I figured the faucets had been turned off forever…” “And the drinks beign poured on the plane. I saw a bloody Mary. Grape juice. Apple juice. Orange juice. Little ice cold waters.” “And somebody is up in front taking a shit…I’m sure of it…” “This pilot better fucking get us there in one piece…” “They say you wouldn’t feel it if you crashed. You’d either have a heart attack in your great state of free falling shock or you would just be obliterated, crushed in a swimming tear of gasoline and satanic dust and blood. Oh, fuck. And what about that position they tell you to get into when you’re crashing, that tucking position. Christ, I can’t do that. I can’t fucking tuck. I gotta look around, see all the broken necks, see my own broken neck. It’s like when they tell you to get under a table in an earthquake? Have you ever tried to get under a table in an earthquake? You can’t move in an earthquake. There’s no getting under tables in an earthquake. There is only blank fear. Blank unknowing. Blank curiosity…” I start to feel my balls sweat. This, mind you, is all happening within minutes of sitting down. I immediately hold onto my lovely girlfriend’s hand. Her little hand. Her little hand that loved to sew and paint. I loved her little hands. I would do anything for her little hands. I would certainly die, take a bullet for her little hands. Her little hands and crimson-tipped hair. I start feeling a tremor building up around my heart space. My heart is beating like a Stallion. Literally erupting our of my chest. As if I was getting ready to enter some Gladiator ring, awaiting a rabid pair of lions that haven’t eaten in weeks. I’m their food, and goddammit I can’t take it! But I sit there. I’m whisper quiet. I can’t speak. I’m liable to be arrested and carried into some grey, dank office at the FBI headqauters in Reseda or something. Their liable to stick a big black plunger in my ass and never let me out of some room the size of an elevator. The guy with the giant gut has sat down. I hear a gentleman behind me order a Vodka on the rocks. “Vodka on the rocks?” I think, what the fuck, we haven’t even taken off yet. A baby starts screaming bloody murder. What the fuck is going on with that baby! I wanna yell, “Goddamit, what the fuck is going on with that baby! Goddamit, someone help me!” But, I’m like a stone sitting there. A stone about to erupt. A stone with a bubbling Mount Vesuvius style volcano deep in it’s core. A very scared, shaking, sad, unfortunate stone. But then my right leg starts to bounce up and down. My girlfriend, fuck, I can remember her there. Leaning her gentle head on the window, watching something dull. She was was so gorgeous that day. She was such a pretty girl. She was so excited to show me the sky in Montana, she was so excited to show me the rivers, she was so excited to camp with me, she was so excited to watch me pick peaches off her father’s trees, she was so excited for me to meet the farm dogs, run with her through the fields, watch the stars twinkle… And I knew I couldn’t do it. I hadn’t excavated myself enough. I was short-circuiting. I think the guy next to me ordered another vodka. I could barely get a whisper of a breath down my throat. I could barely feel my hands. My limbs were going completely numb. The only feeling I had left was in the middle of my chest, except my legs were bouncing up and down on the floor under their own volition... I turned to my girl, “Hi…” “Hey,” she smiled, and then I saw her face change when she saw me. She looked at me like a second nose was growing on my forehead, or like a big, giant dick had suddenly released itself on the top of my head. It was an Academy Award winning look she gave, although this was no film, this was no episode of The Twilight Zone. She was silent. Almost pale. I turned away from her, I waved to the stewardess with the big ass. Some lilting, half-dead hand. “Water, may I have some water?” And she knew right away, “Are you okay?” “Can I have some water?” She asked again, “Are you okay?” And then the guy with the Vodkas leaned into me, “Hey, buddy, you alright?” and I saw his face, drunk already, totally sauced, ready to party, but really, sincerely looking concerned for my wellbeing. “Yeah,” I said, “yeah, I’m good,” feeling the veins in my neck pulsing through my jean jacket. “Babe…” my girl said. I looked at her. I looked at the stewardess. I looked at the drunken man. I heard the baby. I thought about getting pneumonia in Spain. I thought about the beaches in Bilbao. My mind had escaped me, it jumped ship. Thoughts started wandering through my mind like little, deaf men in suits. DING, I heard the captain, Yello, thisisyurcaptainspeakinglookslikewegotaslightlybumpyflightcominourwayahhhhhhhhhhhh… Slightly bumpy flight, I heard, absolutely fixated on the negative, fixated on the ruining of me. I stood up. I heard a stewardess in the front of the plane call out that they were closing the doors… My mind, again, wandering down really weird alleys of my being. I want pussy. I want drugs. I want cyanide. I want to get married. I want to kill. Homicide. Rage. Suicide. Anything. Anything. Goddamit, that baby! My skin was pale. I looked at my hands. My once veinous hands were now stripped of blood. “Babe, I think I, uh, gotta go…” I lurched up in the aisle. The drunken man told me if I only had a vodka I’d be okay, have a vodka, have a nice big vodka he said, hey, Kid! have urrrself a nice big vodka!!! And then the stewardess moved aside. The whole plane staring at my petrified figure. My vision myopic. I heard the stewardess mumble down into some earpiece or something, “He’s coming. Yep, he’s getting off…” Was I being watched? Why did she say “Yep,” like that? Did she know I was losing my mind? Was it that obvious? I didn’t recall her watching me at all. Did this happen all the time? I felt great waves of embarrassment and fear and deed, bone marrow deep sadness wash over me. The fear of ineptitude sinking into me. Dissapointment. My girl, I was leaving her, I felt like a coward, stripped of my testicles, stripped of my bravery, stripped down to the bone… I didn’t know what to do. I had never felt these feelings before. This short circuiting. I couldn’t speak intelligibly. I exited the plane and fell onto my back in that tube you walk through. The tube suspended in air. I fell onto my back. The tears now jetting out of my eyes. I was so sad to have left her on the plane. I couldn't do anything about it. I couldn’t see. I was freezing. The cold tarmac air rushed through some hole next to my face. I couldn’t find forgiveness. I could only find destitution, bewilderment, self-pity. I sobbed. Yes! Yes! Yes! Where the fuck was I! Who was I! A ruined, erupted spirit lying in 21st century shit. My arms were flailing, falling open. I was a half-assed Jesus, so tired, so alone. And then a face appeared, and another face. The stewardess with the ass stood over me. Her Asian face in a gesture of I’m sorry mixed with eyes glancing at her watch like we gotta get this facing plane off the ground. And there was another man. One of the guys whoe directed the planes on the tarmac. He was holding that glowing yellow stick in his hand. He had on an orange neon jumpsuit. I wanted to grab his leg and beg for mercy. I needed some speck of safety, some speck of something. “I left her,” I said, as quietly as I could, tears bundled up around my chin, “Oh fuck, oh fuck, I left her…” And then, by some grace, she was there. The third face in that grey tube. It was her. Her with her crimson-tipped hair. And the tears dried up. And the vibe moved through me…leaving me there to pick up the pieces as I drove home to the valley, desperate, confused, riddled with fear and trembling. Wondering, where oh where might hope come from…",2017

I’ll have to be institutionalized, and that’ll drain all of my parent’s money. They’ll die from the stress of taking care of me, and then I’ll be all alone. I’ll die alone and nobody will know and nobody will care. It’ll be fine. Breathe out. 1… 2… 3… My friends are going on a trip without me. They think I’m not going because I’m flaky and poor and I’m not committed to our friendship. And because I’m not on the trip, they’re going to talk about me and these things, and then collectively decide that I’m a terrible friend. They’ll grow closer, and decide that I’m not worthy of our friend group anymore. They’ll stop inviting me to things, and I’m not assertive, so I won’t ask to hang out. We’ll grow apart, and then I won’t have any friends in this city. I’ll get depressed because I have no friends. I’ll probably commit suicide, and then they won’t know or care, and then I’ll die alone. They probably won’t come to my funeral either. This was 20 minutes in the life of my anxiety. These are my just my first thoughts as I try to fall asleep on an ordinary Tuesday night. But instead of calming myself down, thinking logically, and coming back to reality, I begin to spiral. These stories centered around my faults and insecurities will continue to write themselves in my mind anywhere from 30 minutes to three hours to six hours, until I finally drift off to a restless sleep with only a few hours before sunrise left to spare. Without a fully rested brain, I am tightly wound and foggy the entire next day. I feel a tension in my chest that only grows as the day goes on. No matter what happens during that day, everything is wrong, everything is doomed. When the sun finally sets, I agonize over whether tonight will be the same as the last. Again, I close my eyes and hope for the best. If I’m lucky, I’ll get another three hours of sleep amid a whole new flood of catastrophic, hypothetical scenarios. This was a day in the life of my anxiety. If you had asked me a year ago if I thought that this chronic insomnia and catastrophizing was a problem, I’d have told you no. I thought this was just the way things were, and how they were going to stay. I’m just a worrier, that’s who I am. Sure, I hadn’t gotten a full night’s sleep in about a year. Sure, I’d constantly convince myself that everyone hated me. Sure, I couldn’t ride on a fast train without being sure that it was going to derail, nor could I fly on a plane because I knew crashing was inevitable. Sure, I thought my whole world was going to fall apart because of one small reprimand. But doesn’t everyone think this way? I knew anxiety was a thing that afflicted some people, but I didn’t think I was one of them. I thought I was mentally stronger than something like anxiety. Actually, I thought I was mentally stronger than any mental illness. What I didn’t realize, what I didn’t want to admit, is that anxiety is in fact a serious mental illness that had been ravaging my life and my happiness for far too long. I have always been a mildly nervous person to some extent, but in the past few years this nervousness has turned from bothersome to debilitating. If I had to pinpoint the turn for the worse, it came during a deep depression I fell into in the winter of 2013. Its catalyst was what I considered to be two major personal failures, which lead to months of feelings of worthlessness and hopelessness. For months, all I saw ahead of me was a lifetime of pain and failure. Why continue to live? After all, life is just pain and then you die, right? Having been severely depressed in the past, I knew what this was and deep down I had faith that I’d get through it, just as I had before. I wasn’t wrong. I did get better, but when I finally began to recover, I noticed a lingering feeling of uneasiness that didn’t subside. No matter what I did, I couldn’t get that uneasy feeling to go away or even lessen. It grew from the occasional worry to full-fledged panic spirals. I should have known that I needed help when it started to manifest itself physically. No matter how tired I was, I couldn’t sleep. For days. For weeks. And the lack of sleep only sunk me deeper into my spirals. My 15 year struggle with bulimia was reinvigorated, uncontrollable, and annihilated any positive relationship I’d built with food or my body (I know now that anxiety is a major part of what feeds that beast). I also started compulsively picking at my skin, creating scars and leaving deep, painful cuts. I was quite literally worrying myself to death. I wish I could tell you that my path to recovery after realizing I needed help was a quick and seamless one, but thanks to my stubbornness, and ironically, my anxiety over getting help, it was anything but. After a stern recommendation to see a psychiatrist from my primary doctor, I continued to wait and refuse to admit that I may be suffering from a mental illness. Much of my denial comes from my experience growing up with a bipolar mother. Her symptoms are so extreme that they’re almost impossible to cope with at times. I had always thought that if bipolar was what it meant to be mentally ill, then I was nowhere close. When I finally did make my first appointment with a psychiatrist, I agonized over the decision alone for weeks. I have always been firmly anti-medication, believing that the body is plenty capable of healing and regulating itself if given the proper care. I knew she’d want to give me “happy pills,” and I was afraid of how they might change me. Would I be a walking zombie, devoid of all emotions and personality? Would I become numb to everything and everyone like Zach Braff’s character in Garden State? What if people found out I was on medication, would they think of me differently? Though the stigma around mental illness is beginning to wane, it is by no means extinct. It’s a small miracle that I fought through these thoughts long enough to actually keep my appointment and meet the woman who would ultimately change my life for the better. Today, I am seven months into my treatment for anxiety. Everything is not perfect. I am not cured. But I am coming a little closer every day. Through a combination of medication and therapy, two things I’d always told myself I’d never need, I am slowly but surely learning what it means to free. Free of constant regret, worry, and fear. Though I’ve come a long way towards recovery, I’ve had more than a handful of setbacks. While I may initially see the inevitable catastrophe play out, I have learned that I am powerful enough to change the course of those narratives. This journey isn’t an easy one, it takes work and patience, but in the short time that I’ve been able to finally sleep and exhale again, I can’t imagine going on the way I had been. I know now that the real catastrophe would have been continuing to live under the weight of my crushing anxiety. This is seven months in the life of my anxiety. This is seven months in my life of learning that asking for help is okay. This is seven months in my life of learning to take one step at a time. This is seven months in my life of being less afraid, but accepting that being afraid is normal. This is seven months in my life of finally sleeping again. Finally dreaming again. Finally breathing again. This is seven months in my life of overcoming anxiety.",2017
"If you’re not okay, stop saying you’re okay.","Your workload is overbearing. But it’s okay. You missed a deadline. But you’ll make up for it. You’re late for work again. But you aren’t really late for anything. You are checking your phone on the highway because that’s the only time you really have to do it. But the cop didn’t see you. Your mindfulness app keeps telling you ‘It’s time to get some Headspace’. But you’ll try to make time for it tomorrow instead. The pot is boiling over. You’ve bit off way more than you can chew. The candle is burning at every end, every side, every corner. And then… you crash. And that crash may set you back. And you might cry harder than you’ve ever cried in your entire life. But it’s okay. The important thing is to stop. Stop saying you’re okay. As much as we encourage talking about it, mental health is a fragile topic. And something that everyone experiences differently — but each and every one of our experiences is just as important as the other. In honour of #BellLetsTalk day, being open and honest about the way you’re feeling, regardless of whether you think “it’s severe enough to discuss”, is the most important thing you can do for yourself. In the last month I have had countless conversations about the importance of mental health because it just recently became incredibly apparent in my life. I caught myself consistently playing the role of The Hero — taking on a workload that was entirely exhausting and unmanageable — and feeling like I didn’t need to ask for help. And that’s when I had a mental breakdown. Sometimes I think stress is like an addiction. Some of us have learned to run away from it, some of us have a tolerance to it, and others allow it to consume them. For me, stress has always been a judgement of how much I could handle; thinking that “if I take on more, once I’m over this hurdle, it will get easier the next time around”. But like any addiction, it eventually gets the best of us. I realized pushing myself beyond my own limit wasn’t helping anyone. And I definitely wasn’t helping myself. After taking a much needed break, having an honest talk with myself, and being supported by a great friend every step of the way, I got back on my feet and was ready to take on this thing we call life again. But I’ve tread lightly. I wasn’t about to jump right back in to my old ways. Instead, I set out a plan for myself. I started 2017 with a fresh mind and a dedicated commitment to Me Time. In a world filled with other things always needing your attention, it’s important to step away, focus on yourself, and take a break. This is what I was continually putting off, and naturally other things came crumbling down with it. Set time for yourself like it’s the only thing you have to do in this world, because at the end of the day, you are the most important — and, frankly, the only — person that matters. Don’t let you get away from you. - C",2017
A Letter To My Dad About My Anxiety,"Before anything else, I must say thank you. For 24 years you have supported me without end and have loved me unconditionally, even when you weren’t sure how to. I have not often stopped to consider how hard you work to live in my world and be there for me, but I am so grateful. There is so much I wish to say in order to explain what anxiety is like, what I have learned from it, and what it means for those I love. I‘ve been wanting to write this for a long time. I originally wanted to write it for myself, to help me articulate my struggle with anxiety. But I realized that if I were to ever write it, it would need to be addressed to you. You’re my best friend and I can’t be anything but honest and open with you. You instill strength and hope in me every single day. I know you have often felt frustrated trying to understand what my anxiety is like and how you can help. So let me try to put it into words. Anxiety is not the same as worrying, although people often equate the two as synonyms. Anxiety is not like the “anxious” feeling someone has before a big speech or test. Think of it as an eery house. Imagine you are sitting in the living room of someone else’s house, located in the middle of nowhere. It is late at night and you are completely alone, having just watched a horror film. Every little noise and every little rustle or creek, which wouldn’t cause a reaction during the day, causes your heart to start pounding and a wave of fear to wash over you. With anxiety we become sensitive to everything around us, paralyzed by the overwhelming noise that takes over our senses. There is no peak followed by relief; it just keeps building and building. What would seem like simple things to others become overwhelming to us. Anxiety is not just all in the mind. The entire body reacts to it: headaches, throbbing, stomach pain, ringing in the ears, etc. Anxiety puts our entire body into an exhausting state of heightened awareness. The fight or flight response is active, we are hyper-tense, and we begin overanalyzing every little thing as a threat. Our minds don’t stop ruminating, which is entirely tiring and exhausting. We feel like a prisoner in our own mind and body. Sending an email? Answering a text? Trying to explain to someone why we’re not acting like ourself? These simple tasks become incredibly daunting and, although they seem so easy to the normal person, those of us with anxiety require a great deal of courage and strength to get through these. Anxiety isn’t rational. It is not a cause and effect relationship that can be predicted. It is not just an amplified version of worry, where there is a specific trigger. It’s a misfiring of our brain’s fight or flight mechanisms that can happen for no recognizable reason. Having a life-changing condition dismissed as worrying is difficult to hear. It takes courage to battle anxiety every day. People may think that we aren’t thinking positively enough. It’s not that we don’t think positively or that we don’t try -it’s just difficult when anxiety hijacks our body and minds. We often feel detached from ourselves. The repetition of thoughts that go through our mind can be hard to turn off, making us feel out of control and afraid. I will constantly rethink a sentence I said yesterday or a year ago and wondering if I upset someone by it. When I share something vulnerable I will stay awake for hours, wondering if the other person now sees me differently and if I should have said nothing. I will likely be staying up late questioning every sentence of this post. Almost anything can be a trigger for rumination. Intellectually we know that the mental processes behind our anxiety are irrational, but as far as our brains are concerned, there is no difference between what we imagine and what is real. Even if others see our anxiety as irrational, we want them to recognize that for us it is very real. What I Want You To Know If anxiety were a visible illness, you would see my battle scars, Dad. You would see the bruises where the anxiety beats me up on the inside. But it’s not visible and oftentimes it may not look like you would expect it to. Sometimes my anxiety looks cranky, depressed, silent, angry or frustrated. Don’t take it personally. Know that I am trying to handle it as best I can. If I talk about my anxiety with you, know that it is incredibly difficult and vulnerable for me, so it means a lot for me to share. In the end, I just want to know that I am brave. I want my struggle to be validated, even if it is not fully understood. I want to know that I am not seen differently because of my struggle, but that I’m still loved and I am enough just as I am, even when I feel out of control. I don’t want to be defined by the label of anxiety, but want to be recognized for the culmination of what makes me who I am. I don’t want advice (unless I ask for it). I simply want to hear that you have no desire to change or fix me. I want to know that you are in my corner. Listening, hugging, and validating are the most powerful tools you have. Some days I may need space and some days I may need your presence, so ask me what I need and I will let you know. Sometimes it may look like I’m trying to control everything, but please don’t mistake my need to control my environment with my need to control people. I am simply trying to feel safe and avoid an anxiety takeover. Sometimes I might come off as a perfectionist, but the truth is that the endless tapes of self-criticism and fear of failure are often driving me and I am daily trying to quiet them. Part of managing anxiety is controlling this inner monologue. This takes a lot of concentration and so I may suddenly grow quiet. At times, I may be angry with myself for not having “better control.” I might seem like someone who cancels plans a lot. I don’t do this lightly. It actually causes me more stress because I worry about disappointing others. Know that I’m not saying no to you; I’m saying no to potential anxiety attacks. Why I Am Grateful Dad, despite the struggles of my anxiety, you have given me the support that I need to see my anxiety as a blessing. If I had the opportunity to take my anxiety away, I wouldn’t. Is it a daily battle? Absolutely. But you have reminded me that the scars of anxiety are not physical marks on the body. The scars of anxiety are deep compassion and empathy. Because I have struggled daily, I am more sensitive to you and your needs and struggles. Because I have struggled with having a label of anxiety, I will never see you as a label or judge you for your own path. Because I daily fight the battles of anxiety, I am stronger and more reliant on God. Because my thoughts can easily overtake me, I have learned the importance of self-examination and sorting the truths from the lies. Because I know my own vulnerability, I will listen intently when you need to share your own struggles and I will know that it takes a lot of courage for you to do so. More than anything, I hope that you can be proud of me — not in spite of my struggle with anxiety, but because of my struggle with anxiety. Thank you for listening without demanding an explanation for my thoughts and behaviors and without giving advice. Thank you for simply staying with me when I’m struggling. Thank you for seeing that this is not just stress, and for encouraging me time and again. Most of all, thank you for loving me as I am.",2017
Recess: An Open Discussion,"On Oct.20th our team hosted a discussion panel of four guest speakers who shared with an audience the negative events in their lives that forced them to deconstruct and rebuild. The panel took place in the new Lululemon Athletica community space and was the very first instalment of our Recess series, an ongoing programme of discussions and workshops that focus on mental health, learning new skills and creating safe, curious spaces. Despite it being a rainy Toronto evening, the turnout was incredible. For one of the speakers, the pivotal moment was a near-death experience. For another, a family tragedy. For a third it was a moment of pure existential panic, an epiphany of paralyzing fear while stuck in a crowded subway train — what some would call a severe anxiety attack. Every guest’s experience was unique but all served as catalysts for much-needed change. Through the adversity came newfound skills that allowed them to take a break from daily stress and embrace a platform that led to connection and self-care, whether it was through photography, yoga, or starting a charity dedicated to human rights. We were impressed by our speakers’ vulnerability but even more so by the reactions of the audience. Anxiety is so rarely spoken about yet we could see its prevalence in our community from the nods of affirmation; people could relate. One audience member even shared her own personal battle with anxiety. And as the discussion moved forward into tips for finding new passions, stillness, and mindful existence, the words of our panelist’s mental health specialist Kaajal resounded more than ever: there is no ‘cure’ for mental health issues, it’s a process. The Recess series is a means to capture that process.

Let’s Talk — My Struggles with Anxiety.,"There has been a lot of talk lately at Guelph about mental health and seeing that it is the annual “#BellLetsTalk” day, I figured it was time for me to share the struggles I have been dealing with over the past couple years because it has always felt like something I needed to hide and that I’ve been afraid to share with people. During my second year at university, and I found myself becoming increasingly stressed out over school, at first I tried to brush it off and I told myself things like “it’s university, everyone is stressed”, or I would convince myself that I was just making it up and that there’s people who actually are struggling and I’m just exaggerating. But, things got worse and it eventually got to the point where I stopped going to class because I thought everyone could tell that I was struggling as if there was some sort of neon sign pointing me out to everyone, as a result I started struggling with work and trying to complete assignments would result in me experiencing panic attacks, and then because I was so scared of having panic attacks I would just avoid assignments. This all built up until one point at the middle of the semester I went to class, only to find the professor spent most of the class talking about an assignment that I hadn’t completed and I could feel the panic building up inside me. I ended up leaving the class and found myself at the walk-in sessions for counselling on campus. That moment was crucial for me, I am so grateful for the counselling services on campus. The resources and support I received are what helped me make it to the end of the semester. I ended up taking the following semester off to step back from school and the stress and really think about where I wanted and needed to be. The entire time I was back home all I could think about was how I wanted to be back in Guelph, and how despite the struggles I had dealt with I still wanted to be in university and learning. So I came back in the fall and decided that I was going to switch programs. That first semester back wasn’t without its own challenges. I continued to go to counselling on campus, but I also made the choice to see a doctor about medication to help manage my anxiety. I ended up on a daily medication, and while I was hopeful that it would help, I found myself feeling exhausted and emotionless. I felt like a zombie going through my everyday motions but not feeling anything. After returning to the campus doctor and not feeling like my concerns with the side effects were being heard I went home to talk to my family doctor and made the decision to stop taking medication. This was an upsetting time for me because I came to realize that I would have to find a way to cope with my anxiety and that there would be no easy fix. I knew that I could no longer ignore the anxiety I was feeling because I had seen the effect it had the year before. During this semester I had also attended a few meetings for a social anxiety support group on campus, which sounds like the complete opposite of the type of situation someone with social anxiety would want to be in. But, it ultimately helped me think about my anxiety in a different way and helped me to challenge my boundaries. I began to set goals for myself, I started trying to go out more and spend more time with friends. I worked up the courage to see a movie by myself and eventually even attended a music festival by myself. I was doing well in school and found different ways to help manage my anxiety around assignments and exams. And even though I have been getting better at coping, I still have bad days, and there are still times when I my anxiety creeps up on me and makes it feel like the simplest tasks are impossible. I still find myself avoiding interaction with people, or feeling anxious when I do interact with others or getting anxious about school and stress when it feels like things are piling up. I still have nights where I’m exhausted and all I want to do is fall asleep but I can’t stop replaying a conversation I had where I maybe thought I came off weird or annoying or rude, even though at the same time I know these thoughts are irrational. Even the thought of posting this makes me feel anxious. I don’t know if I’ll ever get to a point where my anxiety isn’t a daily battle for me, but I know I have supportive friends and family that I can turn to when it gets a little too overwhelming and I can’t manage on my own. Because after all, as cheesy as it may sound, life isn’t about waiting for the storm to pass, it’s about learning to dance in the rain. And sometimes to dance in the rain you need a little bit of help.",2017
MIRROR OF ME- The power of anxiety and what it can do to your body and mind,"The Power Anxiety Has Over Me I am a person with severe anxiety. Sometimes I feel captive to myself and other times I’m just distantly numb from the burden. I know at this stage in my life, I am who I am, and that’s okay because I have learned how to live with my anxiety. It first began for me on the stage while dancing. I used to think that it was my nerves getting the best of me. However, the feeling never left when the curtain closed and I was left with that twisting in my gut, the feeling of panic, the feeling that that just sits in the back of your throat and won’t go away. It’s the mirror of me reflecting this person I do not want to be. This is anxiety. What does anxiety feel like to me? It’s a natural sensation that ruminates inside of my veins. It watches my every move during the day and makes sure that I know it is present. I do feel it’s presence and sometimes it’s painfully noticeable on the outside. However, most of the time it is hidden so deep that it’s not visible to those around me. It leads me within my structured path and constantly challenges my brain to change which then forces me to fight this force. When I start my day, I wake up a little bit groggy because my sleep schedule is constantly interrupted by my itching thoughts. I usually wake up around 2 am from a myriad of concerns and it goes a little something like this: Are the kids happy? Does my husband know he’s loved? Am I healthy? What’s that ache? Do I need to go to the doctor? I need more money. How can I make more money? Am I going to have enough money to pay the bills? Are we ever going to be able to go on another vacation? It’s not fair that I think about everything. Why do I feel so much? Why am I always so concerned about other people and their well being? Is it to distract me from my own emotions? Yep, that’s just in the first 5 minutes of reality. After that, it’s a battle to fall back asleep and sometimes it gets me out of bed in the middle of the night. I always turn to crossword puzzles, which does nothing for my sleep and only stimulates my brain. Awesome! I’m doing something educational, but sleep deprived. When it’s time to get ready, I pop out of bed like the weasel, running the race against time and checking my cell phone every 5 minutes for new emails. It drives me nuts. Once I get into the shower, that feeling starts; The anxious feeling. It sits in a clump at the back of my throat. It’s not a sharp or dull pain, but it’s aggravating. It’s like the annoying feeling of having a splinter stuck in your skin; you definitely feel it until it’s taken out. Unfortunately, that remedy doesn’t work too well for anxiety. Otherwise, I would be the first one in line, blasting through every dollar I had, just to eliminate my nervousness. As the day moves forward and I begin my work day, the feeling remains. In fact, it remains all day, until I go to bed at night. I constantly bounce my leg until it aches. I get up and I sit down and then go on repeat. My day is like watching the water boil. When is this going to happen? When is that going to happen? How much longer? So many things are just out of my control and I hate that more than anything. I can’t accept it and damn it, I wish I could so badly. Did you know that there are people who deny the fact that anxiety exists? I can’t tell you how many times I have had people tell me to stop worrying or to stop being so nervous. Who the hell wants to feel like this? If I could turn it off, I would. Sure, I will stop worrying and being so nervous on command. Done! If that could be, then the drug companies wouldn’t have created some of these amazing pills for sufferers. I am not supporting their behavior in our health care crisis by any means. They are a big part of the problem. What I am saying is that if it weren’t for therapists and these life changing drugs, my life, as well as others that live with anxiety, couldn’t get any relief. What does relief mean to me? It doesn’t mean taking away the symptoms or making me feel like a different person. It lessens the intensity and seems to calm my responses. They are definitely not miracle pills, but they have aided many people, including myself, in understanding to take a step back. Some people are able to remain in this state and go off of the pills, while others remain on them forever. Unfortunately, I fall in the latter. Anxiety is definitely a big part of my life and it’s funny because most people don’t know I have it unless I tell them. My nerves do not come and go for me. They are always there and it makes me, me. Although anxiety seems to be looked at in a more negative light for me, there are some positives that come with it too. Phew! I am always alert. I know where all the exits are in any place I go. I look around a lot to know my surroundings. I’m the first one to slam on the breaks and do a 180 back to school if anyone hurts my child. In my eyes, you are guilty til proven innocent. No, I’m not that harsh, but trust is a really big thing. Trusting someone allows you to naturally calm, so I tend to stay away from people that naturally stir the pot of drama soup. I talk a lot. A. lot. I’m not sure if it’s my nerves or my genuine friendliness. Maybe, it’s a combo of both. Either one, it’s who I am. I always get the job done, most of the time in fear of failure, and I’m always the first one to arrive when meeting people. No one knows the real reason, except for those close to me. Ask my husband and he will tell you I definitely have issues with time! I don’t remember the exact first time I felt really anxious, but from a young age I knew I felt something. As I got older, I would be drawn to people that had unworkable problems, and I would just listen, and actually feel the emotions that were being expelled. I wanted to help. I always want to help and offer my excellent “been there, done that advice!” Seriously, I’m quite the doc without the Phd. It makes me happy to help others, but it also makes me feel really good to see the other person enlightened by what I’ve said and it can be very soothing to me. Now that I’m officially an adult with a family, I guess I have to be honest with myself about my anxiety. I am someone who has a great deal of anxiety, worries about everything and always want to control the situation, but I am also very loving, trustworthy, driven, and a happy girl carrying a lot of fancy handbags on my journey. Baggage just sounds bad, plus I will be collecting more “handbags” along the way, so I should get used to the weight, if you catch my drift….",2017
My Story for #BellLetsTalk Day,"To be quite honest, I don’t really know how to talk about my anxiety. It is a hard, complicated thing for me. For years, I’ve struggled with it. I thought it controlled my life and that it was something I would never be able to beat. I could spend all day going on about what my anxiety did to me and the awful stuff I went through for 12 years, while I was trying to deal with it. There have been times when I’ve wanted to give up, and times when I wanted to throw in the towel and call it quits because sometimes, no matter what you do, it just never felt like it would ever get better. For me, my anxiety was not just this mental illness that cast a shadow over every part of my life but something else, something else causing all these awful feelings and thoughts inside me. It was something that had haunted me for years that I was just not willing or ready to deal with yet. This post is about that. This post is about what led to me getting through my anxiety and getting to a place where I could manage it on my own and let it control my life no longer. Today is about talking and sharing and showing that there is no shame in having mental health issues or struggling with things beyond your control, so I am going to talk about it. I was sexually molested and abused from the ages of 8–11 by someone I knew and trusted. That is a sentence I’ve never said out loud before. That is a sentence I did not think I would ever put in words for everyone to see and hear. But here we are. That is what led to my years of anxiety and depression and was something that I did not deal with until 6 months ago. 6 months ago was when I had a mental breakdown from carrying the weight of what happened to me (and all of the anxiety and depression that came with it) for 10 years. I did not get help overnight. Hell, it took me 3 years to come to terms with what had happened before I could even consider telling anyone or getting myself help. I continued to struggle with my anxiety as it got worse but I realized that it was okay not to hide it. It was okay that I struggled and sure enough, I started to realize I was not alone. It surprised me how much people cared. It surprised me that no one saw me any differently because of my anxiety, or my past with abuse. For me, talking to people helped. I found a good therapist, I started talking more, I started opening up more, and I realized my past and my anxiety don’t define me. That is why I am writing this today, because what happened to me does not define who I am as a person. I am stronger than my anxiety and I am more powerful than the abuse. I want people to see and to know that I am okay and that getting through whatever you are going through is always possible. There will be days where it does not feel like it and there will be days where it does not seem worth fighting anymore, but I assure you that it is always worth it and it is always possible to find help and to get better. If my post helps even one person today then writing this and telling you all my story will have been worth it. Happy #BellLetsTalk day.",2017
Dear Doctor…,"Hi Amy, As you know, my physical is in less than two weeks. Holy crap. It’s actually in eight days. I need to confess the things I’ve been doing the last several weeks in order to prepare for our appointment. Here goes: Much love and much more apologizing, Kat",2017
When the body knows…,"I haven’t written in three months. I mean, I have, of course, but it’s been dreck, drivel, little whiny bursts to prove that, in that tiny moment, I was still kicking even as I sank into the dark, cold, airless abyss. ::kick…kick:: Every word felt hollow. Every concept felt impotent. So many things to address, so many feelings to explain, so many connections to attempt, and yet even beginning to attack them left me exhausted and empty. And so yesterday I ended up in a doctor’s office. I never go to the doctor’s. It’s a constant battle with the GF, whether or not I get to my physical every year. But a few days ago, noticed that my heart was just…flying. Fast beats, making my hands tremble, pulling me out of sleep, short breaths. The first two days were pure physiology and I could kind of marvel at it — what could be causing this? Does meditation help? Does anything change it? And then logic kicked in and I realized that I was experiencing, possibly, the symptoms of a heart attack. And then, suddenly, it became panic. Full on. So, the doctor’s office. Where I explained that yes, while I’d had “panic attacks” before, they were short and I knew how to work through them so much so that you’d never really know that one was happening. Anyway, I was never diagnosed or anything. And they never felt like this. Not like this. This seemed different. So armed with my heart rate and blood pressure, following an EKG and a volley of very sympathetic lady doctors and techs and nurses, it was determined that I was probably just in the middle of an incredibly protracted panic attack. A panic attack! For FOUR DAYS. The nice NP who was working with me asked if there had been any triggers and I just looked at her and laughed sardonically, “You mean, like, the world?” And she smiled and wrote something down (I’m assuming it was shorthand for, “yeah, she’s nuts” or the like), and said, kindly, “but nothing specific?” “No. Nothing specific.” “Maybe,” she suggested gently, “your body knows something your head doesn’t.” Maybe. Maybe my body is watching the rights that define my country stripped away with speed and calculation without an opposing voice anywhere but from those of us who are powerless as best, mocked and derided by our elected officials, at worst. Maybe my body is scared for the future, because for so many of us, it is so, so uncertain. Maybe my body has just had its fill of callous, cruel people who live lives so far away from what the majority of us experience being in control of so much. I keep wanting to appeal to compassion, “the kumbaya”, as some among us call it. Because I do believe that history has demonstrated that to change minds, you have to appeal to the heart. Protests may effect legislative change, but what we really need is for people to change. It’s slow and tedious but I believe that that’s where lasting change comes from. But at the same time, I’m at the point where punching nazis and telling those who support the Dear Leader that there are no redeeming qualities that I can see in them or him is all I got. I believe in compassion, but I’m too tired to coax someone through to seeing that someone deserves the same shit they have, regardless. I’m too tired to explain (again) that your beliefs have no place in government when they take away my rights to health and safety. I’m too fucking tired to try to figure out ways to fight a government that is hell bent on denying information to its citizens. And so apparently, (back to the point), my body knew. I was trucking along, thinking everything was fine, and my body finally said, “Nope. Shit is fucked.” Anyway. I’ve written something now, and maybe tomorrow my heart will decide to settle on some beats-per-minute that are less…terrifying.",2017
It’s not always just a “teenage phase”,"In 2016, I was interning at eTalk, a Bell Media entertainment news show based in Toronto. I had the opportunity to help produce their #BellLetsTalk special, a wide-reaching, multi-year program designed to break the silence around mental illness and support mental health all across Canada. This prompted me to break my own silence. So let’s talk. Let’s talk about the year 2010. In 2010 my mother’s cancer returned, after being in remission. In 2010 my father suffered from a stroke. In 2010 both my parents were in and out of the hospital, which left my older brother and I juggling between school, activities and taking care of our 6-year-old brother. In 2010 I was diagnosed with clinical depression and anxiety. Although I tried to live like any other 16-year-old, I was battling an inner turmoil. I refused to admit to myself, or accept the fact, that I wasn’t happy, in hopes I was undergoing a “teenage phase”. Though I was always a seemingly upbeat person, behind closed doors I spent several nights crying, growing very frustrated with myself. I thought it would be selfish of me to give my parents something else to worry about, but when things only got worst, I told them I wasn’t okay. I reached out and got help. Talking to people was the best decision I made in my life. I think the scary thing about depression is that it can affect the people you least expect it; not everyone is as transparent as we presume. We fear vulnerability (or at least I do) and therefore keep such battles concealed. I never “embodied” depression, and tried to diverge from any portrayals that may have revealed my struggle. I was in the arts program, played sports, socialized, got straight A’s, and although it seemed like I had a good grasp on my life, I realized that I just couldn’t control how I felt. Today I can confidently say that I am at peace with myself, and have developed a vitality and appreciation for life — I have been depression and anxiety free for six years now. My past experience with depression and anxiety has always been something I didn’t want to discuss or reveal. I was ashamed, which is a direct result of the societal stigma #BellLetsTalk is trying to conquer. I’m beginning to embrace what I’ve been through; after all, it has only shaped who I am and my overall outlook. I look back at that 16-year-old girl and see a far cry from the person I am today, but I thank her for seeking help. I encourage people, today and everyday, to educate themselves. From someone who has experienced mental illness first hand, it isn’t something one can control or simply overcome: it is a chemical imbalance. Just like the flu or even cancer, it is an illness, and not something one “chooses” to have. Although my circumstances may validate why I went through what I went through, at the end of the day, depression doesn’t need validation. Depression isn’t always a result of the “well, they have been through so much” ideology. So talk. Talk your hearts out. Share your stories, don’t undermine your thoughts and feelings, and don’t be ashamed. The most comforting thing in the world is knowing that you’re not alone. And I’m with ya.

Bathroom Prayers,"Not what you think… In university it was funny. So many times I’ve knelt down in that common dorm bathroom after a messy night of bar hopping through Olean. It was typical behaviour for most of us during those years, and I can laugh as I reflect on what were some pretty wild days. Now my bathroom prayers have changed. The tile and porcelain play a much different role in my life. The bathroom has become my refuge. My place of escape to hide my anxiety. It’s where I go to lay on the floor when my mind can’t stop racing. It’s where I go to kneel in prayer when my heart feels full. It’s where I go to clear my head for a few moments when my own ambition get’s to overwhelming. Much like my university days, my bathroom prayers are for healing. But now instead of me asking for my guts to stop spilling, I ask only for momentary peace of mind. I ask for quiet. I ask for strength. My bathroom prayers are more sporadic these days. The universe has filled me with a calm that has kept me more level and now most of my prayers are done in reverence. Still, these bathroom prayers are etched in my body, tattooed in my soul, with scars that tear every so often. Bathroom prayers…Amen. C.R.Y with me…",2017
"Neurotic Erotica (Neurotica) Presents: Chest Thrustington in “Dude, you probably shouldn’t say that. Like, For real.” Part 1.","To his mind, the image before him was of such grandeur that using mere words to describe it could only lessen its splendor if not insult it outright. Her naked legs were a silken recital of romance and fantasy with prose that would drive him mad if his eyes were to linger on them too long. The length of her barely covered torso reminded him of an endless breadth of curved yet captivatingly smooth Saharan sand dunes with the twin symmetrical arches of her breasts on the horizon, distinctly perched upon her chest as if it were the last salvation you would need before you left this mortal coil. So enthralled was he with the enchanting framework she possessed that he failed to notice he lost his erection. She didn’t fail to notice, though. No, she noticed almost immediately and had worn the expression of confused annoyance for the last two minutes as they both stared at each other in silence. “Dude,” said the sultry goddess who could solve the Greek government-debt crisis using only a series of sexually suggestive hand motions. “What happened to your dick? It looks…somber? Melancholy? Fucking depressed?” She squinted her eyes as if she were concentrating on the image in front of her. “It looks like a sad Peyton Manning.” Chest Thrustington, broken from his trance, looked down towards his member and discovered that, undeniably, his manhood had indeed resembled the former Indianapolis Colts player, however, a deeply troubled and borderline suicidal version. “Well,” Chest Thrustington said with hollow confidence. “it’s sad because this room is about to turn into a crime scene.” He energetically twisted his hips from side to side with enough force to make his unenthusiastic package hit either side of his pelvis with a meaty thwack. “Cause I’m about to murder that vagina like Jon Benet, girl.” Chest said with more than a bit of desperation in his voice. Suddenly, the ethereal beauty with eyes so piercing it can actually make the metaphysical concept of your soul blush, looked slightly offended and somewhat embarrassed. “Pause.” She remarked. “Shit, sorry.” Chest said contritely. “Yeah.” The divine feminine before him added awkwardly. “I was saying it-like, I was speaking the words, and I was thinking to myself ‘there is no scenario in which this ends with me inside of you.’” He said “I agree. Dryer than sandpaper in the Sahara down here.” concurred the woman so beauteous she once ended a civil war in Tanzania just by agreeing to let the rebel leaders watch her eat a Subway Chicken Parmesan sandwich. “Is the mood-” He stammered “Fuck, is the mood, like, gone? Did I fuck it up? I fucked it up didn’t I?” He said with a tone as deflated as his flaccid staff. “Nah, I mean, yeah the whole dead kid thing kind of ‘drained the pool’ so to speak,” Said the subject for Beyonce’s inspiration board, using her fingers in air quotes, “but don’t worry. Just stay away from mentioning unsolved child murders while making unblinking eye contact with my vagina and we’re cool.” “Yeah?” Chest said hopefully. “Why not.” spoke the woman once described as “if Jesus and fresh cinnamon toast had a baby and that baby, in turn, had an orgasm.” Chest breathed a slight sigh of relief upon hearing her reassuring if somewhat cavalier statement. He closed his eyes as he straightened his posture and began thinking about one of the most cherished memories he refers to in times like these. That memory being the episode of Saved By the Bell where Kelly Kapowski had used Zack’s zit cream and underwent the hilarious consequence of having her entire face turn beet red due to a chemical reaction between her skin and the dubious components within the cream. Needless to say, he was harder than an Ikea desk assembly printout within seconds. “Now,” Chest Thrustington said with a renewed confidence. “I know I’ll never forget…” “We just talked about this…” grumbled the woman who either can, will, or has yet to be the centerpiece for every unspeakably depraved, uninhibited, and marginally sacrilegious fantasy your wife has ever had. “…how I flew this 747 of dick into your twin towers of- and your phone is out. You calling Uber? You’re calling Uber. Understood.” Chest said with matter of factly.",2017
Recess: Our First Discussion,"There are pivotal moments in our lives that force us to rewire. They are events that short-circuit the mechanics of our daily routines and make us re-assess the way we live, igniting a fire that we didn’t know we had or needed. And as we learned from ancient civilizations class or from the evacuation drills in school, fire can mean both the beginning of a new world and the destruction of all that we have carefully built. On Oct.20th our team hosted a discussion panel of four guest speakers who shared with an audience the negative events in their lives that forced them to deconstruct and rebuild. The panel took place in the new Lululemon Athletica community space and was the very first instalment of our Recess series, an ongoing programme of discussions and workshops that focus on mental health, learning new skills and creating safe, curious spaces. Despite it being a rainy Toronto evening, the turnout was incredible. For one of the speakers, the pivotal moment was a near-death experience. For another, a family tragedy. For a third it was a moment of pure existential panic, an epiphany of paralyzing fear while stuck in a crowded subway train — what some would call a severe anxiety attack. Every guest’s experience was unique but all served as catalysts for much-needed change. Through the adversity came newfound skills that allowed them to take a break from daily stress and embrace a platform that led to connection and self-care, whether it was through photography, yoga, or starting a charity dedicated to human rights. We were impressed by our speakers’ vulnerability but even more so by the reactions of the audience. Anxiety is so rarely spoken about yet we could see its prevalence in our community from the nods of affirmation; people could relate. One audience member even shared her own personal battle with anxiety. And as the discussion moved forward into tips for finding new passions, stillness, and mindful existence, the words of our panelist’s mental health specialist Kaajal resounded more than ever: there is no ‘cure’ for mental health issues, it’s a process. The Recess series is a means to capture that process.

Bell Let’s Talk,"I have mental illnesses, there I said it, and it shouldn’t change how you think about me, I am the same Emily I was 3 minutes ago before you read that sentence, if you liked me then, there’s no reason to not now. I have long struggled with depression, anxiety, OCD etc. it has been a long battle that is nowhere near over, but I get up everyday and continue that battle, whether you knew or not. I am telling you this because I think it is important for me to say, mental health initiatives strike close to home for me. I have read a lot of differing opinions on the Bell Let’s Talk day, and here is mine. I get it, I completely understand the people who look at the numbers and say “well 5 cents, that’s not very much for a company so big, they could more than that”. Yes they could, but they are giving something that will make a difference so it is start. The fact that bell has it’s brand all over it? That they will make money from this day, does that bother me as it bothers many people? No not really. And here is why the small amount of money and the branding doesn’t bother me. It is starting conversations, yes we need to talk about this more than once a day, we need to care more than one day, because mental illnesses last more than one day, but the fact that this movement is growing and reaching more people, starting conversations, or even just getting people thinking about it, that’s great. We need to talk about it, and if bell makes some money by getting the general public talking and donates some money while they’re at it, I think that is great. I want it to not be okay to make jokes about people with mental illnesses, I want the media to stop portraying mental illnesses as the cause for violence and terrorism, I want to be able to be honest with people without fearing judgment, or losing a friend. I want to be able to tell you on days when the demons in my head are winning, and not be called “crazy” or “attention seeking” or a “cliche”. The days when it’s hardest to be my friend are the days when I need you the most, but I don’t need you to move mountains, most of the time I need a hug, and I need you to remind me that even on the days when I can’t love myself, you still love me. And if that happens for people because bell made some extra money, then I think that is completely fine. Bell let’s talk may not end the stigma around mental illnesses today, or next year, but it starts conversations, and while that may sound like a small thing to many people, little victories aren’t little when they are yours. So I hope lots of people get their life changing “little” victories.",2017
Right Brain Touchpoint ~ What Stone Balancing Can Teach Us,"gravityglue.com You’ll really enjoy this. Watch Michael Grab (what a perfect last name for what he does) fine tune large rocks so that they balance on points. What we can learn from this is how it looks, acts, and feels to be in the Right Brain. Here are a few RB qualities you’ll see if you watch one of his videos: ~Slow time (are you getting impatient watching? That’s your Left Brain.) ~Sounds in nature (turn on your Right Brain just by listening to the water) ~Sensory interaction (touch and an inner intuitive sense to place the stones) ~Thinking inside an object (you thought empathy was just for people!) ~Dropping into the body (your Right Brain is for body awareness — can he really keep his hands that still?) ~Trust. (He knows that the stones might fall, but nervous anxiety would destroy his balance.) TOUCHPOINT QUESTIONS: How might you bring these qualities to bear on your work today? Can you see in the tasks on your plate an analogy to the stones? There is a hairline balance, a kind of beauty, that is possible to achieve. Even when the biggest, most dangerous “stone” must come last, as it hovers over the rest, how might you find this balance in your day today? Learn more at RightBrainSolutions.org",2017
2017 — a year to forget already?,"2017 did not start well for my family. No we weren’t in a car accident or didn’t make a bad financial decision. Instead, we lost a baby to miscarriage. We tried to conceive for the majority of last year and carried the little cherub for 3 months. I’m not telling you this to gain attention rather I think that miscarriage is not discussed openly enough and it is often these beginnings or rather endings of some form that lead to preventable Mental Health issues like anxiety, depression and isolation. The miscarriage was physically traumatic — I really thought I knew what happened but clearly didn’t until it was happening totally out of my control. The sadness pounds down on you like constant waves in a vicious storm.You still look and feel pregnant yet you aren’t. Statistics are read during late night googling or spouted by the doctor yet this fails to make your loss feel rational or understandable in any way. The intricate details of the pregnancy are like a scratched CD stuck on repeat, anxious thoughts bubbling over in your head “was it something I did? or something I didn’t do that I was supposed to?” “was I being punished for feeling sorry for myself over the New Year festivities period?” You can run yourself ragged with toxic thoughts that are both fruitless and untrue. You dread interaction with loved ones as you break the news, having to endure the sympathy because every time a condolence comes it confirms that the news really must be true…as you are still in shock and disbelief yourself. The loss is so heavy despite not having known the child personally yet, but dreams had already run wild and names shortlisted. And don’t think it just causes pain for the woman, it is particularly tough on the dad or partner involved, vitally as important to keep them talking and supported through this uncharted, devastating territory too. But as time passes, the light begins to seep through again and the possibilities of this life return. If you know anyone who has experienced loss of any kind, ask them this week how they are doing and how it feels of late. Specifically for miscarriage, you may like to get in touch with an organisation like Miscarriage Support or for a list of agencies that specialise in grief and bereavement, here is a list from the Citizens Advice Bureau. We need to keep checking up on our loved ones and listen for a while. And if you have been through something or feeling low at the moment, make sure you look up a local group (usually found on Facebook or Meetup) that can help you connect with people. I realise it may not be what you feel like doing but fake it until you feel it, humans just function better when being social. I did that myself yesterday by getting along to a local group called Blending the Motherload. I felt nervous about it, but it felt great once I was there- just being with other local mums who have all had their shares of trials and triumphs too.",2017

Why are So Many Teens and 20-Somethings Today Anxiety-Ridden?,"Last Thursday in my office I saw a strapping, healthy-looking 22-year old male who couldn’t attend school, get a job, or even look me in the eye because his social anxiety was so intense. I listened to a straight-A 18-year old who is taking a leave from college, even though she loves it, because her anxiety is keeping her from being able to focus on her work or attend class. And I saw a 16-year old who had been out of school for a year due to a wicked combination of social anxiety, sensitivity to loud noise, and a variety of anxiety influenced medical issues: headaches, fibromyalgia, and irritable bowel syndrome. I don’t know how it seems to be going in your home or the town or city you live in, but I am seeing an epidemic of anxious, stressed out teens, in my office and in my community. And I am not alone. There has been a significant increase in the number of teens and young adults with anxiety and depression in U.S. since the 1940’s. 25% of teens in the U.S. will fit the criteria for an anxiety disorder at some time, and anxiety is the most common mental disorder in adults, at 18% of the population (according to the NIH). The U.S. (and other Western countries) have a higher incidence of anxiety than the rest of the world, where the global prevalence of anxiety is only 7%. So U.S. teens and 20-somethings have become progressively more anxious over the last 60 years, are the most anxious age range in our society, and are more anxious than their peers in the rest of the world. What is going on in our culture and environment that is making our 21st century young people anxious? I think of our young people as the “canaries in the coal mines” of modern culture, with social, environmental, chemical, and community changes all coming to bear on their ability to function. No one knows exactly why teens are more anxious than they used to be, but I have a few guesses. In my book BodyWise, I write about the challenging mismatch between our physiology — which was designed for humans living thousands of years ago — and our culture and environment. And this is a more pronounced problem in Western countries than in more traditional cultures. Specifically, Western countries, like the U.S., have lost much of our communal connection. We often don’t even know our neighbors. The lack of religious and social community, the loss of family farms, and the increasing isolation of our nuclear families create environments which are less friendly to the happiness and relaxation of teens and adults alike. In the U.S., more social connections (at home, at work, in your softball league) lead to less depression and anxiety. Teens need social connections even more than adults, and not just through Instagram or Snapchat. Face to face interaction with friends reduces stress and fuels healthy development. My sister Lisa, who is a 30-year veteran educator who specializes in anxious teens, suggests that creating an environment in which young people can feel safe, form connections with other young people, and be successful, is the key to helping them recover their peace of mind. And if you’re the parent of the anxious teen, your love, support and connection is a critical factor in their success. No matter how your teen is behaving, he or she needs your attention, your presence and your affection, if they’re willing to receive it. Suggestion 1: Find an educational and social environment in which you (or your teen) feels safe and can be successful. Remember that “high achievement” is far less important for your young person’s success long-term, than feeling comfortable and confident in her or himself. As a parent, even when it’s tough, try to stay open to communication, attention and affection with your teen or 20-something. The impact of artificial lighting and technology on sleep is harsh for everyone in modern society, but it is particularly important for teens, who need more sleep than adults, but have shifted sleep clocks, meaning that they naturally go to sleep later and get up later (no news flash for those of you with teens in your home!). The issue is that most schools start by 8 am and teens can’t sleep in late, leaving them chronically sleep deprived. All artificial light has the result of reducing melatonin production at night and making sleep more difficult, but the light on computer and phone screens is a bluer light, and it has twice the suppressive effect on melatonin — severely impairing sleep in teens. A study published in the British Medical Journal reported that the more screen time teens engage in, the longer it takes them to fall asleep. Teens with 4 or more hours of screen time per day were 350% more likely to sleep less than 5 hours at night and 49% more likely to need more than 60 minutes to fall asleep. The impact of less sleep? Anxiety, depression, inability to concentrate and poor grades. Suggestion 2: Help yourself (or your teen) sleep by limiting screen time at night and/or adding an amber filter to their phone, pad, or laptop to limit blue light exposure (see justgetflux.com). For more help with getting yourself (or your teen) to sleep, see my article ’11 Tips for Getting to Sleep Tonight.’ All humans are physiologically designed to be active, and young people, at their physical peak, should be the most active at all. Exercise is my number one recommendation for preventing depression and is also effective in combating anxiety. In addition, exposure to nature is particularly therapeutic, reducing both anxiety and depression. Suggestion 3: Find any way for a young person to be active, preferably outside. Skateboarding, biking, walking to school, all sports, even fooling around outside — all count. Now seriously folks, I meet young people regularly who can’t cook, do dishes, drive, figure out a bus schedule, do their laundry, handle a bank account, or write a comprehensible letter or e-mail to an adult. This makes them incapable, vulnerable and dependent, and they know it. Which is why they’re stressed. Do they feel ready to be independent come the age of 18? Hell no. Which is a cause for anxiety and an impending “failure to launch” that hurts everyone. Our job is to raise adults, and to give them independence in every area that they’ve earned it, whenever possible. Let them fail at things while still at home so that they know how to figure out life when they leave home. A life-competent teen is a less anxious teen. And if you think that “tiger-parenting” a young person is a better option, in my opinion, excessively high parental expectations around school performance or college admissions is a major source of anxiety for many teens. Let them set their own expectations and establish an acceptable minimum for school performance — a B or C average, for example. They should be responsible for their future opportunities as much as possible. Suggestion 4: While living at home, require that your teen or young person care for their physical, nutritional, financial and transportation needs in whatever ways they are capable of. Give them independence to make decisions whenever it is safe to do so. And don’t pressure them to meet excessively high academic expectations — let them set their own goals for achievement, and then support them. Our brains were not built to withstand the amount of constant information that is barrages us. A study in Pediatrics of babies that were exposed to a DVD, showed significantly increased levels of the stress hormone cortisol, when compared to babies who played with blocks. And another study in Pediatrics showed that early television exposure significantly correlated with later diagnoses of ADHD. Fast forward to the small children I see in cars and airports all over the world with headsets and pads playing games and watching shows. What is the impact of all this stimulation? Well, increased stress hormones. And increased growth of the areas of the brain that respond to stress. Ultimately, a human with a lower threshold for stress and anxiety. Reducing screen time, as best you can, at all ages of development, is key to reducing anxiety. Most importantly, do your best to limit access to violent games, which increase both aggression and anxiety. Realize that kids who are on Facebook and other social media sites more hours, are more depressed and anxious. Perhaps comparing themselves to the “perfect” lives of their peers, falsely portrayed online. Some social media is fine, but require real face-to-face interaction to reduce anxiety and learn social skills. Suggestion 5: Limit your teen’s (or your own) access to and use of phones, pads and laptops when at home and require human interaction free of devices — at family dinner for example. 25% of U.S. residents eat at a fast food restaurant daily. And the food at those restaurants is processed, heavy with sugar and salt and highly inflammatory to the body and brain. A study in Tehran showed that the more processed food young adults consumed, the more likely they were to be anxious. Multiple studies have shown a reduction in the symptoms of ADHD, depression and anxiety when kids are fed a diet with lots of fruits and vegetables, essential fatty acids (in nuts and fish) and healthy protein. We are also exposed to over 50,000 chemicals in our environment, water and food supply that were not present merely 60 years ago (most of which have not been tested for human safety). A sampling of the umbilical cord blood of infants born in the U.S. revealed more than 200 industrial chemicals. Of the 297 chemicals detected, 180 cause cancer, 217 are toxic to the brain or nervous system, 208 cause birth defects. We have been conducting the biggest experiment on industrialized food and toxic exposure that has ever been seen in human history. And increased rates of learning disorders, depression and anxiety in our youth are likely consequences of this experiment. Suggestion 6: As best you can, keep your children and teens away from fast food and processed food. Only keep food and snacks at home that support their health: preferably organic fresh fruit, whole grain breads and crackers, nut butters and cheese, carrots and hummus. You’ll be amazed at how many healthy “snack foods” are available when you look for them. And avoid putting toxic herbicides and pesticides on your lawn or garden, which get tracked into the house or using toxic cleaning products. These are a few tips to get started in supporting yourself (if you’re a teen or young adult) or supporting a teen you love, with anxiety. Want more?

"On Dish Soap, Depression and Donald Trump","Nor am I usually so particular about the brand or scent of dish soap I use. I don’t normally spend an excessive amount of my time choosing such a mundane item at the store. But, then again, I’m not used to being so thrown off center. To find myself so completely altered and distracted and disheartened by the world around me, filled with all its “alternative facts” as it is, is somewhat new to me. And if not new, then at least I’ve never experienced it on this deep of a level before. Nevertheless, I recently found myself, standing there, staring blankly at a shelf containing a mere half dozen choices of higher-end dish soaps. Yes, I said dish soap. See, I somehow thought that if, rather than the cheap everyday stuff, I bought a moderately priced, lovely scented dish soap in a pretty French inspired bottle, my world, hell, maybe the entire world, might seem a little brighter. I picked up first one, then another, putting them each down in turn. Then, I’d return again to the earlier version. Take note of the scent, not even smelling it, just reading the name. Admire the label. Select another and begin the whole process all over again. I simply couldn’t make a decision; I was paralyzed. I’m definitely not new to the winter-time blues. No stranger really to even the post holiday doldrums. Over the years I’ve managed to expand my ups and downs to the other seasons of the year; a vast array of anxiety, depression, post traumatic stress, and even some minor OCD tendencies pepper my not so distant past. Don’t get me wrong, I’m a fairly intelligent, fiercely independent, liberal-minded woman. I’m absent of suicidal thoughts, marginally medicated, and I check in with a very effective counselor on a semi-regular basis. Still, I couldn’t seem to make that one simple, seemingly benign decision about which fucking dish soap to buy. I stood there, maniacally picking up and turning over, before placing bottle after bottle back on the shelf. At one point a lady approached and commented on what a wonderful selection they had, referring to the organic line of household cleaners the store carried. She appeared to be a fellow shopper. However, I’m not entirely convinced she wasn’t part of the store’s undercover theft prevention personnel, sent out to determine whether the suspicious woman in aisle eight was trying to shoplift cleaning supplies. Add paranoia to my list of tendencies. All because I couldn’t bring myself to make a decision. In my quite possibly rational way of thinking, I’d led myself to believe that if I could pick just the right one, things would be better. That I could find some shred of enjoyment in a banal task if I had a fancy bottle or a pleasant scent to distract me. I’m not saying I consciously thought that at the time, but rather, in my current state, my mind, my heart, my hope for something brighter inherently clung to something I had some control over. And over the past few days I’ve sort of been asking myself, Why? I’m sure a lot of us have been asking ourselves the very same thing. Why? Why? Why? Or, in the alternative, How? How is this all happening? Is this really happening? The only formative explanation I can come up with is found in the world around me. Or perhaps my reaction to that world. A lot has been going on that I never thought I would see in this day and age. There’s talk of censorship, of exclusion, of threats to beliefs that are at the very heart of this great nation and the democracy in which it was founded. And not just idle talk, it appears, but actions being taken or at least in process. And it’s scary. It’s terrifying, this shit show. Let me be perfectly clear: I do not place all of my hang-ups on our nation’s new leader. But I can’t help but think I’m not the only one who’s suffering some anxiety and depression over this, and maybe you, too, have noticed that it’s a little (or a lot) more pronounced. If so, you’re not alone. Wait! See that little heart at the bottom there? If you enjoyed this piece, please click on it so I know it and so others might see it, too. Thanks!

“My work-life balance has improved dramatically!”,"A Testimonial Managing timeframes and deadlines can be challenging if you have dyslexia. Marcia Fox works in healthcare. In 2015 she was referred to Lexxic for a dyslexia diagnostic assessment following changes to working practices which put a strain on her time. Marcia was found to have dyslexia. We caught up with her at the end of last year to see how she was getting on following the assessment. It was because of changes in my work schedule. I had been having difficulties coping with timeframes for appointments and I had been doing extra work in my own time. Before the Lexxic assessment, timescales had been reduced further so that it became too hard for me to do the work, even using my own time. I seemed to manage using coping strategies of my own until then, but appointment times were reduced and it was the time factor that changed things — I couldn’t cope with the limited time to complete tasks without support. I’ve always taken longer than others, but dyslexia didn’t seem to exist when I was at school. I had been working long hours, but this was taking its toll. I was working at least an extra 2 hours per day above my usual 8-hour day. I was always aware that I had to check my work more and this was time consuming. I used to print everything out to check it and I used my finger to track a line of text to keep my place. My memory is bad so I leave post-it notes everywhere and write stuff down. I appear to others to be very organised, but I have to work hard to compensate for the difficulties. I always prefer to speak to people rather than write things down — it’s much easier for me to talk and I always try to do that. I was very anxious, as I wasn’t sure what the outcome would be. I was not sure how I would feel about getting a ‘label’ like dyslexia. But, the alternative was to look for another job as I did not feel I’d be able to continue doing my current job with the implementation of reduced timescales. I was already working 2 hours extra per day, and though I was willing to work more hours, even with all my strategies, I could not cope with the reduced timescales. All my strategies that worked well for me before would not work with the additional time reduction. The Assessor was lovely and supportive throughout. However, I found the tasks very traumatic as they highlighted to me how significant my problems were - Like reading a passage of text aloud. I always try to avoid doing this, so having to read aloud was not enjoyable and made me realise how much I struggle. I cried on the way home. However, I understood the assessment needed to be done so I wanted to continue. I knew how important it was to get confirmation so I could move on one way or the other. This kept me going during the assessment, so that I could find a solution. I was really upset initially as I found it so difficult. I had no idea how hard it would be. I thought I had done so badly and this is what upset me the most. I wish I had made the decision to get assessed earlier. I’ve done higher education, and I studied for my degree a long time ago — if I had known then and had the support in place then life and my studies would have been so much easier. I wish I hadn’t dug my head in the sand for so long. Personally, it was the relief! It has given me an explanation for my difficulties, I’m not ‘stupid’ after all! It was so refreshing to find out and I thought, “Great, I can solve this now!” Initially it was fantastic. Very soon after, once the report was provided to my employer, I discussed the recommendations made by Lexxic as a result of the assessment with my manager, who agreed to put all the recommendations in place. The time factor has made a huge difference — I was recommended additional time to complete tasks. My workload has been adjusted and I now get 25% extra time for completing appointments. The pressure that took off was phenomenal! I could not believe how much of a difference that made. In addition, they provided text to speech software, which is amazing! The coloured overlays, reading rulers and changing the background colour of my screen also really helped me a lot. It’s had a big impact on my health. I’m not so anxious and stressed anymore. I am so much more relaxed and I’m not trying to rush so much. My work-life balance has improved dramatically! I switch off and stop work at the right time and that’s me finished, rather than stressing about when I’m going to do stuff. My friends have noticed a positive impact too. My manager commented that she has noticed a big difference in how relaxed I seem now. Don’t give it a second thought! Reach out and get the help as it’s phenomenal! It will make a huge difference in both your working life and personal life. A big thank you to Lexxic and my employer for being so supportive! I honestly never thought the outcome would be so positive. I really appreciate the support. I tell people about my dyslexia now in the hope it will inspire others to get the support they need.

Living with Agoraphobia,"I had never seen an illustration of agoraphobia this accurate and relatable. Hence, I though of sharing this to raise some awareness. The illustration credit goes to Gemma Correll (http://www.gemmacorrell.com/my-sketchbook/attachment/agora/) People underestimate how helpless one feels when undergoing a such panic attack. The worst I’ve ever experienced was once when I was midst of work and came out to run some errands, it was a sudden change of environments and I was by my self. It is not a feeling that one can put into words. I didn’t know what to do. All I thought was that next second I’ll be flat on the ground. My heart was racing, hands were shivering and my mouth was dry. Imagine the most helpless you’ve ever felt while being surrounded by so many people and having to experience it very often. Ignoring the whole environment and using my phone has always been my coping mechanism. This time it didn’t work either. I didn’t know how to go back to my office. I couldn’t raise my feet. Imagine for few seconds being abducted by aliens and you have absolutely no idea what to do next. You whole brain goes numb and all it thinks is that you are going to fall into grounds. Worse part is that it has never happened and you have to live with the uncertainty of when will it actually happen. My mother, sister and my boyfriend are the once who are aware of my condition. I honestly felt like asking one of them to come get me despite being in the middle of work. In the worst situations, I call either (mostly) my mother or my boyfriend and ask them to be online so that I don’t feel lonely and even if I lose control I know someone is there to call for help. I dialled my mother and when I tell her “I’m feeling it again”, she knows exactly how to react. She wouldn’t question anything, she would just casually start a conversation with me distract me from the situation. It has always worked on me. I completed the task I came for, went back to the office washroom sat on the commode and started contemplating every single detail to make me feel that I’m actually “right here, right now”. That is exactly when I wanna break down and cry. I feel exhausted, why do I have to live with this, what am I doing wrong. Having first hand experience in Agoraphobia and having studied psychology, I know anxiety and panic attacks are not a decision to be made. So stop saying “get over it” and “it’s all in your head”, if we could what makes you think that we’d choose to live with it? The best you can do is, believe he/she and talk with them casually to distract them from the whole situation, hold his/her hand, make them feel that even if they fall you’d be there to catch them and call for help. Constantly questioning about the situation, humiliating and advising is the worst you could do in a such situation.",2017
I Have My Permission,"Anxiety is like, the herpes of mental illness. Ok, maybe not like herpes in the sense that there are open sores and a night of sexual friskiness I will forever regret. But anxiety sticks around, forever until you die. There is no endgame with anxiety. There is no magic pill or silver bullet solution. With that said, I still thought that I would be able to beat anxiety, because I never learn and sometimes I’m kind of dumb. Even though my counselor told me that it would be with me for life, that I would feel uncomfortable for a long time until my new habits become normal and even then, I will still have this anxiety it’s like I forget all that. I jump right back to trying to find the magic thought process that will end my anxiety. Sometimes its like what she says goes in one ear and out the other, because sometimes I just don’t want this to be a thing anymore and I just want it to go away. Either that or I’m a human goldfish…or I treat her advice like it’s the silence in Doctor Who, and once I leave her office I just forget everything. As I go through the process of managing my anxiety, there are things that I’m learning about myself that I didn’t realize before. This is something that I would like to share in list form because Cracked is my format of choice, apparently: I freak out about a lot of things, as one with anxiety does. It has gotten worse with age, it physically hurts sometimes. In my bones, and I wish that was hyperbole. So when I’m told things like: “Just stop thinking about it” It shorts my brain a little. The reason why is because that is the whole kit and caboodle right there. I can’t stop obsessing over a new thing I’m freaking out about, not at the snap of a finger anyway. It is a slow process of steps that I have to take, that I’m still a novice at. So, I may obsess over a thought for a while, freak out over a feeling for a time. Those words can also put pressure on me too because then I start worrying like, why can’t I just stop thinking about whatever it is I’m thinking about? Then off I go, getting impatient and upset about why I can’t just stop thinking about things that make me upset. It isn’t until recently (like this morning) that I’m starting to just have more patience with myself and my process. Which leads me to my next thing. 2. I don’t make the best decisions. I recently had a friend tell me that my feelings, and associated actions surrounding my feelings were a choice, a conscious decision that I was making at that time. In a way, she was right. That particular weekend, I decided that I would just be sad due to mental exhaustion from a work situation that triggered an anxious episode. In a way, it hurt a little bit because I so badly would like to choose the “right” option. I would like to have the sad and anxious feelings, but be able to keep it moving. There are a lot of times where I’m able to, but there are those times that I’m not. Normally, when I stop doing the things I love doing because I’m wasting energy constantly freaking out about something, it would cause another freak out about how I’m wasting my life away and when I’m on my deathbed I’ll regret all the things I didn’t do like write or knit…then I’ll go back to worrying about being sick or losing my job, and then back to freaking out about wasting my life away, and so on and so on. But this time? I don’t know if I moped more constructively, or if my counselor’s suggestion to take time off without judging myself hit home, or if it was this book, Constructive Wallowing by Tina Gilbertson that is helping me out, but something happened. After that weekend, I started writing this essay. I started researching writing tips, and picked up a knitting project that I had let fall by the wayside. Is that how moping is supposed to go? Because if so, I may try that again against my better judgment and past experiences. 3. Nope, I’m not going to take medication This one is a weird one because I am not slamming medication. If a person and their doctor have come to the conclusion that medication will help, then so be it and I fully support it. However, I nor my counselor feel that medications are what I need. We seem to be the only two people who feel this way as I have had about three or four people ask me five times if I haven’t considered medication. It took me about six years to finally quit smoking. I failed a lot, and so hard. I would quit and then two hours later, light up again. I smoked with the patch on. I smoked after chemotherapy. I know that it looked like I would never quit. I thought I was going to die from smoking, and it would freak me out. I would put the cigarette in my mouth, light it, look at the smoke come off of it and think, “Holy shit. I’m really going to die from this. I’m really slowly killing myself right now”, and then inhale. But then one day, I just stopped. I really don’t know if it was the smoking induced nausea, or the fact that I started counseling around that time, but something clicked and now all I know is that if all the cigarettes on the Earth were destroyed, it wouldn’t bother me. By the way, I can’t even believe that I can write that sentence and mean it because I failed so hard for so long at quitting smoking. Like, I mean I epic failed at quitting. It was so bad. Back to my point. Managing anxiety is like quitting smoking for me. I have to adjust to a major change in my life. I have to understand that I can get through life without being constantly afraid of it. I can let my “negative” emotions linger, but I can’t let them drive me and I have to let them pass. However, I’m too afraid to fully embrace the coping mechanisms I am learning. I can’t understand what to do with the energy I gain from feeling ok, or how to embrace feeling ok. Medication is not going to help me do that either. Here is why I feel this way. I saw a stand up special on Netflix called 3 Mics, by Neal Brennan. In it he talked about how he took medication for his Depression, and he describes how those pills shut down other feelings too. Like, they worked a little too good. This isn’t just one guy, I have looked up other people on YouTube and on Buzzfeed videos, and found that taking medication is a mixed bag. I realized that I had to look at myself, and honestly assess if medication would help me out specifically. I realized that no, it would not. Unfortunately, I have relied on anxiety as my coping mechanism to get me through 33 years of life. That’s over three decades. I’m not going to be able to turn that around in one year. Or two years. Or even three. Well, maybe the people who go to Tony Robbins seminars can turn their lives around on a dime, but I am not among them. This is going to be a long process, one that I am seeing benefits from, even if others don’t just yet. I can feel the seedling working beneath the soil. I just have to be patient with myself and the process. That’s it. This is where I’m at right now. I am super uncomfortable and don’t really know what I’m doing, but I’ll eventually figure it out. That is the one thing that I know, is that I’ll figure it out. This blog was so hard to write but, I needed to write this out for myself. I needed to see these feelings I have in my mind on a page, and give myself permission to go down my road however I need to. Are you in this same space? You will be alright, and I will too because we have no other choice.",2017
Relaxation with Anxiety.,"Hello everyone! If you’ve been reading my blog for a while, or if you have read the majority of titles of my blog posts, you will know that I struggle with Anxiety. It’s been hard for me to cope with my anxiety a lot more this year. I try to keep it away from Adam as I know it is hard to listen to all the irrational feelings and worries. In October I had a bit of a melt down with my anxiety and I was crying every night before bed and also on the days where Adam and I could chill and do Uni work together, it was always disturbed by me crying. I started to get Adam down, he was struggling with liking his new university course and then when he got home he would listen to me cry overnight (just to be clear, every night he was doing his best to console me, he wasn’t just sitting, playing on his xbox while I was crying beside him) Adam went home on one of the weekends, back to Reading, while I stayed in Farnham. We had a little chat through text where he explained that it gets hard to help me when he is feeling low himself. I never expected Adam to help me, as lovely as it is to have someone by your side cuddling you and wiping away the tears; sometimes you need to just have an ugly cry to yourself…snot bubbling and mascara dripping down into your cleavage (we’ve all been there, right?) Living with Adam has honestly been one of the best things I’ve done. We never argue and we are so chilled in each others company. He’s my best friend and I really look forward to coming home after University and seeing his cute little face. Before we lived together, Adam commuted to Uni from his home in Reading, while I lived in Student Accommodation. I kept myself to myself back then. I lived with some really nice people but I began to get too anxious to want to hang out with them. It got to the stage where if I had a shitty day, I would cuddle up to my stuffed pig and cry. If I felt anxious, I would go home and cry. If I felt anything but happy a good cry would get it all over and done with and then I would feel alright again. Living with Adam made me stronger when fighting my anxiety. I try my hardest every week to not let it get to me as much. Sure, sometimes when the light is off and we’ve said our good-nights I might go to the toilet to sob a bit, or I will roll over in bed and a few tears would creep out but I dont ugly-cry as much and I don’t cry anywhere near as often! Trying to push my anxiety down and learn to release it in other ways instead of crying made it finally became obvious to me that beforehand I wasn’t fully trying to help myself get out of the anxiety-full slum that I had been in for the past few weeks. I wasn’t fighting…as soon as I got upset or anxious, I would just cry, and cry and cry. I didn’t stop to think how this was affecting those around me, especially how hard it would be for Adam to have to deal with this day in and day out. To help me stop feeling so incredibly anxious, I began to not care so much about Uni work. This started to help me relax. I am a grade chaser. I chase grades to the extent that I will stay up till 2 or 3am every night to get my work done to the best it can be; then I will wake up at 8 and continue doing work till the same time as the previous night…all the while I would be stressing out that I still haven’t achieved enough work to be an ‘A’ grade. I made a rule that I could not start work before 10am and I wouldn’t be able to do work after 10pm, no matter what else I had done in the day. If I went on a day out from 9am till 7pm then I could only work for 3 hours, and learn to deal with it. This made me organise my day (Which I LOVE doing anyway! If any of you are the same as me, I highly recommend buying a Passion Planner!) http://www.passionplanner.com By feeling that I had more time in the day to relax, my anxiety never reached high on my ‘cry-worthy’ chart. This year, I came into the year feeling quite good about uni. We were done with Film and now it was purely Photography. When my little breakdown in October came around, I began to feel more distant from the class. I have found it difficult to find my voice in lessons and I’ve felt really anxious speaking to anyone. I have remained in contact with one of my favourite people, Sophie. She’s in this vlog here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfgPjvZcpiA&t=356s Meeting up with Sophie is like the biggest breath of fresh air. I feel like we totally understand each other and we have things like anxiety, and the love of cats, LUSH COSMETICS and photography in common. Of course amongst other things too! I don’t feel anxious around Sophie, when we went to London (In the vlog linked above) I was initally thinking “aaaah CROWDS!” But within about 30 mins to an hour I had completely left that feeling behind. It’s so nice to not feel like the world is caving in. I would completely recommend that if you struggle with anxiety too…first of all, Hello! I hope you’re ok! Meeting up with someone, just one person can completely change your outlook and most likely sidetrack your mind. ps. Hello Sophie if you’re reading :) I think we should have a Costa-Catch-up soon! :) If you are being a bit more anxious than usual and you don’t really know where your thoughts lie, I 100% recommend the ‘Namaste’ app on the app store. It asks you the same questions every day you go onto the app but it makes you really think about what is making you anxious and then gives you an opportunity to write down what you’re looking forward to. I don’t use it all the time but it is a very soothing app. (I purchased it for 79p) Where would I be without LUSH? For anyone who has no idea what I’m talking about here, Lush is the holy grail of baths. Lush is life. Literally. Every 4 months(ish) I spend about £30-£40 in Lush. (15–20 bath products) Baths are so so soothing and with the scents of Lush products… I can sit in a Lush bath for more than an hour. It is pure heaven. My favourite bath bomb is the Frozen Bath bomb. It smells GLORIOUS! My next favourite is the Intergalactic Bath bomb. Adam loves this one too so I can normally lure him in the bath with that one :) I would completely spur you on to delve into the Lush website. (Make sure you have money in your account first! Trust me, you’ll definitely want to buy something!) uk.lush.com Another thing that I enjoy doing if I need to relax with my anxiety is film a Youtube video. You may think that filming a video for however many people might make me more anxious, but it is something that I really REALLY enjoy doing! I don’t upload toooo often just because I have a hella amount of work at Uni but every now and then I love to film something! My favourite to film is vlogs. I love creating memories to look back on and they are always going to be there on a rainy day. www.youtube.com I also love watching Youtube videos. I love watching makeup and skincare based videos, they are great but not so great for my bank account (whoops!) At the moment, I love watching, Gabriella Lindley, Fabulous Han, Zoella, Thatcher Joe (especially his gaming channel; it’s hilarious). If you like ‘The Sims 4’, Zoella and Alfie do a Sims series (which are really fun to watch, if you are a complete sims lover like myself!) It’s on Alfies gaming channel which is ‘Pointlessbloggames’. Lastly, one thing that I can never say no to when I feel anxious is a cuddle from Adam. I lift his arm up and put my head on his chest. There’s something so soothing about listening to his heart beat. I normally end up falling asleep pretty quickly when I lay on him, so my anxiety completely disappears for that while. I also sandwich my cuddly penguin between us too. His name is Popper and I literally cannot sleep without cuddling him. No matter how old you are, you can’t beat a cuddly penguin!! Im 21 and proud :) He smells slightly of lavender and he makes me so sleepy! If any of you struggle with anxiety, I really hope some of my relaxation techniques help you too! We are all in this together, noone should be trekking through this alone! I hope you have a lovely day and week! I will see you shortly! Love, Rosie xxx note: All opinions are my own.

#BellLetsTalk — An Anxiety Overview,"Some mornings I wake up to my cat literally punching me in the mouth as a sort of siren song towards the empty food bowl. Those are the good days: I feed the furry kings, eat and make coffee, and then do whatever it is I need to do. Other days are not so good: on the bad days, I wake up to a wall of ten thousand bees all buzzing at me. Not only is the buzzing increasingly loud and angry, it’s also accompanied by ten thousand versions of my own voice (and also sometimes my mother’s, and former boyfriends or friends or employers), all shouting out the various reasons I suck and should stay in bed. Oh, but the bees are also revving chainsaws for some reason. On those mornings, I still get up and do things, but later — sometimes, unfortunately, the only response is to grab the other cat (the one that isn’t punching me) and roll over and sleep more. It’s easier to coma out than it is to deal with reality on those mornings. Here’s the answer to the question: what’s wrong with you? Well, many things. I’m glad you asked. In this case, the problem tends to be a saucy and heady mix of Anxiety and Seasonal Affective Disorder, along with slight dabbles of PTSD. It’s been around for as long as I can remember — I was a little kid from a really unhappy and sometimes violent home, and in those situations, you learn to always be on your guard. Recently my sibling and I realized that we both monitor is approaching based on the way their footsteps fall behind us — a skill that proved useful when hoping to avoid an angry parent’s wrath. In those situations, you always sleep with one eye open, and you never feel entirely safe. This is one way anxiety develops — the way my doctor explained it is that your chemicals get really used to being high strung all the time. Think of a deer with a constant set of headlights following it around. Then, when the cause of stress eventually leaves, it feels so normal to have those chemicals at that high level that your body is hesitant to take them back down. Or, when a situation that would be marginally stressful to a well-adjusted person shows up, your body gets so excited to return to those old familiar stressed-out stomping grounds that it dials your chemicals up 200% for fun — in this case, picture that guy in your high school who had a shitty car with a massive speaker setup who would crank them up as loud as rock concert even when he was driving to the gas station. When your system is built for the maximum, it is hard to convince it to go softly. For a long time, I was really angry, all of the time — I shouted at people, places, and things like some really traumatized version of a See Spot Run book. “What’s Jane doing over there? She’s screaming into the void, and also at her high school principal. See Jane scream!” And I drank like it was water or oxygen. And drinking all the time was only making it worse, too: it turns out that the reason alcohol makes us feel uninhibited up until a certain point is because it uses up a chemical in our brains that makes us relaxed and happy — so the next day, you feel like crap, because you literally used up all your happy points for the next day. With drinking, it got to the point where I realized that I was doing it because I liked that when I was drunk enough, I could finally admit to myself how much I hated myself. And right after that, I would be drunk enough that maybe I would finally not wake up, which was what I secretly wanted. But at some point, I got enough friends and hobbies that I enjoyed that I realized that if I was dead, I couldn’t do the hobbies I enjoyed or spend time with the people I care about. Basically I realized that I was burning myself out. It turns out that it takes a lot of energy to be constantly amped up and ready to pounce on the people around you for perceived mistakes. I have to give credit to guys in Tap-Out shirts, it takes a lot of energy to be that pissed off all the time. And one day, I realized that I was over it. I couldn’t spend all that time with a chip on my shoulder. I like eating chips, not using them as epaulettes. I couldn’t spend the rest of my life looking like a Frito-Lays’ women’s powersuit in the 90s. I’m not saying it was easy, but one day I wasn’t angry at the entirety of the world anymore. In fact, I quite liked the world, and wanted to spend time with it. But where the anger had been was a giant well of deep-seated anxiety — it turns out the anger had been Mary McFly’s high school bully Biff. Lots of bravado with a lot of sad down at the bottom. Anger had been useful because it was a way to blame the outside world for my own problems. But when you carve it away, the problem was what it had always been, a total fear of the world around me, calling itself “Anxiety” (along with a big bad tendency to get really, really sad in the winter). So with that has come a whole host of other problems. I obsessively overthink interactions with the people around me, I have a chronic inability to sleep through the night, I severely procrastinate until the last minute because I am paralyzed by the possibility of making a mistake. OH, also panic attacks, where one minute you are sailing along and overthinking one thing to avoid dealing with your emotions, then all of a sudden all you can think of are hundreds of swirling knives and also your mother’s screaming face in close up, and also ten thousand rottweilers gnarling at your legs, which is sad because like you they could have been sweet affectionate animals if only they had had a normal upbringing full of care and tenderness. And it lasts for somewhere from twenty minutes to hours. Once I literally thought I was having a heart attack, and made it up the stairs to my roommate’s room, where she told me I needed to breathe. (She was coincidentally listening to music of the ocean and had like twenty candles burning in her room, which was very helpful.) She made me touch her heart and breathe and hug my cat, and told me that I didn’t need the ambulance. I told her that if this was some of her hippy bullshit I would return and haunt the hell out of her. But I was ultimately fine. Such is the power of the mind and the imagination. It’s not like I’m alone, either. When I started telling my friends about my lack of grip on my own sanity, many of them confessed that they had also had panic attacks. A friend of mine said that when school stresses got to be too much, he could hear thousands of people yelling — in an empty room. But when these attacks happen, you are entirely convinced that what’s occurring is real. And it is real, but the person who is screaming is your own mind, tired of being ignored. A different friend said similar things about getting panic attacks managing a coffee shop. Our current world is a cesspool of factors that exacerbate anxiety — our generation is overeducated, underexcercised, underemployed, and oversaturated with information. Some scientists from the University of Illinois did a study that pointed to cellphones causing anxiety and depression. The idea behind it is that, basically, we need time to process information. But since we’re too quick to bury our heads in our phones as a quick way to avoid reality, we miss out on important time needed to reflect on the course of the day. If we don’t get that time, we quickly become overloaded with information and our bodies and minds become overwhelmed. So the answer to that is, unfortunately, very simple. Spend time alone and spend time with your friends. But when you are alone, be alone — don’t bring your phone into it, you need the time to process. And when you are with your friends, actually BE with your friends. It’s as easy and as hard as that. In some ways, it’s great to hide from the world in your phone, and I get it — I do it all the time. But it doesn’t promote emotional resilience. In fact, it makes us less resilient — the key to being better at handling things is to have more experiences that bring us joy and vulnerability and laughter, and to be fully immersed in them. It makes you better at actually dealing with sad things. Think of being able to handle leaping from the hot tub into a snowpile in the winter — it only works if you’ve been warm! And anxiety what happens when you stand around outside of the hot tub because you’re afraid of the heat, and then get thrown into the snowbank anyways. It’s no fun and you’re colder than you would’ve been. For me, anxiety and the associated horror are all a learning curve, but it’s getting easier. It’s about really listening to yourself, and being unafraid to talk to people who care about you about your struggles. As the running monkey in Bojack Horseman says, “Every day it gets a little easier. But you have to do it every day. That’s the hard part. But it does get easier.” We are often little kids at bedtime asking for someone, anyone, to tell us if the monsters are real. Our parents tell us, over and over that they aren’t — and this is the wrong approach, because in a child’s mind, the fearful metaphor is the most real thing there is. If you tell a child a monster isn’t real, then in their mind, not only is the monster still real, you have now told them that they have to face its fangs and whorling bloody talons on their own. I don’t know the solution, but I do know one thing — In my wooden-sworded flailings against my own personal demons, the most helpful friends and companions I have found are those who can help me understand it. Sit with me as I watch it from afar for weeks, days, noticing the ways it moves, it breathes. We chat and laugh as I carefully throw breadcrumbs to the beast, it snarling at first, but eventually lapping them up hungrily. Tell me to drop the sword in the snow and approach slowly, cautiously edging foot after foot into the crunching drifts. Its eyes grow wide, and you realize they’re the same colour as your own. Laugh encouragingly as its nostrils flare hot air into the cold around it, and I begin to talk to it — and eventually, it rolls over, and shows me its soft belly, no longer fearsome, just in need of a soft touch.",2017
OCD — A Personal Battle,"The first time I remember recognizing something was wrong I was nine-years-old. My family had recently moved to a suburb of New York City, quite the change from the small town of Yakima, WA where I was born and spent nearly every prior moment of my existence on earth. Upon returning home from my new grade school (3rd grade I believe) I felt compelled to go straight to the garage, board my bicycle and ride down the street to the cul-de-sac, around a specific drain cover, before entering the house to greet my family. At the time I didn’t notice the pull to complete that ride as a symptom of anything grander, just a minimally frustrating anxiety, a mental itch that could only be scratched by that simple, yet life-changing ritual. The benefit I soon learned, from that apparently innocent routine, was a release from the grips of anxiety, of fear and doom, a heaviness without a face and without definition that began to invade. Regardless of how short-lived and fleeting this respite was, it was worth it, if only for that brief moment. To not feel some imaginary fate of the world on my shoulders for a few minutes until the next compulsion beckoned and demanded payment. From that first routine, much more would sprout. Most less fun, more controlling and more debilitating. The routines I learned 10-years after they started were likely the compulsion part of the hideous Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (aka OCD). This isn’t the cute, quirky “disorder” you see on the sit-coms when describing an eccentric yet whimsical characters’ need for order in their apartment or the one your friend uses to describe themselves when it comes to not wanting you to eat french fries in their car. “Sorry, just my OCD”, cue shoulder shrug, coy smile and audience laugh. This is a full-fledged, life sucking, mind control of anxiety and dread that can only be tamed in short spurts of life sucking and potentially hilarious (from an outsiders view) rituals of seemingly zero importance and even less utility. WebMD defines obsessive-compulsive disorder as “a potentially disabling illness that traps people in endless cycles of repetitive thoughts and behaviors. People with OCD are plagued by recurring and distressing thoughts, fears, or images (obsessions) they cannot control. The anxiety (nervousness) produced by these thoughts leads to an urgent need to perform certain rituals or routines (compulsions). The compulsive rituals are performed in an attempt to prevent the obsessive thoughts or make them go away. Although the ritual may temporarily alleviate anxiety, the person must perform the ritual again when the obsessive thoughts return. This OCD cycle can progress to the point of taking up hours of the person’s day and significantly interfering with normal activities. People with OCD may be aware that their obsessions and compulsions are senseless or unrealistic, but they cannot stop them.” The National Institute of Mental Health estimates that about 1% of the U.S. adult population deals with some form of obsessive-compulsive disorder, and about 50% of those cases would be considered severe, experienced by 0.5% of the population or 1.1 million people in the U.S, with 25% of those cases developing by age 14. My early years of battling with this would have tended toward the latter part of the definition above….severe. The routines experienced ranged greatly. Really whatever my mind would grab on to at the time to relinquish control. A few that stand out are, daily taking an hour or more to get up the stairs in our home, having to step on each stair step an equal amount with both feet and consistent on every stair. I dreaded having to go upstairs to my room for any reason, knowing it could take an hour to get there, depending on the intensity that day. Others included spending an hour or more straightening the fringes on the living room rug when no one was around to judge my (in)sanity of course so that each fringe was equidistant and parallel to the others. Or checking the door locks 5, 10 or more times before bed, in a specific order, with specific rules that once broken, required the routine to begin again from the beginning. However, no routine was more frustrating than that of the dreaded, daily, nighttime, pre-bed ritual. Upon turning the water off after brushing my teeth, from that moment on every move had to be exact. The number of steps out of the bathroom to my bedroom door. The way I stepped over the bedroom threshold and finally the exact number of steps to my bed. However, as anybody that has experienced OCD can attest, perfection in your routines, your compulsions, is illusory, almost unattainable. Even when I got the steps just right, lying in bed I would think about the various items on my dresser and shelves not being equidistant from each other, potentially not parallel to the edge of the structure displaying them. As such, I would rise and inspect, straighten if needed, touch each item with the same amount of fingers from each hand, an even number only, to ensure complete symmetry. Because the perfect entry to bed was interrupted by the other ritual, I would be forced to start the pre-bed routine again. Often resulting in me finally attempting to sleep 2–3 hours after I first got into bed….and this happened EVERY EXHAUSTING NIGHT. I generally would perform these same rituals daily, for hours, trying as much as possible to insulate the rest of my family from them, embarrassed by what outwardly made no sense and seemed completely irrational, but internally, was absolutely necessary. The only way to hold the fragile world together. That everyone I loved and the life I knew, was fully dependent on my execution of these rituals perfectly and without blame. Able to hide 90% of it, my family didn’t know for years and most likely still don’t know the extent of it. Even my closest friends never knew and even today, I assume much of the content of this article comes as a surprise to those closest to me. I’ve always found it challenging to articulate the battles going on in my mind, as illogical and irrational as they are. How do you explain them? After 4–5 years of battling with whatever “this” was, I broke down one evening and shared with my parents. Unable to absorb the heaviness of it anymore, I needed help carrying the burden. It was at that stage the intensity of the obsessions and compulsions began to lessen, as often happens when truth is spoken and not left to fester in silence and embarrassment. We didn’t have a name for it, just what seemed to be some irrational thinking. Randy’s eccentricities. In fact, it wasn’t really until my mid-30’s, after experiencing a pretty scary anxiety attack that took me to the emergency room, that I shared with my primary physician and had validated what I knew for 20 years. That I suffered from OCD and potentially general anxiety disorders. This year I turned 40, and have now officially lived with a challenging level of clinical obsessive-compulsive disorder for 31 years. Where has the time gone! Currently, my OCD is something I am treating with a mixture of exercise, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI’s), prayer, mindfulness, and pursuing my faith and studying what I believe to be the eternal truths of the Bible, seeking peace, gratitude, and acceptance in life. I recognize how many times many of the men and women in the Bible discuss the fears of life, the desire for some semblance of control, regardless of how fictitious, while constantly being chastened and reminded that God is ultimately in control. I was once just an awkward teenager made more awkward with OCD rituals. Now I’m a slightly less awkward adult….trying to avoid stepping on sidewalk cracks while walking with my pregnant wife and son in downtown Seattle…not because I’m pretending with my two-year-old its lava, but because my irrational mind tells me that if I step on the cracks, any bad things that happen are my responsibility and could have been avoided if I had just minded those cracks. Come to think of it, in many ways to the outside observer I’m probably more awkward. A kid purposefully stepping over cracks in a sidewalk or flicking the lights on and off 8 times is cute, an adult purposefully avoiding cracks or ritualistically turning the lights off and on to settle into a room is just plain annoying….and weird! Unfortunately, the last couple years much of the intensity of the OCD has returned. I’m not sure if there is a correlation with the additional responsibilities and significant people in my life; marriage, our first born and the second on the way. At the same time the growth of our family business, adding employees I care deeply about, and their families. Frankly, I’m still hypothesizing what may have brought it on in the first place or what magnifies it during certain times of my life and what causes it to shrink during others. Maybe if I did I could avoid certain situations like the recovering addict avoids the beer isle. I could exist with less of it. I know some cognitive behavioral therapy would prove helpful if I would just finally pursue it. Roughly 1 in 100 people in the United States battle with obsessive compulsive disorder and much more than that with some sort of general anxiety disorder. Like most things, these can be defined over a vast spectrum. Some cases debilitating, others mostly unnoticeable, but either way, you or someone close to you is likely dealing with some form of this. One of the primary byproducts is depression due to the heaviness and the seeming inescapability of the disorder. If this defines you, drop everything and pursue help with your symptoms. Relief is out there and a sense of normalcy exists. Heck, email me, at a minimum I can relate and listen. One of my favorite references for this tendency is “worry in search of a mission”. The obsessive thinking, or intrusive and catastrophic thinking, drives anxiety and the resolution is to perform compulsions or routines to dull the anxiety. Unfortunately, performing the routines only solidifies the minds need to have the routines performed to silence the anxiety and the pathway is formed in your mind and the cycle continues. Why am I sharing this very personal story and battle? Maybe like the first time I shared, it will diminish a bit of its current control. Primarily, I hope it can help someone else who battles with similar issues recognize they are not alone and maybe this could help them share their struggles and challenges with those closest to them, to find a bit of a reprieve and healing. I plan to follow this up with more analysis of the impact of my battle with OCD and even discuss some of the benefits. Sort of a glass half full view of the disorder.

Thank Anxiety and Stress,"My heart was pounding. My hands were shaking. I was probably having a mini (or full blown) panic attack. I wasn’t giving a speech, or in any imminent danger. No, this was something far more pedestrian. I was at a house party with some friends, playing an after dinner game. This confounding flight response was triggered when it was my turn and all eyes in the room turned to me. And just thinking about other people seeing me squirm made it infinitely worse. Entering a big party or a room full of people usually had the same effect — the unease and panic would just wash over me almost instantly. It made no sense. I’m definitely more of an introvert, but have always enjoyed the occasional party and time out with friends. At work, I regularly presented to small and large groups , including senior executives. I led teams. I might occasionally get nervous, but never to the point of the crippling anxiety I had recently started experiencing in social situations. It started a few years ago. It was extremely frustrating and I wasn’t sure what suddenly triggered it. I tried to logically reason it out. Both before, during and after these attacks. Didn’t help. I tried my hardest to push it away and just ignore my feelings. I had been good at doing that my whole life. That only made it worse. I tried hard not to think about it, to not anticipate this happening next time. Again, no luck. One thing I knew for sure was the answer didn’t lie in avoiding situations that triggered this. As tempting as it was to become a social pariah, I knew this obviously wasn’t a long term solution. It sounds like such a trivial thing, but it paralyzed me, made me lose confidence in myself, and also affected relationships and friendships. It was definitely a sign of some deep inner turmoil. It really forced me to focus and look inside for answers. And thankfully, the answers came. I finally decided to write about this in the hope that it may be helpful to others. If you’re reading this, you’re probably not experiencing the same situational anxiety I was. But we all have demons (stress, anxiety, depression, etc.) and I feel the insights I gleaned from my experience can hopefully apply in some of these situations. Do not run away from it As I alluded to above, if there is a particular situation that triggers stress or anxiety within you, as uncomfortable as it might make you, trying to avoid such situations is usually not the answer. You may be able to avoid them in the short term, but you’re not addressing the deeper issue, and not developing the grit needed to handle stressful situations in the future. Do not personalize it Whatever you do, don’t make the anxiety “yours”. Be careful how you refer to it, either in your inner dialogue or to others. You may be feeling anxious, but it is not “your” or “my” anxiety. By making it personal, we risk making it a part of our identity, and making it part of our story. It isn’t. You’re a glorious being that’s feeling anxious or stressed. Instead of saying “my anxiety”, use “I’m feeling anxious”. Don’t try to suppress or numb the pain Don’t pretend you’re not feeling anxious, or try to suppress it. You just want it to go away. You want to be strong. It makes you feel like crap so you’re trying your best to drown it out somehow. This won’t work. I also think it makes things worse in the longer term as these pent up emotions get stronger over time. I believe this is what may have happened to me, where years and years of ignoring and running away from underlying issues with stress and anxiety suddenly bubbled up to the surface and led to this extreme and crippling social anxiety. Thank it I really mean it. The next time you feel the pangs of anxiety or stress, instead of trying to suppress them, just silently thank these uncomfortable emotions and permission to “flow”. This is another way of accepting them, but in this case you’re embracing them completely. Give these energies a free pass to flow within you. The goal here isn’t to instantly feel better (and you probably won’t). In fact, quite the opposite as you really come face to face with your emotions. However, over time, this will act as a release valve, and will help create some “space” so you can (even if for an instant), step out and just be a witness to these emotions without getting caught up in them. “OK, there it is, I’m feeling extremely anxious right now”. It’s another way of bringing mindfulness to your experience. Let’s face it — we’re all a mishmash of messy emotions and feelings, both pleasant and not so pleasant. It’s a part of being human. We can’t always control these emotions, so let’s accept them and let them flow, instead of running away from them. This is true courage and strength. To be clear, it’s not about being “positive”, or trying to feel good. That would be trying to run away or suppress the pain. You’re just trying to acknowledge the emotions, not judging them and giving them a free pass to manifest, no matter how shitty they make you feel. I know, easier said than done. But this is probably the best way, or perhaps the only way to get through this. Practice! If certain situations are triggers for you, try emulating them by vividly visualizing these situations in the comfort of your own home (or wherever you’re comfortable). Meditate on them. Imagine you’re there. What do you see? How do you feel? Can you feel the anxiety or stress rise? Think of this as practice. Practice thanking the anxiety, visualize being there, and really let your emotions flow. Again, the goal isn’t to drive the anxiety away. It’s just to be a witness to this experience and to understand that it is within you and giving it an “outlet” to express itself. Do this again and again. It’s like training a muscle. With time, you’ll get better at creating some space between you and the emotion you’re feeling. Celebrate the present Wherever you are, whatever you are doing, try to be present. Live in the now. Celebrate this moment! A lot of times, without realizing it, we are just lost in our internal chatter that further churns up stress and anxiety. Be a witness to these emotions, but also try and bring your attention to the present. Mindfulness and meditation is very widely written about and practiced today. I think some of the best writing on this topic is in the Power of Now by Eckhart Tolle. Listen to it Don’t run away from it, don’t suppress it, thank it, be present. When you do this, you will feel the energy rush through you. When you do, try and listen to what the stress or anxiety is trying to tell you. Listen to your gut. What are you really afraid of? What will happen if these fears come true? What happens then? Dig deep! You may find that you might have to get through several layers of issues to get to the root cause. The answers may not come every time, but make sure to listen and try to really dig into this every time you feel this way. I used the above to go through a pretty intense process of detoxification and self-discovery over several months. It was uncomfortable, but I finally came face to face with my emotions and underlying issues. For me, it revealed the fear of being negatively judged, which further revealed the fear of not being accepted, not liked, and of being ostracized. It led to the realization that I wasn’t always my authentic self in public situations, with a fear lurking in the background that I may get “caught” at any moment. It also led to a much deeper insight below. Accept yourself I feared rejection, and lack of acceptance because deep down, I wasn’t accepting myself. I was highly critical of myself, and any mistakes I made, and I did this unconsciously throughout the day. It was auto-pilot behavior that probably got instilled in me somehow as a kid, and I didn’t even realize I was doing it most of the time. If I didn’t accept myself, how was I every going to expect anyone to accept me? And something tells me I wasn’t alone in doing this. So ask yourself the same question. Do you truly and unconditionally love and accept yourself? Almost like a marriage vow, but to your self! Interestingly, while writing this, I came across a great story on Medium yesterday on a slightly unrelated topic of turning your dreams to reality (here). It refers to the book The Untethered Soul, in which the author Michael Singer gives an example of a man with a thorn in his arm. It hurts badly, and even more so when he touches it, so instead of pulling it out, he structures his whole life around keeping his arm safe and away from harm. That’s a beautiful analog that pretty much sums up what I‘m trying to say. So take your medicine, thank your thorns and pull them out! You owe it to yourself and the world to be fully alive and present as your most awesome and glorious self.",2017
Productivity and Burnout,"I’ve been getting shit done these past few weeks. In place of narrative, here are a few numbers: this is my twentieth post in January, and in the first nineteen, I’ve written thirteen point five thousand words. My total for the whole of November was fourteen and a half thousand, and last month’s was fourteen thousand and three. Since Halloween, I’ve written just over forty-two thousand words. (The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy contains 46,333 words, and Saint Paul’s letters come in at forty-three thousand odd.) My average post length was five hundred words in November, six hundred the next month, and this month—so far—it’s seven hundred. My updates are longer and I’m publishing more of them, and overall, I’ve never blogged as productively as I am now. This month, I know how Babel’s builders felt. In the new year, I decided not to pursue a set number of posts in January, and not to try and catch up those I missed in December. (The month before, I’d published ten entries on the last night, leaving me burnt out for the next two weeks.) Both those decisions have paid dividends—not playing catchup meant I got back into gear much sooner this month—but in a way, they’ve also backfired. Getting so much done has made me feel honour-bound to top the last two months, and the goal of thirty-one posts in January now reasserts itself. Right now I’m publishing two every day, one after waking up, one before bed, and that puts me on track. I’m only just beginning to feel tired, and I’m looking forward to cutting the workload on February 1. Mainly, I’m worried I’ll falter before then or end up needing time off. My other source of angst is wondering if writing like this is healthy. Twice-daily posts have been on my mind for a while, but as a long term goal to work up to. At the moment, I doubt I can keep them up much longer. If exercise is about pushing slightly beyond what feels comfortable, keeping this up seems like it could become a writer’s version of hypergymnasia. On the other hand, it’s not something I set out on for the longer term—just a schedule for the last days of January—and any job has an overworked week here and there. I’m noticing, as I did three months back, that I’m an instinctive self-saboteur, with anxiety that adapts to change. It can be hard at times like this to know if my worries are rational, but if they are, the danger will soon pass. For now, best to get on with things.",2017
To Live In The Moment,"As I begin to reach the conclusion of my first month as a PhD student, I can look back at four weeks of persistent warnings in regards to the stress & struggles which line the path ahead. Thankfully, I also stumbled across an old parable, of Zen Buddhist origin, which could calm the wildest of internal storms. One day, while wandering through the wilderness, a man encounters a ferocious man-eating tiger. Startled & petrified, he runs for his life. But, close behind, the tiger gives chase. Soon after, the man reaches the edge of a cliff. Before he could even consider his next move, the tiger has him pinned to the floor. His only hope of escape is to suspend himself over the abyss by holding onto a vine that grows at its edge. Having no choice, he pushes away the tiger, jumps, and holds on to the vine. As he dangles from cliff, the man looks up. There stands the tiger, baring its fangs and snarling with hunger. With sweat dripping from his brow, he looks down. And to his horror, sees another tiger roaring & impatiently awaiting his arrival. He is caught between the two. As he considers his fate, two rats, one white, one black, scurry along the vine above him. As if his mind wasn’t consumed enough, they begin gnawing on the vine. He knows that as the rats kept gnawing, they will reach a point when the slender vine will no longer support his weight. He tries to shoo the rats away, but, alas, they keep coming back. At that moment, he notices a strawberry, growing on the face of the cliff and within reach of his left arm. It looks so beautifully plump and ripe. Holding onto the vine with his right hand, he reaches out with his left and plucks the strawberry. With a tiger above and another below, the man bites into the strawberry. Finding it to have the sweetest of tastes. The parable, of course, is about living in the moment. Seizing the day. Capre diem-ing. Despite his perilous situation, the man chooses not to let the unrealized dangers paralyze him. He embraces the moment, forgetting the hazardous paths ahead & behind which occupy his mind. I guess this is what makes life so fulfilling, the chance to dive head first into the unknown & revel in all that it presents.",2017
Let’s Talk,,2017
Coaching Over the Bridge,"People deal with their struggles in various ways. Some are more drastic than others. I was awakened early one morning by a phone call from the Sheriff’s Department. The Deputy told me one of the two bridges from one city to the other were blocked because a man was threatening to jump off the bridge. They wanted me to get to the bridge as soon as possible to talk him down. When I arrived, police cars were blocking both sides of the bridge. There was the man, perched on an I-Beam under the roadway 90 feet above a river known for its dangerous undercurrents. It seems strange to begin a conversation with ‘Hi, how are you?” in a situation like this, but that is what I did. The conversation led me to believe he was rational until he asked me to “come on down and have a seat” on the I-Beam with him. I quickly declined the request. Only after I asked him if he really wanted his children to know their father killed himself by jumping off a bridge that I persuaded him to climb back onto the roadway. He had isolated himself, without asking for help, and the internalized stress drove him to attempt to end his life. My coaching clients do not go to that extreme before seeking my assistance. I’ve found that one of the top three “needs” of business leaders is a trusted confidant. Releasing the pressure allows people to gain perspective. My clients know “what to do” and “how to do it.” Their struggle is they have forgotten “why” in life and business. They lost touch with their purpose. Five of the last six clients realized early in the coaching process they need someone to help them remember “why” they are doing “what” they do. Stress has overcome their success. Finding purpose is extremely relevant to individuals who are leading others. Without knowing the meaning of life and business, the person is driven by the circumstances of the day. My new short-term coaching process helps you answer these questions; Do you know your purpose? What obstacles are blocking the passion and ‘fun’ you once had in your work? How do you overcome the stress that hinders and changes your level of success? Expert Reactions:“We all deal with struggles every day….in our own way. What enables us to keep going is our sense of purpose. Maybe it’s our family or a cause very dear to us — in all cases, it’s something greater than we are. New business startups (especially technology ones) are taking place around the globe. These new businesses start out as solopreneurs with a clear purpose — initially surviving and bringing their idea to market. As the months wear on, what many are not prepared for is the loneliness and the sense of isolation that working by yourself can bring. It’s exciting to make all the decisions yourself, but it can also be overwhelming without a sounding board. Just like the young man on the bridge, it’s important to reach out. Having a mentor or business coach provides the entrepreneur a second voice and thereby releases some of the day –to-day pressures of running a business by yourself while helping to keep the original goal and purpose top of mind.” — Kevin FitzGerald, Startup & Leadership Coach, Speaker, and Blogger, Certified Leadership Expert, Speaker, Coach and Blogger. “As a former school superintendent, I know from personal experience, how completely overwhelming and stressful the demands can be in the life of a leader. The greatest gift a leader can give to themselves is the gift of a coach. As the saying goes, it’s hard to see the picture when you are in the frame.” We all need help in seeing our conditions and circumstances through a different lens; a lens that allows us to harvest the good and keep moving forward towards success. As an educator, I knew that my “why” in life was to help kids learn what they needed to be successful in life, but somewhere along the way, I lost sight of that “why” and focused all of my energy on tasks that left me feeling stressed and overwhelmed. Having a coach and a trusted confidant provided a path for me to gain more clarity in both my personal and professional life. Gaining new insights and perspectives is tough to do when you are all alone, trying to make sense of your own struggles. If you want to get back on track, rediscover your “why” and start enjoying the journey more, then don’t try to go it alone. Invest in yourself by having a coach. Your future self with thank you.” — Lynn Wicker, Author of Raising Kids That Succeed, Certified Leadership Expert, Speaker, Coach and Blogger.

DEAR THE BOY THAT MADE ME BELIEVE I WAS WORTH IT,"Dear the boy that made believe I was worth it, FUCK YOU They all tell you to just think happy thoughts it will get better! Or you know, meditation works wonders you’ll feel great all that stress will just melt away… I mean they have a point meditation helps, but it’s not going to make months of crying myself to sleep, and having to help friends out of depressions and suicidal moments JUST DISAPPEAR! Self love they scream… Don’t you think I fucking have it! I care about every damn bone in my body and try my damn best to take care of it… But some how that isn’t good enough. My soul is strong. I have a will to live. I have never once hurt the body in which it lives but yet all the time I question… Why do I exist… My health is not a joke for your edgy memes… My break downs and panic attacks rip me apart just so I can tape myself back together and pretend to be fine because I don’t want to show the hurt to a single soul But then I showed you… And now I am just angry. The sadness that still makes me cry myself to sleep is enveloped by frustration with you I trusted you with my most painful secrets. They may have not seemed like much but to me they were painful and gut wrenching and made me want to burry my face in a pillow and scream, but you, you took them and made me think that I had a chance to be better. That maybe my anxiety and depression were a weight I could handle. YOU MADE ME FEEL STRONG AND I HATE YOU FOR IT. I never ever want my strength and happiness to rely on someone else. Love is important whether platonic romantic or friendly but I WILL NEVER DEPEND ON SOMEONE for my joy. My strength comes from me not you. So when they were screaming this condescending bullshit about thinking happy thoughts and my anxiety magically disappearing I was frustrated and confused but you… YOU WERE CLARITY and I hate you for it I want nothing but to be able to exist with out this constant worry that am not good enough for myself… I was healing and starting over when you swooped in and convinced me with your eyes and funny jokes that when I was not okay, it was you who I had to turn too. Don’t get me wrong I NEED my friends and family more than anything in regards to my happiness however I don’t put my soul into that joy. It is not one sided but a partnership… but you made me believe that being happy was thinking about some stupid boy that controlled my view of friendship and happiness in a new place. That friendships always have one person putting in more effort than the other… Well screw you Because now I have never been more confident or felt more beautiful because you sir were an asshole who tried to make me believe that it was your job to fix me when I only wanted someone to talk to about cats. Sincerely, the girl who is healing on her own",2017
Relax,"I was in this sort of feelin’ my self mood and decided why not. How many of us try to catch up on old reruns of “ My so called Life” or “ Friends” only to be disrupted by one of your relatives telling you to go clean the kitchen, or getting a notice that you are just about to be terminated from your apartment. Yup, it doesn’t feel so exciting doesn’t it? When these things happen, it could definitely feel like a sting or like you’ve just been robbed of your freedom. No seriously, let me repeat that again. Like you’ve been robbed of your FREEDOM. I mean, don’t get me wrong we all have this sort of zest for life but when something like this happens, you just can’t go back to being Sponge Bob or Elle Woods from the Film “ Legally Blonde” right away. You just quickly go into Ice cube mode where you all of a sudden start losing your blank and start screaming and yelling and forget you were actually having a really good time before that. So, just how do you maintain your sanity at all times? Well, the answer is pretty simple. You have to be cool about EVERY single situation you are put in. Yup, that’s right. No matter if you won or lost the battle a couple of times. It doesn’t matter. It’s all about the experience. You could get through this. Right? We’ve all been there. If I could count how many times we’ve all cried our eyes out when we couldn’t get this or that right. I’d say we would get a substantial amount of badges for being the most heroic out there! I know it’s going to be a really difficult task to do but you’re going to have to remove all that tension and try to free your mind and put yourself in a better place. So please remember if you are the rich or poor guy equivalent to Jacobim Mugato from Zoolander (this ones funny) or Katniss Everdeen. It won’t matter. You could come back swinging in no time!",2017
#LetsTalk About Mental Illness,"Mental illness. My mother suffers from mental illness. She has since before I was born. For months growing up she would be in the hospital. I spent a lot of time in mental wards, visiting. They are not pleasant places. Just last week I went to pick her up from shock therapy and heard a woman screaming from a room down the hall. Which isn’t that weird, actually. And yes, they still do shock therapy. My whole life I have tried to understand what was going on with my mom. Sometimes I did understand. Most times, still, I do not. Two years ago I started taking medication for Anxiety and Obsessive Compulsive Disorder. I was terrified to see the doctor. I was afraid to even entertain medication. Driving into the parking lot that morning was a big accomplishment. I recall the details clearly. My fear comes in part from the things I saw my mom go through. Medication wreaked havoc on her body. Still does. She’s never fully recovered. It took a jolt to push past my fear. Two years ago I started to break down. My wife saw it. I saw it. I don’t think our kids saw it. I held things together as best as I could. I got to work on time (mostly) and kept up my responsibilities without a crack in the facade. And then one morning I couldn’t. I haven’t told this to many people. I’m still ashamed by it. It still feels like a defeat. I still feel I could be stronger, and maybe that I should be stronger. I should have more faith, perhaps. I certainly believed that when I was in Bible College. I did a lot of praying. I heard someone recommend the term Brain Health instead of Mental Health, to combat stigma. Maybe there’s something to that. It gets to the heart of what I’ve realized; my brain is a physical part of my body. An organ. It can be fixed insomuch at the rest of my body can be fixed. By doctors. My brain is not my personality. My soul is not marred by this. This illness is physical. Medical. Biological. Chemical. It is a layer I wear overtop of my being, always. It may go away. It may not. I considered a post last year during #BellLetsTalk, but I held back. I didn’t feel ready. For me, this whole conversation is fraught. Given my family history. it’s complicated. Since then, conversations with my wife and with friends have made me okay with this. Or mostly okay with this. I’ve read posts from some of you today, talking about your struggle. You’ve given me courage, so thank you. Stigma sucks and it keeps us in the shadows. Bad things happen in the shadows. Monsters grow there. Worries that were paralyzing have lost their grip on my future. Most of the time. Cyclical thoughts on endless loops will fade away or give way to other thoughts. A lot of the time. I’ve found the strength to do some incredible things with my life these past couple of years. I’m grateful for that. I’ve prayed about this and sometimes I still do, but to be honest it can be tiring to fight all the time, day after day and year after year. Sometimes prayer feels like that–an exhausting battle–when it’s constantly thrown at illness. If you’re dealing with mental illness, let’s talk. Really. Coffee or beers, I’m game.

When You’re Afraid to Go to the Doctor,"It’s called Iatrophobia. At certain stages of our lives, many of us are afraid to visit medical professionals. After all, needles, surgery, and getting naked for intimate examinations are no fun. And when we have an inkling that something might be wrong — that mole really is bigger than it felt last time we checked, or we have a nagging worry that those persistent headaches might be the symptom of a scarier problem — we worry that going to the doctor or dentist will confirm our deepest fears. But some people’s fear of the doctor exceeds these normal anxieties. Those suffering from iatrophobia, (about 3% of the population,) are so overwhelmed by their fear of doctors that they put off essential, preventative medical care, like blood-tests, mammograms, rectal and vaginal screenings for years, or even decades, putting their health and lives at risk. In many cases, people with iatrophobia imagine that preventative care, or medical treatment for what ails them, will involve far more pain and suffering than it actually does. So they avoid the simple but uncomfortable procedures that can detect early warning signs. And even those who arrange for medical screenings don’t follow up on bad news. For instance, 40% of women who receive abnormal mammogram results do not submit to a follow-up test as recommended by a physician. In so doing, they risk a worsening, even life-threatening scenario. And for many sufferers of iatrophobia, only a crisis, like a heart attack, finally sends them to the doctor. The first step toward overcoming such fear is to admit that you struggle in its grip. And the best person to share this admission with, is your medical practitioner. Although many sufferers imagine that their doctors won’t want to be bothered or that the medical team will find their patient’s fears ridiculous, it is not the case. Good doctors encourage people suffering from iatrophobia to make an appointment to talk about their anxieties. Because by naming their fear, the patient gives their doctor a chance to overcome it. When a supportive doctor describes a procedure ahead of time, using realistic, non emotive language, many patients can muster the courage to follow through with treatment. When a fearful person practices entering a hospital lobby, the elevator, and then the consultant’s office, they find they can make an appointment for surgery. When talking it through isn’t enough, physicians also treat patients suffering from iatrophobia in order to help patients overcome their most debilitating fears, so that they can undergo needed medical treatments.

The Never Ending “To-Do” List!,"“I can’t believe all the things that are on my plate.” How many times have you heard that or said it yourself? Every leader I coach has too much on their plate and as long as the stress isn’t too great, they love it! It’s only when you get mad or face a serious setback that it suddenly seems to be too much to handle. One leader I coached became so emotional about his unending ‘to do’ list that one day he simply stood up, swung his arm across his desktop and knocked everything onto the floor. In reality, he loves being busy and, at times, loves feeling overwhelmed. However, when his stress level exceeds his limits he gets angry and reacts. Sometimes we’re pushed to our limits and overreact because we engage in disruptive behaviors. I guarantee you can enjoy being busy and overwhelmed, without overreacting if you minimize certain behaviors. Hyper-responsibility — Take a look at your “to do” list; in reality how many of those things really need to be done and how many can you delegate? Hyper-responsibility means taking too much responsibility for things that you’re not directly responsible for. Believe it or not, there are things you cannot help; for example, your son failing English or a subordinate not reaching his goals. Saying “Yes” when you need to say “No” — Oftentimes leaders will agree to do a task when they have absolutely no time left in their schedule to accomplish it. This usually happens because you have a hard time saying “No” to someone. You don’t want to hurt their feelings or it’s a colleague who did you a favor in the past and you feel the need to reciprocate. Keep in mind, if you get angry about saying “Yes” to something it means you don’t have the energy to do it. Just say “No, thank you.” Guilt over poor choices — Let it go. If you are growing as a leader you are going to make bad decisions along the way; at work and at home. Admit the poor choice, apologize if necessary, and get back to doing what you do best, leading people. Expert Reactions:“This blog post by Dr. Rausch is a terrific reminder for overloaded leaders. Sometimes the reason we are feeling overwhelmed is due to our own issues, like not delegating, saying no to further commitments when there’s too much on our plates or recognizing that others should be responsible for their own issues. It’s great to have “to do” lists, but also great to look it over with a critical eye and see if anything can be either eliminated or delegated. Dr. Rausch’s blog contains many valuable reminders that help leaders stay healthy.” — Laura Akers, Former prosecutor, Speech Coach, Keynote Speaker, Presentation Skills Expert, Leadership, Writer and Activist “The Never Ending “To-Do” List gives leaders permission to let go. As an emerging executive, it can be very scary to delegate. There is that inner voice telling you to do it all, be it all and that you can’t trust anyone else to do a task as well as you can. That might be true, but your responsibility is to guide/train your staff to be their best, not do it for them. Saying No comes easier with practice and that list will begin to dwindle down. Guilt over mistakes is wasting your talents.

"“Don’t Worry, Be Happy”?","I wish somebody had told me that it’s OK to be anxious. That you don’t have to fight it. That fighting it is what makes it worse. — Mara Wilson If you’re like me, you probably never heard anyone talk about struggling with mental health growing up. And, if you’re also like me, you realize now that it may, ironically, be one of the reasons you saw so much mental health struggle manifest itself on a day to day basis around you. Since learning so much more about what it means to struggle with mental health, I’ve been reflecting on the experience of family and friends throughout my life. It occurs to me that so many people I’ve known (particularly my own self) have shown clear evidence of emotional, social, or psychological stress at some, or constant, times in their lives. I used to think that it was a blemish on someone’s character, a sign of depleted masculinity, or analogous to a temporary cold virus, but I realize now that this cultural conditioning only makes anxiety, in particular, worse. This point has been driven home to me of late as I’ve noticed one of my own children showing signs of anxiety. I always thought the best way I could help a loved one through this was to convince them that what they were thinking and feeling was irrational (which, to anyone other than the sufferer, it inevitably appears to be) and to assist them in “don’t-worry-be-happying” it away. But, guess what? That wasn’t helping. Instead, I’ve noticed the power of talking about anxiety the way Mara Wilson encourages us to do so below. Name it, look at it, acknowledge its existence and hold over you, then practice strategies and seek support to be resilient in its presence. I grew up in a time when most people told you not to worry, to be happy. I want my kids to know that I’ll be there to listen to their worries and do my best to support them in overcoming or, perhaps… even leveraging them?

Do Not Worry,"This may be the most difficult command for us to obey — “Do not be anxious about your life.” If we would only learn in the hidden parts of our souls to trust God in all things, to not worry, to not take on matters that are greater than we are, life would be so much sweeter. To worry is to assume a role in life that God has not entrusted to us, to imagine ourselves responsible for something which is quite beyond us. The word in the original language is merimnao, meaning to be anxious or agitated in our mind, to be troubled, to have our thoughts stirred up about a certain matter. It is related to the Greek word for scattering, and has the idea of being scattered in our thoughts, uncertain what to do first, who to look to in a crisis, unclear as to our own role. Paul used this word in Philippians 4: Do not be anxious about anything, but in everything by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving let your requests be made known to God. And the peace of God, which surpasses all understanding, will guard your hearts and your minds in Christ Jesus. (Phil. 4:6–7) The birds of the air were given by our Lord as an example of trust. They rise early in the morning and go about their work, yet they do not worry. They do not assume a role in their minds that only God can take on. Oswald Chambers describes worry as becoming impertinent, imagining that we know more than our heavenly Father. There is no question but that our worry, our pride, our unholy desires, our lack of faith, and our selfishness are the cause of much misery in our souls, and in this world. The Christian obligation to live in simple trust, to pray instead of worrying, results in life and joy, and is a blessing to others. To go about our days in faith will bless us and those around us more than we could ever imagine. In times when we feel overwhelmed we look to God: Pray first. Lay the whole matter out before Him, then see what He places on our hearts to do next. Ask for wisdom as to what is our part in the matter. Are we anxious because we have not learned the discipline to deal with a certain matter? Do we need to speak to someone and we have lacked courage? Do we need to let go of something that we have held too tightly to? Some matters are resolved by simple prayer, when we hand this matter over to God and commit ourselves not to worry about it. God takes it off of our shoulders and we have peace. Other matters, such as the raising of our children, we must give over to God daily, and even several times within a single day. Some worries, once we rebuke them, they pack up and leave. Others seem to merely move just outside the doorway of our consciousness, and wait until we invite them back in, knocking all the time. Those are the most difficult ones, but even there the principles taught by Christ apply. We simply must establish the habit of thinking along these principles. God can and we cannot. Children may hide from their parents’ advice, but they can never outrun their prayers.",2017
What is Mental Wellness Under Trump?,"I don’t know anyone who is doing “well” right now. Have we entered an era of perpetual anxiety and deep uncertainty? Is this the beginnings of what some historians are calling the rise of an authoritarian regime in the US? Having been in power for only one week, Trump has already reinstated the Global Gag Rule, pledged to revive the Dakota Access and Keystone XL oil pipelines, banned federal agencies and scientists from publicly reporting their findings, halted immigration from seven Muslim-majority countries, pledged to build a wall on the Mexico border and much more. Like many of you, my mental health has significantly declined since the election. I woke up each morning this week with a blast of adrenaline and a gut-wrenching pit in my stomach. I wearily reach for my phone and open up Twitter to see what Trump plans to roll out today. I scroll through in horror as my hands start to tremor. I’m anxious and drained. It’s not even 8am. When living in times like this, it’s hard to define a baseline “normal” let alone define wellness. People are handling the election of Trump in different ways. Organizing and fighting. Furious. In denial. Ignoring the news out of self-protection. Channeling pain into action. Crying. Creating art and writing. Seeking escape and solace. Debilitated under the pain. Developing unhealthy coping mechanisms just to get through the days. Terrified. Returning to ritual and drawing on the strengths of their ancestors. Isolating. Desperately needing and relying on community. Many of us experience a variety of these states throughout the day. All of us wonder: “How bad will this get?” This one question has been circling around my head over and over again: What is mental wellness under rising authoritarianism? Is it even possible? As a mental health advocate, I have never seen a national mental breakdown on this scale. Therapists, doctors, and healers have shared the same sentiment: Trump has sparked a tremendous uptick in emotional distress and requested services from their patients. Mental health challenges have developed or severely intensified for people across the nation. New physical health challenges are emerging. More people are seeking out medication — or whatever tools they can access — to manage the stress and pain. Friends are turning to self-harm and relapsing. This is even more intensified for those most impacted by the Trump administration — Black & Brown folks, Muslims, low-income communities, immigrants, people with disabilities, queer and trans folks, and women of all backgrounds. Communities are grasping to cope with the anxiety of these uncertain times — needing to figure out how to access healthcare, protect their families from the uptick of racial violence, and navigate immigration challenges brought on by Trump. The concept of wellness under the rising authoritarianism of Trump seems like an oxymoron — and it is. As Jiddu KrishnamurtiIt said, “It is no measure of health to be well adjusted to a profoundly sick society.” This is a new era. How we understand mental health and wellness must change to meet the times. Questions that have been rattling around my head: Western medicine generally asserts mental illness as an individual plight: That people with mental health challenges have chemical imbalances and we are each personally responsible for achieving our own wellness. While a person’s genetic and neurological composition are often contributing factors, conditions of society like racism and poverty also deeply impact mental health. Black and Brown mental health advocates — who are often sidelined from mainstream mental health conversations — have been asserting this and organizing around it for years. Trump is a symptom, not a root cause. He is a reflection of the conditions that communities of color have faced and fought in the US since its inception. Conversations about mental health in the Trump era must include the impact of social systems. Our failure to do so is incomplete and dangerous. Incomplete because repressive governments correlate to poor mental health outcomes. Dangerous because it gaslights people into thinking that their mental health challenges are an individual problem and not a collective failure of systems. As for the flood of Trump updates, many of us are reaching a breaking point. For those of us who have the privilege to pull away from the news, knowing how much to take in and how much to withdraw is proving very difficult. We can’t channel our energy into building if it’s all spent digesting and reacting to the horror. Turning inward at this juncture in history — while necessary — often feels not only irresponsible, but impossible. I’m sure there’s a balance to strike here, but I certainly haven’t found it yet. I intend to focus up on self-care over the next few days and I hope those around me will too. I want to tidy up my space, do an activity that puts me out of my head and into my body, return lingering texts from friends and family, get some laundry done, be outside and away from my computer for awhile, get a full night’s sleep, and make a therapy appointment. Over the next several years, there will be no shortage of opportunities to plug into social change work. We need you for this uphill battle: We need you rested and with eyes wide open. We need you focused and we need you at your most creative. Now more than ever, each of us is called to find balance between the energy to nourish ourselves and our loved ones, and the energy to flow into social change. There is urgency to build community and resist this administration. Give yourself the time and space to build up some strength and when you’re ready to get going, start here. If you’re in crisis right now, I see you. If you are struggling to get through the days, know that you are not alone. Here are some resources to support yourself and loved ones:",2017
…and just like that,"Without getting too deep into the details of the backstory, suffice it to say that 2012–2015 were some of the hardest years I’ve experienced that almost ended up in me taking my own life.(how’s THAT for an opening line?) Thankfully, it’s now late January 2017, I’m still around, in a much better spot in life, and happier than I recall myself being ever before. Throughout those years, I came across a quote that I subconsciously adopted and without even realizing, set in motion the most self-therapeutic endeavor I’ve ever taken on. “If you want to know what someone fears losing, watch what they photograph.” As it turns out, the thing I feared losing most was myself and off I went photographically documenting what ended up being a pretty incredible mental breakdown. The main themes throughout the series, if not almost immediately obvious, are of loneliness, anxiety, and crushing depression. Below is my series Solitude presented in no real specific order, with exception to the images in bed. After 15 months of documenting my downward spiral, September 2015 came along and, like a light switch had been flipped, I woke up one morning and felt absolutely fine. Anxiety wiped, depression completely faded away and for the first time in over 2 1/2 years I felt like a human being again, and I gotta tell ya: It felt great. It’s so strange at this point, a full year+ from ‘snapping back into it’, to look back at the person in the photographs. Not only does it feel like a million years ago, it also seems like it never even happened. Time has a crazy way of warping perspectives, never forget that.",2017
"Why I Marched, in Spite of Anxiety","I was sitting on my kitchen floor with a cup of chamomile tea, holding back tears and taking deep breaths. My screen lit up with incoming messages. “I know exactly how you feel,” one message read. “I tell myself that there are always safe places I can go to get away from the crowds, and that I’ll be with people, and that I won’t want to have missed out on what is our generation’s March on Washington. But I’m solidly 50/50 right now. I’m worried my friends will be disappointed in me if I don’t go because I’m anxious.” “I’m anxious as hell,” another said. “I think this is going to turn out to be one of the most important protests in a very long time. But also, it’s perfectly okay if you decide this isn’t the way you can express your solidarity. That being said, in all the protesting I’ve been around, I always look back and think, ‘Damn, what was I so worried about!’ at the end of it. From a human perspective, it’s really beautiful to witness the power, energy, and spirit that protesting generates.” I wanted to go. I wanted to be surrounded by thousands of women who were just as furious and bewildered and terrified as I was about everything that had transpired in the 2016 election. I knew that the crowd would be made up of individual people who had each decided to show up, no matter how inconvenient or daunting it might seem. But I was afraid. Along with thousands of other Bostonians, the footage of the 2013 Marathon bombing was indelibly burned into my memory. The concept of public gatherings had been sullied by a sense of imminent danger. As I tried to picture myself marching elbow-to-elbow with thousands of others, my chest grew tight, my heart began to race, my breathing became shallow, and my eyes filled with tears. I had been on the edge of a panic attack all day, and I wasn’t sure if I could move past it. — In most circumstances, my conscience would tell me to prioritize self-care over all other considerations. If it was causing me mental anguish, I wouldn’t be doing anyone any good by attending. But in this circumstance, I wondered, should my own comfort take precedence over the opportunity to be a part of something so much bigger than myself? And which would be worse — my anxiety over going, or my regret and shame over not going? In talking to my friends — two of whom would be marching in Washington D.C., in spite of their anxiety — my resolve strengthened. I had been feeling helpless and dispirited since November — and here was a concrete way to translate those emotions into a meaningful message. Here was a chance to stand with countless others in the pursuit of positive, critical change. If I felt at all uncomfortable once I was actually there, I promised myself, I could leave–as long as I’d heard Elizabeth Warren speak first. — When I woke up on Friday — Inauguration Day — I knew that I’d made the right decision. I walked to work that morning with a defiant smirk that I couldn’t hide. Donald Trump could go ahead and take the oath of office — but come Saturday, we’d be out there on the streets of every state in the country, ready to show him exactly what he’d gotten himself into. On Saturday, I laced up my sneakers and headed to the train. It was packed by the second stop. In other Boston suburbs, the trains grew so crowded that they couldn’t accommodate any more passengers. The energy continued to build as we neared the city and hundreds of women climbed aboard. — Originally published at www.featherflint.com on January 24, 2017.",2017
But there has to be a REASON…,"Sitting with discomfort. It sucks, but it’s necessary. Sometimes, anxiety almost makes sense. In 2003, for instance, I was under the mistaken assumption that if I didn’t owe state taxes, I didn’t have to file state taxes. I think I knew it was wrong at the time, but it was easy not to file them. And truly, I didn’t owe money. So, when the postman showed up on my doorstep to drop mail in the box and knocked on the door first before depositing my stuff, I didn’t really think about it. Not even a minute later, I pulled the mail from the box, and there were certified mail cards. At that moment, I went into full-blown panic mode. I actually turned around and attempted to chase the mailman down in his van. I ran behind him, sobbing, yelling at him to stop so I didn’t have to go to the post office. But, eventually, I did go. And it seemed, by all accounts, to be dire news. The IRS had sent me forms indicating I owed a bunch of penalties for not having filed. I was terrified — frozen. Did I file my taxes as a result? Yes. Did I get a decent-sized refund? Sure did. Did that matter? Nope. Here we are, 14 years later, and I still have to steel myself when I get the mail. I still have to give myself credit for taking the mental leap every time I stick my key in the box. So, that spark of anxiety I feel when I consciously choose to get the mail? It, in its weird way, makes sense. Then, there are days like today. About three hours ago, the dread feeling settled in. Why? Did something happen that my intuition sensed, but my brain didn’t? Have I forgotten something? Am I overreacting? Feelings that come from fear are nothing. My thoughts are nothing. Trying to explain the unexplainable is an exercise in futility. There might not be a reason. There probably isn’t. See? Sitting with discomfort. Uncomfortable, but necessary.",2017

Feels good.,"Man everything is so frustrating, i’m using this as a tool to just vent now, hoping that noone sees this stuff i just need an outlet to vent to. Everytime i get bored or just all the time i automatically go to facebook!! and i don’t want to anymore, i want to just be focused on what it is that i’m doing but its really really freaking hard!! omg. I have nothing to do right now! i have hardly any money, nothing to really show for myself and on top of that I can’t even fucking produce good content with the one thing that i want to do in life which is music. it’s fucking annoying. Dude like why cant i just fucking do what i want to do without getting distracted, it’s like i have the attention span of a 9 year old! this is probably not even good for me to write this, it’s probably just making me more frustrated but i have to vent to some degree or else i’ll just die. lol I just wish a whole bunch of things were different and i’m sick of complaining and having nothing change i’m sick of trying to change and not changing i’m sick of making plans and then having them fall through, i’m sick of waking up everyday to a failures mentality. Man i have this fucking vision in my head of who i want to be and where i want to be and when i look at my life its just like feeble attempts at being that. i was rendering a video and while its rendering i cant do anything else to it so i said well let me check facebook… knowing i have nothing on facebook to check cause noone gives a shit about me and my friends all ignore me on there basically i think. i have no other websites where i can vent cause i hate people thinking that i want sympathy its not that i want sympathy its just that i want to get some shit out!!! and for some people that just too much to handle! so i keep my ass quiet. I know that if i go on facebook too, i’ll just end up finding myself in some stupid mindless video about how! girls think guys brush their teeth or whatever!! and i’ll just end up getting sucked in the vortex of facebook mindlessness and spend my energy in a wasted place that once i get out i’ll be like….. hmmm wow i cant believe i just spent my life doing that when i could have been doing anything else. but my life is so wack that like what else do i even have to do lol. the thing is that i dont even want to have this battle with myself about going on facebook or not i dont even want to have that thought i want to be like “ okay well my video is rendering let me do this because i know thats going to help this” straight away. My life is so fucking boring and i, honestly sick of it, its been basically the same for like 3 years and i need a change its disgraceful. I realize non of the above made any sense really but thats kind of the point of it, it’s supposed to make sense but not at the same time. Fuck facebook and FUck the internet but i need this shit to succeed in music but noone fucking likes me online, i need to find my friends online that vibe with the same shit as me, the same mentality and the same kind of views on life and things like that and people that like my music i need to find those types of people so that i can start living a life online and in real life thats true to me, the life im living now does not represent who i want to be or who i am on the inside and it’s time that i made a change, and i’m sick of saying things like that then diverting back to normal. i need real change . i need new friends on facebook ones that actually care about who i am and actually care about me and i need people in my life to talk to that i can understand and be on the same level as. and i need to be doing the things in my life that i always dreamed of doing. instead of sitting on the couch looking at mindless stuff on the internet i need to be going out to shows PERFORMING and or watching others perform going and being around other artists and creative geniuses and emersing myself in the music industry, all the things i post online should be who i really am not some filtered version of me in order to serve some kind of weird agenda to fit into peoples bubbles that so wack i need the line of communication to be direct when i come on facebook and want to express or post or put my music up. why have friends that i dont vibe with on there. I need a clensing. it’s time for a change! I need to start living my truth as corny as that sound but that is what i need to start doing, thats the only way im going to progress, the way things are now there is no way i’m going to progress in life and move towards the things that i want to move towards. i need things to be different in order for me to grow. full stop that is the reason why im venting, and im so glad that i was able to get to the bottom of this feeling of frustration in my heart and realsize why im truly frustrated, it’s because im living a life that is not true to the person that i want to be and to the person i need to be in order to grow, my environment right now is not conducive to my mental health my physical health, my expression as an artist and my sanity as a person. This is one of those times where i need a re cleanse. thank you medium for letting me vent like this. I do feel like there is more though. my plan of action is to delete everybody from facebook that isnt family and that i do not talk to or that im not actually friends with and that i dont actually like. then my next step is what i’ve been planing for this year anyways which is to perform more and really step out of my shell and embrace my wings, i know that if i jump i will fly i have to not be afraid though and i will succeed. i need to come up with a poem to share, write songs to share, go out and make music videos with Topher and my friends which i will make that are similar to me and that work well with me and the friends i need to be around but i’ve been holding myself back from meeting. i know they’re out there and i know the life i’ve dreamed of living is out there but i’ts up to be to go and get it. Here i come world and if anything is frustrating me in the future ill be sure to come back to Medium and vent the fuck out of it but for now it’s see you later because i gotta go do shit. Peace.",2017
You Again,"When you start taking antidepressants and other psyche meds, you start to thing that your old enemies — depression, anxiety, OCD, etc — leave you for good. Sadly that’s not the case. I’ve been on my meds for almost 9 months (after a 5 year hiatus) and taking them has become so routine that sometimes I forget that I’m even on them. I start to feel, what’s the word? The one we all crave more than anything and chase after like an addict chasing the dragon? Normal. “Normal” has a slightly different meaning to everyone, but to me it means “not mentally ill”. It means that I can go a full day without crying for no reasons. That dropping something by accident won’t make me watch to punch a whole through a wall. That someone saying “good morning” at work won’t make my heart race so much that I have to hide in bathroom to try and talk myself out of a panic attack. My meds help with that, but they don’t “cure” it. Even when I take them every day like I’m supposed to, anxiety, depression, and mania creep back in. They usually make their reappearance when I’m vulnerable — i.e., when I’m stressed, not sleeping well, not taking care of myself. They slip back into my mind and spread their lies again. You can’t handle all of this — you know it’s just going to come crashing down on you again. They dig deep into the insecurities I’ve tried to bury and brings throws them right in front of me, like hurdles I try to avoid as I run from them. You’re too fat. You’re so lazy. You’re so ugly. You’re too inexperienced to do a good job. They’ll see through you soon — they all will. The harder I try to run from them, the more I realize that I can’t escape them — they’re a part of me. The only thing to do is to confront them…and accept them. I accept that I have a mental illness. It’s taken me 28 years, but I accept and acknowledge that I need medication and certain lifestyle changes to live a happy, healthy life. I accept that this is something I will battle for entire life. And I accept that no matter what I do or how hard I try, I will still have bad days. Because like everything else in this world, medication is not perfect. There is no cure for mental illness, there are only tools to make it easier to life with, meds being just one of them. There’s also therapy, exercise, music, art, writing, friendship, family, animals, and so much more. I accept that my mental illness will show the ugly side of it, but I also know that it won’t stay forever. I know that as long as I keep trying my best and stay strong, it will leave again and I’ll be even better prepared for the next time it comes back.",2017
Sitting in Class,"Well, part of it has to do with the topics being discussed in class. But then the other part has a less concrete explanation. After all, no one is forcing me to engage in some lovely discourse. No one is pressing me for my thoughts. No one is expecting anything from me. If you look at the classroom of students, we all look the same — silently pretending to pay attention– It’s quite frustrating having to sit and struggle and squirm. Am I different? Am I unique? Is this what special people feel? Originally published at tayzau.com on January 27, 2017.",2017
How to Deal with Anxiety and Stress — 5 Best Ways,"by Linden Smith Perhaps no other word is so well known and so constantly passed around as the words “anxiety,” “depression,” and “stress.” But while these words have been making the rounds of the worlds of young adults — and even children — these days, it comes as a mammoth surprise how little people actually know of their connotations. Most of the people, most of the time, will know that they are suffering from a severe case of anxiety and depression but will hardly ever know what to do next. Knowledge pertaining to anxiety and depression usually ends at just being aware of the problem — as, for the solution, it is bare to be seen. Adults have always had the most complaints regarding their being depressed but as we move on we find an alarming number of young adults and children joining the brigade of the depressed and the stressed. In most of the cases the cause of stress and anxiety is not difficult to put down either — financial problems, childhood abuse, post-traumatic stress, loss of a loved one, failure — there is an entire list of things that could cause stress and anxiety in a person. And while it is important, most certainly, to point out what the root cause of depression really is, what is equally important and is totally dismissed is the solution — people often focus on the cause, and the effect, but never the solution. This is exactly where the misplaced priority lies and needs to be corrected — and it needs to be corrected immediately for anxiety and stress are phenomena that gradually and eventually break a person down completely. Before that breaking point is reached, it is imperative that such depressing phenomena are dealt with accordingly. It is easy to identify feelings of stress, depression, and anxiety. The symptoms are telltale and all too common as of today — there is a general feeling of dejection and sadness, the person feels the constant need to isolate himself, doesn’t talk to people or sit with people or hang around people in general, and lacks both in his sleep and nutrition. People suffering from the like might not know instantly that there is something off, but over time it becomes evident that there is a perpetual feeling of unhappiness that surrounds them, topped with nervousness, helplessness, worthlessness, and other such feelings. Generally, the aura is negative, pessimistic, and cynical. Silver linings are not to be seen and optimism becomes an archaic concept. These are people for whom the glass is either half empty, or poisoned, or simply not there. A sense of loss envelops them and failure seem to overshadow all achievements. And while such people might be shunned and written off as “melodramatic,” depression, stress, and anxiety are all too real and all too problematic to be brushed under the carpet so fleetingly. If and as soon as a person realizes he is a victim of anxiety — or even if people around him realize such — he needs to be cured of the devil’s disease: because the longer one stays under grey clouds, the more he is prone to delve into grey areas better not penetrated if one’s own welfare is dear. So how exactly do you overcome anxiety or work towards curing it if you realize you’re a victim? Well, a visit to the therapist or a psychiatrist does sound like a good enough idea but here’s a list of things that will better help you in taking care of yourself — and none of these tidbits will force you to open up in front of a person when you’d rather drown in the depths of self-pity: 1.Exercise It might sound odd, yes, but exercising not only relaxes your muscles — it relaxes your body in its entirely. Exercising has always been good for the body, good for the soul, and good for the spirit. Take out half an hour — just a measly 30 minutes — from your daily routine and work those muscles off. Let the heat out — and pull the fresh air in. 2.Yoga Meditation is not known for its therapy like effects for nothing. Meditating for even 20 minutes each morning will let you revel in a sense of calmness and serenity as you never felt before. Yoga is a perfect medium of cure when it comes to stress that as spread to all parts of your body — remember, when the heart is sick, you need to sit back and let it all out into thin air. Yoga or meditation offers a great therapy for those under stress. 3.Say No to Caffeine This might sound harsh — but you need to cut down on caffeine intake. Drop coffee. Drop tea. Go with water or juices. Alcohol and caffeine can technically infuriate and stress you further — which is something you do not want happening to you. 4.EAT Yes, stress and anxiety do make you want to not eat, not do anything basically, but you do need to eat and eat properly. Do not skip meals, no matter how badly you want to. Go with your proper intake of meals, and keep your body in perfectly nutritious balance. A healthy body is a key to a healthy spirit — and stress sickens the spirit as well as the body. Work on feeding both! 5.SLEEP Even if you are not drowsy. Just lie down. Close your eyes. Try and go into that sweet place called dreamland and forget about your fears for once. Sleep is an extremely important factor in people’s health and especially for people who suffer from anxiety and stress. These people usually end up patients of insomnia and with huge eye bags which make them look like half vampires and half zombies — lack of sleep also is ill for your general health. It makes you cranky, and even angrier. Not to mention less energetic. You will feel drowned, exhausted, and more stressed out than normal. It is a fact well known that proper sleep leads to a proper functioning of the body — and leads to a proper cure for anxiety as well! Thank you for reading.

Sometimes all we have to do is to find a Purpose in Life.,"Plus I learned, we can start this quest with the simplest of the purpose. Something extremely personal. For example: Going out for a walk/jog every day. In fact in this matter Good Habits, Healthy Habits are always the best starters. Thereafter as the body-mind combine gains back its strength, you can then choose a bigger purpose to chase. This then will be something that will give you a true sense of growth as a person, as a human being. Like this we can gradually transform our life. Finally, what i learn is that a lot of people, including our family, may do a lot of things to us; yet in the end what matters is what we do to ourselves. Good Wishes. Love. Warmth. Peace",2017
What are you most concerned about when meeting someone new?,Vote here,2017
New World Resolutions,"Wherever you stand relative to the political fence, here are five steps to take now so you have the stamina to stay informed (but not overwhelmed), to care for your self, and to be there for the people who need you. MOVE ENOUGH: With the tsunami of news, you’ll tend to be glued to your screen. That will certainly exercise your mind, but won’t do a thing for your body. Make a pact with yourself: get up and move for a minute every hour of your workday. Take a trip to the drinking fountain, or slip away for 60 quick jumping jacks. By using your muscles, your metabolism is revved up and your eyes get a rest from short-range staring. Active breaks also jumpstart creativity. While you’re allegedly “doing nothing,” your subconscious mind continues to work. Very likely, when you return to your keyboard, a fresh idea will have popped into your head. To make sure you are durable for the long run, keep with the daily recommended half-hour of persistent movement. A multi-tasking way to get your exercise is to walk or bike all or part of your commute (such as by parking farther away from the office). CHOOSE YOUR FOOD: When your mind is on the Big Picture, you may not want to bother with what you eat. But it’s a matter of garbage in, garbage out — and there’s a whole lot of garbage lurking in vending machines and wrapped in attractive packaging. The fact is, if you don’t eat nutritious food, you’re going to feel lousy and will not operate at full strength. Be sure to have those three meals, eating mainly fruits, vegetables, grains, and lean protein. If you fill your plate with foods of different colors, you’ll have a rainbow of different nutrients. Avoid fried and sugary. That way, you’ll eat fewer calories, which is crucial for sit-down occupations. In the old days, a 155-pound guy working on a farm burned 400 calories an hour. Plowing through your desktop doesn’t even break 100. PAY ATTENTION TO PEOPLE: With all that’s going on, you may feel compelled to stay locked onto the digital world, but the analogs in your life still need your attention, love and guidance. As Stephen Covey writes in The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People, for machines to be considered “efficient,” they work faster and longer. But to be “efficient” with a person, you need to stop what you’re doing and listen. When your child, boss, or other of your VIPs approaches, show them you still care: set down your device — or if you’re on a larger screen — turn to face them. That way, you’ll hear what they say — and they’ll know it. Keep in mind that your children, especially, look to you as an anchor of calm and kindness during turbulent times. Help your family plan time wisely with the Time Priorities Checklist. Click here for Checklist GET OUTSIDE: Change, especially when it happens fast, invariably stirs up a welter of emotions. You’ll need some time away from the action. The quickest and easiest way to bring your self back in balance is to step outside — alone or with others. Feeling the breeze or the warmth of the sun will soothe your frazzled soul. Because you are a human animal, planting your feet on the solid, dependable earth is reassuring. Simply gazing at green plants lowers blood pressure and lessens tension. The sheer enormity and constancy of the physical world puts indoor concerns in perspective. As nature philosopher Martin Ogle observes, “There are many questions being outdoors helps answer.” SLEEP WELL: To be durable when you’re awake, you need to detach at night. While you sleep, information you consumed during the day is filed into long-term memory so it’s there when you need it later. Getting too little sleep erodes overall health in part because your body doesn’t have time to maintain its own systems. For instance, just the way a dishwasher washes dishes, sleep naturally flushes away toxins that build up in your brain. To ensure you sleep soundly and your cerebral dishwasher can work: charge your phone out of earshot and use an alarm clock to wake up. That way, the phone’s sounds, vibes, and tempting nighttime texts won’t disturb you. Also: use Post-It notes to dim the sleep-disrupting lights of wall-mounted devices such as thermostats and smoke alarms. Scottish social commentator Thomas Carlyle once wrote: Our grand business is not to see what lies dimly in the distance, but to do what lies clearly in hand. Resolve now to take better care of yourself so you have more energy and strength to care for your own business and those who depend on you.

10 Tips to Instantly Change Your Mood,"Sometimes it’s just impossible to shake that bad mood, however much you try. Here’s a handy guide to the quick and easy ways to instantly change your mood. This one does sound a bit weird, but if you can’t do any of the others on this list, having a look at cat pictures totally calms you down. Scientific research explains that watching kitty videos lowers (human) stress levels, so you might want to get started with these YouTube collections. Step 1: Find a friend you like and want near you while you’re feeling this way. Step 2: Talk about it while they listen. Step 3: Repeat as necessary. Sometimes getting what is bothering you out there in the open air is the best, quickest thing to change your mood. It can even be as small as a candy bar: the point is, if you’re after a quick mood changer, buying something — anything — is it. Science has proved that ‘retail therapy’ is a real thing, and that when cash changes hands, your brain releases endorphins (the happy hormone). Plus, you get something new to enjoy, which is always nice. The quickest mood-changer of them all? Fire up some up music. You could go for a feelgood song with inspiring lyrics, a song that brings back positive memories for you or — if you’re feeling adventurous, classical music is supposed to be the best of all. At the very least, listening to music will take your mind off what was bothering you in the first place. Another quick fix to change your mood — do something good for someone else. From helping a family member with a task, to carrying something heavy for a stranger in the street. By taking the focus off your mood and onto someone else, you’re changing a negative feeling into positive energy. Seeing the person you’ve helped’s gratitude will make an impact on you. Of course if they’re not grateful, try to find someone who will be, or try another item from this list. Animals are a fantastic source of instant stress relief, and are scientifically proven to improve your mental health. So, if you don’t have a pet yourself, go round to a neighbor or a friend. Failing that, find your local animal shelter — they are always looking for people to give their animals a bit of attention, or for volunteers. This one’s a general good skill to learn, but meditation can be good for your brain, as it strengthens the areas responsible for processing (thinking/decision making/rationalizing) and empathy (understanding others). Practicing it regularly might even help you avoid some of those future bad moods waiting to happen! If you live near some running water, such as a lake, river or waterfall, hearing the sound can be relaxing and calm you down instantly. Getting out an about is always a good idea to change your mood, however if you don’t live near any water, running a bath or listening to the sound of it would also work. This one doesn’t really need explanation (what’s better than a nice warm bath/shower?) other than feeling clean and having some quality relaxation time lets your mind wander, and easily calms you down. otherwise, how else would this hilarious/crazy/thought-provoking /showerthoguths subreddit have been created? Look at the picture on the left. How does this room make you feel? It’s dirty, messy and probably makes you feel a bit on edge, doesn’t it? There’s a reason people say ‘tidy space, tidy mind‘. And once you’ve tidied up (even a tiny bit), you’ll start to feel like you’ve achieved something, and maybe in a better mood too. Did you try these tips? Which were the most helpful?

I was right …. until I was wrong,"​(This blog post appears on my wife’s blog — From The Flip Side) http://www.whatsyourdrivingforce.com/from-the-flip-side The know-it-all in the family, that seems to be a role that I acquired. It’s all I’ve ever known. I’ve always been the one that’s been right until I was the one that was wrong.  Here’s a little background. I grew up with a Mom that was very headstrong. She would only accept things her way and there was no room for discussion. So as I grew up I always thought I was right. I thought I was right until the day that I was wrong. When I was 26 I married my husband Greg and shortly after that we had our son Nick, followed by Matt and lastly, Ryan. I had my daughter Brittany from a previous relationship and we were pretty happy family except for when we weren’t. I was the right one. I was the one that always had everything taken care of — I paid the bills, I took care of the kids, I took care of the house. I was pretty much in charge of everything marriage wise. I was the one who had to have my own way and who didn’t agree with any ideas that didn’t reflect what I thought. There was no room for compromise. My poor husband put up with me. He dealt with me. He loved me. And most of all he stayed. Half the time I don’t know why he did. I knew I wasn’t easy to get along with.  I’ve also found out that over the course of time of having to be right that I was pretty miserable. We never really fought, we always got along, we never really had disagreements and that was mostly because there was no reasoning. I wouldn’t have allowed an opinion that was different than my own. Over the course of time I was growing up and maturing plus adding in a lot of self development. I found that I had serious control issues. I’m certain that this comes from my upbringing because I was a duplicate of my mom. In fact one of my brothers coined me Mini-Mom. I also found that part of the reason for my control issues was that I had severe anxiety. A symptom of anxiety is the need to be in control. When you lose control your world suddenly spirals and it causes these feelings inside that are completely distressing. It causes you to not know where to go next and makes you unsure of your choices. It makes you unsure of your life. It makes you turn into a person that you don’t even recognize.  I found out the hard way that I had anxiety. I started having panic attacks. It’s been the most horrible experience in my whole entire life. I would give birth a thousand times over rather than have a panic attack. After dealing with minor panic attacks or what I assumed were panic attacks (I wasn’t officially diagnosed until more than a year later), I figured it was something that would go away and that I was over caffeinated, that I was smoking too much, and I had too much stress. It was anything that was an outside force that wasn’t directly me. It was a situation that I could blame so I wouldn’t have to take any responsibility for the fact that I was causing my own destiny. My body couldn’t handle it anymore. I couldn’t handle the stress, the worries and the nervousness. It threw me into a full-blown panic attack. For some of you, I know you probably have had a panic attack. Others of you may think you have had a panic attack and for everyone else you probably have never had a panic attack. Count your blessings if you have not. If you think you might have, you didn’t. If you did, you know that it’s one of the most scary and horrific feelings in the entire universe. You lose complete control of everything. In a sense you feel you’re going crazy. I had a panic attack from Saturday afternoon that lasted all the way until Tuesday because my body kept throwing me back into it. If you research you know normally a panic attack will last approximately 10 minutes. While 10 minutes is like a lifetime, four days was almost too much for me to handle. I was at a point of wanting to check out. Literally check out, it was almost too much to handle. I knew I had to see somebody and so I called and made an appointment to talk to a therapist. Nobody ever wants to do that, it is ultimately admitting that there is something wrong with you. There’s something wrong with you that you can’t fix. When it’s with your brain it has a stigma that makes people think that you are crazy, you are suicidal, you are nuts, you are going off the deep end, and you hallucinate. We’ve all heard someone say “oh so and so’s CRAZY”. There are so many things that go along with somebody saying mental illness. (Anyway back on track) I went in and I talked to a therapist. She says, yep, you have severe anxiety. The diagnosis was almost worst than the symptoms. It confirmed there was something “wrong” with me. She told me you need to go to the doctor and get on some sort of anxiety medicine. This was just more confirmation that something was wrong with me. I did not want to do that, but at that point I trusted her and I knew I had to do something because I could not stand it, my body was going haywire. According to my doctor the anxiety medication Lexapro was supposed to calm my anxiety and help prevent a panic attack. It was suppose to give me a more normal life everyday where I wouldn’t have to feel the feelings that come with anxiety. The thing about it was, I didn’t want to take the meds. I grew up in a family where you don’t take medication unless it’s a last resort. You don’t go to the doctor or seek any kind of professional help unless you have no other option. But at this point I didn’t have another option so I started the meds. I was to the point where I couldn’t even get up off of the couch and walk to the bathroom without literally thinking that I was going to die. I also had a severe case of disassociation. Disassociation means that you feel like you’re floating and watching your life go by. It makes you feel that you are not real. This was absolutely the scariest part of this whole anxiety situation. The panic attack was horrible. The fact that nothing seemed real around me, everything seemed a million miles away was absolutely, without a doubt, the scariest thing I have ever experienced. When you don’t feel like you’re real and you don’t feel like the things around you are real, it makes you question who you are. It makes you question what’s going on. The only thing you do want is for it to stop, but you don’t know how to make it stop and you wonder if it’s ever going to get better. About three months after being prescribed the medication I decided that I did not want to be on it anymore. I did a lot of research about anxiety and knew that there were other ways, they were lot harder than taking a pill but there were other ways. Taking a pill every morning and calling it good, that was easy. The other ways to help me deal with my anxiety were not as easy. It was time consuming and uncomfortable. I had to take a hard look at myself, which wasn’t the easiest thing to do. It’s not easy admitting you might be your own worst enemy. I’ve done a lot of meditation. I practice mindfulness. I receive acupuncture regularly. I also journal and draw. I stay away from all caffeine and all types of nicotine. I also do a lot of breathing exercises, morning affirmations and self guided imagery. These things are not easy to learn. They take time out of my day but it gives me a sense of control. I choose everyday to not let my anxiety stop me. And it took a long time to get to that. There are still days where the idea of going to an appointment gives me butterflies. There are still times when going to bed at night it causes my mind to wander. I know a lot of people may think anxiety is just being worried. Oh, you’re just worried about something? It’s no big deal. Why would that bother you? Anxiety is so much more than that. It is a mental illness. It is something that people struggle with everyday and I consider myself one of the fortunate ones. I got diagnosed. I got help. I’m still receiving help. I have the drive and desire to do something about it.  I’ve strayed pretty far away from my original start of needing to be in control. The reason I added this all in here is because I just needed to let it out! Another reason is that having panic attacks and being diagnosed with anxiety is the best thing that’s ever happened to me. It’s been beyond my biggest blessing. I used to be very angry, very short-tempered, very particular and I probably still am in some cases if you asked my family. But it’s something I’m constantly aware of every day. I decided to not let my situation impact my family in the negative way that it used to. I also am striving very much to not let my children pick up on my bad habits. I’m working hard every single day that they don’t grow up in a situation where no matter what they do it’s wrong. So I keep working on myself and try to become a better person.  So to wrap this up, I was always right until I was wrong. I found out that either you can be right or you can be happy. I feel way more in control than I ever have. The marriage that my husband and I have now is beyond amazing. I’ve been blessed. He stood by me, he stayed with me, and he saw the good in me when I couldn’t see anything good in myself. He knew I wasn’t the person that I was portraying. I can’t imagine how many nights that he must have prayed for me. How many nights he must have prayed so that he could stay strong. How many times he probably questioned what the hell he was even doing here. I thank God everyday that he stayed and that he saw me for me instead of simply for the actions that I had. I imagine if you ask him he’ll say, “Oh, it wasn’t that bad”. I’ve asked him and that’s what he’s told me. I can’t believe that’s the truth but I think we all know that we’re harder on ourselves than anyone else ever could be. I’m extremely hard on myself. I regret a lot of things I’ve done and things I’ve said in the past. I regret the ways that I’ve acted towards my husband and towards my kids but I also know that each one of those steps led me to where I am right now. And this is a beautiful place. Without the pain and heartache I would have never gotten to where I am now and now is my biggest blessing of all.  I have the chance to take control of my life and turn into the person that I thought it was on the inside but didn’t know how to portray on the outside. I didn’t know how to step back, be vulnerable and let people in. I did not know I didn’t have to be right. I’m telling you that your experience probably isn’t going to be what mine was like. I hope you don’t have to go through all of the steps that I had to go through to get to where you’re going. Before that happens, let people get to see who you are on the inside. I’m sure there’s a lot of you reading this that find my story somewhat interesting. Maybe because you’re nosy or maybe because it relates to you, either way I’m glad you took the time to read this. Just remember, don’t be a right fighter. There’s a saying either you can be right or you can be happy. I can’t find anything that’s more true. As a side note, for any of you dealing with mental illness, this was my experience and I hope it helped you some. Also, I wanted to mention that although prescription drugs were not for me that doesn’t mean they are not for you. Everyone is so different, do what is best for you! To everyone else be kind. You never know what someone is dealing with on the inside. Inside your own head can be a very scary place to live.",2017
A 2-minute exercise to enhance the health of your nervous system,"Do you remember John Travolta and Samuel Jackson discussing foot massage in a classic scene in the movie Pulp Fiction? I have to admit I looked it up again on YouTube before writing this post. In his unique way, John Travolta reminds us why foot massage is so very special. I believe there are a number of ways to think about foot massage or reflexology. You might consider this as something very intimate, but this technique can also become an incredibly healing self-care ritual. Health researchers describe that adults and children, and many animals need the touch to thrive and prosper. About 10 years ago, I was introduced by a friend of mine to the concept of getting a regular massage. I’ve been pretty good about getting a massage as a part of my self-care routine ever since. Massage helps to improve blood circulation throughout your body. It brings more oxygen to the tissues helping to heal wounds and injuries. Massage releases toxins from your muscles, as well as pain-relieving and happiness-inducing endorphins. Some time ago, I started wondering about ways of prolonging the benefits of this intervention. Many of my students don’t have the resources to get a regular massage. I asked a massage therapist, Jean Svizzero, and she recommended 2 self-massage techniques that resonated with me — dry skin brushing and self-reflexology (or self-foot massage). Whether you explore texts from China or readings from 1890’s by Sir Henry Head and Sir Charles Sherrington, you’ll find a discussion of how our feet are connected to energy meridians and nervous system. When you get a foot massage, the points can stimulate various organ systems. I’m completely fascinated that applying pressure on certain areas of your feet can help to diminish your anxiety, fatigue, pain, low back discomfort, postpartum depression, enhance the quality of your sleep, affect your immune function and even vital signs before a surgery. I do this every morning before getting dressed. If that doesn’t appeal to you, much of the literature suggests that foot massage in the evening is a very useful relaxation technique. You will begin by carefully massaging your feet — I like pressing the areas that are tired and tense and especially prone to holding stress. You should rub between your toes, and stretch the area by pushing your fingers between the toes. Believe it or not, there are even special toe stretchers available. Many of us wear uncomfortable shoes that push toes together. This is a way to hold in your stress as well. I was taught that looser and more flexible feet mean more relaxed nervous system. Admire your feet, remember how hard they work for you. One word of caution — when you apply oils or creams to the soles of your feet, they become slippery. So please remember to put socks or slippers on. Questions: What is your favorite and most effective self-care/ relaxation technique? Do you have a good oil or cream that can help your tired feet?

"On Smash Brothers, the most passionate of love stories.","For those of you who don’t know me, a brief bio:I’m pushing 30, and in the past year, I’ve moved a few hours away from my home town, gotten married, and about a week ago, my wife and I had our first child. I guess the reason that stuff is relevant, is because I’m essentially saying that I’m an ‘adult’. That being said… I have a passion for a video game. A real, in-depth passion. A type of passion that gives me the chills as I write this sentence. On the surface, that’s pretty strange, and I absolutely understand that it seems that way, so let me delve further. I grew up playing video games very casually. My neighbors had a Super Nintendo, and we had an NES and eventually got a Sega Genesis. So games have always been present. But to be a 30-year-old man with a family, it’s different to have a passion over something as trivial as a fighting game featuring Nintendo characters. I realize it, too, it’s definitely strange…but I hope this will explain it to you guys, and hopefully some family members who assuredly are waiting for me to ‘grow up’… whatever the hell that entails. Growing up, I struggled pretty badly with anxiety. Panic attacks, fainting at school…and without much merit. I had a great childhood, no trauma or anything scarring- just a nervous/anxious/uncomfortable person. The only thing that keeps me from thinking myself into a crippling panic attack is keeping my mind busy. When I’d get really ‘in my head,’ you’d notice me go on ridiculous reading fits. Multiple books at a time, reading throughout the night. It took me out of my head and into the author’s. Pretty standard stuff, nothing new, all a very common attributes of anxiety. But everything changed when I started playing Super Smash Brothers Melee back in about 2002, around the time when it came out. My brother in law took me to Game Zone, a local game store that’s still there to this day and bought me a GameCube. I got Melee a few months later and played it casually for years, and that was the extent of it until a few years ago when the newest one came out for the Nintendo Wii U. Trying not to bore you all to death, the game is basically a chess match. If I do X, he’ll do Y, then I can do Z. Its an insanely complex game once broken down. To the point where I have almost 400 hours into one character and I’m still pretty bad at the game. I’ve done pretty well at some local tournaments, but I’m by no means a prodigy or future professional player (they exist, top level smash players make hundreds of thousands of dollars a year through sponsors, streaming on the internet and tournament winnings.) But to me, it’s a release. It takes me out of my head and gives me something to strive for and to think on. Smash is philosophy, reason, logic, art and theory all tied together with a crisp bow of reaction time and conscious effort. I know that sounds extreme and immature and overstated, but to me it’s not. The game doesn’t rely on memorized combos like Street Fighter or Tekken or Mortal Kombat does, Smash is a freestyle rap battle. Make things up on the fly, be optimal, read your opponent, force them into doing something you want them to. Skill can only take you so far, and then it becomes a mind game. It’s absolute fluidity from my fingertips. It’s bliss. I’ve played some of the best players in Arizona and I’ve at least kept the games respectable, and that’s an accomplishment that I am so proud of. When I’m not playing the game, I’m thinking about it. Improvements, style, punishing. Watching tutorials on YouTube or international tournaments that feature top players from 6 continents. During all of this…it’s all time that I’m not thinking about other things. I’m not depressed, nervous or lying in bed thinking about things that will result in bloodshot eyes the next morning. I know this all reads as cliche or silly, but it’s also very true. Smash is embedded into my psyche. It’s the desperate inhale after holding my breath, and the euphoric high afterwards. It’s confidence and security. I guess the last thing I’d like to say is to refrain from judgement. We all have things that get us through. For my father, it’s fishing, for my mother, its going to garage sales, and for me, it happens to be a fighting game with Nintendo characters. Respect whatever that thing may be to someone else, and be happy for them that they’ve found it, because not everyone does. -jime.",2017
New Technology Gives Me Anxiety,"I’m always the first to sign up for beta programs online, but the thought of using a machine to pay for my parking space has me circling downtown ten times just to find an old fashioned meter. Why is the machine so far from the car? What if I break the machine? How many buttons are involved? What about the people behind me, who do this every day and are impatiently waiting? What if it won’t take my money? How many steps do I have to take? What if it doesn’t print the ticket? What if I don’t put the ticket in the right spot and get fined? I have anxiety. Part of that means I hate new and confusing situations with too many steps, especially when I’m out in public. While I can appreciate the end results in terms of time and financial saving, the idea of living in a smart city gives me the chills. I’m the person who still doesn’t use self serve checkouts and would never even consider paying for something using my phone. I’m still adjusting to paywave because no two EFTPOS machines work in the same way. All these people are using technology everywhere, all around me and I feel as if I’m being left behind. As soon as I learn how one thing works, I’m faced with something new, something replacing what I’ve known for years. I always thought it was logical that some older people couldn’t understand how new technology worked, due to the huge generational development gap. But I’m only 30 and already technology has outpaced me. Suddenly things I’ve been doing for over a decade are changing and every day tasks I understood 5 years ago have moved onto a completely different system. I learn new systems and new methods of achieving things online every day, but I can’t manage both that and having the world outside my computer march so rapidly into the same realm. For me, human contact is the most important part of learning something new at a shop or for plotting my way through a technology based application. I want someone there who can answer my questions, not a machine which only has buttons, none of which are usually marked ‘help’. No matter how much technology replaces humans, people will still want a real face there to help them, for them to trust, connect to and make them feel understood. Give me a human face and human understanding and I’ll happily adapt to one piece of technology at a time. Give me a new piece of technology with no instructions, I’ll probably do my best to ignore it until every other person powered option is discontinued. I can’t keep up with the machines. At this point, I don’t think I want to. Originally published at susannahbirch.com on January 28, 2017.",2017
Mental health and social media: friends or foe?,"Social media is addictive, there’s no doubt about it. It’s always the first thing I look at in the morning and often the last thing I look at before I go to sleep. I check in on my social feeds regularly throughout the day… more often than I really should. Social media is both the main way I keep up-to-date with news and with my friends — and I know I’m not alone in these habits. Social media use is at an all-time high; so are cases of anxiety, depression, insomnia… the list goes on. Numerous studies have found that social media usage feeds anxiety and generally makes people feel inadequate. According to research from the University of Essex, many of us suffer from a Fear of Missing Out (FOMO) and a desire to stay continually connected with what others are doing. It was found that people under 30 were more likely to fear they were missing out, which makes sense when you consider that they are the first generation to have grown up with social media and digital technologies. Individuals suffering from FOMO were more likely to have deprived psychological needs (particularly the needs for competence, autonomy and relatedness), and they were more likely to be using social media in general. This does however raise a question — does an increase in social media usage lead to these feelings of deprivation, or do individuals already feeling this way find themselves drawn to social media in order to compare their own life with that of their peers? Yet, things are not always what they seem. It’s also a well-know fact that people share the very best things in their lives on social media, so if you’re passively watching and consuming content on social media it’s likely that you’ll have a very filtered view of reality. Although the case against social media may initially sound gloomy, it does have a positive role to play — both in terms of raising mental heath awareness and helping those who suffer from mental health issues. Social media can help open up a whole new world to people who feel isolated, and allow them to foster friendships and maintain those that they may otherwise have let slide. It can also open individuals up to new ideas and experiences, and generally build resilience. It can also give those who suffer from mental health problems a voice, allowing them to help break down the stigma. Campaigns such as #MedicatedandMighty have helped people to open up and get talking — which in turn helps others to feel less lonely and isolated. Have you ever undertaken a ‘digital detox’? It’s becoming increasingly popular as a way of off-setting some of the negative side effects of social media. Taking a break has been found to have huge benefits, including: This year I have challenged myself to have a day a week (starting with an evening a week) where I completely take a break from social media. As someone who suffers from anxiety, depression and hugely disrupted sleep, I’m interested to see how my ‘detox’ (or breaks) will help. Watch this space!",2017
The Ambiguity of Mental Health,"“Am I lazy or is this Clinical Depression?” “Am I actually this motivated or is this the Generalized Anxiety Disorder?” I don’t know…and a part of me believes I never entirely will. I’ve been treated for Depression since high school. I’ve done the group therapies, aromatherapies, one-on-one therapies, psychiatrist appointments, intensive outpatient care, etc. You name it, I’ve probably done it. The Generalized Anxiety Disorder was diagnosed fairly recently. I’m surprised no one pegged me for it before. In hindsight, it probably wasn’t normal to immediately call myself a failure if I wasn’t doing something productive 24/7. I’ve been described as ambitious. I’d like to think that is a good thing. It typically has a good connotation…but like anything else, too much of anything is a bad thing. Over-exhaustion leads to manic episodes and panic attacks. I wish someone would have told me that the entirety of my freshman year of college. Seeing everyone as competition is great for your resume and overall motivation, but it depletes your self-esteem. Clothes and make-up can help make you appear pretty but it does not nothing for how you feel. Being dependable is considered a fantastic quality…but somehow, I lost my own identity along the way. Somehow, numbness crept into my entire being. Doing what you’re ‘supposed to do’ is praised. Obedience and subordination are taught to be ideal. But what happens when you trust others more than you trust yourself? What happens when you start to believe that everyone else’s needs are more important than your own? What happens when your needs, wants, and desires are simply obsolete? Quick answer: Best case scenario, you have a horrid self-esteem. Worst case scenario, you die by suicide. Does that sound extreme to you? Well, its not. It’s not for people like me. Depression is a monster that I’ve developed Stockholm Syndrome for. It’s abusive and controlling. It leaves me chained to my bed. It whispers insults in my ears. It sucks the enjoyment out of everything. And yet, it’s been with me so long that I’d be lying if I didn’t occasionally feed it. I give it way too much attention when I hide for days on end in my own isolation. There are days that I cradle it as if it’s my lifeline, because in some ways, it’s the most stable aspect in my life. I acknowledge the counterproductive aspect of this. There are moments I cradle the thing that has the ability to kill me; the thing that has attempted to kill me. So why am I depressed? Why am I anxious? A chemical imbalance and a beautiful hit of the genetic lottery. Sure, some events haven’t helped, but that’s the gist of it. Oh, and why am I sharing this? Because I hear you, the people who don’t know about my sickness. I hear the “This generation is just weak”, “Stop being so lazy”, “It’s all in your head”, “You’re not really sick, get over it”, “Stop being so sensitive”, “It’s not that deep”, and so on. I hear you all as I’m balling my eyes out on the bathroom floor as I have another episode. I hear you as I look at all the scars on my forearms and on my thighs. I hear you as I take my medications every single day while I try not to think of myself as a “pill-popper.” I hear you…but do you hear me? I refuse to be ashamed of a genetic disposition that I cannot help. I refuse to be burdened simply because you do not understand. I refuse to be silent.",2017

For further information on OCD, there’s a detailed website by the OCD Foundation. Want to Know More About What Is Anxiety and How to Treat It? Anxiety disorders are differentiated dependent on the form of object or situation that leads to fear, anxiety, or avoidance along with the thought patterns connected with the fear or anxiety. The most frequent phobias are associated with noises (for example, thunderstorms or fireworks). The degree of fear is usually inappropriate to the circumstance and might enable you to prevent common, everyday conditions. There are a number of different kinds of pure anxiety treatment choices. Exposure therapy might be used alone, or it might be conducted as a member of cognitive behavioral therapy. Drug treatments may be used to supply short-term aid, but are most useful when combined with different treatments or support. GAD is easily the most frequent anxiety disorder in primary care. Anxiety can also result in headaches, insomnia, digestive difficulties, and lightheadedness. In the end, the treatment path is based on the reason for the anxiety and the patient’s preferences.

Researchers are also trying to find ways in which stress and environmental elements may perform a position. Massage and aromatherapy have been demonstrated to decrease tension and anxiety. Medicine is not likely to cure anxiety alone, and sometimes even therapy may not give you the comprehensive support you need should youn’t partner it with effective lifestyle changes.",2017
"Still figuring myself out, failing most of the time","Most of the time, it feels like I’m in an endless cycle of self-improvement and self-doubt. Like a sine wave. When I’m on an upswing, I feel great about the things I’m working on, and make actual progress. Then doubt creeps in, or I get overwhelmed and burned out, and I just want to stare at a wall. Generally at the bottom of this cycle I start to introspect what caused the downswing and how I can reduce the impact of these triggers in the future. I start making lists and journaling, and recycle all the approaches and mindsets that have helped in the past. So, here’s just another listicle that I posted on Quora in answer to the question What’s the simplest way to understand myself? Because I think about this stuff way more than I probably should. Write down your fears. Write down your anxieties. Identify your triggers. Confront them. Own them. Bend them to your will. Turn them into strengths. Write down your strengths. Play them up. Use them to get motivated when your fears and anxieties try to keep you down. Talk to yourself. In your head. On paper. Out loud. Figure out how your brain works. How you process ideas. Talk to other people. Your co-workers. Your family. Your friends. Listen to what they say. Write it down. Read it out loud. Talk to yourself about what they said. See how it fits into your worldview. Talk to strangers. Analyze how this makes you feel. Do you feel this way because of your fears and anxieties? People don’t think half the things about you that you think they do. They have their own problems. Try things. Things that make you uncomfortable. Things that are difficult. Things that make you think. Fail. Turn that failure into a lesson. Become better for it. Ignore everything I said. The only one who can discover how to understand you is yourself. https://www.quora.com/Whats-the-simplest-way-to-understand-myself/answer/Matthew-Odle",2017
How to Overcome Trump Induced Anxiety,"I’m writing this for myself, and for anyone else who over the past week has had any type of built up anxiety and panic in regards to the recent actions of the Trump Administration. These next four years are going to be long, rocky, and tremulous. I seriously wish that I could be hopeful and think the best in this situation, but I can’t. I truly can’t. It’s even worse when you are the type of person who is naturally inclined to care and be passionate about the certain things that make this country great. Those certain things are now threatened. There’s a difference between the anxiety that most of us may have leading up to the Trump presidency versus the actual anxiety of him being President. Before, it was all just a thought, a joke; he “wouldn’t be as evil as when he campaigned”. But all of that has been proven false and in only a week. He is dangerous and if you aren’t paying attention, he is a threat to the very constitutional freedoms that we all have. All the braggadocio, the boast of power and wealth, the display of authority, they are all a disguise. Deep down, Trump isn’t who he portrays himself to be. This is a man who is insecure, egotistic, a narcissist, and has daddy issues. This is a man who feared his father and whose first divorce ended because his wife “confided to female friends that Donald had difficulty achieving and maintaining an erection.” This is a man who never truly knew what compassion and love are. This is a man who doesn’t understand any other values besides winning and wealth. This is a man whose entire message, rhetoric and policy are based on one thing…Race. He is dangerous. He is dangerous to not only our democracy but also to our mental health and well-being. It is no surprise that he can single-handedly bring the fall of America and to the ‘democratic tradition’. Just look at his recent Executive Orders. However, it is the fear, distress, and anger across the country that he has whirled up that is a much greater risk. Trump’s narcissism, insecurities and viciousness are intrinsic components of who he is, and they’ve already damaged the world’s wellbeing. An insecure man who is handed power is a very treacherous man. They will seek to cover that insecurity, by any means necessary, even if it is at expense of the very people who they are leading. An insecure man cares nothing other than himself. They see the world only through their ego, no other person, place, or thing matters. American’s across the country are fearful and anxious about what a Trump Presidency could mean for the country. Those growing fears only get larger by the day. This has been the longest week ever, and it is only week one. Many people are experiencing rage, others are experiencing depression, and some are experiencing sorrow. However, many people who are against Trump are experiencing one thing in common…and that is anxiety. Truthfully, whatever I’m feeling right now is an unhealthy mixture of all of the above. The anxiety that comes with Trump isn’t only constrained to U.S. soil but it has gone global. Trump has burrowed deep into our psyches, stimulating anxiety that isn’t confined to the borders of the US, or to those who are the direct targets of his bigotry. The agitation that Trump has caused will be very hard to counter and the reality is, it is only going to get worse. During the campaign trail, a University of Minnesota psychologist, William J. Doherty, wrote a report that stated “Trump’s combative and chaotic campaign has stoked feelings of anxiety, fear, shame, and helplessness, especially in women, gay people, minority groups and nonwhite immigrants, who feel not just alienated but personally targeted by the candidate’s’ message.” But for those groups who are a direct recipient to the hate and fear that he has stirred up, those marginalized groups, the anxiety is even more real as they are direct targets of his hate. From minorities, LGBTQ, women, and refugees, the fear of this group grow with every passing day that he is in office. We are afraid, we are intimidated, and we are uncertain about their place in the country’s future. Angry. Confused. Stressed. Depressed. When people say, “Trump won, get over it”, it is a direct slap in our face. That shows that those same people care nothing about the safety and health of the marginalized groups that Trump is attacking. Those people care nothing about what the U.S. stands for in terms of freedom and equality. We can’t get over it when this man is a direct threat to the physical safety of our communities. This is not normal. The Trump anxiety is real. It has triggered sleeplessness, restlessness, and the feeling of powerless in millions of Americans. Or maybe it’s just me. It’s hard to stay calm in times like this and to not have the anxiety lead to depression. I’m scared; hopefully, I’m not alone. All anxiety is problematic. Donald Trump has caused a collective trauma that is a result of the shared experience of the anxiety and threat to a basic sense of belonging in society. He has caused this in the resistance, as well as in his followers. You may be rattled, you may be afraid, but the only way to fight someone like Trump is to not let our anxieties normalize his presidency. The first step that we must take in overcoming “Trump Anxiety” is to accept the reality. We must accept that this is happening, this is real, and this is no longer a joke. This man is president and to realize that, must be the first step in his resistance. The next step is to create a vision. Create a vision on how to protect things and those that are important to you. The final step is to take action. Take action and resist as citizens rather than feel helpless. The next four years are not going to be easy. There is going to be gas lighting, attacks on progressive agenda’s, institutions will be destroyed, and our equality and freedom will be confronted on a daily basis. These times are going to be emotionally exhausting and deeply traumatic for a lot of us. However, it is imperative that we ALL take steps of “self-care” during the resistance. The following methods are ways and examples to overcome the Trump anxiety and maintain your physical and mental well being during his presidency. I believe this is the single most important thing to do in order to reduce your anxiety. It is to become active and involved in your local community and to get involved. Become a visible force in local politics and community organizations, and not just on Facebook and Twitter. Volunteer, call your local congressmen, attend rallies, protest — do whatever you need to do. Focus your energy on things that you care about by donating or helping organizes, charities, or religious groups. Being active and involved will give you a sense of hope since you are on the frontlines of the resistance. Being a digital marketer, whose career is intrinsically linked to social media, this is a hard one for me to do but all so necessary. Unplug and/or moderate your social media use. With our timelines filled with all things Trump-related, it becomes easy to get stressed out. You don’t have to check Facebook or Twitter every hour. Start with limiting your screen time. Set some time in your day that is limited to social media use. For me, I’ve told myself to only check Facebook after 4 or 5. That way, all things Trump and the preceding anxiety doesn’t affect my day. Use entertainment to escape from reality. Binge watch Netflix, read a book, watch a movie, go to a comedy show, or listen to music. Get some me time in with your own company for a while. I find humor to be the greatest relief to stress and anxiety. Watch your favorite comedy show, The Office is a great choice. Music is also another way to ease the pain of fear. Put your headphones on, tune out the world, and use the vibrations to put you in a better mood. Self-care is always essential; we have to take care of ourselves. Take a step in making changes in your lifestyle and daily life to control anxiety. Some people find meditation or yoga to be successful, some people read poetry or a book, and some people find peace in nature. Go to therapy to get the extra support that you need. Get enough sleep. Exercise to create an outlet for your aggression. Eat well. Get outside. Strengthening connections with families, communities, and organizations are the most important preventive approach to Trump anxiety. We are all in this together and people are desperate for connection and community, now more than ever. Talk to your family; support your friends, because chances are they feel just as vulnerable as you do. The more that we do — the better that we will be. As a society, we must take these steps in order to maintain our mental health during our fight for the next four years. We cannot stop resisting, because that is how democracies fall.

The Biggest Step : Accepting,"Today I took the biggest steps of my entire life. Not only did I seek help for my health, but to reach out to an addiction centre. Now for some of you, you might be thinking at the start of this,“ how is she addicted to a plant, its just a plant”or some of you might of not even expected me to be addicted to anything but after eight years of smoking weed I have finally decided to seek professional help not just for the sake of being addicted, but for my health of getting better. When I was diagnosed with depression I was prescribed medication that changes the chemicals in my brain to balance my emotions, my thoughts and everything that was unbalanced. At the time I thought, “Perfect these are going to make everything better” but little did I know that smoking cannabis and taking anti-depressants plus mood stabilizers automatically cancels out the effect of what the medication is supposed to do in the long run. With hardly any background knowledge behind this all, I have harmed myself more when really I should have been healthy 8 months ago… Its crazy what a certain drug can do to your mind even when you think everything is “okay”. For almost 8 years I coped with cannabis and if I could go back in time and cope differently, I would have. I did anything to help “control” my anxiety and depression but sadly enough, I was to afraid to admit that it wasn’t doing anything for me anymore… if anything I was getting worse by the minute. I never wanted to accept the fact I was addicted, or the fact that it wasn’t making me worse but today I was strong enough to walk through the doors and seek for immediate help. We all are addicted to something that takes away the pain and thats completely normal as human beings. We go through things that might rip us apart, but today I had to remove the thing that took my pain away for eight years because it was no longer doing any justice for myself and my health. Yesterday was my first day being sober in super long time and i couldn’t be more proud of myself. Sometimes I don’t give myself enough credit when achieving something like this, but right now i’m so overwhelmed but a good overwhelming feeling. I have finally overcame my fear of giving up something that I was so attached to and thats a big deal to me. Personally, I never thought I would have to develop an issue like this later on but i’m so glad I did. This entire experience has shown me that your health is the most important thing. Not being in school or having a job right now creates a mixture of feelings for myself, not only because I feel like I failed but the fact that I have to put my entire life on hold to catch up with my healthy self and thats okay. I’m starting to learn to accept everything that i’ve been through and if anything it has sure taught me showed me how strong a human being can really be during times like these. I’m proud of myself not giving up, i’m proud I reached out for help all the times I needed it, i’m proud that I was strong enough through all of this even at my lowest moments. This shows that i’m capable to survive through anything that life throws at me, and that even though I still don’t have a clue what light looks like in this dark tunnel i’m in I will see the light one day. I will see the purpose of all the things I had to do to overcome this struggle and hopefully my life will fall into place with more good than bad.",2017
Stretching Out Your Comfort Zone,"Why did I commit to all these things? What if I’m really tired after work? What if I just don’t feel like it and have to force myself? As if that isn’t enough, I also get anxious about some of the things that accompany going out, and as everyone’s journey is different I thought I’d share some of the biggest things I worry about: I agonize over what will be the “right” thing to wear to fit in, even going to the grocery store. I don’t want to be hot, cold, too formal, too casual, uncomfy, or stared at. Coupled with my weight loss journey (it’s a great thing, but nothing fits the same any more and I’m in that awkward in-between phase of clothing sizes) this means I tip the contents of my wardrobe all over my bed at least twice a week. I greatly look forward to the day where I’ll be able to comfortably fit everything I own, and my goal is to have a wardrobe of things that I can just throw on, look awesome in, and go. I get lost easily, and I am completely fine with this when I’m not on a time deadline to meet someone. I greatly enjoy looking at interesting houses, getting garden ideas, exploring new suburbs, and driving around singing along to music. New places and being on time make me anxious, so I spend time researching where I’m going, being aware of the closest three or four carparks to my destination so that if one is full I have a contingency plan. I never trust my GPS’s time estimates, nor Googles, but I’ll always check both just to be sure. I allow an extra 20 minutes to get anywhere, and have got getting out the door in an extremely short time frame down to an art. I also always have spare clothes in the car if I’m particularly disorganized (see point one). Don’t get me wrong, I’ve spent plenty of time over the years at raves, gigs, and immersed in local music events. However, as time has gone on, my fear of waking up deaf has me panicking about loud, grating noises pretty much everywhere I go. Thankfully, at gigs and events that are designed to be loud I can wear earplugs and still enjoy myself, but places like restaurants and bars with music that you have to shout to have a conversation over just aren’t for me anymore. Equally thankfully, most of my friends know that and some are the same, so suggesting a restaurant change isn’t frowned upon any more. Taking too long to make them, that is. Depending on who I’m with and where I’m out, choosing what to eat can take a looong time. If I’ve been there before, great! I know their portion sizes and have at least one thing I know I’m willing to eat, so the pressure is off. If I haven’t been there, the menu is usually about six pages long and I’m going to blindly hope that my fellow table-mates will take their time so I can madly compile a shortlist in my head. Same goes for drinks. Even worse is when everyone finally orders, the menus are taken away, and then the waitress comes back to let me know they’ve run out of what I’ve ordered, making me re-choose in about 16 seconds. Thank god for foodie friends. The last one on this list is pretty general. As an example, I signed up to be a volunteer usher a few months ago for some theatre events. I’d never been an usher before, but thankfully have seen enough of them over the years that I had a good idea of what the job entails. Everyone I was volunteering for was lovely, and the job ended up being a piece of cake. I deal with drunk, sick, and confused people in my day job, so have enough skills equipped to be able to deal with conflict or drama if it arises, which was able to put my mind mostly at ease. Thankfully my shift was uneventful, but I spent a lot of time making sure I didn’t accidentally strangle myself with my headset or trip down the stairs just to be sure. I picked the most common of the things that cause me angst, and as time goes on will share the strategies I learn to combat them. I’d love to know what kinds of things make you anxious, if you’re willing to share. ❤",2017
Sitting on the bank of the river,"When overwhelmed with thoughts, take a deep breath and try imagining yourself sitting on the bank of a river, firmly rooted to the spot in a comfortable seat. Imagine these thoughts are flowing though the river, watch them pass by without jumping in and grappling with them. Stay firmly rooted to the spot, label each thought as it passes by: is it an angry thought? a sad thought? a ‘what if?’ or a ‘I should have’? Acknowledge it is there in your mind, but flowing though it, like debris in a river which doesn’t have to be picked out and grappled with. The more you are able to stay still, acknowledge thoughts as they pass by whilst maintaining a stable footing in the present the stronger you will feel. Sometimes the thought may need addressing, but instead of jumping in and getting washed downstream, address it with a rationale, balanced outlook by identifying what you can actually do about it and at what point you need to just let it flow past. Easier said then done, so is there anything that you need to draw upon whilst on the bank of the river? Call a friend, use a breathing technique? Put on your favourite music? Take yourself off for a run? Draw up a to-do list? Good luck, the more your sitting firmly and acknowledging your discipline the better you will become at managing your anxieties.",2017
What matters most is your state of being.,"Slowly I realized, if I put some efforts into creating positive experiences that make me feel free, abundant, and joyful, I could also be courageous and unafraid. This deliberate conditioning process, if carefully carried out, would slowly allow me to redefine myself and prevent me from denying my ability and potential to be who I want to be, bold, adventurous, and unhesitant. How are you feeling today? As you are feeling this way, are you drawing conclusions about yourself? I’m careless. I’m stupid. I’m awkward. I can’t get things done, blah blah blah. When you are thinking these thoughts? What is your state of being? Are you worried, sad, paranoid, or frustrated? “You are not you when you are hungry.” Borrowing this tagline, I want to remind you that you are not you when you are experiencing negative emotions. Or at least that is not all you could be. Take a walk, pet your dog, water your plants or even eat a cookie. These small actions can help change your state of being and pull you out of the spiral of darkness when you let them. Sometimes I find it funny that a cookie can make me think life is great when five seconds earlier, I felt like I was borderline suicidal. Noticing your state of being also comes in handy when you are trying to make a decision. Are you making it when you are feeling content and peaceful, or anxious and scared? Are you going to like your decision if it was made when you were not the best version of yourself? Smart people learn to monitor and exercise control over their states of being, so they can be the best versions of themselves when something is demanded from them. The first step, is simply to notice.",2017
Parts of My Life I Miss the Most,"Last month I wrote about how bipolar disorder had cost me — well, not the ability — but the capacity to read (http://wp.me/p4e9Hv-qp). I am intensely thankful that the concentration, focus, and motivation to read have returned as my healing has progressed. But there are some other things that are missing from my life that I wish desperately that I could get back. Or wish I had never lost in the first place. (Depression is very much with me right now, so forgive me if I dwell in the past with my failures a bit.) First are friends. I’ve written about this before too (http://wp.me/p4e9Hv-2W), but the subject was brought home to me recently when I received a fuck-off letter from a former friend I was trying to reach out to, in hopes of reestablishing the relationship. One of her main reasons for cutting me off was that every time we went out, she felt it was “her and me and my misery.” She did acknowledge that at times our friendship had been burdened by her misery too, but evidently that either didn’t count as much, or else mine lasted too long. (If it was too long for her, it was even longer for me.) I am very disappointed that, now that my “black dog” is smaller and on a leash, she found other reasons not to associate with me. To make it more ironic, she has been a therapist and now teaches psychology. I also miss having a steady paycheck. My last 9–5 office job was over ten years ago, and since then my mental state has not allowed me to get and keep another such position. The security of knowing how much money I would have every month allowed me to plan. And to travel. I really miss traveling. Admittedly, part of my inability to travel now is determined by my physical health. But my anxiety would make it just that much more difficult. Now I can barely get away for a weekend, and even then I must carefully monitor my moods, limit my activities, track my eating and sleeping, and avoid crowds. One of my deepest regrets is that when I was undiagnosed and untreated, I couldn’t fulfill my potential. I attended an Ivy League university, but I can’t say I got out of it what I could or should have. I feel now that I skated by, impeded by many depressive spells, lack of focus and concentration, and confusion. I even took a year off to get my head together, but since that didn’t include getting help for my bipolar disorder, its value was questionable. Lest this seem like nothing but whining (which my depression is telling is what it is), there are also some things that bipolar disorder has taken from me that I don’t miss at all. Oddly, one of them is a 9–5 office job. While I do miss the steady paycheck, I absolutely don’t miss the things that came with it. Now, doing freelance work, I can fit my work around the things I need to do (like seeing my therapist) and the things I have to do (like slowing down when depression hits). I don’t have to get up at the same time every day and dress appropriately (if at all) and try to fit in and socialize with my co-workers. That was never easy for me and became nearly impossible after my big meltdown. And, as much as I miss travel, I don’t miss business travel. Again, being “on” all the time, for days at a time, with no time or place to decompress, would be impossible now. Since we usually had to share hotel rooms, there wasn’t even a chance for any alone time, which I need a fair amount of. I could never get the hang of “team eating” either. Finally, I don’t miss the boyfriend who took an already broken me and broke me worse. (I wrote about him in my post about gaslighting http://wp.me/p4e9Hv-pm.) My self-esteem was not great before the relationship, but afterward it went into negative numbers. Self-harm, self-medication, self-doubt, and negative self-talk were what I had instead. But Rex didn’t do it alone. He had my bipolar disorder there to reinforce his words and actions. And to not let me see what was happening. Bipolar disorder is a balancing act, in more ways than one. It takes away good things from our lives. But my therapist reminds me that it also gives an opportunity — as I rebuild my life, I can choose which pieces I want to reclaim and which I want to discard. And the parts I can rebuild are what I should concentrate on. And I will, once this spell of depression releases me.",2017

Setting Boundaries 101,"Originally published at stronginsideout.com on January 30, 2017. At Camp Nerd Fitness this year, I found myself bringing up the importance of boundaries during every single workshop I taught. It’s a constant through-line with my coaching clients and Bootcamp members as well. They apply to almost every person I work with because many of the reasons people seek me out for help have to do with a disconnect from one’s inner voice. Boundaries are a radical, loving way to reconnect with your inner voice and stand up for your needs. I had no idea what boundaries were before last year. I had heard of them, but I’d never done any kind of personal work with them. Because of the lack of boundaries, I found myself constantly drained by giving too much of my time or energy, or in contrast, pushing others away for fear of disappointing them by having to say no. When I started actively setting boundaries for myself, my confidence sky-rocketed. Not only did setting the boundary act as a way to stand up for myself and my worth, but my boundaries allowed me to open up even MORE to my loving relationships. I was able to be more present around people I used to be endlessly cautious around because I knew that if they were to cross a boundary, I would know exactly how to reset it in a loving way. Developing loving boundaries also allowed me to start using my voice, something that I was never comfortable doing before. What I realized was that, pre-boundaries, I had been constantly on edge because I didn’t know what was worth speaking up about and what wasn’t. I ended up defaulting to silence, holding onto resentments, regrets and shame for not being “stronger.” Now that I know myself better, I don’t waste energy on the things that don’t really matter. I act more boldly and I use my voice when necessary. Because setting boundaries has been utterly life-changing for me, I’m hoping to help you get started setting some for yourself. Today’s article is devoted entirely to getting to know the boundaries that matter to you, and the basics of how to set them. We’re going over Boundary Setting 101. Don’t spend one more second spread too thin for lack of boundaries. Let’s dive in and explore boundaries that make sense for you! The first step of this process is determining where you need to set loving boundaries. To help you do that, I’ve put together a few prompts to help you explore. The prompts above help you explore the areas of your life that require boundaries to be set. When you’re done journaling through them, move on to identify what’s holding you back. Considering the prompts you just worked through, ask yourself what the limiting factors are that keep you in this space of misalignment. These prompts may help you: Let’s work through a couple of examples together. 1st Prompt: When do you feel uncomfortable, drained or out of alignment? Example Answer: When I stay at work late because there’s so much to get done. 2nd Prompt: What keeps you from feeling at peace, energized or aligned in these areas of your life? Example Answer: Long work days that I didn’t sign up for, or expectations around the amount of work I’m supposed to do. 1st Prompt: What practices are important to you? Example Answer: Running 20 minutes, 3 days a week to clear stress from my body. 2nd Prompt: What keeps you from prioritizing the practices and self-care that are important to you? Example Answer: Commitments to pick up my daughter from school, errands I have to run after work. After working through these prompts, you’ll be able to see clear as day what’s holding you back from feeling in alignment with the life you want. This is where we work from to set loving boundaries. Move on to the next step to learn how! Now that you know what areas need boundaries, you’re going to answer a set of similar prompts that will help you outline exactly which boundaries need to be made. Using your answers from the above sections, move on to journal your way through these: Using the examples I offered in the last section, here are a few boundaries I might come up with: This part of the boundary process takes brainstorming and exploration of what you feel comfortable with. There’s no right or wrong. In the end, you determine what’s more important: setting the boundary or not. If you want to move forward with setting these boundaries, let’s talk a bit about how to set them lovingly. Many of us have experiences in our pasts that taught us not to stand up for ourselves unless it gets really bad. We learn that “sucking it up” is a sign of strength, or that we have to suffer to get ahead in life. It’s my belief that neither of those things are true. In fact, I believe that strength is taking the hard action: standing up for what you really need to feel aligned with what you want in life. Sucking it up is the easy, people-pleasing way out. If you agree that “sucking it up” is for the birds and that standing up and speaking out is where strength lies, then let’s move forward with a few tips on setting loving boundaries. If your boundaries require more of a commitment from yourself than others, it may help to write them down for yourself and put them somewhere you can read them regularly. The most important part of writing them down is that you include the WHY behind them. Seeing them in black and white will help remind you why these boundaries are so important, which is especially helpful if you start sliding back into old habits. You might also consider telling someone else about these new boundaries. I suggest opening up to a trusted friend, spouse, therapist or coach about why you want to set these new boundaries and how you plan to do so. Just saying your intention out loud is a powerful thing, plus sharing it with someone who supports you can help you feel like it’s more “real” than if you keep it to yourself! When your boundaries require that you have a chat with someone directly, do yourself (and them) a favor: make sure it’s in a private place where you two can be alone. If that’s uncomfortable for you because of the boundaries you need to set, do some brainstorming as to who you would feel comfortable with asking to be there. As much as possible, try to choose someone that won’t automatically trigger the person you’re setting boundaries with. If you’re at work, you might consider a manager, supervisor or HR person. If it’s in your personal life, you might consider booking a therapy session for the both of you so that you can have someone mediate the emotions that might come up. Whenever possible, use “I statements” to illustrate your point. It is never a person’s fault that you feel a certain way or take on more than you feel comfortable with. We must accept responsibility for what we have not said in the past. Blaming others most often causes others’ defenses to go up causing them to be unable to actually hear what you’re saying. For example, if I were setting a boundary about how many extra tasks I can take on at work, I might say something along the lines of: “I’ve found that when I take on too many extra tasks makes me inefficient in all areas of my life including work. While I’d love to help with 2 extra tasks per month, taking on more than that is overwhelming for me.” NOT, “You give me too much work and it overwhelms me. Can’t you see I’ve got too much on my plate?” or “I’ve been saying yes too often for too long and Janice doesn’t do half as much work as I do. Why don’t you ask her?” Stick to your side of the fence, and the person you’re setting boundaries with will be more likely to be receptive to them. While doing so much work on ourselves, it’s easy to forget that people around us can be triggered just as easily as we can! When setting boundaries, we may trigger others by accident. If you trigger someone, they may react in a variety of ways: with anger, guilt-tripping, aggression, etc. These reactions are not a reflection of who you are. They are signs of their own pain and journey, not your wrong-doing. While they may be reacting in a way that triggers us right back, we have the choice to breathe deeply into the reason why we are standing up for ourselves, and protect our energy with this exercise. It’s difficult to stand your ground when someone is crumbling or raging in front of you, but for your own sake, you must. This is the ultimate lesson in self-confidence; to stand up for your needs even when someone else (whose opinion you care about) doesn’t like it. You weren’t put here to please others. You’re not here to compromise your emotional safety and happiness so that you can make their lives easier. You’re here to experience life as you choose to experience it.

Resilience not reactivity: Handling fear in the age of Trump,"I’ve been seeing a lot of shares and likes of this post this morning. It’s a well-written article by a very smart man that makes some predictions about what could happen in the near future. It is a futurist prediction that is worth considering, but is it something worth investing a lot of precious emotional energy in? I don’t think so. Let’s discuss why. Should we believe this guy? You can take a look at the author’s bio here. He’s a theoretical physicist and an engineer who has done some undergraduate and graduate work in history. He has never served in the military, held a government position, or done advanced work in political science (that he mentions). He’s simply a deeply intelligent person making a futuristic prediction based on study, but not personal experience. OK, should we ignore this, then? Not at all. It’s important that we keep our minds open to all possibilities. So we should be terrified. Again, no. It is simply a prediction. One of many possibilities along a broad specturm, written by someone who is quite literally guessing based on his own intelligence and study. But this article scares me. It is normal to feel afraid, unsettled, angry, and a whole range of other negative emotions. If you didn’t, I might question if you were paying attention. But I know you are. What you’re feeling is a heightened anxiety response. Your body is flooding with stress hormones like adrenaline and cortisol that make it difficult for you to think rationally. These are the hormones that trigger the “fight or flight” response. This is by design. Some very intelligent, very dangerous people want you to feel this way. The media wants you to feel this way. Certain friends and acquaintances want you to feel this way. Fear and anxiety drive clicks. Trump advisor Steven Bannon, who built a media empire out of fear, anger, and anxiety knows this intimately. Got it. Panic and fear is bad. Very bad. Most of America right now is in a cycle of panic and reaction. As long as Bannon, et. al. keep creating “crisis events,” such as the intentional chaos caused by the Executive Order on immigration issued Friday, people will be kept in a constant state of reactivity, which will prevent a coherent resistance from forming. We will essentially be throwing darts at a moving target and running around reacting to every new crisis as they create them. But the panic and fear is overwhelming me. Understandable. I have lived with severe anxiety disorder since I was a child and it’s one of the most unpleasant sets of emotions there is. That is why it is so critical to develop strategies to control your emotions and stress (I will write more specifically about this soon). For now, sit with your fear and discomfort for a minute, and then think it through before you respond to it. Have a drink, a snack, or a nap. Listen to some soothing music or play with your pets. The problem will still be there fifteen minutes from whenever you started to feel panicky. Once you have your emotions in check, you can think critically about whatever it is that set you off, including scary articles on the Internet. I feel a little better now. Great! But wait…now that the emotional crisis has passed, there’s more you can do to center and secure yourself. As an activist, a movement leader, or just a concerned citizen, the most important thing you can do for yourself and for the resistance is to develop emotional and physical resilience. Why resilience? Because the future rarely takes the shape we anticipate, we need to be prepared for a wide range of possibilities. We must not allow ourselves to focus on one possibility to the exclusion of others. If we do, we may find we prepared for the wrong thing and are completely at a loss as to how to respond to what has actually happened. How do I develop resilience? A large part of anxiety is actually not anticipating the future. It is anticipating how we will respond to the future. One way to develop emotional resilience is to remember times in the past when you faced adversity and you overcame it. Repeat this exercise often enough, and you will build trust in your ability to respond to a crisis. Anything else? Yes. Remember that your emotions belong to you and no one else. Trust your brain, not your stress hormones, to signal when you’re being emotionally manipulated. Instead of posting and re-posting articles like the above with expressions of fear and terror, share them as an FYI, something to be aware of, and then carry on with your movement work. Focus on acting, not reacting. And take care of yourself. In peace and solidarity…",2017
Stop Worrying Start Living — 7 Practical Tips to Overcome Worries,"In this article let me share with you 7 practical tips to overcome worries. I strongly believe these tips will help you better cope with anxiety. Feel free to use the self-help worksheets I’ve made available below. (you can get a pdf version of this article here) Worrying is a topic I am particularly interested in for several reasons, first, I used to be worried about a lot of insignificant events and secondly I know how destructive worry can be to your health. I believe that the main reason why my father had a heart attack ten years ago was actually because of stress (thankfully he is fine now). He wasn’t fat, wasn’t smoking, was exercising on a regular basis and wasn’t drinking alcohol more than the average person but had a strong tendency to worry. Of course, genetics probably played a role too. Just as I am writing this article I remember a story he told me about a doctor who seemed to imply that he was responsible for this situation. At that time I thought the doctor was being pretty unfair to him; he was taking care of his health pretty well and after all it wasn’t his fault if he had a stressful job, right? But think about it for a while. How do you define a stressful situation? What is stress? Do you not have some control over it? Stress is only the result of your interpretation of an event and does not exist by itself,which means that you are responsible for you stress. A situation is not stressful in itself. Does it mean you can totally get rid of stress? Probably not. However you can reduce significantly your stress and your worries by having a better understanding of what stress is. When we deal with our emotions, the first thing to do is to accept them completely. The common belief is that we should not repress our emotions. We should let off the steam. However, the reality is that, yelling at someone, pounding a punching ball or venting to your friend, rather than helping you, will only exacerbate your anger. The more you experience an emotion, the more you reinforce the connections associated with that emotion in your brain. Actually, accepting your emotions doesn’t mean you have to let off the steam. What you have to do is to become aware of your emotions, act as an external observer trying to analyze what is going on and accept it. “Okay, so now I have a feeling of anger. It’s okay. Why do I feel that way? What was the root cause, Can I let go of that emotion now?” To learn more about how to let go of your emotions I highly recommend that you read The Sedona Method by Hale Dwoskin. We usually say « I am angry », « I am worried », or « I am depressed » but you should realize that you are not your emotions. By changing the words you are using when you talk to yourself you can detach yourself from your emotions and empower yourself. After realizing you are worrying, instead of saying « I’m worried » you could say for instance something like « Okay, so I choose to think in a certain way that causes me to experience a feeling that I would label as « worry » ». By refusing to use « I am » you will stop associating yourself with your negative emotions and stop making them part of your identity. As a result, you will feel more empowered, will be able to analyze more objectively your emotions and to better cope with those emotions. By increasing our level of awareness you will understand and accept that worries are useless. You might say: “wait a minute Thibaut! Stress helps me take action and perform better. If stress exists it is for a reason right?” Well. Some people like Denis Waitley in his book The Psychology of Winning argue that stress is necessary and help us perform better but I believe they are talking more about stress before a performance. Feeling a certain amount of stress before a big event is a normal thing but worrying about something a week before it will happen or about a thing that might never happen is a waste of time and energy. I’m sure stress was necessary for our survival thousand of years ago when we were half-naked in the jungle surrounded by all kinds of dangers but nowadays a great majority of situations are not a matter of life or death anymore. Most of our negative thoughts are thus useless in our modern society. One of the problems is that we believe worrying is necessary. We subconsciously believe that by worrying we are doing something to solve the problem. Worrying has never solved any problems. Worrying like any other emotions is only a signal telling you to wake up and take some actions. I will repeat myself because it is very important that you understand that worrying is useless. It is not helping you in anyway and it might seriously be negatively affecting your health. Take a minute to consider this, when in your past has worrying seriously helped you in any way? Can you think of any such situations? How many times did you worry over something that never even came to fruition? Make sure the things you are worrying about are really legitimate. Let me quote Earl Nightingale, a famous American motivational speaker to illustrate my point: « Let me show you how much time we waste in worrying about the wrong problems. Here is a reliable estimate of things people worry about: Things that never happen 40%, things that are over and past and that can never be changed by all the worry in the world 30%, needless worries about our health 12%, petty miscellaneous worries 10%, really, legitimate worries 8%. In short, 92% of the average person worries take a valuable time, cause painful stress even mental anguish, and are absolutely unnecessary. » Similarly, the Stoics emphasized the need to sort out things depending on whether you have total control, some control, or no control at all over them. Things you have total control over include the goals you are setting for yourself. Things you have some control over include the outcome of an event such as a tennis game. Things you have no control over are things like the weather, the economy, the politics, the past and so on. For every ailment under the sun, There is a remedy, or there is none; If there be one, try to find it If there be none, never mind it. Mother Goose This idea comes from the book by Dale Carnegie How to Stop Worrying and Start Living, an awesome book that I highly recommend that you read it. The idea is pretty simple yet powerful.Best ideas are often the simple ones but the key is to practice. Small anecdote: when I ordered a copy of this book for my father and asked him if he read it he said he did. I said to him it is not a novel, you shouldn’t read it only one; you should read it again and again, and practice. He probably didn’t Living in day-tight compartments means we should do one thing at a time with the best of our abilities, one day at a time. As far as I know we cannot change the past and we cannot predict the future. It is a very simple idea but it is very easy to forget! Live in the present and think as if today was the only thing you have. Personally, I try to plan my day as much as I can and to be clear on what I want to accomplish this week, this month and this year. When we have clear plans for our future we don’t need to worry that much about the future anymore. We only need to review our plans from time to time. Then, what I do is that I delegate tomorrow’s tasks to my future me and trust he would get the job done. By doing that, I can better focus on the present. When you are worrying there are in reality only a few actions you can take: Once you have identified what are your legitimate worries ask yourself the following question: what is the worst thing that can possibly happen? And prepare yourself mentally until you accept it. Then, starting from that, try to do what you can to solve the problem. Preparing yourself mentally will generate a sort of relief since once you have accepted the worse case scenario you cannot worry any more than that. Though the ultimate goal of each person on this planet is to be happy, it is surprising to see how few people actually study happiness and understand it. By understanding how happiness works it is possible to significantly reduce worry, but for that a conscious effort is required. It is a constant theme of my blog, unless we are willing to open our mind to new ideas, challenge our existing beliefs, and practice consciously, we will never change. Personal development is about increasing awareness. Our mind is constantly tricking us, making us believe that if we fail to land that job we strive, date that girl we are dreaming of, or buy that house we really want, we will be miserable. This is bullshit! In that regard, a famous study on lottery winners and paraplegics was very eye-opening for me. This study conducted in 1978 aimed at evaluating the impact on happiness of the following events: winning the lottery or becoming a paraplegic. The results showed that one year after the event, both groups were as happy as they were before the events. Wow! How cool is that? Take a few minutes to really think about it. After pondering about it, I felt a kind of relief realizing that even if I were to experience terrible accidents it wouldn’t really affect my level of happiness. I think there is a general misconception about happiness. Indeed, we all have a predetermined level of happiness. Some people are naturally happier than others. Fortunately, it can be changed. According to Sonja Lyubomirsky (check her great book:The How of Happiness: A New Approach to Getting the Life You Want) 50% of our happiness is determined by genetics, 40% by internal factors and only 10% by external factors! (Such as whether we are married or single, rich or poor, smart or stupid…). It means that, as you might already know, it is impossible to increase significantly our happiness by focusing on external factors such as money, need for approval, fame and so on. It might take time and effort to fully realize it but the more we become aware of how happiness works and how our brain wonderfully adapts to any situation, the more we can release the pressure we are putting on ourselves, and get rid of worries about our future. It gives us more room to focus on doing what we can in the present to improve our situation. – Take a pen and a piece of paper.

Some public words that I’ll probably regret,"What is anxiety. It’s hard to explain but here’s how it is for me… It’s when your body starts to tingle in an uncomfortable way, you feel restless and agitated, but don’t have any idea why. The feeling starts in your gut, or hands, or feet, or chest…and spreads quicker than you expect, every time. You feel like you need to scream and run as fast as you can. Not run away, just run to get the feeling to stop, but you can’t because it’s coming from inside you. It’s when you can’t hear the person talking to you because your mind is spinning so fast, calculating and criticising. How you’re standing, how you’re holding your hands, why is your voice cracking, stop stuttering, you’re making too much eye contact, now you look disinterested, now you’re rambling, stop interrupting them, it’s endless. They don’t become a friend. It’s because you’re strange and too nerdy, you didn’t perform well enough. It’s definitely not because you struggle to connect with anyone because you’re too busy performing and trying to survive. It’s when you’re happy that you had a great date, or went to a nice party, but you’re up until 5am because your brain needs to go over every detail, good or bad, until you can’t tell what really happened and what you just made up. You manage to sleep for a couple of hours, but it takes over a week to recover the energy that a simple social interaction stole from you. It’s when you think you’ve had bad asthma since you were 11 when you were actually having panic attacks. At least now you know why the inhalers never worked. It’s when you’ve never had a serious relationship with anyone, even though you’ve had plenty. It’s when you date someone for a year and feel nothing when it’s over, but are full of grief when a stranger leaves after a week. The feelings were never for the other person, you were too busy being lost in your own head, unable to listen, unable to bond. It’s when you injure your neck, shoulders, or hands every few weeks because the constant tension in your body made the muscles turn to stone. You think you just have severe RSI that lasts for years, but leaving the computer alone for months doesn’t change a thing. It’s when you don’t work for three months, then six months, then nine. You’re trying to get better but you keep disappointing the few people that still have any expectations of you. You fail to keep any of the promises you’ve made, which you know you could do easily if you weren’t so damn useless. It’s when you don’t leave the house because someone might notice you and see that you don’t belong. Then you don’t leave your room because you might get in the way and that’s unacceptable. Then you can’t leave your bed, or move, because someone might hear and realise your down there, hiding. It’s when you know you’re not suicidal, but you wish you could just fade away and not exist anymore. I’m slowly getting better. Therapy helps. So did medication for a while. I now work for a few hours a week on the projects I promised so long ago, and I don’t make new promises. I’m still exhausted by simple interactions but at least I’m out in the world more. I’ve learned to meditate to calm the restless itch that invades my body, it works most days, but some days it doesn’t. I‘m starting to connect with new people, it’s slow but I’m getting there. Please keep any comments positive, you don’t know who might be reading them.",2017

One daily thing you can do at work when you have a mental illness,"There are lots and lots of lists out there that have good and quality motivating angles. ‘These seven things will help.’ ‘Five things celebrity does before…’ ‘Hack life for the ultimate so-and-so…’ I’ve never been big on lists, much to my detriment, but when I see these sorts of write-ups, I feel like they’re telling me what I want to hear (well, of course they are because they engaged with me!) and that they offer some kind of summarised notion of how things could be if I just used those quick tips. Okay, obvious points aside, what I’ve found to be a gap is hearing from those who’ve just needed one small thing to get them through the day while at work. Just a small thing to reduce the anxiety building up prior to a presentation, or the wall of tears about to burst because you’re worried your analysis is shit and you’ll lose your job because of it. Something that reminds you that you’re…capable. Even if you’re just making a coffee. Especially if you’re making a coffee and you live in Melbourne, the home of coffee connoisseurs. For a long time, my mental health was in such a state that I was experiencing all of the above and generally all at once, especially the coffee-making thing. I would spend nights worrying about days at work, and when that was over, I’d go home and avoid my wife and daughter, just trying to get some quiet headspace time. As you can imagine, it went about as good as this: http://www.gifbin.com/bin/082015/1438623013_fireworks_showoff_fail.gif ‘Cuz baby you’re a firework!’ I was/am classic Borderline; I couldn’t regulate emotions, avoided all social situations while trying to be validated, and cried. Cried lots. Never finished anything because WHAT’S THE POINT? Nobody cares. I’d let people tell me how to do my job because it was easier than trying to show why it wouldn’t work, and so on… And how the hell am I going to get through a list of 10 things I can do while at work, when I can’t even focus on ONE BLOODY THING? FURY! ANGER! so. many. tears. It doesn’t take much to start feeling anxious, especially if you’ve never really had the internal belief that you are capable, and that the way you’re feeling can be overcome with some quality therapy (and meds, too, if required because sometimes au naturale is fucking impossible). I better get to the point before I start reliving this stuff without moving on! Yikes! Being at work is incredibly tough when you are experiencing anxiety or depression, and when it’s not entirely obvious to those around you that your inner self is currently fighting the world’s biggest fight of bad vs good, it can make you feel extremely isolated. So, if you do this ‘one weird trick I read on the internet’ — okay it’s not from the internet and it’s not weird and definitely not a trick or a hack. Breathe. I’m not talking about the slight breath you get from just sitting there looking at your screen all day, worried about how your desk hunch is going to fuck your hips. Catch yourself right at that moment when things are bleak and you’re not sure how to do anything, and take a big-ass breath, the kind you take when you dive underwater and try to outlast your friend in a totally competitive way. Yeah! You fuckin’ won that contest! Exhale. Exhale like you mean it. Push all that crappy air out. Repeat. Then do it all again. Go and do it in the bathroom if you need to. Just sit there, breathing. Just take it all in. Let it all out. Take it all in. Let it all out. Whoooooooa the hokey pokey. That’s partially what it’s all about. Why? Because if you can do that one thing when you feel anxiety coming on, it will help to calm you down. It’s just one coping strategy I found to be most effective for me, only after a lot of practice and a lot of failed attempts and a lot of giving up. Mainly giving up or forgetting in the moment. Okay just giving up. I’m not going to provide any science tips or psychology links because, honestly, you guys know this already, and you know that mental illness can’t be cured by one daily trick or hack; rather, a combination of exercises such as the above, ongoing therapy, HOBBIES and meds (if required) will help contribute to not only a more productive life at work, but also a rewarding life at home. IT TAKES PRACTICE. Don’t kid yourselves. Don’t try it once and go ‘yeah that’s awesome’ and then stop doing it when it you need it most. Mental health and recovery doesn’t work like that. It’s ongoing. It’s painful as all hell. It makes you sad, and it makes you want to stop. But you have to keep going…and when you breathe, the almost very bare minimum action you can take that’s already happening anyway, you at least give yourself the chance to do that. Just breathe deeper. Just one thing you can do.",2017
Understanding Anxiety — This Is How It Feels,"Anxiety is waking in the middle of the night with a pounding heart, in sheer panic, with an intense feeling of having forgotten to do something. It is trying to control your breath and slow your heart to go back to sleep, knowing you’ll be awake again far too soon. Anxiety is waking in the morning with a sense of foreboding and dread. It’s wanting nothing more than to hide in bed and not face the world, but knowing that your racing mind wouldn’t let you relax even if you did. Anxiety is an icy hand clasping your heart and squeezing. It’s a rock that has been placed on your chest, that you are powerless to remove. Anxiety is having tiny, shrunken lungs that can never take in enough air. It is the shallow, rapid breathing of an asthma attack but one that no inhaler can relieve. Anxiety is cold sweat on your forehead and shaking hands. It is the feeling of being disconnected from your body and the world, swirling in a mist of confusion. It is a constant battle against the whirl of thoughts. Trying to think straight and concentrate is like trying to pick out grains of sand from a tornado. Click here to continue reading…",2017
Take On Too Much Disorder: Time to Relax,"One of my favorite pastimes is perusing WebMD for a new illness or disorder I didn’t know I had. Other than comparing each and every mole on my body to their cancerous photo gallery, my next favorite use of WebMD is trying to decipher what is wrong with my brain. This week, I have concluded that while I show a lot of Bipolar or Generalized Anxiety Disorder tendencies, I truly am in a land of my own. I have Take On Too Much Disorder or TOTMD. What are the symptoms of such a specific disease, you ask? Let me tell you. Let’s just say, the last couple of weeks have been a TOTMD spiral around here. Some of my spinning wheels cogged the machine and it all fell to shit. Mix that with a super bug that took out all four kids and I am barely alive. So, I am going to continue to write because it soothes my crazies, but maybe, just maybe, I can ease the throttle around here for a hot second.

3 proactive ways to deal with stress.,"Before you read any further, it’s important to recognize that stress is experienced subjectively. What might be a very stressful situation for one person might not bother another person at all. Similarly, everyone has varying degrees of what they consider tolerable stress. For instance someone like Serena Williams, who lives under intense public scrutiny and carries an enormous weight of expectation on her shoulders, can tolerate a higher degree of daily stress than the average person. Stress can also manifest itself in surprising ways. Some people get angry when they’re stressed, others feel sad. Stress can motivate one person to work harder, and scare another person into completely shutting down. What usually happens to you when you get stressed out? To manage your stress, get in the habit of noticing what causes your stress and how you react. And try to be specific. It’s not enough to realize that your job is stressful, for example. Think about what in particular about it weighs on you. Is it pitching to prospects? Meeting tight deadlines? Laying off employees? The closer you can get to the root of your stress, the better equipped you’ll be to handle it. Let’s say laying off or firing employees is what stresses you out the most about your job. You determine that the hardest part is having to break the news to them face-to-face. Instead of waiting for the next ill-fated employee to come into your office, prepare yourself as much as possible in advance. Here’s what you can do, in this or any other situation, to manage your stress: The above are all solid ways of tackling stress, but if you are feeling overwhelmed it might be time to see a professional. There are many local health care experts, such as therapists, counselors, and psychiatrists, who are trained specifically to help you work through your stress. We also offer a professionally-curated online library of mental health resources that cover stress and anxiety in great detail. You can access all of it by signing into your LifeSpeak account. If you don’t have a LifeSpeak account, simply have your HR team reach out to us. Originally published at LifeSpeak.",2017
My Anxiety,"I had a full blown panic attack inside the women’s locker room of the YMCA today. I swam for 30 minutes nothing too hard or that would over extend my abilities. Basically I didn’t push myself at all! But when I sat down in the locker room, my chest contracted, and breathing felt like I was slowly dying. Despite what I knew, I tried to suck in air as fast as I could. My limbs went numb and my vision narrowed and darkened. I couldn’t, no matter how I tried in the moment, calm my racing thoughts or heart. Every time I tried to take a slow breath, it felt as if someone was squeezing my lungs inside my chest. I don’t know how long I sat in the room, cradled in the lap of a stranger, when the ambulance came or how long I sat breathing and trying desperately to make light of my sad situation. But I know now that I want to get out, to lose myself in something, anything else. The world is a terrible place, until recently I was happy living in the illusion of bliss.",2017
For all anxiety sufferers out there I want to give you an advice from experience:,"The ONE SECRET for overcoming your social anxiety and gain confidence in life is to live in the present moment. I know you’ve heard a lot about it, from people around you, to articles and videos on the internet, but maybe you never considered it seriously. It is the only cure. Trust me nothing else will work. STOP POPPING PILLS AND SURFING THE INTERNET TO KNOW ABOUT THEM, throw them away and start a new beginnig today, right now. How to do it? Your 5 senses. Use them. Focus on them. Go with the flow of what is happening around you. Just be the result of this present moment. Don’t get into your mind thinking about what to say or even trying to understand the words you’re hearing. Listen and be a spontaneous reaction to your listening. Talking about confidence, you already are confident but you’re trying too hard and yet failing to find that confidence within you. You always have second thoughts about your words, your actions and your looks maybe. Why? Because you care a lot about the outcome. You care a lot about if you may be hurting someone by the words you’re saying. Or maybe you’re worrying if you look stupid or ugly and if that person notices that. Try to ignore your thoughts just for a sec and instead shift your focus outwards. That is when you unleash your inner powers and feel the natural confidence within you. Forget about the past. Thinking about yesterday kills the peace of today. Make peace with your past. Forgive yourself and anyone who once caused you any pain. Let go of your grudges and fears. It is time to go on. I hope every anxiety sufferrer gets the message and starts from today the journey of a new life, and a new beginning.",2017
How to Deal with The Anxiety of Increasingly Less Time in Your Life,"With my 30th birthday fast approaching (well, approaching as in I just turned 29), it’s hard not to think about time. The time you’ve had, the time you’re having, and the amount of time you have left in the future. And at the tender age of 29, I can only imagine how much one thinks about time when they’re 40, 50, and even sixty. Because I remember when I was 18, and 22, and all the other ages I was before I became “conscious,” which, to me, represents the moment I realized that I wasn’t immortal and that my life-path was up to me and me alone. Success wasn’t guaranteed. I was 25. Every year prior to that paradigm-shifting moment, I lived my life on impulse and emotion. I was unaware of the passage of time in that I didn’t realize how nonrenewable it was. I was going to live forever (obviously), so who cared if I dicked around for a year or five? But then it dawned on my that my time was finite. I didn’t have an infinite amount to spend on the achievement of my goals and finding the life I wanted. One of fulfillment and value. But now, one year away from a new decade, the march of time becomes increasingly apparent. Did I maximize my 20s? Am I moving forward into my 30s in the direction I want? Will I ever do everything I want in life before it’s all over? The answer, of course, is “who knows?” Time stops for no one, and there’s nothing you or I can do about it (yet). So, instead of trying to overcome the never ending anxiety that washes over your body when you think about your own mortality, it’s time to focus on maximizing the time you have. The first step is to understand that your fear and anxiety will never go away. They’ll ebb and flow, but they’ll always be around in one for or another. Call it an evolutionary trait. The desire for personal survival above almost all else. When I first started dealing with the anxiety of a fleeting life, it would keep me up at night and rule my thoughts in the day-to-day. It would literally cause me to be less productive because I’d get caught in a negative thought loop and forget to start the laundry or respond to that email. I couldn’t help it. I’m going to be 30, I’d think, how can I stay in my 20s forever? There’s still so much I want to do! I expected to be a world famous (insert dream of the moment here) by the age of 25 and travel the world as a young prophet. And here I am on the precipice of a new decade and no one’s yet kissed my feet! Well, I soon came to the hard realization that these aspirations of a young twenty-something weren’t going to happen. I had to deal with it. And then it dawned on me that time would never stop. It’s been moving for 14 billion years and should move for another 14 billion, all things equal. Why would it care about my measly 100 years? Humans are amazing in that we can think and wonder and plan and dream. We ponder the infinite wonders of the universe and try to figure out our place within the massive fold. However, our “place” might just be that we’re here, we experience, and then we’re here no more. It’s the never-ending cycle. Which means that we can’t worry about time and the anxiety it causes. It’ll never stop, and we’re hardwired to always want to live, so it’s natural we worry about our nonrenewable resource. It’ll never stop. So learn to live with your emotions. Rather than fighting it, accept it. Remember that “Life isn’t a problem to solve but a reality to experience.” You can’t stop time, but you can try to have the best time possible with the amount you have. Here’s where it get’s tricky. You’ve accepted the fact that time will never stop. You’ve even accepted the fact that it’ll always cause you some level of anxiety and fear. Now’s the time to use your own mortality as a positive constraint. Seek to maximize your daily experiences. However, we humans are caught between the desire to throw caution into the wind and live in the moment, and at the same time, plan for a safe and stable future. We have short-term goals and long-term goals, and often times, one contradicts the other. I want to travel to Australia tomorrow, for example. But if I do, I’d have to quit my job and lose out on financial security and a growing 401(k). And it’s a valid concern. An unstable future can result in regret and a negative life down the line. But, too much focus on the future also leads to regret when you get to the end and you think about all you should’ve done in your youth. But there’s no reason we can’t balance both. In fact, if we want to maximize life, we need both. For me, whenever I feel most “alive,” or when I feel the most fulfilled, it’s when I’m doing fun things in the day-to-day and also working toward a long-term goal. So, in order to maximize the time you have, you need to be present-minded and also long-term focused. You can plan a long weekend getaway backpacking around the U.S. National Parks and still work a job that is fulfilling and saves for your retirement. You can plan to quit your job and travel around Europe and then spend the next 18 months saving money and preparing. If you’re worried about your 401(k), for example, save six month’s of travel expenses over the first year, and then spend the next six months doubling-down on your retirement contribution so that when you quit in July, you’ll already have saved for the year. The point is that you have to live! L-I-V-E live. But, in order to live a fulfilling life, you have to create one that takes advantage of the fleeting moment and also hedges your life bet by preparing for an uncertain future. Don’t forget to say “yes” to that crazy weekend or that impromptu invite to visit a cousin in another state. This is the act of experiencing life. But don’t forget to set and work toward long-term goals, either. This is the act of giving your life purpose. Hell, I don’t know, do you? I’m reminded of Alan Watts. According to him, the point of life is to experience it. Case closed. The Universe, he says, is everything that ever was and everything that ever will be. We’re made up of matter that’s been created, destroyed, and made again, and in both a scientific and mystic sense, he’s right. There will never be anyone ever like you again. The way in which you view the world and the way in which you experience will never happen again. Your perspective is unique, and it’s therefore your duty to perceive as much as you can while you still can. But, of course, you still need those pesky long-term goals. It’s ok to strive for a better life. Just remember to live in the moment as you push toward the future. Which reminds me of one of my favorite quotes. “The only way a tadpole can turn into a frog is to live everyday happy as a tadpole.” Be happy, fellow tadpoles.

Let it all out…,"Just talk- For once I am not going to be the procrastinator I always am. The person that is always thinking, saying, and swearing they will do things, and just never getting round to it. Either finding an excuse like I was too busy, or I couldn’t get in touch with the right people, or I’ll do it later this afternoon…which turns in to I’ll do it tomorrow, which turns in to, I’ll never get it done. 2016 is the year of doing. And I’ve been doing just that. I just do things. Something as simple as booking that psychologists appointment, calling my coach, organising to see a friend I haven’t seen in awhile. All these little things I know will help me in the long run with big things. Like I want to win that spring classic so I am going to do xyz starting now. The first step, the x, is dealing with my own mental health issues. Something that has brought me to my knees on many occasions, and came to a head in December, where I was so lost, and just so very sad. After reading the sad news that bmx legend Dave Mirra took his life, I stopped, I paused and I just sat on my bed and thought long and hard for a second. Hadn’t I just been in a really dark place last night when I was home alone (we’ll get more in to that later), no one around, no one to talk to at that moment. And you find yourself slipping in to these dark thoughts. They just flood your mind, I can’t explain why or how it happens, but it does, and it’s so fucking hard to drag yourself out, particularly when you’re alone. The problem being I feel is we have too much, and we are always wanting more, nothing is ever good enough. Particularly with elite athletes, we only know how to function at the highest level, we base everything we do on performance, we judge ourselves, we compare ourselves, and to be honest, it can become quite exhausting. Now, I’m generalising here, because there are a lot of athletes out there who might read this and not relate in the slightest bit. That is not who I am talking to, however, I’m sure all elite athletes can relate on some level. It comes down to coping mechanisms. For some of us, it doesn’t come as easy, and that’s nothing to be ashamed of. I myself am a very deep thinker, a worrier, for as long as I can remember. I do not have the greatest coping mechanisms. I can recall one particular moment at the 2000 pan pacific games championships at home bush where I made myself so nervous and stressed before the 800m final that I was in tears at the fence trying to hug my dad. Why the tears? I was pretty much guaranteed a medal based on my times, I had beaten most of the girls all year round, I was fit, strong, good to go. So what was the problem? Fear of failure, disappointing my parents, disappointing myself? I don’t know if I ever really stopped and thought “hey if you go out there and run your heart out, give it everything you’ve got and you win, that’s awesome! And if you don’t win, then that’s awesome, because you gave it everything, and that’s all you can do. Some people are just faster on the day”. Sounds like a perfectly logical conversation to have with ones self before a race. But that is just not how my brain would work, I would focus rather on a poor outcome, and the repercussions of it, rather than just focusing on getting the job done. Just run like I did in every training session leading up to this moment. Anyway I digress, I’m giving a small example of how my brain functioned as a kid athlete, and how my anxiety has always been something plaguing me. Going back to me falling in to a dark place just the other night, I can see and relate to these other athletes. I’m no legend like Dave Mirra, or Leisel Jones, but i understand the sadness that sometimes just overwhelms you. Even when to the outside you appear to be one of the happiest people around. It’s usually the ones like me with bucket loads of friends, always on the go, so outgoing which are the most depressed. I believe it’s because I try to distract myself from me. I have never particularly liked myself, I’ve always been my worst critic, we all are, but it’s like I just want more and more from myself, and I just can’t seem to get it. It’s almost this sense of self entitlement. I feel like I need to make a difference in the world, I need to contribute on some higher level, I need to be….special? Being “normal” whatever the hell that word means, terrifies me. Settling down, buying a house, having a car, being in one spot, working some job that ties me down scares the shit out of me. It always has. I’ve always searched to be different, to do things differently. That word, “search”. Searching for something…looking for meaning. Why? why does everything we do have to have some meaning other than just living? I get bogged down on these thoughts because I feel that the life I lead is such a selfish way of life, that I don’t deserve it in a sense. See, there’s that self criticism again. And any good psychologist would now say “but why do you feel you deserve all the wonderful things that happen to you?”. My response usually, I have no idea, that is why I’m talking to you! It’s the way I think, it’s the way I’m wired, I am who I am, but one thing I’ve realised is I can be in control of my thoughts. I can choose to be happy or sad, and I can choose to seek help or not seek help. And I’m getting better at reaching out and seeking the help I need. Back to my story of falling in to a dark place last night. I was slipping, but I realised it, so I contacted my dad, and we talked. It was as simple as that. Someone who I trust dearly, even though we have had our differences, he is one person I know that understands my strange mind. I just wish, I hope that more people would just reach out and get the help they need. I know now it’s not a weakness, but if I just let things slide, and fall down the rabbit hole, that’s weakness. So I figure just talk about it, and maybe if I talk about, other athletes, other people will feel like they can just talk about whats going on in their heads. We are all unique, we all have our flaws, and yes we all have our weaknesses. If you recognise your weaknesses, you can conquer them. We all have an Achilles heel, the difference between you and Achilles is if you recognise your weakness, you can figure out a way to protect yourself from it, and maintain your strength.",2017
Aider son enfant anxieux à s’apaiser,"Il existe plusieurs facteurs qui peuvent engendrer de l’anxiété chez votre enfant : un divorce, des difficultés à l’école, l’arrivée d’un bébé dans la fratrie, la peur de l’échec… Cela peut ainsi créer des troubles du sommeil, un refus d’aller à l’école ou encore des maux de ventre ou des crises d’angoisse chez l’enfant. Comment aider votre loulou à apaiser ses angoisses ? Pistache vous donne toutes ses astuces pour un loulou plus serein au quotidien. Gare à vos propres angoisses Les enfants ressentent tout un tas de choses que les adultes ne perçoivent pas forcément. En effet, un enfant capte les angoisses de ses parents. Si vous avez la phobie des chiens, il y a de grandes chances que votre loulou en ait lui-même peur si vous paniquez chaque fois que vous en croisez un ! Il pourrait, en effet, se dire que si vous en avez peur c’est qu’il doit y avoir une bonne raison. Veillez donc à ne pas transmettre vos propres angoisses et peurs à votre enfant afin de lui permettre de se faire sa propre expérience et de se découvrir par lui même. Prenez ses angoisses au sérieux Lorsque votre enfant a peur, rassurez-le et consolez-le. Ne le forcez pas à communiquer avec vous mais soyez à l’écoute s’il s’ouvre à vous. Il est important que votre kid sache que vous êtes là pour lui et que vous êtes prêt à l’écouter à tout moment. Vous pouvez cependant trouver d’autres moyens pour qu’il puisse évacuer ses angoisses, comme le dessin, par exemple. Si ses angoisses surviennent après un moment difficile (décès, divorce, harcèlement à l’école…), vous devez vous montrez à l’écoute mais surtout soyez ouvert au dialogue. Votre enfant pourra ainsi exprimer toutes ses craintes et vous pourrez également lui apporter quelques éléments de réponse. Aidez-le à chercher des solutions par lui-même Votre loulou doit comprendre qu’il est tout à fait normal d’être angoissé et que cela peut arriver à tout le monde. N’hésitez pas à lui expliquer qu’il est important qu’il en parle et qu’il n’y a aucun mal à ce qu’il se fasse aider pour les surmonter. Vous pouvez également l’aider à trouver des solutions pour palier à ses angoisses, tout en le laissant trouver par ses propres moyens une manière de les résoudre. En le laissant prendre ses propres décisions, votre loulou gagne en autonomie et en confiance en lui. Si votre enfant a du mal à s’endormir parce qu’il est préoccupé par quelque chose, demandez-lui ce qu’il pourrait faire pour mieux dormir. Vous pouvez évidemment le guider et lui apprendre quelques exercices de respirations, par exemple !

I used to think I was psychotic,"I think it was a combination of the lack of sleep, bright monitor screens burning into my eyeballs, and my bleak outlook on life when I thought aloud, “Hey, I think I’m going crazy.” Maybe I stared too long at the screen. I should’ve blinked more. I should’ve never learned how to type without looking down at the keyboard. I shouldn’t have expected to ground myself into a healthier state of mind with these neglected and worn fingertips. I stared at my hands as an exercise to check back into reality. I knew which way the skin folds creased across my knuckles and how the fortune in the left palm foretold longer life and the right promised riches. Just by my will, I curled my fingers tightly into fists then extended outward the pent up energy within them. These two hands stretched before me were mine, but they didn’t feel like mine. They felt foreign. Right now, I’m reading and thinking. Two hours of sleep last night, and two hours today. Maybe that’s why. The liquid crystal display plucks energy out of my eye sockets while they stare at screens all day at work, in the bathroom, and now at home. Maybe. As I’m reading the news of what’s happening to America, I’m contemplating. Because if you were to need them, the only driving directions I can confidently give are to Tacos El Gordo, Korean United Methodist Church of San Diego, Bonita Vista High School, and La Jolla Shores. The only language in which I can confidently express these directions is the one I’m typing out these thoughts. I can describe to you the first time my father took us across the Coronado bridge, and recount tales of my tenure at Clear View Elementary School with some of my best friends. But tonight, I scroll down and swipe through countless feeds of a country ripped in half. I am fearful of the overzealous indignation and the insufferable silence. We have self-righteous warriors wishing each other dead, and the majority consuming a chicken taco but with the chicken on the outside of the taco. I am a citizen of this social media-war torn country, but it doesn’t feel like mine. I feel foreign.",2017
Living With Mental Health Issues Changes All The Time,"I could get through the one story, but for her that’s the one that made it hard to breathe. The mention of hospital equipment or a basketball game helped to pile on more bricks to the ones I’d been practicing inhaling and exhaling with for three years. Given the current political climate, the notion of places without escape routes does it for me too. The new facet to Anxiety is proof that it morphs and never manages to completely break up with you, or you with it. Three years ago my Everest was time. I came into an abundance of it, that was laced with a newly found freedom, a combination of which managed to overwhelm me. I was one person, with too much air in my lungs to evenly breathe. And so I didn’t. For a long time, I choked. I had episodes of complete follow through, where time and breath and the present all aligned and allowed me to live. Then there were moments when one would be at a surplus and I would be left walking a New York I knew but couldn’t be a part of. Time is now something I’ve learned to be selfish with. Years of therapy and of coming up against the same wall of people who felt a right to time that was only mine, it helped me take ownership and responsibility. I found ways to cope — befriending my breathing, music, writing — through the more heart-stopping moments of managing my own time. I learned to love the freedom and flexibility that being self-employed gifted me. So lacking its current motivation, the Everest morphed. It became less about time and more about home. Where is it? How do you find it? Is it okay if it’s different from what you always thought it should be? I started choosing a family that I called home. They knew me in ways that I’d never been known and they loved me for the person I was and not for the role I could play in their lives. With them, I climbed the top of the mountain, redefined the notion of home and found roots in a relationship that I never expected myself to be in. Anxiety tells you stories anchored in your inadequacy and fear. It makes it hard to breathe through good moments, therefore making it hard to see the good at all. It takes bad moments and brings them to life as entire oceans ready to drown you. These are the moments, the times when your entire body is drowned under water, that you need to remind yourself that even if you can’t swim, you can float…as long as you learn to relax your muscles just long enough. Unfold the fist you’ve made of your hand, take deep breaths instead of shallow, uneven ones. Make peace that the waves crashing will be your reality…for a little bit. At breakfast, after taking a minute from picking at her avocado and calling the anxiety by its name, my friend started shifting back to normal breaths and conversation. I’m not sure she noticed that the shift happened, or that she’d helped it happen, but she did. When you let moments be what they need to be you stop feeling exhausted at the end of each wave. Having patience with yourself and with your Anxiety, is not the only way to learn to manage the drowning moments, but it’s a place to start. ********* I’m the founder of toodamnyoung.com.

Feeling Fine? Let’s Break The Habit.,"Written in timeliness with Time To Change’s #timetotalk awareness day (Thursday 02 February 2017), I’d like to challenge anybody reading this blog to think about their day to day verbal interactions with people, or even go as far to pick up non-verbal cues that may suggest that everything is not ‘fine’. This post has a slightly British lean to it, but we have become a nation of ‘How are you’s?’ and ‘I’m fine’s’. At first dissection, you would think that a ‘How are you?’ was an altruistic act showing genuine care for the wellbeing of another, and for many it is, don’t get me wrong. But when did the ‘How are you’s?’ become so customary? It’s almost like it’s the new way to pass somebody in the work corridor and acknowledge them politely, without any thought to how they actually might be doing. And let’s face it, exchanges are over in no time at all, giving no time to truthfully answer. In most cases when I ask how somebody is, it is because I want to know. Or I might re-phrase it and say something like ‘so what have you been up to?’, giving less room for a ‘meh’ fine answer. And sometimes….people do not want to talk. That’s fine. See I couldn’t help myself!! In among all my waffle, consider this…Let’s be more mindful of our ‘How are you’s?’. Let’s load them with intent. Let’s pick up on those non-verbal cues where someone may struggle to discuss what’s on their mind, but might be hoping for a ‘How are you?’ from the right person, to open up. If someone is willing to lend their ear, let them. Don’t say I’m fine, say ‘well actually I’m feeling a bit crappy’. And if you don’t get an ‘I’m fine’, be open to listening. Sometimes that’s all it takes to make somebody feel heard, understood or even start the ball rolling to be fine, the next time they are asked. Not feeling fine and don’t feel up to talking? How about writing it down?",2017
How to Heal Emotional Pain Without Visiting a Therapist,"Emotional pain can arise from past relationships, losing a loved one, being confused with our sexuality, traumatic experiences, and other reasons. Dealing with this pain is typically unpleasant, thus we resort to avoiding it. I recently had the privilege of interviewing Kelsey Grant, a self-love expert, for my podcast. One of the most powerful ideas that came out of our conversations is that our pain is valuable. It can teach us but we’re normally unwilling to listen. Kelsey is a big believer that we can use our pain to support us in moving forward. Below is the framework she uses with her clients and herself to allow pain to be our teacher. If we resist our pain we are unable to learn from it. Allowing pain to be our teacher begins by granting ourselves permission to feel the pain. Often when we feel emotional pain, we choose to escape it and numb it. Numbing will only prevent us from learning. Kelsey’s process begins by allowing pain to flow through our body and embracing it. Anytime we are sick we begin to start taking care of the body by hydrating, providing it with nutrients and resting it. The same is for pain. If we’re sensing a difficult emotion or something has happened to trigger our emotions it’s necessary to start taking care of our body. Whether that be green smoothies or eating well, Kelsey starts nourishing her body to provide an environment for the pain to operate. Typically when we feel pain, our natural reaction is shut down and resist it. Kelsey does the opposite, she engages it. She starts this process with some form of physical activity, like biking, to start activating the pain. Our pain is typically wrapped up in negative mental stories, the goal is not to sit with it but to burn through the energy. Cultivating an environment for our pain to move outward begins the cycle of accessing and processing it. This step is like a mantra. Kelsey begins this part of the process by saying to herself “I choose to see this differently.” Often our pain has a similar face and it’s challenging for us to see any good in it. It’s our responsibility to sit with it and see the lesson that it’s seeking to teach us. It’s like embracing a mindset saying “I deserve better. I’m willing for this pain to show something that has been hidden from my consciousness.” I’m a firm believer that our emotions act like a lighthouse guiding us to shore. And if we’re hurting and suffering that there is something we need to reflect on. The last and final step is asking, “what is something I could dedicate myself to something bigger than the pain I’m feeling?” Everyone feels pain. We all understand it even when we think our pain is unique or different. The key becomes, what can you focus on to move through your pain? A purpose statement to give your pain deeper meaning. Can we use this pain to motivate us for a run? Can we use this pain to create a piece of art? Can we use this pain to create a better relationship with your father, mother, sister, brother? For Kelsey, it was making a decision to support 500,000 people to love themselves better. Every day she woke up and dedicated herself to that ideal — if I was that person who was going to lead 500,000, who do I need to become? What do I need to face today? From this Kelsey’s belief was born — “the degree which I can support people, is the degree which I’m intimate with my own shit.” When we allow our pain to serve a higher purpose it’s no longer a limiting story, rather it becomes a path to guide us. It is through this process that we can allow pain to become our messenger and a teacher to us all. If you wish to listen to the full interview with Kelsey on how to heal emotional pain, you can listen to it here. Here to support you on your journey, Filip",2017
Anxiety’s Kryptonite,"Just Breathe! If someone would have told me that I’d be teaching my clients about the importance of paced breathing, I would have said they were nuts. As a student, I would have rolled my eyes and said that this kind of intervention was useless. BOY WAS I WRONG! Proper breathing technique is an extremely important addition to any treatment plan, especially when treating anxiety. Let me explain why and hopefully I’ll convince you to the degree that I was convinced that breathing is an indispensable tool in increasing general well-being. Part of our nervous system controls automatic behavior and another part controls voluntary behavior. Within our automatic system (properly called the autonomic nervous system), we have two subsystems we need to understand in this context. The sympathetic nervous system is the very popularized “fight or flight” system. When an emergency occurs, this system will cause us to fight or flee. The parasympathetic nervous system (also part of the autonomic nervous system) on the other hand, allows us to calm down after an emergency occurs and the threat is gone. An individual with anxiety problems has a very active sympathetic nervous system. Usually, anxiety is our friend, in that the symptoms will cause us to survive in an emergency or in a life-or-death scenario. However, individuals with anxiety trouble have an active sympathetic system, not because they are in an emergency, but because they are creating fictitious life-or-death scenarios with their fearful thoughts. As a result of these fearful thoughts, the sympathetic nervous system is triggered and symptoms of anxiety like, trembling, rapid heartbeat, and shortness of breath, ensue. Given these facts, it’s not difficult to deduce what is needed. As therapists, we need to help our clients gain more access to the parasympathetic system, to lower the frequent us of the sympathetic system. It is no secret on how we might do this: PACED BREATHING WILL TRIGGER THE USE OF THE PARASYMPATHETIC SYSTEM. When you breathe in a relaxed manner, anxiety actually cannot exist. It’s physiologically impossible to trigger the parasympathetic system yet remain anxious. I use this knowledge to light a fire of motivation among my clients and to convince them that breathing will legitimately help reduce their anxiety. Now, commonly, my clients say that breathing helps temporarily but once paced breathing stops, their anxiety returns. OF COURSE IT DOES! When you train for a marathon or a piano recital, how often must you train? You cannot simply go to the gym once and expect to excel during the marathon. That same logic applies here. You must begin to train your parasympathetic system to be more present and accessible. You need to practice paced breathing 8–12 times per day for a few months in order to see any results. Just like everything else, reducing your anxiety will not happen overnight but it will happen once you gain control of your body once and for all. Of course, modifying your breathing is not the be-all-end-all of anxiety treatment. Emotions also need to be expressed and thoughts need to be restructured. However, modifying your breathing is the first pivotal step to obtaining real change. I urge you to acknowledge the importance of paced breathing in reducing your anxiety and increasing your general well-being! via: http://sassypsychologist.com",2017
Action As Antidote To Political Anxiety,"The spring semester has started today and it is no exaggeration to say that I’ve not gone into any previous semester–over a period extending to the fifteen years I’ve spent here at Brooklyn College–feeling quite as unsettled as I do today. Perhaps it was the third cup of coffee, perhaps it was just the stage-fright that is my usual companion to semester kick-offs. Or perhaps it was just dread. We live in interesting times, and one of the tolls these times exact is a psychological one. This morning, I met one of my students in my office to go over his plans for an independent study in the philosophy of science this semester. I assigned readings, talked about possible writing assignments, and made some preliminary remarks about how I hoped our fortnightly discussions would go. Our conversation proceeded smoothly in general, but there were a couple of rough spots: first, my student greeted me by asking how I had been, and I found myself unable to answer for a few seconds, and then, when my student told me how he had spending time at JFK providing translation services for the ACLU lawyers helping resolve the fiasco created by Donald Trump’s anti-refugee executive order, I was rendered speechless again. My student is Egyptian-American; born to, and raised in, America by Egyptian parents . He is one of the brightest and most sincere students I have ever had the pleasure of interacting with here at Brooklyn College. He is hard-working, erudite, passionate, committed to being a good student and a good human being. I am proud of him, and happy to be somehow involved in his education. I am, therefore, protective of him too; I am concerned for his safety and well-being these days. This fear is not a particularly well-formed one, and so it amounts to a species of disabling anxiety. (His country of origin is not one of the blacklisted countries of the executive order, but I was still alarmed to hear his American citizen parents were planning on traveling to Egypt this summer.) I suspect that what underwrites that my emotional responses to my student’s presence is a deeper worry about my family and friends; there is no doubt that the world today is a more dangerous place than it was on January 19th or November 8th: bigotry and racism have acquired executive power, and it is being exercised vigorously, even if incoherently; political chaos is almost upon us; and much worse apparently awaits. The only antidote to this quasi-cosmic funk is that old elixir: action. This administration needs toppling and many points of pressure exist in order to do so: pressure on elected representatives to block cabinet nominations for now, and later, against legislative atrocities; financial support to those–like the ACLU and SPLC–fighting legal battles; vigorous public protest, civil disobedience, and direct action, including but not limited to, general strikes. (Perhaps hacktivists will step up and make it harder for the technical infrastructure required to implement Trump and Bannon‘s regime to actually function; on this point, more anon.) Thus far, I’ve written and donated and made a few phone calls; much more needs to be done; therapeutic relief awaits.

3 WAYS TO TAME THE MONKEY MIND,"Do you ever find yourself jumpy, anxious, and overwhelmed with a million thoughts racing through your head? Is the feeling so overpowering that you become paralyzed and unable to take action? The origins of the monkey mind date back to the Buddha. The expression is used to describe the inability to quiet our mind when there are many thoughts, ideas, and worries swirling around in our head. Our tendency to multi-task and our addiction to technology exacerbates the problem. Some symptoms of the monkey mind include inability to sleep, exhaustion (maybe due to lack of sleep), memory issues, and inability to focus. Now that we’ve identified the problem and the symptoms, what can be done? By practicing these strategies on a daily basis, you can quiet the monkey mind: Taking a few minutes each day to sit quietly or follow a guided meditation helps to quiet the mind. When meditating (at least as I will describe it. I am not an expert and recognize there are many methods of meditating), you breathe in and out through your nose. The idea is to inhale deeply and exhale slowly, focusing only on your breath. This is where you might say, “But, Sharon, there are a million thoughts flying through my head.” Exactly…that’s the monkey mind! If you have tried meditating before and thought you were not doing it correctly because your mind wandered, give it another chance. Your mind is expected to wander and it in no way is an indication that you are doing it wrong. Let the thoughts drift to the side, with no judgment, and bring yourself back to focusing on your breath. As you do this repeatedly, you strengthen your ability to focus. Imagine how this can help you throughout the day when you are trying to concentrate and other thoughts fly into your head. If you have trouble meditating on your own, try a guided meditation. I started using Insight Timer last year and love it! Do you ever find that when you are in a meeting or waiting in line at the supermarket your mind starts wandering to (and stressing over) what you have to do later that day? We have all been there. You have so much to do before leaving the office…when will this meeting end?! E-mails, phone calls, quarterly reporting…why is that vice president still talking?? Or, perhaps you are still stewing because the barista in Starbucks got your coffee order wrong this morning. Seriously?! You go to the same Starbucks every day…how hard is it to get a Grande Skinny Decaf Latte with half a Splenda right? Either way, you are contaminating the time you are in. Your participation in the meeting is marginalized because you are not focused on the content when you are busy worrying about other things. The monkey mind has taken over again! Wherever you are, be totally present and try to only focus on what is being discussed. This conscious state of being is mindfulness. According to research, repeated thoughts create neural pathways. The more you identify positive things in your life, the deeper and more pronounced those pathways become. Consider keeping a gratitude journal. I started one last summer and have already seen a change in my overall outlook on life. At the end of each day, I write three things for which I am grateful. Over time, this daily practice trains your brain to look for the positive in things…it becomes a reflex. So, even if you feel like you were born or raised a pessimist, you can start to see your cup as being half full and even overflowing. The combined daily practice of meditation, mindfulness, and gratitude brings a sense of peace and order, keeping the monkey mind at bay. The more you practice, the greater your ability to focus and react calmly in stressful situations.",2017
"Anxiety Disorders And Depression Treatment Market To Represent USD 18.3 Billion Opportunity Globally by 2025: Grand View Research, Inc.","The global anxiety disorders and depression treatment market is expected to reach a value of USD 18.3 billion by 2025. The rising incidence of depression worldwide is anticipated to drive the market growth in the coming years. Increasing adoption of devices and psychotherapies has resulted in the declining demand for antidepressants in the recent years. The rising geriatric population prone to depression and surging prevalence of anxiety disorders, including phobias and generalized anxiety disorder, are further contributing toward the growing demand for antidepressants to treat mental illnesses over the forecast period. Moreover, the introduction of technologically advanced therapies, such as medical implants used for brain stimulation and virtual reality exposure therapies using smartphone-based applications, furnish patients with innovative treatment alternatives.

I’m Keeping My Eyes On Jesus,"Wonderful things have been happening in my life. I am finally pursuing the things that bring me joy. The thing though is that I am terrified! It has always felt safer to remain stagnant and small. Being small quiets the anxiety and trepidation, but it does not calm the desires of my heart to add so much more to this world. Fear has been a longtime companion of mine, not a friend certainly. Fear is a bully that robs you of the gifts and talents that the Lord has bestowed upon you! Every time I have looked fear in the face and done it anyway I have felt complete joy in the aftermath. Last night I started to feel fearful and anxious. Instead of chasing the fear I sat quietly with my eyes closed and let Jesus to speak into my heart. He did not disappoint. He never does. I saw a vision of myself standing in the center of a huge log that bridged a wide roaring river. I am fearful of extreme heights, so the panic I felt standing on a slippery log with the noise of the raging river came swift and became all consuming. The river was a long ways down and dotted with giant boulders and jagged rocks if I fell I would be killed instantly. I was trapped by my fear. I could not close my eyes for fear of falling. I could not take a single step, I was frozen. And then He came. Jesus came to me. He came right up to me there on that log where I was completely absorbed in my fear and he whispered ever so softly… “Keep your eyes on me, don’t look down. I will not let you fall.” No, my fear did not magically disappear, but it lessened with every single beat of my heart. He walked effortlessly backwards across the log as I kept my eyes on His. I was no longer concentrating on my fear. My entire focus was on Him and His love for me. Did I make it to the other side of the river? No, I haven’t yet, but I know that if I keep my eyes on Jesus eventually I will.",2017
Knocked off the Square,"I got knocked off my square somewhere between last week and the very beginning of this week. I have a very bad habit of letting people and just the “little things” throw me completely off after I’ve made a decision and sworn to stick with it. I’m trying desperately hard to work on that piece of me, but because of my anxiety, I can’t seem to find that inner confidence and hold onto it. In fact, the only thing that I seem to really be able to hold onto is bad “ju-ju” (is that how you spell it?). Towards the end of the year, I got accepted for this teaching gig — something I worked many, many years for — and I was super excited, that is, until I found out my training is going to be for 5 weeks in another state. Mind you, I can come home during the weekends because it’s only about a two-hour drive from the training site to my place. But I do have three little children at home (my oldest will be joining the Army soon and my nine-year-old can stay with his father during that time, no problem). I felt very frustrated by this, but when I presented my dilemma to my coworkers, everyone was in agreement: I had at least five months to figure out what the hell I was gonna do with the kids so that I could complete my training. And I felt better about it because I really want to teach, and my future employer (hopefully) has been very supportive of us applicants along the whole journey. And for a couple of weeks, I grew excited about my opportunity to do something better for my life and for my family…and I made myself believe that God had gotten me this far — so He will definitely see to it that things work out so that I can go out of state and complete my training. But you know what? One day, I spoke to someone about my plans, and just like that, after our conversation, I was back to feeling crummy and frustrated and defeated — all because this one person told me that I was basically crazy for accepting the job offer, knowing I would have to go out of state and leave my kids behind for a little. When I had gotten accepted for this job, I had immediately ended my job search (which I had been on for almost two years). Again, I believed that God had gotten me this far not to leave me stranded when summer training starts. He had given me a babysitter, given me the money to buy a nice interview outfit, made sure I arrived to my interview site on time, and had gotten me the job. My father had even given me the money to take the big Praxis exam so that I could get ready to get my teacher’s license. But with just one 20-minute conversation, I suddenly put all plans aside and decided that teaching was not my fate after all, simply because of a little technicality with finding the necessary help with my kids while I am away, trying to make a better life for us all. And it’s funny, because all of the people I have around me to help — they don’t want to help. They just want to tell me that I can’t do it, instead of just offering to be there for me for just five little weeks. So I ended up getting back on the job search, even though I had promised myself that I wouldn’t do that. Even though I had promised myself that I would start making decisions and sticking with them, despite what everyone else has to say. I mean, I’m an adult for God’s sake! A very capable adult who has struggled through shit that most people cannot even dream of. And yet, here I am — off my square once again, because of one naysayer. I’m that far gone and that low on confidence that at 36, I let one person shake me and compel me to question who I am and what the hell I’m doing with myself. And this is why I say that I hold onto too much bad “ju-ju” (or however you spell it). I hold onto the anxiety, the fear, the confusion, the “wishy-washiness,” and the faith in what other people have to say — other people who don’t help me with any aspect of my life…except for pulling me down further into my darkness. I just want to escape the negativity, give all of my naysayers a big fuck you! and retreat into my own little corner until I can find my own peace.",2017
When I am Anxious.,"When I am anxious,It is like my brain is stuck in glue.An ooy gooey mess of black tar, And can see it.If I look in the mirror I can see it pouring out of every orifice in my head. When I am Anxious,It is like I lost all control of my tongue,It sits in my mouth like a fat useless piece of meat.Try to speak and it gets in the way, Shoving into every word, And not letting anything out. When I am anxious, I shouldn’t even try to speak. My vocal cords close up so tight that it is sometimes hard to breath. Cutting off my air supply, I lose my voice completely. When I am Anxious, I am trapped inside my own head.Unable to use my body,I am left to watch helplessly as my hands miss the wrong cues and my legs feel like rubber.I am scared. When I am Anxious,All I want to do is yell and scream and make it stop,But it doesn’t ever go away.It is like the tide of the Ocean. Always there,Stuck in the background,Sometimes ebbing, sometimes flowing, And I have to learn to control it.I have to learn to keep farther and farther away from the shore.",2017
How to Love Yourself When You’re Depressed,"Note: These are tips that have helped me personally. They may not apply to you, but I’m putting them out there in case they help. God bless. ❤ You’ve probably heard that exercise is good for your mental health, and it is. But on the days when exercise is simply not an option, try just sitting outside for 15–30 minutes. Being outside can be calming, and sunshine (even through clouds) is good for your mood. Even if you’re just surfing the internet on your phone, it’s still better for you than if you were inside. 2. Cuddle with a stuffed animal There is some research that suggests cuddling stuffed animals can help calm feelings of anxiety and depression. People struggling with PTSD also use stuffed animals for comfort. So if you have a stuffed animal that you love, enjoy cuddling it guilt-free. It really is good for you. 3. Play with a dog or cat If you have a dog or cat, this should be easy for you. If not, you can either ask a friend who has pets if you can visit them and their pets, or consider volunteering at a local rescue center. Many rescue dogs need to be walked regularly, so volunteers are probably more than welcome. 4. Draw/Doodle/Color Coloring books have been shown to relieve stress. I’ve discovered that coloring during social occasions can relieve my anxiety and help me spend more time with people than I could handle otherwise. Another thing: for years, when I felt really stressed or anxious, I was tempted to cut. I found out if I doodled on my arm (the place I wanted to cut), it helped me in that moment. I would draw a balloon, a heart, a word like “hope” or “live,” or even a prayer like “hold me now.” Something about the physical pressure of doodling with a pen on my skin, as well as the choice to create something (even a doodle) rather than destroy, helped calm me. Which leads me to another suggestion… 5. Seek Non-Harmful Physical Sensations The roughness of a tree’s bark. The way water rolls over your fingers. The wind in your hair. Walking barefoot in the grass. Finding physical sensations, especially in nature, helps you reconnect to the outside world. Sometimes our minds and emotions can be so consuming, it’s hard to connect to the reality outside us. Touching something natural has always helped me remember that there is more to life than my emotions, and that there is still beauty in the world. Choosing a physical experience also seems to lessen the desire for self-harming physical experiences.",2017
Five Ways to Find the Perfect Psychotherapist,"A psychotherapist is a licensed therapist that helps individuals improve their thought processes, relationships and social skills while also overcoming negative behaviors. There are many different types of psychotherapists and they carry a diverse range of education, licenses and expertise. A few of the most common types of psychotherapists are psychiatrists (MD), psychologists, licensed marriage and family therapists (LMFT), licensed professional counselor (LPC), licensed clinical social worker (LCSW) and a licensed psychological associate (LPA). The ideal psychotherapist for you or a loved one will depend largely on which psychiatric disorders you’re experiencing. If you’re experiencing multiple disorders or a co-occurring disorder like a drug or alcohol addiction, you may be best suited enrolling at a dual diagnosis treatment center rather than receiving individual therapy. Depression and anxiety are by far the most common mental disorders in the United States. Unfortunately, many individuals do not seek treatment for these conditions and just chalk them up as “part of life”. A combination of talk therapy with a psychotherapist as well as medication management will be able to help someone live a happier and better functioning life with these conditions. A few of the psychotherapies that you may inquire about with your therapist are cognitive behavioral therapy, dialectical behavior therapy, EMDR therapy or cognitive remediation. The overall goal of these therapies is to help you think more positively, become more mindful and better regulate your emotions. Ask your insurance provider for a referral. Insurance providers work with healthcare treatment providers daily. In order for a psychotherapist to have a working relationship with an insurance provider they must be reputable, experienced, licensed and accredited. Conduct an internet search. The internet will be your best friend because you’ll be to read reviews for psychotherapists and other mental health treatment professionals in your area. Psychology Today is by far the best source for mental health treatment professionals on the internet. On the main page, simply type in your zip code and you’ll see listings for local psychotherapists. A good majority of treatment professionals in your area will have a profile page on Psychology Today. Other resourceful websites for people seeking mental health treatment services include Health Grades, Therapist Ratingz and All Things Treatment. Ask for a referral from a professional you already know in another industry. Your primary physician, attorney or even dentist will have a certain level of familiarity with psychotherapists in the area because they frequently make referrals between each other. Unethical or questionable psychotherapists wouldn’t have the reputation to get quality referrals from other professional so you can typically trust the opinions of other professionals you frequently deal with. Ask friends and family members who they recommend. Most of the time, you will be able to trust the opinions of friends and family members; there is a level of familiarity with friends and family that no one else can match. Plus, friends and family members should be the first to know about whatever mental illness you fear you may be suffering from. Whether or not you share your issues is completely up to your discretion. There isn’t a family out there that hasn’t been touched by mental illness in some shape or form so some relatives will have familiarity with psychotherapists in your area. Common mental disorders like depression and anxiety can lead to other disorders if not addressed soon enough. You deserve a happy and healthy life. Don’t waste another day and seek out a psychotherapist immediately if your quality of life is diminishing.",2017
Happy Foods :),"I tried to keep the list to foods that are easy to find and enjoy. :) With moderation, chocolate can make you happier. Chocolate (especially dark chocolate) has serotonin in it, a neurotransmitter that promotes positive emotions. Spinach is rich in B vitamins, which promote good moods, health in general, and energy. Romaine lettuce also has high amounts of a vitamin B called folate. Eggs have tryptophan, an amino acid necessary for producing serotonin. Berries (including blueberries, strawberries, raspberries, and blackberries) are all rich in vitamin C, which boosts the immune system and helps the body deal with stress. Like berries, oranges are packed with vitamin C. They’re also easy to carry around in a purse or backpack for a quick snack. Chamomile tea calms nerves and helps promote sleep. If you don’t like tea, try taking chamomile supplements pills instead. Yogurt is full of healthy probiotics that are good for your gut. Since most serotonin is made in the gut, keeping your gut healthy means your body can produce serotonin better. Greek yogurt is especially full of probiotics. (If Greek yogurt is too thick for your taste, mixing in some milk works really well.) Honey is good for your immune system and can be used as a natural sweetener. Try using honey instead of processed sugars when possible, since processed sugars hurt your gut and cause sugar crashes that lower your mood. Lemon is rich in vitamin C and is a natural way to get energized. Having a glass of water with a teaspoon of lemon daily is recommended as a way to stay healthy and gain energy.

Are Horror Movies Good For Your Brain?,"Lately the news has been overwhelming. I struggle with an anxiety disorder, and have been looking for ways to tear myself away from the political turmoil occurring online and in the real world. My usual coping mechanisms haven’t been working, so I’ve tried to mix things up in an attempt to find my new normal. I’ve liked horror movies and scary stories from a very young age. But why do people enjoy scaring themselves? Recently, I realized that watching unrealistic horror scenarios made me feel better about my own life. Many movies and books are so outlandish that I didn’t worry about any of the terrible things happening in the stories. I knew I was safe from ghosts and monsters. It was easier to watch two hours of poorly developed characters making their way through a haunted mansion than it was to watch two hours of coverage of a mass shooting. Scientists have studied how scary movies help a growingly anxious society cope with their lives. Dr. Mathias Clasen from Aarhus University in Denmark said in an interview with Broadly that “[e]xposure to horror films can be gratifying when the negative emotions caused by the film are manageable. Moreover, there’s psychological distance when we watch a horror film. We know it’s not real — or at least, some parts of our brain know it isn’t real. Other parts — ancient structures located in the limbic system — respond as though it were real.” This theory was proven back in 1974 at the University of Wisconsin. There had been a recent murder on the campus, and researchers wanted to see if students would avoid seeing a scary movie after a real traumatizing event. The researchers looked at the attendance numbers for one theater showing a Disney movie and one showing a horror film. Attendance for the dramatic movie stayed about the same after the murder. On the other hand, attendance went up significantly for the horror film. Students weren’t avoiding gore. They were actively seeking out thrills in a movie where even if there wasn’t a happy ending, there was closure. CNN also published an article on the benefits of horror. They interviewed Margee Kerr, a sociologist, about the brain’s response to fictional horror. Dr. Clasen was right when he observed that our brains respond to scary fictional situations as though they were real. According to Kerr, certain parts of the brain believe the threat is real and release adrenaline. We also get a dose of dopamine. The two chemicals together can give you a kind of natural high that you also get from being in love. When reality begins to become too frightening, it may be time to lose yourself in a good horror flick. It can provide a welcome reprieve from the real life terror we see in our political landscape.",2017
In Praise of Chronic Pain: A Stoic Meditation,"When I first read Epictetus’ quote above, I knew I had to revive this stoic exercise for myself. Just 5 years ago I’d been at the point of suicide. And both stoicism and suicide taught me the same lesson: gratitude is the art of living. The last time I thought of suicide was on November 6th, 2011. It was our 3rd anniversary together with my girlfriend Haley and we celebrated with a dinner at Morton’s Steak House. I didn’t want to think of suicide, but I just couldn’t help myself. The excruciating pain in my neck, shoulders and jaw muscles wouldn’t let me think of anything else. It dominated the past three and a half years and it only seemed to be getting worse. If you looked at the Facebook photo from that night, you’d see Haley sitting in a chair with a huge smile on her face and I’m standing behind her, my hands on her shoulders with a faint, weak smile trying desperately to hide the torrential feelings of misery overwhelming me inside. Despite that, we still got the obligatory Facebook likes, comments and congrats from friends and family. What if I have to live like this for the rest of my life? Will I have to suffer every day, ever hour, every minute, every second for the next 40 years?? What if it continues to get worse and I become bedridden? How will I earn a living? How will I make any girl happy? Will I become dependent on Haley or my family? I’d rather die than having to face a lifetime of endless and maddening chronic pain every moment. To wake up to another day of this kind of intense, relentless pain was terrifying to think about. It was becoming downright debilitating and with it, came a shameful new view of myself. If that’s all I had to look forward to, then joy for me was an impossibility. For the past four years, all previous attempts to improve my condition had failed, and with it, the last of my remaining hope. My future was bleak. So there was Haley, smiling as she always does, radiating joy like the angel she is and proud to be by my side for three years — and completely oblivious to the fact that at that very moment, I was quietly yet soberly considering ending it all. With several undergrad degrees, she wasn’t slow or insensitive. I just refused to be honest with her or myself about the reality — and that reality was knocking louder and louder. Of course, I loved her and happy to be with her, but how much longer could I keep this going? She was the one bright spot in my life, but if it meant a lifetime of physical pain with no relief in sight, then even love wasn’t enough. That’s what the photo from 2011 represented to me — the opposite of everything I was before then. I grew up with Tony Robbins, Napoleon Hill, Steven Covey, Dale Carnegie and other similar authors as a teenager. I used to walk into random offices and restaurants as a college student in New York and convinced them to sign profit-sharing contracts with me. I also ran several businesses by the time I was 29. I was fearless. I believed in the magic of thinking big and the power of positive thinking. I was that confident, outgoing, successful entrepreneur you read about in magazines… but suddenly, all that was in a past life. Now, against my own will, I began to think seriously about how to end it. At first, I tried really hard not to… but after a short time — no matter how hard I tried — all my thoughts turned to black. When I saw myself in that photo the next day, the stark contrast of it all — the unbearable inauthenticity of the moment — just killed me. It broke my heart. It was the day I finally died inside. ***** What brought me to this point? I’m still not sure, but near as I can figure it started in 2007 when I was working a stressful full-time job as a mortgage broker (yes, THAT 2007), and while managing an already matured real estate business and a start-up. You could say it was like juggling 2–3 full-time jobs. That’s when the pain in my left jaw started and began to get worse as the years dragged on. And after almost four years of this, I wasn’t being very effective in any business venture. When the brain is overwhelmed with stress, it activates the amygdala and sends the mind and body into fight or flight mode. For survival reasons, our brain has evolved to overwhelmingly respond to pain — real or imagined — versus pleasure. If it senses pain or danger intensely enough and for long enough periods, the brain can get stuck in this stress mode — like a light switch that’s stuck in the “on” position. Dealing with chronic physical pain is like performing a high-wire act. Your muscles are wound tight and so is your mind…it requires all of your focus and concentration to stay calm and balanced and if you slip slightly left or the right, you fall…but there’s no safety net. And in this case, falling means a cycle of severe pain and a long recovery period that can last days. So to say chronic pain often brings anxiety is to put it mildly. Try watching TV while walking on a tightrope, or try socializing with friends while performing this balancing act, or working on your computer or enjoying a Mendelssohn ballet. It’s near impossible to focus on anything else at times and it’s exhausting. Even when you get better at it, the tension of the rope changes day by day, sometimes moment to moment and you’ll fall off no matter how hard you try. But try you must. And even though the fear of falling fades a little — just like the fear of falling — it’s an instinctual reaction. Chronic pain sends danger signals to your brain and you can learn to dampen the signal but the physical pain is still there, constant and very real. Chronic pain sends danger signals to your brain and you can learn to dampen the signal but the physical pain is still there, constant and very real. After that night in 2011, a part of me died, but another part of me woke the hell up. It was the will to live. A deep, primal anger that I’d found myself in such a stupid, terrible situation that could end my life. If I somehow got myself into this I thought, then I can dig my dumb ass out… it was the belief that deep down, I was still better than this. Thus began my journey to recovery. So I put everything else in my life on hold and single-mindedly focused on getting better. I told myself to just give it one more day. And then the next day, I told myself to give it one year and see what happens. Surely if I put my everything into getting better for the next 12 months, I’ll gain some improvement right? I resolved to be more honest with myself and Haley about my struggle. That’s when I researched more seriously and within a couple weeks, found what I thought was a real diagnosis. That my pain was really TMJ pain. Soon after that, a dentist confirmed it. I also suspected I had Generalized Anxiety Disorder. And wouldn’t you know it — I found a psychologist to confirm that diagnosis too! Since then, I’ve been diagnosed with Temporomandibular Joint Disorder (TMJD), Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD) and, I strongly suspect, Cervical Dystonia (although I can’t confirm this diagnosis due to insurance reasons). TMJ symptoms are often overlapping Cervical Dystonia symptoms that bring tight, painful muscles in the jaw, neck, shoulders and back. And they both bring about a fair amount of anxiety, social anxiety, and mental stress. But after several doctors and tests, I stopped looking for another diagnosis and focused only on what I could control physically and mentally. On the physical side, this lead me to a physiatrist that used dry needle trigger point therapy, where he used a syringe to repeatedly stab trigger muscles into submission. I thanked him and paid him hundreds of dollars each time. The interesting thing was, as I finally experienced some physical relief, lots of my severe GAD symptoms and social anxiety began to clear up along with it! On the mental side, I took a Mindfulness Based Stress Reduction Training (MBSR) course. I learned that focusing on the breath to clear the mind also brings with it a certain freedom and control over negative, ruminating thoughts… and learning to clear some of that inner dialogue brought about some mental relaxation…. and experiencing mental relaxation brought with it some physical relaxation. So I continued my mental training with Cognitive Behavioral Therapy and found it was inspired and based on Stoic Philosophy, which I studied in earnest. Over the next two years, I continued my recovery with a lot of body work and learned the Alexander Technique as well as Feldenkrais. Doing this helped me train my body to release muscular tension and I became aware of my bad habits. Awareness of my body grew to a deeper level than I ever thought possible and I’ve distilled these lessons to a 20-minute body and mind meditation ritual that I perform every morning, twice a day. Sometimes it’s like a miracle I pull off, reconditioning and reorienting my muscles in a way that eases the overly tensed muscles for most of the day. It doesn’t always work, but it’s helped give me some control — and my life — back. ***** Today, while I still live with chronic pain, I can never say I’ve lost out because I learned so much in the process. If it’s true I’ve had more physical fortune in the past, then today I have more mental fortune. And the most important thing I’ve learned from this is that if there’s anything you want to change in your life, change your relationship with it. In fact, this is the only way to change anything. No, I can’t get rid of all my bad habits, thoughts, emotions or physical pain, but I can — and did — change my relationship with them all. I also created a better relationship with my body, my work and with Haley, who became my wife last year — and yes, she’s still the same radiant angel of joy as ever. Together we moved from New York to Fort Lauderdale, Florida and enjoy a healthy balance of work, friends and hobbies. I learned how to cope with stress better and achieved a minimum satisfactory level of functionality. I decided to focus only on the real estate business and simplified it dramatically — it still grew almost two times over the past five years (or maybe because of it…?). Finally, I learned the stoic lessons that have given so much to me. And like Epictetus spoke about above, I wanted to follow an ancient stoic tradition and write in praise of chronic pain. I still struggle with pain every single day, I still have very bad days and I’m still human, with many failings, weaknesses, and faults. But this is a stoic meditation, an exercise to help me continue changing my relationship with chronic pain and to give proper recognition to its rewards. Some words are mine, and some I’m paraphrasing from the best-known stoics like Epictetus and Seneca, or from the Marcus Aurelius Meditations. If you find any of it helpful or inspiring, then I encourage you to go read up on them right away. Because of chronic pain, I’ve learned the importance of restraint in my actions, my beliefs, and my thoughts. Restraint of the mind brings not only freedom from desires, but freedom from despair. And freedom from despair brings a space for peace in my life. How many more opportunities has my condition given me to toil in the name of freedom? FM Alexander called restraint in the body inhibition, and because of chronic pain, I’ve worked tirelessly to learn this skill. Physical inhibition has given me the power to melt down many of my muscular tensions through the power of thought, desire, and awareness directly and indirectly. These experiences taught me the value of both mental and physical vigilance. Likewise, no great virtue is ever attained without a constant vigilance. Therefore, be wary of the easy path. As Sri Ramakrishna said, “do not seek illumination unless you seek it as a person whose hair is on fire seeks a pond.” Because of my journey with chronic pain, I’ve had an endless source of spiritual fire to find my inner well of peace and tranquility not just in my body but in my mind. This journey has humbled me and taught me the dangers of self-importance. Excessive pride should be avoided. As William Irvine correctly observes, misfortune weighs most heavily on those who expect nothing but good fortune. I’m not immune to bad luck. Good fortune brought me face to face with how my sense of self-importance leads to anger. Illness makes us irritable and prone to anger. Acting on anger always leads to sorrow or regret. I’m grateful to Seneca for teaching me that every weakling is naturally prone to complaint and therefore to take each moment as an opportunity to practice patience to build my inner strength and character. It is easier to banish dangerous passions before they begin than to rule them afterwards. Just as in the body, the same is true in the mind. What I’ve lost in physical capacity and comfort, I’ve gained something back in mental ability and courage. This path has taught me that the most difficult decision I’ll ever have to make in life is to accept it. By welcoming my illness, I’ve learned to simplify every area of my life internally and externally. Simplifying my inner life has taught me not to desire more than is necessary and to avoid the excesses of fame, fortune, and vanity. Desires always lead to more desire, so I will never be satisfied until I’m courageous enough to accept this moment, as it is. And if I can’t accept this moment as it is right now, I can never have peace. Never trade your inner peace for something you have no control of. Because of my condition, I’ve chosen as my friends only good-natured, patient friends that are less likely to be angry or to provoke my anger. This has lead me to my wife Haley, where there is no better example of good nature, patience, and peacefulness. In turn, my wife Haley has lead us to live where there is warmer weather and sun. The moderate climate helps support my good spirits, even when things are not going my way. Seneca wisely observed, “it is useful for a man to understand his disease, and to break its strength before it becomes developed.” While I’ve done this unknowingly in my life, this new understanding has validated the importance of self-compassion… to forgive what I have no control over and to support and comfort my weaknesses, rather than punish them. The path of chronic pain has also taught me the importance of continually testing my limits, beliefs and assumptions. Just as self-compassion requires self-forgiveness, compassion also requires the continual exercise of mind and body. Strengths and weaknesses change day by day, moment by moment — and without the exercise of mind and body — both can become weaker and more susceptible to my condition. Just as a mother willingly bears the severe pain of childbirth for the greater purpose of bringing new life into this world, may I too find greater purpose in my daily struggle to bear willingly what’s naturally mine. Consider those who’ve accepted the loss of their freedom when they know they’ve committed a crime and consider, like so many others before you, how many times you’ve failed to resist the harsh judgement of others, to resist speaking badly about friends or family, or act selfishly or hurtfully to those who did you no wrong. And yet, I walk free. If I’m truthful to myself and my greater nature, I can certainly decide that I’ve committed moral crimes that deserve a harder measure than they’ve received. Many crimes escaped punishment simply because I wasn’t discovered or because the person I’ve hurt was more merciful than me, better in character or more forgiving. Therefore, whenever I feel unfairly punished, let me contemplate on the wrongs I’ve never admitted to or never apologized for but that I know exists deep down. Let me apologize for all of that, and for all the wrongs I’ve yet to commit. If I still can’t remember my own misdeeds, may I remember when others have done me wrong and I failed to forgive them and let my apology stand in its place. May these apologies prevent me from repeating my mistakes and purify my thoughts, for the purpose is great. Finally, my good fortune has lead me to earnestly search for wiser teachers, which I found in the ancient stoics. From them I’ve discovered the art and science of living with gratitude. To find happiness by embracing a small measure of sorrow and to keep it always close to my heart. Just as cold water causes the body to heat up, heavy weights cause muscles to grow and losing something brings an increased appreciation. Nature seeks to adapt contradictorily. When I get up in the morning, I wonder what would it be like if I didn’t have more than this hour left to live? How much would be left undone for myself and others? Or what if this were my last day with Haley and after tomorrow she was no longer in my life? How much joy would I never experience because my beloved wife was missing in it? How great would my emptiness be even years later? Throughout the day, there are countless miracles I get to appreciate. What would it be like if I didn’t have running water? How many other millions right now have to walk great distances for clean, drinkable water and don’t have the luxury to let it flow so freely and thoughtlessly? What would it be like if I had no arms, or no legs or no eyes or ears? Who would I have to rely on to help me leave the bed or leave my apartment, drive to places or feed me food? Could I endure such dependency for the rest of my life or the financial burdens it required? Could I learn to accept living without hearing the aching beauty of a Chopin nocturne or hear my wife’s voice and laughter? How long would it take me to safely move even small distances without sight or to do so without overwhelming fear? What could possibly replace the joy in my life of seeing the brilliant fire colors of the sky during a sunset from our balcony or driving along the I95? In this way, everything I interact with throughout the day is a chance to practice gratitude. When I speak, I’m grateful I still have a voice to connect with anyone I desire. When I write, I’m grateful I have the time and opportunity to create something that may last. When I search the internet, I’m amazed the whole of human knowledge is so quickly accessible to me where others are grateful to have even a single book. And when I say goodbye to a friend, I’m grateful to have another memory together, even if it’s destined to be our last — or more especially, because of it. May each daily experience bring such thoughts, until every moment becomes a moment of gratitude and inner prayer. For it is in my power of choice to think such thoughts and there’s much to be celebrated. And if there’s any advantage to be drawn from illness, it’s this: that it calls you to dig deeper into your soul and to find a spiritual satisfaction where the physical is lacking. And if there’s any advantage to be drawn from death, it’s that it calls you to live a good life. Because a good life equals a good death, no matter how long or how short. And so when death overtakes me, may I be writing such thoughts, reading such thoughts and thinking such thoughts. For more: www.MarcoBronx.com",2017
Should-do vs Want-to,"It is a constant battle inside me — to be or not to be? On one side there are the heavy-weights — all the people who seem to know what they are talking about, telling me to do this and that and convincing me upon what I should do. And on the other is my heart, who wants to go in a different direction altogether which mostly I don’t understand myself. It is absolutely crazy, goes from complete sense to non-sense in a microsecond. From wanting to visit art museums to watching porn to having conversations to running away from the world. I am perplexed! Now, who should I listen to? All the well-meaning people or my self. Where to invest my energies? I know everyone says I shouldn’t be afflicted by the ‘log kya kahenge?’ disease, but I care about what they will say, and their judgements do make a difference. You can’t trust your heart either, it keeps changing what it wants over time and sometimes even asks me to sabotage what I have created with effort; while promising me new ventures. And the worst part being that not listening to your heart can land you in deep emotional trouble. In this battle of heart vs. people, I am being torn apart, running here and there in search of redemption, listening to whatever comes on the way. Help I have been seeking inside (my self) and outside (ideas from individuals) because the anxiety disorder I have, is killing me with every passing hour and I wish to make something out of the life God has given me. Everything might, in the end, turn out to be inconsequential and all my worry a waste of time. The question is — will I be glad with what I get? Lately it’s dawned upon me that reaching a particular destination or achieving certain things does not lead to joy; it apparently is embedded in the process, what follows is mere emptiness. Yet constantly I strive to obtain a this and a that, what sense? I thought that if I do everything right then I will feel better, but it just doesn’t work out. For example, mechanical engineering; I suppose I should study since I am enrolled in the course, and it is my duty to this country and my parents to become a sound engineer, but the truth is — each day I spend trying to study engineering is like one stab at my soul. This entire concept of the perception in the eyes of the society has fucked up with my brain, and I can’t discern right from wrong anymore. Well, of course, certain people seem to be doing everything I am supposed to do and that too with ease and joy, while I struggle to put the basics in place; whether it be academics, or arts, or sports, or relationships, or anything. I don’t always like them. I can’t sit in the company of people for more than a while; it starts feeling claustrophobic unless it is gorgeous women one is talking about. I am bored of life’s pendulums of joy and sorrow, work and escape, people and loneliness, love and hate, peace and wrath, construction destruction, materialism and spirituality, so on. What’s the point of it without an output? I am tired of living the life this society propagates — for oneself. I want to live and do for others, from all the joys I have ever encountered — the best one was the one I received while giving. Am I equally selfish while trying to help others out in their path? Tell me how many people care about adding value while taking up a job; as far as I know, they all do it for the money. What sort of world is this? Does it even lead anywhere, each one for one’s self. I truly envy those who can chill, to whom the events of everyday life don’t seem to bother, who can just use their energies to do what they want anytime, who have no inertia and possess the calm that comes from knowing what you want and how to get it. — If you disagree with me then let me know, and if you think you can help me out then reach out ASAP (saurabhchopra2504@gmail.com) ❤",2017
Day 25 — Living With Anxiety,"My co-worker started spouting off the directions on how she got there, and my brain went into panic mode just listening to her talk about it. For someone who is used to driving, it probably sounded easy. But for me, it sounded like she was speaking Greek. I’m the type of person who goes by landmarks, rather than street names and numbers, when I’m going somewhere. Add in the added burden of anxiety when I drive anywhere outside the comfort of my city, and I’m a wreck. I had one previous experience leaving the city where the training will be held, during rush hour traffic, and it was terrifying. I told my co-workers that after that experience, I vowed never to do it again. I told them I have such bad anxiety when it comes to driving that I don’t go anywhere. When I took a trip to see my brother recently, who lives two hours away, I almost didn’t go because I was hit with an anxiety attack. It’s that bad sometimes. That’s when my co-worker piped up and said “It’s not that bad”. I asked him if he had anxiety, and he said “sometimes, I guess”. I have to tell you, in that moment, it took all the strength I had to not jump down his throat. It’s like saying to a diabetic “oh, go ahead and eat that whole chocolate cake. It’s not that bad for you”. Living with an invisible disease/ disorder is difficult to explain to someone who has never experienced it before. It is also difficult to have patience with someone who doesn’t understand what you’re going through. I could have tried to explain it to him, but where would I even begin? How do you explain the feelings of a racing heart? A mind racing with 1,000 worst case scenarios? The overwhelming fear? And, the feeling of wanting to bawl your eyes out while simultaneously feeling the need to curl up into a ball and hide? And forget about trying to explain social anxiety, or obsessive compulsive disorder, or PTSD. All of which I suffer from to one extent or another. So, instead of trying to explain, I simply said we can discuss the driving situation another day. I took myself out of the discussion before I had the chance to get defensive, which is another part of my anxiety. Taking myself out of the discussion today wasn’t a form of avoidance, it was a form of self-care. I recognized the feelings of anxiety bubbling up to the surface, and I chose not to engage those feelings. This is a form of mindfulness, which has helped a lot in overcoming my anxiety. By being mindful of what is going through my head, I am able to recognize the event or conversation that is triggering my response. For instance, today when we were talking about driving. My anxiety was triggered because I was thinking about the trip I took when I went to see my brother. When I can make the connection between the current event that is causing my anxiety, and link it to a similar past event, I am one step closer to overcoming that trigger. Overcoming my anxiety hasn’t been easy. Instead of burying my feelings of anxiety in alcohol, I’ve chosen to take a different path. Taking a hard look at my past hasn’t been easy either. But, it is a vital step in the healing process. By facing my past, and remembering tough memories, I am better able to work through that pain. In order to grow, I have to face and work through the pain, instead of burying it deeper inside of me. Thanks for reading!

The Anxious Traveler: How to Get Rid of Anxiety While You Travel,"Anxiety is crippling but the desire to see the beauty of the outside world may overcome that. I am an anxious traveler. I constantly deal with inflight panic attacks and hyperventilating in crowded places. But I still choose to travel… because I believe its worth it. Here are some ways in which I deal with my anxiety while I travel. Making a trip plan is essential to all backpackers and it is even more crucial for travelers with anxiety. These are things to consider when you make a trip plan. When you Google a famous tourist attraction, on the right side you can see the time of the day and the relative number of visitors. Plan your visit when the crowds are lighter. Aside from the fact that it is nicer in pictures, crowds can trigger anxiety and claustrophobia. Some people are bothered by the cold or are easily exhausted by the heat. Plan your trip according to the season. Know your body and remember to dress accordingly. Anxiety is sometimes triggered by exhaustion. Backpacking around a city means that you will get lost. Confusion in another country is quite tiring and may trigger anxiety. So make sure you won’t get exhausted. When you feel that you already have less than 25% of energy left then its time to recharge! If you get tired in the middle of the afternoon, rest inside a coffee shop and read about the city you are exploring. If its already late in the afternoon, call it a day and just start early the next day. There are some upsetting places that may cause anxiety. Examples of those are war memorials, caves, tunnels, and underground attractions. Make sure to avoid these on your first travel. Visit places that promote positivity instead. Small spaces may trigger anxiety. Capsule hotels and dormitory type rooms are quite popular these days but they should be avoided as closed spaces may induce claustrophobia. You can get AirBnb accommodations which is usually cheaper than hostels (but you have to be smart about booking). (1) something that calms you (2) something to keep your mind off things (3) offline maps and walking guides app (4) train stations and train routes app (5) pocket wifi (6) handy travel guide book (7) powerbank (8) roaming sim (for emergency calls) I hope this helps! I wish you good luck on your travels and may you courageously embark on wonderful adventures! ❤",2017
Icicles,"This is my life. Words are like little icicles melting in the sunlight. I might try to grasp at them, but they slip through my fingers. Once, long ago it seems, I could open my mind and the words would flow out, but something has happened. Once I was able to sit before the blank page, the glowing screen, and pour out my thoughts — sometimes like water over river stones, tumbling quickly, merrily; sometimes like honey, slow and steady, yet sweet — but now my thoughts stick in my rebellious mind. I sit down to write and I cannot find thoughts worth typing. This is my life. A few years ago I wrote a novel. I spent four years in school to earn a Literature degree so that I could write a novel worth reading. I was proud of that novel. But then, shortly after, the words stopped. It isn’t even that I don’t know how to say what I want to say; in truth, I do not feel that there is anything to say. I am dry; my imagination is a frozen tundra — no life, no warmth, nothing to see for miles around but bright white light. This is depression. There are so many things about depression that people don’t understand. Even people who have been depressed don’t know all the ways it can manifest. Some people are more creative when depressed. They live their lives inside a dream and record their mental travels for the world to share; they do this because they do not want to live in their real lives. I understand this. I don’t want to live my life, either. But for me, the depression also robs me of my imagination. I seek to escape the misery of my existence, but I cannot on my own. This is depression. Things have gotten bleak for me. I cannot work. I rarely smile. I have no humor. I am desperately lonely, but I have no thoughts to share with others. I no longer know how to speak to other human beings. My home feels strange and comfortless, as though it has been replaced with a replica in which all the colors and warmth have been muted and desaturated. Sometimes I do not feel quite real. It is as though I exist at a point two inches above and behind my head. Almost as though my conscious self is slipping away. This is depression. And it is ugly. It is not something that I want to see anymore. I tell myself it will pass, but I wonder if it is true. I see others who struggle through depression, and I wonder how they can still work, and smile, and laugh. I seem to have died, and my body did not notice. This is anxiety. I wonder how I will survive since I cannot work. This is anxiety. My mind is constantly flooded with the thought: ‘If only I could…, then I could help support my family.’ I wrack my brains trying to think of ways I can just get a handle on things. This is anxiety. The thought of leaving the house fills me with fear and dread. My heart races and dizziness overwhelms me. This is anxiety. This is life. But I am not beaten. Not yet. Not this time. I sit down to write and words come. I set my fingers, apprehensive, on the keys and I am shocked to see them fly. I can do this. I can catch the little icicles as they fall. They pierce me, make me bleed, but I have caught them. They are mine, and I cherish them. Now I must fight to keep them. If I do not, they will melt away and I will, once again, feel cold and dry and dead. This is life. Sometimes we must struggle on, knowing that we may yet fail. Sometimes we must be brave, even when every tiny hair on our bodies stands and quivers with fear. Sometimes we must look our demons in the eye and say, ‘Not today.’ I am not better yet. I still suffer, I still bleed. But sometimes, when I look out across the tundra of my imagination, I can see the things I missed before — the beauty of snowflakes as they drift, the quiet hardiness of a winter-white rabbit, the hint of shelter in a distant tree-line, and even the dazzling majesty of the Northern lights rippling overhead. This is life.",2017
My Lack of a Blood Bond,"I always knew I was adopted. It wasn’t sprung upon me in my teenage years causing to question my upbringing, nor did I find some conclusive sheet of paper which would turn my life upside down. It simply was a subject that was open for discussion at any point in time. I was 18 months old and had bounced around the foster care system since birth, and by the time I arrived at my parent’s home, not only was I emotionally and physically scarred but I was also aware that this was yet another family who might get rid of me like the rest had. I know I did not understand the word adoption, or perhaps even the concept, but I knew it felt different. My mom was up front with me from day one in explaining that I had a birth mom, but that I was chosen by them to be a part of their family. As I grew older she let me know that she would help me look for my birth parents if that was something I was interested in and over the years, curiosity popped in and out of my head…who did I look like? Who had the blue eyes? Who was responsible for my pudgy little fingers? While those questions were always at the back of my mind they never became much of a priority, unlike the constant nagging of the “why” question. All I knew at the time was my birth mother was young and unable to take care of me and given that none of my foster homes opted to keep me, there must have been something wrong with me, and the fear of being “given back” was a constant shadow in my mind.Growing up, there was not a lot of time or emotional space to think about finding my birth parents, as the domestic abuse in my home started when I was five and ended when I was 13. My sexual abuse, which occurred outside the home also started at five and ended at 14 and my mom was diagnosed with cancer when I was 13 and lost her battle after six long years. I was 19 when my mom passed away and although over the years, the curiosity of my origins had grown bigger, the guilt about doing it after my mom died was overwhelming and once again I pushed the issue to the back of my mind.In my early 20’s, I was given some information about an Ontario adoption registry that allowed both adopted children and their birth parents to register on a computer program which would then search for a match. I filled out the form, forgot about it and continued on with my life. Out of the blue, when I was 24 I received a big unmarked brown envelope which I proceeded to hand to my girlfriend at the time, told her to open it, thinking it may be a book from a college I had looked into, and ran in to get us coffee. Upon my return to the car, I find her in tears with the envelope in her hand saying “it’s your past”. To be honest I had forgotten completely about it and the shock set in as I started to read the first of the pages. My birth mother was half black, half Irish and because she had died that year in a fire I was given her identifying information, her name and birthdate etc. She had indeed been a young mother with a history of addiction and mental health problems. My birth father was of Italian descent with blue eyes and darker skin and there was very little other information about him. My birth mothers mom was still alive, and I was also informed I had two half-sisters, and with my permission and a few exchanges of letters, a meeting was set up. It is a very strange feeling to be handed family and expected to have some sort of instant connection simply because we share some DNA, especially considering that blood relations had never been a part of my life. As the meeting approached, I anticipated the many scenarios that could occur, and although I can say honestly that I wished for a close knit family, I went in with as few expectations as possible. It was odd to finally look at someone who has some sort of resemblance to me. My birth mothers mom was a kind, elderly lady who was just thrilled to meet her grandchildren, and like many people of that generation, was not willing to divulge much information about the past. My middle sister had actually lived with our birth mother on and off for five of six years, however following numerous suicide attempts, she was permanently removed and placed into foster care. My youngest sister has Fetal Alcohol Syndrome (FAS) complete with minor facial and hand deformities and is mentally challenged but was thrilled to meet her sisters for the first time. All in all, the meeting went well, and with the promise to remain in contact, we all went our separate ways. I noticed within the following weeks a sense of resentment and anger building up towards my birth mother. I get she could make a mistake and not have the ability or support to quit her addictions, and therefore would lose custody of me, but the fact is, she was given six months of after my birth to clean up and prove herself as a worthy parent. She was given supervised visitation rights which she repeatedly showed up high, or still drunk from the night before, and as the weeks passed, the visits lessened until one day, she just never came back. It started to eat at me, what type of woman could prioritize alcohol and drugs over her children, not just once, but three times. Why could she not have at least tried to get me back, not just wash her hands clean and get back to her routine, free from the burden of a screaming baby? How could the cycle just continue to repeat itself with no intervention until a child has to be born with mental deficiencies and physical deformities? Were there more than just the three of us? Perhaps someone who didn’t register, or did she finally figure out that birth control was not as rare a diamond? As I aged and became more aware of mental illness and addiction and the effects they can have on someone’s life, I began to be able to make a sense of peace with the anger I was feeling. Yes, I will always feel abandoned, but in this case, perhaps it really was the best scenario. My birth Grandmother passed away within a year of the meeting, and I would love to say I have two sisters who I am super close with, but despite my numerous efforts to reach out, the reality has become Christmas or Birthday text, usually initiated by me, and often lacking a response. I have made peace with that as well. I have no expectations of either of them, and as I said, you can’t just put three strangers in a room and because of one common factor, a birth mother, expect a bond to form instantly, or in this case, at all. I care about them of course, but do I love them? Hard to love someone you don’t know. A blood bond means nothing to me. A chosen bond means the world.",2017
Exposure Therapy: Why Going to the Gym has become more mentally difficult than physically.,"For the past year it’s become increasingly difficult for me to get to the gym. It used to be my “happy place.” It was a place I could go to blow off steam and be completely alone with my music and my body. Now I find myself dreading the trip. On the rare occasion that I get there, I feel paranoid, anxious and overwhelmed. It’s been a source of immense frustration for me these past few months. I attributed my lack of gym-time to laziness or fear of the process of trying to get in shape again. Boy was I wrong. It finally clicked for me this weekend when I had a nightmare involving the gym. I was staying at my parents house a few hours from my own home, and I dreamt that I was at the gym. Nothing crazy happened, I was just there. Then I went home and found out my boyfriend had committed suicide. Not only that, but my mom told me “he did it because you said he wouldn’t.” I woke up feeling sick. I then remembered that the gym was there… why was the gym there? It was so irrelevant to the dream itself, but why, why was it there? Once I woke up I had a sudden urge to go to the gym near my parents house. Seizing the sudden desire, I bolted out the door. I spent about an hour there, a feat I hadn’t conquered in months. In a state of mental lapse I found myself looking for a friend of mine who I would often see at that very gym, but had taken his life a year ago. The reality of my aversion to the gym hit me like a train. I ran to the locker room and realized that the day my brother died, I had gone to the gym after work instead of going straight home. Had I not, I would have been there when my mom found my brothers body. Two years later, my childhood friend and gym-buddy took HIS life. The only time I saw him after 8th grade was at the gym, and we’d laugh and reunite and talk about how things used to be. It’s no wonder that the gym scares me now. I’ve begun to associate it with death, and overall shittyness. If I go there, I’m anxious and paranoid that something terrible will happen to me or someone I love. I’ve been binge-watching Friends for the 1 millionth time, and I have to laugh at an episode I recently watched where Phoebe refuses to go to the dentist because every time she does, someone she knows dies. It seems humorous and irrational, but her fear is real to her, and it’s real to me. It makes me roll my eyes that I’ve watched this episode probably 15 times in the past two years, and never realized that I was going through exactly what Phoebe was. Now that I understand that my anxiety is rooted in more than just laziness, I’ve decided to start going to the gym as a means of exposure therapy: “Exposure therapy is a technique in behavior therapy used to treat anxiety disorders. It involves the exposure of the patient to the feared object or context without any danger, in order to overcome their anxiety and/or distress.” It will be a difficult process for sure, but a journey I’m eager to go on. I look forward to the day when I can go to the gym without worry of disaster, and focus on bettering myself one rep at a time. (I had to end with a cheesy joke, this post was all too serious.)",2017
~9:27am,"Silence is war. It breaks you slowly from within and you never see it coming. Not you, not anyone else. For what silence does is plant a seed deep down which then flourishes until a tree, and then a forest, populates your soul with the fruits of a mild sense of despair. It never fully comes to life, in the same way that most things that our brains create never do. Silence is peace. It clears all that is external until all that remains is the suffocating presence of crowds of one — a crowd of you. A meeting, a protest, a debate, all happening within the four walls of the top floor in the headquarters of this multinational conglomerate called life. But after conflict comes resolution, even if meetings do tend to overrun. Oh, how they overrun, often for years at a time. Some never end until it’s all over anyway. Silence is war. We have dreams and desires which comfortably sit in the womb of our ideology, but to give birth to them is to recognise that pain will come. And frustration. Often, death. Not of the self, but of the self that could have been. Or maybe it’s confirmation that it never was. For we are the best investigators when the job is to prove ourselves unworthy, lucky scavengers of what life threw at us while we were too busy to look, being busy, always busy. What is life but a series of busy events. Busy is good. Busy is bad. Busy is everything until we’re left with nothing. Silence is peace. It cleanses the chaos of the world until all that’s left is the chaos of the mind. It clears the room out of the avalanche of thoughts until all that’s left is a little, fragile hut of what hurts. What feels. What remains. If only it could stay forever. For war and peace are nothing but moments. Moments before you need more peace and war.",2017

"Pulse Rates, Pee Cups and Presidential #*@#$","Trump said he would bring back jobs? I lost my new job in refugee resettlement today precisely because of Trump. – Last night Carp and I had a discussion about the events of the week, and he was openly panicking about everything happening, while my pulse hardly rose at all. Am I a sociopath? I thought I don’t think so. I think I do well in crisis situations, as long as blood, guts and shit are not involved. I feel like I am doing all I can right now, really throwing myself into the world to learn about it, and change with it. And I don’t believe that being bitter or upset is going to change anything, so I just am not feeling those emotions quite yet. I know I can be more productive and helpful if I stay level headed about the country. If I keep moving. – Flash to this morning. I wake up and find that there is still warm coffee in the french press from when Ben went to work. I grab a mug and head over to my laptop, with the intent of watching Democracy Now! I check my email first, and see a few urgent emails from the HR department at the new refugee resettlement agency I’m beginning work at on Monday. “Call me as soon as possible. Very urgent information.” This cannot be good. With the week that the nation has had, and with this being the day that I am to sign my name on a paper to receive full health insurance and dental along with a sweet new job that I get to learn about the people of the world as well as help them learn about America: this cannot be good. I think about just not calling, because I already know what she will say. But I pick up the phone and call anyway. “Hello! Good morning, how are you?” “Good… thanks….” “Because of the executive order Donald Trump ordered last week, we are rescinding our employment offer for the refugee resettlement team. I’m sorry. I bet you had a feeling it was coming, though…. Please keep checking our website for possible openings, hopefully after 120 days.” My voice cracks a little bit as I tell her goodbye. I hang up the phone and stare at the wall for a split second, then break down crying. I haven’t cried this spontaneously in a while. I hauled ass driving across three states yesterday so that this morning I could wake up and go to a drug and TB test to begin my new life as a Refugee Employment Specialist. Now, because of a sad old man who dyes what’s left of his hair orange in a desperate attempt to be noticed, I am unemployed. What does this mean now? The profession I thought I would immerse myself in for the next few years is now laying off their workers, and will become a hard business, if still a business at all to get into. Is this the point where I give up working in refugee resettlement for awhile, or is this the point where I fight harder than ever to stay in it? I check my pulse to see if it’s started to race now, but it still feels the same. I feel in shock. The only giveaway is the crazy sweating under my arm pits that happens whenever I am excited or nervous. I realize I am let down, but I am not ready to hate someone, or even the system. I feel a certain numbness from the system and those that run it, mostly because I half expect the worst from them, so when it happens, I take it and move on. I never give them my trust, and I have learned to try to never give them my power. I accept this decision, which is probably the best choice for the agency, and the refugees that they serve. And my brain begins to come up with possible ways to continue to be involved with the refugee community, and where will I get money, and the fact that now I can write more, and at least I was offered the job so I know I deserve one in the future, and goddamn it- I’m going to watch Amy Goodman and see what’s happening on Democracy Now! while I make a list of personal actions my boyfriend and I can take to actively be involved toward social justice, peace and cultural competency. I am not the president’s puppet. And I will not respond in chaos the way that I know he wants us to. I am going to do what I can right here and right now, and I am going to hurt Trump’s ego first and foremost by not letting him get to me, but instead continuing to live my life the way I want to, loving the people of the world. And, I mean, at least I didn’t have to pee in a cup before they told me my job was kaput, right? – The truth is, I’ve been waiting for this day for a long time- the day when the majority of the population can’t help thinking about the hard issues constantly. When radical leftists, democrats, moderate and independents and even some conservatives can take to the streets together and say, “We want to change as a Nation! We stand up for all human rights, and we are not going to stand for your bureaucratic, bombastic, bellicose bullshit!” I’m going to start blogging about these issues in the coming future, and ways that we can all get involved as a community. We cannot feel helpless, we all have a part in this country, in this world, and we cannot feel defeated. For now, I have decided to focus my efforts on media. I can up with a short list of things I could actively do today to get started: 1: Keep a blog I am intuitively drawn toward channeling all my thoughts into a blog. I have been seeing “Medium” blog accounts shared on facebook recently, and decided to try my hand at it, in addition to this wordpress blogpost. Upon exploring Medium, I saw a post by Lewis Wallace which resonated with me: https://medium.com/@lewispants/i-was-fired-from-my-journalism-job-ten-days-into-trump-c3bc014ce51d#.x9dzldfx6 Solidarity. Needless to say, I was sold for Medium. I have previously been avoiding social media- I had deleted my facebook and was completely immersed in books. I am reminded of something my friend Ryan said when I was passing through Denver a few years ago. We were talking about social media, and I was currently on a purge from it back then as well. He told me that he didn’t think avoiding it completely was the answer, as social media was helpful in many ways. Similar to someone who is trying not to abuse drugs or alcohol, taking it away completely just makes it more forbidden. It doesn’t strengthen your resolve and commitment to yourself to not drink when you’re not around it. Same with social media, he said. Use it as you must, exist with it, and prove it doesn’t have power over you. 2: Support other writers You can find his blog at (https://theavidfan.wordpress.com/). Because, the other part of my resolution for fighting propaganda is promoting freelance journalists who are kicking ass! 3: Submit timely pieces to newspapers/magazines In other forms of Media, I submitted my first opinion piece to the Kansas City Star and was published three days later! It’s not as hard as I imagined, and I imagine I will continue submitting. 4: Watch/Listen to/Read/Support Independent New Sources -I.e. Democracy Now! In regards to direct actions outside of writings, protests and rallies are increasingly coming under attack in the US. According to Democracy Now! today: “More anti-protest laws being pushed by lawmakers across the country. In Iowa, lawmakers have introduced a bill that would make blocking traffic a felony punishable up to 5 years in prison. Minnesota lawmakers are pushing an anti-protest bill that would allow cities to sue protesters in order to charge them for the cost of policing the demonstrations. In North Dakota, lawmakers have introduced a bill that would allow drivers to ‘accidentally’ run over and kill protesters blocking traffic. Washington state lawmakers are pushing a bill that would label protests as ‘economic terrorism.’ And Indiana, Republican legislators have introduced a bill that would empower police to remove protesters blocking traffic using ‘any means necessary’ legislation, activists have dubbed the ‘block traffic and you die’ bill. New bills come more than 200 activists are facing more than 10 years in prison on felony riot trials for protesting Trump’s inauguration.” Finally, we cannot have good media or good community actions/protests without intersectionality, something that I will dive into deeper in further blog posts, but always try to incorporate in some way into all my blog posts. Intersectionality comes out of feminist theory and is a way to bring all the movements together, showing all social justice is connected, and you cannot have one without another. According to google, intersectionality is: “the interconnected nature of social categorizations such as race, class, and gender as they apply to a given individual or group, regarded as creating overlapping and interdependent systems of discrimination or disadvantage.” Intersectionality is about understanding, and terror is about taking away that understanding. Our country has been using terror to shape its foreign and domestic policy since I can remember, separating us from one another instead of bringing us together in our struggles to live together in the world. Growing up in the George W. Bush regime, my brother and I were told by my parents that he was using scapegoating and creating fear in the populace to gain more power. Things haven’t changed since then, they’ve just progressed and become more extreme. And so things haven’t changed in the way that I view the government, and maybe that’s why my blood pressure is not rising as much as others my age and younger. I expected this from our country from a very young age, and have been doing what I can when I can to make my own difference, but I know that I’m not going to change it all at once, all alone. Which brings me back to how I started this blog post. Am I a sociopath because I am not panicking? I lost my job to the Trump administration today, and I may not have the same future of working with the international community in our country ever again because of this administration. But I see myself and others existing within and without the system. We will do what we can to call it out, to help each other out, and to learn and relax, but we will not be able to help those in power out. They will do what they will do, and the greatest act of resistance I think I can do is keep my blood pressure normal, and keep acting in the way that I believe in and want the world to look. – Later, in the desperation of the newly realized unemployed person, I sent an email asking if there was any way they could contact me after 120 days if they are still looking to fill the position, and she responded to me right away. “If things are lifted and we are able to hire; you will be the first one we call to hire; we are not sure how long that will be. We will also probably reshuffle current employees for new positions before hiring anyone new again. I have no problem with you keeping in contact with me though.” I eat lunch and begin watching Democracy Now! , and realize that my heart is beating harder now. I am upset. This is too much. I am overloaded with social injustices, and it has all hit very close to home today with the surgical removal of my new job from my life, and the drastic changes that are affecting most of the county.",2017
Time to talk — speaking out about mental health,"So what’s this Time to Talk day business all about? It’s about us, all of us, every last one of us. 1 in 4 people will directly experience mental health issues in their lifetime, so the chances are if you don’t experience it personally someone close to you will. Time to Talk day is about raising awareness, breaking down the stigma and supporting one another. If we don’t talk about it we can’t help each other. Attitudes towards mental health are changing because of campaigns like this and the work of organisations such as Heads Together and Mind. There is still a long way to go and it all starts with talking, with having those conversations, with not being afraid to ask for help and for equipping ourselves to offer help when it’s needed. Conversations truly do save lives, think about that, the power we all have to make such a huge difference, it’s incredible. This isn’t rocket science stuff either, it’s making time to sit down and have a cuppa with someone, to drop them that message to let them know you are there, to ask them how they feel and most importantly to really listen. Businesses and organisations in Nottingham are also doing their bit. Circle Nottingham & Doncaster & Bassetlaw hospitals NHS foundation trust have pledged to increase awareness through promoting health and wellbeing in the workplace and many more across the UK will be joining them. In uncertain times when we might feel it’s a fight to get our voices heard this really is an area where one person can make all the difference. Join us and get talking!!!!

How to Manage Stress On-Campus,"A full course load can be difficult to juggle with needing to remember class times and locations, seminar sessions, essay deadlines, and exam dates. It can then become more difficult when these tasks begin to build and the semester is in full swing. To help organize your life, purchase an agenda or download a time-management app. This will help you to plan your day-to-day activities and help determine how much time you can afford to spend on each task. Many schools have gyms on-campus with free (or heavily discounted) memberships to students. Not only is exercise amazing for your body, but it works wonders for your mind. Sweating out toxins and allowing your brain to focus on something other than the rest of your day is a great way to press pause and work off negative energy. Certainly, stress can become overbearing and really flood your mind with anxious thoughts and overwhelming negativity. When this occurs, it is important to find a way to express these emotions without fear of judgement or embarrassment. By exploring your campus’ services, you’ll likely find that there are counsellors available on a daily basis. By booking a free appointment and scheduling this into your day, you’ll feel at ease when you can express your concerns and receive professional advice, guidance, and reassurance. When school life gets stressful it can be difficult to take a break due to the guilt and anxiety it can cause… after all, your time could be better spent working on assignments or studying, right?

Taking Care of Little Me,,2017
Resilience Alone Won’t Get Us Through—We’ll Need To Open Up,"Early on in our relationship, my husband slipped while trying to peel a potato, caught the knife in his hands, and brutally severed most of the tendons in his fingers. When we returned home from the emergency room that night, I watched him calmly return to the sink, scrub his blood off of the potato with his other hand, cook it, and eat it. “I couldn’t let it beat me,” he announced in between victorious bites. This is how we came to use “eating the potato” as a catch-all description for any resilience/fortitude/devouring of enemy hearts that we were trying to accomplish in our lives. Every time a combination of life, a tenacious anxiety disorder, and my various other issues conspired to make me feel more like a tendon than a knife, I would try my hardest to live up to the “eat the potato” ethos. Recently, in the comparatively utopian era known as “three weeks ago,” I had to go outside and do some banking. So I attempted to eat the potato. This shouldn’t have been a particularly complicated or daunting task. I am able-bodied and relatively healthy. I have, in the past, been perfectly capable of grabbing a coffee, going to a bank, doing bank things, and then going home again. But going outside gets a little more precarious for me in the winter. Cold urticaria — a rare allergy that causes my body to break out in burning hives when exposed to the cold — leaves me stranded inside for long periods of time. My autistic brain starts to get a little too comfortable with my low-key hermitage and makes everything outside of my apartment feel increasingly unfathomable and daunting — which, in turn, makes my necessary re-entries into that world feel like Herculean efforts. It took me a solid day to gird my loins for this particular outing, and I still walked out of the door with a heart rate and sweat production level more common to high intensity cardio than a stroll to my local branch. As I started to get back into the rhythm of life on the outside, though, I started to fear it less. I grabbed a cappuccino at my favorite coffee shop and had a thoroughly pleasant social interaction with the barista. I even liked the music they were playing. Then I did my banking and had another pleasant passing social interaction with the teller. Just as I found myself thinking ‘Hey, maybe venturing out of my apartment isn’t a nonstop parade of pain and humiliation,’ I spilled cappuccino all over the floor. But just as I found myself thinking “Hey, maybe venturing out of my apartment isn’t a nonstop parade of pain and humiliation,” I caught the bottom of my coffee cup caught on a pen chained to the bank counter, sending a good 14 ounces of steamed milk and espresso splashing all over the bank floor. In stunned horror, I asked the closest teller if there was someone I should speak to or some cleaning materials they could give me to deal with the spill. After a long, drawn-out pause, the teller said “Well, I think they’re changing the floor mats soon.” I asked if there was someone I should speak to or some cleaning materials that they could give me for the 90% of my coffee that hadn’t fallen on the floor mats. Again, the teller told me that someone would be picking up the mats, so I could probably just leave that part. theestablishment.co The rest of my bank visit unfolded like a Kafka story reimagined by Richard Ayoade: a dark, wryly hilarious nightmare. I was eventually handed one sheet of paper towel (I later found and commandeered an entire roll), and set about wiping my coffee and my pride off of the floors, in front of an audience of three staring bank employees and two Statler-and-Waldorf-esque old customers who sat and picked apart my cleaning skills the whole time. I tried to ignore the criticism and not dwell on how fantastically wrong my tiny adventure in adulthood had gone, and I almost made it. But as I wiped the last off my mess off of the floor, one of my observers spoke up: “You missed some on the mat.” Instead of reminding her of my special non-mat-wiping dispensation, I looked at her — I even made eye contact with her — and declared “I HAVE AUTISM AND CHRONIC ANXIETY AND I HAVEN’T LEFT THE HOUSE IN DAYS AND I AM ABOUT TO LOSE IT.” Then I immediately fulfilled my promise and ran out of the bank in tears. I stumbled homeward sobbing. I was humiliated by what had happened but, more than that, I was viciously disappointed in myself. I hated that leaving the house had been an issue at all, and I loathed that it had taken so little to throw me so completely off balance. theestablishment.co About halfway home, though, I realized that I was also upset about the loss of coffee. That one, I could actually fix. So I turned around and took my tear-stained face and hollowed-out ego back to the coffee shop and ordered another cappuccino. “You’re back!” the barista noted, and because I’d pretty much lost whatever filter I usually have that makes me respond to superficial polite neurotypical queries with superficially polite answers and I just didn’t care anymore, I decided that I was going to explain why — every darkly humorous detail. She was sympathetic — she offered to make me another coffee to go throw all over the bank floor in vengeance — so I kept talking. It turned out that she had anxiety, too, so we traded coping tips and gallows humor, and tried, with moderate success, to get each other to give ourselves some credit for what we had accomplished by leaving the house that day. And then I went home with a new coffee that I didn’t drop and a willingness to once again consider that venturing out of my apartment isn’t a nonstop parade of pain and humiliation. “You ate the potato,” my husband declared when I told him about my day. But I’m not convinced that this is a story about resilience at all. The thing that really saved me, besides a desire for more coffee, was a willingness to admit I wasn’t okay. Being openly vulnerable in public — even just a little vulnerable to a friendly near-stranger — was what helped me at every step of my post-spill day. I let myself be miserable and embarrassed and admit that I felt that way to another person. I didn’t try to shrug it off or minimize how disproportionately hard it felt for me, and I didn’t try to put a more positive spin on it. If she hadn’t responded in anxiety-ridden solidarity — even if she’d laughed at me or made that mildly polite face normal people have been making at me and my unique verbal tangents for most of my life — I still would have felt relieved that I wasn’t holding onto that shit by myself any longer. The thing that really saved me was a willingness to admit I wasn’t okay. I let myself be miserable and embarrassed and admit that I felt that way to another person. Three weeks later, most of this feels embarrassingly trivial. I would gladly endure multiple coffee-based bank humiliations to escape the overbearing existential dread that I feel now, and I’d suffer through even more if it could spare anyone from the racist, dangerous, and vindictive policies that are rapidly tearing apart America and threatening to destroy the world. The lesson I took from that day still sticks with me, though. Resilience isn’t what is going to get anyone with any empathy through this. The onslaught, which has been designed to demoralize and break us, is too powerful to ride out on internal strength and potato-eating alone. We’re all going to need breaks. We’re all going to break. And I believe that allowing yourself the space to do that, and to do it together, actually does have the ability to sustain us. Even if it doesn’t end in a moment of bonding — although there’s a good shot at that, given how fucked up so many of us are right now — the simple act of admitting that you’re not okay still has benefits. Forcing yourself to be strong, to appear like you have it all together — and beating yourself up when you’re not — takes a fantastic amount of effort. If you allow yourself to stop doing any of those things, even for a few minutes, you can save that energy for more important things, like taking care of yourself and preparing for the fight ahead. The world, as I understand it today, is in fact an almost nonstop parade of pain and humiliation. But when I allow myself to step outside of it with whatever combination of panic, fear, frustration, and heartbreak that knowledge brings me — and admit how I’m feeling in a way that neither attempts to prioritize other people’s comfort over my own, nor expects any specific response or support from those people in return — I sometimes have just enough left in my psychological tank to feel like there might be a break in the parade. And that’s something I can work with right now. theestablishment.co",2017
My Panic Attack on the Mountain,"The thunder snapped, like a giant popping his knuckles. I jumped, my heart racing. Turning around, I saw a sight that made my heart drop to my REI-purchased hiking boots. A giant black storm cloud was rapidly overtaking the next peak, headed our way. “One, two, three, four, five, six…okay, six miles away. That’s not close. That’s not close.” I instantly reverted to my fourth-grade self, using the very scientific method of counting seconds between thunder and lightning to gauge how far away the storm was. I wondered if maybe in Italy, I should be measuring in kilometers, something I could never convert effectively. Debbie and I stopped to cover our backpacks with our rain covers, and donned our rain coats. So far we’d been lucky: besides a light shower we quickly got out of, the weather had been fantastic on our week in the Dolomites. I felt our luck had run out. The fact that we had already had a long day trekking from Prolongia to just below Lagazuoi, where we’d hoped to get accommodations for the night, added to my stress. No such luck. I cursed my effort to be easy, breezy when I agreed with Debbie that we’d wing it instead of making reservations. Back at the base of Lagazuoi, we’d plopped down outside of the gift shop/café and called Rifugio Nuvolau to see if there were beds available. There were, but the owner, a Canadian, our Dolomite tour book told us, urged us to be there by 5 pm. It was 3 pm, and we’d just sat down with food and beer. It would only take an hour and a half, she said. Days before we’d learned not to take anyone’s estimate for hiking time into consideration. Every time we saw a sign that told us it would take just an hour and a half to a spot, it took us three hours. (We decided they timed professional hikers for those signs, not Americans carrying 20-pound backpacks who were unaccustomed to altitude). So I wasn’t comfortable with our odds of arriving on time. And I hate being late. As we walked as fast as we could away from civilization and into the mountains, I fantasized that the stern Canadian would lock the doors and forbid us from entering. We’d have to sleep shivering outside. I sped up. By the time the storm bubbled over the mountain, I was tired and stressed, with probably another 2 hours of hiking — completely uphill, by the looks of it — ahead of us. The storm wasn’t easing my anxiety. Carrying hiking poles, I realized, was like carrying lightning rods. Rain I could handle, but damn if I was going to be struck by lightning and die on a mountain in Italy. I had a nonrefundable yoga retreat I’d paid for! As I walked like a turtle on caffeine behind Debbie, I began panting. After a few minutes, I realized my breathing was overkill for the incline. That’s when it occurred to me that I was hyperventilating. When I saw what looked like a rock slide in our path and spied the trail marker along the way, I lost it. Full-on panic attack. Debbie, realizing that I was not okay, sat me on a rock. I couldn’t even talk to explain that while I knew in my mind that being in a storm was not the end of the world, my body couldn’t jibe with that thought. My body was shutting down. No more. I’m done. Just bury me under that rock right there and save yourself. I’d never had a panic attack before, I thought, but then I dislodged the memory, seven months ago, of my actual first panic attack. The end of my marriage. A day I’d rather not relive, but there I was, sitting on a rock in the middle of Italy, a storm speeding my way, and I was back there, curled in a ball, unable to get ahold of myself as my life shattered into a million pieces. That wasn’t going to happen again, I willed. I’d survived the impossible since that moment when everything in my life pivoted, and I would survive this. Debbie gave me electrolyte water and nuts, and my body regulated itself. Not wanting to let the storm get any closer, I waved her on, took a deep breath, and marched on. I took one step. Then another. And another. I focused just on the rock in front of me. I didn’t look up to see how much further we had to go to reach the crest. I worried if I saw, I’d break down again. I began chanting in my head “I am here. I am here.” Storm or not, I was exactly where I wanted to be. In the Dolomites, hiking with a friend. Moving forward with my life, though the formula had changed. Finding peace within myself. I am here. When we walked on a narrow trail just inches from the edge of a cliff, I regained my focus. I shut out thoughts of what would happen if I slid down, out of reach. The pressing storm nudged me on. When we spied the rifugio, it was so high up another mountain, my inner tantrum toddler wanted to give up, but I used the sight of it as motivation to keep going. Up, up, up we climbed, and when we finally reached the top, I understood why people kiss solid ground when they arrive somewhere by boat. I’d been in tumultuous seas, battling with the choppy waves of my mind, and I’d finally gotten to shore. I didn’t even mind that there was an outdoor squat toilet and no shower. You know what the funniest part is? It never rained on us. But elsewhere, our fellow hikers were pelted by golfball-sized hail. Maybe we were lucky after all.",2017
Perfectionism almost killed me,"Do you live in a world with no room for mistakes? Do you beat yourself up over not reaching your own high standards? If the answer is yes, then perhaps you have met my old friend, perfectionism. I’ve probably always suffered from depression and anxiety, but it was only at the age of 28 that I finally got some help. I remember as a kid being told by elderly relatives that I needed to smile more. My grandfather once even described me as a ‘melancholy child.’ Which, does make it sound a lot like I grew up in a Dickens novel. In fact, I had quite a happy childhood, but I was just a very thoughtful, dreamy kid who often felt like she had the weight of the world on her shoulders. As a teenager, everyone just put it down to hormones. The depression became hidden amongst all that teenage angst. During those years, I never felt good enough and I found more and more elaborate ways to hurt myself. Things levelled out in adulthood and I was lucky enough to have a few good years. I still had episodes of self-harm and drank heavily, but I was otherwise relatively stable. Then I met my arch-nemesis. Perfectionism. I didn’t recognise them at first. They introduced themself to me as a friend, someone who would help me climb all kinds of ladders: the property ladder, the career ladder, real ladders… Yet, all the while they were dismantling my fragile mental health and making me feel like nothing was ever good enough. I had to keep constantly moving forward in the search of some kind of satisfaction. On social media I had to cultivate the perfect image, at work everyone had to like me, I would struggle to finish projects and assignments, because they weren’t perfect. I had to be the best. I had to be the very best. If I made even the smallest mistake, I would beat myself up about it for weeks. Then I was offered an exciting new job. The rational part of my brain was screaming at me that it was a bad idea. It was based 70 miles away from my home. I knew that it would be a thankless and frankly impossible role. I knew it would be exhausting and challenging, but my perfectionism and pride forced me to do it. It was very nearly the death of me, and probably the worst decision of my life. Depression can be an insidious bastard. It can creep up on you and kidnap you in the night or it is like being in a pan of slowly boiling water and not realising that you are being cooked alive until it is too late. I was aware that life had lost its joy. I was aware that I hadn’t laughed or felt happy in months. I just didn’t especially care. I was so riddled with anxiety about what would happen if I stopped moving forward. Now, this isn’t the easiest part to read. If talk of suicide is distressing or triggering for you, please skip the next paragraph. So, I began to fantasise about how I could stop it all, without sacrificing my pride. Pride, what a stupid thing; it only serves the person who thinks they have it. It is certainly not worth dying for. I thought about how I could make it look like an accident. I would drive my car off the road. In my delusional state I thought that it would be ok, because it would only serve to illustrate how exhausted I had been from working so hard and commuting so far down such dangerous roads. Most importantly, if it looked like an accident, I thought that no one would think that I had depression. My husband had watched my mental state deteriorate over several months. In other words, he had watched his wife turn into a zombie. He’d become desperately worried and was this lone voice in the darkness, telling me that I needed to get help. He’d suspected what I was planning, and would understandably freak out if I was ever late home from work. Unfortunately, going to the doctor, was about the worst thing I could imagine. I didn’t know anyone with depression. I assumed that you went to the doctor and they either dismissed you for wasting their time or strapped you into a straight jacket and took you away in a white van. I thought that whatever scenario played out, I would end up with a big, black mark against my name in a file somewhere that said ‘Depressed.’ When I finally hit rock bottom, I knew I had to do something. It’s a fairly long, complex (and probably boring) story, so I’ll simplify what happened that led me to get help. My boss had recommended that I got some anonymous 360 feedback from colleagues to help with my personal development. I told her that I wasn’t feeling ‘mentally robust enough for that right now.’ She didn’t listen. The feedback came in, I freaked out, rolled into a little ball and cried. Got angry. Screamed something along the lines of “You don’t f####g own me. I am a person.” Shut my laptop. Turned my work phone off. Called the doctor. By this point, things had got to the point that I was having panic attacks multiple times a day. In the office, toilet breaks had been replaced with ‘freaking the fuck out’ breaks. Every time I thought about work I would get these intense stabbing pains in my stomach and feel faint and breathless. [Warning, again, possible triggering content: Please skip to the next paragraph] I was in a very dark and unhappy place full of unsettling and violent thoughts. I would fantasize about cutting off my hands with machetes and stabbing swords and knives into my stomach. Luckily, my doctor was fantastic. My husband had come with me because I couldn’t face it alone. We were new to the area, and I had never met my GP before. I needed back-up. My mouth has never felt drier than the moment I had to explain what was wrong. I couldn’t find the words. With a sympathetic ear and the right questions, he got it out of me. From then on, I knew that I had made the right decision. He signed me off work for an initial couple of weeks and encouraged me to seek further help through medication and Cognitive Behavioural Therapy. I have since quit my job to pursue a writing career, and you’ll be pleased to hear, I’m doing much, much better. Not perfectly, but only because I stopped chasing that mirage. If you are concerned that you are developing a mental health problem you should seek advice from your doctor as a matter of priority. If you are in distress and need immediate help and are unable to see a GP, you should visit your local A&E.

This 3-Step Mindfulness Practice Can Help When Reading the News Feels Terrible,"These days it’s easy to get caught up in CNN and the latest executive orders. It’s overwhelming. The news today is not only shocking, it’s anxiety provoking and energy zapping. Social media can also magnify our stress. Many of us fall prey to it’s addicting force. Before we know it, we’ve just spent 2 hours on Facebook — and what good actually came of that? It’s easy to waste precious hours and our vital life force in front of our newsfeed. We all know the angst of spending too much time on the internet. Of feeling distracted, irritated and distraught by what we read and consume. Yes, it’s important to be aware and to be engaged, but at what cost? How can keep our focus while being aware of what’s happening politically? How do we garner ourselves and find the energy we need to skillfully respond to conflict and handle the weight of our everyday responsibilities? It is possible, through mindfulness, to contain our life force. This means being vigilant, especially with our attention. The practice of mindfulness allows us to constantly aware our own thoughts, emotions and feelings in the present moment. This continuous awareness helps us to stay anchored in our center and not get swept away and influenced by everything that’s swirling around us. Reclaim your attention and energy with this 3-Step mindfulness reading practice: Before reading the news, focus on taking 3–5 slow deep breaths. Relax your body. Ground yourself like a big tree with deep roots moving into the Earth. Find your center with each breath. Become grounded and centered. Gather all of your attention into your body and into the present moment. Again, visualize the tree, stable and rooted. Before opening USA Today or FaceBook, think about why you’re reading news and how much time you want to spend reading, posting or engaging. Decide how you want to relate to the news and in a way that would best serve you. For example, tell yourself, “I’ll spend 5–10 minutes now reading the news.” By setting an intention, you set a healthy boundary and limit your time on your newsfeed. As you’re reading the news, pay close attention to your breath, your body and your emotions. Do you notice inner-gripping? What about your emotional state? See if your breath becomes shallow and tense. Become aware of your body and how you feel. Observe what you’re fully experiencing without judgment. Pay close attention to your inner-state as you read the news. 1) Am I getting lost in the news? 2) What skillful action can I take now? 3) What would be conducive for my time and energy in respect to myself and the whole? Tracking your breath, body and emotions will help you raise self-awareness, which in turn will allow you to choose more consciously how you spend your time and energy. With so much noise and negativity flying around, it’s essential to do what we can to stay centered and calm. It’s from that place of calm center that we can most skillfully respond to our environment and what’s truly needed. We cannot afford to be distracted or scattered. It’s vitally important to cultivate clarity and focus in times of global conflict and challenge. Begin your day with a simple practice of mindfulness. Choose how you want to spend your time and attention. Direct your own energy instead of being directed by outer influences. Remember this 3-step mindful reading practice and experience the lasting benefits of being clear, whole and focused.

Life with mental illness: A Depersonalization Story,"I remember the day my mental illness, Depersonalization Disorder, developed; it was spring, my graduating year of high school. My mother was away visiting family while my father remained at home, which is ironic, considering he spent most of my life away from home in another province working, and committing infidelity and when he was at home he spent his time pursuing his own interests like mistresses and alcohol. He never liked our family pet, a 12-year-old cat and saw my mother’s absence as an opportunity to get rid of him. He told my little sister and I that the cat was getting sick and needed to be put up for adoption at the local shelter. He promised that if the cat wasn’t adopted within a week we’d take him back. When we arrived, he asked my little sister and I to sit in another waiting area while he filed the necessary paperwork. Shortly thereafter, we were escorted into a room, where the veterinarian asked us to say our final goodbyes because my dad had just signed the paperwork to put our childhood pet to sleep. Needless to say, I felt betrayed, distraught and insecure and thought I could find solace in a substance. I met with a few friends that evening to smoke weed to try and forget my most Judas experience. I over-consumed with self destructive intent. Overly and uncomfortably stoned, I sat in the back left seat of my friend’s car, gazing into my own eyes within the rear view mirror. As I peered into my reflected self, I caught myself saying a colloquial phrase my father frequently said when making a point “…To boot”. This is the exact moment my mental illness started; I created a sense of sameness between my father and I, ultimately skewing my perception of identity and reality itself. This is the moment everything changed; a parallel of my identity was made to the person who betrayed me, while under heavy influence, caused my perception of reality to alter. In my personal opinion, this was a defense mechanism meant to protect me but instead, went awry. I felt uncomfortable, I knew something was askew, something was different, my friends assured me it was the pot and sleeping it off would fix my situation. It did not. From that point on, I’ve lived with a series of dissociative symptoms: an inability to recognize myself in a reflection or my own physicality; I’m aware that I stand in front of a mirror viewing myself, seeing my reflection, but I do not look the way I think I do. I have suicidal depression and ruminating thoughts, anxiety, an altered sense of time and long term memory loss that’s best explained as the inability to remember this morning because it feels like yesterday, whereas yesterday feels like last week and last week doesn’t exist, a sensitivity to fluorescent lights, and an emotional numbing. Life is a constant dream state in which I’m detached from reality, similar to a mushroom trip or being caught in a K-hole. By the time I graduated from high school, I had only told my parents that, “Sometimes it feels like I’m waking up from a dream in the middle of the day”. My mother showed concern as there is a history of mental illness on her family’s side. In the fall, I went to university with a group of friends, ones I’ve had through elementary and high school, telling no one. There is a social stigma with mental illness and further stigma around boys or men sharing their personal feelings and experiences. Sharing them would be a sign of weakness. I bottled my disorder in shame, because I felt as if I would be burdening my friends with my problems and issues. A lot of my first year was spent Googling symptoms I was feeling, until I came across a term ‘Depersonalization — a state in which one’s thoughts and feelings seem unreal or not to belong to oneself, or in which one loses all sense of identity.” From there, I found forums that had first person accounts about having and living with the disorder. I didn’t feel so alone. Very few people can say this, but, Matthew Perry saved my life. If it wasn’t for his work in the movie Numb, in which his character has the disorder, I wouldn’t be here today. Although, I now knew what the disorder was, I didn’t know how to fix it, so I started drinking. Heavily. Not for fun, not to socialize, but to hide — most nights, to the point of puking. I hit rock bottom late in my second year of university. At this particular time, I spent three consecutive days in bed avoiding all personal contact, ignoring any knocks on my bedroom door, dismissing all calls and texts. I lay depressed, only thinking of my roommate’s single blade razor. I was faced with David Foster Wallace’s ultimate dilemma; leap from my burning building or face the flames. I realized that suicide is a permanent solution to a temporary problem and like any problem, there has to be a solution. If the end goal is health and well-being, what’s the step before that? And what’s the step before that? How many steps to where I am now? I dropped out of university telling the majority it was for financial reasons and sought professional help. Few people knew the truth. My illness is not well understood, so I was enrolled in Canada’s Early Psychosis Intervention program and experienced a series of heavy medication (Seroquel, Abilify, Prozac, an endless list) and weekly therapy appointments. Life moves slowly on an antipsychotic. I can recall being comatose in the passenger seat on the way to an appointment, thoughts not going much further than the rain drops on the window. The next few years were spent learning to manage and come to terms with my disorder while seeing a revolving doors of psychiatrists and psychologists, determining the right dosages and prescriptions of medication. CBT, or Cognitive Behaviour Therapy, the practicing of acknowledging and overcoming thought fallacies, taught me to understand myself and how to overcome suicidal thoughts. Although I was getting healthier, I still hid my disorder. A series of excuses developed to hide the truth as I’d have to sneak away from roommates to explain why I was busy every Tuesday afternoon. I told friends I couldn’t party because I had to work in the morning when in reality, I was at the hospital getting a CT scan. Or I’d leave the bar early claiming to need sleep but instead, I was crying on a park bench trying to calm the ruminating thoughts of suicide, depression and social anxiety. A year and half ago, I decided I no longer needed the crutch of medication to walk through life, that I was strong enough to walk on my own. After consulting with my physician, I began to wean myself off 20mg of Cipralex and 150mg of Welbutrin. Withdrawing from antidepressants is a dreadful experience; hot and cold sweats, upset stomach, dizziness, zapping sensations throughout your body, nausea, nightmares, convulsing while falling asleep and random mood swings. Ironically, marijuana, the thing that catalysed my illness, was the only thing that helped me get back to my normality by curbing my withdrawal symptoms. Today, I am still experiencing this illness, but I am prescription medication free. I am no longer experiencing withdrawal, I am no longer suicidal or anxious, I am able to look at myself in the eyes again and I am happy and productive. I am certain, but hope otherwise, that this disorder will be with me for life. And even though I know this, it won’t stop me from leading a healthy, fulfilling life, full of happiness and loved ones.",2017
Depression Is So Depressing,"I’ve been wanting to write this for a while but I was scared to really delve in. I’ve written about depression before, like here and here and here, but I’ve always held something back. Depression is different for everyone. I’d like to think most people would look at me and not have any idea I suffer from depressive and anxiety disorders. Maybe I’m just kidding myself but since I’m pretty high functioning there’s a chance you’d think I’m as normal as the next person when you see me walking down the street or sitting in a particularly painful meeting while valiantly trying not to stab myself with my pen just so I can leave the meeting and go home. But depression sucks. It’s so … what’s the word? Depressing. That’s it. It sucks the life out of me. And it festers and feeds on itself and grows hungrier and more ruthless in its quest to rob me of anything that would approximate joy. Sometimes it makes me physically ill, where I have aches and pains like I’m twice my age, but most of the time it just makes me exhausted. Like trying one more time to find something happy or worthwhile or just not craptastic is so unbearably tiring that I can’t keep my eyes open. When I’m depressed, I just want to give up. There’s no will in me left to fight. Whatever energy I have left is consumed with one purpose: to berate myself for being so damn horrible in the first place. It’s like the soundtrack of my depression is my own awful voice, sounding off over and over again that this is nothing more or less than I deserve. You know how some people say they’re their own worst critic? Or that they’re self-deprecating largely to get people to say, “No way! You are wonderful and amazing!”? That’s not what I do. I live in an echo chamber of relentless self-castigation where I berate myself until I can barely stand up under the weight of my own self-disgust. It sounds amazeballs, doesn’t it? I work hard at managing my depression and anxiety. I’ve seen my therapist so frequently and for so many years that I think we’re technically common law married in several states. I do what she says even when I’m not feeling it. Like when she says to talk back to my unreasonable feelings of self-disgust and loathing, I give it a shot. When she says to take more Vitamin D or Folic Acid or exercise more, I comply. I take my medicines even when I very much want to not be medicated. I try to get enough sunlight during the winter month and try not to let myself hermit away even when it seems like the only logical course of action. And yet there are days when this soul-sucking depression brings me to my knees. And sadly, those are the days I’m least likely to tell anyone about. When my depression is at its worst that’s when I’m at my most silent. It’s not until after I’ve reached my most desperate and dangerous that I shout out a drive-by to my therapist or psychiatrist that things had been really bad. Listen, I know that makes no sense. These are the people I should be telling those things to when they’re happening. But I don’t. I’m worried about freaking them out. I don’t want them to think things are as bad as they are so I wait until they start to get a little better and that’s when I spill the beans and say how unbearably depressed I’ve been, how I’ve avoided friends and family, how I just didn’t want to try anything anymore. Maybe I’ll get that order right one day and reach out for help when I need it most but for now, I do what I do. Which involves a lot of stumbling and self-medicating and over-analysis and any number of things that would be better if they were never contemplated but it’s just how I roll. And so, I write this post; not to freak out loved ones with tales of my personal woes but in case one of you feels a little bit the same. In case one of you is thinking, “I wish I was normal like everyone else” or “I’ll just keep faking it until I make it”, you’d know that it’s okay to feel like shit. I mean, it’s not okay but it’s not abnormal. It is what it is. Stop comparing yourself to what you think you should be. Start thinking about what and how you want to be. And cut yourself some slack. Because you keep showing up day after day, even when it’s too hard, even when the road is too long, even when it seems like things will never, ever change. You put a smile on even when you don’t feel it. You try to be a good person and care about the most vulnerable and persecuted amongst us. You try to pass along some act of kindness or civility in the hopes that the arcs of fate and benevolence will make everything just a little bit easier, a little less painful. Sometimes it will. Sometimes it won’t. But it is not your fault and it’s not in your head.",2017
The Depressive Mind,"My eyes opened suddenly to find myself in my bed. I stretched out my arm erratically to find my watch. Ah! Found it! It's only 6.30 am. Too early for a sleeping beauty. Although the little voice inside me said get out of bed, the dark depressive devil was louder. The Dark devil of my mind told me you cant. Stay where you are. Stay in the cozy comfortable blankets.You are too weak to deal with the world beyond the bed. I curled up and shut my eyes once again. Hours passed by as I opened my eyes, contemplating what the dark voice said and shut them again. It is probably right. I should listen. The voluntary paralysis was a familiar beckoning. The morning’s fresh clear mind clouded with negative thoughts and emotions. Yet another familiar feeling. Not enjoyable but familiar. Happy thoughts seem alien to me. The thoughts kept going on a loop and sometimes new ones came up until I couldnt take it anymore. I tried to fight it. But failed again. 'I am a failure’ , I concluded. It was hopeless. The voice of my mother and her gentle nudging didn’t do any good. The constant gloom fought the life force within me. They were at war, the light and dark. The light was dimming. I felt dead inside. So disconnected from the world. This persistent conflict aggravated the anxiety into a panic. I was unable to think rationally. It was so odd, so confusing. Completely hopeless. To end this, ending life seemed the only way. Yes you guessed right, suicide... It happens to the best of us. Depression doesn’t care how much money you have, where you come from and even age. Quite a liberal I must say! If sadness is sliping in mud in your best dress, then Depression is like falling in quicksand. You sink, struggle and sink some more. Give love and support to your friends or family who have depression. Sometimes, that makes all the difference.",2017
Battle With My Body,"Over the past two years I have had a total of about 10 sinus infections, a few bouts of bronchitis, three strep infections, a few colds here and there, along with a tonsillectomy and countless rounds of antibiotics, a few MRI’s/CT scans, blood tests, IV’s, doctor visits, hospitalizations and a lot of tears and frustration. Needless to say I’m sick and tired of it all (quite literally sick and tired). About two years ago at this time I was about half way through my senior year of high school. With that came the stress of applying/waiting to hear back from college, as well as leaving a good impression of high school. As winter approached I became very aware of my body. And by that I mean I was aware of every ache and pain I felt, I was aware of my heartbeat at all times, and I was scared to take any kind of medication, even Advil. I dug myself into a deep anxious/depressed state. I wouldn’t fall asleep until around 2 or 3 in the morning, when I became so physically exhausted I couldn’t keep my eyes open. When I woke up in the mornings I would go right back to felling anxious and conscious of my heart beating. Nothing seemed to be able to snap me out and I developed a pounding headache that would not go away, that lasted for about a month before my parents decided it was time to take me to the hospital, I was admitted and they set me up on an IV, said I was dehydrated (even though I drink at least 7–10 glasses of water a day) they did an CT scan of my brain, and after a long day of IV’s dripping into my vein (which I was terrified of even though they only put fluids and Benadryl into me) they told me I was just anxious and that I needed to “calm down” and “relax” and “not stress too much about college applications.” Just what you want to hear right? Oh jee why didn’t I think of that sooner? I continued to get odd symptoms like hand tingling, headaches and chest pains until I started up track in the spring. I was able to get my mind off of things for a bit and focus on running until the end of the school year. By graduation I was on cloud nine, and I was feeling amazing. That’s euphoric feeling lasted until about three weeks after graduation. Around July 4th of last year (2015) was when I got my first bout of bronchitis, what I thought was a cold, never went away and turned into a horrible cough. I went to the doctor, was diagnosed with bronchitis, given some inhalers to try, and sent home. I think they ended up working initially but it never fully went away and through out the summer the cough kept coming back. When the inhalers didn’t work, doctors eventually diagnosed me with chronic sinus infections. I was given some different antibiotics combined with steroids to help combat the sinus infections. They would clear up for a few weeks and then I would go hang out with friends late one night or not sleep well and the next morning I would wake up with a sore throat which would turn into a cough and eventually a sinus infection. Every time. This would happen about once or twice every month from July until February of 2016. I got a CT scan of my sinuses to see what was going and there was evidence of mucus build up in my sinuses but nothing too out of the ordinary. I got sick a few times that spring but things seemed to calm down, until the summer. Last summer came around and again right around July 4th I got my first (of three) strep infections. I went to the doctor and tested positive for strep, was given antibiotics and was sent home. I got better and felt pretty good for about a week and the same thing happened, I got strep again, and again. After the third time we started talking to doctors about removing my tonsils. The first doctor we visited advised strongly against that idea, saying the recovery would be horrible, the surgery wouldn’t do much for me and I wouldn’t find a doctor willing to take them out. Leaving very frustrated and upset we went to another doctor and before I could even suggest a tonsillectomy he was asking me how soon I wanted to get them out. I told him “now if possible please!!” Now I did have to wait about three weeks to get them out, but I managed and surgery day came around. I was so nervous, mostly for the though of being placed on an IV, but they gave me some anti anxiety medicine and I was good to go. The recovery from tonsillectomy was brutal, I lost 15 lbs in about two weeks, I didn’t leave the house for about the same amount of time. I could barely get up and walk to the kitchen and became so weak. I didn’t react well to the antibiotics to the after effects of the anesthesia. I finally started to feel like myself about two and a half weeks after the surgery and could eat regular food again. Since the surgery I have had a few sinus infections still, but their degree has been much lower compared to pre-tonsillectomy. Through all of this I was living with a lot of fear and frustration. Fear for when I would get sick next and frustration because other than chronic sinus infections, I was healthy. I ran a half marathon in November of 2015 (my third one), I was eating healthy and napping almost everyday. When I mention to people that I’m sick they just tell me to take some vit C and get some rest, what they don’t know is that I already take almost all of the preventative measure for getting sick. Because I’ve been sick so much I’ve had to just continue with my life when I get sick, because you can only take so many days off from normal life. When this happens, I feel absolutely exhausted. These are usually “minimal days” in which I just get done what absolutely needs to be accomplished, and then I usually retreat to my room to rest and stay away from the germs of the outside. I feel like I’m fighting a battle against my body, and for once id like to be at peace with it. I keep telling my self that one day I will become “one” with my body, that if I treat it with respect, it will in turn do the same for me. I am still trying to understand why there are so many things preventing me from being one with my body, but for now I’m just keeping up with all of my preventative routines so I know that I’m doing everything in my control to not get sick. And if at the end of the day I’m still coughing or sneezing, I just have to deal with it. I didn’t really have a purpose to writing this article, however I did want to document the last couple of years and maybe see if anyone is going though anything similar to my story. I am still functioning, I just have my slow days, and while I do feel discouraged a lot of the time, I’m still moving forward. I’m not going to give up just cause some bacteria want to live in my sinuses. And I will not stop trying to find ways to improve my health and improve the things I have control over in regards to my health. I’m also trying to find better ways to manage all of my anxiety that comes with being sick and my general anxiety. Its all a work in progress and I can say for certain that I am a healthier, better educated, more conscious person than I was two years ago, but I am still a work in progress and everything takes time. That’s all for now :)",2017
Making The Transition From Work To Home Less Awkward,"The most awkward part of the day is between 5:00PM and 7:00PM. Coming home from work is supposed to be a good feeling. Finally, you can kick up your feet, relax, and enjoy your well-earned evening. Or, if you’re like me, you awkwardly stalk around your house looking for a distraction to dissipate the lingering anxious energy left over from work. You know, the kind of anxious energy that prevents you from truly relaxing, but also drains you to the point where you don’t feel like doing anything. I call it the post-work void — the weird intermission in your day where you’re physically home, but the mentality hasn’t quite caught up yet. You know what’s a scary word? Sedentary. Everyday, studies are coming out saying just how awful it is so have sedentary jobs. Contrast that with the fact that sedentary jobs have increased by 83% since 1950 and the conclusion is obvious. We’re doomed. We are becoming those people from Wall-E and there’s nothing we can do about it. The word sedentary tends to echo through my brain when I get home from work. It’s a dialogue between me and brain that goes sort of like this: Me: Man, that was a hard day at work, I’m so glad that’s over. Brain: But you were sedentary!!! You need to do something — quick! Me: But I’m super tired and my brain feels fried. Brain: Okay, then just walk around the house and pretend that you’re happy that you’re home. Me: Okay, fine. Now don’t even get my started on the screens aspect to all this. Oh, what’s that, CNN? Americans are spending more than 10 hours a day starring at screens? And, what’s that you say, Bustle? I’m more likely to die earlier due to excess screen time? Great. So, after a full day of work starring at a computer screen, this about sums up my self-perception at the end of the day: Please don’t get me wrong. I love screens. I love watching sports, playing video games, and enjoying movies and television. Except, my post-work brain won’t allow me to enjoy those wonderful pass-times after work because of the connotations depicted above. In other words, I desperately want to relax, but what I do to relax isn’t emotionally comfortable in the post-work void. So, what do we do? We work way too hard to waste a single instant of post-work freedom. As you can tell from my introductory ramblings, I certainly don’t have all the answers. But I’m willing to try some new things. And if you’re reading this, than you probably are too. I’ve done the research for you, (and apparently lost like two weeks of my life thanks to the screen time. You’re welcome.) and these are a few ideas that we can implement as soon as today after work. I’m not talking about any sort of intense exercise commitment here, I’m talking about just going out your front door, and walking around. There’s something undeniably magical about being outside compared to spending your whole day indoors. Walking around outside, as opposed to pacing around your house, gives you a fresher perspective, and lets your tired eyes adjust to the natural world around you. If your ears aren’t already sore from wearing headphones all day, listen to a podcast talking about something you love. Or, leave your phone at home, and just let the outside world wash over you. When you feel like your mind has transitioned to a comfortable, post-work state of mind, head home and start enjoying those sedentary, screen-related hobbies with significantly less guilt! Or not, but that’s probably what I would do. Note: Having a dog would make this mandatory! And therefore easier. I wish I had a dog. 2. Cook Your Dinner I’m sure I’m preaching to the choir on this, but sometimes the last thing you want to do when you get home is stand in the kitchen and cook. Especially when you consider how tasty a #4 Combo at your local burger joint sounds. But cooking is one of those things where once you start doing it, you’ll secretly start enjoying it. You’re on your feet, your making something with your hands, and as far as I’m concerned, if it’s made at home, it’s at least sort of healthy (baby steps). When you finish cooking, you’ll feel much better about eating your meal while enjoying dinner show, or talking about your day with family or roommates. It’s science. 3. Hobby Okay, I know that hobbies are sometimes more anxiety-inducing than they are anxiety-relieving, but let’s talk about it anyways. Getting through the post-work void is all about accessible, replicable activities. It’s not like we can go sky diving after work everyday to feel refreshed and reinvigorated. But you can dust off the old guitar in the corner you’ve been meaning to practice, or break out the coloring book you got for Christmas and haven’t touched since, or shoot some baskets at the local park. These kinds of activities will engage the non-work parts of your brain, and bring you to a comfortable state of mind to enjoy your evening. Note: Make sure you don’t stress out about having the coolest hobbies in the world. Just find something that you like that is easy to do, and doesn’t remind you of what you do at work. 4. Yoga & Meditation Exercises Yeah, I said it. In my research for the cure of the post-work void, I came across some interesting self-care content that seems to appear every February. Usually I ignore yoga-associated relaxation suggestions, but I said I would be willing to try new things, and I’m going to back that up. I came across one blog post that caught my eye about quick, self-care meditation practices that can elevate your state of mind. In other words, elevate you from the effects of the post-work void. If you’re telling me that in 15 or less minutes I can shake the shackles of work and start enjoying my evening sooner than later, than I figure it’s worth a try. There’s a lyric from a new band called Dams of the West, that says, “I need to reassure myself that I’m more than just my Saturdays.” Friends, we are more than just our Saturdays, we just need to start acting like it. Good luck to us all in conquering the post-work void and actually start enjoying our weekday evenings as much as possible.",2017
‘till Thursday,"There is this young man, friendly, reserved yet open, who has already gone through a lot of hardship. The past has left it marks in his mind and on his body. He has learned to control himself, he knows whats inside him and he just wants to be helped, wants that his feelings stay on a normal level and do not overwhelm him. He knows that he can’t do this on his own, that he needs help. We meet on a Saturday and he has one goal in mind: reaching Thursday morning. On Thursday his treatment begins and he wants to make it without a fall-back and beeing hospitalised, because that would delay his treatment to an uncertain date. His mum is very sick and the situation is tense. But there is this Thursday he is hoping for. If he reaches it, he feels that then the rest will be doable, not easy, but doable. He was sent to our church and on the basic level he finds community and feels that he is not so alone anymore. Now we are in this together! He also sees the possibility that God plays a part in all that and is embarking on the journey of faith! Thursday comes and treatment starts… It doesn’t mean that everything is easy now, but there is hope! That is the part everyone of us can play: share live and journey with someone who needs help. You don’t have to be a doctor or therapist, just an human being with empathy. Show them that you care and be reliable. Accompany them, at least ‘till Thursday!",2017
#TimeToTalk — #BreakTheSilence on mental health | Good Enough Diary on WordPress.com,"It’s Thursday morning and anxiety is being a bit of a bitch. I slept badly — too cold, rough dreams — and struggle to make myself do things. I talk myself through it — through shower, nice breakfast, a bit of calming exercise — but I still fail at time management. I’m late. A bit mad with myself. Make that very mad. I don’t know what to do. I’m late to a very nice theatre workshop that I attended last week too. It’s made for and by refugees and free (donations for food) and it makes me feel conflicted. Those familiar with my situation know that I’m not earning much and haven’t been for a while. It might change soon (fingers crossed), but doing anything nice that isn’t a gig (or otherwise directly career-related) makes me feel guilty. Nevermind that if I want to help refugees, here is the thing I can do — donate time, attention, workshop-leading skills and some English language conversation. So on top of all these feelings now I have being late, which is a particular emotional bruise — I’d say trigger, but who knows what could crawl out of the depths of the Internet to accuse me of being a snowflake? — and so, I struggle. To go or not to go. After provoking an argument with one of my nearest and dearest (argument that didn’t need to happen, only I was so mad) I sit down with myself and hash out a solution. I’ll go to the very end of the event. Then I’ll have shown up but I’ll sidestep being late AND still leave the house. The mental labyrinth required here is still better than curling up with my phone, reading about politics for the rest of the day. I curled up for about an hour an a half, but it’s still a win. This blog, Good Enough Diary, is a bit of an homage to writer’s block — after all, suffering writer needing something to kick-start creativity is a figure we’re all familiar with. It’s harder to admit that I likely suffer from some species of anxiety mixed with previously diagnosed moodiness and depression. When I’m low, going out of the house is hard — but being around people tends to make me feel better. Conversation, speaking out, expressing — those things make me feel better. And yet it’s so hard to say this, what I’m saying now. It is so very hard. Yes, I have suffered from depression, but I don’t like even saying that. So many people have worse problems, worse bouts. I’m not self-harming, my self-neglect tendencies are presently manageable (mostly I tend to go the other way, making healthy food and such) and people with “real” problems would laugh me out of the door. I’m currently on a no sugar diet (health-related), but if I’m not — an argument with my partner could be a box of cookies, or binge watching a show. I enjoy both of those things, but they can be abused as well. Externalising emotion, guilt, blame — and on top I’d rather say that I’m fine. English culture is not helping here — does anyone ever expect an honest answer to a “How are you?”. I don’t like to complain and when I’m sad, being candid feels like laying my problems at someone’s feet. There, I’ve said it. Not all. People who know me as a chatterbox could likely be shocked by the presence of hidden depths. I talk a lot, but there are things held back, too. Things I’m scared to talk about, or reluctant. Ashamed. Like when I’m late or cancel, caught up in my brain, I often make a story up because I can’t bear to admit I’m feeling too low to struggle through the door. Or how I numb feeling by reading too much. Or eating, or watching. You throw stuff at feelings you don’t know how to deal with. I’m not alone in this strategy but it feels like I am, sometimes. I’m reading a number of wonderful books (Brene Brown is a particular favourite) that make me realise that my problems are legitimate and I’m adding to them by my silence. By self-shaming. Well, I’m talking now. My problems are real, but their weight wouldn’t be so heavy if I wasn’t ashamed, if I didn’t feel alone, if I wasn’t scared that they make me unlovable. And I am a person with a significant support network. So if you’re reading this, please know that I love you and am grateful for you, just my brain was not socialised to treat me well. So now it’s time to apologise for the missed workshop. And later a friend will WhatsApp from Italy — she’s somebody with whom I can talk about all this. And it’s important, people — because you need to hear the right message again and again if it’s to stay in your brain, especially if your default setting is the opposite. If you’re set up for shame, guilt, invalidating your own emotion — if you can’t deal with sadness or anger or disappointment other than burying it under sugar or alcohol or Facebook — there can never be too many times to hear that you’re alright, you’re valued, you’re allowed to speak out. Beautiful people, love yourselves. Learn to, slowly. Patiently. Time to talk. Time to talk. Time to talk. Originally published at goodenoughdiary.wordpress.com on February 2, 2017.",2017
Skin Deep,"Just as a disclaimer, I would like to acknowledge the fact that this post may come off as disguising to some of you. If you are too squeamish, I understand, but I’d like to discuss a rather unusual, and gross, habit that can sometimes be associated with mental illnesses; dermatillomania. Derma hoomie what now?! I know, the name sounds incredibly off putting, and rightly so. But what exactly is dermatillomania? The word itself translates roughly to mean skin (derma) picking (tillo) and mania, which roughly translates to “with intense uncontrollable desire” in this context. Basically, dermatillomania means obsessive skin picking. (gross, I know.) This obsessive skin picking falls under a category of BFRB, or body focused repetitive behaviors. Other things under this category include nail biting, hair pulling, (trichotillomania) and biting the inner lip/cheek. This is usually found in people who already have another type of anxiety disorder, like GAD (Generalized Anxiety Disorder) or OCD. Dermatillomania is different from someone who might scratch at an occasional itchy scab, or pick a large unsightly pimple. The difference is, for someone with dermatillomania, the skin picking becomes so intense that the person may start bleeding, often leaving welts, bruises, and scarring to the affected skin. While this is something that very few people have ever heard of, Dematillomania is actually fairly common. Statistics say that 1 in every ten or fifteen people have this disorder. The thing that makes this number up for debate is that very few of these people actually seek treatment, because the disorder comes across as disgusting, and persons afflicted often harbor feelings of shame associated with the picking. I personally have struggled with skin picking in various forms for most of my life, but only recently decided to seek treatment. I had recently been diagnosed with bipolar disorder, and was already enduring intensive treatment and counseling, so because I already had my guard down, and had gotten to know and trust my therapist, I finally decided to mention it to him. I was embarrassed at first, because this is something that is rather unhygienic, and tended to make me feel inferior, and even, at times, ugly. The scars on my face, (from picking at acne) chest, and back made me feel like a sub human, because any “normal” person ought to be able to control those unconscious urges. My therapist introduced me to the term Dermatillomania, and the relief I found was overwhelming. Not only was I not the only person to go through something like this, but it had a name! I remember crying in his office, overwhelmed at learning that this thing with which I had been suffering with for so long was actually a real condition caused by my anxiety disorder, and not just some weird personality flaw or attempt to self depreciate. For the first time, I realized that this problem, which I always assumed to be a shortcoming in my own character that I needed to take control of, might actually no be my fault. It’s been a few months since I started seeking treatment, and while I am working on erasing feelings of shame associated with the skin picking, the scars are still there. They stare me down in the mirror every morning. Sometimes it is hard to look at myself, the scabs, the healing wounds that mark my face, neck and chest. Sometimes I feel disgusting. I am working on being easier on myself, and am constantly reminding myself that I am doing what I can, and seeking treatment. The problem with treatment is that because most of the people who are afflicted with dermatillomania feel so much guilt and shame about the condition, not many go to medical professionals for help, and thus not much is known about how the disorder works. The exception to this rule is when the sites of the picking become infected, which can happen. By that point, the damage is irreversible. While there is no real “miracle cure” to the disorder, it is being studied in other animals, domestic cats and dogs for example, who show similar patterns. Cats and dogs will lick or bite at themselves when put in situations of high stress. Some species of birds pluck out their own feathers. This is something that isn’t unique only to humans. The biggest reason I bring all of this up is to point out that there is help out there. It isn’t full-proof, but in working with my therapist I have been able to start identifying the things that most often trigger me to want to start picking. My face has slowly begun to start healing, although I have had some relapses lately. I’m making this post mostly to raise awareness, and to let those of you who may have, or may know someone who has been afflicted with this disorder know that you are not alone. By increasing awareness to this fairly common problem, I’m hoping to find a source of community, and acceptance among people like myself, and to dissipate the stigma that forces people to suffer in silence.",2017
Through the Writer’s Eyes: An Evening with Ruth Whippman,"By Jennifer Dwight What happens when a British documentary filmmaker and investigative journalist with a wicked sense of humor uproots herself to California when her husband takes a job at a Silicon Valley start-up? She explores her new environs, of course, and is confronted with its lexicon. Culture shock hits hard, and the same topic keeps rearing its ugly head in her efforts to make friends and belong to her community. She hears a lot of talk about happiness in a sea of anxiety. And so began the quest of Ruth Whippman to come to grips with a conundrum and to ferret out its causes and effects. Here in the Land of Plenty, people are not happy. We lead the world in clinical anxiety and, according to a study of the developed countries reported by the World Health Organization, the U.S. ranks two slots behind Rwanda for happiness…a jolting statistic, to say the least. Why? How do we know this? How are the data gathered and analyzed? Who funds the studies? Is the search for happiness causing unhappiness? One thing is indisputable: the evaluation of whether one is happy, or on the road to becoming happy, has now bled into the language of the work place, parenting, academia, science, religion, journalism, and is itself an industry. I had the good fortune of hearing Ms. Whippman speak about her investigations into America’s $11 billion happiness industry one evening at Books Inc. in Berkeley, as we celebrated the release of her rich, fact-filled new book. It is America the Anxious: How Our Pursuit of Happiness Is Creating a Nation of Nervous Wrecks (St. Martin’s Press/Macmillan, Oct. 4, 2016), a splendid, funny, and thought-provoking work which was named one of the 40 best books of 2016 by The New York Post, a New York Times Editor’s Choice selection, one of Newsweek’s Nine Books to Change the Way You Think in 2016, and one of Bustle’s best non-fiction books of October 2016. Research took Ms. Whippman to many different venues in several states. She attended quasi-spiritual self-help seminars. She met with scientists at U.C. Berkeley at the Greater Good Science Center, which promotes “The Science of a Meaningful Life” — see http://greatergood.berkeley.edu- and gathers happiness data from test subjects. She went to Zappos corporate headquarters, as well as a Utopian planned community. She explored the positive psychology movement, and its insistent message that we are responsible for our own happiness, that circumstances don’t matter because it’s all about attitude. If one has a more positive attitude, one need not focus on one’s problems, even those of grinding poverty. She also made striking discoveries about the sources of funding for many studies and seminars promoting the positive psychology movement — captains of industry who benefit from a workforce constrained to lower earnings, whose despair must be managed for the financial gain of others. Newsflash: when the financiers are invested in the outcome of the studies, there is a very real problem with conflict of interest. Ms. Whippman stayed with a Mormon family in Utah to explore why Mormons are consistently ranked as among the happiest people in American at the same time that “Mormon Utah also has the highest rate of antidepressant use in the United States, with records released by prescription drug companies showing that the rate of prescriptions for depression medication in Utah is around twice the national average.”[i] Women may be the problem, it seems. They just can’t seem to stay as cheerful on the inside as they must appear on the outside. So where did the quest lead? To the conclusion that we need to spend less time searching for meaning, less time at work, and more time living our lives. People need a sense of community. People need time to develop relationships, more time for rest, and a social safety net. It turns out that quality of life need not be complicated, or engineered, or “managed” — just allowed, in an environment of respect where the basics of life (affordable food, housing, medical care, education, and work) are available to more than the privileged.

It is #timetotalk about shame,"Shame encourages me to spend far too much time apologising for the choices I make in my life, even though I really don’t need to be sorry for them. Shame sits on my shoulder asking me what would so-and-so think about this? And what about that? Shame asks me to justify my actions and decisions against the expectations of others, regardless of whether those expectations fit with my life. Shame really likes to put me under a ton of pressure. Shame makes me doubt myself. Shame is constantly trying to remind me that I am not okay. That I need to be better. That I need to make sure that everyone knows that I am fully aware I need to be better. Shame doesn’t cooperate with my efforts to look after my mental health. In fact shame is always looking for ways to sabotage it. Shame tells me that it’s probably best to keep quiet. Not to rock the boat. It suggests that however bad I’m feeling, talking about it would only make it worse. For a long time I let shame get away with all of this. After all I believe that shame does all this while thinking that it has my best interests at heart. I don’t believe shame is deliberately trying to make me feel crap. I believe that shame thinks it is trying to help me make my life better. It is just doing a really really awful job of it. Shame is great at giving really bad opinions and advice. As well meaning as shame might be, for the sake of my mental health, I have to stand up to it. I have to be strong. I have to let it know that it is not welcome. But I don’t have to do it alone. This time last year shame was having a riot in my head. I was a fairly new mum. And a new mum who was having a really tough time with breastfeeding. Shame was loving it. Shame kept reminding me how important breastfeeding was. That it was more important than anything else in the whole world. It was the most important measure of whether I was a good mum or not. And as my baby was failing to gain weight fast enough, quite clearly I was a crap mum. But giving up was not an option. Because then I would be a total failure. Any sense of perspective I might have had about the situation in normal circumstances had been swallowed into a big black hole of shame. On occasion I’d think that maybe the best thing was to stop. But as soon as I thought about having that conversation with anyone else, shame would tell me that I would feel a much bigger failure if I openly admitted defeat. That I should just keep quiet and struggle on. Until my sister stepped in, and told me to stop. For my own mental health. And for my baby too. And when I decided to stop I started talking. But it wasn’t easy. It was bloody scary. I was convinced that people would question my decision. That they would tell me I was wrong. That they would urge me to keep going. I was exhausted. I didn’t have the energy to deal with that. I desperately wanted to keep quiet. But somehow I found the courage to talk. The courage to tell the people closest to me about my decision. And their response was filled with love. They made it better. They told me how amazing I was for keeping breastfeeding so long when it had been so tough. They told me that they completely understood my decision. That it was totally okay. They reminded me that although my baby girl wasn’t gaining weight as fast as she “should” be, she was gaining weight. She was growing because of me. She was happy and healthy because of me. They reassured me that I was making the right choice for us, and they made me feel completely and utterly supported in it. And what I didn’t realise until a long while later was that in the moments I was talking, shame was retreating. Shame was gradually getting pushed out of the picture. The more I talked, the less of a grip shame had on me. Shame did a very good job of keeping me quiet. I am so grateful to those who stopped it from silencing me completely. If we can share our story with someone who responds with empathy and understanding, shame can’t survive. Brené Brown We all know there are a bzillion things we could be doing “better” in our lives. But it’s totally okay if not doing them is the best thing for us right now. It is okay to have other priorities. To make other choices. We can keep shame at bay by knowing it is okay to be who we are. And to be where we are right now, even if that isn’t where we hoped we’d be. We can tell shame to sod off by trusting ourselves to know our own priorities. Refusing to let it make us feel like we need to explain or defend our choices. We can be unapologetic in our decisions, even when we choose to take the easy option in one area of our lives, because something else is much more important. We can refuse to let shame through the door when we trust that we are doing our best. It is totally okay for everyone to have different priorities, make different choices and do things in different ways. We don’t ever see the full picture of anyone else’s life, and they don’t see the full picture of ours. We can know we are doing the best with what we have right now. And we can always make shame vanish into thin air when we talk. This #timetotalk day I pledge that I will find the courage to talk when I realise that shame has sneaked in the back door and started to make itself at home. Shame can make itself seem big and scary, but I know all it takes is a hint of love and a nice big hug to send it running in the opposite direction. I hope you find the courage and #timetotalk too x This post is part of Time to Talk Day 2017. “Conversations change lives.

Productivity Life Hacks from My Anxiety,"So you’ve bitten off more than you can chew again, huh? Well, that’s just typical for an underdog like you, who must constantly fight for recognition and acceptance in a world where nothing will be handed to you. Since everyone is secretly plotting against you, you will have to work harder, longer, and smarter than your enemies. You think your schedule is completely full? THINK AGAIN. Just because you’re booked from the time you wake up to the time you fall asleep doesn’t mean there isn’t time for you to take on another project so that your manager doesn’t perceive you as slacking and give you a poor performance review and then you get fired and then you run out of money and have to live under the Foster bridge. Here’s four ways to get EVEN MORE DONE, brought to you by my ceaseless and vital anxiety.",2017
How to silence anxiety,"We often resort to metaphors or analogies to explain what anxiety feels like. “It feels like being strapped in a chair but looking at a wide open door.” “It’s like that feeling when you miss a step, but the feeling doesn’t end.” or “You’re swimming and swimming and swimming, getting more and more tired, but there’s no land in sight.” If you’ve ever suffered from it I’m sure you have you’re own analogy to explain the feeling. For a while now I’ve been setting my intention on trying to silence the noise. To turn my anxiety into an acquaintance rather than an enemy I’m in constant conflict with. I wanted to be in control again. Here are 5 things I’ve found that help: Anxiety can often feel like you’ve forgotten how to breathe. It’s the simplest of tasks and then suddenly it becomes the biggest challenge. Every so often take a few moments to pause, and take a conscious breath. Do this often until it doesn’t seem strange anymore, put reminders in your phone, or little notes all over the house. You’ll be surprised how much it helps. By being aware of your breath you are instantly bought back to the present moment. The only moment you really have. So much of anxiety is caused by the unknown future or the rumination of past events, that by simply just being aware of your breathing it can help you refocus. As well as breathing exercises try bringing your attention to your hands, or your feet it will also bring you back to the present. Back to yourself. Social media can be powerful, so powerful that we really don’t fully understand the affects of it yet. We’ve seen how social media can be used for good and for bad. But what is most powerful is how subconsciously it’s shaping how we think. We’re constantly exposed to pictures of what life ‘should’ be like, where we ‘should’ be by age 25, or what we ‘should’ look like. This feeds into dangerous habits of comparison and not being appreciative of what we do have. We constantly dismiss the present for a perfect fantasy. If you find yourself feeling drained after a social media scroll, it’s time to call a hiatus. Take a break. A break from ‘perfection’. Enjoy the taste of your meal rather than the look, enjoy the conversation with the company you keep rather than perfect selfie. Once you cut all that out your left with enough energy and focus to enjoy the moment. Remember all those bed time routines you would huff and puff over as a child, turns out they’re extremely important. There is nothing that can make you feel as good as a full nights sleep. When I’m suffering from anxiety pretty bad, I will wake up at 4am routinely. I won’t be able to sleep properly after that, and I definitely will find it harder to be aware of my thoughts. At least an hour before bed put away your phone, pick up a book or journal instead. Start a routine and try to get as many zzz’s as you can. Trust me, there is no substitute. When I’m worried about something, no matter how big or small it may seem, I practice zooming out. For example, if something has happened at work which I’ve been unable to shake off, I ask myself will this matter in 3x months? 9x months? 18 months? 5 years? I zoom further and further out until the picture becomes clearer. I’ve learnt that you can’t stop thoughts, the moment you think you can stop them, that then becomes your focus and they’re heightened. What you can do is become aware of them. The moment you become aware and watch them, you realise that they will come and go. Think of thoughts as guests, some are welcomed and some can be uninvited and unwanted. But the thing about guests is that they’ll leave. The thoughts will pass as does everything else. When you watch your thoughts you learn how to not get attached and that is how you begin to quiet the noise. What are some of your techniques of dealing with anxiety?",2017
It’s Definitely Time To Talk…,"So today (Thursday 2nd February 2017), not only means that you get a bonus post from me. It’s also Time to Talk Day (get hashtagging #TimetoTalk). The brilliant Time to Change initiative, led by Mind and Rethink Mental Illness, aims to get rid of that darn stigma attached to mental illness. About time too. It’s only now in 2017 that the government has publicly spoken about making improvements in the workplace and within schools. Quite frankly, I’ll believe it when I see it, but it’s better than nothing I suppose. Baby steps and all… Do you know what I think the government should do? We should have mental health GP’s just as we do GP’s for everything else. Maybe not on the same scale, but if we had access to a dedicated mental health professional in a GP surgery for every patient, just like an ordinary GP, and we could go to see these mental health professionals, just like we do for anything physical, maybe the stigma around mental health and talking about it might not be so bad. According to Time to Change, 90% of people with mental health problems experience some stigma from others and 60% of people with a mental health problem waited over a year until they spoke to anybody about it. Jack from Jacksgap produced a wonderful video talking about stigma. Take a few minutes to listen to his wisdom… So are you getting the message yet? Talk goddammit! It’s hard. I have suffered from anxiety in the past, and part of why I don’t really suffer from it anymore is from talking about it. Not in a town cryer way, hell no, but in the way that was best for me. Bottling up everything inside was not doing me any favours. My anxiety turned into panic attacks and my thoughts often spiralled out of control. But like many others, I felt a shame to be feeling the way I was feeling. I’m British. I’m supposed to have that stiff upper lip. I don’t want to burden anybody. I might be judged. I am supposed to be strong. Who was I kidding? At one point, I started to suffer from panic attacks continuously for six weeks. It was bloody awful. It made me realise that I had to do something about it. That’s when I bit the bullet and started counselling. For six weeks, I had an opportunity to speak to a trained professional about me. Just me. There wasn’t any agenda. There wasn’t any judgement. My therapist Michelle was absolutely wonderful and together, through her support and my commitment to doing the work outside of the sessions, I got to put a lot of things to bed, answer a lot of my questions and move forward panic attack free!! But counselling isn’t for everybody. And you have to find the right therapist for you. And it costs money if you don’t want to be put on the super long NHS waiting list. Ways To Reach Out For Friends And Family Supporting Loved Ones Cheesy but true… If somebody close to you chooses to open up to you, they will most likely have taken some time to find the courage. Listen to them, don’t offer any solution. Just let them talk. Don’t impose your opinions on them and most importantly do not say… CHEER UP STOP WORRYING or anything else in that vane. It’s might sound like you are suggesting that they hadn’t thought about that. It might also put them off opening up to anybody else. Today might be Time To Talk day, but let’s keep the conversation going everyday. Interested in posts related to mental health and wellbeing?

Stress — Using Energy Poorly!,"As long as I’ve been in business stress has been a topic of discussion. We all have experienced it at one time or the other. Some of us deal with it appropriately by realizing the detrimental effects it has on our physical, mental, and emotional being and take corrective action. Others tend to not deal with it at all, which results in experiencing the affects in body, mind and emotion. Whether you experience the results or not, the real issue is not that we have it, but how we deal with it. Energy Performance Tip:A dear friend of mine emailed me this example given by a person who was explaining stress to her group. He held up a glass of water and asked the group how heavy it was. The responses ranged from 20 to 100 grams. Then he suggested that the weight didn’t really matter. What does matter is how long you hold up the glass of water. If you hold it for a few seconds it’s really not a problem. Hold it for an hour and you get an ache in your arm. But if you hold it all day you have a real problem. The speaker continued by saying that in each case the weight is the same, but the longer you hold it the heavier it becomes. How long do you hold the issues or the people that bug you? Keep them for a few minutes and you’re okay, but if you keep them for days, look out! The trick is to put them down as soon as possible. The longer you hold the burdens the more energy you use worthlessly. In Bill Crawford’s book All Stressed Up and Nowhere to Go he states that, “Stress is a signal that something needs to change…suffering is when we don’t make the change.” I would add to this that, “Stress is the poor utilization of personal energy on things that ultimately will cause us suffering.” What you give energy to is reinforced in your life. Energy is not concerned with whether the issue is positive or negative. “Problems cannot be solved at the same level of awareness that created them.”  — Albert Einstein “The time to relax is when you don’t have time for it.” — Sydney J. Harris Energy Development Tips:Here are a few Energy Tips to help you deal with your stress. • Separate problems from conflicts — We all experience problems. Conflicts occur when someone has to be right and the other person has to be wrong. Stay away from “right” and “wrong.” View information for what it is and leave off the judgment.• Stay away from those who drain your energy — Some people make it a habit to take more energy than they give — Hang around them as little as possible. I like the wisdom of a little four year old giving advice to his friend — “Stay away from prunes.” Some people are like prunes, they may look sweet but consequences are terrible.• When all else fails — repose! — When you can do nothing, do nothing — all answers come in time.• Be selective about who and what gets your energy — If you try to give energy to everyone and everything you will end up with an empty tank. Pick and choose where your energy goes. “One of the symptoms of an approaching nervous breakdown is the belief that one’s work is terrible important.” — Bertrand Russell “Half of our life is spent trying to find something to do with time we have rushed through life trying to save.” — Will Rogers Contact Dr. Bob for a free 15-minute consultation: drbob@energydrivenleader.com I have a new e-course, Energy To Overcome Anxiety , Are you feeling tired, drained or simply worn out?

24/7,"It is exhausting being a trauma survivor. Not a day goes by when some aspect of my life isn’t impacted by the symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Today’s a great example. It’s a Thursday, and I work a 40 hour, 9–5 week. I was scheduled to have two conference calls today and had to postpone one because of my inability to stop crying. I have two deliverables due tomorrow, and they can’t be put off until Monday despite the fact that that my writing skills are diminished because my attention is elsewhere. Why is that? Because. I had an experience this morning that touched off memories of the terror of my childhood, and now my heart is aching as it tries to process what my mind synthesized today. Being a trauma survivor is like having 2 (or more) jobs. There’s the day job you do to put a roof over your head and then there’s the job you do 24/7, of processing and integrating and healing. And it’s never a linear process. For every three feet forward, you’re lucky if you go back only two feet. I have to find the time and energy to heal, yet there is no spare time or energy in any other area of my life. I have to double up my efforts and juggle both today. By tonight I’ll be totally exhausted — as if I’d run a half-marathon — from trying to manage to get everything done for work tomorrow while simultaneously actively processing terrifying memories. (As I’ve learned the hard way, that work cannot be postponed.) It’s utterly exhausting, and I’m really quite tired. I wish I (and so many others) could just get a break for once.

My understanding of Depression,"There are times when a person cannot feel safe and secure. One event can totally change your attitude towards things that used to bring you joy and happiness. Your personal nightmare enters reality, and you feel nothing better but giving up to it. Fighting, is also not an option. You probably want ask me why? Some people fight until the end to change their situations. I am one of them, really. I try so hard to avoid problems and trouble, but all of a sudden I realise that there is nothing I can do or say. There is always an obsticle that stops you from finish line. You are a prisoner of your own mind.You are stuck in a situation, that cnnot be solved in day, in a week, or a month. Some of us probably have been through this kind of feeling. The problem is that everyone see it and describe it in different ways. Mine is quite strange and dim, because I can only remember few segments of what I have been through. I wish I could not remember about it at all. However, some person once said:“ the better way of forgetting something is remembering about it”. Have no idea whether it is a 100% truth, but,still, I think it is worth trying… My whole 2016 year seems to be like this to me right now. Eternal fight between winning and losing. Rising high and falling down. It happens all the time, but last year has probably changed me very strong. Now, I do not see everything the way it used to be. Not any more….I have been through the time which can only be compared to snowball. You know, when you start rolling it becomes bigger and bigger. When everything seems so distant and unreal. Everything that surrounds you all of a sudden turns into decoration where the plot and actions become more predictable than ever. People become an automatized mob, following different directions but doing it identical way. Day which turns into a night, clock that ticks on the wall- everything starts making less sense. It is just a process, which does not change at all. I stand at my imaginary edge of a cliff and fear to make a step forward, but making a step back does not make any sence either. All those things, that you used to be scared of, are starting to get more sense. Fear and anger, insomnia and paranoia, all this starts to appear: in my head, but not in a real life. Emotions happen only within me. Expressing them is a great task to do, but I am unable to show them, because I do not feel purpose for that. There is no point in it, at all. Or I imagine that I sit at the middle of a dark empty space, with knees pressed against my chest. I can also lie on the bed and look at the ceiling, thinking of absolutely nothing. And while I lie on the bed, sofa, or floor, it does not really matter…I feel safe, calmed and peaceful. I do not have to rush, go, or put effort. This is a safe place. Unfortunately, this place has a name: depression. I do not understand when it exactly starts, or when it ends, but sometimes I can still feel its presence. Depression has no difference of whome to choose. It attacks you and absorbs you with everything you have. I cannot give any advice of how to overcome it, or how to fight against it. There is no defined cure to how you can solve the problem. I am just a surviver and very happy for that.",2017
Use This Mind-Body Practice to Help You Fall Asleep,"For quality, consistent sleep every night, it’s critical to develop a healthy bedtime routine, as well as lifestyle factors such as proper nutrition and physical activity — all of which affect our sleep patterns. That said, there are some nights where anxiety just gets the better of us despite all of our best efforts. So, the next time you find yourself tossing and turning, and in ‘mind overdrive’ (incessant worrying, ruminating and thinking about such things as work and to-do lists), try the following technique. I like to call this practice The Smiling, Sleepy Buddha. It’s one of my favorite methods (and it’s often a favorite of my clients!) to peacefully fall asleep or fall back to sleep if you’ve woken up in the middle of the night with anxious thoughts. It incorporates mindfulness, a breath technique, body temperature regulation, and a tiny smile! The Smiling, Sleepy Buddha: A practice to help you fall asleep Step 1: Position Roll over onto your back (so you can effectively take long, deep full breaths) into Savasana (Corpse pose). Step 2: Smile Add an ever so slight and comfortable smile to your face. Use just enough pressure to gently engage the muscles around the lips, without straining or overly forcing. (If someone were to look at you, they may not even notice you’re smiling.) The mind-body connection teaches us that the mind can influence the body, but the reverse communication linkage — body to mind — is also true. The body can inform the brain and, in this case, it’s a small brain hack used to signal to the brain/nervous system that everything is OK, that you’re safe and that you’re content. Your nervous system darn well knows you wouldn’t be smiling if you were in actual danger! The smile will help to enable both the brain and the body to relax. (And you’ll resemble a peaceful, happy meditating Buddha!) Step 3: Breath Technique Ok, picture a Buddha figure with a nice round belly. This breathing technique calls for soft belly, or diaphragmatic breathing, where the belly rounds, fills and puffs up on the inhale (imagine that Buddha belly!), and contracts/empties on the exhale (remember “e” for exhale/empties!) A good majority of stressed, overworked adults simply aren’t breathing correctly. Adrenaline in the system often leads us to reverse the inhale/exhale process, where we take shallow, chest breaths (rather than full, belly breaths) — which isn’t as effective at oxygenating the blood. Additionally, shallow, sharp breaths from the upper chest area (and not from the belly/diaphragm) may lead to neck stiffness and pain over time. When the body’s stress response has been triggered, engaging the Parasympathetic Nervous System (PNS) — the “rest and digest” system that allows the body to reset and recuperate — signals to the brain that you’re OK and safe. One way to actively engage our PNS is through effective use of the breath. Lying on your back, inhale (filling the belly) to a count of 3, and then exhale (emptying the belly) to a count of 3. You can experiment with 4-count and 5-count breaths as well. (And don’t forget to add that tiny smile!) Continue breathing in this manner. Use the breath as the mind’s anchor. When you notice your mind wandering, recognize it’s drifted, detach from the distraction/thought (imagine it floating or passing by like a cloud in the sky), and return to the breath count. Every time your mind drifts, return to the breath again and again. Step 4: Body Temperature Regulation Anxiety and stress may have an effect on your body temperature. Normal body temperature is approximately 98.6°F, but bouts of stress or an anxiety/panic attack may cause the temperature to fluctuate 1°F in either direction (an increase or decrease in body temp, depending on the person).

How A Refugee Gets Out Of Bed Every Day,"I’m broken. You see, I came to the United States as a nine year old. I had no idea what was happening, or why I had to follow along with anything. All I knew was that my dad, who I only had faint memories of, was elsewhere, for some reason, safety I was told, and we had to join him. Something snapped in me. None of life added up. It was all out of my control. You know how little kids blame their parents divorces on themselves? What do you do when you’re being picked up and moved across the world? Who do you blame that on? I’m not quite sure when this system I describe kicked into place. It took me a long time to realize it was even happening, years of therapy until I realized what my default action was. When threatened, I disassociate. I stop living my life in the moment. I turn on the TV inside my head, oh look, it’s showing outside. I stop thinking about the now, I start thinking about the idyllic N+1 future I want to live in. I start planning how to get there, while watching my present experience as a movie in my own head. Here’s how I break. I, due to a combination of being a former refugee, mental health issues, and a hoard of other inputs into the matrix that is my brain: I always feel threatened. I either do not, or feel like I do not (which is the exact same thing btw) have the privilege required to feel safe enough to experience the moment. Most people subconsciously look at experiences they’ve gone through, their parents have gone through, to figure out how to act in the day to day. That’s how they decide what to do, in the moment. In the moment, the only emotion I can feel is intense fear. If I want to have any sort of reasonable, non “fight or flight” response when someone asks me something or I have to accomplish a task, I better have already pre-processed how I want to act right now. I can’t live in the now. I have no prior life experience of this. The only time I truly feel free and myself is when I’m assembling the chain, or in the gaps. Every thing I need to do today. Every single task, ranging from “shower” to “it’s so and so’s birthday, give them a call”, to “you need to implement a new pull to refresh library”. Every single task that I accomplish: It’s all prearranged in a chain, before I get out of bed. If you know me, you might be thinking “Kasra, you are so spontaneous and you do so many different things”. I’m sorry. that is a lie. Those are all pre-planned. When it’s a 4 PM Friday and I’m getting ready to leave the office. I walk past you, you invite me for drinks with the group you already have ready. It’s physically impossible for me to join you for this event. I’m sorry. It’s just, too late. I have every waking breath of the remaining 8 hours in my day scheduled and organized. I didn’t consider the possibility of you inviting me to this last minute thing. I just, can’t. I can’t think about it at all. I’m not here. The chain is not absolute. It’s not a script. It’s not a list of things from a GTD board. Every single thing I need to do in a day. Every link in the chain, is filed in my head similar to a support ticket. It has a person attached, that cares about the outcome. Maybe me, maybe you. It has a priority level, how urgent it is. It may have a deadline, when/what day it needs to get done by. I typically sort by priority, not deadline. I’m not talking about just “actions”, like “Get out of bed and shower”. Those are links in the chain, yes, but they’re the easy no-thought-required ones I try to do whenever I detect I’m idle and a wasteful resource. Where the chain comes in handy is in helping me deal with uncertainty and anxiety. My default is to be at home inside alone. The chain is to help me push away from that. Its purpose is to give me a route and a path on what I need to do every step of the way between getting out of this bed and when I can feel safe back inside of it. The chain isn’t linear. It’s a set of possibilities, not a timeline. The timeline is the result of the chain in action. Every single thing I decide that I could, and will do, comes from a pre-determined list of actions. Let me go through a typical day: I didn’t add timestamps to those on purpose. I could wake up at 4:45 AM, I could wake up at 3:30 PM. I don’t care, as long as I get up and do my morning routine. Be productive. Live. I should also note that every single one of those line items could in real life be drastically different today than it was the previous day. What if the subway comes 30 minutes late? That’s fine. That’s a thing that can happen. I’ve ran through Monte Carlo simulations. I know that if I wait more than 5 minutes waiting for the train, it makes more sense for me to just turn back around and go home, given that I have no in-person meetings. Just because a link is predetermined in the chain doesn’t mean it will actually occur, or that it will occur exactly how I’ve imagined it in my head. This is all just a trick to help me get over my anxiety and the “I can’t imagine myself doing that so I can’t even think about doing that” issues in my head. If the point of assembling the chain is to help me live more in the moment, without overwhelming anxiety, the steps between links in the chain are where I live freely. A lot of my anxiety stems from wanting to minimize regret. Wanting to do the right thing. Wanting to do the best thing. Wanting to be at every meeting or appointment the exact time it starts, just like my grandpa used to do. If I know the big actions I could mess up or do incorrectly are already determined and planned, the best I could plan for them, the steps between the actions are my free time. This takes place all over the place. My daily robotic autonomous morning routine. My daily subway ride to work. Chopping broccoli or brussels sprouts. All things I know how to do, know how to do well, and can enter flow when doing them. The gaps give me freedom. They give me peace of mind. I know what I’m doing, which means I can do what I need to do instead of worrying about what I need to do. This is very, very rare for me, so it’s an act of radical self love to schedule them into every single day. All that said, I know this stuff is all made up. It doesn’t need to be real. As a logical analytical person it sounds crazy to say, but in a world where nothing makes sense, what’s so bad about coming up with my own illusions of reality, if it helps me get out of bed?",2017
Day 31,"Yesterday I told the wife that I needed her help getting out of bed in the morning to run. That I just wasn’t doing a good enough job right now, motivating, and I couldn’t do it alone. That I needed her to help me get my clothes together at night, and then get me out the door in the morning. Habits take time. And it’s easy to lose your focus when you’re depressed. When i train my goal is to run 4 days a week. I like to have one day of rest between most runs, and then I do an easy run and a long run on back to back days so that my legs are tired during the long run. I think it helps. Lately, I’ll be lucky if I’m getting out of the house twice a week. I’m supposed to be running 20–25 miles per week right now, and I’m not sure I broke 20 last week. Couple that with it being the winter of trump, and I just feel crappy about myself. I’ve been gaining weight back, which happens when i don’t run. And then I feel less motivated to run. And then i feel worse about myself and the cycle goes on. This morning, the wife helped get me out of bed. But by the time I left the bathroom, I’d told her that I needed sleep more than running today. She was annoyed, but relented. The problem is, she can’t make me run. She can’t force me out the door. And she can’t yell at me for not running. So it’s really up to me. I crawled back into bed, and man was it cozy. I love my bed, and my pillows, and my comforter, and my stuffed animals. Yes i have stuffed animals, I have anxiety, they help, i don’t need to defend that to you. I was in bed a minute when i thought: the wife seemed pretty annoyed. And she was right. I really do need to get out of bed to run. If not now, then when? tomorrow? or the day after? or the next? maybe when it’s warm again? I grabbed some running clothes and left the bedroom. I went for a short 5-mile run. It felt awful. I was slow and tired and not into it one bit. I felt fat and slow, and I couldn’t wait for it to be over. This summer, I would add miles onto runs because, why not, I can do one more. Now I just wanted to be back home. But I did it. And i plan on doing it again tomorrow. And then saturday. And then rest. I need to get better organized. And I need a new system. Maybe i need to get back to listening to music while I run. There is just something missing. That space, where that something used to be, is left with depression and doubt, and anxiety. Seriously, in what world am i scared to go outside and run, when it’s 38 degrees out? I ran all winter the last two years. It wasn’t even pants weather, but I was worried I’d be cold. Or that I’d have to pee (there are two bathrooms in the park that are easily accessible from the running path). That’s the thing about depression and anxiety. There is no real logic to it, but it’s strong. It holds you back. I don’t know how to get out. I’m going to keep trying to run, and hopefully I can string together a couple of good days, and then weeks, and see where we are. Keep my goals simple. Consistency. and eventually it’ll be spring, provided we don’t skip right into nuclear winter.",2017
When Anxiety And Depression Are Whooping Your Ass…,"Fight back. The past few days have been interesting ones for me, considering the fact that I passed out cold and had to call out of work to go to the doctors. This isn’t necessarily an abnormal thing for me since I have a condition called Vasovagal Syncope. Look it up, homies, it’s intense. So I get to the doctor and explain my debacle. I also tell her I sleep around 15 hours a day and that my anxiety is out of control. Her plan of action? Find a medicine that works. I’m currently on Zoloft, Abilify, and Klonopin. She figured that maybe Effexor would help me out a bit more than the Zoloft, since I haven’t had much luck in finding a medication that really truly helps for long periods of time. So here I am, thinking GREAT. Another medication. And then it hits me. FUCK IT. If it’s going to help me, why feel bad about it? Why feel ashamed that I’m taking medication that might help me overcome the horrible obstacles I face every day? I guess what I wanted to point out here is that: If you are taking medication for any kind of invisible illness, or any other illness at all really…Don’t feel bad. It’s designed to help you, not hurt you. If you need help, ask..Go to your doctor and see what they think. Go talk to someone. Find a therapist. Do whatever you can to get better. And if it doesn’t work, try something else. Don’t be ashamed of wanting to get better and the bells and whistles that come along with it. I know that if I wasn’t on medication I’d probably be more of a basket case than I already am. In conclusion, I’d like to take the time here to just let you all know that I’m rooting for you in your recovery. I know how hard it can be and if there is ever a time when you need someone to talk to, I’m here for you. Thanks for reading.",2017
A Beginner’s Guide to Boosting Self Confidence,"We’ve all felt low about ourselves at some point in our lives. Whether it’s after a breakup, a nasty boss or coworker, or just plain old low self-esteem, we’ve all been there. And it’s not fun. Feeling confident in yourself is important for so many reasons — not least because lacking self-confidence can affect your life in so many ways life. And, much like other mind-led issues such as depression and anxiety, what’s on the inside can very easily become noticeable on the outside. This is all coming straight from harsh experience — I’ve suffered my whole life from low to non-existent levels of self-confidence. And I know for sure that I’ve missed out on a lot of opportunities and experiences because I didn’t feel I deserved it or that I could do it. I was my own worst enemy. Because, when your self-confidence levels are that low, it’s impossible for you to believe that you deserve anyone’s time or attention — not even your own. In my case, I felt so bad about myself that it started to show on my face and in the way I acted. And people would freely comment on how I looked sick, or miserable, or worse. Regardless of whether you’re looking for a little pick me up after a recent setback (break up, leaving a job, etc) or if you’re struggling to even lave your bed every day, boosting your self confidence is an easy process to do, as long as you put the effort in and want to do it. For quick and easy ways to do this, check out 35 Quick & Easy Self Confidence Boosters. It all starts with the way you think about yourself. When you stop to look around, it’s amazing to see the differences in the ways self-confident and less confident people carry themselves. Once you see it, you won’t be able to unsee it. Confident people tend to: Every confident person displays these three things to some level. Missing one of these can make it seem like someone is pretending to be confident (on the other hand, really going overboard and pretending to be something you’re not never ends well either)- when they are anything but. People with less self-confidence may seem to: It’s not enough to just look and act the part — you need to think the part as well. Each of these three parts are connected. I see it confidence as made up of a 3-part triangle: As you can see, ‘Thoughts’ hold the triangle steady at its base. It’s the most important part of the triangle and its most solid. It supports the rest of the triangle. ‘Actions’, the middle part, provide a connection between the ‘Thoughts’ and the ‘Appearance’. Yes, ‘Appearance’ is the smallest and least important section, but it’s the highest point of the triangle — the ‘icing on the cake’. What I’m trying to say is — if you’re thinking confidently about yourself and acting in a confident way, you will appear more confident as a result. At least, that’s how I managed to boost my self confidence. What did you do to boost yours? Let me know in the comments.

Following the art of darkness has been good,"Have you ever felt rage? Passion? Pleasure? Sadness? Love? Happiness? I bet you have. You know why? Because all of those things make us who we are: humans. We usually feel things we can’t control. Sometimes we feel we can’t do anything right or that we aren’t good enough, but sometimes we feel powerful, loved and wanted. Why do these things appear in our lives in such an unexpected way? Can’t we really control them? I see my mind as a box, and not in the context about thinking inside the box. I do think out of it. But I’m a box full of the universe, full of feelings, hopes, wishes and… thoughts. Actually, all we feel is a product of our thoughts. Do you give your thoughts attention? I’m very troubled about holding things to myself alone. I feel the need of sharing it everytime something’s bothering me, making me feel weak, selfish, alone or tired. I’m also troubled about bothering people. So yes, I’m a lot anxious. It’s 2017, damn it! But what if I did not tell people about what I feel? I would probably get in depression, and it has happened before. I tried several ways of dealing with my issues, and not talking about them has only left me apart of myself. It’s not that I can’t solve things on my own, but sharing is a way I see that helps me to do so, and all the bad stuff inside this box called “me” can fly away. All the darkness that I’m surrounded of made me feel unuseful to myself, as I can’t express my feelings right. So, I learned how to deal with it. I use it. Thank you for the pain, I needed it for my art — Kurt Kobain Expressing my dark feelings through my art has also helped me dealing with my thoughts. I talk to people using it. They see what I’m saying and they may not understand it all all, but by knowing someone is attracted to what I do, makes me feel along, makes me feel that what I think is worth listening and seeing. I can’t control what I feel, and that’s what connect all of us. Our feelings can take different steps, but we’re all on the same road. I might feel happy today, but you’re in your dark times, and there’s no shame on me going back to give you my support. Being human means we are still like others. We are still facing happy and sad days. All of us, under the same sky. We don’t need to be selfish, because by that, no one would ever appreciate our history that took us where we might be now. Going back to the control thing: Why can’t we simply say “yes” or “no” to our mind? Well, actually we can! But, how? Unfortunately, saying just yes or no to our brain doesn’t make things easier. Dealing with them in a way of yes or in a way of no is the gold key. We do choose how to deal with the feelings inside of darkness. We can accept that they’ll eat us all if we let them, or we can do something about it so it won’t happen. Facing our reality is necessary. Saving things to ourselves is hard, and expressing them, giving ourselves the chance to see them in a different perspective, is pleasuring. Try not to be alone. And if you actually are, you still have yourself. Write down, paint, sing, cry. Show yourself some emotions. Make yourself see yourself trying to get over something. Your art will show you the way to do it.",2017
Living with the Toothpaste — Coming to Terms with Stage Fright,"I have a confession. I have stage fright. There. That wasn’t so hard, was it? Actually, it really was. I’m not congratulating myself, mind you, but as anyone who suffers from anxiety can tell you, one of the things we all have in common is that we’re really good at hiding it. I will guarantee that there’s at least one or two people in your social circle who suffers from anxiety or panic disorder, and you don’t know about it. That’s because it’s a source of shame for most of us. And, sadly, that’s what gives it its power. It wasn’t always like this for me. I had panic problems growing up, but it never impacted my performing. I did community theater and high school drama, and it was never a problem; on the contrary, the stage was one of those rare environments in my life where I felt like I was in control. I used to look forward to those times in a production where something would go wrong, because I loved the fact that I could think on my feet and figure out a way to improvise my way through it. That all changed one night. I was seventeen. Someone I knew asked me if I wanted to perform in a talent show in my home town. I agreed and said I would sing a solo. The song was “Those Magic Changes” from the musical “Grease,” a choice that would turn out to be an ironic. And prophetic. Ironic because it’s such an unmemorable song, and prophetic because of what happened next. I arrived backstage maybe fifteen minutes before my performance, mostly because I wasn’t sweating it. I was used to getting up in front of hundreds, even, on occasion, more than a thousand people, and just doing my thing. I didn’t even bother to warm up my voice. I remember seeing other kids practicing and warming up backstage. Amateurs, I thought. I was announced, I walked out on stage in front of what was 500 people, the music started, the spotlight hit me, and I started in. The first two verses went fine. I could feel the crowd was with me. They’re impressed, I remember thinking. This kid can really sing. Then I went to hit the first high note of the chorus. And my voice broke. Did I mention I was 17? I was late to puberty. My voice was really high up until that point. I shrugged it off and kept going. I figured it wouldn’t happen again. I went into the chorus. And it happened again. I was out of control. My heart started to pound. My vision swam. I went into a full panic attack. My voice broke again. And again. I think it happened probably six times. I remember hearing a voice in the audience: “You can do it!” I think it was my grandmother. The song ended. Finally. I made it off the stage, and went directly for the exit. I had a loop in my head: This is bad. Everything will be different from now on. This changes everything. And it did. The toothpaste was out of the tube. I tried to fit it back in. I continued to perform on stage, mostly because it’s what I did. I was still planning on the one thing I’d always wanted to do since I was a kid, which was to be on Broadway. I figured I’d keep going and it’d get better. It’d get easier. It didn’t; In fact, it got harder. I thought, Okay, I can do solos, but no high notes. And then, I can sing, but no solos. Then, straight plays, but no musicals, and certainly no solos. Then it was it was, I can do plays, but no monologues. And then it was, no plays at all. And then no acting. My world got smaller and smaller. Years later, I got into voiceover, mostly because that was all that was left for me. As it turns out, it was a great fit. I worked in radio some during college, and I loved recording commercials and promos for the stations I worked at. It was fun being able to channel all of my acting into my voice, especially with no audience watching. But stage fright is always a progressive thing, and eventually, it started to eat away at the kinds of voiceover I could do. I could do spots, ideally promos, as long as they had a break in the middle. I certainly couldn’t do 60-second spots. And on and on it went. It even started to bleed over into my regular life. I was having anxiety just talking to people. Even my wife. Until one day I had this realization. I realized that if I kept letting this go on, I’d get to the point where it could box me in completely. That I would likely get to the point where I’d be afraid to speak at all. I knew I couldn’t stop the fear. I’d done enough therapy to know that it was never going to go away completely. The toothpaste was out of the tube. I couldn’t ever go back to the point when I was a kid and I was able to simply perform in front of people without fear. That wasn’t going to happen. But what I could do was recognize that the fear was just a physical sensation. It was just happening inside my body. It didn’t have to control me. In fact, it didn’t need to have any impact on me at all other than making me feel physically uncomfortable. It could only keep me from doing things — like performing, like monologues, like solos with high notes, like 60 second spots — if I let it. And so I made a choice. I decided to live with the toothpaste. I knew I had a contribution to make, and I didn’t want fear getting in the way of that. But more than that, I decided I didn’t want anything limiting my life. That was about five years ago. Since then, I’ve made my peace with it, as much as I’m ever going to. I actually try to tell people about it as much as I can, mostly because that diminishes its power. And I’ve been surprised by how, not only are people okay with it, but a number of them have told me about their own stage fright issues. About their own experiences with the toothpaste. So there it is. Next time you hear me on TV or radio, know that I probably was dealing with some form of anxiety when I recorded whatever you’re listening to. Because I have stage fright. There. I said it again. But I did it anyway.",2017
The Things We Dread,"So let’s talk about death, shall we? First, let me explain why I want to talk about this (or, more specifically, feel like I need to): because until very, very recently, death was not a topic I could even begin to unbox in my mind without sparking an emotion that was some singularly crushing combination of despair and utter panic. The feeling that I got when I allowed my mind to wander to the death of anyone from my dogs to my husband to my parents to myself was so intense it felt like a living thing that I had to keep under lock and key, because if it got out it would consume everything it touched. I felt it — still feel it — physically, like a fireball in my chest. If I allow it even the smallest gasp of oxygen, it instantly expands far beyond the borders of my body. I wonder if I’m alone in this feeling. I suspect I’m not. When I think about death, I cannot move. I can barely breathe. And so I don’t think about it. I certainly don’t talk about it. It’s always been an utter mystery to me how people everywhere — millions and millions of people, myself included — just go about their days, eating and drinking and sleeping and acting like everything is totally fine when there is an unthinkably horrifying event that is absolutely going to happen at some not-especially-distant point in their future. It’s like driving down the highway with the full knowledge that somewhere on the road ahead of you is a twenty-car pileup, but singing along with a fun Sheryl Crow song on the radio anyway. How do people do that? Religion was not a part of my upbringing, and death was not discussed in my house beyond a shoulder-shrugging “It sucks, but what can you do?” I have always believed that death is the monster lurking in the shadows; our most terrifying childhood nightmare come to life. I was taught that people who are honest with themselves see death for what it is — a crushing blow; a terminal sentence — while everyone else is just indulging themselves in various palliative fantasies. Death ends it all, and beyond it is only darkness, and the only way to make it through all the things that happen beforehand is to ignore the inevitable, because if you don’t look death in the face maybe it’ll let you pretend it’s not there for awhile longer. So I learned to never acknowledge it; not ever. Sometimes I’ll wake up in the middle of the night filled to the brim with the awareness that someone — everyone — I love will die, and I will lay there flat on my back with my heart pounding until I manage to wrestle the thoughts back into the cage where they belong. I live in terror of having my worst fears come to pass, and in anguish at the knowledge that they will. I’m pretty fucking scared of death; I think that point has been hammered home. But now let me tell you the story of the day that started to change. One night — a little over two years ago, when our son was three and our daughter was just a few weeks old — my husband and I were watching a movie late at night when the phone rang. My mother had just discovered one of our three family cats, Simon, dead underneath her bed. My father was out of town, and my mother was hysterical and had no idea what to do. I got in my car and drove into the city, handed my mother a glass of wine and told her to stay in the living room, and set myself about the task of extricating our cat from underneath the bed, wrapping his body in plastic, and then trying to wedge his rigid limbs into various tote bags until I found one that fit. I covered him with as much ice as the refrigerator could make and went to sit with my mother. In the morning I carried the tote bag to the vet to have our cat cremated. I drove home and found my son in the kitchen, eating breakfast. He wanted to know what had happened; why I hadn’t been there when he woke up. I explained that I had gone to Nana’s the night before because a sad thing had happened and that she had needed me. “Simon died,” I said. “Do you know what that means?” “I did the puzzle with the fire truck sounds all by myself,” he said, and took another bite of his waffle. A couple of weeks later, we drove into the city for dinner with my parents, and when we walked into the apartment my son stopped short. “There are two cats here,” he said. “Wesley is here and Roxie is here, but Simon isn’t here because he died.” And then, later that night, after dinner and bathtime and a story: “Mommy?” “Yes?” I asked, already trying to remember where I’d left the sippy cup that he was about to ask for. “Where did Simon go?” I remember the exact second I realized I was terrified of death. I was in the Caribbean, of all places, at a beach called Cemetery Reef because it bumps up right alongside an aboveground cemetery (really the only kind they have in the Caribbean, because you can’t put bodies into earth that’s all filled up with water). I looked at the gravestones, and I looked at the beach, and all of a sudden I couldn’t take it, how sad I was. I asked my dad what happens when you die. “They put you in a box in the ground,” he said. I don’t fault him for that. People believe what they believe, and that sort of blunt honesty has its own kind of value. But the moment that the words left my father’s mouth I knew that as crushing as they were, I did not believe them. I didn’t know what I believed, but I knew it wasn’t that. I’ve remembered that moment in Cemetery Reef my whole life. I’ve thought of it even more often since my own children arrived, and since I’ve been aware of the question that’s in my future: “Mama, what happens when you die?” I’ve never known how to answer that, how to make my children less afraid than their mother. What I do know: that I want to give them the gift of being able to mourn without being crushed. Of being able to be sad, and then being able to be okay. I want them to feel brave in the face of the one thing that brings us all to our knees. And so when my son asked me where Simon had gone, my heart started pounding. We were alone in my my childhood bedroom — my parents watching Dancing With The Stars out in the living room; my husband showering; my daughter sleeping in her travel crib in the other bedroom— and I was struck with the realization that this, right here, was one of those moments in parenthood that are so big, so important. The kind of moment that your child may remember or he may not, but that will most definitely matter. And even though I’d spent years thinking about how I’d answer this question, when it finally was asked of me I found myself paralyzed, speechless. I didn’t know what to say, and so I just said this: “You know how you have a body? Skin, and hands, and feet, and fingers and toes?” My son nodded. “And you know how you have thoughts and feelings? How sometimes you’re happy, or mad, or sad?” He nodded again. “You see, bodies get tired after they’ve been doing things for a long time, and they need to rest. They run out of batteries, like a toy. But those thoughts and feelings you have, those things that made Simon who he was, those things that make me me and make you you, they stay. And when the body goes to sleep all those thoughts and feelings come bursting out into the world. Like this:” — I clapped my hands together — “Poof! “They get released, and then they’re with us forever. We just need to listen for them. Because they’re there.” And just like that, telling my son about death, I found out what I believe. Read more on my blog, Ramshackle Glam.",2017
The Worry List,"When I was a little girl, I used to worry a lot. I was too young to understand that worrying is a waste of time. There’s no point worrying about things that are beyond your control, because you can’t do anything about them anyways. And, rather than worrying about things that are within your control, just take action and deal with it! One day, when my knickers were in a twist with worry, my dad sat me down and told me about “The Worry List.” “‘If you make a list of all the things that you are worried about today,” he said, “and then put your list away, when you come back to it in a week or two, you’ll discover that most, if not all, of the things you worried about, never happened.” Being a stubborn child, always determined to figure things out on my own, I didn’t take my father’s words at face value. I had to give it a try. I tried it once; I tried it twice. In fact, I’ve devoted my whole life to testing his theory. And you know what? He was right! Sure, bad things happen. It’s called Living. But, the true challenges of Life aren’t what drain us. When they fall upon us, we actually grow stronger and wiser through the struggle. It’s the trivial niggling worries that get us down. They taunt us persistently and then laugh in our face, when they never happen. If you don’t believe me, try it out. It’s time to take control of our lives. It’s Time 2 Lead! It’s time to THRIVE!",2017
L’anxiété et le contrôle,"L’enseignement du Stoïcisme est surtout resté dans notre mémoire collective pour l’absence d’émotions qu’il semble permettre et le détachement apparent de ceux qui le pratiquent. Il m’apparaît plutôt que l’on a retenu ces caractéristiques parce que certains des représentants de cette philosophie occupaient les plus hautes fonctions de pouvoir concevables, notamment l’empereur Romain Marc-Aurèle qui laissera à la postérité le plus fascinant journal intime qu’il puisse être donné à lire, d’une simplicité et d’une profondeur transcendantes. Les principes du Stoïcisme sont pourtant similaires à nombre de philosophies apparues à des époques ou dans des civilisations radicalement différentes. Ainsi la lecture des différents auteurs tenants du Stoïcisme ramène en permanence à l’instant présent, seul théâtre d’action qui nous soit donné. À chaque instant correspond une capacité d’action en mon contrôle. Mes pensées se dirigent vers une volonté future, vers un résultat espéré ? Je n’ai qu’à agir au maximum de mes capacités, le résultat ne sera que la conséquence de mon analyse initiale. Je suis triste d’une infortune ? On a rarement le contrôle du passé, seule la maîtrise de ma réaction est possible. Il y a ce que je contrôle, et ce qui existe en dehors. Ce que je ne contrôle pas ne peut pas générer d’anxiété. “When I see an anxious person, I ask myself, what do they want? For if a person wasn’t wanting something outside of their own control, why would they be stricken by anxiety?” —EPICTETUS, DISCOURSES, 2.13.1",2017
Feeling stressed on a first date? 5 tips on how to deal with dating anxiety,"If you’re just like any of us, you probably know the feeling: dry mouth, sweaty palms, your heart pounding nervously and this overwhelming sensation of your mind going absolutely blank. Nope, you don’t have chlamydia, or so I hope ;). It’s only a 10-minutes-before-your-first-date meltdown. Since as men we’ve been experiencing this weird phenomenon from probably 2000 B.C., it’s the high time we shed some light on dealing with this issue once and forever by providing you with some pretty nifty intelligence on the matter in question. Some say empathy is the very key to restoring a natural piece amongst people of all religions and preventing fatal diseases. Well, we’re not so sure about this, but what we do know is that understanding your date’s perspective can go a long way. Once you show up at a set spot, just bear in mind that she’s probably even more scared than you are. After all, it’s her who’s risking some nasty consequences of meeting 1 on 1 with a strange man during the evening, her female reputation and has probably spent the last 90 minutes getting ready for the meetup. So don’t panic if at first she doesn’t say much or seems to be unexpectedly tense — it’s normal. If you remain your calm and give her some time to loosen up, while continuously keeping the burden of the conversation, I can guarantee you her tongue will untwist rather sooner than later. There’s a common belief out there that every human being is special and unique, thus every time you’re having a conversation you can never pre-determine the way in which it unfolds. In our opinion though this could remain true only if every person on this planet was entirely different, which — given the ever rising popularity of Starbucks and McDonalds — is certainly not the case. Although every one of us is somewhat individual, we still share some common habits, experiences and life choices. So if you’re one of these guys who often struggle with having something to say, just equip yourself with a set of default questions you can always resort to if needed. What kind of questions am I talking about? Try out investigating her family and friends, vacation spots, favorite cuisine, hobbies, sports she enjoys, kinds of animals she prefers (dogs vs cats), college experiences, first kisses and dates, worst pickup line ever heard and so on. See? It’s easy simply because just about everyone has some perspective on the above topics. “She loves me… she loves me not… she loves me…she loves me not” — this very popular children’s rhyme is apparently in use not only by a five years old girls. As it turns out, men, although gratefully skipping the routine of ripping flower petals apart, very often tend to subconsciously follow a very similar pattern when it comes to dating women. If every time you arrive at your date spot you find yourself in a serious doubt regarding whether the girl sitting in front of you likes you or not, just follow my advice. Firstly, follow your logic. Would an attractive woman sacrifice her precious time and mostly entire evening getting excessive make-up, dressing up nicely and laughing to your not so great jokes if she wasn’t attracted to you in the first place? I guess not, so if you can clearly see she’s put some effort into looking nice just for you, just assume you’re on the path to success. Secondly, follow your ears. If she skipped wearing a fancy dress and her make-up seems to be pretty basic, simply focus on what’s coming out of her mouth? Is she talking a lot? Is she trying to fill in the gaps when the conversation dries out? Is she going out of her way to avoid potentially harmful silences? If so, there’s no need to worry. If you cannot help but stress yourself over your future date, sometimes the best way is to simply put your focus onto something else and the more absorbing this activity is, the better for your brain. Exercising, especially high intensity workouts such as crossfit, weightlifting, HIIT or tabata squats turn out to be extremely effective not only when it comes to steering your focus away from your girl, but also in reducing excessive adrenaline and cortisol levels which add up to your general pre-dating anxiety. So feel free to pop up at your local gym just a few hours before the meet up. Pumping your muscles with blood for a more masculine look, while getting rid of nervousness can be the very thing you need. We’re definitely not going to go voodoo on you here, but as it turns out bald monks from Tibet, even though they typically don’t keep any form of contact with females, can have some meaningful input on our dating struggles. If everything else fails, resorting to various forms of meditation, mindfulness, slow breathing or simply quieting your mind down can be of some aid when dealing with dating anxiety. Putting your focus on making your negative thought patterns fade away can be a surprisingly effective way of reducing your nervousness levels. What I’ve just listed below is, in my not so humble opinion, the most effective guide to dealing with most common dating anxiety issues. If one of them doesn’t seem to help you much, feel free to try the other or maybe even mix a couple of them at the same time. If nothing helps, just remember this — dating is a skill and it can be learned. The more often you meet with women, the more confident you’re going to be at it, so always keep your head up no matter what. After all, you’re constantly improving.",2017
Vitality and Anxiety,"The standard way to think about anxiety probably goes back to the idea of “fight or flight.” It means when we encounter a threat, we instinctually release hormones that prepare us to solve the problem by either fighting or running away. This phenomenon has been observed and empirically tested in many ways, and is also in line with common experience. I’d like to suggest an alternative, Torah way of understanding what it means, and perhaps where it comes from. The running theory of where it comes from is that way back in the day, humans lived under conditions under which the fight or flight response was very useful. It was not uncommon to encounter mortal threats. Nowadays, our living conditions are much more advanced and controlled, and the fight or flight response is a vestige of our evolutionary heritage, but is of little use to us. In fact, it is harmful, seeing as prolonged stress can be deleterious for health and well-being. In the Torah, the concept of life is much broader than the neanderthal picture of man vs. nature. For example, it says that the righteous are alive even in their deaths, and the wicked are dead even in their life-times. A person can be alive in a circumstantial way, merely in the sense that he happens to have a heart thats pumping. Or, he can be alive in the sense that he is always making himself into something which is flowing forward with vitality. When the talmud wants to say that both sides of an argument are true, it says אלו ואלו דברי אלוקים חיים (these and these are words of living G-d). To say that the words are an expression of life is a way of saying they are true because when something clicks and works with a bigger picture of reality it propels you forward and catalyzes you. A person that has this quality isn’t alive because someone gave birth to him, he’s alive because he is creating himself, and no one can take that away. Everyone understands this on some level. That’s why as we go through the vicissitudes of life we experience anxiety. We feel something doesn’t click, something is taking away our ability to be alive. Depending on how we understand what being alive means, we may think about it in more physical or more spiritual terms and experience different things as threats. Very great people have reached hights where even literal threats to their physical life were not as frightening as the possibility of turning away from the living G-d. The problem is, we develop a very narrow picture of what it means to be vital, and we experience things as threats that really aren’t. I’ll explain more in the following posts, G-d willing, but in short, the process of overcoming anxiety has to do with addressing what seems like it doesn’t click with our view of a meaningful big picture, and coming to see how it is really דברי אלוקים חיים.",2017
Destruir,"As duas juntas me destroem. Sinto que não vou conseguir viver mais um dia. A ansiedade e a depressão acabam comigo de maneiras inversas, o que é pior pois não sei qual lado acatar, nem quando acatá-lo. Uma me preocupando com meu futuro. A outra me lembrando do passado. Nenhuma das duas me ajuda, pois não sei o que será do meu futuro e não posso mudar o meu passado. Ah, se as duas pudessem se anular, seria tão mais fácil. Mas elas não se anulam, se somam e quando se somam se tornam mais fortes que nunca. Quando elas estão mais fortes, é um daqueles dias que não consigo sair da cama porque não consigo parar de chorar, secar as lágrimas e conviver com o mundo lá fora é impossível porque elas não param de cair. Até que cessam. Não por faltar de vontade, mas porque a fonte secou. O que não quer dizer que parei de sofrer, ao contrário, o sofrimento é tão grande que não cabe em um choro, não cabe em apenas lágrimas. Eu devo gritar. Mas tem pessoas em casa, o que vão pensar? Mas eu estou na rua, as pessoas vão achar que sou louca. Mas eu estou em sala de aula, não tem como gritar aqui. E eu não grito, nem choro, eu me guardo. A pior coisa que faço, é guardar, mas preciso, sinto que preciso. Aquilo fica guardado por meses, porque nunca tenho o momento/lugar certo de gritar. Queria estar longe e sozinha, num lugar aberto onde só os pássaros pudessem me ouvir berrar. Mas eu moro numa selva de pedra, onde não só os pássaros vivem. Isso me causa angústia extrema. E não, não é aquela angústia de quando alguém fala “nossa, tô angustiada com essa prova”. Não, ela é aquela angústia de verdade, aquela que aperta o peito, aquela que tu sente que está tão só que parece viver sozinha no universo. É dessa angústia que estou falando. Se você nunca sentiu espero que nunca sinta, não desejo a ninguém sentimento tão agonizante. A ansiedade e a depressão acabam comigo, de forma tão dolorida que muitas vezes não levanto da cama pra nada. É nessas vezes que sinto que não deveria existir, que estar viva é um incômodo, que se for pra sentir tal dor é melhor nem viver. Mas eu vivo. Porque continuo vivendo? Porque continuo lutando mesmo com todas as forças contra meu favor? Porque insisto em viver mais um dia? Eu não consigo responder essas perguntas, porque estou no modo automático, aquele modo que vivemos quando não sentimos mais nada, nem ao menos dor. O ser humano persiste em viver, porque estamos aqui pra isso, se fosse pra não viver, não teríamos nem nascido, e já que nascemos vamos fazer com que a famosa vida dure o tanto quanto precisamos pra buscar a felicidade. Talvez a esperança de que um dia, nem que seja por alguns segundos, eu saiba e sinta o que é ser feliz plenamente, seja o motivo que ainda me faz abrir os olhos todo dia de manhã.",2017
Consumir,"A depressão me consome. Me consome de forma tão profunda que é difícil descrever. Me consome tanto que me faz sofrer por tudo e todos. Basta um problema de um amigo surgir que já estou sofrendo por ele também. Porque não basta os meus problemas e aflições, a depressão tem que me fazer sofrer por todas pessoas a minha volta. Porque é disso que ela vive, de sofrimento alheio. E quanto mais alguém sofre, mais isso me consome, mais ela me consome. E cada vez mais vou me afundando, em um mar de tanta angústia que me faz querer sumir, ou melhor, morrer. Porque só isso seria a solução, apenas morrer acabaria com a dor que sinto a cada passo dado além da cama. O pior não é estar tão amargurada a ponto de querer morrer. O pior é sentir que estou tão só nesse martírio que meu peito diminui a ponto de não conseguir respirar, de não conseguir me mexer, de não conseguir viver. Mas pra mim, por graça de forças que não é possível explicar, eu tive sorte. Nunca me machuquei propositalmente. Porque? Essa preocupação toda que a depressão me proporcionou, agiu a meu favor, pois a cada vontade que tive de me machucar ou me matar, pensava na minha família, e o que iriam sentir e sofrer. Isso me desmoronava, escondia a gilete de volta na gaveta e continuava vivendo, ou melhor, existindo. A cada tristeza dentro de mim, eu mesma me motivava pensando “amanhã vai ser melhor, tua família te ama, ela ta aqui contigo te dizendo isso, não pode decepcioná-los”. As vezes isso ajudava, em outras isso não foi o bastante. Foi difícil começar a viver por mim e não por eles. Até hoje não sei se isso é possível e não sei se estou fazendo isso. Se não tivesse eles é provável que já não estivesse nesse mundo. A depressão me consumiu ontem, me consume hoje e continuará me consumindo amanhã, mas quem sou eu pra deixar ela me dizimar?",2017
Diary of a Madman?,"Confessions a smarter person may not have confessed? Well as I have mentioned more times then I care to count, stress and anxiety always find ways to seek up on me. This time it has a bit of a valid reason in part due to the family being sick this week. During this time I haven’t felt too good myself, which in turn fires up the anxiety that lives within me.   So I’ve been waking up at night with my chest pounding feeling pretty anxious. This morning was no different; it took a while to finally calm down so I could begin the day. My mind was racing all over the place, thinking about the book, a vacation we are planned, and whatever other situation my anxious mind could throw at me.   My first though was to ditch whatever plans I had and focus on calming down. Then I reminded myself that there have been so many days like this in the past. Where I’d stress out about a situation only to realize what I was stressing about wasn’t worth the time I spent worrying. But since I began typing it’s crossed my mind that I should breathe deeply, consider my options, and not to panic… too much.   It would be so easy to just hide my head under the covers. But for whatever reason, there’s some insane spark in me that refuses to give in (let’s call it “the crazy”). Seriously, I think it comes from the fact that at one time things were “normal”, and that what’s going on now this isn’t normal. So for the moment I’ll just sit here and chill (which by the way isn’t hard to do in February) and take a critical look at what needs to be done.

Change The Way You Sleep — A Sleep Improvement Plan,"We all need it, but most of us don’t get it the way we want, or enough of it. I’m talking, of course, about sleep. And with 1 in 3 adults not getting enough of it, it’s an important issue. Long story short, if you’re not getting enough sleep, you will be slowly wearing down your mind and body. From the obvious tiredness, to heart disease, high blood pressure, looking old before your time, weight gain and a slower reaction time, sleeping properly is a basic element of looking after yourself and your mental health. As with all of my posts, the tips and advice I give is straight from my experience. Unlike depression or anxiety, the way that people experience insomnia (not being able to sleep) is pretty much the same: Most people will experience a combination of the two. Either way, it’s a horrible, frustrating experience. And I should know. I’ve battled with insomnia on and off for the past 10 years. Insomnia can be triggered by any number of things. For me, it began with stress — I was organizing a big, black tie ball at my university, and I needed to find $8000 in 3 days, or the event wouldn’t happen. It was the first time in my life that I lay awake at night, listening to weird noises from my stomach and staring at my bedroom ceiling and having no idea what to do. The situation was so stressful, I couldn’t sleep, no matter what. Other reasons I couldn’t sleep over the years have been: So I did some research, and came up with a sleep plan. And it took time. But finally, after a bit of practice and patience, I managed to work my way up to a regular 7–8 hours a night — even on a Sunday night. Nowadays, I even fall asleep on the sofa, watching a tv show or film! Before I tell you how to do it, you need to know how not to do it: Using this plan and changing the way you sleep takes practice. Your sleep patters won’t change overnight, but if you stick to this list, they will start to change pretty quickly — for me, it took about 3 or 4 nights until I saw an improvement. It took a full month before I was sleeping properly, every single night. For other people who’ve followed my plan, it’s taken them as little as 2 weeks to see a regular improvement. If I could give you one tip, it’s that you shouldn’t expect your sleeping patterns to change immediately — and that if you stick to the plan below, you’ll see great results. Let’s get you started. Here’s how I did it. It may sound funny, but having a routine every night before bedtime helps you change the way you sleep. Think about it — your mind likes repeated patterns. So why should preparing yourself for sleep be any different? Getting yourself into a habit before you go to sleep trains your mind to expect whatever you’ve trained it to. A tip here: it’s best to have relaxing activities in your routine, rather than anything that risks you being too awake and energetic just before you go to sleep. What worked for me: I tried a few things before I found the right routine, but after a few tries, I settled on having a hot shower, watching TV, then getting into bed and reading for an hour. This allows my mind and body to wind down in stages, no matter what has happened during the day. Following on from the above, it’s best to stick to your routine as closely as you can for the first month or so — and that includes at the weekends. The bedtime routine mentioned above also applies to the morning after. If you’re used to having a certain wake up time during the weekday, once you’ve started sticking to a sleep routine, you’ll find you’re waking up at similar times at the weekend. This is how it should be. Of course, if you still feel tired, feel free to sleep in a little longer — my general advice is for no longer than 1–1.5 hours longer than your weekday wake up time. What worked for me: For the first 2 weeks of my bedtime routine, I noticed I was waking up at around the same time I did during the working week. At first I would go back to sleep for a few hours, but then find it hard to get back into my routine for Sunday night. After a few more weeks of sticking to it, I noticed that my body started naturally making me sleepy at certain times — and waking me up refreshed in the mornings. So I went with it, and had no problem getting back into the swing on Sunday nights. This one is scientifically proven, but otherwise, the reason is simple: if your phone makes a noise, you are going to want to look at it. Electronics such as smartphones and laptops emit blue light, which is not only harmful for your eyes — it tricks your brain into thinking it’s daylight, which alerts your brain to wake you up. The result is, every time you look a your phone or laptop, you’re telling your brain that it’s not the time to go to sleep. You see where this is going… What worked for me: I’m a self-confessed laptop and smartphone kinda gal. This one was the hardest habit to kick, so I did it gradually. if I was using my laptop for 2 hours before bed (or in bed), I slowly cut down to 1 hour of laptop and 1 hour of reading. Then, I cut down some more — 30 minutes of laptop and 1.5 hours of reading. After about a month, I was falling asleep with my face in my book! The trick is to leave your laptop and phone outside your bedroom (especially on a cold night) and get so comfortable that you don’t want to leave- and to buy an alarm clock to use instead of your phone. This one is a neat little trick, which is common sense when you think about it — but one that most people don;t really see as something related to their insomnia. Have you ever felt too full to go to sleep? Or had to get up from bed because you needed the bathroom, then couldn’t get back to sleep after? You need a food and drink cut off time. Before my sleep routine, I always noticed that I needed to pee just before bedtime, and sometimes I’d lie awake at night with a stomachache, as I had just eaten. Once I chose to put away the midnight pizza (yes, there was a lot of midnight pizza in those days) and to hold off on drinking things before bed, I could get to sleep quicker, and stay asleep longer. What worked for me: Caffeine cut offs are important too. I will drink my last cup of coffee by 4pm (and none at weekends), and make sure I’ve eaten by 8.30pm at the very latest. My last drink will be by 9.30pm. Our bodies generally need around 2–3 hours to digest and process food, so giving yourself a 2–3 hour window before bed to deal lets your body deal with it. I also make sure to go to the bathroom before I settle into bed to read — it’s an important detail of my routine! Help yourself out here — make your room be the best it can be for sleeping. That means – If light is coming through your curtains, buy some blackout material and attach it behind them. Try to find out where the light is creeping through, and find ways to block it out — a well-placed ornament or stuffed toy works wonders. Having a quiet environment is important too — I ended up rearranging my bedroom, to put my cupboards against a wall shared with some very noisy neighbors lived. While it didn’t block them completely, it did reduce the noise by about 50% — and then I bought a white noise machine. No distractions, means no distractions — so whether that’s a pet (who move around and can jump on you int he night, or demand attention), your phone or laptop (discussed above), this one is open to your interpretation. What worked for me: I made a makeshift curtain for a small window which would wake me up when the sun rose, and I have given my cats a shift sleeping next to me while I’m reading — but as soon as it’s my bedtime, they’re in the living room. Surprisingly, having the right room temperature is more important that the time you go to bed or how dark the room is. Because we lose body heat during sleep, you’d think that having a warmer room is a better idea, right? Well no. It turns out, the colder we are, the more blankets we can use — which subconsciously comforts us, calming us down and making us more settled for sleep. So it’s always better to have your room a little on the cooler side. This works both ways by the way — if you’re too cold, you’ll need to warm up a bit to make sure you’ll be sleeping without disturbance. What worked for me: I’m freezing in the winter, so I wear a pair of socks and a hoodie over my pajamas. In the summer, I sleep with a standing fan — blowing into the room, but not directly at me, and always on low. I have it on timer so it comes on just before my bedtime, and switches off just after sunrise, which is the coolest hour of the day time. Good sleep practices (‘sleep hygiene’) also relates to general personal hygiene. Having a shower as a part of your routine not only helps you wind down after your day, but also leaves you clean to get into bed, and keeps your bed a cleaner place. This goes for your bedsheets and pajamas. Being in cleaner sheets and PJs will make you feel better — and anything that makes you feel better makes you sleep better, right? What worked for me: I wash my bedsheets regularly — once a week, sometimes more if a cat has an accident, and I change my pajamas anywhere from 3 times a week to once a week, depending on the season. This one sounds tough, but if you get into the practice of it, it will become pretty easy! Sometimes, we’re still irritated or mulling over something that happened to us earlier in the day. Maybe we’re stressed out about something happening tomorrow. Either way, it keeps us up at night and we lie awake thinking about it. One way to let go of all these fears and anxieties is to write them down. That way, you’re literally transferring them from your head to the paper. Sometimes it’s good to add a little mantra as you do this, such as ‘I’m letting go of these things, I won’t think about them now’. What worked for me: I say everything that’s bugging me out loud to my husband. He either gives advice on it, or acknowledges it’s not something I should be thinking about. He listens most of the time, by the looks of it. Look, I did mention at the beginning of this post that it won’t be an instant thing — this is something you have to stick to! And, for the first couple of days, and maybe even weeks, you might have nights where you can’t get to sleep, or cant stay sleep, and you’re going to be lying there awake. And that’s completely ok. The best thing to do, is to give yourself ten minutes — don’t look at the clock (it will only stress you out) — but what feels like ten minutes (most insomniacs can count time without clocks) — and then go to another room. Try to avoid the TV (remember that blue light we discussed?) or anything that will make you more awake. The best bet is reading, or even writing down your thoughts. What worked for me: I did find myself lying awake at night, and getting very frustrated. So I went to join the cats in the living room, read for a bit and then — and only then — when I felt like I might be able to sleep, did I go back to the bedroom. It took a few hours at the beginning, but that time soon got cut down. Then I wasn’t doing it at all. You should be training your brain to see the bedroom as a place for sleep. And there you have it. A super-duper, tried and tested, long, step-by-step guide to changing the way you sleep for the better. So tell me — did it work for you? Are you having any issues with the sleep plan?

Adventures in Biofeedback,"I went looking for stress relief, but I found pseudoscience babble I should have known the therapist I was going to see was a little kooky when she told me, in our initial phone conversation, that all medicines are poison. “Do you know that? Medicines are poison to the body,” she said, almost as an aside. “Um, ok? But you said you do biofeedback, right?” “Yes, we use that as part of our program.” Biofeedback has been touted as a treatment for a variety of mental health conditions, with claims of its effectiveness ranging from dubious to confirmed in clinical trials. I’ve seen studies describing potential benefits for people with ADHD, depression and autism as well as high performance athletes. The way it works is a provider will measure some sort of electrical output from your body — whether it’s EEG readings (brainwaves), muscle tone, heart rate or other response factor. The user then sees what thoughts, memories or behaviors cause the readings to spike and then attempting to self-modulate these reactions. I figured it couldn’t hurt to try this non-invasive treatment, and if it worked, would give me another “tool” to help deal with stress and anxiety. And if not, the only thing I would have lost is time. It was my doctor who first recommended I try biofeedback, about a year ago. But I was busy and didn’t start looking in earnest until January this year. My search wasn’t super extensive. I simply googled the term and looked at what popped up on Yelp. Only a few providers came up in the search, and it wasn’t clear if they actually did it or someone just mentioned it in the comments. I called three different places, and the one that was most responsive was the one I ended up going to. The Yelp reviews, all four of them, were fantastic. “They have been my life savers. Since I started going [to the center] I been having so many accomplishments. My life keeps getting better and better!!!” And another: “ This center is lifesaving, No. It is more than that, it is soul saving.” When I arrived at the “center” the next week, I wasn’t certain I had the right address. Given it’s official sounding name, I expected an official-looking facility, or an office building, or even a professional suite. Instead, it was a private home at the end of a quiet cul-de-sac. This can’t be right, I thought, as I rechecked the address from the website. But it was. I pulled into the empty driveway, got out and rang the doorbell. No one answered for what seemed like a long time, given that I had an appointment and was on time, if not a few minutes late. Finally, a woman answered the door. She was in her mid-fifties, had fading blonde hair and wore a grey blazer, jeans and black framed glasses. She was a dead-ringer for my mother-in-law. “Is it ok for me to park in the driveway?” I asked. The driveway was deep and wide and could fit four cars and a boat, if one was so inclined. “It’s ok for your first time, but usually we ask that you park in the street,” she said. I turned around to make sure it was, in fact, empty. Yes, it was. The woman, let’s call her Jane, because I honestly forgot her name and also don’t want to publicly embarrass someone who was genuinely nice and sincere in wanting to help me, gave off the vibe of being a former hippie and potentially high, right then at that moment. My mother-in-law is also a kooky unreconstructed hippie, so unfortunately the association tainted my opinion of Jane as a serious health professional. Upon entering the home, she showed me the “Welcome center,” or a glass case in the hallway that displayed some pamphlets extolling new age ideas as well as some T-shirts with the center’s name on it. Swag, basically. We continued on the tour of her home. “And here is our detox center,” she said, pointing to a few bottles of natural supplements on her kitchen counter. “Once we get you off the drugs, you’ll probably take some supplements,” she told me. Jane emphasized the word drugs, as if she meant drugs-drugs, like heroin or meth, and not the actual prescription medication I take for anxiety and depression. There was pity in her voice, for my “dependency” on legit medicines that do help millions of people deal with serious mental health issues. She repeated the idea that all medications are poison, and that for her treatment to truly work, I would need to eventually stop taking these FDA-approved drugs and switch to herbal remedies. As someone who works in the health industry and believes in evidence-based medicine, I’m wary of anyone who promotes cleanses, detox treatments and supplements. Most, if not all, of them are shams, and potentially harmful. I could already tell this wasn’t likely to work out for me, but I was in serious need of relief. My life had grown hectic in the past few months and I was looking for new ways of dealing with stress and anxiety. I have three rambunctious children under the age of 10, and my eldest is on the severe side of the autism spectrum, unable to communicate her basic wants and needs. She was also recently diagnosed with epilepsy, after having a couple of frightening seizures over the holidays. As for me personally, I herniated a disc in my lower back in September, was trying to deal with the resulting sciatica, and discovered via an MRI that my lower disc was degenerated to the point where one doctor suggested I would need spinal fusion surgery. Oh, and my wife is a full-time law school student, so I’ve had to take over more of the household management stuff that I’m not very good at like keeping schedules, extensive cleaning and buying presents for my kids friends’ birthdays before the parties start and not a week later. Work-wise, I’ve always held stressful jobs — 13 years as a journalist and four as a PR guy — and am usually calm when difficult situations flare up. But coming home to screaming children every day, in addition to everything else going on, had set me on edge the past few years, beyond the point of a glass of wine being able to help. Jane continued the tour. We went into the zen-like backyard. In the corner against the house, she showed me her “three person sauna,” with two kinds of heat: infrared and hot stone. Jane prefers hot stone, although infrared would help with the detox as well. Back in the house, down a hallway we entered the therapy room, which had a couch, a physician’s bed covered in a white sheet with a sign that said “do not sit on the table.” Against another wall was a desk and rocking chair that faced a white board. Jane asked me to sit in the rocking chair. I plopped down and immediately felt like a grade schooler — the chair was low to the ground, and Jane towered over me as she stood in front of the desk. She plucked a marker out of a vase and began drawing on the dry eraser board. She asked if I knew the difference between the mind and the brain. One is physical, I answered. Yes! She proceeded to draw a human head. Next question: did I know that western medicine, unlike eastern medicine, only attempts to treat the physical but not the whole self? I didn’t want to get into a debate about it, as I didn’t want to extend my time here any longer than I needed to be, so I nodded and let the lecture continue. Jane’s hour-long discussion and drawings took all sorts of interesting twists and turns, and only made me more convinced she was high, or had smoked a lot of marijuana in the past. She went into how emotional trauma, including “pre-birth memories,” can affect our behaviors later in life. She talked about a Michael Moore film and how Europeans have better lives than Americans. “But the corporate media would never tell you about that!” she said, not knowing that I had spent more than a decade as a reporter for largely corporate-owned media outlets. I don’t recall suppressing news about this topic, but that could just be because of the corporate media brainwashing we all go through during the exit interviews. Midway through our intake session, Jane informed me I would have to take a test that would assess my current mental state. I was brought to a computer, at a little cubby between the detox and welcome centers, where I was instructed to answer a 200-question test to determine my current baseline status. “You’re on your own for these,” Jane said in the most serious tone I had heard the entire time. “I may be able to clarify a question or two, but you have to answer these yourself without help from me.” The first question was: do you like apples. Yes, maybe or no. I answered yes. The remaining 199 questions spanned a broad range of topics, from corporeal punishment, beliefs on spanking children, to whether I enjoyed socializing at parties. As a writer, I was distracted by the various syntax errors contained in the questions. Most had double negatives, making it difficult to figure out what exactly a yes or no answer meant. For instance, one question went something like, “If you found a fellow traveler in need, you wouldn’t not help him instead of relying on the appropriate authorities.” Others were worded poorly, and reminded me of spam emails written overseas by people who knew English as a second language. After I took the test, Jane had her assistant (a former client of hers who had achieved lucid clarity status and was now “off her drugs (ie prescription medications) — and so much more,”) print out my results and we went back into the therapy room to discuss my situation. It wasn’t all bad — I had positive marks for communication and my ability to determine my worth. However, I did show some negative readings on depression and anxiety, which, no shit, I came there for help with. “I can work with these!” Jane said, telling me how her program would help me boost up those sagging figures. She pointed to a rainbow-color coded chart in the closet. It had a list of programs the center offered. These ranged from the basic “Sunshine Program,” to “Lucid Clarity,” on top of the chart. She said we would start with the sunshine program, which was a rigorous, immersive course. I would be required to keep a daily journal, to track my diet, stress triggers, sleep patterns, exercise and overall mood. I would also come in for foot baths, sauna sessions, sunshine exposure as well as other treatments. As part of the program, Jane would also teach me about personal communication skills and integrity — a subject that once brought up, sent her down a memory hole to high school in the 1970s when, she said, they announced (on the news and the school intercom) that classes on integrity were no longer being taught. The removal of Latin from school was also something she disagreed with, because it meant people would no longer know the true meaning of English words and their roots. Luckily, I informed her, I majored in classics so I knew all about Latin and ancient Greek. “Oh good, so I don’t have to tell you about it!” All I really cared about was the biofeedback. A teal-colored device sat on the desk. It’s all I could look at the entire time, thinking, when are we going to try this out? It had a central roundish monitor and two wires coming out of it. The wires had small metal clamps that were attached to soup-can sized galvanized metal cylinders. Finally, she asked if I wanted a demo of her biofeedback machine. I did. She asked me to hold out my hands, and placed the metal pipes in them. She turned on the machine, and explained that it would send a gentle current to these pipes, and a needle on a gauge would measure my electrodermal activity, or galvanic skin response. “Tell me about something that makes you really excited,” she asked. “Well, that’s the problem,” I said. My life is so busy between my job and my family that I don’t do anything for myself, and find it difficult to get excited about activities I used to enjoy doing. “Now tell me about something that gives you anxiety.” “When I get home from work….” I start to say, then pause. We both watch the needle on the dial shoot up to the maximum level. “There we go — see? We’ll need to really work on your response to this.” After the demo, she walked me through the program. The contract guaranteed I would achieve one or more of the following by completing the service: I didn’t know how I was going to tell her I didn’t want to do her program. Could I demur, and say I was evaluating a few other therapist and would have to get back to her? Could I politely say I wasn’t sure if we were a good fit? Perhaps I should tell her I don’t think I’m ready for what she was offering? But then she gave me an out. Jane presented me with a contract and told me the sunshine program was an intense commitment, requiring me to come in for daily sessions, at least three, but preferably five times a week, for six weeks. Anything less and I wouldn’t benefit. I also had to pay out of pocket — they don’t accept insurance. I told her I couldn’t keep that kind of schedule — I travel for work at least once a month if not more, and often have to drive to our office which is an hour or more away from my home. “Well when can you set aside enough time to come by?” “June,” I said, choosing a month way in the future so I could get out of any follow up calls. “Great, let’s set up a reminder,” she said. “I’ll do that!” I lied. While I didn’t sign up for the sunshine program, I did leave with a new energy. I haven’t made time for personal writing, an activity I used to get great pleasure from. However, my experience with Jane was so incredible, I couldn’t not write it down. So in way, biofeedback did lead me to enjoying life a little more, if just for a few hours of writing this.",2017
Practicing Poverty and Negative Visualization,"How do we battle these anxieties? Sadly, there’s no app for that (or is there?). The Stoics practiced something called negative visualization. This is where we imagine we’ve lost our spouse, our house, our car, our job, anything that we place value on. This can be hard at first since we don’t want to think about the bad things that could happen, but in practicing these visualizations we refocus our thoughts on appreciating the things we have. We appreciate our spouse, our house, our job and friends more. This practice also prepares us for the worst. As an example if the worst were to happen and we lose our job what do we do next? We find another job of course and if losing your job is an actual risk how can we mitigate that now? Should we update the resume? Should we keep our contacts warm and keep our eyes out for something else? Something even better? Maybe we should do that anyway. Once you see yourself without these things you tend to understand and appreciate what is truly important and what is not. There’s also the issue of attachment. We become attached to inanimate objects. Luckily there’s another Stoic practice we can use here called practicing poverty. This is where we practice being who we are without all of the things that we hold on to. Make a list of the top 5 or even 10 things you own that you depend on or value. Now remove them from your life if only for a few hours, a few days or longer. Does it change who you are? Are you truly depressed without them? Can you find happiness without them? You can start small and work your way up. Some people go without food for a few days, sleep on the floor, or live on a dollar a day for a week to experience how their lives would be without money. Is it really that bad? Are our fears justified? We’re stronger than we think we are. Sometimes we just need the reminder. A part of why we worry is our concern over how others will view and judge us. We have to let this go. If you have close family and real friends chances are they are ready and willing to help you if you need it. Of course this should go both ways. Are you ready and willing to help them? Will you judge them and kick them while they’re down or will you give them a hand up and support, empower and encourage them? I’m willing to bet the latter is true. Helping our friends and family and even strangers is in our nature. The things you own in life do not “define you.” You define you. How you treat yourself and how you treat people defines you. Let go of the stuff and hold on to you. I hope the above practices come in handy.",2017
Como o Alzheimer da minha avó curou minhas inseguranças,"Alzheimer. Aquela palavra difícil, que geralmente a gente tem que pesquisar no Google para saber se está escrita corretamente. Mais difícil do que escrevê-la, é o temor que a cerca. É aquela sombra pairando entre os cantos da nossa mente, o medo de perder a memória de tudo que se construiu… Quem convive ou já conviveu com uma pessoa com Alzheimer sabe que os desafios são grandes. Que aquele corpo que se apresenta diante de você é o mesmo que sempre esteve ali, mas a mente é outra. O cuidado, o zelo, a preocupação constante. Dizem, inclusive, que é praticamente como cuidar de uma criança. E isso tudo, de uma certa forma, é tido como uma lástima muito grande. Tristeza. Esse é o sentimento que as pessoas associam ao Alzheimer. Algo irremediável, sem cura, sem volta. As pessoas ao redor sofrem. Se pronunciada, é logo tomada por um lamento coletivo. E eu também pensava assim, até ver a minha avó completamente esquecida de si. E meu pensamento mudou completamente. Infância. Sem dúvida, a fase mais traumática da minha vida, dentro e fora de casa. Entre minha família, não era diferente. Porém, até então nunca havia percebido que, no meio do turbilhão de problemas que enfrentei, minha avó foi peça chave em vários deles. Nunca foi de conselhos e sim de bronca: era sua maneira de me defender me repreendendo. Mas mesmo com toda essa austeridade, ela sempre me foi fascinante, e demorei muito tempo para enxergar que cresci tão próxima a ela. Próxima de uma forma não-dependente e com uma afeição mínima e sempre questionável por parte dela, mas minha curiosidade inocente sempre se esbaldava em suas gavetas, entremeava nos fios de lã das blusas que ela tricotava o tempo todo, sem parar. Os botões de múltiplas cores e tamanhos, as cartelas de Tele Sena que eu ajudava a preencher, a missa no rádio que ela tão orgulhosamente acreditava que eu gostava por ter um dom cristão, mas que eu secretamente gostava por poder girar a roda do telefone com meus dedos gorduchos de criança de 5 anos e ficar encantada com a minha voz saindo do rádio relógio branco e azul em cima da cômoda. Fiinha! Era o pouco, o mínimo de carinho que se via naquela mulher séria, autoritária, dona de si mesma, da família inteira, do bairro, da vida. Entre os familiares, o punho de ferro. Mas Dona Maria Augusta é o anjo enviado do céu - do pé para fora de sua casa. Ninguém poupa nem poupará elogios, exceto as que a chamam de qualquer outra coisa que não seja relacionado a grau de parentesco. Cada gesto minuciosamente calculado. Inclusive os de altruísmo. Sua bondade se estendia à quem lhe pudesse dar algo em troca, e nem mesmo o melhor filme de Scorsese ou a melhor vilã de qualquer novela chegaria aos seus pés. Tudo isso a ponto de eu nunca ter acreditado em nada que tivesse feito por mim. Ninguém nunca acreditou, na verdade. Um dia iríamos descobrir o plano maquiavélico por detrás do pastel de feira que ela trazia para mim toda quarta-feira antes de eu ir para a escola, no período de 07 meses que morei em sua casa. Ou então as pseudo-rabanadas que ela fazia nos raríssimos momentos em que botava os pés na cozinha, e do jeito que eu gostava. E então ele surgiu. Esqueceu todas os estratagemas, os horários, os filhos, os netos… E, de repente, minha avó esqueceu de ser ruim. Sobrou de si apenas o cerne do que ela provavelmente gostaria de ter sido, mas que alguma insegurança a fez esconder e, ao redor, construir uma imagem de mulher controladora e poderosa. O Alzheimer derrubou todas as muralhas que ela construiu ao longo das décadas, e então descobrimos uma mulher jovial, sorridente, gentil. Ver minha avó conversando comigo e com minha prima como se fosse uma adolescente curiosa sobre nossos assuntos de maquiagem e esmaltes mudou completamente toda a visão que eu tinha sobre ela. Pegava meu braço, fazia carinho no meu rosto. “Mas como tá bonita minha fiinha!”. Lembrava de mim. Me abraçava com saudade. Não lembrava muito bem da minha mãe, e da minha irmã como se ainda fosse bebê. Ria de si mesma nos momentos em que contávamos a realidade, disfarçava. Mas ria de uma forma como se aquilo pouco importasse. Ela era livre demais para se agarrar à insegurança de ter falhado. Choque. Depois daquela visita, em março de 2016, é que fui capaz de fazer parte dessa análise que contei até aqui. Na minha mente, aquela mulher austera sumiu e deu lugar à uma pessoa que eu não sabia que existia, e que eu nunca havia compreendido como minha história se entrelaçava à ela e à dela. Perceber que minha avó não se esqueceu de mim fez eu acreditar que todas as suas rezas talvez tenham valido a pena, pois a vida lhe havia sido generosa o suficiente para apagar todas as mágoas, mas que eu, de alguma forma, permaneci lá. E que isso só poderia significar que toda a afeição que ela demonstrou por mim era, de fato, genuína. Pude finalmente comprovar isso pelo último telefonema em que conversamos, no final do ano passado. Minha mãe falava com ela, com um certo esforço. Perguntava se ela estava bem de saúde. Ela se esquivava um pouco. Pedi para falar com ela e minha mãe, um pouco desesperançosa, passou o aparelho pra mim. Foi a primeira vez que a ouvi dizer isso, e a primeira vez que eu disse a ela também. E não me resta dúvidas que, de ambas as partes, foi sincero. Só o Alzheimer, palavra tão ligada à tristeza e sofrimento, é que conseguiu fazer minha avó finalmente feliz, e libertou a nós duas para finalmente fazer esse sentimento, mais forte que o esquecimento, florescer.",2017
My Anxiety Doesn’t Make Me Less of a Christian,"I usually enjoy following Relevant, a millennial Christian publication. They often provide new perspectives on faith and current events I’d never hear in my conservative town. It brings me hope seeing there are other Christians who enjoy thinking outside of what they were instructed (and aren’t automatically deemed as being influenced by the Devil). Typically, Relevant does a great job of publishing thought-provoking pieces, and I suppose the one that disappointed me wasn’t any different. Their article “Worrying is a Spiritual Issue” by Jade Mazarin made me skeptical the moment I saw the title, but I gave it a chance to surprise me. Allow me to explain: I have an anxiety disorder. I spent the majority of my life wondering what was wrong with me, why my faith wasn’t enough to stop the physically draining and destructive panic attacks that first plagued my adolescent body. I tried not to be infuriated when people told me to “just pray about it” when I brought up my disorder. Their comments (hopefully) stemmed from good intentions, but only made me feel worse. Going into situations that triggered my panic attacks felt like my brain had waged war against my body, and instead of enjoying things that would be exciting to everyone else (such as the view from the Empire State Building or a high-energy concert or show), I loathed and dreaded it. It felt like my brain was trying to murder me. Let’s start dissecting some of the statements made by Mazarin: “After all, being afraid and worried does not prevent problems or make us more able to handle them. But it comes from a part of our thinking that isn’t quite rational. It’s the emotional, instinctive part of us that reacts to threats, perceived or real. Our self-preservation instincts can hijack our rational mind and tell it what to think.” This is where I had hope the article wouldn’t turn into something problematic, because it’s correct. My own self-preservation instincts love going into overdrive. They love telling me that I’m going to die from a panic attack (even though no one ever has). “Truth be told, we hold on to our habits because we believe we are benefiting from them. We might be sick of worrying and want nothing to do with the behavior, but if we’re still doing it, we won’t fully let go unless we convince—and I mean fully convince—ourselves that we don’t need to anymore.” I suppose somewhere deep down in my psyche, I believe avoiding situations benefit me (for the short term at least). But I 100% don’t believe I benefit from my excessive anxiety in any way, with the exception of it sometimes helping me get work done. “We may have heard it before: “Fear tolerated is faith contaminated.” And it’s true. Too often we tolerate worry. We get concerned over other more “sinful” habits, while we forget to recognize the seriousness of worrying. In actuality, this persistent little habit is a far greater sin than we realize. It’s fear that actively doubts God’s goodness and power. It comes from a mentality that we’re alone or God is just at the sideline, and we have to self-preserve.” This is where I started getting irritated by the harmful rhetoric of this statement. My faith is not “contaminated” by my anxiety disorder, nor is it a sin to be suffering from a mental affliction. To say so implies that I haven’t tried being completely faithful to God or me praying to God every time to release me from a bad streak of anxiety is just me begging to be released from a grave sin. It is also not a “persistent little habit,” but a crippling illness that should be treated as an illness. This is to not excuse and avoid treatment; I am finally going to a counselor after a long overdue period of time. Which is another disappointing aspect of this article, since Mazarin says she is a counselor. I hope she does not tell this to any of her clients suffering from an anxiety disorder. If so, it could do more long-term harm than good. Now, this article may have been directed towards those who do not suffer from anxiety disorders. Regardless, if I had been younger and still confused as to what was wrong with me, this article would have made everything worse. It consistently implies anxiety is equivalent to broken faith. It’s true we’re all broken in some way, but our brokenness never makes us contaminated enough to stay away from God. Mazarin does not know everyone’s individual faith or their relationship with God. Mazarin never watched me pray before each drive for safety, write in a prayer journal, sing in praise band, or consider that naturally anxious people can still have a strong relationship with our Savior. You can give me advice about how to lessen my anxiety or remind me of God’s goodness for comfort. But do not tell me my faith is broken because of something I never asked for.",2017
Anxiety and Fibromyalgia,"I found this article I never published from around four years ago, when I was half way through the first act of my battle with fibromyalgia… ___________________________ I have a friend, one of my best friends in the world, who suffers from terrible anxiety… about nothing. That’s right — Heart racing, hands shaking, mind going straight to danger mode; Like a deer caught in headlights or that pit in your stomach you get when you know you’re about to be in deep shit. All of that… over nothing. I never wished that sort of thinking upon myself, but I did yearn for understanding. I didn’t wish I felt like that, but I did wish I knew what that felt like, because curiosity exists and I wanted to know everything. Lo and behold, years later I would develop fibromyalgia, and my curiosity would be ironically satisfied. Fibromyalgia is normally explained by the “spoon” theory, but I’ll use an analogy of a carnival because I like them and spoons are boring. You are a seventy year old trapped in a twenty-something year old’s body and you and your friends show up at a carnival. They whip out their daddy’s platinum visas to purchase an unlimited amount of tickets and you carry with you a twenty dollar bill that will grant you 10 tickets for the day. With the price of rides spanning from 2–6 tickets, whether you ride two big rides or five small rides, you will eventually be stuck sitting the bench. You’ll be waiting on the sideline; You’ll be stuck watching your friends have fun. Fibromyalgia is an interesting disease to say the least. You have a certain amount of energy and you can only withstand a certain amount of pain everyday. If you overexert yourself, you will crash. If you crash, you will be out for multiple days. This is where the anxiety kicks in. I’m supposed to go to work today. I’m in so much pain. I’m so tired. I don’t think I have enough energy for that. I need money. If I go, I might crash. If I crash, I’ll miss three days. Can I afford to miss work today? I definitely can’t afford to miss three days. I definitely can’t work today. I feel so bad. I just want to feel normal again. I need to do laundry. I don’t know if I can lift it. My body hurts so bad. If I do laundry, I might crash. If I crash, I’ll miss three days. Can I not do laundry today? I definitely can’t afford to miss three days. I definitely can’t do laundry today. I just want to feel normal again. I need to drive to get my prescription. I don’t know if I can drive. My arms hurt. My hands hurt. It’s cold outside. The cold makes it worse. If I go, I might crash. If I crash, I’ll miss three days. Can I miss my prescription today? I definitely can’t afford to miss three days. I have to have my medicine. I need to buy food. I need to do these things so I can stay home. I have to do this. I just want to feel normal again. This. Every day. Everything. Every choice. Every time. I just want to feel normal again. ___________________________ Fast forward two years and I sit here after working all day and I feel… completely normal. I ended up ditching the medication for a new diet and lifestyle regimen. Today, my arms don’t hurt. I don’t suffer from debilitating anxiety, I don’t space out from medication or get stuck in rolling weeks of depression. & sometimes it’s easy to get lost in life and forget about all that I’ve accomplished. At one point in time, the only thing I wanted in the entire world was to feel normal. I dreamed about it — asleep and awake. Every day. Everything. Every choice. Every time. & then I achieved it. & quickly replaced it with another want. Sometimes I think of this and it makes me sad; to know that the thing you think will make everything perfect is just a stepping stone to your next desire. But you have to remember that that is what keeps humanity thriving. If you were to become completely content, you would remain stagnant — You would stop growing.",2017
Emotional numbing with mobile phones,"This YouTube video from 2014 sees comedian Louis CK explain how we can be guilty of using our phones for constant distraction in an attempt to block out the slightest hint of any emerging sad feelings. In his humorous and animated delivery he shines a light on the need to have the ability to just be, and not be constantly distracting oneself in order to feel truly happy. Watch the clip from 0.55 seconds in. Is it safe to say that many of us habitually scroll through our phones in order to avoid uncomfortable feelings? We know that we need to get in touch with our feelings as they arise but that instant dopamine hit of clicking away on your phone can pull you in with ease. After laughing and probably nodding in agreement with Louis CK’s skit are you likely to change this habit? Hopefully it will get you thinking. I, for one, agree with what he is saying. However, when walking around constantly glued to our phones appears normal in our society and with smartphones, apps and social media evolving all the time, I wonder what chance we have otherwise? www.nowandafterwards.com",2017
There Are Two Ways to Live Life,"In many of the domains that require us to make choices — careers, relationships, sport, or even our daily interactions with others — the choice is often binary. As I discussed in the post ‘Living in the Wrong Age — Why Modern Life Creates Anxious Brains’, nature has evolved us as a species to be risk averse. To avoid taking chances, to protect what we have. We tend to overreact to perceived threats as, for our early ancestors, the penalty for over-reacting was often less than the penalty for under-reacting. Thinking they had seen a lion behind the bushes when it was actually a rock caused needless anxiety, while thinking they had seen rock behind the bushes when it was actually a lion resulted in death. Being aware of these evolutionary forces that shape our behaviour can help us to break out of our automatic safety-first reaction to many of life’s challenges. Many consider Bobby Fischer to be the greatest chess player of all time. Long time friend of Bobby Fischer and former chess grandmaster, Adam Robinson, believes that the secret to Fischer’s success was that he wasn’t afraid to lose. He would never consider being risk averse when playing chess. He was always willing to lose in order to win. That set him apart. He always considered the bigger picture. Making a mistake meant that he learned something new and became a stronger player. This strategy led him to breaking the Soviet domination of chess to become world champion in 1972. If you’re feeling stuck, limited, or like your life is shrinking and your options diminishing, consider whether you’re living your life only in order to avoid loss. If so, consider flipping the switch and living your life in the pursuit of gain. What have you got to lose? Probably less than you think.

I Worry Less,"I do this every time. I wake up three hours before school, but somehow spend the last fifteen minutes scrambling like a madman. Most days I am rushing to get dressed or make some semblance of a healthy lunch. But on this day I was already dressed and my lunch was all set. But where were my car keys!!! I am such an idiot! I don’t think a day goes by in which I don’t misplace something. 5 minutes before I need to walk out the door. I looked in my closet. Maybe I dropped them when I was changing clothes from the previous day. No such luck! Why don’t I just leave them in the same place every day? Then I would never have this problem again! I am so stupid! 4 minutes until I have to go! I decided to make another sweep through my bedroom. It is not uncommon for me to lie down as soon as I get home. Just to unwind from the day’s events. Nada! Starting today I am going to become more organized. This can’t keep happening. 3 minutes and counting! One last sweep through the entire house with new eyes. Maneuvering around toddler toys and my tween’s clothes is enough to make me almost lose it. And that’s when I see my winter jacket in my daughter’s bedroom. I hadn’t put it there. I was certain. She must have decided to wear it when she was cold. She is at the age where she loves to wear my t-shirts, sweatshirts and now my jackets, around the house. I reached in the pocket and felt my keys. It was almost as if they were mocking me. With a minute to spare, I bolt out of the house and into my car. Just barely making it to work on time. Later that evening, when I had a moment to reflect. I realized something very important. It hit me that way too often we get down on ourselves, or we hang our heads, for things that are either out of our control or not our fault. Just that morning I was beating myself up over missing keys. First, let’s get some perspective. I couldn’t find the keys to my car. It wasn’t as if I had committed a major crime. And second, when all was said and done, there was nothing I could have done about it. My daughter simply borrowed my jacket and had left it in her room. Kinda cute really. But the important thing is, how often to do this to ourselves? I mean, if it is mistakes we are looking for, then they shouldn’t be hard to find. We all make them. It’s a part of life. Let’s start giving ourselves some slack. Just a little bit of grace. And then I begin to think. If I was quick to jump all over myself for misplacing car keys, what must our students and our children be putting themselves through each and everyday? More importantly, what can we do to stop them from doing this? I probably sound like a broken record. But what we need to do is start sharing our mistakes with the people we serve and the people we love so that they stop feeling as if they have to be perfect. This is something that I am very passionate about. We’re human. We’re going to make mistakes. End of story. It’s time to stop beating ourselves up over our mistakes. We forget that this is our first time playing this game called Life. And if it’s not, well then what are we worried about anyway? For almost a year now I have had the incredible honor of speaking with many amazing educators and leaders. They have come on my show and shared mistakes that heretofore very few knew that they had made. So, I am certain that, like me, listeners have learned much from hearing these epic mistakes. And that is good. But it is not enough. What I want is for listeners to be inspired by my guests’ courage. And then. When they are ready and when the moment present itself. I want them to start sharing their mistakes. It will take some time getting used to because it is not easy. But in the end we will be better off. We will start holding our heads a bit higher because we will realize that we are not alone. I started this journey almost one year ago. My very first guest was Todd Whitaker. Someone who I hold in the highest regard. He came on My Bad and shared a big mistake. If Todd can do it then so can the rest of us. To date I have released 30 episodes and there are at least 10 more waiting patiently on deck. Being given the opportunity to host this show has been one of the greatest honors of my life. It has forced me to reflect in ways I never had before. I have learned much from my reflections and I have learned much from the reflections of others. But work is far from done. In fact, I believe I am just warming up. Over the next year I am looking to share what I have learned with students, educators, parents … basically anyone who wants to listen. I have seen firsthand how my life has changed for the better and hopefully I can do the same for others. I worry less. And I live more. The world appears quite different when you no longer fear making mistakes. If you don’t believe me, just check out an episode or two of My Bad and see for yourself. I promise you within one or two you will feel better. And if you do, please share that feeling with others. Better yet, share a mistake. MY BAD",2017

ANXieTY. NO LoNGER a STigMa.,"So, I turned on the morning shows today. I don’t watch them often, especially because there’s way too much screaming and yelling and ‘non-news’ on them. Such irony but today two shows in a row had stories about Anxiety and Panic. The Today Show had a story called ‘Anxiety in these hard and uncertain times’. The story talked about how more and more people are totally anxious these days because there is more uncertainty than ever in the world. 75% of ‘…Americans claim to have anxiety’? Can this be?? They suggested people turn to meditation and mindfulness to relieve anxiety. Then I turned on Good Morning America and there was a story called ‘Messes into Messages’. There were three anchor people talking about ‘Turning their messes into messages’. Hmm… First to tell his story was the anchorman, Dan Harris. He talked about the panic attack he had on air during the Nightly News. They played a clip of him reading the news and he was in a complete state of panic. He was mumbling his words, shaking and sweating on live tv! He told of how embarrassed and shameful he felt about this situation. Everyone in the country just saw me make a fool of myself! He talked about how he spent many months in war-torn countries, prior to that, and how he ended up with some PTSD (Post Traumatic Stress Disorder) issues. He was touting how he now believes in the power of meditation and explained how practicing it changed his life. Then Elizabeth Vargas, newswoman and host of 20/20 talked about her years as an alcoholic. She explained how she had always had anxiety and panic issues even as a young girl. She has written about it in her newest Memoir. She tried to self-medicate and ease her anxiety/panic with booze, she said. She now felt it was time to open up the curtains and speak about it openly and honestly. Robin Roberts, the host of the show thanked them all for their courage to speak about these topics and how by speaking out they might be able to help others who find themselves in a similar situation. DING DING! That’s what I’ve always felt about my panic and anxiety issues. That someday, somehow, I would write about them. Speak about them openly. Share my true life stories in hope of helping others who are going through similar situations. This is one of the reasons I was compelled to seriously start writing about my life a few years ago. Since committing to writing my own Memoir I have read a lot of Memoirs. (Over 100 books actually since last January.) I recently read the late Carrie Fisher’s book Wishful Drinking. I loved her honest and open style, how she faced her demons –Bipolar Disorder (also known as Manic/Depressive Disorder), Alcoholism, drug addiction and mental illness head on. She embraced her ‘defects’ and of course did it with humor. I also just finished a wonderful Memoir called Scattered Ashes , by Joan Rough about a woman who took in her 82-year-old mother to live with her for her ‘final days’. (SIX YEARS of ‘final days’!? ) It was a brutally honest book about living with and taking care of her mother, with whom she had never gotten along with and how she came to terms with her own anxieties in the process. The very popular best-selling book Love Warrior by Glennon Doyle Melton is one of the most widely read Memoirs in the country now. (It’s also one of Oprah’s favorites of the year). She said she turned herself inside-out and exposed her underbelly of weakness and shame — which is what made it so popular. She included so many of her ‘Fuck ups’, she said. I also read the wonderful Memoir by Brian Wilson of The Beach Boys fame. In his opening chapter, he talks about the ‘crazy voices in his head’ he’s had to live with all his life. Even though he was a brilliant musician (one of the most brilliant of our time, some say) he was almost constantly tormented by his anxious insane brain. Of course, anxiety and mental health issues in creative people is a well-known fact throughout history. So much has been written about this subject. Think of creative people like Michael Jackson. Kurt Cobain, Amy Winehouse, Janis Joplin, Poet Sylvia Plath, Artist VanGogh, Plato, Actor Robin Williams–even Mike Wallace of 60 minutes fame made tv commercials about his lifelong troubles with clinical depression. So, there are all of these famous people talking honestly, openly and fearlessly about their mental health issues. So many people (famous and not famous) more than ever it seems, are opening the curtain WIDE OPEN on their anxiety shit. I really think it’s a good thing. They are being brave by talking about it. In the past decades, crazy anxious people were put away in loony bins, given meds and even lobotomies when they were bipolar or crazy. Some might have just been artists and creative types who didn’t fit into the mold or norm of society. Maybe society didn’t know what to do with these out of the box non-conformists? It wasn’t really an acceptable thing to talk openly about mental craziness back then. It was easier to lock people up. Now they put many of these people on medications. Multiple medications in many cases. I’m reminded of back in the Nazi days. Hitler wanted to create a superior race so he killed many of the ‘crazy’ people first? There’s a saying used in the 12 Step program Alcoholics Anonymous, ‘You’re only as sick as your secrets’, which is why I am so determined to write about my life now, no holds barred! So, Here’s to all of you brave souls who are willing to expose your vulnerabilities. I so look forward to writing my own story now with a fearless attitude inspired by all who’ve come before me.",2017
Good news! Anxiety Likely Won’t Make You Literally Explode,"Are you anxious all the time? Feel like you’re going to explode? Rest easy. There is as of this moment no scientific basis to believe that anxiety will make you literally explode! That’s not to say that scientists can’t discover a link between low-self-esteem-induced-panic and sudden fatal lung explosions. But until that black day comes, and the inescapable din of television news informs you in an endless waking nightmare that, yes, you are going to explode, you can finally relax in the knowledge that you are not going to explode probably. Anxiety is powerful and affects everybody differently. Some get dizzy and are unable to stand for long periods of time. Others are unable to think straight and see the world as though through a thick fog. Many yell indistinct insults at their mother’s nurse on the phone about the behavior of the family dog who has long since passed on. But I’ve spoken to several scientists, and they assured me that it is very unlikely that you will literally explode, unless we find out something different about the human body at some point. So don’t worry for now. Keep thinking about all the things your dead dog did wrong. Mother is sure to call back. Those heart palpitations are not the starting guns to an internal process that makes your spleen or gallbladder or whatever rub against a previously unknown flammable stone in your small intestine that will set off a long, rube-goldberg-esque chain reaction resulting in the flick of a spark inside your heart which has been filled with real gasoline brewed from pure hatred. This hate gas will not ignite a fiery explosion. It cannot hurt you, or your family dog, who has long since passed on. There is no gasoline. There is no spark. You don’t know what a spleen or gallbladder does, they’re probably not near your gas heart, and human bodies cannot explode, to the best of our knowledge. Those stories about spontaneous combustion? Bunk. Pure bunk! And besides, those people were, by all accounts, well adjusted. It is unconfirmed that they exploded due to repetitive intrusive fantasy arguments with their father’s over the dog’s diet, imagined on the train to work, where on Senior Vice President very much resembles their father, not in appearance but in the way he touches his neck when you are sure he is lying to you while threatening your masculinity through subtle cues you pick up on a gut level and also they probably think you’re a dick. The people who supposedly spontaneously exploded all over the place did not do so because they were converting their rage into anxiety due to the ingrained belief that anger is not an acceptable emotion and must be snuffed out. If technology advances to the point that we can hear the final thoughts of people just before death, we might find out that, yes, they were anxious and yes, they were worried about the dog’s health and yes, they did call the Vice President Dad. But we haven’t yet. So why are you worrying so much? For all I know, you’re not going to explode from anxiety. You might explode anyway, sure, but it’s probably unrelated.",2017
Tomorrow is Now,"Humanity with all its fears, With all the hopes of future years, Is hanging breathless on thy fate! ~ Henry Wadsworth Longfellow Those words may seem a little dramatic, but many of you know my philosophy is that personal transformation is the key to social transformation. And as I also always say, we are living in extraordinary times. There is a reason you are born in the year and place you were, with the characteristics — physical, mental and emotional — and every circumstance that you alone possess. Our country and our world are in the midst of an identity crisis, which brings with it some tough growing pains. Things are shifting and reaching their breaking point on every level. Whatever the issue — racial injustice; a government and economy that works without legislating by greed or medieval definitions of morality; having the courage to speak up for what it means to be comfortable in your own skin regardless of the gender you appear to be vs. what you know you are; your rights to your sexual orientation; the Earth crying out for healing with earthquakes and extreme weather and the subsequent destruction and crises that force us to work together — the Universe is pushing us to our limits and asking us to stretch our ultimate acceptance of each other as part of the same human family. Change brings with it the unknown, which makes most people kind of bonkers. Perhaps you or a loved one is going through a health crisis, experiencing a breakup or loss, recovering from a natural disaster, transitioning from male to female, or is in between jobs or graduating into the “real” world. Not knowing what’s next, or realizing that what once was can no longer be is unsettling, to say the least, when we don’t have the tools and perspective to cope. One antidote to this anxiety is remembering that everyone has a gift to offer, and when you discover and use that gift in the present, it is much easier to trust what may come tomorrow. If you want to heal others, you don’t have to be a doctor or a nurse; you can be like the 23-year-old young man who so lovingly, respectfully and skillfully transports extremely vulnerable patients from their hospital beds to their procedures, making their day just a little less stressful and providing much comfort and ease to help alleviate the fear such a situation entails. You can connect and find common ground with, or even protest for, the rights of someone who is seemingly different from you. You can send a text to see how your friend is doing. You can write a song or book, or paint a picture that brings even just a few moments of joy and uplift to someone in the midst of a challenging situation. Dr. Christiane Northrup talks about how the greatest gift you can give to the world is your own healed life. Maybe you do have the big, profound idea that will literally change the way we live or save millions of lives, but maybe you just allow yourself to be who you are and pursue your highest calling, no matter what that is or what it looks like, or how different it may be from everyone around you, knowing that someone will benefit from your efforts should you have the courage to walk that path. You matter. Everyone has a part to play in the healing of our planet, regardless of how big or small. We are all trying to survive and thrive the best we can. We must resist the tendency for technology to make us robots and feel disconnected to others; we can all do something every day that is of service to someone else or expresses gratitude for the service someone has offered us. Life matters. What we do right now determines how we will live tomorrow. As the poet Mary Oliver says, “The patterns of our lives reveal us. Our habits measure us. Our battles with our habits speak of dreams yet to become real.” We are here to heal the wounds of our world and to lend our voice, talent, passion, money and action to leave it a better place with our having existed. What kind of presence — not wishful thinking — are you giving to today, knowing that it will make a better tomorrow? Not quite sure what your part in the future is? I’m no Disney-fied version of George Clooney, but I can nevertheless inspire you to make the most of today, or assure you, like a little orphan named Annie, that the sun will always come out, because tomorrow is only a day away … (Today’s essay, which I refer to as a PGG , was originally published on May 5, 2015) About the Author: Kristina Leonardi is a career/life coach and motivational speaker who has a proven record of getting “stuck” clients empowered to make lasting changes aligned with their true passions and talents in a short time.

How to know you’re healing,"Time heals all wounds. Only time will tell. We’re obsessed with time. We’re obsessed with trying to stop it, wasting it and preserving it. However, it’s one of the few things we’re not really in control of. When we’re hurting we’re constantly reminded that ‘time’ will be our friend. This illusion of time will save us, make us feel better, and make things clearer. It’s almost as if we’re measuring time as distance and when we get to the end of the road we’ll be fine. But how to we know we’re on the right road, how do we know whether the road will be bumpy or smooth, how do we know we’re following the right signs? How do we know that time is healing? There’s a few things that will happen when you’ll know that you’re healing. Whether you feel like you are or not, everyday you are healing. The moments listed above are little reminders of how well you are doing. When you notice them you’ll be able to enjoy the moment, and other moments which follow. It takes a lot of little steps to walk a great distance, but the road will always lead you back home, to you. And when you get there, you’ll realise how far you’ve come.",2017
Waiting,"I’m scared. It has been a little over two weeks since I started feeling my legs a little funny. I wish I could explain it better, but I can’t. I have never felt like this and the best word I can find is numbness, but if it was really numb then I wouldn’t feel anything at all, right? We can’t know for sure what is going on because I had a tattoo done one week ago, and to enter the MRI machine it must have at least a month. So we got twenty days of waiting to go. On a time when everything is so immediate waiting this long to figure out if it is just an infection or if it is something worst is driving me crazy. Everyone tells me it is going to be ok. That it is nothing. I thing so too, but at the same time how can we know? We can’t — I guess I just needed to vent. And share with the World Wild Web the anxiety that is building inside me by not knowing what is wrong with my body. If you have read it this far, that you :)",2017
#BigParentingIdea — I Zig When Other Parents Zag (Children Don’t Need More Anxiety. And They Definitely Don’t Need Our Anxiety.),"They worry about all sorts of things. Will he find friends? Will she be happy? Will his peers think he’s “weird”? Will she get good enough education? Will his GPA be good enough? Will she succeed in this highly competitive world? Will he graduate from college? Will she get a job? Will he make ends meet? Will she make it through tough times? Will he make the right choices? Will she make wise decisions? Will he be able to bounce back from failure? Will she manage to live on her own? Will he find love? What if this happens? What if that happens? Those responsible adults, they need to prepare their children for life. They need to tell them how hard it will be, how much struggle, how many disappointments await them. They need to tell them all about adult life. By the time they’re 18 or 19 years old young people are supposed to know what they will be as adults (what their careers in life will be) and give us a clear answer. We worry about those who, by the time they celebrate their 18th birthday with their friends and family, don’t know the answer. We start to worry about those misfits. Didn’t we tell them how important it is in life that they pick something in their late teenage years? Didn’t we tell them how fierce the competition today is? Didn’t we mention all the problems that will arise in their lives should they miss the boat? Weren’t we articulate enough when we warned them about life (that life is harsh and it will only get worse)? Didn’t we do everything we could in order to pass our anxiety down to them? No wonder teenagers and 20-somethings freak out, have depressions, think of themselves as failures, and even think of killing themselves. They genuinely are overwhelmed with fear. Fear of future, Fear of being adults. That’s why they don’t feel like trusting themselves. They look for safe moves and guarantees. They didn’t invent this anxiety. Most young adults feel anxious (and pressured) when they approach their mid 20s because they’ve been brainwashed by the society that it is the time when they should have life sorted out and they should know what it is they will do. Eventually, everyone ends up being overwhelmed. Young adults, their parents, grandparents, brothers, sisters, uncles, aunts, family friends, neighbors, parents of other children. Heck, even this chatty checkout lady with a big smile on her face at our local grocery store. My son will be fine. This sick anxiety won’t help anybody. As a parent I just need to make sure I make the best out of my life. That’s a much better thing to offer a child. An example of a life well lived. Children don’t need more anxiety. And they definitely don’t need our anxiety. Thanks for reading! If you liked this article, here’s more. Writing is my oxygen. I write every day.

The first Steps,"Before flying down to Italy to attend #pragma conference, I was going through the list of speakers and stumbled upon Rikke. I started reading her blogposts where I came across her idea “Steps”. »Steps helps people overcome social anxieties with fun and progressive challenges.« was how she described it. I continued reading about Steps, fell in love with the idea and was eagerly looking for the app on the App Store. If you are a regular reader of this blog you might know that social anxieties play a big role in my life, determine every single of my actions and hold me back from being myself. So back then I felt disappointed having to find out that Steps doesn’t exist as an app I can use. Not yet at least. I know that I am not the only one suffering from social anxieties. It’s actually one in four who is being held back by social anxieties and many people aren’t even aware of that they have anxieties themselves. I feel that Steps has the potential to actually improve my life and the life of others — so I had to talk to Rikke while being in Italy. I waited until the conference was over, so afraid had I been. Everybody was getting ready to leave the conference venue and after having walked in circles for minutes thinking about what to say I stopped her as she was about to leave and just said hi. It was a big challenge for me :) After some weeks of emailing, I again asked Rikke about Steps as I was so keen to get into this project. She got back to me and asked if we could make Steps together which made me super happy! Steps is all about overcoming everyday fears such as talking to somebody by actually doing it. This method is called exposure therapy and turns out to be the most effective one when it comes to overcoming anxieties. Steps is an app with which you can practice exposure therapy by doing small challenges. We started working on Steps in November 2016, shipping the first beta on December 28th 2016 and are going to launch the first public version soon. In January 2017 I moved to Copenhagen to work closely with Rikke and work full time on Steps as for us this is the only way to do it right. It of course feels super scary not only because I’ve moved to a completely new country but also because everything is so uncertain at this point. Who knows where we’ll be in a few months from now. I am very excited!! :) Read more about Steps:",2017
The five year rut. An incoherent musing.,"Stuck in a rut? I don’t have the answers. I’m am in one. I have been in a rut since 2012, it is now 2017. It’s funny, because I’m funny, I make it sound funny like “oh hey I’m in a rut but I’m fucking funny and clever so YOLO ya’ll”. But it’s not funny because I’m drowning, I’m suffocating, I’m rotting from the inside out. I can read all the advice, I can give all the advice. No one can do it for you, just wake the fuck up and go and get your fucking life. Write something, do something, anything, just do any-fucking-thing. Or just lay in bed for hours on end, staring, scrolling, streaming. Imagining all the great things you are capapbale of doing but never even starting them, never even giving them a chance. I hate my boss, even when he’s nice to me. I hate how he sits there and breathes, breathes and lives and doesn’t have to take 10 million kalms tablets just to get through listening to him breathing everyday. I check my phone 20 times a minute. For what? To see that the guy I went on a date with last week is still ghosting me? This shouldn’t matter to a normal, well balanced, productive and stable person on a busy Monday morning. But to a hyper-sensitive, procrastinator extraordinaire like myself, it means spending 20 minutes having an anxiety attack in the unisex toilet. When I was 11 years old I thought I’d be a movie star by 21, at 16 that changed to award winning journalist, at 22 I was going to be the CEO of my own multi-million dollar company by the age of 30, employing only women and curtseying to the Queen when she made me a godman Dame of the realm. I’m now 8 weeks shy of 28, borrowing to pay my bills every month and balling every weekend on Papa Johns hawaiin pizza. This isn’t my forever and I know it, but I also don’t know when it won’t be my everyday. I am capable, I am smart, I am brave and I can achieve beautiful things. But when will I let myself?

How to work with fear in these times,"Please note: I don’t have a medical, psychological, or healing background to draw advice from on how to work with fear, but I can offer the tools I use, and reflections from my Facebook community. I dealt with a lot of health issues last year, including PTSD from medical trauma. Since then, I’ve become more aware of how fear affects my body and my mind. As I watch the news, scroll through my Facebook feed, talk with friends, and observe myself, I’m aware that our collective fear level is very high. The purpose of fear is to compel us to take action to survive: to fight, or to flee. According to the Psychology Today post, The Anatomy of Fear, when you feel fear, your body does this: “[Y]our heart rate increases, your blood pressure goes up, your breathing gets quicker, and stress hormones such as adrenaline and cortisol are released. The blood flows away from the heart and out towards the extremities, preparing the arms and legs for action.” And your brain does this: “[T]he brain basically shuts down as the body prepares for action. The cerebral cortex, the brain’s center for reasoning and judgment, is the area that becomes impaired when the amygdala senses fear. The ability to think and reason decreases as time goes on, so thinking about the next best move in a crisis can be a hard thing to do.” The thing is, we aren’t supposed to feel fear 24/7. It’s not good for our bodies, or our minds. I’m concerned about our collective physical health (especially without access to affordable healthcare!), and our ability to make good decisions as we navigate this challenging time. Here are some of the practices that help me work with fear: I also asked my Facebook community to share their thoughts, ideas, and resources for how to work with fear: • Transformational leadership coach, Julie Daley, writes in her post, Developing a Foundation for a Creative Life, “You are not afraid. You are feeling fear. There is a big difference. One slaps the identity of fear on you, that you are a fearful being. When we do this, we begin to believe that we are afraid. But, when we realize fear has nothing to do with our identity, that it is something we feel just like any other feeling, we shift into an entirely different relationship with it. It no longer is us. Instead, we can keep moving, feeling whatever comes.” • Doula, Zoe Krylova, asks the pregnant women she works with who are having a lot of fear around childbirth to make a list of their fears and then a counter list of best outcomes. Each time a fear comes up, she asks them to counter the fear with a positive possibility (e.g. “I am too old and out of shape to have the strength to push out my baby,” becomes, “My baby will descend with ease and my body will work with me to push the baby out with success.”). You can use this technique in any situation when you fear the worst outcome: a medical procedure, a series of tests or challenges, travel, or civic and environmental concerns. • In her e-book, 30 Days of Courage, Marianne Elliott, author of Zen Under Fire: A Story of Love and Work in Afghanistan, writes, “In my experience, the bravest thing I could do when I was in free-fall was to sit still and breathe and pay attention. . . . Every morning for 10 minutes, I sat on a cushion with a timer and paid attention to my breath. Every few seconds I would notice that my attention had wandered off with a thought or a plan or a worry or a distraction (and they are all just distractions really) so I would gently nudge my attention back to my breath and keep sitting. . . . I was training my mind, and like a puppy it needs gentleness and incredible patience.” Marianne Elliott has generously made 30 Days of Courage available to download for free. • Expressive arts instructor, Chris Zydel, says, “Paint. Make art. Use the creative process to channel and engage with your fear in a way that can access your courage.” • Life Artist and Transformational Consultant, Gabriela Masala, writes, “Throughout history, fear has been used as a way to control people and keep them disempowered in survival chemistry (which can not exist at the same time as the chemistry of creation/creativity). For me, working with fear during these challenging times means staying empowered, creative, and connected to creation. It includes flooding my nervous system with the vibrations of nature, beauty, gratitude, affection, touch, love and engaging in a life of embodied soul expression.” • Ann Dyer, Director at Mountain Yoga, says, “From an energetic point of view, fear is ungrounding. We can work with the body to become more grounded and more rooted in our power. Lots of strong, dynamic leg work and hip opening are recommended!” • Coach, Lianne Raymond, says she returns again and again to the work of mythologist Martin Shaw. She shared a link to his post, A Counsel of Resistance and Delight in the Face of Fear, where he writes, “Become a prayer-maker. Why? Because what you face in your life is bigger than you can handle. It is. Go to a place with shadows and privacy, and just start talking. There is some ancient Friend that wants to hear from you. No more dogma than that. Use your simple, holy, words. Then sit. Listen. Go for a walk. Let in.” • Nancy L. Seibel, founder of Keys to Change, LLC and life coach for service-oriented professionals, shared some of her self-care practices in her post, In for the Long Haul: writing, creating visual images, noticing signs of beauty and kindness, finding ways to deeply relax, respecting messages from your body, giving and receiving support, and having fun. • Sharon Price, Director of Strategic Initiatives at Rockwood Leadership Institute wrote, “I was on a call yesterday with teacher, Norma Wong, who shared that in times of maximum fear, our obligation is to create hope. I view this as resistance. Double-down on your own practice of spaciousness and take care of yourself. To start, at least 7+ hours of sleep and clean food. For me, it means my focus and presence in each moment. And I will prioritize self-care, my relationship with my partner, and my work with Rockwood Leadership Institute. The discipline of these three. And more love.” I hope that somewhere among these lists and links there is at least one idea, resource, or tool that will help you during these challenging times. Please share how you are working with fear so that we can all learn from each other. All photos by me.",2017
Feeling Down?,"There is such a thing as Winter blues. If you top that with many people living alone, not having a job to go to, or family and friends to be there for them, these people suffer terribly. More so in the winter when it’s more difficult to get out and about. I am lucky because even though I live in Ontario, Canada, and the snow comes tumbling down, I am reasonably fit and mobile and I do have a vehicle to get out and about. But for a couple of weeks I have been stuck at home struggling with a nasty flu virus, and all I could do was be patient and wait it out. Unfortunately this has left me feeling blah and kind of feeling out of the loop. As a go, go kind of person I love being busy, I enjoy taking time off to spend with my husband and family, and I love to travel. Not a lot to moan about or feel down about, but there you go I am human. This afternoon I will be back at my gym with my personal trainer for the first time in two weeks and I know that will be the first step to me escaping this feeling that is difficult to describe. I know a little bit about mental health challenges, many years ago when I still lived in the UK I experienced awful panic attacks. Luckily I was able to research and decide what kind of treatment would suit me, personally, for my panic attacks. I chose hypnotherapy for many reasons, and I share my story about panic attacks in my first book, A Life Like Mine. I think my Mum who sadly passed away many years ago at the young age of 58 from cancer, would have been diagnosed as manic depressive if she had shared how she felt with her family doctor. A few of my relatives also have experienced mental health challenges and in particular one of my son’s who I am very proud of, because he faced his challenges and came out the other end. He has his own story to share when, and if, he is ready. The Winter blues can cause mild to serious depression and if people don’t acknowledge how they feel and seek help it can only get worse. I like to talk about how I feel, generally I am happy, bubbly and talkative, so If I go quiet people know there is something wrong. If you think someone is feeling down, whether it’s do with the weather, or some other challenge, try to get them to open up and they might find sharing their feelings helps them. That’s the first step to getting the help they need, a friend can be there for them. In some cases visiting the family doctor can help also, but it’s about being aware, knowing how we feel and if it’s out of character.",2017
This is How To Handle Work Stress,"People at work or at your company stressing you out? How do you plan to deal with it? What is stress? Why is it important to handle stress effectively? These are the questions we will consider in this article. The way the economy has been for the last three years many people are feeling the stress. While others find ways to thrive. No matter your financial situation, dealing with work and life stress maybe something you need help with. Each day that passes, we are expected to do more, in less time. We not only put our bodies through stress but we do the same to our minds. Our bodies and mind handle stress in different ways, but one definitely affects the other. When your under stress do you notice your heart beats faster, your breathing changes, you may perspire, you get a headache, your back hurts, you many loss interest in sex, you experience mood swings and just want to be alone. The stress you are putting on yourself, over the long-term can cause the buildup of cholesterol and puts you at greater risk for strokes and heart problems. We hear it all the time, a co-worker in their 30’s, has a heart attack Monday morning. When your body is coping with stress your sympathetic system can lead you to experience a range of problems. Symptoms such as gastro problems, fever, disease, tension, lack of focus, panic attacks and others. In the short-term stress can be good. It can help you deal with the problems at hand. The long-term the effects can hinder your ability to perform at your highest ability. Everybody handle stress and reacts to it differently. Some people sees work stress as a threat. Others see it as an opportunity to grow, change and conquer over their problems. You are starting to see there are two types of people. Those who are aggressive and hostile and those who are relaxed and healthy. They takes life as it comes. They have a go with the flow attitude. Many of us deal with anxiety in our own ways. Anxiety usually feeds the stress. You will start to feel uneasiness, dizzy, you might get the shakes, shortness of breath, diarrhea, nausea, fear and lack concentration. So if these are the symptoms then the question is, “How do we deal with anxiety?” First you have to find the cause of your work stress. If this is the first time this type of stress has happen, find ways to discuss the issue. If this is a reoccurring work issue, then you many need to get management involved to change the environment that is causing your stress. Remember, if your feeling stressed, there is probably one other person feeling stressed because of you. Have you ever had a panic attack? Personally I have not but I do know a few people who have. At that moment the feeling of being overwhelmed is real and they don’t know how to deal with it. It can happen at anytime and the attack can be triggered by anything. They often happen at work when you feel like you are under performing. Ask any entrepreneur and they will tell you when they were getting their business started and money was running low, the feeling of the unknown was real. Many people who suffer from on going attacks have counsellors tell them to ride out the attack. This can work most of the time but if the person does not deal with the cause of the stress they will continue to feel the same anxiety. At work or in business our work load, co-workers, management or lack of all these cause us to feel under stress. We need to remember our attitude toward our stress will decide how we handle it. If you have a positive attitude you might only experience some stress. If you have a negative attitude, you may feel the stress for a long time after the event. Saying negative statements about yourself or the situation usually means you need to change your outlook. Replace negative with positive statements. Place your attention on things that will get your mind of the things that are causing your stress. You may need to reprogram your mind. Have you been in a state of stress for so long that you start to feel depressed? The symptom of depression mean you have not dealt with some issues and now it is affecting who you are. If you experience fatigue, a low sex drive, insomnia, tension, hypertension, irritability, hopeless, feeling like no one likes you and/or suicidal thoughts. It is time to get help. You need to talk to a professional. Deal with the reason the stress is caused. Sometimes prescribed medicine will be used but in my opinion, if you deal with the cause you may not need the meds. Tired of being depressed. You may need to take a break and get into nature, fix your diet, exercise and/or talk to someone about how you feel. Do your best to not see things as black and white. Do not generalize everything and do not take everything personally. No one is a mind reader, so talk about your feelings. Try not to make everything a big deal. Most of all think positively. A negative attitude will only result in a negative life. Did you know job stress can cause you to over eat or under eat? Have you ever been at your work desk and go to the vending machine (pantry or fridge) and buy a bag of candy or chips, take it to your desk and eat it. Right after you eat the junk food you experience two emotions, one of satisfaction and the other of displeasure. Why does this happen. One part of us wanted to find happiness or comfort in the junk food. The healthy side of us is disappointed we did not reach for something better. A poor diet will have a major impact on our brain’s ability to think, act and get. Yes what we put in our bodies is just was important as what we put in our minds. Food can fuel us or make us lazy. Our bodies need Carbohydrates, Proteins, Fats, Amino Acids and Vitamins to work at its best. The question is what will you put in your body? The right foods or the wrong foods. Stress can deplete your body of important nutrition that is needs to work at optimal levels. It is important to drink water. Many times a simple glass of water can make us feel less depressed. Why? Well our bodies are mostly water and most people walk around dehydrated and don’t ever know it. If you feel depressed, limit the amount of sugar, salt and caffeine you consume. Sugar will give you a temporary boost but will make you feel worse after. You may have seen this in children, the old sugar crash. Eating too much salt can raise your blood pressure and cause you to over react. Do you wonder why those salty chip commercial hope you don’t just eat one? Caffeine is a great pick me up. We see millions of people go to the local coffee shops and pick up sugar filled caffeine drinks. Sometimes they pick them up two or more times in a day. Caffeine consumed when stressed, can add to nervous tension in the body and mind. No matter how you spin it, alcohol and drugs are becoming bigger and bigger problems in our society. It does not matter what I think but I do feel more and more people are turning to alcohol and drugs for all the wrong reasons. There is nothing wrong with having a glass of wine with dinner, having beer with a friend or doing a birthday shot. The problem is many people turn to alcohol as our primary solution to the problem. Narcotics and prescription drugs are being abused in record numbers. We have heard on the news celebrities like Amy Winehouse, Michael Jackson, Prince and Whitney Huston all died of overdoses. Do you notice that the one thing that doctors prescribe to us, is one of the things we should not be taking too much of? Your depression mixed with the wrong medication can cause you to do things that you may not remember or may regret for the rest of your life and still worst, cause your death. Alcohol and prescribed medicine complicate your effort to deal with job stress and can also effect the relationships you have with your spouse, family, friends and other loved ones. Most people when they deal with stress will drink and drink until there mind goes numb. In society we are not told, “Hey have one drink, sit down and game plan.” Instead we are told shown on television, movies and other media outlets that drinking your pain away is acceptable. We are told prescription medication will help us but we’ll need to stay on the medication long-term. Many times we are not helped with the issues that cause our problems. We have got take a look within ourselves for the answers. And yes it is hard to look within if you are in a state of depression. Most of us have experience harassment in our life time. Weather it was in school with a bully or at work by our peers or management team. Most people who experience or do the harassing will make it sexual and/or a general harassment. Both can cause work stress. Many times we feel we cannot talk to anyone and feel we at fault. If you did not know, sexual harassment is illegal and people lose their jobs, families and lively hoods over it. As mentioned, most people do not complain and allow it to happen. They feel that person doing the harassing has a power over them and feel the company will not do anything about it. Sexual harassment can start of as innocent flirtation but it soon become something different. It is best practice to not flirt with men or women we work with. Keep the relationships professional. A general type of harassment can occur in the workplace. Many time co-workers, supervisors or manager want to show their position of power. They will make comment, ignore you, talk behind your back, exclude you from meetings or the lunch table. All these behaviours cause people to become stressed at work. If you are being harassed at work let the person doing the harassing know that their behaviour is not acceptable. Ask them to stop and let them know that the next time it happens you will voice your dissatisfaction up the chain of command, at work. If it does not stop, take the right action, know mater who it is in the company. To many times we say one thing but the other person hears something else. We have a situation where misunderstanding and miscommunication has occurred. Watch what you are saying and ask if the other person understands. Another type of conflict at work is gossip. If you are taking part in the gossip. STOP! If you are the person people are talking about, don’t confront the gossipers or start to gossip about them. Try to smile and be friendly. Take the high road. The people who are talking about you want to get a reaction out of you. If you react, they win. When you do not react, you win. It is not uncommon to feel angry at work. This can cause us to get stressed. If you are already stressed, anger can make it worse. If you are feeling any anger it’s time to step back to reflect on what is going on. Find out what other emotions you are hiding and bring them forward. You do not want to make the problem worse than it already maybe. What if a customer is causing your anger? Read this blog post. Speak slower than your used to. Unconsciously your brain and body will start to feel calmer. Take deep breaths in and exhale the stress out. You may need to do this a few times. You will feel the stress leaving your body as well as a relaxation come over your. It is time to talk yourself up, not put yourself down. It is another sign that you need to talk to a professional about your problems. We do not want your anger to get worse. We have all heard on the news of people who go to the job one day and kill a bunch of people. If you are angry with people don’t shaking your head at them, rolling your eyes, sighing, be sarcastic with your words or tones, do not finger-pointing or making a fist and point it in their direction. Your anger will cause them to be angry. Are you feeling over worked, under paid and under appreciated? Many of us do in our day-to-day lives at work or at home. It can be that you are bored, uninspired and uninterested in the job your working at. Perhaps the challenge is gone? Try your best to find satisfaction in your work. Make new goals, learn something new, meet new people and think about taking some time off to regroup, reenergize and recharge. If none of those work perhaps its time to look for a new employer or even a different field to work in that you are in. Please note I am not a health professional. I am someone who has used the concepts, we have talked about in this article, to deal with stress and have found success. Everyone who feels stressed, will not benefit from all the information, but if you can take one nugget, use it and find your balance. If you feel stressed at work or at home you may want to reflect on your problems, take up meditation, try relax breathing techniques and/or talk to someone about how you feel.

Feeling Your Feelings,"I want to tell you a story about a fictional person we’ll call Jane. Jane goes to a job interview that she really wants. She’s already nervous about making a good impression. Unfortunately, she senses the interview goes poorly because it was quite short. When she leaves, she begins to ruminate on why it didn’t go well. She replays it over and over thinking about what she might have said or done differently. She starts beating herself up, telling herself she’s just a screw up and thinking about all the ways she failed. Now, her anxiety over this is ratcheting up. As her vague discomfort becomes more pronounced, she is feeling more and more aware of the pressure building. But she keeps trying to shove it down or ignore it. Jane goes about her day, but on this subliminal level, she’s continuing to feed herself these negative messages. When she comes home, as soon as she walks in the door, her husband greets her by asking her to give him a hand with something or other. BOOM! Seemingly out of nowhere, Jane starts screaming at him that he’s always wanting her to do something, that he doesn’t appreciate her, that she’s had a long day and why can’t he let her be! Now, she’s furious, adding to the pot she’s been stirring her misplaced anger at her husband . She storms off into the bedroom, slamming the door. Jane is also a compulsive spender. When she’s finally alone, when she has nowhere else to turn, she feels desperate to make herself feel better, to purge this alien tormenting creature that has grown to monstrous proportions inside of her, now finally overcoming all her coping mechanisms. She can no longer ignore the simmering emotions that have burst into flames.  Suddenly, she has a compulsion to buy that goose down comforter she saw last week on sale. She had been so proud of herself for walking away from the sale, because, even at half price off, she’d have to charge it and Jane had promised her husband that she wouldn’t charge anymore without talking to him about it first. But now, “screw it,” she tells herself. She goes online maybe telling herself that she just wants to look at it, just to check if it came down even further in price. But she ends up charging, not only the comforter, but two memory foam pillows and a set of Egyptian cotton sheets. With all the angst released through her binge (a well-worn pattern of behavior), she feels a temporary sense of relief, which is sure to be followed by remorse, guilt, shame, and self-loathing, not to mention the apology that she will have to make, yet again, to her husband. And this pattern repeats itself over and over and over. Does this story sound familiar? Have you ever felt like Jane? I believe that one crucial component of recovery from compulsive spending is the willingness to feel our feelings and face our reality. For those of us who suffer from anxiety, panic, CPTSD (Complex PTSD), and other types of emotional challenges, we may find our symptoms triggered quickly, and seemingly, without warning, leading to overwhelm and the compulsion to act out by spending to relieve the discomfort. As with Jane, here’s how the process looks. Something doesn’t go as we want it to go. Or we get some news that disturbs us. Or someone says or does something that flares up our anxiety or fear. Or we think we’ve said or done the wrong thing. In my case, when this happens, the distress begins building within me. I may try to ignore it, but on some level, I’m continuing to stir the pot, ruminating, thinking, and worrying about it. I’m not always aware of what’s going on, because the entire process feels like it’s on autopilot, the product of decades of practice, of digging a deeper and deeper rut into my neural behavior pathways. All I know is that I feel an increasing sense of anxiety building in my body. But even that can be simmering just below the surface, below my awareness, for some time. Eventually, the anxious (or fearful or angry or pick your own descriptor) feeling becomes so big that it feels like it’s literally going to burst out of my body. At that point, my addict mind kicks in. I want to eject the painful feelings before they explode out of my body. I want relief. So the obsession to act out kicks in. I’m no scientist, but I can tell you that with spending, the distraction of the compulsion to buy and the adrenaline rush when I make the purchase serves to override my emotions momentarily and produce what I guess are the endorphins I desperately seek to make me feel better. Like I said, I’m no scientist. Essentially, it’s just deflecting from the real issues. I said up front that it all happens so quickly that it just feels instantaneous. But the fact is, if you back it up, you will see exactly where you might have changed course. And, yes, there is that moment where you can make a choice. A book that was transformational to my understanding of this choice is “Hope and Help for Your Nerves,” by Claire Weekes. I urge you to read it. She was the forerunner of the self-help movement, and in this simple book, she outlines the process that can keep these emotions from overcoming us. But bear in mind that I said it was simple, not easy. Basically, she said we can consider these emotional triggers like arrows. We cannot stop the first, but we can work to keep from shooting ourselves with the second, third, etc. In her case, she was referring to making a conscious decision to stop thinking about “it” (it being whatever it is that began bothering us in the first place, like “Why didn’t George say hello when I walked by? Did I do something wrong?” And we’re off and running). Of course, there is more to it than that (and for those with CPTSD, “it” goes all the way back to the original trauma, usually in childhood), but the point that is relevant for what I’m discussing here is that what leads up to your compulsive spending when linked to an emotion is not instantaneous at all. So if you feel like you just “come to” after the purchase and the rest is a blur or if you feel like there is no distance between desire and acting out, well, it’s just a matter of learning to become more conscious and strengthening the muscle that allows you to withstand the intense discomfort of that pressure buildup. So, at the moment you are rocked emotionally, that is the point where you can work to develop awareness and willingness to face and feel the pain. You cannot be captured by your demons if you are conscientious and conscious. But there is one caveat. Learning to feel your feelings can be tremendously trying because as the pressure builds up, the desire to release it increases. It can literally feel like you are going to die if you don’t make that next purchase. That’s why learning techniques to quiet your mind or to bear discomfort, such as meditation, can be an invaluable aid. And, if you do suffer from CPTSD, therapy and/or a recovery program like Adult Children of Alcoholics and Dysfunctional Families (ACA) may help you find the relief and healing you seek. And, as always, if you are a compulsive spender, know that you can find the help you need to address your addiction in Debtors Anonymous or Underearners Anonymous. Here are two guided meditation mp3’s that I created to help you. Guided meditation #1 — Watching Your BreathGuided meditation #2 — Repeating a Word or Phrase (Mantra) From my experience, meditation is not about achieving peace where all thoughts disappear, but learning to sit in discomfort. The practice of bringing my mind back from straying thoughts (more like a tsunami of thoughts) to my breath or a word or phrase without running screaming out of the room is how I began building the muscle of being present and withstanding discomfort. While a daily meditation practice will help you go far in developing consciousness about how you are feeling, stretching that muscle during the rest of your day will take time. But once you have experienced the eureka moment where, for the first time, you are able to avert disaster, you will always know that it’s possible … and it becomes easier to do each successive time. I have definitely gotten better at finding that moment, but it’s the work of a lifetime. So let’s go back to our story about Jane. Is there a moment where Jane could have changed what happened; a moment when she could have become more conscious and, therefore, changed the trajectory of her ill-fated path? The answer is yes. Maybe she could have made a phone call after the interview to help her process what had happened and lead her away from the path of self-recrimination. Maybe, instead of shoving down the feelings, she could have stopped resisting them and accepted the discomfort and disappointment. Maybe before she screamed at her husband, she could have paused for a brief instant to feel her growing pain, and told him that she needed a few minutes to herself. And then walked away. Maybe she could have taken a brisk walk around the block to move some of the energy. Maybe she could have listened to her self-talk and countered each negative with a more loving thought. Maybe she could have sat still and meditated, releasing all the pain and negative self-talk to the healing balm of watching her breath. But all of these maybes are predicated on Jane’s willingness to be present with reality, to meet situations and feelings head on, and on her growing her ability to sit with discomfort without fueling it. I’m sure not perfect at this. But I keep working on improving and increasing my willingness to feel my feelings without trying to shove them away or pouring gasoline on fiery emotions. But one thing I know–every time we defuse one of these situations, we’re building a muscle memory for the next. With practice, what seems impossible for you to do today may come to be your likely reaction tomorrow. If you liked this story, please click the💚 below so other people will see this here on Medium.

The Space Between Unraveling,"Every day it feels I’m either in flight or fight. But I try to hold for that space between. The one where you breathe. You pause. You decide to not react. It is exhausting. I do not know if it will ever get easier. Always on alert, ever hyper-vigilant for that ball you know will drop. Running up to the roof of my work building, hiding in my car. Safe places where people cannot see me. I roll up the windows. Put on my sunglasses. Carry my book like a security blanket. Exhale a sigh of relief when I walk in the door of my home. A safe place. It’s okay there. The unraveling is always worse at night. The panic starts in my chest, arms and fingers tingle. The sweating. Or chills. Hugging to a blanket for my life, if only the weight of it could render me finally safe. This is what happens when you never had a mother hold you tenderly. Touch you lovingly. A seriously delayed reaction from a half a century ago. It catches up with you; it always will. Even in that in between space.",2017
When I’m anxious I hoard clothes,"We are living in uncertain times. Politically, economically, socially, things aren’t as sure a bet as they used to be. But with uncertainty comes anxiety. With anxiety comes the need to quell it. My seven-month-old niece, Leila, only falls securely asleep beside her teddy companions. They are blue, purple, pink. Some fluffy, others velvet-smooth. Collectively, they are her security blanket, reassuring her she’s not alone in her cot, or the world. Survivalists in Silicon Valley stockpile food, munitions, and whole underground apartment complexes to ensure that they’ll survive a nuclear holocaust. Some believe this is imminent. Me? I gather clothes. Reams of rainbow-hued dresses, piles of knitted sweaters. Draws stuffed with socks, snug in their neat, paired parcels. Items returned to their exact spot on the rack. The multitude and the predictability is satisfying, comforting. Not unlike Leila, I draw comfort in being bordered by ‘things’. The certainty of a purchase is in itself soothing. It involves an easy, reliable process: select, add to cart, check out. I want a pair of white shorts, I get them. There are no permutations. Bureaucracy or personal whims can’t stop me. My job, on the other hand. My country’s politics and laws. People in my orbit. They are seemingly undivinable. I recently ordered a dress and skirt. They didn’t arrive. Fuck me.",2017
In defense of posting about politics on social media,"“I’m so sick of reading about politics! I want to go back to the days when people posted pictures of their babies and what they ate.” I’ve seen this sentiment posted on Facebook quite regularly ever since the election — you probably have, too. On the one hand, I get it: politics are complex in general, but this current political climate is especially depressing. Every day I wake up and read the news, I am increasingly convinced we have all been teleported into the plot of a dystopian novel. There are few places one can go nowadays and be completely isolated from news of what is happening in our world. Social media, for many, is a safe space: a place to detox from ”real life” and see what your friends are up to. A place to unwind. There’s nothing inherently wrong with restricting your feed to only include updates about babies and cute cat videos. What I find problematic is the automatic silencing of those who share anything political, no matter how inclusive or articulately worded the post might be. Frustration at seeing the same thing over and over is understandable, but over time, “Why can’t we all just focus on happy things?” is not so much an exasperated request as it is a micro-aggression: a silencing tactic. This attitude has potential to become oppressive because it attempts to shame those who feel that certain issues are just too important to keep to themselves. I am one of those people: I don’t know how to stay silent about issues that are a direct threat to human rights. I am grateful for the advent of social media — Facebook, Twitter, personal blogs — because, as an introvert, these discussions in real-time don’t always work out well for me. I don’t like calling attention to myself if I don’t have to. I certainly don’t like face-to-face conflict. As a writer, I am far more intelligent and thoughtful on paper (or a screen) than I am verbally. My social media platform is a gift that allows me to use my voice for what I believe is a cause for good, even if the same five people are the only ones who read what I have to say. I have a sweatshirt with a quote from Desmond Tutu on it: “If you are neutral in situations of injustice, you are choosing the side of the oppressor.” My political posts (I swear on my life, I try to write in a way that invites discussion rather than arguments, and I’m trying to avoid posting out of pure anger) are my own brand of activism. I highly doubt that anyone’s mind has been changed about anything solely from a Facebook post, but words have the power to plant seeds no matter what form they take. That is all I aim to do. At the risk of stereotyping, I have to comment on a pattern I’ve noticed, regarding the authors of the “Why can’t we just stick to cute puppies?” posts: more often than not, they tend to be white. They are, as far as I’m aware, middle class or above, with decent jobs and private healthcare. They do not belong to any minority groups. In other words, they are people who have nothing to fear from a Trump administration. The frightening changes that are taking place will have little to no effect on them personally. Not everyone is lucky enough to be in that position. The posts I see that deal thoughtfully with politics, that express fear and ask questions, come from people with so-called “pre-existing conditions” that will no longer be treated if the ACA is repealed. They come from friends in same-sex marriages who fear being kicked out of their housing, having their relationships annulled, or losing custody of children who are not biologically theirs. They come from friends who are black and fear the consequences of having a neo nazi in Trump’s cabinet. By all means, if you prefer your Facebook to be politics-free, that is your right. I would encourage you, however, to consider why it is that you don’t want to see such posts. Do they make you depressed and increase your anxiety? Totally understandable. Are you sick of seeing posts denigrating all Trump voters as being evil and stupid? By all means, hide those (I would too). But if your reasons have more to do with exasperation that so many people are likening themselves to Chicken Little, clucking on and on about how the sky is falling, then perhaps a bit of empathy is in order. If nothing else, the “unfollow” button is always an option: a kinder alternative to “un-friending.” Like this post? Check out Confessions of a Jew-ish Skeptic, now available on Amazon.

Almost Everything.,"My mental illness doesn’t define me, but it’s a part of me. It’s as if you had a birthmark you wish you never had, but it’s there and will always be there. Writing this isn’t easy for the simple fact that I have not yet come to terms with my own illness enough to fully understand its inner workings. It’s quite ironic because I’ve written many articles about mental health, but they’re all the same. They all lack the *entire truth. To start, I’d probably state how anxiety affects my day-to-day life or how it can be managed, and then maybe towards the end I’d add a few refreshing, positive anecdotes to make myself feel better about having anxiety. But the truth is, anxiety is like a ticking bomb waiting to explode. You know why? Because I know I’ll find myself back to square one even after writing such a thought-provoking and inspirational article. I do that for one main reason: nobody wants to know the truth about anxiety because when it happens to be right in front of them, they shy away from it or even worse, they act with resentment. All my life I’ve been a person of too much feeling and society makes me feel like a bad person for it. I’ve battled with my anxiety many different ways — some of which should not be considered — but in the end, I found nothing good come of it. I was spiraling out of control through a tunnel of disappointment. I thought it was teenage angst, but then I turned twenty. Now I’m twenty-one and I still have a hard time coping. There are good days, like when I find myself doing daily tasks without a problem, but then there are bad days. That’s when anxiety welcomes itself in once more and I find myself on the kitchen floor sobbing for absolutely nothing. It’s hard to fall asleep without thinking about my life and its heavy baggage I carry on my shoulders. It’s hard to feel normal when half of the things I used to enjoy doing no longer bring the same enjoyment. It’s hard to hate yourself for being yourself. I’d love to make new friends, but it’s often hard to communicate with people. I become too awkward and nervous to continue conversations and I hate myself for it. I remember starving myself in high school from sophomore year to senior year. I would skip lunch and walk through the dark hallways, making sure I wasn’t seen, and head straight towards the restroom and stay there until my lunch was over. One day I thought it’d be a good idea to go to school high on Xanax, but I spoke incoherently the whole day. I felt worthless. What was running through my young mind at that time I still have yet to understand, but regardless of age, I was in a state of confusion. I was lost. I still am, which I don’t believe is good, but I’m gradually learning. I want to be normal. Anxiety makes me feel like an alien out of orbit. I have no words for it in my mind to describe the constant pain I feel from the battle I fight within myself every single day. Nobody sees that. I think that’s why it’s difficult for people to understand a person with anxiety. So much of what I go through happens inside my mind. The only thing people see are the emotions that follow. Those emotional episodes are caused by my inner demons and those very inner demons lack humanity for stealing my happiness away from me. I’m a prisoner in my own body. I can write an entire screenplay about my life and it still won’t properly recount each struggle I’ve faced. People see me and only see a woman, but they don’t know me. No one does. I barely know myself. The truth is hard to explain when people feel it in different wavelengths at different ages and for different reasons. I will always be in a battle with myself, but I will NOT let it beat me. *You will sob, you will fall, you will laugh, you will feel all too much. But it’s OK to feel.",2017
Chapter 19 : Confusing Arousal,"Do you know that feeling after you’ve awoken up from a nap and it’s as if the world around you suddenly makes little to no sense? You grope for your phone only to realize you’ve overslept by a few hours, missed that afternoon meeting, and are now running late for your evening plans. One term for this is confused arousal (coincidentally the name of my upcoming memoir), and its a feeling I’ve had non-stop for the past few months. Now that I’ve awoken for lack of a better phrase, I intimately feel as though I both missed something in my life and that I’m late for what is coming next. Admittedly not great, and probably not rational. Ahh, rational, a word that flows through mind like Ben Franklin’s kite, charged with both positive and negative meanings. I was an economics major in college despite absolutely loathing math, and one of the few foundations that always befuddled me was the idea that in a perfect world people always act rational. Go check out your local cable news channel and you’ll realize this idea doesn’t hold much water. Whether its our career, our love life, or our friendships, even in the best of circumstances and with rules in place to prevent us from doing so, we often act irrational. Well at least I know I do. Another tenet of economics I always understood deeply while simultaneously wishing I had never heard of was the idea behind opportunity cost. That for each action taken, there is an opportunity missed from taking an alternative action. This is important because as I peer through my past and try to understand how I’ve gotten to this point, I see potholes of opportunity cost everywhere. So lets break the detail seal and walk through some of these missed opportunities Here’s the odd thing about all this, somehow the life I have now could be enticing to an outsider. I work for a great company, I have a wonderful apartment to myself, and live in arguably the greatest city in the world. But with the awakening and resulting feeling of confusion, I realize for me to be happy I need to start pushing for what I want. I’ve probably said this before, but god damn it, I need to start believing in that. So here is the challenge I’m laying out to myself. I’m giving myself an 18 month plan to get MY life to where I really want it to be. Here are the first two parts : First, I’m going to give everything I have and more in my current job for the foreseeable future. My head is going to be down, I’m cutting out social activities, and I’m throwing myself into work. Leggo. Second, as I recalibrate my current job, I’m going to start researching opportunities to go back to school. There are two career paths I want to explore and I need to do quite a bit research and preparation. I’d love to go Law School or to school for psychiatry. I was never discouraged from going down this path growing up, but I wasn’t encouraged either. A fundamental passion of mine is helping people, and I mean that sincerely, so I want to make that a core tenet of my career. Third, I’m going to get back in shape. I’m going to start shaving every day, running as often as I can, and eating healthy. In order to get my mental health in tip top shape, I need to make my body a weapon. In an effort to follow this plan, I’m going to also post once a week from here on out for the next few months. I’m going to use this blog to hold myself accountable. I’m tired of leading my life based on how I think I should, I’m going to live it how I want. More to Come, Mike You Will Be Found — Dear Evan Hansen",2017
5 Insightful Reads for Anxiety Sufferers,"Suffer from anxiety? Know somebody who does? I knew that when anxiety was starting to take over, I had to do something about it but I didn’t know where to start. I didn’t feel comfortable enough to talk to anybody and I was embarrassed. So I turned to reading to try and help myself understand what anxiety was and how I could help myself. Some of these books are not at all specific to anxiety, but you can apply what is relevant to you. I found that I learnt so much just from taking the time to understand things such as how the brain works and was eager to put things into practice. That’s the key thing here, putting things into practice. With a bit of trying things out and practice, anxiety can be manageable on some level, even if it’s just for a moment. It’s got a drastic title, but it’s worth bearing with it. It’s a great ‘to hand book’ that isn’t in any way too heavy or prescriptive. If you want to learn more about why your brain functions the way it does and how this understanding can help you manage your anxious thoughts, this is the one for you. With plenty of relatable anecdotes, and chapters covering topics such as ‘the thought system versus healthy functioning’, ‘dismissing thoughts’ and ‘choice points’, this definitely one insightful ‘common sense’ read that has given me, and some of my friends food for thought. 2. At Last A Life — Paul David Another one of those drastic titles, this book was my first port of call when I started to wonder what the hell was going on in that head of mine and wanted answers. This is the book folks. A wikipedia for anxiety on paper, you can get most of the answers to the questions you have been asking yourself, such as ‘why do I feel like this?’, ‘how can I make it go away?’ and ‘why am I having panic attacks?’. There are also tried and techniques that you can experiment with, as well as, lots of real life success stories. Hell, the guy who wrote it talks from experience. Give this one a try, it’ll be worth your dollar. 3. Staying Strong 365 Days A Year — Demi Lovato So my mum bought me this for Christmas a couple of years ago and I love it so, thanks mum! You might have heard of Demi Lovato, the American recording artist, actress and television star. What you might not know, (and why should you really?), is that she has suffered from addiction and depression. What I like about this book is that you don’t need to read it like any other book. All you have to do is dedicate 1 minute of your day to finding the page corresponding to the day that you are on and reading the quote for that day. So whether it’s good or bad, I like to wake up each morning, pick this book up, read the quote for that day, and try to take that quote with me for the day. Sometimes it even reflects what I am actually feeling. So if I get ‘Start where you are. Use what you have. Do what you can’, this encourages me to approach that day knowing that I can only do my best, and not to put myself under too much pressure. 4. Authentic — Professor Stephen Joseph I’m still reading this one so the jury is still kinda out. I do however, feel that it can be a great supporting book for anxiety sufferers as well as the ‘lay person’, because it talks all about how being you and being true to you is not only great for your wellbeing, but for relationships between you and other people too. If you are feeling a little frazzled or even lost in life, the book can also help you to understand what really matters to you and take steps towards living as happy and contented life as you can. 5. Don’t Sweat the Small Stuff — Richard Carlson Brought to you by the same author who wrote ‘ Stop Thinking Start Living’, Don’t Sweat the Small Stuff’ consists of lots of small essays, (well, a couple of pages long), one hundred in fact, that can help you deal with life’s little complexities. Let’s call them pockets of wisdom. So I know that I am not the most spontaneous of people, but I am not a complete rigid either, so if I were to find a day that all plans were being thrown out of the window and it was throwing me off, I’d perhaps look at the ‘be flexible with changes in your plans’ essay. There might be what I call ‘cute’ little essays that might inspire you to take action and push you out of your comfort zone, such as ‘everyday, tell at least one person what you admire about them’. And we could all do with a little of that every now and again! Can you recommend any books that help you, anxiety or no anxiety? It’d be useful to find out. Have you read my anxiety related post on ‘Feel the Fear and Do It Anyway?’. Until next time…",2017

A Letter From The Brain,"Hello Boss, How is life going? Sorry to bother, but we have a bit of the situation here at the Brain Headquarters. The Thoughts are out of control, Anger and Frustration are at all levels high, and Anxiety took over fully supported by Stress. I heard you talking to your colleagues and friends the other day, seems like a “Complaining & Worry Meeting” I host here. I hate those, not sure why you insist on doing them. Boss, with the raw materials I am getting from you and the real world, it’s impossible to keep everything calm and stable. You are always on a deadline, rushing and relying on Stress to push through. Why does the Anxiety Department get all the funding? Based on the long resolution list you want to accomplish this year, we need to put some energy into Clarity and Focus fund. Why does the Anxiety Department get all the funding? And sorry for getting you sick last month — it was an emergency. You overworked the Body, and the Immune system crashed. You don’t sleep well and long enough, so the restart function fails. I tried to inform you via constant headaches, but you ignored them by taking pills. Boss, sleep and rest are essential for the smooth operations, you know. I got custom made patented genes installed here, all you need to do is give it space and time to do the job. Distracting on Social Media, having a drink or meeting with friends to “talk about life” does not help here, on the Brain Level. I know you are busy, so I brainstormed on what you could do to improve the situation. You exercise, I know, but that’s help for the Body, not for me, the Brain. Different functions you know… Here is a simple 15-min practice, please consider this as a long-term investment into your happiness, focus, clarity and mental health. Just do it daily, that’s all I ask. Going to a yoga class once in a blue moon does not do anything for me. Please create a habit — humans are animals of habit. Add mindfulness to your day with only 10–15 minutes: And Boss, the last thing, could you treat our staff here to a salad once in awhile? I know you don’t think of Gut and Brain departments having a connection, but we do. Fast food and soda are an empty fuel here, doesn’t do much for the energy levels.

DAYS I HAVEN’T MET CHARLIE BROOKER,"My Internet Fear - Standing Out - Day 239 I wonder how things used to work before the Internet. I mean, I came from probably the last generation that actually lived without it for a while, but since it’s been with me for the majority of my life now, I can’t conceive what’s living without it anymore. In my head, the idea of an internet-free world sustaining itself is about as conceivable as a toilet-free world after people stopped crapping in the middle of the streets. I dare affirming that the order’s probably air, water, food, sleeping, toilets, internet, oil, love and mayo. Our dependence has its benefits. As a guy who loves speaking on the phone as much as a shoving an axe through his own urethra, the internet is majorly responsible for allowing me to live among society without suffering daily panic attacks and probably having a proper chance to survive past my 40s. I can’t highlight how much my life changed for the best after “online messages” were invented, made affordable and became our standard communication form. I felt like a part of the majority! Like “hey, dude, I’m with everyone else on this one!” Seriously, besides thinking the Beatles are the world’s main pop-rock band, I don’t share a lot of things in common with the vast majority. I finally belonged! Still, because of it, suddenly anyone started having as much of an opportunity as yourself to reach anyone else, to be “heard”. Meaning, in this BS competitive world we live in, the rule to actually get anywhere became to “stand out from the crowd”. Probably one of the concepts I hate the most in our history. Not that I don’t think I’m “unique enough” to pull it off eventually — when you’re writing a journal about becoming a writer you’re pretty much saying you’re the kinda guy who allows his Ego to take control from time to time — but telling anyone to “stand out from the crowd” is about as effective as asking someone to “stop being so anxious”; or saying “yes, your ex will be there but don’t worry about her.” Let’s get this straight, determining the most obvious main cause of one’s problem DOES NOT mean you’re doing absolutely anything for that person. You’re just a talking placebo. The whole point of writing this crap was to advertise myself as a non-member of the crowd. And, obviously, that’s not enough since writing a personal journal on our career search is not exactly breaking ground stuff. So, it’s all about bothering people through different portals and all that effective stuff you know and keep avoiding. Which is the fucking equivalent of talking on the phone on the internet!!! You know why this is the 100th time I write this down here — and we’re all hoping this is the week I FINALLY take this approach courageously enough to actually do something? Because I’m hoping this repetitiveness can better display to my anxious chicken self here that either we start doing something else or this becomes the blog of some crazy dude that actually thought something would happen if he just kept bitching exclusively to his own self daily… Day 239, Charlie. I can’t think of something I have not written here before, time to shake things up.",2017
Nobody saw it coming,"One minute I was sitting in class, reading allowed from a textbook. The next second, it was like my throat had swollen shut; I couldn’t breathe. I knew I had to get out of there. Mid paragraph, I flung the book closed and rushed up out of my seat, rocketing past my peers towards the door. I collapsed in the hallway. Being there, on my hands and knees gasping for air was not my finest moment. People walked by, watching me, eyeballs bulging out of my head, kinda looking like a fish out of water. Their stares, as you might imagine, didn’t help, but only made it worse. Finally, I got myself on to my back, and focused on counting ceiling tiles. My arms were tingling. My head was spinning. I was having a panic attack. After about five minutes, I slowly felt myself coming back out of it. The hazy fog began clearing from my vision. I was getting feeling back into my fingers, which had gone cold because all the blood was rushing to my head. I began to catch my breath. I was dripping with sweat, which left pit stains on my new shirt. My face glistened. I sat a while longer in the hallway taking it all in. When I finally was able to regain my strength, I headed back to the classroom to get my things; class had long since ended. When I walked in, the professor was there waiting for me, a warm smile on his face. “I knew you would come back” he said, “just figured I’d watch this for you.” I thanked him, and began to walk out, trying to avoid any further conversation. He cut me off, standing in the doorway. He shut the door, and sat down on top of the nearest desk. “What’s up?” he asked, a knowing look of sympathy in his eyes. “It’s nothing, I’m fine.” I replied, even though that was a lie. “Morgan, I know you and I just recently met, but you can talk to me. I understand all too well what you are going through. I’ve seen it in my wife.” “What?” I asked, confused as to why he continued to push me despite my attempts to politely end the conversation; I was embarrassed and ashamed to have interrupted his class the way I did. “My wife,” he repeated, “she has a panic disorder.” “How did you, why did…” I trailed off, shocked that he had mentioned this bit of his personal life to me. “I knew. The way you rushed out like that. It isn’t like you. But I understand. I have held my wife during many panic attacks while she gasped for breath and cried in my arms. It’s okay, Miss Frank. It’s not your fault. You don’t have to be ashamed.” he said, ending with, “Now, take care of yourself, alright. See you Thursday.” With that, we both walked out. While he may not have realized it, this professor’s small act of humility really had a positive impact on the rest of my day. During a panic attack, I have medication that I can take to shorten the duration, and help ward off subsequent attacks. It does it’s job, but sometimes too well. The rest of the day I go into this depressed funk where I’m basically an emotionless blob. Hearing something encouraging from a superior really helped keep my spirits up as I was laying there in bed later that day and replaying all of the day’s events. “What could have caused it? What can I do to prevent this the next time? Did I react appropriately? Did I interrupt class?” these kinds of things spun around in my head as I tried to make sense of all of it. It was nice knowing that not only did the professor understand me, he was empathetic to my situation. I found comfort in feeling like he accepted me, as myself, despite this panic disorder, and that it wouldn’t get in the way of how he treated me in an academic situation. It felt good to know that he still viewed me as a human being, and that this panic attack didn’t get in the way of a healthy student-teacher relationship. While I’m not saying any other professor or superior has ever judged me or treated my differently, the fact that he went out of his way to empathize with my situation put my worrying mind at ease. While I hope that no similar event should occur to that which happened today, I find that because my professor is so accepting, it’s one less thing I have to worry about. Acceptance is something that a person with mental illness searches for, and knowing that at least in that one little corner of my life, in that one class, someone is accepting of me, it’s a good feeling.",2017
How to Deal with Anxiety Attacks,"*If you’re having an anxiety attack right now and need instant tips to calm yourself down, scroll down to ‘Overcoming and Controlling an Anxiety Attack — Naturally’* Do you know what to do in an anxiety attack? If you’ve experienced one yourself, you know that when it comes down to it, in all truth there’s no real way to stop an anxiety attack. Luckily, there are ways to manage and control them attacks as they happen. While I can’t tell you how to prevent an anxiety attack (that’s a topic for another post!), dealing with it as it happens is very manageable and possible — and all it takes is a bit of practice! Remember, everything I’m telling you is from my own experiences — so if this works for me, it can definitely work for you too. Let’s say you’re having an anxiety attack right now (or you’re trying to help someone calm down from an anxiety attack). The situation is tense, you can’t think straight. It’s difficult to breathe. The panic is increasing, and you have no idea what to do. Your vision is fading in and out. You feel like you’re going to die. You’re helpless, and noone can help you, even if they’re trying. If this sounds familiar to you, there are a couple of things you need to know. This may sound harsh, but hear me out: There are no cures for anxiety attacks. It’s true. Anxiety attacks can only be prevented, but not cured. Even if you choose to use medication to relieve an anxiety attack, you are teaching yourself to rely on that, rather than deal with the problem itself, and therefore, have fewer in the long run. Therefore, it’s way better to know how to manage anxiety attacks, if and when they do happen. Another important thing: Don’t fight it. Take it from my experience: the more you struggle against it, the worse it’s going to get. Example: if you feel your whole body shaking, and try to stop it rather than let it flow, the shaking is only going to get worse. I’ve been there and done that — all while I was trapped on a plane. Long story short: do not fight the anxiety attack. Luckily, knowing how to control an anxiety attack naturally will help you ‘the next time’. And that’s where I step in. Are you ready? This is how you handle an anxiety attack, and teach it who’s boss. Do these in any order, if you need, and as many times as you feel you need to. Remember- don’t fight it. Ride that anxiety attack wave. Can’t catch a breath? Breathe in through your nose to the count of 4. Hold it for the count of 3. Breathe out for the count of 4. Repeat until you’ve manage to control your anxiety attack. Watch this video: Breathe in as the shape unfolds, hold and then breathe out as it folds back in: Distract yourself. If you’re with someone, tell them about your day, or your life, or that weird dream you had a few days ago. If you’re by yourself — notice and tell yourself (say it loud, who cares what other people think?): I used to carry water everywhere for this reason, but it’s always a good idea to stay hydrated as part of a clean, healthy lifestyle. Why sipping water, you ask? Well, your throat can’t breathe AND swallow at the same time. By sipping water, you’re forcing yourself to take a breath afterwards. Plus, sipping water is a very therapeutic activity. And, if you’re crying or losing bodily fluids, you need to restore those ASAP. because why make yourself feel worse than you already do? The same as the above. Singing forces you to regulate your breathing, and also distracts you. So finally you have an excuse to sing that catchy song that’s been in your head all day long. Get singing — out loud is best, so you’ll be inhaling and exhaling at the same time. For a similar reason to the above — this will help you distract yourself. Listening to music is an instant mood changer, and, with the right song, gives you happy memories. Meaning, you get to focus on the memory related to the music, and practising great anxiety attack management at the same time! I don’t know about you, but when I’m having an anxiety attack, it feels like everything is going to burst out of body all at once. And, if I’m in a public place, I don’t want to embarrass myself. Having said that, the feeling of relief once everything that needs to come out has gone…helps. It definitely makes stopping an anxiety attack easier, let me tell you. So, if you feel the need, find a toilet. Do what you need to do. We’re all human, and you’ll be glad you did it afterwards (and feel a bit better!). Remember, anxiety attacks are usually our mind’s silly response to a feeling or symptom. If you can relieve that feeling or symptom, you’re already winning. The best method of distraction there is, and it will make you feel like someone is partly in this with you. One of the worst things about having anxiety attacks is feeling like you’re all alone. So, make a new friend on the bus, or train, or call an old friend from somewhere quiet while you ride it out. Either way, sharing is caring. This one is my favorite and my number 1 tip to stop an anxiety attack. Go for a walk. If you’re too weak to walk, jump as many times as you can. You know why? It’s mostly for distraction. There’s a lot of adrenalin pumping through your veins during anxiety attacks, and walking/jumping gets rid of it, and quickly. But the best thing about walking or jumping? It regulates your breathing and clears your mind. Think about it — if you’re walking fast or jumping, eventually you’re going to have to breathe. So there’s no better time to do it. It’ll help your body stop shaking, at the very least. So give it a go! I really hope this has helped you, whether you are looking for ways to calm anxiety attacks, or if you’re looking for how to deal with someone having an anxiety attack. Please let me know if this has helped you in the comments — and remember — sharing is caring, but in this case it could also help out someone else out — so please share, share, share to your social groups!

What are the most common addiction symptoms of Xanax?,"Xanax involves a high dependency rate, and recent data suggests that over 10% of Xanax consumers have now become addicted to Xanax knowingly or unknowingly. Xanax is known for its short half-life. Simply put, it goes in and out of the body extremely fast. This trait allows the drug to cause more emotional and physical dependency as compared to the other drugs of this category.The only foolproof way of knowing whether someone is addicted to Xanax is to check their tolerance levels to the drug and if there are withdrawal signs if the intake of Xanax is stopped. Symptomatic signs of Xanax Addiction Xanax is advised to be taken only for a short period of time due to its high dependency rate as compared to other benzodiazepines. The drug is so addictive that some patients have complained of withdrawal even during the prescription duration. Being so high on dependency, it should be monitored carefully. The most common symptoms of withdrawal from Xanax are: · Headache · Aggression · Seizures · Light and Noise Sensitivity · Loss in sex drive · Lack of Coordination · Insomnia · Blurred Vision · Anxiety · Depression · Confusion · Slurred Speech · Excessive Sweating · Vomiting · Uncontrollable Shaking · Muscle Pain · Nausea · Dry Mouth One can expect these symptoms from as soon as a few hours after giving up the treatment to even two years post giving up of the treatment. Other symptoms include panic attacks and insomnia on quitting the treatment. Moreover, the rebound effects can bring forth pre-existent psychological disorders to surface. Although the rebound systems lose intensity in about a week of quitting the treatment, special symptomatic treatment is still required to curb the underlying disorders. However, people who have developed a very high tolerance for the drug can even exhibit more severe symptoms like the following · Uncontrolled muscle movements · Hallucinations · Suicidality · Hyperactivity · Chest pain · Seizures · Hostility · Thoughts of harming oneself When do the symptoms occur? *Initial 12 hours -Rebound Anxiety -Rebound Irritability *1–4 Days -All the symptoms are at their peak. *5–14 Days -Anxiety and insomnia may still be present. -Symptoms lose their intensity. *After 15 Days -Mild symptoms Xanax is one of the most commonly abused drug. Since the tolerance can be built to a very high level, those who have a high tolerance can consume extraordinarily large amount of Xanax. It has been reported by the media the prior to his death, he was consuming a whopping 40 Xanax a night! That in itself tells us about its tolerance and the intensity of withdrawal. Thus, always choose to buy Xanax legally online. To make matters worse, Xanax addicts become so tolerant to the drug that they may not even reflect any signs of being high. However, the other symptoms cannot be hidden. If you notice any of these symptoms in any Xanax consumer, you need to get him to a doctor immediately. Unnoticed Xanax addiction is not only harmful to the patient himself but he can be dangerous to others also as it affects the rational thinking of the person. A medical detox is necessary before going to a rehabilitation facility. Not only are the symptoms to be treated, but the tolerance levels in the body need to be carefully managed by experienced professionals.",2017
Why You Should See a Therapist in Your 20s,"Guess what: the twenties are actually one of the hardest decades of our lives. Surprising, right? We think the years between college and marriage are supposed to be carefree and easy, as we’ve got our youth, freedom, and few commitments. We’ve got tons of room to experiement and our whole lives ahead of us — so what could possibly be wrong? But ask any millennial and we’ll tell you: the period of “emerging adulthood” is NOT all fun and games. Quite the contrary: this decade often brings angst, fear, uncertainty, and instability. Sound familiar? As a millennial psychotherapist, I see twenty-somethings in my office all the time who are struggling: to find healthy relationships, to move forward in their careers, to develop adult relationships with their siblings and parents, and to keep up with their expectations of where they’re “supposed to be” by this time in their life. If any of this sounds familiar to you, allow me to pitch an old-fashioned solution to your woes: therapy. Though therapy gets a bad rap as stale, backward-looking, and fuddy-duddy, there is simply no better way to dig deep, figure out your sh*t, and find strength and clarity. Working with a trained and licensed mental health professional will enable you to develop self-awareness, move past your anxiety and depression, and develop practical strategies for actualizing your hopes and dreams. In fact, in my professional opinion, the twenties are actually the best time to see a therapist. I could give you a million reasons why, but here are just a few: Therapy is one of the best investments you can make in your twenties, because you’ve got all the time and space you need to work through your issues once and for all. So, millennials: run, don’t walk, to find a therapist — a trained, licensed, vetted mental health professional — who can help you use the uncertainty and confusion you’re feeling right now as a the opportunity of a lifetime: to become stronger, clearer, more confident, and more resilient. Basically, the best possible version of you. And let me know how it goes: hello@renastaubfisher.com.",2017
Facing Your Anxiety Tiger,"In our attempts to control our exposure to unwanted or unpleasant emotions we may find ourselves engaging in behaviors that actually pull us further from the life we want to be leading. For example, maybe you are someone with a fair amount (or a lot) of social anxiety. But you are also someone who values relationships. If you cope with the discomfort you feel when facing social interactions by avoiding them, you are likely engaging in a short term strategy that could lead to a long-term consequence that is painful for you…social isolation. In other words, it may “feel good” not to face that anxiety in the moment, but in the long-term you are far away from having a life full of rich relationships that you value. When trying to relate to your sense of vulnerability or anxiety in a different way, it can be helpful to think of your desire to avoid it as someone living with a hungry baby tiger. Although the tiger is just a baby, he is scary enough, and you think he might bite you. So you go to the fridge to get some meat for him so he won’t eat you. And, sure enough, throwing him some meat shuts him up while he’s eating the meat, and he leaves you alone for a while. But he also grows just a little bigger. So, the next time he’s hungry, he’s just a little bigger and a little more scary, and you go to the fridge to throw him some more meat. Again, you feed him to keep him at bay. The problem is that the more you feed him, the bigger he gets, and the more frightened you feel. Now eventually that little tiger is a big tiger, and he scares you more than ever. So you keep going back to the fridge to get more meat, feeding and feeding him, and hoping that one day he will leave you alone. Yet the tiger doesn’t leave — he just gets louder and more scary and hungry. And then one day you walk to the fridge, you open the door, and the fridge is empty. At this point, there is nothing left to feed the tiger . . . Nothing? . . . Except you! Are you aware of avoiding anxiety (feeding the tiger) with the hope that it will just go away? Do you engage in behaviors to avoid negative feelings that actually are against your goals and values, but feel good in the short-term? Consider examples of how you have fed your own anxiety monsters. Does your experience tell you that feeding them makes them leave you alone? Is there anything that indicates that this is going to happen? Attempting to control your exposure to negative feelings and mood states can significant reduce your ability to engage with the world around you because many times doing what is important or what matters in life is difficult. Change and growth often comes along with a sense of vulnerability or fear/anxiety. Consider letting yourself “have” your feelings and see if you can see the value in sitting with them, approaching them, understanding them…you might be surprised and that baby tiger may not get so out of control.

The Silent Anxiety Beneath Makeup and an Expensive Dress,"A friend was getting married, and this was the event on everyone’s lips for weeks: she went to the same school that I did; so we had mutual friends that were going to be there- she’d even invited ex-teachers. I was excited and had been looking forward to the wedding: I chose my dress; called my sister for makeup tips; borrowed a lipstick that matched and googled hairstyles that would suit the look. On the day, however, things didn’t really go as planned. I was running late. I don’t remember the exact details of why I was late and they remain an ever elusive blur, but I remember checking my watch while getting my hair done. I had ten minutes to finish getting ready, and I wasn’t even halfway there. My dress lay unironed on my bed, makeup products strewn across it haphazardly. It would take me at least forty minutes to get ready, which would mean I would be half an hour late. Late. I checked my watch again, smiling nervously at my hairdresser. My mind raced. How did this happen? I counted minutes, backtracking the events of my day, searching for the mistake. Why did this always happen to me? I began feeling lightheaded, but brushed it off. I was probably just hungry- low blood sugar, that’s what it was. I raced out of the hairdresser’s and home to put on my dress, zipping it up with shaky hands. They began to get clammy, and I wiped them on my dress. It must be the heat, it’s just hot in here, I thought to myself. I put on my makeup with great difficulty, the tremors spreading up my arms making the meticulous work of drawing on eyeliner a challenge. I did it nevertheless, checking my watch every few minutes. I was already late, but each time I watched the minute hand move, my heart hammered even harder in my chest. Forty minutes late. What would people think? I strapped on my heels. Forty three. My Mum was driving me there, and she wasn’t ready yet. Forty four. I knocked on her room door, reminding her for the tenth time, that we were late. Finally, we were in the car. Fifty nine. We reached the venue. Sixty eight. By the time we had reached, my Mum and I had gotten into an argument about why we were late, and whether she could have gotten ready sooner. I felt faint and dizzy. Must be the low blood sugar, I thought. I was over an hour late, and hadn’t eaten yet. I stumbled out of the car and slipped into the ladies’ room, smoothing out my curls and touching up my lipstick. My heart was racing so fast, it felt like a robotic hum in my chest. Must be the excitement and the stress all rolled up into one, I thought. I walked into the reception hall, spotting a table of friends and acquaintances sitting together. One of them waved, and I walked over briskly, smiling and waving back. I said hello, my voice a pitch higher than usual. I babbled on about how crazy my day had been, how lovely everyone looked and how beautiful the venue was. I bent down to hug one of the seated friends, gripping the back of her chair as I felt my knees weaken. My knuckles turned white. She grinned and told the girl next to her how characteristic it was of me to be “bubbly, excited and full of energy”. I was full of energy alright. Nervous energy. I stumbled around the room meeting people and making small talk, feeling like an untethered balloon. I couldn’t sit still, or stand in one place for more than a few seconds. The lights were bright. I looked at my watch. Seventy five. I felt disoriented and suddenly very very hot. Why was I still counting? It struck me that I had a plate of food in front of me, and I hadn’t eaten a bite yet. I didn’t remember being served, or what I chose. I blinked, confused. Eighty. I suddenly felt cold. I held a shaking fork up to my lips, and felt it drop. Months later, I looked back and realised that I was having a panic attack at that wedding. I didn’t have ‘typical’ symptoms: I wasn’t having chest pains or feeling faint. I didn’t have difficulty breathing, and I didn’t feel like I was dying. I did, however, ignore the irrational but very real fear of being late that pulsated through my system. According to my anxiety, being late meant I had no respect for others’ time: that I was selfish and disorganised; and therefore worthless. Being late in itself did not make me anxious, but knowing that I couldn’t stop it, couldn’t control it and couldn’t do anything to be on time past a certain point made me feel unsafe and out of control. I couldn’t understand how I felt, so I told myself it was hunger, low blood sugar, excitement. Nobody else seemed outwardly perturbed or distressed, so I mirrored their calm and tried to hide it. People who met me told me how lovely I looked and how nice it was to see me. I laughed and talked so they wouldn’t see the turbulent emotions I felt inside. To others, I looked excited and eager to mingle. Sociable, chatty. I had on a fancy dress and expensive shoes. They didn’t see the shaking hands, the sweaty palms, the weak knees. They couldn’t see the disorientation hidden by fake smiles and small talk. They couldn’t hear my racing heart and ragged breaths or the battle I was fighting with my thoughts. On the outside I looked like I was enjoying myself. On the inside, my mind was spinning out of control. I buzzed around the room, exuding nervous energy people mistook for confidence. Even after I saw others arrive after me, and realised that being late wasn’t the end of the world, coming down from the build up of those feelings was like being wound up tightly in a long piece of fabric, then pulling on a loose end and watching myself unravel. That evening I was ashamed of what I was feeling and how my body was reacting. I tried to hide it, not just from others but from myself. How could I panic over something so trivial as being late to a wedding? I felt the fear, dread and physical sensations that went with the anxiety, and yet I refused to accept it, burying the idea deep in the recesses of my mind. The more I tried to suppress it and rationalise it, the stronger it got. I learned later that the only way to deal with it is first to acknowledge it and allow myself to feel it without judgement. To say ‘Oh hello anxiety, there you are’ and simply notice that it’s there as a response to what my mind perceives as a dangerous situation. If I told any of the people at the wedding reception that day that I was having a panic attack, they would probably be surprised. In fact, if I told my close friends that I struggle with anxiety, they might have a similar reaction. I’m confident and outgoing: I put on makeup, dress well, socialise and have a good time, yet I struggle with anxiety. How many other people are hiding their mental struggles- how many well dressed, put together, high functioning people do we look at as attractive or successful because we can’t see them struggle? These struggles manifest themselves differently in everyone- often silent and hidden behind smiles and text message emojis, but we all struggle, even those of us that manage to look like we don’t beneath the makeup and clothes. Hiding those feelings and judging ourselves for having them is what gives them power over us and stops us from realising that they don’t define us. This piece was my way of being honest about a silent struggle so that I can strip away the shame and know that I am not my anxiety.",2017
Neurofeedback for Anxiety — A Case Study,"Elizabeth came to our NYC Neurofeedback Clinic after having tried many methods to address her Obsessive Compulsive and Post Traumatic Stress Disorders. She wanted relief from feeling anxious, like she was under attack. She also reported poor sleep and at times feeling emotional paralyzed and unable to move forward in her life. “After only seven sessions, neurofeedback has literally changed my life. As someone with a history of PTSD, severe OCD, and social anxiety disorder, suffice it to say that I had been struggling with crippling anxiety for a long time. Before I started with neurofeedback training I was completely dependent on medications such as Zoloft and Xanax to control the frequent panic attacks and other debilitating effects of my high anxiety level. Now, I’m becoming less and less relient on my medication with each passing week, and I haven’t had a panic attack in two months! I’m sleeping better, no longer plagued by intrusive thoughts, and the constant state of exhaustion I was in before has faded away. Overall, I’m feeling much more energized, happier and healthier than I have in years. I would highly recommend neurofeedback to anyone struggling to control the effects of anxiety in their lives.” – Elizabeth, NYC Here’s a screenshot of a before and after a neurofeedback session with Elizabeth: Notice the large drop in divergence numbers from before the training session to after. This is a sign that the brain is working hard to shift into regulation — calm alert and not experiencing danger. The system we use for rent and at our clinics, is called NeurOptimal Neurofeedback by Zengar. It works by training the brain to use the present moment to decide what to do next, rather than old, often maladaptive patterns — like that route to the bakery. It does this by triggering what’s called the orienting response, which is the brain’s ability to sense change in the environment and take in new information about what is different. Although NeurOptimal neurofeedback does not treat specific conditions, specific symptoms are alleviated because you are improving the overall functioning of the central nervous system. Learn more about the benefits of neurofeedback here. Study results of 1.2 million neurofeedback sessions indicate significant improvement was seen after 11–20 therapy sessions. Neurofeedback patients, on average, train for 15–25 therapy sessions. Results vary, and on rare occasions, minimal results are seen. Clients with multiple issues sometimes train up to 30 times with occasional “tune up” sessions thereafter. Want to learn more about Neurofeedback? See also, What happens in a session?",2017

Swapping My Anxiety for Creativity.,"I know that I am not alone when stating that anxiety absolutely sucks! For those who suffer from it, you know the horrible burden it is on your day to day life. Anxiety for me is like drowning in a pool of make believe worry. My anxiety is triggered by my mind making up fake problems; I am constantly imagining outrageous “what if” scenarios. Let’s just say, I do not do well with uncertainty. I don’t remember a moment in my life where I did not deal with this burden. Within the last couple of years, I have noticed though that it has amplified. I have sat down numerous times and have tried to analyze why this is so. After careful deliberation, I think I have found the catalyst! BOREDOM! We all know what it’s like to fall into the day to day wavelength of adult life; work, gym, sleep, repeat. Of course, there is the weekend (the brief lapse in the mundane) but we all know that’s not enough. What boredom does is give my mind time to make up these ridiculous scenarios. Over the last month, I have clumsily tripped over a way to relieve my anxiety. I have noticed that when I am creating something whether it be writing or posting looks on my fashion page, my anxiety seems to at least for those moments cease to exist. The best part about it is that it’s something that you could put into place right now. The moment I realized that I could escape this burden by doing things outside of my normal day to day, I took off running! I have dedicated more and more time to making ideas come to fruition. Anything, that in the past I may have hesitated on, I have acted upon. I no longer sit around and think things through I now take action right on the spot. The relief I get from writing this right now is insurmountable. I am hoping to encourage people that are dealing with anxiety to flex their creative muscles, to be able to break free from the hold of anxiety. I truly believe you need to shake things up a bit and act on something that you truly want to do. If you want to dance, write, play an instrument, draw whatever sparks an interest in you just act on it! I at no point think that any of my creative endeavors are going to make me any money; I do them simply for relief. The value in breaking your mind out of the auto-pilot it goes into after some time is priceless. I find that doing this has helped me at least for brief moments of my day escape anxiety. I hope that some of you could find comfort by doing the same. I will not lie to you and tell you that I no longer suffer from anxiety because it’s still a daily battle. I will tell you that you could use creativity in whatever form you deem fit to combat it! If this was article was helpful, press the ❤️ below to help others read it too.

Embrace Authenticity: How to Break Free from the Tyranny of Positivity,"The incessant focus on ‘just be positive’ actually undermines our resilience Susan David is the author of Emotional Agility, a leading psychologist at Harvard Medical School, and the co-founder and co-director of the Institute of Coaching at McLean Hospital. She recently joined Maria Shriver — award-winning journalist, bestselling author of six books, and former First Lady of California — for a conversation on why relentless positivity doesn’t lead to happiness, and how being emotionally honest can help us connect with our values and gain resilience. Maria: You are a counter voice to so many people telling us, “Be positive, be happy, have a great mood, and everything will be fine.” Susan: From a very young age, I became interested in this central question: what does it take internally in the way we deal with our thoughts, emotions, and stories, to help us thrive in the world? I’m a psychologist at Harvard Medical School. The broader research [shows] that this incessant focus on “just be positive” actually undermines our resilience. Maria: Telling people, “Just be happy. What’s wrong with you? Have a good attitude.” That actually hurts. Susan: It does, and I had my own experience with this when I was 15 years old. My father was diagnosed with terminal cancer, and I had this group of people coming to me and saying, “Just be positive. Everything will be okay.” It wasn’t okay. My father was dying, and then dead. I engaged in a relationship with this amazing teacher who instead of saying, “Just be positive,” she showed up to me. She was an English teacher, and she invited me to explore in a journal what I was going through. What I realized afterwards was that “just be positive” didn’t help me. What did help was engaging with myself in a way that was honest. A friend of mine who recently died of stage four breast cancer described this focus on being happy all the time as the tyranny of positivity. She said, “If it was just a case of being positive, the friends in my stage four breast cancer support group would be alive today, because they were the most positive people you met. By telling us to just be and think positive, it makes us feel culpable in our own death, that somehow we weren’t positive enough. We couldn’t think ourselves out of the situation. It stops me from being authentic with myself, with my experience, and being able to be present with the people that I love.” Maria: How do we get unstuck? How do we be authentic with ourselves, and if we encounter someone today who says, “I’m having a really bad day?” I would never dare to say to my mother, “I’m having a bad day. I’m struggling.” She used to always say, “I don’t want to hear a yip out of you. Get going.” I didn’t feel like I grew up in a home where I had permission to complain. I carried that on a little bit, even to my own children. I’ve tried to open a space for them to complain, but where’s the balance? Susan: First, people who focus on being happy actually, over time, become less happy. To be clear, I’m not anti-happiness. It’s more that our happiness comes not as a goal, but as a byproduct of engaging in honesty with ourselves. medium.com Maria: How do we do that? Susan: One of the first things is showing up. Instead of trying to push our emotions aside or trying to put on a happy face — what I call bottling and brooding — instead, literally drop any struggle that you have within yourself by ending the battle. Not saying to yourself, “I’m unhappy, but I shouldn’t be unhappy.” Or, “I’m miserable in my job, but at least I’ve got a job.” Really just open up to the fact that we have a full range of emotions. These emotions have helped us and evolved to enable us to position ourselves effectively in the world. Maria: You have a couple other steps. What are they? “Our difficult emotions point to the things that we value.” Susan: One is stepping out of our emotions. It’s important to recognize that our emotions contain data. I’ve never met a mother who’s feeling guilty about her parenting who, at some level, isn’t wanting to be present and connected with her children. Our difficult emotions [point] to the things that we value. Instead of struggling with whether we should or shouldn’t feel something, it’s important for us to say, “What is the function of this emotion? What is the value? What is this emotion trying to tell me?” Within that, it’s important for us to recognize that our emotions are data, not directions. Because you feel guilty doesn’t mean you need to feel guilty. Because you feel angry doesn’t mean you need to attack the people that you’re angry with. We can create space, the “stepping out” part. Maria: Your theory is that if we get to know ourselves, if we slow down enough, figure out what is really going on, give ourselves space to complain, to write — that, in turn, allows you to get unstuck and be stronger, hence happier? Susan: Absolutely. One of the most beautiful embodiments of emotional agility comes from Viktor Frankl, who survived the Nazi death camps. The idea that’s attributed to him is this: “between stimulus and response there is a space, and in that space is our power to choose, and it’s in that choice that comes our growth and freedom.” So often, we get hooked by our emotions and thoughts. We treat them as fact, so there’s no space between the stimulus and response. When you say something like, “I am stressed,” you are identifying all of you with being stressed. I talk about very practical strategies. [Say,] “I’m noticing that I’m feeling angry,” or “I’m noticing that I’m feeling stressed.” Instead of being one and the same as stress, you are recognizing that you’re experiencing an emotion. One thing which is so powerful is to hear the heartbeat of our own why. We live in a world where everyone is telling us what to think, how to look, how to feel. There’s fascinating research showing that we are subject to social contagion, where we start subtly picking up the behaviors of others. We go into an elevator, everyone’s looking at their phones, so we take out ours. If you’re on an airplane, if your seat partner buys candy, even if you don’t know that person, you are 30% more likely to buy candy. Maria: I saw that last night. I was on the plane. The guy next to me got pretzels and peanuts, and I was like, “Maybe I should have some of those. They really smell good.” Then you’re having a whole debate with yourself. I really didn’t want them, but it’s social contagion. Susan: Yet, if we start to hear the heartbeat of our own why — who I want to be in the situation, in this discussion, in this world — it actually protects us from social contagion. “We often use just three or four emotions to describe what we’re feeling, and yet the research shows that when we use more differentiated language about our emotions, it actually helps us over time to become more resilient.” Maria: One of the things I really liked that you’re talking about is to expand your emotional vocabulary. We all use “I’m mad,” “I’m stressed.” But particularly if you’re a parent, instead of saying to your kids, “I can’t talk to you now, I’m stressed,” actually lay out all of these different emotions — what stress actually means. Maybe you’re scared. Maybe you’re afraid. Maybe you failed at the office. Use other words. Susan: This is a really critical skill. We often use just three or four emotions to describe what we’re feeling, and yet the research shows that when we use more differentiated language about our emotions, and when we help our children to do the same, it actually helps us over time to become more resilient. How do we engage, in practical ways, with ourselves in a way that is curious and compassionate? Label our emotions effectively, and come to a point where we are able to say, “This is the way that I want to be in the situation.” Values are often thought of as these very abstract things, on walls in offices, but ultimately have little meaning. But actually every single day all of us have hundreds of opportunities to make choices that are towards or away from our values. If we can start recognizing that values are actually qualities of action rather than abstract things, it helps us to thrive. Maria: What’s important about agility and resilience is that everybody needs resilience to get through life, because no matter who you are, stuff happens. We hear a lot about how to raise resilient children, but what about adults who weren’t raised to express their emotions, to think about their values, to write? Who may struggle with depression, with that critical voice. Can they build resilience in their 20s, 30s, 40s, 50s, 60s? Susan: Absolutely, people can develop capability around these skills. Life’s beauty is inseparable from its fragility. We’re healthy until we’re not. We’re with the people we love until we aren’t. We nag our children to clean their rooms until one day we walk in and the child is off at college. So developing this capability is really important, and absolutely we are raised [with] display rules. Display rules are the implicit or sometimes even explicit rules that families have about which emotions are okay. “Go to your room when you’re angry, and come out when you’ve got a smile on your face,” or “we don’t do sadness here.” We carry these display rules into our lives, and this can lead to situations where we no longer trust our emotions or are open to what we experiencing. First, try to welcome your emotions. To not fight with them. They’re there for a reason, and that reason is to help us calibrate and position ourselves more effectively in the world. Maria: Also, to know yourself better. That doesn’t mean you’re a narcissist, selfish, or self-centered. Moving humanity forward starts with yourself. It starts at your own kitchen table. How you interact with other people. Do you know your neighbors? Do you get involved in your local community? What kind of parent are you? What kind of citizen are you? You don’t have to be running for office. In your opinion, how do you feel you’re moving humanity forward? What kind of society do you envision if everybody were to read this book? What would be the direct result? Susan: The first thing that I envision is a society in which we are more compassionate with ourselves as well as with others. The second thing that I would see is a society that isn’t driven by anger or sadness or any particular emotion, but rather that is driven by values. What I’m trying to do is help people to become more connected with themselves, and to recognize that so much of the change is not about making enormous changes. [It’s] tiny tweaks: the tiny tweak of “I love this person — but every time they come home from work I hardly get up from my computer to even say hello to them,” or “I want to be a present parent and yet I’m on my phone at the dinner table.” Make a small change. We can take a habit that we’ve already got and piggyback onto that habit in ways that are values-aligned. You put your keys into a particular drawer? Put your cell phone into the drawer, as well, so that you have a conversation with your child where you aren’t on the phone. How do we enter into a space that allows us to be more honest, more connected, and to make actual changes on the ground? The hope is that people can engage in that space where they are more compassionate, more connected with their values, and more able to bring their values to their everyday lives. Maria: Then that will make you happy. Susan: As a byproduct. Maria: You’re not shooting for happiness. You’re shooting to create a more conscious, caring, and compassionate community, country, and world; to get unstuck, embrace change, to be resilient, so that you can handle whatever life throws at you, being able to say, “This is hard. I don’t have to medicate it. I don’t have to drink it away. I can feel it. I can write it down. I can rip it up, and I can make it.” “It’s not about doing away with your fear, but recognizing your fear, your anger, and still choosing to walk in the direction of your values.” Susan: It’s so powerful, and that enables us to also do the same with our children, to allow them to create the space to feel jealousy or anger or whatever they feel. These same principals apply to them. By 2030 the World Health Organization predicts that depression — not cancer, not heart disease, not diabetes — will be the leading cause of disability globally. Our children are growing up in a world that is unprecedented in terms of its complexity, change, geopolitical tension, technology. Starting to cultivate these skills in ourselves as well as others is critical. How would you see yourself as being an architect of change in your own life? It might be at your dinner table, it might be out in the world, but that’s a core question to bring to the surface at this time in our country. Maria: Whatever you’re doing in your own life and in your own home does impact the world. What the world needs are people who are conscious, caring, compassionate, who see themselves as citizens, and believe that they’re here for some specific purpose and reason. To find that, you need to have an advanced emotional vocabulary. You need to slow down, and be aware of how susceptible you may be to this. Susan: Many people are feeling really troubled at the moment, and when we think about being fearful or angry, people tell us to control our fear, our anger, and do away with it. These emotions are normal, and help us to position ourselves effectively in the world. Courage is not an absence of fear. Courage is fear walking. It’s not about doing away with your fear, but recognizing your fear, your anger, and still choosing to walk in the direction of your values. This conversation originally appeared on Heleo.com.

THE FEEDBACK LOOP FROM HELL,"“The desire for more positive experience is itself a negative experience. And, paradoxically, the acceptance of one’s negative experience is itself a positive experience”. — Mark Manson You get anxious about confronting somebody in your life. That anxiety cripples you and you start wondering why you’re so anxious. Now you’re becoming anxious about being anxious. Oh no! Doubly anxious! Now you’re anxious about your anxiety, which is causing more anxiety.",2017
Words,Walk for miles along the banks of clear water sleep under the couch on the floor and climb trees and walls to meditate because I cannot write what I feel and I do not know why the words get stuck in my throat and my hand freezes because it is so very important that you know these things but there is no easy way for me to tell you and it tears me apart every day as my head mouths no in cowardice and I am unsure why or how to mediate the divide between what something in me wants to make real and what the worry in my mind says.,2017
Battlegrounds,"When I first wrote about having panic attacks, I vomited up this huge post of pain and sadness and frustration and ended it with, “my life as I knew it is now over”. I was distraught that this crippling monster had taken over my body and brain — in a completely uncharacteristic way; when I first told my mum about what happened to me, her response was, “Anxiety? Panic attacks? But you don’t give a fuck about anything!” This was in September 2015 and a year and a half down the line, that closing seems almost unnecessarily dramatic. I moved to two different countries, I came off the meds (even though Citalopram will always have a special place in my heart for saving my sanity and possibly life) and I haven’t had panic attacks since. There are times when I feel so anxious that it’s like a metal vice gripping me from the inside, my brain and chest and stomach, but I know now that it’s a psychological monster, not a pathological one, and remind myself to breathe and think of good things. When it’s something specific, dissecting it (sometimes in writing) often makes me think, “I am a moron for getting paranoid about it”. Having panic attacks made me take better care of myself; lack of sleep and a poor diet aren’t something to ignore anymore. Having panic attacks gave me better control of my brain; if you don’t train yourself to reign in your thoughts, you’re going to have a bad time. Having panic attacks, in a way, has been one of the greatest things that happened to me because it has taught me to fight bears. “I see life as like being attacked by a bear. You can run, you can pretend to be dead or you can make yourself bigger. So, if you’re my stature, you stand on a chair and bang a pan and scream and shout as if you’re going to attack the bear. This is my go-to strategy.” — Amy Poehler Life is full of bears and battles and I realise now that a lot of my life is going to be spent fighting; because I’m an anxious person, because I’m an immigrant, because I’m blonde, because I’m female. My own brain and other people are going to come at me and I’m going to have to keep overcoming them. And it’s going to be exhausting and frustrating at times but it’s the only way. Because the only other option is to curl up and never leave the house and I’m not ready to die just yet. So I guess that’s my advice to anyone who’s going through the same thing. Always keep fighting. Keep fighting like your life depends on it, even if it feels like you’re about to take your last breath — take it, and you’ll realise that the next one is a split second away, and that means you’ve won the battle. Make yourself big. You matter. Your physical self matters. Your emotions matter. You deserve to take up space in the world and be loved and appreciated. A year and a half ago I genuinely thought, and at times hoped, that I was going to die. Now I’m happier with myself than I’ve ever been before — I’ve accepted myself for who I am, quirks and all — and I’ve realised that nothing bad lasts for ever. You just have to grit your teeth and make yourself big and charge.",2017
In the beginning,"She’s crying, and I’m alone. The work day began hours ago. I watch the winter sun — blinding in its brightness but not at all warm — illuminate patches of dust on the nightstand, and i feel its indictment of me, of my morning. I know that after a certain point, I just won’t ever take my pajamas off. We have passed that point. When I contemplate the trip to the closet, the attempt to find a pair of pants that will fit around my still-soft thighs, hips, that will button without digging into my flesh, I feel only tired. The deep exhaustion of disappointment in my own body, once thriving and existing for my use and my pleasure. Now merely a liability, like a stubborn pet I have to feed and housebreak, because the family seems to like it. Where am I going anyway, today? The kitchen. Not nearly grand enough to require pants. She’s crying, and I’m tired. Pajama pants will have to do. I lift her from her crib, gently but without bothering to put that precautionary hand behind her head, as I did when she was smaller. I’ve learned very little over the past four months, but I do know that her head is not going to roll off, so I try to make that one less thing to worry about. It goes against my nature, a little, to let her be responsible for her own head. She does just fine with it, though, and she stops crying as I lift her. “Oh, good job!” I say to her. “Good job with your head!” Good job with your head? I am not sure what to do, now, standing here, holding her. Out the window to the east is the lake, which is sometimes indistinguishable from the sky, the two fused together in their steely indifference, but today it’s a deep blue, which some corner of my mind understands to be beautiful. “Still cold, though,” says the rest of my mind. The rest of me. This lake is not the lake of lazy lemonade summers, rope swings and wiry, bare-chested little boys, tall grass and tiny minnows to tickle the ankles, someone cooking hot dogs on a grill caked thick with remnants of communal merriment. This lake is a vast separation between me and everything else. My husband, who is at work on the other side. My home, where I grew up. My family, who do not care for the things my new neighbors do: chickens, hand-knit wool baby clothes, wooden toys instead of plastic. My job, where I wore pants. It’s funny, about the pants — it’s like a joke that all of the mothers make. Yoga pants, pajama pants, buttons and zippers. Putting on pants has become a badge of honor. No one really talks about shoes. When I walk down our wooden stairs carrying her, sometimes my stocking foot slips over the edge of one of the steps, and for one terrible moment, my stomach drops. (“Her head! I’ll drop her!” It is the most alive I’ll feel all day.) I look at her then. “Whew! We almost fell!” Or, if I’m feeling less genial, it’s something else, to the air: “Fuck these fucking stairs!” Anyway, the socks make me feel sloppy. Hair and dirt stick to them, and as the day progresses they begin to slide off my feet, loose in the toes, loose like everything else is now. The hours, the rules, my skin. I long for the clack clack clack of shoes. She’s crying, and I’m afraid. What if there’s an emergency, and I need to run outside in my socks? I’ll find my shoes later, while she naps. It’s too hard now, to hold her and look for my shoes, to bend and put them on. I could put her down while I tie them, but then she might cry, and then she might not stop. I remember when I was in fourth grade, my friend Leslie Davies — who took herself far too seriously, I thought — turned to look at me one afternoon as we lay in the grass, and said, “Did you know that when it gets very quiet, you can actually hear the air molecules bumping together? That’s what that hum is.” “It’s bugs,” I’d said. “Those are bugs.” But I hear the hum now. It seems almost as though it’s the sound of the dust motes colliding, in that callous, insistent sunlight. The sound of panic, of the suspended animation of a baby who is not crying. She’s not crying now, but she will. She will, if I move. I sit in the squeaky desk chair at our computer, trying to summon some creative spirit to propel me from this numbness — without moving. Without leaning forward to grab a pen or move the mouse. I watch the dust, in the humming, buzzing sunlight, and I tell myself that it is enough, just to sit. I do not need to shower, to find pants, to put on shoes, to write, because if I do, she will cry, and I will have lost my chance — to shower, to find pants, to put on shoes, to write. And what do I have to say anymore, anyway? She is sleeping, and I cannot move. I cannot breathe.",2017
Tips to Beat Social Anxiety During Holiday Shopping,"The holiday season is associated with a lot of joy, fun, feasting, outing and shopping. But it is secretly dreaded by some who loathe the very idea of going to crowded shopping places. Such people suffer from what is known as social anxiety disorder. Social anxiety disorder or social phobia is a type of anxiety disorder where the sufferer is paranoid of social situations. This extreme anxiety, which is always unreasonable, is a kind of self-consciousness, which is rooted in the fear of being closely monitored, judged and criticized by others. However, experts have some tips for such people who may be struggling due to their condition, deprived of the excitement and joy of interacting with others or shopping during the holiday season or for that matter participating in any social occasion. Here, we look at some of the tips: 1. Having a plan in place: Experts believe that having a plan in place can help people suffering from social anxiety. When it becomes unavoidable to relegate shopping to a later date, one should plan ahead such as where to go for shopping, the best suitable time, i.e., when the maximum crowd does not turn up and leave before it does. Advance planning can help dissipate a lot of internal anxiety. 2. Opting for online shopping: A lot of the actual fun of shopping during a festive season gets diluted in online shopping but for those who suffer from social anxiety, it is a big boon. When buying becomes indispensable during such a busy season, online shopping helps by doing away with the hassle of jostling in the crowd at shopping malls and marketplaces. 3. Choosing the right shopping center: When going out and shopping becomes unavoidable for any reason and doing so online is not an option, the best thing to do is to choose the right shopping mall or market. While the indoor malls are heavily crowded and it gets difficult to push through the crowd, an outside mall, on the other hand, sees lesser footfalls. Thus, they can be a better option for such shoppers who are petrified of moving around in crowded shopping areas. They also provide an opportunity to walk around in the open. 4. Taking somebody along: This is another pragmatic solution provided by experts to those who have a social anxiety problem. Instead of venturing out alone into a market which is already a place that triggers anxiety, taking along somebody with whom one feels comfortable is a reasonably good idea. It acts as a support system and helps thwart anxiety. It can also be comforting for the person afflicted with anxiety. 5. Reminding oneself of tips that help in calming: Experts recommend that people who suffer from anxiety develop handy techniques or tips to calm down. This will also help them overcome any tendencies to create anxiety within. Not only that such tips can be a convenient way to deal with anxiety while shopping in crowded places. Recovery road map Anxiety disorder is a common mental health problem which affects about 18.1 percent adults in the U.S. Although it is manageable, delaying the treatment could lead to deterioration of symptoms and the patient may end up facing greater hurdles during treatment. Timely treatment is the key to recovery.

Your First Meeting With a Therapist,"So you’ve done your research and have finally found a great therapist for you. The next step is to meet with the therapist and there is a certain level of anxiety associated with meeting a therapist for the first time. If you are completely new to therapy and counseling, a fear of the unknown is often to follow you from your house to their office. In order to counteract this sense of anxiety, it’s important to first realize that this anxiety is universally understood to most people who enter into therapy or counseling for the first time. What best alleviates the stress is knowing what to expect and being aware of the goals you have for entering into therapy in the first place. Maybe you’re worrying about the future, struggling with depression or battling anxiety, or maybe you’re just searching for some answers and insight into your life and how to make it better. Many people believe they shouldn’t enter into therapy because their situation is not dire enough, but it’s better to seek out help before treatment becomes an absolute necessity. Before going to your first session, it’s important to research the person and try to speak to them over the phone, if possible. Getting a feel for the person ahead of time will put you more at ease when the time comes to make your appointment. Realize before your first therapy or counseling session that the first meeting is just a time to become acquainted with the therapist and give them an idea of what the problem is. Every therapist is different but most are likely to be passive in that first meeting in order to get a feel for the issues and to just let you speak. Be straightforward with your therapist about what might cause you to sever this relationship. Any therapist would rather know that certain points of view about your situation are off offensive. Perhaps your spouse had cheated on you and your friends blamed you for the infidelity; let your therapist know this line of thinking made you angry and why. Any explanations and insight into your feelings and emotions will only help your therapist know you better and be able to come up with the best action plans for you. Before going to your first session, it’s imperative that you have a goal in mind of what you are hoping to gain from therapy. It could be something as simple as getting a different perspective of the issue at hand or to face the problem head on and get real advice into dealing with anxiety, disorder, or taking control of a mental illness. Go in prepared with at least what you hope to gain from your therapy or counseling sessions so the therapist can have a better idea of what you want out of it.",2017

5 ways to deal with email anxiety,"“It feels like…” I paused for a second, in search of the adequate words. And it clicked. I remembered how it feels. A few days earlier I talked to my friend from Spain about their custom of bull running. That’s how. “Can I tell you a story?” “Sure,” he said. “During the summer festivals in Spain, they have a tradition when several running bulls are let loose to run through the towns and villages. And people are running away from them. I know…crazy Spanish. I don’t get it either. Anyway. That is how it feels. When I receive an email, I feel as if the bull is released and I have to RUN.” This is how I’ve described an email anxiety to my counselor a few months ago. Bulls running. I have no idea where did this comparison come from, but I burst into a hysterical laughter. I felt as if I said too much. “Interesting. What is the emotion there?” he asked. I started thinking. Discomfort? Anger? Rage? No. “I know. It’s fear. Existential fear,” I said confidently. Existential fear? Seriously? It felt as if I am referring to a real bull running, not the process of receiving an email. It did not seem reasonable at all. But it felt so true. Emails triggered a fight-or-flight response in me. Which is the basic consequence of the most primitive fear. Existential fear. We analyzed this fear a bit. Fear of what? My inbox was like Pandora’s box. If I open it, who knows, many evils might pop out. But I’d better open it. And I’d better do it frequently. Because who knows who got pissed today and where somebody else thinks I should jump next. I felt as if the person who sent me an email is standing at my front door, having absolutely nothing to do, being blocked because I haven’t answered that email and waiting. Of course, this is not true. It is actually a completely unrealistic exaggeration. Here are the ideas on how to deal with email anxiety that helped me greatly: How does it feel? Do the same exercise as I did with the counselor. What is your scary story? Paint it as vividly as you can. Feel it in your body. What emotions are associated with it? Don’t worry if your story is ridiculous. Mine was, too. But once I looked into it and saw how crazy and unrealistic it is, I could let it go. Byron Katie gave an outstanding example: Imagine that you’re walking in the woods and you see the snake. You intermediately freak out, your heart starts beating like crazy, your palms sweat and all you want to do is run. But then you realize that the snake does not move and when you look once again, you figure that it’s not a snake but an old rope. If I ask you in that moment to get scared again, to forget that the “snake” is actually a rope, you won’t be able to. Because once you know the truth ( the snake is just a rope, there is nothing to be scared of), you cannot un-know it and go back to the old way of thinking. Emails (particularly work-related) can introduce a sense of urgency. Full inbox makes us uncomfortable and we want to do something about it. Plus, emails are a perfect busy-work that makes us feel productive when in fact, we’re just procrastinating on what’s really important (and difficult). All of these factors will make us dive into our inboxes and start to frantically declutter. Or, even worse, these tendencies will make us keep the email open for the whole day and deal with emails as they come. Which means we’ll be in a reactive, distracted mode of thinking all day long. In his book Originals, Adam Grant says that (good) procrastinators are actually more creative than the people who deal with everything right here, right now. I think the same goes for email responding. Too many times I have responded an email as quickly as I could, only to find out that I missed an important piece of information, or attachment (God bless those automatic attachment reminders), or that I did not fully understand what the other person asked me. It is so vital to give ourselves time. Sit, think, carefully craft your response and send it. I bet a huge portion of email anxiety is due to people frantically trying to send everything out as quickly as possible. (Alex Franzen has created THIS great guide for writing better emails.) Here is a big truth: The world won’t stop spinning and the birds will not fall from the sky. In other words, what we wish to present as urgency is usually not that urgent. We want to believe that we are doing something crucial to saving the planet, but let’s be honest, most of the time it’s not. We have created our own sense of urgency, our own little drama and now we’re anxious. Solution: let’s stop the insanity. Let’s see the things for what they really are. Email is the way of easy communication, not the omnipotent tool that will save the human kind. We teach people how to treat us. We are setting our own boundaries. It is simple, yet hard. We want to show up as good colleagues, friends, responsible business owners. But in our desire to be helpful, we often say ‘No’ to ourselves, to our work and our focus. And the anxiety creeps in. We don’t have to do things that way. The other day I brought a broken scale to the technician and he told me he will see if he can do anything about it. He got back to me a week later. I imagined that he would drop everything and examine my scale within the same day because that’s probably what I would do. That was an important lesson to me. And you know what? I did not get upset about it at all. I figured he probably has a lot of work and he’s doing things one by one. And I appreciated his effort much more. Although the rest of this post is about work related emails, I think it’s also important to think about the clutter in our inboxes with newsletters, updates, promotions and all that jazz. I would like to encourage you to massively unsubscribe. You haven’t opened last 10 newsletters from someone? Chances are you won’t open the following 10. Unsubscribe. Also, ditch the updates that Amazon, Ebay, Twitter, Facebook and all the other stores, sites and social networks are sending. Use services like Unroll.me, put all the remaining newsletters into it and receive 1 email per day. These actions may seem insignificant, but the truth is they can open much more of our mental space, otherwise blocked with emails. “Outer order contributes to inner calm,” said Gretchen Rubin and I couldn’t agree more. Your turn. Any tips on how to deal with email anxiety? Let me know in comments below.

14 Self Care Ideas For Better Mental Health,"By: Meg Zulch It’s so easy to neglect your mental health, so easy to prioritize work and productivity over all else. It’s because of this that self care can be categorized as extra or indulgent, and often gets neglected for “more important” things. However, self care drives home the idea that your physical and emotional health are most important, and crucial for the rest of the system to work properly. Because, let’s face it: when we do take the time to treat ourselves to a face mask or a meditation, we tend to feel more motivated at work and present in our relationships. For people living with mental illnesses like panic disorder, mood disorders and personality disorders, self care is absolutely essential to proper functioning. Because the truth is this: these coping skills we often write off as menial are actually incredibly productive and essential for certain folks to get through their days. However, the main critique on self care dialogues seems to mainly surround accessibility. Because usually folks don’t want to or simply can’t fork over money to indulge in a face mask or manicure, often because folks who struggle with mental illness have a harder time finding and keeping reasonably-paying jobs. So I’ve compiled some of my favorite self care methods that have helped me through depressive episodes, anxiety attacks, addiction relapses — and best of all, it didn’t cost me a dime! Hopefully, some or all of these can be helpful additions to your own toolbox. Whenever I’m in a bad place or can’t seem to sleep on a given night, ASMR videos have proven to be a lifesaver. For those who don’t know, these videos contain gentle speaking, clicking and tapping that trigger a euphoric and tingly feeling all over your body (sometimes you can get this reaction from ASMR triggers in your own environment). If you have anxiety, they’re very helpful to play in the background while you’re tidying up, as you’re falling asleep, and if you ever need a loving person speaking gently to you in a time of need. My favorite artists are SpringbokASMR, CosmicTingles, and albinwhisperland. I often find myself recommending meditation to folks with anxiety. However, if you’re anything like me, you might find meditation often turns out fruitless and even a little frustrating. Guided meditations have always been my jam, since the concept of “just sitting and clearing your mind” has always felt impossible to me. A Safe Space meditation is a sort of guided practice that is most effective when led by a therapist or compassionate friend, at least the first time you do it. Through visualization, you imagine what your “safe space” looks like: how it smells, feels, looks, sounds and tastes. After building this world for a few minutes (with or without guidance), you give it a short name so that you can conjure it whenever you need it. Mine is called “ocean bed,” a physics-defying warm bed at the bottom of the sea, complete with sunlight, sand, and sea green kelp plants. The idea is whenever you find you’re in a place of panic or disassociation or are in desperate need of some mental safety, you can close your eyes and immerse yourself in this world you built. It’s has been one of my most effective self care tools, and has gotten me through two public panic attacks. I’m a big fan of coloring, as I find it really helps me fill the time when I’m getting cravings for alcohol. Adult coloring books are expensive; and while I admit to having a few of my own, I’m also a big fan of printing out coloring pages from places like Rookie Mag and by artists like Ambar Del Moral (who created coloring pages specifically for Aloe) to work on in my free time. However, if you don’t have access to a printer, whip out some crayons, colored pencils and a piece of paper. Draw how you’re feeling. Draw what you look like when you’re at your strongest. Draw a timeline of your life, using one color for the positive events and another for the negative events, rating them based on how they impacted you on a scale of 1–10. Draw something that you feel evokes a positive emotion you want to embody. Besides getting you to a better place with your anxiety or sobriety, this creative time you carve out for yourself can help you process and express your emotions, challenging or positive. Sometimes, the best treat you can give yourself is some peace and quiet. Especially if you have an anxiety disorder or a severe mental illness like bipolar, overstimulation from your day can cause a panic attack or manic episode. It’s important that we treat our tired minds to what they’re asking for: rest. For me, this means curling up in a sunny spot of the house in a warm blanket. It would also be quiet so I can finally unravel my thoughts and sit in silence as I recupe from the day’s exhaustion. Burning candles, rubbing soothing essential oils on your wrists or downloading a free white noise app could also be great additions to your me time. Just kick back, relax, and forget about the world for a bit. If you struggle with nightmares or bad sleep in general, keeping a dream journal can be super helpful in processing some yucky feelings from the previous day you didn’t realize you had. When I have a disturbing dream, it often repeats itself or is followed up with a similarly upsetting dream. But I observed that once I committed to writing all my dreams down, as well as the feelings they evoked, my bad dreams lessened and lessened. If this isn’t for you or you don’t suffer from nightmares or terrors, consider keeping a journal to express your feelings and/or gratitude. When trying to find the right medication dose and combo, or when you’re struggling to understand the things you are feeling, it can be useful to write down your symptoms and track them based on dose, environment and events that may affect your mood. By getting to know yourself and your mental health better, you can care for yourself much more easily. And by keeping track of the evolution of your symptoms on certain drugs, you can help yourself get to the right medicine levels more quickly. Building a network of supports is perhaps the most important part of recovery and strong mental health. Chatting with friends who are understanding or who are going through similar things can be very comforting and enlightening. Tell your supports how they can help you (like bringing you to the doctor if you’re scared to go alone, or send text reminders to drink water whenever they think of it). Ask your friend how you can help them (like visiting when they’re depressed and in need of motivation to leave the house). Plan self care dates to color, do homemade face masks and watch a soothing movie together. It can make a big difference in your mental health when you have someone (or many someones) holding you accountable. One way that has really helped me in my own recovery is to honestly impart some of the details of my mental health and life across multiple social media platforms. I use these platforms to uplift myself while feeling pretty shitty about whatever I’m writing. Since I know that many folks with similar issues will be reading it, I always try to positively reframe and generate positivity in these posts. Though it can be difficult sometimes not to feel negative about how I struggle with my diagnoses, writing and reading these posts of mine give me renewed optimism and strength. In a world that is so horribly entrenched in Tr*mp and negativity, making a point of consuming and spreading positive news is very important for all of us. Make a point of reading at least 3 posi news pieces a day. Share it on social media. If you’re feeling daring, try reading 2 posi news stories for every negative one. This could help make you feel less overwhelmed about the world ending, and also repel you from reading so much negative news (since reading 2 nice stories for every Tr*mp-related article sounds like a lot for me based on how much Tr*mp media I’ve been consuming on the daily). Definitely stay informed but stay mindful of the news’ effect on you. Treating yourself to visiting and marveling at a beautiful place that gives you peace, whether that be a park, river or garden, is the perfect treat for any day you’ve got some free time to kill. My places of peace are churches (I love the smell of the incense and the nostalgia of the environment), parks, and animal shelters (I love to coo over all the dogs and cats available for adoption). I prefer going to these places solo because I feel there’s more magic in the experience without adding a social element. On days where I have no direction or motivation, I force myself to go to one of these places and take in the peaceful, therapeutic magic of the space. If you have Netflix or some other subscription streaming service, treat yourself to a day of TV or movie binging on your sick days regarding both mental and physical illness). Allow yourself that time to do nothing and get lost in an entirely different world. Sometimes, that’s just what we need. And if you don’t have a subscription service, find links to your favorite Miyazaki movies, pop out DVDs of your favorite show or catch a Project Runway marathon on TV. When I feel stuck in a rut, I try to find an activity or sensation that will snap me out of it or “change the frequency” so to speak. It can be a smell you like that perks you up or relaxes you (I carry around a small satchet of lavender in my purse, and I take whiffs from it when I’m feeling anxious). It can be a hot shower or a warm bath. It can be playing music you like to sing along to. Find what shifts you back into a good place when you’re struggling and stick to it. Find songs that help you focus if you’re feeling manic and having difficulty centering yourself. Or songs that help you relax when you’re feeling anxious and fragile. Or songs that help you get motivated to get up and go when you’re feeling depressed. Regardless of your specific emotional need, craft your playlists and use them wisely. Try to come up with a few positive affirmations to use as personal mantras when you’re most in need. I find “I’m safe, I’m loved, I’m resilient” to be especially helpful to me. You could also choose affirmations that help boost self esteem, motivate you to do well in your job search, or put you in an enlightened space spiritually. Whatever you choose, I find that it’s helpful to see and say these phrases every day. Write down your affirmation on a piece of paper or a fun cut out and hang it on your wall. Whenever you find yourself needing to, read the phrase aloud. The more you say it and see it, the more you’ll believe it.",2017
5 Ways to Stop Anxiety from Lowering Your Self-Awareness,"If you continually limit your awareness of your thoughts and feelings you disable your ability to evaluate internal and external information. Blocked self-awareness decreases self-confidence leads to poor decision making and fuels high anxiety. Here are five strategies you can use to help you get in touch with your feelings and emotions increase your self-confidence and awareness and help relieve issues with high anxiety so you can keep progressing in life. 1. Embrace your faults and flawsAcknowledge your imperfections and mistakes rather than trying to deny or distort them. Hold yourself accountable for the outcome of your choices no matter what even when things don’t go to plan you will always learn from mistakes and having the courage to live bravely and admit them is much more commendable than running away and hiding due to the fear of judgement. People will always judge you no matter what you do in life so accepting this reality is an important life skill in developing a coping mechanism to control how you respond to it. When we try to be a perfectionist, we can fuel our high anxiety due to our never-ending fear of being wrong or not fitting in so what! Love yourself in your entirety including your flaws and faults and learn to feel secure in the knowing that life does have a way of trying us at times but getting back up owning it and moving on is fundamental to decreasing anxiety and enabling success in life. 2. Display your emotions accordinglyLearn to express your feelings calmly and confidently and where appropriate to particular situations in your life. Develop your personal boundaries and know what you are prepared to tolerate from yourself and others so you know how to show up emotionally competent and avoid overreactions caused by anxiety. Emotional intelligence is an essential life skill and is becoming more and more standard practice in schools, workplaces and everyday life. I highly recommend reading Daniel Goleman’s book Emotional Intelligence to help you recognize, understand and manage your emotions. Learning how to handle emotions both our own and others is key to decreasing anxiety especially when we are under pressure. 3. Acknowledge your individualityBe secure and confident in your uniqueness and embrace individuality. We all acquire different skills and learning in life, yet so many try to change and shape themselves on others and end up losing their sense of authenticity. Your uniqueness is what makes each and every human being distinct in their way and you should embrace this instead of trying to put a mask on and eliminate it. As the quote by John Mason goes “You were born an original don’t die a copy” 4. Be direct in your communicationDon’t get in your way by talking jargon. We have a tendency in human nature to distort reality by wandering in our language and communication style. I was a rambling professional, and as a result, it created a sense of mistrust in myself and a lack of confidence in my ability all this led to high anxiety in social settings and networking. Learning to slow down and make the connection with my mind and my mouth has enabled me to become less anxious. When I was indirect in my communication, I frequently over complicated my life, and when my rambling language led to questioning of my beliefs and opinions, it ironically left me speechless because I lost my confidence in my ability to respond. Learn to use simple, clear, direct language and train yourself to catch jargon using your self-awareness by reading other people’s responses to your style of communication. 5. Be OptimisticFocus on the solutions and not the problems. There is always a solution if you seek to unlock it and not block it. Be prepared to work through matters that arise in your daily lives with family and work colleagues by collaborating with mutual respect and a wider perspective. Being an optimist will help you to find the answers which help you and everyone concerned to move forward with confidence and decrease anxiety about the desired outcome. People who look on the bright side of life have a lot more to look forward to not to forget to mention increased health and longevity in life. In light of practicing the above strategies if it is a case that feelings of high anxiety and insecurity are constantly consuming your daily life and thinking it may be time to consider a more structured plan of action from a suitably qualified professional. Most importantly the focus of emphasis should be on healing the underlying cause and nurturing a growth mindset to enable a forward focus. Take action now. “Nothing diminishes anxiety faster than taking action” — Walter Anderson",2017
Music is my Sanctuary,"It’s been a rough 48 hours. There has been a lot of heavy emotion, hard conversations and a general sense of needing to get in the car and drive away from life. I became aware of this depressive period on Tuesday after hanging up from two intense work calls. One working through expectations, heated words and accusations in email and the intended therapeutic “When you said this, I felt this way…” A four-way conversation on Skype where you cannot see someone’s reaction is weird. I immediately went into another call with completely passive/aggressive, are we seriously revisiting these decisions again?! It’s the worst part of being a PM, I think it’s resolved, but no, we need to rehash it 15 more times in two weeks to make absolutely certain and sure it was the right choice. 99% of the time we decide, yes, it’s the best decision (insert face palm, head banging the wall emoji here). I hung up from that second call and the weight of immense sadness washed over me. I fell into the pit of despair. I was home, another snow day. Thankfully towards the end of the day so I just shut my computer and went for a walk. With music. On repeat. Music helps me through a cycle of feeling so hurt and not understanding where the emotion is coming from — to being absorbed in lyrics — to relating to the artist — to feeling a bit better (even if I haven’t figured out my own emotion). Tuesday it was Muddy Waters by LP. I miss the days of albums with inserts and song lyrics. To sit and read along as the singer moves through their own emotion (thankfully for Genius, I can still enjoy this). Later in the evening I connected with two friends, each helping in different ways to talk through my stuff. Less isolation and loneliness. Yesterday was also hard. I couldn’t concentrate. Had total Squirrel! going through my head allowing myself to be distracted by less pressing deadlines and emails and avoiding the really important ones. Just going through the motions. I had plans in the evening and kept waffling if I should go or gracefully bow out. I went to PT in the afternoon and did 45 minutes of really hard Pilates therapy. I was shaking by the end. Being physical helps me process emotion and now in hindsight, I see it really bubbled up what I had been processing, and simultaneously avoiding, the last 24 hours. I decided it would be better for me to go to the evening plans and connect with people I knew and could understand or provide comfort. I would not necessarily say it was a mistake, and at the same time it was. I showed up, said some hellos, got a drink. All was fine until I started actually talking to people. People who know me on varying levels. Immediately I noticed that the tears wanted to rush out. I was biting the inside of my lip so hard. It’s how I keep tears at bay, sometimes it’s too much. Twice they started welling up in my eyes and thankfully both times I was talking to friends that knew. While they may not know what exactly was going on with me, they knew enough to see I was in pain. I couldn’t even talk. I was started to have anxiety and panic and I knew I needed to leave. I said my good-byes and while heading out — ran into someone coming in who asked if I was staying. Telling her I was “just OK” and heading out, she asked if she could hug me. I said yes (tears welling up again) and it was SO what I needed! I barely got out of the bar before the tears came. By the time I got to the car I was sobbing. I needed to just sit there awhile and let it go. I pulled it together enough to drive home. Listening again, on repeat, to LP’s song. I was home before A returned from swim team, just barely. I don’t know why I was trying to hide it from her, pulling it together to be the Strong Mom, there for my kid. Holy hell she is so smart and perceptive — she could see right through me. She asked why I was home so early (I think she was expecting me to return after she was asleep) and I told her I was depressed. She still doesn’t know what to do with that, we’ve only recently started talking about it. She gave me a hug and got ready for bed. I did too, got ready for bed. Disconnected from my brain and emotion and Facebooked. I watched Samantha Bee. I went to sleep. Today, I feel better, going through that intensity clears my head. Somewhat. I still haven’t figured out all the pieces that got me to this depression period. Depression by a 1,000 paper cuts seems to be a pattern. And writing this is helping a lot. I’m about to go into an all-day meeting with another company to talk about inclusive hiring. I’ll be putting my game face on. I expect by the end of the day, the only thing I will want are PJs, comfort food and early sleep. I’m getting there — and know each person I have touched the last 48 hours has gotten me here. I really appreciate that and continuing to ingrain that I’m not alone and being honest about my mental state only helps get me through it faster. I’m not asking anyone to fix it (is it just me, or do other with depression constantly feel like people try to fix it?) and I don’t know what I’m asking for today. Perhaps it’s just, yeah Jen that sounds hard, can I give you a hug?",2017
A study of lazy,"Life doesn’t move in consistent units of time. Sometimes it feels like I’m measuring my life in hours, sometimes weeks or months. My work of this unit of time, whether it turns out to be just for today or for a few weeks, is doing less. My therapist has been suggesting that I make work for myself, and I assign tasks when I could be relaxing and giving my brain and body a rest. So instead of lying in the sun on my bed, I’m writing about this. First of all, taking a break from everything seems almost un-American. We valorize working our dicks off, staying up all night to work and falling asleep in our seventh cup of coffee. For most of my life, I was in school. And nothing encourages work without love or passion quite like public schooling. No offense to public school teachers, I know y’all do your best. But school measures how much time you can put into something you don’t necessarily care for. I was amazing at this. I could start any class and within a few weeks determine how much effort I needed to put in to get A’s. For this, I was consistently rewarded, and always tired. I woke up at 5am for before-school extracurriculars, and stayed late for after school practices and meetings. I worked hard, and adults recognized and appreciated me. At home, working was just as important. My parents rarely took a break, each in their own ways. My dad would work in the yard, bake, tinker, take photographs, fix things, and exercise. My mom would clean, sew, cook, crochet, write, research, organize. They would each take a break at night to read or watch something, but all day, they were busy. I learned that doing something was the way to be, the way to show your family you loved them. In college, I learned to do another kind of work. Without the social crutches of secondary school, I had to figure out how to be as social as I needed to be happy. I learned to chat up strangers at bars, go to improv jams, take on side-projects with talented friends. I taught myself to cook so I could feed my friends to save money on eating out. Of course I didn’t have an actual social calendar, but if I had, it would have been packed. And I was pretty happy. All of this fun was the same as time off, right? As anxiety and depression set up roost in my brain, everything started to exhaust me. I couldn’t deny anymore that I’m tired, as much as I wanted to. Mainly, I feel like I don’t have the right to be tired. I know people who work harder, face higher stakes, and make it through. I wish I were tougher. I wish I could be mentally ill and still work like I used to, and play hard, like I used to. But that’s not realistic for me right now, so I’m working on something else, instead. I’m beginning to suspect that my therapist doesn’t think I can ever truly calm down. She might be right, I’m not sure. I’m amazing at making work for myself- much like my parents, when I was growing up, even my down-time is productive. I re-pot plants, bake bread, write, go to shows. I’m not sure I know the difference between work and leisure. Isn’t that what they say- do something you love and you never have to work a day in your life? So how am I supposed to know when I’ve truly chilled out? Since I feel somewhat at a loss, I’m going to start trying to be as lazy as I can. Just as an exercise. Actually, the more I think of it as a challenge, the more approachable it feels. Because if you’re not going to be a lazy piece of shit at 23, when are you going to? And to assuage like, 5% of my guilt, I can remind myself that I’m working through a lot, and anyone, if given the chance I have, to take a break, would take it. So in the times between my job, my classes, and therapy, I’m trying to be true garbage. I’ve invested in more leggings so I can wear only stretchy pants at home. I bought frozen produce so I don’t have to grocery shop as often. I brought my childhood video games from home so I can play old video games. I’m trying to take inspiration from my friends who seem to have a more comfortable balance than I do. I guess this comes down to patience. I struggle to have the patience to deal with my mental health slowly. So maybe it will help if I slow everything down. If you need me in the next week, day, month, I’ll be in bed. Or in my hammock. Possibly reading, possibly napping. Hopefully I’ll be one of the laziest people you know soon.",2017
Why Well-Being Programmes Often Don’t Work in Big Business,"I walked on the ground floor of the eight story building and watched banks of human beings wearing headsets, glued to their chairs, staring at computer screens, answering call after call. “Good morning, you’re speaking to Adam. How can I help you?” “Good morning, you’re speaking to Sarah. How can I help you?” “Good morning, you’re speaking to Melissa. How can I help you?” “Good morning, you’re speaking to Mark. How can I help you?” “Good morning, you’re speaking to Amy. How can I help you?” The room was well lit but almost completely devoid of natural light. “The problem”, one of the managers told me, “is that they are taking calls from stressed, angry, upset, and often aggressive people all day long. We’re finding that after a while they become anxious, stressed, unhappy and then leave. Our turnover rate is just too high. We have good facilities, drinks and snack machines, kitchens on each floor, and a staff canteen, but it doesn’t make any difference. We need to increase their resilience, help them to become mentally stronger, and stop them from leaving. That’s where you come in.” The staff at the contact centre work shifts of between 8 to 10 hours long with one 30 minute break for lunch (unpaid) and two 15 minute breaks (paid) that are timed from the second they log out. Conversation with the person sitting next to them is frowned upon and almost impossible to do. All calls are recorded, monitored, and randomly listened to by a manager to ensure guidelines and procedures are being followed at all times. They also have targets that include average call time, time between calls, and conformance to breaks and shift times. They have to be at their desks, headsets on, and logged into their computers with all software and programmes set up and ready to run at the time their shift starts. This takes between 10–15 minutes for which they are not paid. Many of the staff were provided by an agency and paid the minimum wage, and those who were permanent were paid just a little over the minimum wage. “I don’t think I can help you.” I said. The manager looked surprised. They were offering me good money and a long-term consultancy contract. My type of training is often in demand on corporate well-being programmes in an attempt to make up for bad business practices, lousy company structures, and poor treatment of the human beings they call staff. They get to tick the box marked ‘well-being’ and think a chat about mindfulness will solve all of their problems. It’s like using a water pistol to put out a towering inferno. I may still do a one off training session with staff, with the understanding that it it will be universal in it’s approach and not focused on their day-to-day work with the company. In these sessions we predominately cover values, purpose, presence, awareness of automatic thinking, and managing energy. The sessions are often a wake up call that lead to a spike in staff leaving the company to pursue other work, education, goals, or pathways. Some companies still allow me to do these sessions as they see it as a way of pruning uncommitted staff. If big (and small) businesses want to get serious about the well-being and mental health of their staff, they need to start treating them like human beings and get the basics right before trying to use a sticking plaster over a gaping wound. Pay people fairly, give them the time and tools to do their job properly, and treat them with dignity and respect. That will improve your business and their lives far better than any well-being programme from the latest mental health guru.

Life in the dark: Depression Diaries,"But let’s not get ahead of ourselves. I feel I owe you a bit of background before we go any further. I’ve dealt with general anxiety since I was a child; I can vividly remember misplacing a toy whistle at age 7 or 8 - just some shitty plastic thing we had hundreds of lying around at school - and the sheer panic and guilt over something that had literally zero value… it’s hard to explain the depth. Even then I knew that I wasn’t reacting “normally.” I could understand that sadness or longing were logical but that the anger, self loathing and dwelling on something so insignificant were not. But the thing about anxiety is that even when you *understand* that it’s illogical, you still feel it. And it only makes you feel worse that you can’t control it or explain it away. By the time I hit puberty the anxiety wasn’t just reactive — I started getting these horrible self deprecating thoughts that would spring up out of nowhere. I started playing with self harm to distract from those thoughts — in the beginning it was rubber bands and literally banging my head against the wall. At 13 I read a book* about a girl who cuts herself and a few months later, snuck a knife into my bedroom at night and made a few shaky weak lines across my thigh. I picked there because I knew it would be hidden by my school skirt and it seemed solid enough that I thought it would be easy to slice through. It wasn’t. But I’m a quick learner and by 15 I had my tiny toolkit of self destruction — it included an extra sharp protracor, a broken shard of glass and a letter opener I stole from my mothers desk set. I called it “bleeding out the pain.” Mostly because I was a dramatic teenager but also because then it felt as though my self harm was a tool to relieve my anxiety and depression, rather than a symptom. *I’d like to clarify that in no way do I think reading the book turned me into a cutter or made me depressed. Don’t shelter your children. Let them read of darkness — it may be the most relatable material they ever get to experience. At 16 I was the happiest I’d ever been. School work was getting aced. Social life was blossoming; standing invite to the Friday night popularity parties. Magically I seemed to grow into my body really well and my awkward humour and nerdiness became #adorkable and completely unique. I had a boyfriend for the first time ever who was completely in love with me. Yet one day I walked into my house, went to my room to do homework and ended up eating two bottles of painkillers. Cleaning that vomit out of my carpet was super fun. Two weeks after that I found an old Barbie set — it was the equestrian doll that came with a horse and stables — and I held the tiny plastic broom under a flame from my stolen lighter until it started to melt and then held it against my arm until I couldn’t stand it anymore. 13 years later I still have a scar. It’s faded. But I can still see it. You might be wondering why I’m telling you all of this. See, it sets the scene. Gives some history. A few days before my 18th birthday my mother died. For a long time I wrote off my subsequent pain as unresolved grief and while that may be true to an extent it’s also important to recognise that the darkness has always been inside me. That tragedy may have amplified my depression to unmanageable proportions — like the six weeks I didn’t leave my apartment in university and failed all 6 of my classes — but it wasn’t created by it. Mom, it isn’t your fault. It never was. I’ve become quite good at the whole pretending to be okay thing. My professional reviews say things like focused, driven, a joy to work with, insesently positive, problem solver. But generally the effort I put into maintaining that in a public forum leeches from my ability to cope personally. To be clear, I consider real personal time the time I am alone. Until that point it’s still an act, an effort. Some people I don’t have to try so hard but it’s always running in the background like a battery sapping useless app. Draining, completely. So there are weekends I don’t get out of bed. I mean, at all. Not even to pee. Because the thought of hauling my body upright is too much to handle so I just roll over and ignore any hunger or pain that’s going on. This isn’t all waxing poetic about some far away past either. Last night I got home after a not entirely terrible day at work and without taking off my shoes or jacket I laid down on my bed, feet still on the floor, and cried. For hours. I cried so much that I feel dehydrated today. My eyes are itchy from the constant stream. When I said at the beginning you don’t get to choose your time I meant it. Usually I can keep it together until I’m alone in the dark. That constant struggle leaves it’s fractures though. Last year I was in a particularly negative spiral. I was drinking too much, avoiding my dark thoughts and ignoring how that delicate facade was starting to crack and then it happened. Not just a tiny break in the surface — this wasn’t just a cry session or a few broken plates — this was a full breakdown. I was fortunate enough to have a very good friend nearby on day one of the great 2016 destruction who got me out of work to talk because I couldn’t hold a pen my hands shook so bad. Words, something I’m usually pretty comfortable and fluid with, they wouldn’t come out. I was scared of going home and being alone. I was scared I wouldn’t wake up. This would be a big breakdown too. It didn’t take a few days or weeks to overcome. I was wrecked for months before I started to get my shit together. I mean, pretty quickly I pulled the strong image back up but it was scary times for me and those in my inner circle. The circle began to grow as I let people in — I’m always amazed by the number of incredible people in my life — but it was still that number one who was there through the severe panic attacks and dark pits of despair. You know who you are. I will never be able to thank you enough. If you ever doubt your worth remember that in 2016 you saved a life. Last weekend I got out of bed at 10 am and cleaned my house — like.. serious cleaning. I defrosted the freezer and disinfected the splash boards and everything. This week I accepted a huge project at work and have already delivered phase one, it’s only Wednesday. On Monday I turned down a drink to go to the gym instead. It’s a good week. Despite the crying. But today someone told me I have a face like thunder. Which bothers me on so many levels. Fuck the expectation that I have to look happy/beautiful/interested at any given time — but that’s a rant for another time. But mostly because I wanted to smack them and point out everything that I have achieved already. I want them to understand that on a pain scale I live my life, every day, around 7. Living is painful but I endure. I put aside pain to make myself more productive/positive/approachable. This is with the voices in my head telling me I’m shit. Telling me I will always be alone and a failure. I walk home to the looped soundtrack of the worst moments of my life. And when that gets too easy to handle my douchebag brain starts coming up with new fears to focus on. Have you ever lived a moment that never happened? Because I have played out the death of every member of my family a hundred times. It’s my current obsession. Will it be the cops, the hospital or another family member that tells me? What will that conversation be like? Who will I have to say goodbye to. Every single day. So yeah, maybe I have a face like thunder, you cunt. But if it’s one day of thunder in six months then I think I’m doing pretty good. Give me a high five, motherfucker. Why am I writing this? I’ve been alone in the dark long enough. You may all be anonymous brains floating in the ether but we’re in that ether together. Maybe if I share a bit of the darkness with you I’ll have more room for the light. And if you have these issues as well then, hey, I’m here. We’re surviving this day by day together. Don’t give up. And if you can’t even fathom this level of pain then just keep in mind that the chirpy girl at work or that friend who always seems on the up and up.. they might. It’s impossible to know what’s going on underneath still waters. It’s deep and the current is strong. Never assume you understand. But if you’re willing to be there for someone, listen when they’re ready then you can maybe, just maybe, take a tiny bit of that burden off of them. Because it is so tiring being alone in the dark.",2017
Let’s stop pretending Mental Health is this uncomplicated thing,"If you tell someone you’re feeling down because you suffer with depression then the likely response you’re going to get is “Me too mate, me too” or “Stop moaning, we all can’t arsed but you don’t see us complaining”. Now if everyone knew the true details behind the life of someone suffering with anxiety and depression I don’t think they’d respond with this quite so much. I want to share my story with you, I want to open up and not lie about how mental illnesses aren’t that bad, because they are. Now I was lucky, there are people out there that have it so much worse than me and I’m not here for the pity patrol or to tell you how bad my life is because I’m not, I love my life and I’m happy. I’m not a writer, I’m not a story-teller but I’m just here to show that I’m not ashamed to admit that I suffer, that I’m sick of pretending that it doesn’t effect me. Imagine what it feels like to be drowning, water entering your lungs, you can’t breathe despite you trying. You’re choking, you’re panicking — you feel like you’re going to die. Now imagine all of that without the water, welcome to the world panic attacks. I was a fairly happy person, or so I thought. I now know there was so much wrong with me emotionally that I’d pretended was normal since being so very little and it wasn’t until someone began to love and care for me that I realised it wasn’t normal. It panicked me and thus I spiralled down into such a common yet ignored situation of anxiety and depression. I was having panic attacks everyday, all day. I had a good job as an apprentice and I was good at my job up until this moment. My productivity disappeared, shortly followed by my motivation and will to care about anything at all. I spent months off trying to fix myself and only getting worse. It wasn’t until February when I was at my worst that I saw how bad it was. I had to leave the TV on just so I had something comforting me into my 3 hours-at-a-time sleep. I had helplines on speed dial 24/7 to the point where they started ringing me at a scheduled time to check if I was ok tonight. All I ever did was sob hysterically and sleep. I wanted to cease existing. I could tell it was causing stress on my family and my girlfriend which made me feel worse, it kept me off work, which made me feel worse. Everything made me feel worse, even the things I did to cheer myself up — I knew I was doing it for a reason and this, surprisingly, made me feel worse. I remember thinking to myself “Why am I not normal?” I’d watch hundreds of videos from people who were in the same situation as me and pointing out the slight differences as to conclude that I was never going to find a fix “They only suffered for a month.”, “I think about this when I’m panicking, they don’t. What’s wrong with me?”, “I’m going to lose my job, their work was fine with it”. Each slight difference causing a panic attack equivalent of around 40 minutes, another thing I had different, panic attacks should only last for short periods of time! I truly believed that I was the only living person who was suffering with this and even if there were other people, no one had lost their job because of it or suffered with it exactly how I was, I was going to lose my girlfriend, my car, my job, my life? On and on it went. I was exhausted, exhausted of thinking, exhausted of worrying, crying, exhausted of being exhausted. My girlfriend and family were so supportive and tried their best to help me whenever they could, but the problem with anxiety is that it makes you paranoid, I thought they all hated me, they were sick of hearing about it. The amount of times I would ring my dad up, my sisters up and each time the rock in my stomach grew bigger and bigger with guilt and nausea. I didn’t want to stress them out as well but I was suffering. Imagine trying each and every technique there is to tackle anxiety/depression and it not working, or it working briefly for another wave of panic to take over your body and make you feel sick, shake you up, make you feel like you couldn’t move and were never going to again. I tried cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT), I tried beta blockers, I even had two separate Councillors after that and nothing was working. Yet another difference between me and every other “normal” person. To be blunt, death had never seemed like more of an appealing offer. I’d stop at the side of the road whilst driving because I couldn’t even be bothered doing that any more, there were times that I was tempted to just lie on the floor at work and not move, I couldn’t be bothered to breathe. I was at my doctors every week, they asked me how I was, they were brilliant but the only thing they could do was suggest tablets. I was reluctant to have them, surely I don’t need them. Everyone says they’re horrible, they make you worse, you can’t get off them once you’re on them. No, I wasn’t doing that. I held my head up high and confidently returned back to my room to cry all night long like I normally did. Work couldn’t deal with it anymore, and although they tried their best to support me, there was only so much they could have done for me — I knew I wouldn’t have a job at the end, I wasn’t working hard enough — I barely worked at all. What a waste of two and a half years of hard work. My colleagues lost patience with me and I became distant from them, alienated at home and at work. Looking back I’m surprised I even survived this period of my life, I’m sat here writing about it but I’ve never ever experienced pain and suffering like that before. It may seem so petty to you but imagine waking up every morning and having that literal drowning feeling, being scared of everything, even your own thoughts — it hurt, it was tiring. I couldn’t do it anymore, not on my own. I needed those tablets. They started me on sertraline 50mg, not too bad a dose but I definitely noticed it. Sat on my bed, eyes popped open with my chin through the wall I knew it was doing something. Side effects caused complications with the tablets and after around three weeks of a roller coaster of highs and lows I moved onto Fluoxitine. Fluoxitine was well known in my family, a lot of them were on it and swore it was the best thing to ever happen to them and so I was determined to stick to them. They made me so much worse, a couple of months went by and I couldn’t count on both my hands the number of times they made me contemplate suicide. Time to change again; Citalopram. Up and up my doses went and during this time I was having to apply for another job, all of my other apprentice friends had got a job and I wasn’t stupid, I knew I was going no where with this. I started applying for jobs in an area I realised I actually wanted to do. I struggled and scraped through my NVQ and college work thanks to my friend and my teachers — I wouldn’t have done this without them. Having completed my apprenticeship, I succeeded in getting another apprenticeship as a developer, something I’d always wanted to do, and was finally in a nice environment where I could focus on rebuilding my confidence. Don’t get me wrong it didn’t end there. The tablets were making me aggressive, they zapped my libido and were making my life just genuinely confusing. Mood swings, side effects… I could go on and on and on, however on the whole it calmed down a lot, I changed back to Sertraline and I’m still, to this day, changing dosages. I rarely have a panic attack now but I think that’s definitely down to a few factors: Mental illness is very real. It’s happening every day, every hour, every minute to people we see everyday. Your colleague, the one who’s always having a laugh, he probably goes home, drinks a beer and stares at the TV but instead of engaging with it he’s thinking about how much easier it would be if he took his car and drove himself into a ditch, that he quite simply can’t be bothered facing another day because he’s exhausted of being taunted by his thoughts. Mental health isn’t an “Issue” as such, it is a lack of the very thing we need to survive; affection. Being patient, listening, or just being there for someone will make all the difference in the world. Someone with anxiety and depression just needs someone to tell them they’re ok, they’re safe and that they are very normal, they’re human. Even I, when I was younger, would be quick to roll my eyes at someone having an anxiety attack but this was down to my upbringing; I’m not talking about the way my parents raised me towards this subject, I’m talking about the lack of education on these sorts of issues. I think the one thing I learned from all of this is that you can’t see internal wounds, you can’t feel other peoples suffering, so be kind and patient to as many people as you can, you’d be surprised at how many people you would impact positively. I’ve tried to be as honest as I could during this piece of writing and I know it’s all jumbled up, not consistent and a bit of a brain fart but like I said, I’m not a writer, I’ve written this as it’s come into my head and I probably wasn’t as detailed as I could’ve been but I wanted to offload this somewhere as quickly and honestly as I could. I probably wont read this through after writing it because I hate having to relive it again and again, but I hope this gives you an insight to one person’s life and if you’re suffering out there, I hope you relate to this and know that it’s going to be alright eventually, everyone is different so don’t compare yourself to anyone, take your time and do whatever the hell you need to do to make yourself better.

You’re not the only one with anxiety when waiting for college answers!,"Abby: I understand how nerve-wracking the whole waiting period can be. It was hard for me too. I feel like the best thing you can do at this point is remember that everyone else is in the same boat as you — all waiting to hear back from colleges. Just sit back, relax, and trust that you gave it your all in those college applications. Shayna: Now is the time where you await for your college acceptance letters. I have to let you know that you may get rejections. It’s totally normal and you should not beat yourself up for it. Maybe you let your parents down because these expectations put upon you are very real. When I got my first rejection letter from a school that my friends got into, I immediately felt left out and told them that I got in too. I admit, I was afraid of the rejection and believed I was not as good as my friends. I understand that the waiting period may be a dreadful time for some. Just remember that your feelings are valid, but do not let them define you! Vanessa: If you get rejected, allow yourself to grieve and be sad for a short period, then plan an alternative route to where you want to be. This looks different for everyone. Maybe you might have to take a gap year, work, attend community college, or choose the the best school out of the ones you got into. Just because you haven’t reached your initial goal, doesn’t mean you won’t attain your larger one and just because your plan is not ‘traditional’ doesn’t mean it won’t work! This is how I’ve dealt with rejection in general and although getting rejected from anything sucks, it helps when you have a way to face it.

Instilling Self-Esteem into Kids,"I think the most important thing you can do for your child right now is instilling self-esteem into them. Specifically, I’m talking about children with neurodevelopmental disorders, but it applies to all kids. When I started studying neurodevelopmental disorders like ADHD, autism, etc. I was blown away by the number of children diagnosed with a neurodevelopmental disorder that are also diagnosed with things like anxiety and mood disorders like depression. It’s no surprise that people and kids with low self-esteem also are accompanied by things like anxiety, extra stress, depression, and low social skills. This is where you need to empower children and give them self-esteem and self-confidence. Kids with neurodevelopmental disorders get told all the time about how they’re different from the norm. They need to realize that if their strengths aren’t like everyone else’s strengths, that’s a good thing! Personally, I don’t want to be good at what everyone else is good at; I want to be good at what no one else is good at. If you sit back for a second and audit your kid and see what they’re good at, let them know they’re good at it. Make them feel great about what they’re great at. There will be enough people to point out what they’re not good at; you need to tell them what they’re awesome at. We often get in this weird state where we try to push our kids to be better at what they’re bad at and turn them into an expert in that subject. I was absolutely terrible at subjects like English and Spelling in school, from early grade school through high school. Word check and I are super tight. I still remember dreading English class as a junior in high school. I’m so glad no one forced me to be the best English student just because that’s where my weakness was. Yes, I realize I still need to put words together, form sentences and have the ability to read and write. But ask me what a gerund is. Or, when they’d give you pieces of a sentence and ask you what order to put them in so the sentence sounds the best. Seriously? I. Don’t. Know. Once you see what their strengths are, let them follow their interests. Notice what they put the most time into throughout the day. That’s most likely what interests them. Then, support that interest. If they find something else that interests them more, support that. If you give a kid high self-esteem and confidence, and something that interests them, and even combine that with something like ADHD where they will laser focus on what drives them, they will crush it and be great at what they do.",2017
"Purpose, Complacency, and Anxiety","The notion that our technology and sociological advancement provide us comfort and independence is foreign to the Torah world-view. In fact, comfort itself can be anti-advancement. When the Jews left the slavery of Egypt, they were leaving behind both the bonds of physical labor and the burden of an anti-spiritual world-view. Even the word for Egypt, מצרים comes from the word for narrow, צר, which also means suffering. The whole society was built on physicality without respect for intimate relationships, and worship of physical representations of spiritual ideas. The way this nature was established as its foundation was through the source of its livelihood: the Nile. The Nile was the sole source of irrigation in a primarily agricultural society. Everything depended on the Nile. Unlike in the land of Israel, where people depended mostly on rain, Egypt didn’t have to turn to the heavens for life. שאו מרום עיניכם וראו מי ברא אלה, “Lift your eyes upwards and see who created these” (Isaiah 40, 26). They were comfortable, and their comfort kept them in their narrow world view, never thinking about where life comes from and what they could do to bring it down. Leaving the Egyptian mentality required the Jews to journey into the dessert without provisions and to depend entirely on sustenance from heaven. That was the only way they could begin to see things the way G-d sees them. You also see this idea on a more individual level. King David said שמרני כאישון בת עין “Guard me like the pupil of the eye” (Tehillim 17,8). The Midrash explains Davids request in a metaphor, like two people, one from the north traveling south, and one from the south traveling north, asking each other to guard each other’s vineyards. The Maharal explains (Nesiv HaTorah 16), just like each person has something precious that is far away from him, every Jew has a soul that is too spiritual to really belong in this physical world. That’s why a person feels like he needs special protection. Just like the pupil of an eye is extra sensitive because of its refined quality, so too the soul feels vulnerable because it doesn’t really belong in this world in the first place! This feeling, if it is directed properly, catalyzes a person to strengthen his relationship with Hashem through Torah and Mitzvos. It pushes him to recognize that the only reason his lofty soul is enduring in this physical world is so that he can acquire the goodness of a relationship with Hashem. But when he ignores this feeling of vulnerability, he can ignore the higher part of himself and just go along his merry way without ever getting beyond the surface. Or, he could stay in a kind of middle ground, where he doesn’t totally ignore it, but also doesn’t open up to see things differently — and that’s where you find anxiety. Its the place between sublime calmness of purpose and the complacency of ignorance is bliss.",2017
A Path to Help Ease Depression and Anxiety,"I decided to explore exercise and nutrition as it relates to mental illness. It turns out there is a correlation between exercise, nutrition and improved symptoms of depression. This also holds true for anxiety disorders. Researchers have also determined exercise is a tool for treating — and perhaps preventing — anxiety. A study published in 2005 found that walking fast for about 35 minutes a day five times a week or 60 minutes a day three times a week had a significant influence on mild to moderate depression symptoms. Anxiety disorders are common psychiatric conditions with a lifetime prevalence of nearly 29% in the United States. https://www.flickr.com/photos/aryaziai/ Arya Ziai, 3/5/13 Anxiety is defined as a feeling of worry, nervousness, or unease, typically about an imminent event or something with an uncertain outcome yet people with anxiety disorder experience it without a precipitating event. There are medications but some studies have found that adults who engage in regular physical activity experience fewer anxiety symptoms. This supports the notion that exercise offers a protective effect against the development of many mental disorders. One of the most obvious, yet under-recognized factors in the development of major trends in mental health is the role of nutrition. The body of evidence linking diet and mental health is growing at a rapid pace. The evidence indicates that food plays an important contributing role in the development, management and prevention of specific mental health problems such as depression, schizophrenia, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, and Alzheimer’s disease. How Does Exercise Help How does exercise relieve depression? For many years, experts have known that exercise enhances the action of endorphins, chemicals that circulate throughout the body. Endorphins improve natural immunity and reduce the perception of pain. Exercise and other physical activity produce endorphins which in turn improve the ability to sleep, which in turn reduces stress. High stress levels have long been linked to depression. During my research I read about a woman who was diagnosed with depression that was largely resistant to drugs and therapy until she discovered running. She then experienced a dramatic improvement in symptoms. She started running every day and within a few weeks her depression significantly improved. My Personal Experience Personally, I started an exercise program about a year and a half ago and notice that besides feeling physically better, my outlook has become much sunnier. I try to go to the gym at least three times a week either to take a class, strength train or hit the treadmill. Though sometimes I have to drag myself there, I am always glad that I made the effort. I also try to eat healthy foods that include nuts, fruit and vegetables. This, combined with exercise, has resulted in significant weight loss as well. Some suggestions So what types of exercise should you do to alleviate symptoms of anxiety and depression? Try walking, running, strength training, yoga, tai chi, gardening, even just washing the car. All of these will get your endorphins flowing. Are you anxious? Take this test to reveal your anxiety level: http://www.calmclinic.com/anxiety/treatment/exercising. The test revealed I had moderate anxiety. Some of the questions I answered “strongly agree” to were: “Do you worry about your health or dying?” “I think a lot about why I do the things I do” “I have trouble sleeping”. Maybe I should try to step up the exercise and lay off the twinkies!",2017
Dealing with stress and anxiety as a student?,"There are a lot of pressures on students today, and many struggle with stress and anxiety. Moving away from home, living in a new city, sharing a house with new people, splitting bills and dealing with student debt, cramming for exams, trying to make new friends, the causes of stress and anxiety can seem endless. In fact, a survey by the National Union of Students (NUS) in December found that 78% of students had experienced mental health issues in 2015. Thankfully, there is a growing understanding of the mental health pressures that students face and a growing number of resources to help. The University Mental Health day was established by charities to encourage students to talk about their mental health and improve their understanding of how to support each other as well as seek support for themselves. Understanding mental health is very complicated and knowing what to do to help yourself or a friend can be equally daunting. However, there are some simply steps that could make a big difference in your life, or the life of a friend. The first thing to do if you are feeling anxious or stressed is to talk to your family, friends or peers about it. More often than not, your friend will be feeling similarly and you’ll be reassured you’re not alone. Whether its stress caused by relationship issues, trying to get on top of coursework or dealing with your student living arrangements, you may well be going through the same things. By talking to your peers you will be able to better understand what you are experiencing and try to support each other. Often talking to your academic tutor or professor is a great place to start. They will be able to give you a world of experience and advice that could really help relieve some stress. If you are facing academic difficulties, which is causing stress, then talking to your tutors to let them know the situation is incredibly important. They will be able to support you in the best way possible to help you handle your academics in the healthiest way possible. Your student union may well have a welfare officer who can direct you to the resources they have available to help students suffering from stress. It might be that you need financial advice to help you manage your student finances, or help with living arrangements if you are sharing a house with others, for example. Student unions are often well resources to help with these situations. There are many many charities and services that are focused on supporting people suffering with mental health issues, and in particular students. Here are a list of charities who specialise in supporting students mental health; Student Minds Young Minds Mind Staying healthy, eating well, doing exercise and getting sleep all seem like basing concepts. But these simply things can go a long way in helping you deal with stress and anxiety. Likewise, nothing beats finding something you are passionate about, and spending time with people who share that passion. So get involved with student groups or societies, meet new people and make amazing friends. University is an incredible time in your life, so don’t worry if you’re nervous or finding things difficult. Many people do. Best of luck with the year ahead and have an amazing time!!

Don’t Blow Your Fuse,"I should be use to it by now. The last minute projects and unreasonable deadlines. But I’m not. I’m getting better at caring less, which is nice. But unfortunately, I still have my moments of feeling overwhelmed. You know when you try to power up too many things in your house and the circuit breaker trips? That’s essentially the same thing that happens to us when we’ve got too much on our plate. Tasks start to seem impossible, we feel swamped, we stress out and we snap. The only difference is as human beings we can’t just flip a switch to bring the power back. Our minds are more like fuses, they pop and we have to start fresh. We need time to recover. The problem is that most of us don’t give ourselves a moment to rest. Even when we “rest” we’re occupied by technology or entertainment. We keep pushing ourselves, forcing things and staying busy until our lives start to feel like quicksand. Everything we encounter makes us feel like we’re sinking deeper into an abyss of to-do lists. We have to come to terms with the fact that we have a limited amount of energy, mentally and physically. Using that energy wisely and sparingly is the key to preventing burn out. Everything can’t be done at once and I don’t think many of us need to be told that. We already know it. And I don’t think we need advice on how to get things done or where to turn next. I think we struggle because we refuse to stop. We’re programmed to go, go, go like machines. We’re all capable of knowing and understanding what our next best move is, we just have to get out of our own way. There’s this silent intuition that’s in all of us. It’s nearly impossible to hear when we’re constantly hustling and juggling. We’ve got to settle down a bit. Why do we want to get so much done anyway? Where are we going? What are we trying to accomplish. Riddle me that. I’m supervising two interns and I’ve been blowing fuses for the past month. But on the days that I can remember to stop, care less and cut myself some slack, my days are a lot lighter. I might fail at maintaining my image of the superhero, but at the end of the day I go home with a smile because I know that at least I still have enough energy to play with the dogs and laugh with my lady. Plus, I usually slack off on Fridays, so there’s always that to look forward to. app.convertkit.com Oh, and do you mind clicking that sweet little green heart? Thanks, love you too.

Are you really an introvert?,"Are you an introvert? Are there things you feel you can’t do because you’re introverted? A colleague of mine said “he’s a smart dude, but I wouldn’t put him on stage in front of 100 people”. I was within ear shot, he was talking about me. Being “smart” is all about perception and perspective so I typically ignore those types of comments, but the challenge was laid down. 5 years later, 2 of my eldest kids start school and my wife and I are discussing our concerns around them fitting in. I said “I wouldn’t worry too much about Jasmine making friends. She’s shy, like me, but she’ll settle.”. My wife turns to me and laughs. “You are not shy”. I pause for a second, a bit confused and say “of course, people have been telling me all my life that I’m shy”. “How can that be true?” she says, “I’ve seen videos of you bounding around on stage in front of hundreds of people. Shy people don’t do that”. Working in technology, most of my friends and colleagues would categorise themselves as “introverts”. If you’re reading this now and thinking you’re an introvert too then I’m going that challenge that face on. The difference between an introvert and an extravert was summarised well from a psychologist I heard on the podcast hidden brain, An introvert get’s their energy from spending time alone. An extrovert get’s their energy from being with people. In 2009, I took the Myers Briggs test, which had me as an INTJ. So social psychology has me pegged as an introvert. More recently, I have made demolishing any preconceptions about my own ability to do “extroverted” things a priority. I have put my hand up to speak at 15 events, spoken in front of crowds of up to 300, been a guest on 3 podcasts, and after all that, I still deep down- consider myself shy. At a large event, I feel highly uncomfortable in the “networking” sessions afterward, especially at bars where I can barely here people I often find myself stuck between conversations or just pulling back and listening to others. I know I’m not the only one, in fact I’d go as far to say that the majority of my friends are very similar. Digging into that generalisation about introverts, what is it about large crowds, meeting new people and busy situations that makes us introverts so uncomfortable. Often, I struggle to keep up with conversations in noisy environments, so I retreat to just sitting back and watching the people and dynamics. Straining to hear can be very tiring. When thrown in front of a stranger or introduced to someone, my confidence is cumulative. If I’m feeling confident that day, or week, I’m more likely to spark up conversation. If I’m having a bad week, filled with anxiety, negativity or just circumstance then I’ll retreat more. It’s not my personality, its my situation, my own issues with anxiety (which I’ve spoken candidly about). When we think of extroverts we picture that loud, confident sales person or leader we’ve all met. But having travelled with many of them in the past, I know once the crowds are gone, they sit down, sigh loudly and relax. They are tired too. We’re all in the same boat. After all, an introvert gets “their energy from spending time alone”, so why do I get lonely? When it says Energy, is that Energy from people, or energy from the right people? I love spending time with my friends, shut in a booth in a nice quiet bar, over dinner or just on a road trip. It’s that one-on-one conversation that I relish, gain energy from. It makes me happy, relax, and confident to spend time with good friends. Spending a week with friends, or on holiday I often need time alone to think and not just talk. It’s all about balance. I’m not an introvert. Nor are you. There is no such thing. You are your own person, make your own boundaries, relish your own strengths, values and challenge perception. Time alone is O.K. Enjoying time with others is O.K. Don’t hold back based on labels",2017
Anxiety & Entrepreneurship,"“Oh, you have anxiety? Yeah, I was super stressed last week, I totally get it.” “Oh, you have depression? I was sad when my cat died.” How very condescending of you, to relate my actual diagnosed disorder that causes me daily suffering and most of my brain power to dwell on, to that one time you couldn’t sleep, were sad, or felt a bit anxious. You can’t see anxiety. It isn’t a physical scar, a broken bone, or a prosthetic leg, and when we can’t see something, we try to understand it in the context of our own experiences. That’s human nature, and very understandable, but I would prefer you to ask questions or at least pretend, before assuming that my almost-debilitating disorder is ‘no biggie.’ I was diagnosed with Generalized Anxiety Disorder when I was 19, and had diagnosed (and sometimes medicated) insomnia for many years prior to that. I did not take anti-anxiety medication, and for a long time, was using counting, breathing, and some meditation techniques to help me control it. The anxiety fed into the insomnia, and I would get stuck on a loop in my head, unable to sleep. It got worse over the years, and I counted more, breathed more, slept less. By 30, the anxiety had grown to the point where every single day I was anxious about multiple “what would I do if the bridge collapses/a gunman appears/a bomb explodes?” My life was made up of worst case scenarios. I would get very anxious inside, a knot in my stomach, heart beating faster, brain going a mile a minute, until I mentally decided how I would react to any given situation, before I could start to relax. This was my normal. Every bit of turbulence on a flight convinced me of my impending death, walking up a long flight of stairs made me question what would happen if I slipped and fell down them, and I was constantly trying to calculate how far from a bridge/train platform/plane I could fall and still live. Hours per day of worst case scenarios, and I didn’t even realize how much I was really effected. It happened over time, from being a little anxious and thinking some about different possibilities, before slowly growing in my mind to these horrific events that I had to figure out how I would react to. It grew over time, and I have always tried to be very aware of my emotions so that if I were feeling erratic or anxious, I could monitor myself and try to talk myself off the ledge. Also at 30, I finally started my own business. I’m a writer and editor, a blogger, a ghostwriter, a book editor, a social media manager, and more. I was working full time in my day job, a sales career of 10 years, and building my business on the side. It was stressful, but I was surprisingly not super anxious about it. Being a writer and editor relies on my skills, specifically on skills I am extremely confident in, and I have always been a hard worker. I was working 80–90 hours a week, working every night after work until bedtime, and working on the weekends, to get my writing assignments done for clients. I was making money and was able to go down to part time at my day job, which allowed me more time to build my business, and I plan to go full time at home soon. The writing didn’t make me anxious, but the idea of leaving a perfectly good job and career and steady paycheck, of course there was some anxiety there. But for some reason, having new clients and being so extremely busy all the time was not triggering overwhelming anxiety. There was a bit of a cloud over my when I thought about working from home full time, but mostly I was excited. It’s funny, little every day things caused unending anxiety and tight stomach muscles, clenched fists, and even an occasional migraine, but this huge, life-altering decision felt easy. Even though I wasn’t specifically anxious about entrepreneurship, my heavy, daily anxiety about everything and anything continued to weigh on me. In a big admission, I decided to ask for help. I’m incredibly lucky that my husband supports my choices, tries to understand my anxiety, and has often taken a primary role in talking me down. I spoke to my doctor and only 6 weeks ago, started my first ever low-dose anti-anxiety medication. Honestly, even the thought of taking the meds made me anxious and kept me up at night. They said it would take about 4 weeks to fully kick in, and I spent the first 2 weeks battling a light dizziness that lasted all day. I almost quit, I didn’t think it was working. If anything, it was distracting me from working at the level I should be, with how busy I was. Week 3, I felt a difference. The dizziness faded, and almost without me noticing, I started to mentally gnaw on things less. About a week later, I had a sudden realization that I hadn’t once thought about dying that day. Sounds simple, maybe, but I haven’t gone a day without thinking about potentially deadly scenarios ever in my memory. It’s been a significant weight off of my shoulders, my chest, and my sleeping habits. I’m sleeping better than ever, I am more focused and less distracted, and I am finally able to live without constantly thinking about dying. It’s not erased, the anxiety still exists, but it’s muffled now, and I can live my life without constantly dwelling on it. I’m an entrepreneur now, with everything that entails. Marketing myself, new client prospecting, proposals, writing, editing, project and time management, being at home with my cat, managing myself, and more. I love it. There will always be some anxiety, but I know deep inside myself that this is what I should be doing. And I refuse to let anxiety rule my life or keep me from my dreams.",2017

4 Ways to Manage Your Anxiety While Job Hunting,"While many Americans made merry over the holidays, thousands of workers dealt with the cold reality of layoffs. Economic uncertainty breeds downsizing, and many companies — including big names such as GM, Walmart, Microsoft, AT&T and Oracle — have implemented or announced layoffs. It’s not a coincidence that The Conference Board’s Consumer Confidence Survey is giving some cause for pause. Most people who have experienced a layoff begin to panic about how they’ll support their families while they search for something new — a process that can take weeks or months. Many of these stressors revolve around the uncontrollable elements in your life: “How am I going to support myself while I search for a new job? Can I even find a new position in my field? Will I have to take a pay cut?” Research shows: • Depression rates are much higher for people who have been unemployed for more than a year. • Unemployed individuals are three times more likely to abuse alcohol. • Unemployed men visited with doctors more often and took more prescription medications than men with jobs. With countless questions swirling around in your head, you could have trouble sleeping, concentrating and relaxing. You might also suffer from fatigue, headaches or stomachaches. These are all classic symptoms of generalized anxiety disorder. You’re probably thinking, “I’m screwed. As if finding a new job weren’t stressful enough, now I have to deal with a bunch of anxiety!” Maintaining your mental and physical health while you’re unemployed isn’t easy. But it is possible. Here’s how: 1. Get Moving It might be tempting to spend all day lounging on the couch in your pajamas, but you’ll benefit from physical activity. Research has shown consistent exercise can reduce the symptoms of generalized anxiety disorder. Workouts cause the body to release endorphins, adrenaline and serotonin, triggering positive mood changes and lessening depressive thoughts. 2. Lean on Your Support System In addition to being a great song and film, “Lean on Me” should serve as a personal motto for anyone who’s unemployed. Emory University neuroscientist Seth Norrholm argues that social support is key to reducing stress and anxiety. Spend time with family, friends and other unemployed individuals — unless they’re sources of stress, of course. It will give you a chance to vent in a nonjudgmental environment. This focus on networking will also increase your chances of getting hired by learning about job opportunities and others’ job-hunting experiences. The worst thing you can do is isolate yourself. Keeping to yourself during a time of crisis can fuel a vicious cycle that will only drive you further from your ultimate goal of re-employment. 3. Help Yourself There are plenty of self-help treatments that can control your anxiety. These include yoga and meditation, whose daily practice has been shown to provide relief from anxiety and depression. Just make sure you’re using the proper techniques. For example, stress causes most people to breathe in a shallow manner. Focusing on slow, controlled breathing can help you get the most out of these mindfulness-based therapies. 4. Be Prepared Job interviews can create a lot of anxiety, but proper preparation is the best treatment. Spend time researching your prospective employer, combing through interview tips online, anticipating questions and rehearsing your responses. Not every interview will result in a job offer, but that doesn’t mean you should get discouraged. Replace any self-defeating thoughts (“I blew that interview; I’m never going to get a job”) with positive ones that focus on what you’ve learned (“I should emphasize my continuing education efforts more next time”). Losing your job is a decidedly stressful life event with the potential to cause detrimental health effects. That’s why looking for a new job and managing your well-being go hand in hand. Keep yourself occupied by volunteering and exercising, lean on your support system and take time to practice relaxation techniques. These seemingly small steps should help curb your anxiety and could help you find a job much more quickly.

9 Ways to Stay Focused at Work After a Breakup,"Here are nine tips and tricks from relationship therapists and top HR pros for honing in on what matters at work, even when your mind is elsewhere. 1. Use work as a distraction. In a healthy way, of course. “Focusing on work is not a healthy coping skill if it goes too far and you are avoiding the breakup and your feelings altogether, however, your job can serve as a healthy distraction to cope with the loss you’re feeling,” explains Lisa Bahar, a therapist based in California. While throwing yourself completely into work is too extreme, fully engaging when you’re in the office will help take your mind off of what’s going on. Bahar advises switching off your cell phone and staying away from social media while at the office. Instead, put your focus on actively participating in what’s going on at work. Devote your attention to one thing at a time versus multi-tasking, as this helps decrease anxiety and keeps your brain busy. She also suggests that you leave on time and don’t go in early — you need those hours outside the office to take care of yourself more now than ever.

On a similar note, Nancy Halpern, executive coach, recommends that you keep up with any healthy habits you have. “Eat right, sleep, exercise, and reach out to your friends and family,” she advises. “They are your best support network and they’re separate from your work life.” It’s true that the majority of the venting you do about your split should happen outside the office, so call the people you know you can count on to help you stay on top of your mental health. Now’s also when you can take the time to do things you maybe didn’t have time for before, like cook yourself healthy dinners, go to the gym as much as you want, and finally get around to incorporating a quick morning meditation into your routine.

Halpern also suggests letting one or, at most, two coworkers in on the fact that you just went through a breakup. You don’t have to get into the nitty gritty details with them (and shouldn’t) but it’s a good idea to have an ally if you need one.“ Ask them to help by taking you out for short breaks so you can recharge, like grabbing a cup of coffee or taking a walk around the block,” she suggests. “They can also be ‘spotters’ if you feel weepy or are looking disengaged.” 4. Try batching. If you’re having a hard time staying on track at work, it could be the perfect opportunity to try out a new productivity technique, like batching. “Batch together tasks that you frequently do so that you can be more effective,” says Brittany King, senior recruiter and founder of The Career Collective. “This will help you stay focused by keeping you on task.” New ways of organizing your day can help you keep your mind on what you’re doing, rather than dwelling on your breakup or getting wrapped up in your feelings. [Related: 5 of the Hottest Productivity Apps to Download Now] 5. Work with other people when possible. “Interacting with other people rather than doing solo work tucked in a back office is a good way to distract yourself,” says Gretchen Kubacky, a psychologist based in California. If there’s a department meeting you normally would skip or you have a chance to work on a team-based project, now’s the time to go for it. When you’re engaging with others, you have less time to think about what’s going on in your personal life. 6. Don’t go overboard. While it’s definitely advisable to concentrate on a specific task that you can devote yourself to, tackling the biggest project you can find immediately after a breakup is a bad idea. “You’ll probably just get overwhelmed, which will make you feel worse about yourself,” explains Halpern. Keeping your self-esteem high when you’re vulnerable is important, so choose projects where you know you can succeed through hard work. 7. Make new habits. You’re probably making new habits and routines outside of work, and you should definitely be doing it in the office, too. For example, “if your habit is to pick up the phone and text your now ex throughout the day, replace that with another habit such as taking a quick walk, drinking a bit of water, or texting a friend,” suggests King. Before you know it, the new routine will feel like second nature. [Related: 8 Morning Rituals That&’ll Transform Your Workday] 8. Make plans after work. If you feel super alone during your time outside of work, that emotional distress might seep into your office life. “Schedule lots of things to do, from movies with friends, to dinner with family, to taking a new course at a local college,” says Halpern. “Schedule yourself three or four nights a week out so that you have lots of things to look forward to.” 9. Use a to-do list. It’s simple tactic, but an effective one. “At the end of the workday, make a list of what you need to accomplish for the following day,” says King. “This will guide you through your workday and help you stay laser-focused when your mind is tempted to wander,” she notes. Not having to wonder what you should work on next will definitely leave you less time to think about your breakup.

Amazeballz Stories Day 82/100: How your HUSTLE is working against you,"Recently I came down with a terrible headache. I could function but I didn’t want to. I just wanted to sit somewhere and breathe and do nothing else. The headache sucked, but I could sense what it was made up of. That headache was my nature telling me I had once again gone too far in the quest for EVERYTHING, all the time. Life is made of sine waves. Life goes up and down. In waves. Relentless waves. Life is always changing, always moving. We think we always want it to be moving UP. We want MORE! We want growth. We want strength. We want energy. We want to accomplish. There is no shame in a down cycle. A rest cycle. If I do not choose to have a down cycle, then the universal forces will find a way, because the cycle must occur. If I do not choose a fallow period, the fallow period will find me. You cannot out-hustle nature. I have had plenty of forced fallow period. Fever. Earache. Headache. Ugly moods. Lack of creativity. Anxiety. Depression. It’s like my body is saying “Down girl!” My oh-so-human body reacts to my refusal to choose rest and recuperation quite forcefully, like a bad dog trainer. I’d MUCH rather choose a way to rejuvenate than have one of those foisted upon me. I try many creative ways to force stillness and recuperation. Some ideas seem good, but in reality do little to truly refresh me. They just don’t last long. Whereas, some methods seems to pack a rejuvenating punch into a short time frame. Our culture, which constantly worships at the alter of HUSTLE will deceive you into believing that “you can rest when your dead.” This is true — as long as you understand that literal death will come sooner to those who do not honor the sine wave of your biology. We must create. And then we must rest. We must grow. And then we must rest. We cycle high. And then we cycle low. We cannot escape it — no matter how hard we try and what lies we believe. We live (and thrive) in a sine wave. If we fight the cycle, the whole thing becomes tired and anemic. The highs are lower. The lows are higher. Our sine wave gets shallow. This is not the life we dreamed of. Nature will help us grow and thrive and overflow with creativity and making-ness — but ONLY if we honor the whole cycle. When is the last time you celebrated a down cycle? When is the last time you chose to rest? Hi! I’m Mary — a chiropractor, a writer, a marketer, and a teacher.

Always Everywhere,"A year ago, I weighed as light as 75 pounds. Today I’m the heaviest I have ever been: 105 pounds. But that doesn’t mean I’m no longer afraid of food, that I don’t skip meals, that I don’t say I’m not hungry as my stomach rumbles in objection, that I don’t want to purge. I still want to cut out the fat in my stomach. I still feel like I take up too much space, even more now that I’m bigger, nearly 50% bigger — nearly half a person bigger. People used to worry I would eventually disappear, but now I’m always there, always everywhere. My favorite pair of jeans: the classic mode of realization. I knew this would happen during the recovery process. Hip-hugging pants that bled from a slim waist and flat stomach to a blobby muffintop. At least on the days I can get the damn thing past my thighs. I used to look great in those pants, the only one who could pull off bell bottoms in the 2010s. In a blog post I wrote last May about my eating anxiety, I said I felt like I took up the entire room. Well, now I live in NYC, where my room is less than a 10 x 10 box that I share with my pug who takes up more space than is proportional to his size. More often than not, the door is open and the window is cracked — to add even the tiniest bit of extra room. But even with these extended parameters, I feel as if I am suffocating. That I don’t fit inside this box with walls pushing against my large frame. My room is kind of like my jeans. If I jump around a few times and suck in my gut, maybe I can shove myself inside. But the zipper and button, the door and window, need to stay unlatched. With fabric draped over them, no one can tell I don’t really fit. That I’m bubbling over the seams, leaving red indentations on my skin, sometimes stamping patches of blue from loss of circulation. Always, always it’s hard to breathe.",2017
3 Things I Do to Control my Anxiety,"I have been plagued by anxiety for as long as I can remember. Sometimes, it happens at random, but often, there’s a trigger associated to it. Over the years I have developed ways to help me handle my anxiety in different situations, other than just simply running away from it. I hope this helps. One of the things that trigger my anxiety is using the phone. Whether it’s to call someone else or to answer an unknown caller, I almost always get panic attacks. As a child I always refused to pick up our landline, opting instead to disconnect the phone so the ringing stops. However, this is unavoidable. In situations when I do have to make a call to someone I don’t know or someone I have never contacted before, I ask a friend to literally hold my hand while I’m on the phone. Most of my friends know how prone I am to panic attacks, so they readily help me in situations like this. They help me calm down by reassuring me that the call will turn out well, that I won’t say anything unpleasant, that the person on the other line doesn’t think I’m stupid or annoying, things like that. I used to be embarrassed about the fact that phone calls make me panic, so instead of facing the problem, often I’d just ignore it. Eventually though, it became necrssary for me to get used to making and answering calls especially when I was looking for a job. So, I decided to get help and told my friends about my situation. Today, I am able to answer unknown calls by myself, though I’d still have to talk to someone afterwards especially when the call ends badly. If you feel ashamed that your triggers are trivial, it’s totally fine. However it does help to have at least one or two people know about your situation so they can help you without being asked. 2. Develop healthy fidget habits Panic attacks differ from person to person. Sometimes it’s staring into space and not moving at all, other times it’s fidgeting and pacing. Many of us have different fidget habits: nailbiting, skin picking, twiddling our fingers, etc. However, there are some habits that can be pretty destructive. I know someone who bites on their cuticles, yes cuticles not nails, when they’re anxious. Sometimes it gets to a point where there are tiny wounds on her fingers. This is why it’s important to develop healthy fidget habits. When you feel fidgety, instead of picking your skin or biting your nails, try to release tension by keeping your hands busy. Keep a handy pen and notebook with you and let your hands just squiggle the pages. Try looking into Fidget Cubes or other small toys that can help. 3. Reach out as soon as you can All of us have different coping mechanisms, so this takes some personal preference. If you can reach out when you feel a panic attack coming on, when you’re going through one, or once the anxiety dissipates, do it. Talk the episode through with someone. It helps normalize the situation and distract you from overwhelming emotions. I have a general fear of being alone in crowds in huge public areas. I hate taking trains of crossing major roads because it triggers my anxiety. When that happens, I look for a safe space, then text the first person that comes to mind. Retelling the situation to someone else reminds me where I am, what I was doing before the panic attack, and what I was planning on doing. These are simple things, but they go a long way. If you feel like these will do nothing to help you, try and develop your own ways to cope with panic attacks. Also, you can always seek help from a therapist. There’s nothing wrong with feeling out of control sometimes, and there’s definitely nothing wrong with seeking help from family, friends, or a professional.",2017

The repetitive nature of healing can be frustrating.,"Healing is frustrating, lets just call it what it is. For all of the good that we are doing for ourselves in the every day work of being a survivor, it’s just flat our frustrating at times. There are many reasons why it’s frustrating, not the least of which is the repetitive nature of this journey. You work so hard at your recovery; reading the books, watching the videos, being mindful, setting healthy boundaries, practicing self-love, self-validation, everything that’s involved in your individual journey, and you wonder just when you are finally going to see the fruits of your labor. One of the very difficult things about healing is the fact that you may very well go over the same topics repeatedly. You think you have worked through a memory or event, only to have the feelings associated with it, resurface a few days later, a week later, a month, a year or more. It can feel like no matter what you do, the same feeling(s) continue to resurface. Perhaps it’s a healthy boundary that continuously gets tested, or a mindset that you can’t seem to shake; one of self-shame or self-doubt. I could on and on with examples of frustrating things that I experience in my journey, and I’m sure you could write a list a mile long yourself if you really think about it. Hence, the repetitive nature of healing. I voiced this concern not long ago in a talk with a helping professional. “Why in the hell do I keep going over the same shit, again and again”? We’ve talked about this multiple times before, often in the exact same context and surrounding the exact same circumstance; when will this stop being an issue?” I asked. It sometimes feels like I’m spinning my wheels, not making any headway. I voice my concern, she gives me a similar response or the exact same response as before. I get frustrated, upset with myself, aka self-shame, and I leave the talk without feeling any real sense of accomplishment. A feeling like I just wasted the last hour rehashing the same junk we talked about 2 weeks before. How is this possibly making me a better person, how much healing can I accomplish if we keep having to go over the same thing more times than I can count? Is there a point to all of this healing, is there a point to all of this time and effort? Each time I’m reminded of one thing…over and over, both in my head and from the wise voice who counsels me: Healing is repetitive and it’s not linear. As difficult as it can be to embrace that healing is not linear, it can sometimes feel easier to embrace that rather than embracing how repetitive this journey is. It can feel like you’re continually beating your head against a wall and expecting it to not hurt the next time you do it. You know that old saying, “doing the same thing over and over expecting different results…”. The reality is that the same thoughts do keep coming back, and they will continue to do so, but in time they will get less and less if we are committed to healing. It doesn’t mean that we are broken, or that we are some odd ball case that no therapist has ever seen before. It just means that we are survivors and we are human, and that it takes time to work through thoughts and feelings that have been fostered over years, decades even. Whether the trauma you suffered was a one time event, or lasted for years; the thoughts, feelings, and our reaction to future situations created during the trauma, are not simply fixed with the magic wave a wand. Wouldn’t that be cool if it did though? Yes I’ll take that magic wand Fairy God Mother, heal me and I’ll get on with life! Some areas that I have personally struggled with: The truth is, that I know the answers to these questions, I’ve talked through them more times than I care to admit. When these and many other similar questions come up, I have to be careful to not dwell on self-shame, depression, and a total lack of confidence about why I am putting myself through all of this recovery. Perhaps you’ve been there, or are at this place in your life now? Do you routinely wonder why the same things keep coming up and seem to slow your recovery? If so, you can see that you are not alone, I’m right there with you. Here are two things to keep in mind that will help you: It’s all about accepting each trial and celebrating each victory in it’s own way, for what it is. Working through each and trusting that the process can help shape us into the person we want to be. Knowing that we are slowly but surely healing and as time goes on there will be more and more wins to celebrate. Each time you deal with a repetitive thought or emotion, you are one step closer to it being not so repetitive. -Matt Pictures courtesy of Pixabay.

Generalized Anxiety and Negative Thoughts — Overview,"Individuals who experience panic attacks aren’t men and women who experience greater quantities of stress than folks who don’t experience panic attacks. Generally, those who have panic attacks have them since they do not deal properly handle the principal bouts of anxiety that exist in their lives. In case you are experiencing severe anxiety attacks or panic attacks, you have to realize your family physician. Anxiety disorders have a tendency to run in families. Anxiety disorders are usually the result of a composite of psychological, physical, and genetic aspects, and treatment is, generally speaking, very powerful. It’s the most frequently encountered anxiety disorder among the elderly. Stress can also lessen sex drive. Chronic stress may influence fertility. It can exacerbate existing diabetes by impairing the patient’s ability to manage the disease effectively. It’s still extremely important to manage tension and anxiety to stop piles from returning. Depression is rather common among anxiety sufferers. It is highly treatable when an individual receives competent care. It affects a significant portion of the population. It can seriously impair a person’s ability to function in everyday situations. Well, it is the way the anxiety works. Mild anxiety aids in boosting your concentration on managing a stressful circumstance. Should you be experiencing excessive anxiety or worry it is reasonable to lower using non-prescription drugs and caffeine. Anxiety makes it nearly not possible to quit focusing on things you don’t need to concentrate on. The anxiety isn’t simple to control and is therefore an issue for all areas of ordinarily life. It is so powerful and so sudden that it seems as though it would be impossible to reverse such a process! Generalized anxiety has to be chipped away from all sides and that’s what CBT is intended to do. Anxiety is more than merely a feeling. There are lots of excellent strategies to take care of anxiety, you just have to find what works best for you. Social anxiety is quite a prevalent psychological issue. You might be extremely embarrassed by every one of these symptoms when you have social phobia. Distinct individuals have various symptoms. Indicators of anxiety disorders may range vastly based on the sort of anxiety. To put it differently, a means to reduce the indications of anxiety is to be fully, mindfully, anxious. You must quit shaming yourself, and quit feeling like you should push these thoughts away. The ideas and behaviors connected with GAD in teens may get so debilitating that therapy is imperative. It will provide you with an idea of whether you’re experiencing anxiety, how severe your anxiety is compared to the remainder of the people, and what exactly you are able to do to deal with it. It’s usually recommended to observe a specialist inside this area as they have a practice that is geared toward the anxiety disorders. Persistent and negative thoughts are among the most frequent signals of an anxiety disorder. There are lots of sorts of irrational thoughts. The occasional bad thought is nothing to worry about.",2017

Imagine,"Imagine is one of my favorite words. Before any important action or any change can be accomplished, one must have a goal. Before the goal, there must be a vision. And visions are born from imagining. Imagination is like fire: it can be used to create or destroy, to foster hope or fear. Imagination gone bad creates monsters out of human beings, failures out of setbacks, and insurmountable challenges out of everyday risks. But like fire, if it is guided and built up correctly, imagination can be a powerful source of beauty. Sonnets, metaphors, centaurs, Perelandra, Star Wars, hobbits and jazz music were all born from the imagination. The Declaration of Independence, the Civil Rights movement, the telephone, electricity, and the first landing on the moon were also first born in the imagination. Choose to create something beautiful with your imagination. See the world with color. Find beauty in human beings, possibilities in setbacks, new opportunities out of rejection, and joy in the everyday. Like Martin Luther King Jr., dream a dream worth fighting for. Like Tolkien, create something that inspires people. Like the first astronauts to land on the moon, try something you have never done before. Like a child, imagine. :) Have fun.",2017

Paranoia,"Emily walked through the busy streets of London in a state of panic. Everywhere she went there were signs saying “It could be you next!” or “It is you!” Both were an advertisement signs for the upcoming lottery ticket winners. Emily was terrified of the on going killing spree of two psychopath killers who targeted girls aged between 18 to 24 and living alone. The killers had a special tradition, the police said — first they target the woman and then they follow her to her home where they kill her. Emily saw that she perfectly fit into that category. She was a 20 year old college student who lived alone. She used to work in the local tea shop for extra money and she plays the cello. When the band called her in for practice session she nervously agreed and she was in an anxious state until she reached the campus. After the practice session, she had to start her shift at the tea shop and as Kate was on a leave she had to cover her shift too and by the time she completed her work it was well past 9. Emily pushed herself past the crowds while dragging her cello with immense difficulty. She took out her pepper spray bottle from her backpack and put it in her coat front pocket and continued waking in case anyone attacks her. As she kept walking she saw someone stare at her for too long. A chill ran down her spine. She walked faster, but with the added weight of the cello it was becoming difficult for her. She held the cello case with both her hands and continued dragging it and suddenly she bumped into another person coming from the other way. The man held her steady by her hand and asked “Are you okay” Emily was engulfed in fear. He was the same man she saw staring at her a few seconds ago! “Leave me alone!” she hissed and walked away. After a few steps she looked back to see if he was following her and to her horror he was still staring at her. She increased her pace now, and in spite of the crushing weight of the cello she didn’t stop. Just five more minutes she thought. And as she kept walking someone jumped in front of her holding her water bottle, “I believe it’s your’s, it fell down over there” a guy around her age said. He’s doing that on purpose. He took my bottle to find a reason to talk to me and stalk me and then … She snatched it and without even saying thank you she ran off. From the corner of her eye she saw that the guy was now following her and to her horror he took his phone out and called someone that he found another gig. Is that what they call their victims? A gig? She was terrified. The guy continued to walk behind her and Emily’s panic hit new levels. She was sweating profusely and she left the cello on the footpath and broke into a run. While running she took out her taser from her backpack and also the pepper spray from the coat and held it in her hands and continued to run. When she finally reached her apartment, she warned the security guard to not allow anyone into her flat. She locked her room and and placed a chair against the door in case they try to break in and she took out a knife from the kitchen placed it on her bed stand and peeped through the window to see if she was still being followed. To her horror she saw the guy who gave her the water bottle talking with the security guard. She wanted to cry. What does he want from me? Why does he want to kill me? God please don’t let anything happen to me, please. She sat beside her bed on the floor and cried a little, she wanted to call her mom and dad but instead she took out her pills that her therapist gave her for her anxiety attacks and popped in three of them, she didn’t care if she overdosed. She stayed that way until she couldn’t no longer stay awake. The next morning when she went out to check her mail, she found her cello and a small note. “Found it on the footpath. I brought it here for you. -Alex” — - Dave was walking on the footpath when a 20 something girl bumped into him. She held her by her hand to stop her from falling down and the girl said to leave her alone. “I was just trying to help.” he said to his wife when he got home. “Why are college girls so mean?” “Maybe she panicked” his wife replied. “don’t take it to heart honey.” — - Alex was just coming out of a comic book store when he saw Emily walking in a panicked state while struggling to carry her cello. Her bottle fell out and he picked it up and ran to catch up with her and he hoped to strike a conversation when he handed her the bottle. He was a lead vocalist in the local band and he was thinking of asking Emily to join his band. He lived in the next block and he was familiar with Emily. He saw her in the tea shop and he also saw her once while performing for her college band and he was impressed by her skills. When she snatched her bottle off her hand he was a little hurt as he was just trying to help and make a conversation but she had to be mean, and he dropped the idea of starting a conversation as she clearly was in a state of panic, and just then he received a text from the manager of the bar offering them a gig and also an open audition and he called his dad to tell him about the gig. As he made his way home he saw a cello case with the initials E.G. Emily Gerald. Thinking that she must have been tired of carrying it around he picked it up to drop it off on his way home which was two houses away from her. When he reached the apartment the guard refused to let him in and he found no use in arguing with the man so he left it at the mail box with a note. Hello there! Thanks for reading!

Do Something Unexpected: Three Ways I’m Going Out of My Comfort Zone,"I’m not a impulsive person. I’m decisive, yes, and when I decide something I hate wasting time fluttering about. If we decide to paint the walls, it’s done by the weekend. If I want to read a book, I’m done by the next day. I’m also obsessive. I dive headfirst into things and once I’m set on something it’s rather hard for me to pivot. Ask my collab partner that I mentioned in my last post. He can definitely tell you how ridiculous and all consuming my obsessions can get. But this means that when I get set in my ways, I get set. Change drives anxiety, growth is terrifying, loss is crippling. So if I spend a week, binge reading/writing…well…there is a good chance that is what I will be doing for the next month, and getting out my front door for a change of pace is a struggle of epic proportions. These aren’t traits that are unique to me, by any extent. Everyone gets stuck in ruts at some point. Some more often, some less, but we all do it. The last few years I’ve been working really hard to take steps to get out of those ruts, to stop letting them define me, and where I’m going in life. So, here are three things I’m doing to get out of my comfort zone. I’d love to hear what yours are! So many people tell you ‘not to be afraid’, but that’s bull shit. Be afraid. Be anxious. Be whatever you are. Embrace it, examine it, and face it. Just go out, and do something unexpected.",2017
24 hours with anxiety,"So anxiety sucks. Like, really, well and truly sucks. While acknowledged by most people, as an unfortunate sufferer of anxiety I can tell you that a large amount of people approach the subject with remarks such as “cmon it’s normal to be a bit worried but you’re just being a drama queen” or “you just need to try harder and man up” or even once or twice “stop trying to be a special snowflake, it’s not a real mental illness”. Trying to explain it to people is really hard so I thought the best way to get it through to people might be to detail the day of an average anxiety sufferer to see if it makes it any clearer (please note this is an accumulation of my own and couple of other people’s experiences, it is not the same for everyone nor am I trying to imply that this is such). 7am: wake up. Knowing you need to get out of bed and have a shower to get ready for the day but instead you lie facing the ceiling dreading the day ahead. Your brain tells you that you won’t even make it out of bed today. You set an alarm for another half an hour and are determined you’ll get up then. 7.30am: Still not out of bed. Your stomach cramps and you feel dizzy and your brain is making you question if there is even any point in getting out of bed because you’re not going to be able to function well today anyway. Another 10 minutes and hopefully your brain will shut up. 7.40am: Okay, so your brain hasn’t shut up but the tornado of self-criticism and doubt is down to a strong breeze so you think you’ll be okay. You really want to get in the shower because you feel grimy (despite showering last night) but haven’t left enough time. You know you’re clean but for the rest of the day you’ll be plagued by thoughts that people think you’re dirty. Now it’s time to actually get out of bed. 7.45am: Wardrobe time. Any outfit you could choose won’t suit you anyway and you look disheveled anyway. You’re bloated and aching and you just want to be comfortable. So you pick up yesterday’s skinny jeans, pick a plain shirt out of your wardrobe and quickly put it on. This process took you far longer than it should’ve and you still hate what you’re wearing. “Hopefully your brain will shut up” 8am: It’s time to go through the motions. While brushing your teeth and trying to stay out of everyone else’s way you stick some music on in an effort to perk up your mood before it gets even worse — today it’s In The Heights by Lin-Manuel Miranda because normally if anything can cheer you up it’ll be that. Packing your bag makes the day seem even more daunting because it reminds you of just how much you’ve got to do, socialising in lessons and that one essay you’ve been putting off because you know whatever you write will suck. 8.20: You’re leaving for school, folders in hand but no breakfast. The anxiety is twisting your stomach so you feel ill enough without the sickness that eating breakfast will bring. Right, let’s go! 11am: you’ve successfully managed two lessons with minimal panicking. No input into class discussion seems likely today because whatever you say will be stupid and everyone will judge you. They won’t say anything but they’ll all forever think of you as an idiot. It’s break time and this time you do eat otherwise you know you’ll feel ill later. It’s a double free period next and you’ve got that essay to do, remember? 1pm: so you’ve written the essay. But you can’t possibly bear to reread or even look at it. You’re going to fail this course and the piece of work you have in your hands is complete trash. Just complete trash. Ripping it into a million pieces seems preferential to going to give it to the teacher but the thought of the teacher hating you and the confrontation that will ensue from not handing it in trumps your hatred of your work. So you hand it in but every step makes your legs feel more like lead. 1.10pm: lunch time. You’re stuck in a sea of students with no conceivable way to get out but to just go with the flow. Some deep breaths, in and out, in and out. The panic doesn’t subside for most of lunch so you sit on the edge of the group, half listening and scattering in a couple of “oh yeah?” or “mhm” just so they know you’re participating. Just so they don’t hate you. Though they probably do, you’re a bit messed up (as if today wasn’t a reminder). Someone across the circle notices you spacing out and texts you a couple of emoji hearts to try and cheer you up. It works but the shaking doesn’t stop. 4pm: school is officially over for the week. You’re home and suddenly confronted with the mountain of homework you need to complete. Opening up a word document you get ready to start. “deep breaths, in and out, in and out” 8pm: most of what was written was deleted within 5 minutes of it being written but you’ve done an essay and that’s an achievement in itself. You’ve gotta remember that even little victories are still victories on days like today. 8.30pm: dinner time. You feel less ill than earlier and even though you don’t feel like eating, you manage to eat a bowl of spaghetti bolognaise and drink a glass of squash. You don’t feel great but you know future-you will thank you for it later. 9pm: bath time! Your muscles ache from all the shaking and the general effort that went into today so you need to relax. Lying in the bath is the most calm you’ve felt today. Listening to a podcast gives you something to push away those intrusive thoughts for the moment (‘Epic Lives of People You’ve Never Heard Of’ by Cracked keeps you thoroughly sustained while in the bath 11pm: into bed we go, knowing full well you’ll be up for at least another hour because those damn intrusive thoughts just won’t go away. But y’know what? You’ll be okay. Y’know why? Because tomorrow is another day and you’re strong enough. You’re good enough. You are enough. This was inspired in part by a couple of articles on The Mighty, a recent Dodie Clark video and my own weird brain. I hope everyone who reads this has a good day and remember, you are enough.",2017
Let’s start from the beginning,"Recently, on a typical cold January morning just days before I went into labor with my daughter, my third and definitely final, child, I had an epiphany. It was in typical older Millennial mom fashion — through the ongoing group chat I have with three of my mom girlfriends whom I have quite literally known for over 20 years. Sidenote: We’ve know each other since grade school, and although we have not always been close (edit: I have not always been close with them. I infiltrated their group when we all gave birth to our first kids around the same time), they are very much my lifeline outside of my husband and mom. Back to my epiphany. As I said, we were doing our normal group chat when I realized the foundation for the anxiety and panic disorder I have felt for nearly my entire life — Having almost died when I was a toddler. So, let’s back up a little. What do I mean by anxiety and panic? Since I was a little kid, I have always been a worry wart. Most of this is just due to my inability to deal with the unknown. I hate when I am not in control or at least are able to heavily influence whatever it is that is going on around me. This is mostly manifested itself as a fear of getting sick; more specifically, I have a phobia of throwing up, otherwise known at Emetophobia. However, other sicknesses bother me as well, especially when it comes to my kids. I obsessively clean during flu season and count down the days until April starting in October. I basically live my life in fear that I, or anyone in my family, is going to get severely ill and end up in the hospital. So, its not that this blog will be about that. Really, I have just started it for self therapy. To put my fears (and joys) down somewhere.",2017
I’ve got a mild case of anxiety,"I stumble upon 5 minutes of free time and instantly the thoughts flood in–what should I do? I’m in the middle of 5 books–I should read, maybe I should work on my partnership agreements for my side business, the dogs need to go out, dishes need to get done, Amanda needs some attention, I really should be exercising, no I really should meditate. I know I’m not alone in the above scenario. Americans are notoriously anxious. As are Utahns. As are oldest children. I have a wonderful wife, 2-year-old daughter, and labradoodle. I’m 28 years old. I have a good job in an intelectually-challenging field. I run a small real estate investing company on the side. Pretty good situation, right? I am lucky. I am also anxious. I haven’t been diagnosed with anything–I don’t take meds. But I’m often irritable, I have little patience, and it doesn’t take much for me to feel down. I put a lot of pressure on myself and it’s taxing. It’s also taxing on my family. My anxiety has stolen a lot of potentially great evenings/outings/weekends from our family. It’s not fair to them. My anxiety has brought me to this crossroads–I can either go to a doctor and start taking anxiety medicine while maintaining the same lifestyle, or I can try to address anxiety by adjusting my lifestyle. The following series of articles is my journey doing the latter.",2017
"How to become unbroken, realize that is impossible, but come to feel better anyway.","It took a long time for me to realize that even though the sad, hard things that shaped me were not my fault, as an adult, it was my responsibility to heal. No one would, and no one could, do that for me. Not the purveyors of the hurt, and not the people who loved me. When I decided that I wanted to feel better, I had only the slightest idea of what was wrong. I knew that I felt insecure, I was constantly comparing myself to other people, and I was making up stories in my head about why people hated me and how their words or actions were clear proof of that. I felt like around every corner was a landmine and I had to walk so carefully through life to make sure I didn’t hurt myself or others. Yoga first set me on a path of healing, but it did not work alone. In many ways, yoga made obvious how much pain I was in. Until I started doing yoga, I mostly didn’t notice physical or emotional pain. Not noticing it was a way of not feeling or dealing with it. When I started yoga, I suddenly felt every ache and pain, and my emotions heightened as well. I found a therapist. She was a good match, and as I slowly opened-up to her, she helped me see how much I was hurting myself. It took a long time to tell her how I was feeling because my mind kept filtering my words and telling me that what I felt wasn’t important, or interesting, or justification for needing help. At one point I was seeing a therapist, a psychiatrist, an occupational therapist, an acupuncturist, a hypnotist, and a coach. It was a lot. Looking back, it was too much. But it taught me such a valuable lesson: I could ask for and receive help. I didn’t have to be alone. There were people out there whose job it was to help me feel better. For many of them it was more than a job, it was a calling. Seeing all these professionals took basically all my time, energy, and money. The adage, “work hard, play hard” didn’t apply to me. At this time in my life it was “work medium, play medium, self-care hard.” Every resource I had was spent trying to feel better. For the first time, I had to be more invested in myself than I was in my job, my families’ drama, and my friends’ lives. It was incredibly hard. At times, it felt like everyone was more invested in my healing than I was. There were many moments when I felt like I was throwing money at my problems, and my heart was not in it. Still, I don’t regret it. If you have the resources to do so, build a deep support network. Knowing how many people I had to fall back on, people who were not friends or family, gave me the security I needed to get better. It took three years of therapy, many psychiatric medications, daily yoga, and a lot of love before I felt noticeably better. Healing is a process. There were times when I thought I was healed and later realized I wasn’t, but that was part of the process too. I have accepted the little and big lies we tell ourselves to make it through life. There are still good days and bad days because the journey never ends. The journey is not linear. But I can say that my life is different now than it was three years ago, and by different I do mean better. The journey was a joy too. As my anxiety subsided, I found deeper connections with my friends than I ever had. As I explored new hobbies, I found new communities and formed new bonds. I learned to be honest and have hard conversations. I learned to take care of myself — to provide nurturing care, and not just comfort. I tried new things, traveled to new places, and took more risks knowing I had support to fall back on, to catch me if I fell (and I did), or to tell me if I was doing too much (and they did). For a long time, I wondered how I would know when I was better. It was a struggle for me to stay in tune with my physical and emotional self, so I questioned whether I would be adept enough to see and embrace changes. I was told, “you will know it’s working when you feel more like yourself.” That was both true and not true for me. It was true in a deep, spiritual sense. My soul felt more aligned. I felt more grounded and connected. It wasn’t true because I had felt so bad for so long that the joy, lightheartedness, and ability to sooth myself felt completely foreign. I wondered if it was all fake, and the real me was the sad, broken, disconnected version. The real me is probably both. Being broken is a part of being human. Taking responsibility for my own healing was the most amazing gift I ever gave myself. And, after being my own worst enemy for so long, loving myself feels like a super power.",2017
The Power Of A Digital Sabbath,"I’m not religious but I know many successful people who take a full day off once a week. I’m most familiar with the Jewish traditions, so I decided to emulate sabbath in spirit. No phone. No computer. No email. After almost four years, it’s a weekly touchpoint that has become a central part of my life. On Friday, when I wrote Generosity Burnout, I was exhausted from three weeks of travel. On Tuesday in San Francisco, in the midst of an endless downpour, I acknowledged to myself that I had started to feel “down”, which is a euphemism for “feeling depressed” for many of us. I hadn’t tipped to a dark place, but I realized that I had given myself a total lack of self-care since the beginning of the year. While I had a normal amount of work stress, with something new fucked up every day, I was feeling the emotional impact more and carrying around extra anxiety that was bordering on obsessive thoughts. Yesterday, I had a typical digital sabbath. I slept 12 hours, meditated, and then went running. Amy and I had lunch and talked. I then retreated to the couch and a read a book with her and the dogs. We took an afternoon nap, showered, and then went into Boulder for dinner with friends. We went to bed when we got home. I took action on the self-care front. I haven’t been drinking any booze since my birthday (@bfeld v51). I decided to stop drinking coffee, cancel all of my Q2 travel, spent two nights a week at home with Amy for dinner in Q2, and start saying no to everything new until I feel like saying yes again. I’ve got plenty to work on — there’s no need to add more to it. And I know I get a lot of satisfaction and energy from working on what is on my plate. I feel a little better today. I’m still tired and anxious. Meditation this morning was calming, as is writing this. After I hit post, I’m heading out for a run with the dogs. Originally published at Feld Thoughts.

How to Stay Positive in Uncertain Times,"When you are completely comfortable with uncertainty, a positive outlook comes naturally. You are not rattled by new events or tweets and can sustain faith that life will work out one way or another. It doesn’t mean you are not concerned or active in your community, you just tend not to worry so much about the future. Most people, though, have some degree of fear of the unknown, and turn either to negative or to positive thinking to help themselves feel certain, while deep down they are really afraid. The problem is that the certainty we seek doesn’t exist. The more we try to lock into any perspective, the more pain and chaos we feel. A person feeling negativity towards the Trump administration will feel pain most of the time because they are always projecting that whatever is occurring today cannot get better or that bad things are sure to happen in the future. The person trying to maintain a positive outlook will experience a roller coaster of emotions whenever uncertainty arises. How many times since Trump has taken office have you said, “I am going to try to be more positive about this presidency” only to fall apart when you come home and read some of his tweets about “3 million illegal votes” or CNN’s “fake news”? How many times have you woken up in the morning saying, “Today I am going to try to be more positive. I believe I can make a difference. I will win the fight against the nomination of Betsy DeVos or save the EPA and advocate for the environment”? Then, as the day or week goes on, you find out that Betsy DeVos is confirmed by the Senate and then read the news about legislation being introduced to get rid of the EPA. If you fear the unknown, these turns of fate will most likely propel you into a worried, anxiety-ridden, negative state. Our fear of what these events might mean for the future overtakes our ability to stay positive. I rode this type of emotional roller coaster for most of my life. After decades of struggling with the pain and pressure of trying to shape my perceptions positively, one day I heard a simple Taoist story that introduced me to the idea of Maybe. The instant I heard this story, my life immediately changed. I was struck with the realization that every situation has multiple possible outcomes. Maybe something else could happen other than the thing I feared most. It totally transformed my relationship with uncertainty. With the mindset of Maybe, we can stay positive and open because we hold onto the realization that we are not “stuck” when life throws us a curve ball. The minute we hear someone we oppose is confirmed by the Senate or there is another executive order banning immigration, we realize that we are not automatically doomed. Maybe we can manage the situation. Maybe we can file a lawsuit. Maybe the judicial branch will provide checks and balances. Maybe the Cabinet member that was confirmed by Congress will do some good things. Maybe we need to act. Maybe things will be tough for a while. Or Maybe everything in this moment is still okay. And yes, this also includes (as much as some people might want to resist) the idea that Maybe Donald Trump will pass some good legislation down the road. With Maybe we realize that uncertainty guarantees us only one thing — that life will change again, offering us new possibilities. Maybe is not a passive approach to life or a naive view of what is happening in the world today. Instead, it allows you to give up the projection of fear and worry about what this moment means for the future, and lands you firmly in the present. Being present allows you to act with strength and resilience and hold hope for a better tomorrow. We should celebrate our “not knowing.” It leaves us with unlimited possibilities. Here is a great Maybe exercise that I do when I feel fearful and unsure about the President’s actions. (By the way, if you feel positively about Trump’s policies, you run the same risk of being on an emotional roller coaster ride if you struggle with uncertainty. At some point, life will throw you something unexpected. So, this exercise is good for you, too!) Maybe Exercise First, spend a few minutes thinking about the current situation that is causing you stress and worry. Write down a statement about how you feel about it. Now ask yourself, are your worries and stressful thoughts absolute? Can you know for certain how things will turn out? If you are not certain, try to acknowledge that other possibilities exist. How does the thought that other possibilities exist make you feel? Next, challenge your statement with the idea of Maybe. Write down the following: “Maybe my beliefs about my situation are not true; Maybe what is happening is good; Maybe what is happening is awful but I can help improve the situation; Maybe I can find a way to accept whatever I am experiencing and still be all right; Maybe, in time, I will know what to do next; Maybe I need to act; Maybe there is something in this moment for me to experience.” You can put these statements in your own words or just use the ones above. How does your situation look against the idea of Maybe? Do you feel more hopeful? Do you see that the situation can work out differently than you were fearing it would? Write these Maybe statements down a few times each day and review them often. If you can, add more Maybe statements that challenge your stress and worry about the current situation. Keep your attention on these Maybe statements the next few days and see what happens to your fears and worries. Maybe allows us to see that uncertainty can be the most hopeful part of our lives. It actually supports us to stay positive with a looser grasp of what the future holds. No matter your politics, most often you begin to see that each situation you face has many possible outcomes. Maybe you need to march, petition, go to town meetings, run for office, or make your voice heard in some other way. Because if you don’t like what is happening today, Maybe with some time and effort things can get better tomorrow, or next year, or MAYBE in the next election. Keep hope alive!

Anxiety,"I tend to be pretty tough on myself and dwell on what I’m NOT doing. Sometimes that can be arresting to my productivity or rob me of enjoying the little things. I can be out on a beautiful sunny day at the beach but I can’t enjoy it because there’s a dumb project I want to finish. Not that the project is dumb but the feeling of that thing being anchored to my brain is dumb. I hate that. It’s almost never worth it if I were to leave and go do the thing, so why dwell? This is my greatest challenge. I’ve been putting a lot of energy into learning how to be better in the moment instead of manufacturing anxiety by assuming an outcome or response. I can’t predict anything, so why do I keep trying? I can’t foresee what the future will hold unless there is verifiable evidence that this will be the case, which is really only true after a bullet has been fired after being aimed in a specific direction. I get that feeling when I take a little long to respond to a client or have to push passed a deadline. I assume they’ll be upset and there will be this massive explosive response but most of the time my assumptions are proven wrong and everything is cool. Why did I waste all that time in my head? There was nothing to fear. Zero. It was all in my head. That’s just dumb. It’s straight-up unintelligent behavior of letting my brain, for so many years, get the best of me. The only time we have is NOW. No past, no future, just NOW. I lie, our past is pretty important. It’s how we learn and hopefully there are enough good things in anyone’s past to look back on fondly. So what I’m really saying is to not let the past, or any assumption of the future cloud your judgement today. Just go and do the thing. Now before you book that trip to Italy and max out all your credit cards, this is not some “typical millennial” call-to-action to quit your job, drop everything and travel the world. None of that will bring you any peace in the long run. I mean, yeah go do it if you want but with the knowledge that it is not a long term fix. Might as well do cocaine if that’s the case. It’s the same thing. Please don’t do cocaine. What I’m saying is that I strongly believe the key to long-term quality improvements in life come with a shift in mindset. To work on the ability to be present. I’ve failed so hard at that. Improv, therapy, lots of reading, talking to people to share my story and hear theirs…it’s all amazingly useful…and has helped me see that being in those moments, going from one of those moments to the next, leaves me feeling fulfilled. I strive every day to look around at my life and say “this is great.” I don’t think it’s an easy shift. It takes persistence. I think some people are born with the ability to look at life that way or life was handed to them in a way that allows them to only think that way. My personal struggle has been a years-long pursuit to let go. Decades even. I’ve talked about my bi-polar depression before so I won’t reiterate but it can feel silly to say out loud or exclaim my triumph over mental struggle publicly…to talk to yourself, to try and boost your own confidence or pat yourself on the back…that has always been weird to me but I’m completely doing that right now because I need it… …and that’s totally okay. People will knock you for celebrating any little triumph, make you feel like you shouldn’t enjoy what you enjoy, and they’ll try to denigrate your life because they can’t find the light in theirs. Sometimes they can be people close to you and that’s sad. It’s petty and sometimes they can just fuck off. Forgive my harshness but seriously, “haters are losers” to quote Casey Neistat. They need work on themselves. You’re not the problem there. I’ve struggle intensely because I’ve always been cynical of this concept of synthetic happiness. Synthetic happiness is the defensive mechanism our brain uses to convince ourselves that the decisions we’ve made are the best decisions despite other potential outcomes in which we aren’t able to see the result. It’s also that feeling you get when you see cute pictures of babies, or animals or unbridled love for something despite its flaws. There’s a great TED Talk about it that describes it in better detail. I’ve swam upstream against that concept, but why? Who cares? Why care about who cares? Am I trying to prove I’m smarter than people by being aware of that concept and rallying against it? I’m just robbing myself of life’s simple joys…for what? So I can be cynical and miserable? There’s no point in feeling silly about anything you think, feel or enjoy. Why regret? or question too much about the past? We can’t change it and even if the present isn’t good we have the power to improve it. That’s what we can control. Why not appreciate the sound of your friend’s kid laughing, it’s pretty great! I feel silly for taking this long to realize that it’s silly to feel silly, nay, I feel good that I have found the right formula to keep head in the clouds while keeping my eyes forward. Note: I’m not “cured.” Bipolar disorder fucking sucks. I basically wake-up every day not knowing what my body chemistry is going to lean me towards. Depressive hell or manic hell. Maybe I’ll feel kinda normal today? Whatever that is. I start from zero every day, and many times behind that line. But for me, having a road map of what to focus on, being able to write it out like this to reference again in the future can help me appreciate my days much sooner. Note #2: I didn’t proofread. If there are spelling or grammar errors, don’t be a jerk. I don’t care. If you have questions about the context or nature of the post I’d be happy to chat about it :) I do a lot of things.",2017
How to fight depression and anxiety,"As the head of a martial arts centre, there is a lot of pressure to appear perfectly confident and poised at all times. This is what is often expected of a professional martial artist.​The motivated, positive and confident exterior is of course not always a true representation of what I am facing inside. I am human just like everyone else. We all struggle. Even those who claim that they don’t. In my life, I have faced periods of struggle, depression and anxiety and while I may not be a trained psychologist or counsellor, I have had to play these roles in my own life from time to time. If you have ever suffered from anxiety and depression, you will know that logic and reason cannot help you to overcome these states of mind. You can’t reason with depression because at its most basic level, it is completely unreasonable and illogical. It is a black hole that can suck the joy out of everything that you once found enjoyable and leave you without the energy or will to get out of bed in the morning. So as an aside for those of you who are fortunate enough to have never faced depression and anxiety, don’t try to ‘reason’ someone out of it. It just doesn’t work. In addition, an argument designed to point out how illogical someone’s state of mind is could just end up plunging them further into despair. Why do we get depressed and/or anxious? If you search online, you will turn up hundreds of really good websites and articles which discuss this question. A good resource to look at is: https://www.beyondblue.org.au/the-facts/depression/what-causes-depression . My own perspective on the ultimate reason for the prevalence of anxiety and depression in modern society is that I believe that it is because our modern lifestyle does not match the lifestyle that we have adapted to live over hundreds of thousands of years. The lifestyle that we are most suitably adapted to involves living in small, mobile, tribal groups which rely primarily on hunting and gathering for survival. The changes to our lifestyle with the advent of farming, establishment of cities and the industrial revolution have been far too rapid for us to perfectly adapt to. The process of adaptation is very slow and while we have been very capable in adapting to the constantly changing face of our world, there have been side-effects and casualties. We can never go back to who we were before our world changed. This is a past which is forever lost to us. But we can move forward to a better future by acknowledging and understanding who we are and how we can adapt more perfectly to an evolving and imperfect environment. If you are experiencing anxiety and depression and come to a point where you can start to take control of the situation, try to introduce some elements of the hunter-gatherer lifestyle into your own. I don’t necessarily mean joining a tribe in the middle of Africa, although this could be a great experience. I mean doing things like spending more time outdoors in the bush, camping and bush-walking. Spending more time with your ‘tribe’ whether that’s family or a bunch of close friends. Hunting, if you’re into it. Listening to simpler and older tribal music. Eating simpler foods that you have prepared yourself. I think one of the biggest benefits of Paleo and other popular diets is that they require you to prepare your food for yourself from simpler, more natural ingredients. Of course, one of the things that our ancestors would have had heaps of in the past which is seriously lacking in our modern sedentary lifestyle is physical activity. There are numerous studies which describe the benefits of exercise for people suffering from anxiety and depression. A good fact sheet can be found here: http://www.blackdoginstitute.org.au/docs/ExerciseandDepression.pdf In my experience, a structured physical training program has been one of the most powerful weapons that I have used effectively against depression and anxiety in my own life. I have been actively following a dynamic, evolving physical training program continuously for about 30 years now. Aside from my professional qualifications, I suppose that my practical experience gives me some credibility as a fitness professional. When I first started training, the main pillars of my program were strength, endurance and combat. Over the years, the nitty gritty details of my program have changed, but these main pillars still remain. I’m not really interested in talking too much about the details of my training program because it’s personal. It’s private. A little Zen garden in the chaotic madness of our world. Over the years, I have relied on it for much more than just physical and mental improvement. I have often leaned on it heavily during times of great personal stress. In times of depression and anxiety, it has kept my head above water. It has broken me. It has mended me. It has changed me. It is at once as permanent as a mountain and as changing as the sea. It has been both a lover and an enemy. An intimate friend and a hard-nosed school-master. I have often found that these feelings are shared by veterans of physical and martial training. They don’t often share much about their training program. It’s just too personal. Conversely, the younger players don’t have as much personally invested in their training programs and are more likely to Instagram every single punch, push-up or dead-lift. For them, it’s all about how good they look, not about what the program is doing for them personally. If they endure for a few decades, things may change for them as well. I believe in the importance of a regular, structured physical training program for EVERY SINGLE PERSON. It is of fundamental importance to your personal well-being although you may not know it or understand why yet. I am writing this article to say that you need to start training if you’re not already. So how do you get out of bed and exercise when you don’t feel like you can get out of bed? At times like these, I have had to switch my brain off and just do it. You can’t reason with depression, so don’t even try. Just get up and get going. The more that you do this, the stronger your motivation to train will become. It’s all about fighting, isn’t it? The title of the article was how to fight depression and anxiety. So get up and FIGHT! Don’t think about it, just do it. It may not make any sense to you but it doesn’t have to.

Fear is out to get me,"The old anxiety is settling in. Or trying to. The insecurity. I don’t know if I can do this. The fantasies about running away, just disappearing. The irritation, budding into anger, of responsibilities piling on. When will it ever end? When will I ever get to exhale, to have a moment of peace? The knots in my stomach that come from striving every day to keep everything and everyone together. Every night I fear our bed will finally give up the ghost and crash beneath our tired bodies. When will we find the time to buy another one? Take all the books out, unhinge the bookcase, call the city services to take away the old sofa… We’re too tired, we can’t deal, and the anxiety grows. My mother wants to talk to me, something about some money she has saved, and I think about the time she won’t be able to take care of herself, and don’t want to think about it, and can’t stop thinking about it. My coworkers seem stressed and bored, what to do about it, how can I help them find the joy in the work again? I want to reach out to friends, open my home to them, but everything in me screams “oh please leave me alone, go away, give me just one day, just one hour to myself”. And outside it’s dark and cold and it’s raining, and I decide no, I won’t go running today, and then I feel guilty, because there goes another piece of the dream, another piece of the me I was trying to build. This is how the compromises start. First I skip one day, then two, and then I end up spending the weekend in bed, in stained pajamas, bingeing on some stupid show and stuffing my face with Cheetos. I’m not there. I don’t want to be there unless I want to be there, if you get my meaning. But the fear of falling into this hole of self loathing is slinking around me, like a wolf on the prowl. It wants to get me, and once the fear gets me, I’m done for. How do I stop being afraid of being afraid?",2017
Six weeks,"I’ve kept it quite under control, haven’t I? The cleaner’s been round regularly, I’ve managed to even cook for myself a few times. I think I managed to get away with it. These past six weeks, I’ve been home alone whilst my husband Will has been working in Austria. No big deal you might think, and sure, had it been any other year, I might agree with you and would not have been as worried about being without my designated plus one. However, I had just cause for concern. Just under 18 months ago, I popped along to see my GP to discuss symptoms of discomfort, an uneasiness, perhaps an unusually fast heartbeat, or some kind of esophageal disorder that was causing a lump in my throat? I left the appointment with a diagnosis of Generalised Anxiety Disorder. Definition of which is as follows… a psychological disorder characterized by excessive or disproportionate anxiety about several aspects of life, such as work, social relationships, or financial matters. It was absolutely not what I expected. To be told I had a mental disorder completely stunned me. I had assumed I would be leaving with a prescription for some kind of run-of-the-mill drug to alleviate my physical symptoms. To be told that it was all in my head, threw me. I felt upset about the diagnosis, as I couldn’t comprehend that mental health would be an issue for me? No, surely not, that was something that happened to other people, like the Mum in Stranger Things. I’m stable, I’m getting married, I’ve got a good life with great friends and family — she must have it gotten it wrong, I thought. Once I had moved passed that denial, I realised that for some reason, whether I could identify with it or not, my body was battling this daily ‘fight or flight’ response and generating so much nervous energy in my body that it was wiping me out. I was knackered, and I know that I needed to do something to address the anxiety. Shortly after that appointment, Christmas 2015 came about and myself and Will were off to Disneyland Paris. From that trip, through to the following June, when we got married — and for some unexplained reason, my anxiety just unexpectedly disappeared. Like magic. So just like that anxiety became less of a concern and more of a blip in the system — a bit of ‘brain flu’ I thought of it as — and I moved on with life, enjoying marriage and the honeymoon, and feeling positively glowing with my 2016. I can’t identify what may have prompted anxiety to return late last year, but it did and it did in a major way, with my first ever panic attack in October. So many people battle anxiety and mental health issues day in, day out, for many many years — but being the kind of person that I am, having experienced this panic attack and dealing with the return of generalised anxiety disorder (GAD), I was losing patience already. I kept thinking to myself things like: “I don’t have time for this! I have a job I need to do and concentrate on, and this is holding me back. Can you just find a way to fix this please Joe?”. Life got in the way, and things got really busy at work, and I just didn’t have time to focus on trying to deal with anxiety — and so because of that, it was just always there, underlying in my day to day communication and giving me heart palpitations, shakes and sleepless nights. As we got closer to Christmas last year, the impending doom of Will’s six weeks away for work at the start of 2017 was playing on my mind. Not only did I know that I needed to focus on understanding my anxiety more, but I would need to adapt to living alone for a period longer than any time prior in our relationship. I was a bit scared to be honest, that I would be dealing with some potentially unpredictable lows, or periods of panic on my own — but I was determined to nip this in the bud, in my usual impatient way. I’ve had weeks now of reading up on anxiety, listening to podcasts, watching YouTubers talk all things mindfulness, keeping a journal, meditating — you name it, I’ve given myself a crash course in tackling anxiety. One of the things I tried out was ‘online therapy’, my thoughts of which I shared with The Observer here. It didn’t quite work out as hoped but was worth a bash. I’ll save my full account of the trials and tribulations of various treatments, therapies, rituals and habits for my inevitable memoirs (who knows at this rate?!), but let’s just say I’ve had my six weeks of attempts at self-help and I’m part handing over to a professional therapist from the end of this month. Oh and this Tuesday, on Valentine’s Day, Will’s returning home — so whilst I’m reflecting on all the things I’ve learnt about myself whilst having had the time to, and although I’m not anxiety free, I’d say I’m feeling well equipped to tackle this more over the months to come.",2017
"Accessible, empowering and rooted in everyday life","Learning to identify signs, triggers, talk openly and offer/receive the right guidance around mental health are skills that haven’t been universally taught. The idea that this hasn’t been part of school curriculum or embedded into a workplace culture sounds surprising when said aloud but the fact is, it hasn’t. Essentially what seems obvious but what has been glaringly missing is the need for prevention and early intervention through developing people’s insight into mental health as a matter of course. This can and will be achieved through accessible mental wellbeing education and a cultural shift away from mental health being a taboo subject. The UK government has recently been very vocal in this regard and with a goal of making schools and workplaces more informed regarding mental health, let’s hope their actions match the rhetoric. Whilst, progressive companies and projects such as MHFA, Sanctus, Self Esteem Team and Thrive NYC are some of the stand outs helping ensure progress is being made.",2017
Learning to Live with the Stress of Business,"One of my clients recently told me that his company had been bought out and the new management was changing all the rules about how their business operates.

How to calm the storm within,"I recently came across the suggestion that if you want to get a taste of what meditation is about, instantly, you can try the following exercise. When you’re feeling a difficult emotion like anger, anxiety or sadness, sit down and just say to yourself, or rather to the feeling, “Bring it on!” Focus your attention on what’s happening in your body and just let it happen. The image that came to mind when I heard this was of Lieutenant Dan in Forrest Gump when he’s sitting at the top of the mast during the storm. The rain is lashing down and the waves are rocking the boat from side to side, and he’s shouting “It’s time for a show-down — you and me! You’ll never sink this boat!” Our most intense feelings are the ones we most want to hide from. Mindfulness is actually a practice of feeling your feelings more acutely. When people don’t realise this, or think that it’s supposed to make them feel better straight away, it can really put them off. A friend who did her first very meditation with me said that she was never going to do it again because it made her feel her back pain, which before the meditation she couldn’t. Another said her anxiety felt stronger when she meditated, so maybe she should stop. It’s understandable. Of course we want to escape pain or discomfort if we can. But ignoring, suppressing or numbing emotions may sometimes work as a short term strategy — but, think about it, does it ever work for you in the longer term? If you ignore your back pain and keep doing what’s causing it, it’ll get worse. If you don’t face up to your anxiety, it might well self-perpetuate. But mindfulness isn’t just about feeling it more, it’s also about learning to be OK with it. To allow whatever feelings are there to be there. This, again, is a rebellion against natural selection, which has designed your feelings to control your behaviour. The stronger the perceived threat or reward, the stronger the feeling and the stronger the feeling, the greater the motivation to take an action will will help you pass your genes onto the next generation. Evolutionary biologist Georges Romanes wrote, ten years after Darwin, “Pleasure and pain must have been evolved as the subjective accompaniment of processes which are respectively beneficial or injurious to the organism, and so evolved for the purpose or to the end that the organism should seek the one and shun the other.” When you sit there and say “Bring it on” you’re throwing down the gauntlet to natural selection and saying “I will not be controlled by my feelings!” An Indian sage once said “There is only one question worth asking: what are you afraid to feel?” If the answer is nothing, then the world is your oyster. — - If you enjoyed this blog and would like to receive the next one, you can sign up here.",2017
There Are Hidden Dangers of Taking Anti-Anxiety Drugs,"You’re probably familiar with the benzodiazepines diazepam (Valium), lorazepam (Ativan) and alprazolam (Xanax). They’re among the most popular drugs worldwide, prescribed most often for generalized anxiety and panic attacks. Xanax has become the fourth most widely prescribed drug in the United States, and it’s no surprise. In a nation where anxiety is as prevalent as the common cold, these medications do their job. But there is a dark side — many dark sides — that should make you think twice before hopping on the benzo bandwagon. These drugs can be used safely, but the decision to take them shouldn’t be entered into lightly. Benzodiazepines stimulate the brain’s receptors for a chemical called gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), the major inhibitory neurotransmitter impacting anxiety, mood, sleep and pain sensitivity. The various benzodiazepines differ primarily in how fast and how long they act. They can decrease your ability to think clearly, impair memory and reduce your ability to respond to emergency situations that may arise (for example, if you are driving a car or operating a dangerous piece of machinery). These effects can be seen even in the lowest doses that are usually prescribed. In addition, a recent study found that the use of one of these drugs for at least three months increases your risk of Alzheimer’s disease by 50 percent. In high doses, benzodiazepines can cause life-threatening respiratory suppression or result in a coma. Since 2000, the number of emergency-room visits due to benzo use has doubled. When combined with narcotics, the risk and severity of these side effects is significantly increased. Yes. Their continued use downregulates the brain’s sensitivity to GABA, so not only will you need more of the drug to get the same benefit over time, your baseline state of anxiety without the drug actually increases. It can be very difficult to get off benzos once you’ve started them, and stopping can come with serious withdrawal symptoms. Insomnia, irritability, heightened anxiety, panic and restlessness are among the most common symptoms. More patients now end up in detox for the combined use of benzodiazepines and opioids than for all alcohol-related complications. Benzos can be effective in relieving an acute panic attack or preventing one in a high-risk situation. However, there are almost always better alternatives. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) like sertaline (Zoloft) and escitalopram (Lexapro) and selective norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) like venlafaxine (Effexor) and duloxetine (Cymbalta) are the first choice in managing generalized chronic anxiety in those patients who require medication. In the long run, getting to the root of the problem through cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), counseling and modifying your lifestyle to fortify your defenses against anxiety (getting proper sleep, optimizing nutrition and avoiding caffeine and alcohol) can have a cumulative effect that can lessen or even eliminate your need for these drugs. Applying skills learned in CBT or using deep-breathing exercises or visualizations (there are many mobile apps that make this convenient) can abort many panic attacks before they become unmanageable. And the more you practice and use these skills, the more effective they become. Source: http://lifebru.com/",2017
Temporal Lost and Found,"I was sitting in an airport lounge when I realized I was having a panic attack. It was not an unfamiliar place. As a consultant I find myself in airports a lot. I was flying away for a weekend of fun and relaxation. Even before I left home my face was tingling, like it was being poked by thousands of tiny nails. It was not painful, but it was not pleasant either. As I got ready to leave I began to sweat and my heart was racing. By the time I sat down in the airport lounge I was on the verge of tears. Tears that I could not explain. A woman sat across from me, on her phone, telling someone else about her trip to Puerto Rico to see her father. She had many strong opinions about his new wife. Well she had many strong opinions about a lot of things. Her upbeat, energetic voice grated on my nerves. I would have moved if I could have gotten out of my chair. I could hear a man across the room, his voice pierced the den of conversation and the clinking of bar glasses. He was going to Philadelphia on the 8:30 pm flight and he had been in the lounge since noon. The fact that I could discern what these two people were saying and no one else felt frightening. These two voices were like augers drilling into a part of me where something felt very wrong. As unexplainable tears began to flow down my face I stopped searching Google for panic attack symptoms. I texted four people. Two friends and two family members. In the end it was my sister and her fiance that got me through my first panic attack. Though it feels like it happened ages ago, even as a write about it, the emotions come flowing back. This time they wash up against a bulk-head of calm serenity. I acknowledge them and let them recede back into the mist veiled ether of my subconscious mind. Yesterday, during my panic attack, there was no bulk-head. Every worry, fear, and anxiety flew out into the ordered and efficient utopia of my consciousness. The affect was a feeling of disconnection. I felt I was losing my grip on “now.” All at once I was living out a bleak future, regrets of my past, and my inner voice was screaming “why is this happening!?” Like a crew on a bridge of a ship in a storm, nothing was working as it should. My mind was pure pandemonium. In the end it was a simple exercise that brought me back into “now.” As simple as it sounds, in midst of this encounter with myself, it was almost impossible. I had to start over again several times as a text from my sister led me back. I saw a lamp, gray hair, a chair, a light post, and a van. Up until I called those items out, I was not seeing them. It’s as if identifying them and telling myself I saw them made them real. I was getting a grip on where I was, and more importantly, when I was. I heard a pa announcement, a sportscaster on the news, the crinkling of the newspaper of the lady next to me, and a vacuum cleaner. None of these sounds were abnormal for when I was. I touched the wood of the windowsill next to me, the plastic cup with water in it, and the leather upholstery of the chair I was sitting on. I realized I was sitting in a type of chair I had sat in many times before. I know I’m at an airport, and I know I am ok. I had stopped responding to my sister’s texts as she kept texting me to ask how I was doing. “This is in your head. You are fine.” Was the last message she sent before I stopped reading. “I’m back.” The feelings did not vanish immediately. They came in waves of ever lessening strength. I looked down at my watch and an hour had passed in what felt like mere moments to me. It was time to board my plane. Once aboard, I collapsed into my seat and fell asleep. I felt like I had pulled an all-nighter at work after jogging a marathon. When I was a teenager working on my family’s farm, one of my jobs was to shovel grain inside large tanks called “dryers.” These dryers blew dry air over freshley harvested grain to dry it out before sending it to mills. The grain formed a large pile that had to be leveled off for even drying. We did this work with large shovels, by hand. In the summers it would be 120 degrees in the dryer. Even on the hottest summer day, exiting those dryers, the relative drop in temperature would feel cold and refreshing. That is how I felt as my mind returned to normal. Calm, serenity, and realization of when I was. I do not know what brought on this episode. I can point to any number of things. And upon reflection it was not the first time I had experienced symptoms like this. The tingling feeling in my face has happened at least once before. I’m left with a feeling of urgent introspection. By the time I landed the crisp dessert air and excitement for the weekend ahead eclipsed the memory of the episode a few hours past. Only as concerned friends and family reached out did I remember what had happened.",2017
Benzos on the NHS,"I got part way to the treatment I wanted from my gp. I wish I’d been firmer and gone for exactly what I wanted. It’s so sad that you really have to manage your own care even with what I consider to be a good gp. I’m presenting with severe anxiety and panic attacks and she asks if I want to up my SNRIs. This would probably take weeks to make a difference if it would make a difference. I’m already on the dose where beyond it you see diminishing returns. And right now my brain is already active enough, it needs to relax not switch on more. I wish the NHS were better at mental health. Benzodiazepines are what got me out of crushing anxiety 6 months ago, they turned my entire life around. I can feel my anxiety is at the levels where I’ll slip back into being that ill again and I’m trying to avoid that. I’ve always been responsible with them, never become addicted, and responded super well. A week of three a day and then a second week of two a day and a third week of one a day would tackle this way better than “here’s 7, take one only when it’s really bad”. It’s really bad. It’s awful. I need to get my levels down and keep them down long enough to reassert myself. At least I got a script for benzos, just not a very big one.",2017
Overcoming Stress and Anxiety,"To overcome stress and anxiety you need to internalize three important beliefs: First, realize that the most difficult challenges usually lead us to achieving our full potential. The adage ‘no pain, no gain’ is sometimes true. When faced with a challenging situation it’s important to see it as an opportunity to grow. Take time to determine what you can learn from the experience that will help you in the future. One of my clients said that he now accepts feeling overwhelmed as a normal state of being. Feeling overwhelmed is impacted by how we use our energy. Our energy is proportionate to the resistance it meets. Second, don’t define yourself by your failures in life. It’s important to release negative feelings about failures, learn from your mistakes and move on. Although you may not be where you’d like to be today, the truth is you will achieve your goals one day and the lessons learned from your failures will have helped you succeed as a leader. And finally, understand that in the end everything is going to work out just fine. Have you noticed this? No matter what happens to us things usually work out for the best. As leaders, we need to internalize these beliefs because people emulate us and we want to be the kind of example that shows others how to face challenges, learn from the experiences and grow.",2017
Purgatory,"Sometimes there is a dead feeling in me. Like there is nowhere else for me to go but here, and this must then be death. It is a temperature rising and hitting the top. I have to remember to breathe when I look in the mirror at a dead man that looks OK for being dead. The bathroom has no windows and the strip light is somehow flattering. The fan comes on with the light and has that same strained hum as cheap air con on a hot day. I can shake this feeling off, it doesn’t stay. I put my hands under the tap and the cold water doesn’t phase me. Last Friday we are crossing a road on a blind corner when a car arrives too quick and shocks and brakes as we stand and watch absently. Sometimes there is no way to move away from events. What is happening is faster than muscle, faster than emotion. I feel myself above it, protected, divorced from caring. The car stops just in time, and I don’t take a step back. The lady bangs on her wheel, mouthing something that’s lost behind the window. I wave my hand and walk on almost floating, thinking of events, specifically where they’re heading. We pick up some dinner from this place where the owner looks as tired as the watercolours on the peeling walls, and when we pass that very same corner on the way home, she says to me, it’s scary, we could have died. Maybe we have, I tease her. Maybe you are just a figment of my dead imagination. She laughs and we continue in silence as the street lights give off a transcendent glow. The key is turning in the lock when she speaks again. Well I feel pretty real, she says, walking through the door, happy with this certain evidence. We are home and I shouldn’t take it away but I can’t help myself as I smile and ask: wait, isn’t that exactly what my imagination would say?",2017
ACTING OUT,"Is it okay that people take you for granted just because you’re fragile and don’t know how to fight your battles, or stand up for yourself when you’re in a room full of people who are questioning your morality and your principles? No it isn’t. NOTE TO SELF: LEARN HOW TO STAND UP FOR YOURSELF What would you do if you were trapped in an abysmal sea of emotions with nowhere to go, while someone questions your integrity. You are an 18 year old girl who is dealing with a lot of psychological issues which include anxiety and depression. With every word that is thrown at you, your inner soul breaks, one piece at a time, and you feel claustrophobic. You explode! You do something that you rarely do because you know how it feels to be on the other side. You shout. You try to convey your emotions but instead you destroy yourself and something you once had:friendship. NOTE TO SELF: NEVER EVER LOSE YOUR TEMPER AGAIN Living with depression and anxiety is hard. Living with people who don’t understand what you have been through, and what you’re going through is harder. It’s been almost three years since I have stopped manifesting emotional pain as physical pain. When you keep everything to yourself, keep your emotions locked in, you are bound to reach a point where no reservoir is big enough to contain your sorrows. The pain has to come out to the surface but you fear vulnerability and opening up to people, so you cut. One stroke of silver stained with scarlet tears and you feel free. NOTE TO SELF: PLEASE DON’T EVER HARM YOURSELF AGAIN I know that I need to confront people. In an argument, I cannot be the one who always sits back and listens as people go and on about your flaws and “mistakes” you made. I black out when I start getting anxious. I can’t see or think. I can’t remember incidents or stuff that I said 4 months ago(which I decide to let go because holding on to grudges only makes me miserable and i have enough misery to deal with as it is) I just don’t know how to confront people. I can’t stand up for myself because I am too afraid to fall. I don’t know how to steer confrontations into a non destructive path. My anxiety never lets me try. You cannot explain what living with an anxiety disorder is like, to people who don’t suffer from it. They don’t understand. They often come to the conclusion that you are probably lying in order to cover up your “mistakes.” NO I AM NOT! MY ANXIETY IS AS REAL AS MY EXISTENCE NOTE TO SELF: GIVE UP HOPE. PEOPLE DON’T GET IT. STOP GETTING AFFECTED BY WHAT OTHERS SAY. CUT OUT ALL SOURCES OF HUMAN INTERACTIONS WHICH MAKE YOU REMOTELY MISERABLE. FOCUS ON YOURSELF FOR ONCE. YOU DESERVE HAPPINESS AS MUCH AS ANYBODY ELSE.",2017

Monday’s Mindful Moment — On Anxiety,"What’s coming up in your week you want to be sure you don’t lose sight of? Take this moment to be mindful of it and keep it tucked into your thoughts and actions each day in some way. The first symptoms appeared 20 years ago. The actual illness took about a year to diagnose. Ulcerative colitis. So began my 6-year odyssey in which the disease became progressively worse and, ultimately, led to major surgery to remove the diseased organs. As noted, this life-changing journey unfolded over the course of 6 years. And throughout there were many anxious moments. I questioned the reason why I was sick and why my body wouldn’t fight the illness better. Why did it happen just when I had finally reached a point in both my career and family life where I was happy and fulfilled? Ulcerative colitis caused many a sharp turn in my expectations, both personally and professionally. But moving forward with faith in the doctors, belief in myself and, most of all, the support of my family, I overcame the worst of what it threw at me. And I healed and moved on from it, step by step. This past week I went to Johns Hopkins for a procedure that is really a status check after 16 years since I had surgery. I was confident that I would “pass” with flying colors. I didn’t. As the doctor spoke I immediately felt the anxiety I had experienced years and years ago creep in and take hold. I won’t know my next step until tests come back so the anxiety is there every day right now. But I’m going to reach deep and pull up my confidence so it’s again at the ready. I will believe all will be well. This coming week I’m going to remember it’s about moving forward, one step after another and approaching each day with positivity about what is offered and what will come. And when the answers are here, I’ll take the course of action that is necessary. Anxiety? Sure. But, I’ve got this. I bet you would, too. This is my Mindful Moment for the week!

Eating to improve anxiety.,"Anxiety seems to be a growing problem these days, especially amongst young people. Various pressures — societal, economic, physical, technological, emotional, political — mean that people are being pulled in many directions, increasing their day to day anxiety and decreasing their ability to cope. When you add in increased alcohol intake too, it’s no wonder that anxiety is one of the fastest growing self-help categories. The good news, is that there are foods you can eat that can help ease anxiety. First a bit of science: serotonin (the happy hormone) is synthesised from an essential amino acid called tryptophan, which cannot be synthesised in the body. Eating foods abundant in tryptophan throughout the day can naturally help increase / balance serotonin levels and can have a positive effect on your mood and anxiety levels. So what foods are high in tryptophan? With all of these foods, go organic and free-range wherever possible. Almonds: A personal favourite, you can get the benefits through whole almonds, ground almonds, almond butter or almond milk. Buy organic and local wherever possible, as almonds are notoriously resource heavy during farming. Also, when you’re using almond milk, read the ingredients to make sure you’re not buying one with loads of fillers like carrageenan, oils and sugars. I like Plenish or Rude Health Ultimate Almond. Poultry: Poultry is generally high in tryptophan, however the winner in this category is turkey, which has the highest amount. This explains that happy feeling after feasting on turkey during Christmas dinner, right? Avocado: This wonder fruit (or is a vegetable?) is also high in B vitamins, which help convert tryptophan to serotonin. Salmon: The ideal choice is wild Alaskan salmon (which is also high in vitamin D!) to avoid the antibiotics and growth hormones in farmed fish. It’s very important not to go overboard with fish (my recommendation is 2 x weekly, maximum) as its goodness must be balanced with the realities of what fish are absorbing from 0ur very polluted water. Organic, free-range dairy products: They are also a good source of healthy fats and B vitamins. Pumpkin, sesame and sunflower seeds: These seeds are also high in B vitamins and zinc. Green tea and matcha: A new favourite of mine, they are both high in l-theanine, a calming amino acid that helps reduce stress. To get more bang for your buck, eat these foods with a carbohydrate food (i.e. fruit and veg, gluten free grains like oatmeal, buckwheat or quinoa), as they will improve absorption of tryptophan. Other ways to manage anxiety Vitamin D: Make sure to get enough vitamin D, either from the sun or a supplement during the winter. If you’re not sure what your vitamin D levels are, you can get tested for £25 from http://www.vitamindtest.org.uk Deep breathing: Taking a long deep breath, in for three breaths through your nose and out for three breaths through your mouth is a brilliant way to shift your nervous system out of sympathetic (fight or flight) mode, back to the calming parasympathetic rest and digest mode.",2017
"Don’t ignore Anxiety, Embrace It","Anxiety isn’t something you need to overcome, it’s something you need to listen to and work with. It’s there not because there’s something wrong with you but because there’s something wrong out there. And it’s doing its job perfectly by stopping you from doing it. The best way to overcome anxiety is to listen to it and try to work out what it’s stopping you from doing. Then stop doing it. Sometimes it means making hard choices. Took me 5 years to stop trying to ignore and overcome my anxiety. I have up an 85k a year job in the process and live on benefits. But I’m so much happier than I ever was. Now I’m learning to make boundaries and to stop people from crossing them. And getting rid of people who do cross them.",2017
Anxiety,"Anxiety is a sensation of overwhelming loneliness. When having an anxiety attack you are on your own, separated physically and emotionally from people, places, things. You retreat into yourself, and man does it get claustrophobic up in there. The walls of your conscious mind start closing in and you start to rely on unconscious biological reactions rather than rational thought. You may shake. You may burst into uncontrollable sobbing. You may slur or stumble over your words. You may have the overwhelming urge to push your palms into your scalp and scream just to find out if you can even hear it. You will feel destroyed. But the worst part is afterward, when you come back to your senses and realise that what just happened wasn’t normal, and it wasn’t OKAY. The confusion racks your senses and then the sheer exhaustion sets into your bones. This has been my experience with anxiety attacks. It may differ completely from others. It may sound like an exaggerated horror story to those who have never been unlucky enough to experience one. This is not a wake up call or a draw for attention. This is a shout out into the void that is the consciousness of all of those living with anxiety. It sucks. It absolutely sucks but we get through it.",2017
"On The Air That We (Don’t) Breathe, or Anxiety’s Alomorphy","When I write about writing, especially about the ways in which I deal with the act of registering words, I always denote that I use several notebooks to write down different things, such as my dream notebook, although I don’t use it very often — it’s hard to remember my dreams and when I do, they are always disjointed and meaningless images, so I end up just writing these dreams and not coming back to re-read them anytime soon. It turns out that yesterday, when I finished writing the dream I had had the night before, I decided, by chance and randomly, to re-read the dreams of the last weeks. As I expected, they are records that, for the most part, do not seem to mean anything to me, but I ended up noting a certain pattern in these dreams: in all of them, I find myself in a situation of going through a breathlessness attack, in different ways. In a dream from three weeks ago, I’m inside a dark house, illuminated only by the light of the moon that enters weakly through a window; I walk around the house calling for someone I couldn’t remember who when, in an impulse, I decided to look outside the window that illuminated the house, just to find an unknown man observing the place without looking at me, just standing and watching. I start walking again through the house, now a little more desperate and panting, and then the dream ends, or at least what I remember about it. At the entries of last week, there is a dream in which I find myself in the parking lot of my first school, a huge place that, in this passage in question, was crowded with cars, everywhere I looked I could see only cars; I ran around and screamed for someone who, like the man in the other dream, I didn’t really know who I was calling for, but as if in a labyrinth, I never got to the end of this parking lot and no one heard my calls. I made a note at the end of this entry stating that I had woken up scared and breathless from this dream in question. And then, yesterday, I found myself again in a place that, in a way, seemed to suffocate me in the face of a strange situation — I was sitting in the middle of a clearing in a forest, on a floor covered with dry leaves; the trees were gigantic and had several paths that opened among them, but when I looked up, its branches and leaves covered the view of the sky, allowing only rays of sunlight to illuminate the place. I spent the whole dream trying to get up off the ground and walk through the forest in search of a way out, but the fear of losing myself in the middle of those trees would not allow me to move. The atmosphere was damp with a dew emanating from the leaves, and gradually I began to feel myself pressed by an increasingly dense air, perceiving it more difficult to inhale. I woke up with the lack of air that, like I said earlier, is currently recurring in my dreams. As I read these dreams of mine, writing the latter, I realized that the feeling that apparently has taken over me in recent weeks, reflected in these moments of body’s and mental activity’s inertia, is of being under the effects of a chronic vertigo, as if something beyond my capacity prevented me from leaving the place where I am and this feeling was being transmitted to my will to exercise the little freedom I have. Let me explain: it is pure anxiety, in the most genuine sense of the word, that agony that afflicts us with everything and nothing at the same time, the despair we feel as if we wanted to save someone from a fire knowing that we will burn down with the place. I think that in these days we live, it is rarer to have someone who does not suffer from anxiety than those afflicted by it. Unfortunately, we are the rules. Insomnia and mental battles have become knowledge for everyone. I kind of got used to this state already, since I accepted my situation. What I have been experiencing lately, however, has been somewhat different from the anxiety with which I am accustomed. It is a more subtle and unfamiliar anxiet — not that we always know what causes this disturbance of the mind and heart, in fact the rule is not knowing, but generally we have at least the notion that an anxious seed in us had been planted. This time, not even the seed seems to be here, it is as if my state of mind had sprung, magically sprouted. And how do we fight magic if we do not even believe it exists? Ah, yes, of course: I, in particular, do believe in magic. But I never got my Hogwarts letter… The announced tragicomedy of modern man should cause me more horror than it actually does, but I am (as I ‘m sure many of you are) so busy in finding means to survive in the hardness of these concrete jungles, that everything seems more comical than tragic . I am probably amused because my level of despair has gone off the acceptable limits, but honestly, I rather have the capacity to laugh at misfortunes than to be lost in the pursuit of an unhealthy perfectionism that plagues the globalized minds and that hampers and ruins all the chances we have to be beautiful in our imperfections. The realization that I am not to blame for these anxieties — the chronic, the ephemeral, the inherent — makes me feel lighter as to how I deal with them, because here I can find certain faults in my being: from the moment I feel them, I become guilty if I don’t try to seek appropriate treatment — even if healing takes time, even if there is no cure, one must at least try. We are fish out of water fighting for our lives in an increasingly polluted, gray, smelly atmosphere. Sometimes we feel as if the more we are debating on the sand with the sensation of internal burning due to lack of air, the more impossible it is to imagine a solution to our near-lost life. Let us, therefore, be grateful to the “ecofriendly” tendency of modernity, because nobody wants to see any species of fish (or humans) going extinct. In other words: there is salvation!",2017
Kind Actions Help People Cope with Social Anxiety,"Social anxiety affects millions of people every day, with effects ranging from slight nervousness to a paralysing fear that keeps the sufferer at home. A recent study, published in Motivation and Emotion and cited by Teen Vogue, reveals that kindness goes a long way towards improving a person’s social anxiety. Social anxiety stems from fear — fear of embarrassment, fear of censure and judgement, fear of mockery and ridicule. Sometimes, the social anxiety disorder is rooted in past experiences, specific traumatic events that affected the person emotionally and conditioned the brain to respond a certain way. For example, imagine that a young girl is entering a new school. Perhaps something embarrassing occurs at school, and the girl is ridiculed and judged by her peers. The mockery continues for weeks or months. Even when the ridicule stops, the girl dreads going to school because she is afraid of doing something else to embarrass herself and bring on the ridicule. Her brain is conditioned for a response of anxiety and fear every time she attends school. Psychologists in Singapore and around the world have long known that fear conditioning can be gradually modified and sometimes even reversed with therapy. However, a pair of Canadian psychologists took that theory to the next level in a new study. The participants were all sufferers from social anxiety. They were split into three groups. One group did nothing to improve their anxiety, while another practised exposure therapy by entering new social situations. The third group performed various kind actions for others, such as friends, roommates, family members, or strangers. The researchers discovered that doing something nice for another person immediately lowers an individual’s social anxiety. By the end of the study, the group that spent time doing random acts of kindness enjoyed significant improvement and felt more at ease in social situations than the other two groups of participants. Consider an example. Jing Yi suffers from social anxiety, which is affecting her connection with clients at work. To counteract her anxiety, Jing Yi could start thinking of nice things to do for people around the office or at home. Being more thoughtful takes her mind off her anxiety, promotes a more positive view of the people around her, and triggers happy, grateful responses from the people she helps. Instead of being negatively affected by a social situation, she receives a positive experience — a reward that begins to counteract the anxiety and fear response. Of course, the response of the other people is key to the effectiveness of this therapy. Doing nice things for other people is an excellent way to jump-start your recovery from social anxiety; but you may need to take it a step further.

BREATHE,"After the holidays, I started listening to my Lionel Richie Pandora channel because something about winter and Lionel Richie connect with me. I have a point with this but if you know me, there is a tangent involved. Here is the tangent: Lionel Richie is underrated. Maybe it’s a shit ton of 80’s celebrities dying last year at a young age that got me to thinking about it but it is how I feel. The man can SING. And he is helping me get through the winter of 2017. He is helping me to Recently, I told you about having to wear an event monitor. I was having episodes where my heart was racing more times than not for two weeks before I finally headed into the ER. I was having them different times of the day but the ones that woke me up in the night scared me most because I was doing nothing but sleeping. I was asked in the ER if I had ever had a panic attack, after the EKG and most everything else was turning up normal. A panic attack? I don’t think so? I have always been what you would call “high-strung”. I get nervous easily, freak out about simple things, have strong reactions to almost everything. I was cast in the stage show Listen to Your Mother with a piece that I wrote about my “anxiety”. It was funny and relatable but I wrote it because it was nothing more than a piece about funny mom moments. I never really read the words I wrote. Until recently. I freak out more than not; I worry about, well, everything; I don’t handle change well; those close to me have to handle me at times with kid gloves. To be clear, I am not a monster to live with. We have a pretty great life for the most part. I’m just not able to enjoy it most days. So after the ER visit, I started thinking and we know that is NEVER A GOOD THING. Man, I hold a lot on the inside because I don’t want people on the outside to know how crazy I am. Until it builds to the point of overflow then I let it explode on those closest to me. There is no middle ground with me; I am either really happy or really upset. Then with menopause starting, it got worse. My husband said to me in December, “you are way more over the edge than normal” and it hurt my feelings at first because I didn’t know I was over the edge to begin with. Then on a car ride alone with Mike one day, I just started crying. “Life is just too real sometimes” I told him through sobs. I don’t know what it is about winter, but I always think about how life moves too fast. I think more than ever about my grandma who I miss so much; about my childhood which I also miss so much, which brings me back to Lionel. Sweet sweet Lionel. I remember hearing All Night Long at a school dance when I was in junior high school. I remember wearing a green sweater with an Oxford cloth shirt underneath. Lionel takes me back to a time when life wasn’t so real. It was just about boys, and wearing the right Nike’s, and music, and trying not to have zits. There wasn’t a constant stream of news, media, deaths of famous people. There wasn’t online bullying, Twitter, Instagram, cell phones. No bills, adulting, deadlines or inconsiderate people. What am I saying? There were inconsiderate people in 7th grade too. But you get the idea. Life was simpler and as I write this, I think of every generation before us saying the exact same thing. To which we would scoff and laugh and think “geezers…..” But seriously, The Limited is closing. My God what is happening to my childhood? *That’s like Forever 21 closing for you youngsters today. I JUST SAID YOUNGSTER. I have always been riddled with anxious thoughts here and there; mostly here. I would push them down inside and tell myself to get a grip. But I was never able to really get that grip, you know? There are days where I feel things too much, take rejection too hard, am unable to get over being hurt by someone. I hear other people say things like, “it will be okay” “you will be fine” “it’s all part of life” but in my mind, I don’t feel that way. I carry it with me every day. I remember years ago telling my mom that I felt like menopause was the “beginning of the end” to which she laughed. She reacted much differently to menopause; happy to see her period go, possibly because she went through it later than I. The beginning of the end. A few weeks ago I took off my heart monitor for the first time after 32 days and it was a glorious feeling. Feeling tied down to a cords and a computer is tough, man. Funny how perspective changes everything. I haven’t had a cup of coffee in over 30 days and I am slowly realizing that as much as I don’t want to admit it, large amounts of caffeine are not good for me. This is what is good for me though- venting; talking about fears instead of holding them inside. Crying is good, did you know that? A good cry sometimes helps more than a Xanax ever could. I am slowly learning to breathe. To not care what anyone outside of my body thinks of choices I make to ensure I am okay. To enjoy life more, exercise as much as I can, watch what I eat, not beat myself up for choices or decisions I make to ensure I am in a good place. I have blocked a lot of people on Facebook; muted a ton of people on Twitter; said “no” more and not felt guilty. It is a process but it is one I need to make in order to be a good wife, mom and friend. I just need to Originally published at www.agracefull-life.com on February 13, 2017.",2017
"Let Me Tell You How Things Got Better: Depression, Loneliness, and Victory In My First Two Years of College","I still think about those days. At times, I may appear lost in thought, my gaze turning to focus on nothing in particular, as I remember the time leading up to my freshman year of college at the University. Certain things I see in my day to day life will bring me back to that time and place, a part of my life that I would rather not relive, but nonetheless a part of my life I have come to accept as a lesson. I see it in the eyes of those who are touring the campus in the Spring; the smiles they wear as they are shuttled around, fantasizing about what college will be like when they are finally freshmen. I remember a lot; too much. I have changed in the past two years, and the Honors experience has helped me through times horrific all while leading me to a happier life. The Honors experience is a series of highs of various intensities, dependent upon how deep one is willing to explore their own consciousness. It was a beautiful day in the April of 2012. My friend and I were on the University of Maine campus, partaking in Accepted Student Day. I had known my friend, Steve, since my freshman year of high school. He was my best friend, and he had been rejected from his dream college, Dartmouth, so his next choice was Umaine. The University of Maine was the only college I had applied to, as it was the only one I was truly interested in. I had fallen in love with the campus and the chemistry program, so on this day in the April of 2012, the only place I wanted to be was on this campus. We were hopeful. We had come to expect from college that which we had seen on our yearly trips to Burlington, Vermont. I work at a social service which helps people with intellectual disabilities live fulfilling and meaningful lives. Every year since I was 16, I have gone with our Special Olympics softball team down to the University of Vermont, where they hold a softball tournament for all teams who wish to be involved. The teams consist of half people supported, half volunteers. Steve had volunteered with me on my first trip down. UVM is located in Burlington, Vermont, which I had quickly learned is one of the most beautiful places on earth. The tournament always took place over the course of a weekend. When the softball games would finish for the day (usually around 5pm,) the volunteers were free to do as they wished. It just so happened that Burlington hosted a nine-day “Discover Jazz” Festival, which ran through the weekend of the tournament. Some of the most beautiful moments of my life have occurred on those weekends in Burlington. I remember watching Lake Champlain reflect a pink sunset, as music filled the very air I breathed. The people in Burlington were all friendly. During the time my friend and I went to Burlington, we met many people going to college. They all seemed happy. We envied their sense of freedom and happiness, one we had never found in the state of Maine. We were excited to find liberation. My friend and I saw college as a road to freedom, one we would have to travel regardless of the quality of the path. So, on Accepted Student Day, we felt one step closer to happiness. We took the tour, we were shuttled around, we smiled, we were hopeful. We got our ticket that allowed us a free meal at the dining hall of our choosing, and we went to York dining. My friend and I sat at a table, eating our free food. He looked around and grew silent. Turning to me, he said, “College seems like a very lonely place.” I, of course, did not believe him, and I tried to convince him these will be some of the best days of our lives. That same day, we were able to sit in on an Honors class. Despite some of our hopes being dashed throughout that day, I knew, at that point, that at least the Honors experience would always be teaching me something I needed to know. In the following June, I was able to attend orientation. I was very happy then. Looking back, I realize how lucky I was that I was able to hear Charlie Slavin give his speech. He spoke of the “journey,” an idea that mystified me at the time. Before his speech started, I was blessed with the opportunity to sit beside a beautiful stranger. She had vibrant, curly hair, colored dark brown with streaks of reddish brown, which invoked feelings of Summer. She wore earth-toned jewelry and looked like she belonged in college. I introduced myself, or maybe she introduced herself, these things have a way of working even when there is no clear beginning. Her name was Rebecca. Charlie gave his speech, and I spoke with Rebecca about the implications behind the “journey,” what did it all mean? She was fluent in voicing her thoughts, it was nice. Here was this person I had only just met, and we were talking intelligently about something that mattered. This had happened few times before. The semester started, the good times were rolling. I spent the first month of my first semester meeting the members of my dorm, random people, and teachers. I had a friend who was a third year, and we would study every weekend for things that would be covered the following week. I was not in Rebecca’s Honors class, but that was alright. My Honors class was very friendly, and we were only slightly afraid of voicing our true opinions. I remember a groundbreaking moment in that class when we were discussing religion. I had brought up the idea that religion was not necessary for one to have morals, and I had also said that I was not religious in the slightest. A woman in the class had recently read Richard Dawkins’ The God Delusion, and raised some of the points found within. The preceptor continued facilitating the discussion, happy that we were speaking about things that were not particularly easy to talk about. I had felt that I had taken a great risk to come out as a non-religious person, a risk that had to be taken, and I remember the feeling of acceptance I felt when someone else was actually on my side on the matter. In high school, if I brought up the very notion that I was non-religious, not even bashing religion, if I simply said I did not affiliate with any religion, other members of the class would ridicule me. I knew that the religious type thought they were the majority, so they felt comfortable trying to scare me into believing by unsheathing whatever scare-tactic they felt necessary. I also believed that there were others like me, but that when they saw how I would get ridiculed, they felt scared to voice their opinion, so they would stay silent. That Honors class was what truly started to make me feel comfortable with voicing an opinion while not belonging to any “majority”. I started to feel comfortable with saying things that could provoke a response that disagreed with what I had said. I have found, at great expense and with such luck, an entry I wrote after my first semester of the Honors college. Our preceptor told us this entry would eventually help write the very paper I am writing right now. The following is that entry: “My dream has always been to be either a musician or a writer; anything that creates. The chances of me gaining employment from either of these endeavors is almost equally nonexistent, thus, they have continued living as favorite hobbies. My first semester in the Honors College has given me incentive to create. It has taken desire and turned it into necessity; I have to create. “Intellectually, a new drive has been instilled within me. From the first lecture wherein the Dean of the Honors College talked about the months ahead we would face as honor’s students, I had faith something would transform me as a thinker and as a person. The weeks that followed were crafted from dreams we would never wake up from. The seminars were consistently my favorite class. Some of my greatest memories of my life lay in the hands of philosophical debate and discussion with the ones I love. To be able to walk into a peaceful atmosphere every Wednesday was a great break from the constant hustle of college life. “My favorite book we read this semester was the Dao De Jing. In it, the very fabric of life was sown with the needle of peace. It did not punish the darkness for its existence, but instead appreciated it as much as the light. I contemplated with great apprehension whether I lived as the wind or the running water in a river. I still don’t know the answer to that question, and it will only be answered after my ending. “The message of Inanna was perhaps the most uplifting. It put forth that pleasure and hard work can go hand in hand; that empathy derived from helping others can lead to happiness just as much as any hedonistic pleasure. This message proved vital to handling the debilitating workload that is college. As reflected in the me we learn of what the Sumerian culture viewed as true happiness, which places truth, the art of straightforwardness, and the art of song with the likes of the cult prostitute. “The most psychologically interesting book, for me, was The Presocratics Reader.To read the first contemplative thoughts complete with reason was truly amazing.What we take for granted, the archetype mode of thinking, was a venture for the Presocratics. The greatest frontier to explore was the one inside our heads. “By Dr. Catherine O’Flaherty requiring one discussion response a week, I quickly became more consistent with my works. No longer were the times where a stroke of genius would be followed by a long line of disappointments. When it comes to all things real, I have always felt like I know what the perfect song sounds like, but I don’t know how to play the instrument. Disillusionment breathes life into sorrow, but what feelings are real and what ones I just think I’m supposed to feel are indiscernible. I feel I’m destined for great things, just as you all should, but it all comes down to what I do. By further expanding my conscious vocabulary I hope to find something; someone; hopefully me. The greatest thing I’ve taken from Honors college is this second step in the right direction.” (Circa December 2012). If the entry did not suggest it, I was very depressed at the time of its writing. I was very lonely. My first semester had been riddled with dealing with constant disillusionment. I had believed college would be like Burlington, I was wrong. I tried not to show my depression, so my friends did not know much about it. It was the Honors class that truly kept me going. Amidst all of my science and math classes, I viewed Honors as an oasis I got to visit thrice a week. I ended the semester with a 4.0 GPA and a lingering depression, thank God. The break between my first and second semester was spent being with family and writing songs. Depression is a funny thing, as you begin to live as a walking dichotomy. A part of me felt defeated. When I was not sad, I was beyond happy that I finally had a break from the sadness. In the break between semesters I recovered and felt excited to start my second semester. My friend told me the deeper sorrow digs into the soul, the more happiness it can eventually hold. The second semester started, and I felt ready. I knew that this semester’s Honors class was going to live in the shadow of the first semester’s class, but I still felt optimistic. I did not like the majority of the books we read in the second semester. Sure, I respected them all, but there were truly only two books that gave me new directions for this journey I was on. The first of which was Vitruvius’s On Architecture. Whenever I look at something intricate, I ask myself, “How the hell can that exist and not fall apart?” Reading this instrumental book on architecture lit a fire in my soul that made me question the nature of all things. I learned of how complex structures “work” with this text, and was determined to apply this idea to whatever structure I could find. I thought of societal structures, such as government and inflated egos. I saw my body and consciousness as a construct, the architect being the universe with an infinite pool of time. In an attempt to gain objectivism, I tried to distance myself from the structures I observed. I quickly realized all things in life have a set of blueprints lying around if one is willing to seek them out. These thoughts resulted in me actively fighting my depression. I had attempted to find the blueprints of my despair, and partially succeeded. I realized that everything I am, and everything I feel right now is a result of something I did ten minutes ago, an hour ago, a week ago, etc. that eventually led up to this moment. I saw that we exist as three selfs, the past self, the present self, and the future self. The present self is largely a product of the past self. Thus, the more you do things to make your present self and future self happy, the more your soul will feel happiness. I learned one has to be able to forgive the past self. After this great realization, I worked to cultivate happiness, but I knew it would be a while before the seeds I planted would sprout. So, the first half of my second semester was the worst depression I have ever experienced. The second half, however, I began to feel much happier. The proverbial “happiness seeds” were finally taking root. The second text that greatly affected me was Saint Augustine’s Confessions. Coupling this with The New Testament, I put forth the idea that “Christian Nations” are easier to govern and lead. This is because the Christian faith instills within the believer a greatly praised sense of passivity. Authority figures that claim to be Christians could easily take freedoms away from the believers, as there will be little resistance. I also spoke of what I would later find out was the idea of the “double-consciousness” within the mind of the believer. The believer has two sections of thought within their mind, always at odds with each other. First they have their own thoughts, whatever they may be. Secondly, they have thoughts that consist of how they think God would be judging them at that very moment. These two sections of thought create a chasm in the mind of the believer, partially debilitating their sense of reason in the process. It is the mind at war with itself, viewing the God thoughts that constantly judge them as a foreign entity when it is truly just projected thoughts. I wrote my long paper about these ideas, and it received an A. In the twenty years my preceptor had taught, there had been just two papers that had received an A, my paper being one of them. Though I had aced the class, I did not enjoy it much. It was too analytical. It bothered too often with questions that had answers. I was not interested in those types of questions. My first semester had dealt with philosophy; creativity, whereas my second semester focused on reality. The class was akin to me drinking carrot juice. I do not enjoy carrot juice too much, but there comes a time when you need to eat, erm, drink*, your vegetables. You do not especially enjoy it at first, but as you begin to reap the benefits of drinking the carrot juice, you start to enjoy drinking it more and more. The class, like carrot juice, let me see into the darkness that was analytical thought, a darkness I had not peered into much before that semester. What was important was that I had searched for meaning in that class, and that I had found it. Summer was in the air. To accurately portray the impact the following year of Honors college had on me, I must give a small background on myself. I have always been very self-conscious. At a young age, I started to think about what thoughts themselves were. I grew fearful of the passing of time. I felt at odds with society. Many things that society heralded as truths did not make sense to me. I could not make sense of war. I could not make sense of why we have people starving in this country yet we do not spend money trying to feed them. We spend billions upon trillions of dollars on war, but if we try to spend any money actually helping people, there is no room in the budget. Killing is easy, understanding is hard. I thought about all of these things through elementary school to high school. I simply could not make sense of it, something was missing. I saw my third semester as a breakthrough in trying to understanding the conflicts I have had with society and my own thoughts. When I read Sidereus Nuncius by Galileo, I was inspired by his wonder towards the universe. Bacon’s The Great Instauration proved to me science was about discovery, not ego or money. Marx spoke of capital and our disdain for the poor. Suddenly I realized all of these thoughts I had been having have actually been thought about for 40–300 years. I felt solace as I read these texts, as I had previously believed I was alone with my thoughts. The class was filled with amazing, respectful, respectable people. In this class setting we discussed the ideas in the texts, and many of my inner turmoil was settled. It was Rousseau’s work, in particular, that made the most sense to me. I remember thinking that our only hope was to live in accordance with nature and to be skeptical of any man who claims to understand man. Those who claim to understand man are but merely given by their society the illusion of understanding. Rousseau states, “What is even more cruel is that, since all the progress of the human species continually moves away from its primitive state, the more we accumulate new knowledge, the more we deprive ourselves of the means of acquiring the most important knowledge of all. Thus, in a sense, it is by dint of studying man that we have rendered ourselves incapable of knowing him.” (Rousseau 33). Men are naturally good. Only when studied under the lense of a corrupted society is man given the name of self-interested barbarian. We must not get so caught up in studying virtuous traits that he forgets to practice his natural virtue. Man’s happiness with life should come unadulterated from within the mind. He should be proud to go skipping through the park with his daughter; overjoyed to kiss the love of his life in public view; brimming with excitement over whatever he finds solace in doing. The constraints of social expectation cannot choke man’s will to be happy. Society is there to better each member individually, whilst collectively ensuring their rights to those freedoms. Rousseau writes, “What good is it to seek happiness in the opinion of another if we can find it in ourselves? Let us leave to others the care of instructing peoples in their duties, and confine ourselves to fulfilling our own duties well. We have no need to know more than this.” (Rousseau 21). These messages truly resonated with me. I no longer felt like an outsider by feeling self-conscious and being frustrated with society. I learned that it was quite normal to be skeptical of many of the things that are perceived as “truth”. I sought to understand the nature of the questions that had always riddled my mind, and in doing so I realized though I may never have an absolute answer to these questions, I can still live peacefully by seeking to understand these questions better. I had had Jamie Elwood as my preceptor that semester, Rebecca and I had become best friends, and I passed Organic Chemistry with an A-. For the following semester, I chose the Honors class that worked best with my schedule: Hon 212, TuTh, 2:00–2:50pm with James Gallagher. I saw only two familiar faces in that first Honors seminar of my fourth semester. I asked them, “What is Jim’s class like?”. They replied that the class was very writing intensive, and that as long as I paid attention and dedicated my time to it, I would get through the class. “Good.” I thought to myself. I had promised to myself that I would get as much as possible out of Hon 212. I was happy. It is amazing what you can accomplish when your brain is not constantly lying to you, telling you you’re not good enough. I had figured this class would be much like my Hon 112 class, very writing intensive while focusing on answers. What I got, however, was nothing like what I had expected, yet somehow I had felt ready for it, prepared almost. Jim spoke early on about the idea of the “judge” being inside of your head. The Judge is the voice in your head that seeks to define whatever you are currently experiencing or creating. The Judge is what you believe other people will think of what you are doing. When you have pretty bad anxiety, the Judge can ruin your life. In my first few papers for the class, it was much like the Judge and me having a dialogue. When I felt strongly to move a paper in one direction, the Judge would destroy the notion and take control of my writing. I love writing, yet the Judge would lead me to believe that writing was a chore, and that it could not be enjoyed. I took a break from writing a paper every week and spent time gathering my thoughts and my voice. The classroom environment was objectively beautiful. We had all gone through three semesters of the Honors seminars, so we all had a pretty good foundation of voicing our thoughts. It was much like the feeling when you, an experienced musician, play with other experienced musicians. I learned from Jim’s brutally honest, yet understanding, way of thinking. I noticed everything Jim said had an undertone of deep admiration for the discussion at hand. It was much like talking to someone while watching a sunset together, this constant undertone that everything was ok; that everything was alright. I had quickly come to love everyone in the classroom, in one way or another. Also in the class was a man named Eric Arnolds. He was constantly wanting to think about things in a new way. He was open to criticisms and he was very loud, but above all, he was interested. No matter what topic was at hand, he was interested in it. I learned a lot just by being around Jim and Eric. By the end of the semester, we had all grown immensely as people and as thinkers. I had read Robert M. Pirsig’s Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance, which has helped me along this “journey” we’re all on. As for the Judge, I made damn sure I was enjoying what I was writing with everything I wrote. Much less inhibited by the Judge, I have found a sense of peace. As I write this, the sun is shining in through the window. … “Do you know where I want to be?” “No, I don’t. Where do you want to be?” “Right here, right now, in this moment…I wouldn’t change a thing. What a hell of a journey we’ve been on.” … I walk out of the room where I have just taken my second to last final. It is one in the afternoon, the sun is beating the grassy mall back to life. All is right. Rebecca and I have planned to get lunch before she takes her last final tomorrow and then heads back down to her family in Old Orchard Beach. I walk outside, squint at my phone, dial her number, talk for a minute, and then find her sitting on the mall. As the end of anything approaches, you suddenly realize all of the potential that something held. You may grow regretful, wishing you had done more than what you had. However, in this moment with Rebecca in the sun, I feel no regret. We eat, talk, and laugh. Eventually I hug her and say goodbye, and then hug her again. This Summer, my friends and I will take trips down to see her and meet her friends and family. She symbolized hope to me. She was also the opening act to my Honors experience, and it is only right to have her be in the conclusion of my two year Honors’ sequence. All things come full circle. - E.P. 8 May 2014 … Looking back and deciding to publish this again, I have learned that education is perhaps one of the best counters to depression and ailments of the spirit. This was written in 2014, and since then I have found that books (specifically memoirs/autobiographies) and podcasts (in particular Ted Radio Hour and This American Life) have completely reshaped how I view the world and myself. Perhaps I will write a piece on this idea in the future. -EP 2/14/2017 Photographs were taken by Stephen Roberts, Jr., my best friend.",2017
Self Love,"No, I don’t mean masturbation, although that’s cool too. I’m talking about loving yourself enough to be kind to yourself. For as long as I can remember I’ve hated myself. Now, don’t all rush to tell me that I shouldn't, or that I’m worth more, or worse still mistake it for a need for positive attention, because as much as I appreciate the comments, it’s probably futile. Saying that I hate myself though, probably isn’t completely factually accurate. I, like most people, am a mass of contradictions. I think I’m funny but if I’m around people I don’t know very well I’ll be too shy to risk cracking a joke. I think I’m intelligent but if my views are questioned I quickly start to doubt my own thoughts and opinions. I think I’m nice but I constantly wonder if the kindness is somehow self-serving. I hate the way I look yet I post unedited pictures to social media. I think I’m a good friend yet I worry constantly about failing the people around me. It’s never as cut and dry as it seems. Lately I’ve been trying to cut myself some slack, and to push myself outside my comfort zone. A week ago I went out in a crop top and danced like a fucking idiot and nothing bad happened. I posted a picture of myself in a swimsuit online and nothing bad happened. I went to a comedy gig wearing lipstick and laughed freely without trying to hide my teeth and NOTHING BAD HAPPENED. Not only did nothing bad happen, I had a bunch of great experiences and a tonne of fun. Now, I’m not suggesting that none of it was hard, because it was, but the ends justified the means and made me realise that my own self perception through the unforgiving lens of body dysmorphic disorder has become so warped over time that I truly can’t trust it. If that sounds like a major breakthrough it is and it isn’t. I’m being kinder to myself but I still haven’t given up the obsessive teeth cleaning/checking, I’m still addicted to watching denture vlogs and when things are really bad I occasionally research a myriad of surgical procedures. While I haven’t given up on the idea of physical self improvement I’m starting to accept the way I look now and stop policing my own happiness by obsessing over it so much. One day at a time.",2017
500 Brains In Twelve Months,"For over a decade now, a big part of my day-to-day life has been the issues I’ve had with mental health. It has affected how I feel about myself, it has impacted my work, and it has, at times, put strains on the relationships I have with those people nearest to me. Whatever the cause, the effects are easily observable. Last year, I decided to take matters into my own hands, once and for all. I referred myself to a Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT) specialist and started on a journey of understanding what’s going on in my head and what I can do to take back control. After 12 weeks of CBT and having started a course of anti-anxiety medication, I’m now feeling the best I have in over TEN YEARS. But, I know that there are many others in the UK and beyond who haven’t even started on this journey. And that for every one person who is directly affected by mental health issues, there are dozens who will be indirectly affected through friends and family. It is with this in mind that I set my goal for the next 12 months (March 2017 — February 2018): To talk to 500 people, in real life, openly and candidly about Mental Health and what we can do to help ourselves and each other. Five-hundred is a big enough number that it can be difficult to imagine just how many people that is. So, I’ve put together a graphic showing 500 brains. It’s a graphic I’ll use to keep track of the number of people I’ve spoken to — hopefully, mostly at events in the tech and business worlds — along my 12-month journey. I’ve already coloured in a few of the brains, to symbolise those I speak to already. This is what 500 brains looks like: My goal is to colour every single one of those brains purple by the end of February 2018. Through a mixture of networking and, hopefully, talking to people at events. I’m currently planning how I can work with local Mental Health charities and organisations to make sure my message is helpful and to get the ball rolling. If you’re running an event and would like someone to come along and talk about Mental Health, especially if your event is targeted at the worlds of technology and business, get in touch. I’d love to discuss what we can do together to spread the word about Mental Health and make a better world for everyone’s brain. Icon credit: Brain by Arthur Shlain from the Noun Project.",2017
The Cure for Fear,"I shared this last night via the vlog which I thought was important to capture here as well: The point is to go do something, go act. Get out of your head for a moment. Go talk with someone, go for a walk, exercise, grab something to eat… but for the love of all things holy… don’t just sit there and do nothing. Go get help. Help comes in many, many different forms. Sometimes it’s professional and sometimes it comes from within. Sometimes it’s just a phone call away. Or, perhaps reading a book. I don’t know what it is for you, but, for me, it’s mentally and physically moving. At least, that’s where I start. Originally published at John Saddington.",2017
Let’s just assume…,"Meredith Arthur Feb 14, 2017·3 min read Valentine’s Day is about love in every shape, size, and form. Better than the cheesiness we’ve been sold, isn’t it? Bearing that in mind, here’s a short love letter where I tell you what’s really happening around these parts. It’s been a weird couple of months filled with ups and downs. The most viral Bevoya story to date happened a couple of weeks ago. Professor Lakoff’s initial response to the virality was stressful. I really admire him. I decided to embark on the first-ever Beautiful Voyager t-shirt sale. When the shirts landed, seeing everyone together was amazing! Then a crazy thing happened. Because of it, I was forced to confront my inner customer service avoidant demons. (Silver lining: the shirts are now on sale again for only 10 more days, so if you want one…now’s the time.) A wonderful first-time writer shared his story of learning about how his mind works after leaving a career in professional baseball. Is it possible to earmuff the news for a specific period of time? How do you earmuff dinner party conversations? You guys. Getting to write to you — and for you — is an honor and a privilege. Thank you for being my Valentines. p.s. Would love to see your favorite “animals snuggling” shots as responses to this post if you have the energy for it! It would be the best Valentines thread ever.",2017
"B and the Terrible, Horrible, No Good, Very Bad Day | Mx. Moireabh on WordPress.com","I’m in a huge ass writing block right now. The stress of which has finally become physically taxing, and I’m writing the intro to this crying in a bathroom stall minutes before I have to go to a class I’m almost sure I’m failing (but actually: not failing at all, I just got super fucking stressed out). So here’s me trying to list some of the things I have piled up in my head that seem (at least in some capacity or another) to be in the way between where I am now and where I need to be to be focused even enough to write the 3 assignments I have due this week. Good fucking fuck. Disclaimer: I’m doing this as a free writing exercise, so some or all of this will make little to no sense. Beyond that, as always, I should hope that I get a general disclaimer of “my opinions may change” oop 1: 2: Today is Valentine’s day. Last night I spent about 2 hours (and here I’m misusing the term) hyperfocused on this article about a crux of Lacanian and feminist pedagogy. Personal fave moment: Feminist pedagogy invites teachers and students to conceptualize relationships to knowledge and learning as contradictory, conflicted and emotional. If we understand classrooms as crowded spaces, then we can begin to understand learning as involving intense personal attachments and relationships to the world. (165) Now the above article is (obviously) an early foray for me into pedagogical thought [1]. For a long time I outright avoided conceptualizations of myself as a teacher or student because ??? it perhaps seemed too far outside my realm of consciousness? As a high school dropout, and the first member of my immediate family to attend university the labels never seemed to fit. As a third-year undergrad I’m now far more comfortable with the terms, but conceiving of where I fit within those paradigms both within the bounds of my university and beyond still occasionally seems perplexing. Now add to this that I’ve started feeling out grad school (and beyond, holy fuck) options and… honestly I can maybe see where my writer’s block/stress/anxiety/inability to concentrate is getting compounded. To shift gears a bit: as someone who really doesn’t need to try all that hard to “feel” the practice of relationship anarchy I cannot believe that I didn’t figure this out/look this shit up earlier. Though I’m not a teacher in a professional sense, I do believe that we’re all teachers to the people around us. And finally I think I’ve got a thread of how to reconcile my love for others with my role/s as teacher, student, facilitator, friend, reader, orator, etc. I have long felt ashamed for my love of others because in a very real way I feel very tightly the rigid constraints of when, how, to whom, etc love is acceptable: We are meant to care for our friends (but not at the expense of love), love our family (but not too much), love our (monogamous) significant other (with all our being), and aschew gazing too deeply into any/other relationship bonds we may have with others. Fuuuuuuuuuck that. 3: Social Constructionism and Interpellation // Intellectualism // “Eventing” // ????????? 4: I’m a smart and capable person. This is frankly shocking. I don’t know what it will take to fully conceptualize this within my frame of being, or really if I ever will. Anecdotally I feel as though people often describe the experience of inadequacy in the light of or possibility of success as a “disconnect” of experience, but for me there is absolutely no disconnect happening here: I am both a bumbling fool and a pretty dang great student/explainer-y person (as shown here) congruently. 5: I’m so scared of being forced to eat my words. [1] Though I did look into other articles on Lacanian pedagogy, and without discounting anyone’s experiences outright I have Concerns.

Quitting Coffee,"I knew the moment was bound to come. Cutting coffee is on most lists of recommendations on how to reduce anxiety. I knew that if I was going to address my anxiety, I had to come face to face with my entrusted side kick and break the bad news. So why is my first step in reducing anxiety literally the most difficult one? As I always say, why punch someone in the gut when you can punch them in the face, right? Coffee and I have had a short, but nonetheless endearing, relationship. I was raised Mormon, a religion and culture that celebrates many things, none of which are coffee. Aside from loving the smell of coffee, I was ok with not being allowed to drink coffee. The fact that you can’t miss something you don’t know exists (in a sense) helped. But then, I stopped believing in Mormonism (which calls for its own post). Once Mormonism stopped being true, god, all of the sudden, didn’t care about whether I drank coffee or not. And thus began an era. I started with Starbucks bottled Frappuccino and worked my way up–iced coffee, specialty lattes, hot coffee with lots of cream, hot coffee with a little bit of cream, and finally, black coffee made in my french press. I’m by no means an addict. I fill my thermos up in the morning and sip it through early afternoon. Sometimes I’ll take lunch at a coffee shop and get black coffee in an in-house mug. I’ve always liked how I felt with coffee running through my veins. I like the focus and motivation it gives me. But I can’t help but acknowledge that my daily coffee likely contributes at least a little bit to my anxiety. Maybe not enough to affect my anxiety, but I’ll never know until I take a “coffee break.” It’s been four days since I had my last cup of coffee. And I’m still alive. I know, I know, I only drink like 1.5 cups of coffee per day–not a big deal. And I am also drinking green tea in its place. Baby steps. I’m still in the honeymoon phase, but I do feel calmer. More tired, less motivated, but calmer. Stay tuned.",2017

redefining “self care.” the handy guide for rejuvenation when you are struggling.,"I’ve never been a fan of the term “self care.” It reminds me of college, focusing on ADL’s (activities of daily living), helping people into the shower, to re-learn how to do simple task solo. This is what I think of when I hear the term “self care.” I don’t deny that there are cases when dealing with mental illness that self care can suffer. Obviously, not showering for weeks on end does mean that your self care is suffering. This is similar for not eating, not sleeping, not doing those basic things your body needs for survival. There are plenty of people who struggle with depression and other mental illness who still keep their self care on point but continue to struggle to feel like they are doing more than surviving. Being a single parent and running a business full time means that I have often fallen into this category. I’m raising a child. We obviously eat around here, go to sleep at appropriate times, get outside and go on adventures regularly, we bathe too! Surprise. Do I eat breakfast and lunch when she’s not in the house? Do I not sleep at night & take naps during the day so I can make it through the evening? Is it sometimes really hard for me to get through an evening without snapping at this small kid who never stops talking to me her incredibly tired mom? Also yes. So I’m compiling a list. The handy “self care” list for those who think they do a pretty decent job at taking care of themselves but probably fall a little short on loving themselves. Shower in the dark. Wait till the kid(s) or your partner is asleep. Start the shower, turn on calming music, keep the lights off. Stand in the water. Just stand there. Let in fall over you, focus on the sound it makes as it hits the floor, focus on the feeling when it hits your skin. Close your damn eyes. Focus on the water, focus on the steam, focus on the sounds around you. Embrace the dark, dammit. Get some hats. Great thing about hats. No need to brush your hair when you’re running out the door. I’m not saying “don’t brush your hair.” I’m saying, when that’s 10 minutes you don’t have…throw a hat on and move on with your day. No one knows. It’s magic! Sing in the car. Really. Sing in the car. LOUDLY. Don’t like your singing voice? Turn the music up so you don’t have to hear yourself. Are you a little frustrated? Put on the angriest music you can think of (No joke, my angry music is Lit. It’s embarrassing, let’s not talk about it again). Feeling like you need some happy in your life. Jock Jams. Want some soothing love filled junk? Ingrid Michaelson. BOOM. For every other feeling I would just suggest the Hamilton Soundtrack. Eat pho. I know this just sounds like some millennial based BS. And I’m over here like… Have you had pho? It is the most comforting food you could ever put in your body. Are you sick? Pho. Are you hungover? Pho. Feel sad? Pho. It’s a back rub in a bowel. Visit an Asian market and get a seasoning packet. Or order it. Try a few different places. Eat it. Explore. This is going to be one of the harder items on this list. Generally I feel like doing exactly nothing when I have two seconds which isn’t taken up by work or parenting. A couple weeks ago I got together with another mom & her little (see the next point) and we hiked around the park on one of the most perfect winter days. It was warm(ish) there were no bugs, we hiked up a hill full of mud, we came back home dirty. It was strangely cathartic. I don’t consider myself all too earthy. Feeling connected, enjoying the scent in the air, the feel of the ground underneath my shoes, it was all new. Surround yourself with good people. There are a lot of these people. I bet you know some. I know a lot of good people. The older I get the more fantastic people I get to meet. Some of them — the ones I’ve met since being a parent at least — became my friends after breaking through my super socially anxious barrier. Those people are rock stars. Recently I’ve done my best to break through my own socially anxious barrier because the worst thing that can happen is…they don’t like me. If they don’t … so what? Join groups, introduce yourself first, smile at baristas, ask them how their day is going too. Put good things into the universe Sweatshirts. Soft. Comfy. A cuddle in clothing. Self affirm. I take zero credit for this. This is every other article I’ve read + my therapist (thanks, bro). I’m bad at this. I can be a regular negative nancy sometimes. It’s really hard for me to say “shit, I did a good job.” It’s REAL hard for me. But, we all do things worthy of praise. You should be proud of yourself, especially when you struggle the most. After all, you’re still here doing the work & that’s something, that’s a big thing. Swear. Seriously. Say fuck every once in a while. Let it out, dammit. Stub your toe? Pissed off at some stupid thing someone said? It’s alright. No one is listening. Even if they are listening. Why do you give a fuck? See, see what I did right there? Ain’t nothing wrong with a “shit” escaping your lips every once in a while. Laugh. Even if only a bit. Things are funny. Parks & Recreation — Funny. Santa Clarita Diet — Funny. Amy Poehler’s “Yes Please,” Rob Dircks “Where the Hell is Tesla,” and so on. You get it. Find things that make you laugh a bit. Memes can also be great. Tell jokes. Laugh till you cry. etc. etc. Find your people and tell them to make you laugh. Laugh till it hurts whenever you can. Alright, here comes the last one. This is the hardest item on the list. Tell people how you are feeling when you feel it. Honestly, most of me 85% of the time is like FUCK THIS. But I’m working on it. It’s always better to share…But I’m not totally there yet. So…I’m going to go ahead and leave this without much explanation. I think it’s pretty self explanatory either way. Wellp, you’ve made it to the end. If you take nothing else away from this post. Trust me on the whole sweatshirt thing.",2017
"De a poquito, como el fuego","Y de vuelta me consume esa ansiedad obsoleta inútil que no sé para qué viene y por qué no se va. Porque es así me consume de a poquito, como el fuego me va apagando primero con pensamientos feos después me quita el aire, de a poquito como el fuego. Me saca las ganas se me apoya en el hombro y me apaga, me tira. Después, cuando sucumbí a sus encantos me encuentra en la cama me mira de frente se ríe de mí, en soledad y desesperada. Ganó ya no respiro y no puedo pensar que todo va a estar bien porque no lo está. Ganó, de a poquito como el fuego. Pero cuando se da vuelta para irse victoriosa, yo manoteo el aire siento el aire entrar y de a poco lo llevo a mis pulmones. Lo siento en el cuerpo y dejo que se expanda de a poquito como el fuego y con ayuda de sonidos, chasquidos y golpecitos voy sobreviviendo (¿o superponiendo?) a aquel infierno llamado ansiedad, hasta que desaparece de a poquito como el fuego. Cada tanto viene de vuelta a veces mas seguido a veces mas fuerte pero son raras las ocasiones en que la detengo a tiempo. Mi amada soledad mi amada ansiedad qué sería de mí sin ella quién sería yo sin ella ¿sería normal? ¿sería otra?

Misophonia: The Indescribable Raging Urge To Murder Anyone Who Chews Too Loudly,"“What were you saying?” I ask through gritted teeth. I’m trying hard to listen as my friend recounts his weekend over breakfast. But as he crunches into another piece of (seemingly never ending) vegemite toast, an overwhelming feeling of rage surges through me. When I start to hear the sound of the sourdough moistly rolling around in his half-open mouth, God help me I want nothing more than to grab the chair he’s sitting on and smash it over his head. No, I’m not a violent criminal, nor am I in anger management. I merely suffer from misophonia — a condition where people are consumed by intense rage, anger or disgust by everyday sounds. I take a deep breath, fiddle with the table and try and tune out the deafening sound of him eating. It feels like he is literally millimetres away from my ears, chewing directly into my brain. Can the neighbours hear? Surely, they must be able to. He swallows and relief washes over me. I tune back into the conversation and smile. He reaches for his tea. Oh no. Please no, please don- Sluuuurrrrp. “OH MY GOD” Recently coined and largely unstudied, misophonia is only just being recognised by scientists around the world. It can be triggered by a range of sounds, from “mouthy” sounds (that I so detest) such as chewing, eating, lick smacking or slurping to other sounds such as sniffing, throat-clearing, knuckle cracking, nail clipping, tapping, pen clicking or even humming. The feeling these sounds trigger is difficult to describe other than irrational, overwhelming rage and desire to stop the source or flee — flight or fight. On Reddit, it’s aptly named “the urge to fucking murder someone”. Other accounts describe it as “indescribable rage and agony”, “the urge to swing at the people I love the most” or “excruciatingly unbearable”. Here are some of the most common triggers (courtesy of Radio National). For those sufferers, try not to punch clean through your laptop. When I initially heard about the condition, the first thing I felt was a wave of relief. For years, I had half-joked about my hatred of people chewing, but was secretly terrified by this secret dark side — the apparent desire to murder my friends and family whenever they chewed too loudly. One of the most frustrating things about having misophonia is the “incredulity factor” as Dr Lerner coined it — how incredible it seems that no-one else around you is getting upset over the same sounds. “How is this not physically destroying every fibre of your being?” But like most things, it exists on a spectrum. Luckily for me, it rarely bothers me apart from the occasional loud chewer in a quiet environment. The worst thing I’ve done is walk out of a room or beg my friend to please-for-the-love-of-god stop eating her deafening chips excruciatingly slowly in the movies. For others though, it’s seriously debilitating. There have been reports of people leaving jobs because of panic attacks in open plan offices, or people having to wear earplugs and constantly move carriages on public transport or even permanently eat in separate rooms because of the noise of their partner chewing is simply too much. For some, it is an ever-present problem plaguing them in most social scenarios — something that deeply horrifies me. One case from an early study found one person had even considered suicide. The condition is new to the scientific world though. Until very recently, scientists remained highly skeptical of the condition, merely believing some people were a tad over sensitive to annoying sounds. But they soon found that while everyone is annoyed by loud chewers, those with misophonia were alone in their extraordinary fury. A recent study in Current Biology is finally piecing together the mystery though. They invited 20 people with misophonia and 22 people without it into the lab and played them three sets of sounds — trigger noises (eating, breathing, drinking water), normal irritating noises (screaming, babies crying) and neutral sounds (rain). When scientists played the sounds while scanning their brains, those with misophonia showed no difference to the control group when hearing normal irritating noises such as the baby crying. But when they heard their trigger noises, their heart rate skyrocketed and they started to sweat — a response not dissimilar to extreme anxiety. Interestingly, the trigger sounds also stimulated the anterior insular cortex — the part of the brain that joins our emotions to our senses. Some research has suggested that misophonia symptoms are linked to anxiety, depression or OCD, but the research was not conclusive. Other scientists have called for it to be diagnosed as a new psychiatric condition on the OCD spectrum — although other scientists have called this ludicrous. Either way, there’s no obvious treatment either apart from learning to manage it. Some people resort to earphones or music or to simply leave the room. But one study by Monica Wu did successfully treat two patients using cognitive behavioural therapy — a proven form of psychotherapy which helps patients manage uncomfortable or distressing thoughts. People have long employed “mimicry” where they chew in sync with the other person to drown out the noise. Another study found desensitisation therapy significantly improved 83% of sufferers. But the condition is still relatively new and scientists are still catching up, meaning many of the studies are merely observational. For now, just knowing others have it and it’s more than a mere quirky (and scary) character trait is a comfort for many. But for those who are battling with severe misophonia, there is definitely help available by going to a psychologist or psychiatrist. For me? I’ll just continue to kindly ask my friends to buy quiet snacks before we go to the movies. It’s for their own safety after all.

Ensure and Pedialyte saved my life.,"I spent the entire existence of my childhood eating away my sorrows. Luckily enough I had great food to choose from, being from New Orleans allowed that luxury. Not that the choices were the best, but in NOLA flavor rules health anyway, anyday. I was the kind of kid that would swallow their food whole or barely chew (kind of like a crocodile), eat undercooked meat, stale foods, and let’s not forget the candy. The light of my existence was candy. Once when I was seven or eight years old, I ate an entire bottle of Flinstones vitamins because I thought it was candy. Yes, in real life I ate vitamins that tasted like candy and could’ve possibly died of vitamin overdose. Just kidding. But anyways, I was a human garbage disposal and never gained a pound. I didn’t actually get to over 110pounds until after I was forced to get on the DepoProvera shot at the age of 16. Which honestly made my food cravings worse and more intense than ever before. 5 years later I was 130 pounds and still was told that looked like I skipped meals. Here’s proof: But they had no clue what skipping meals looked like for someone my height until my condition settled in. May of 2015 was the month my life began to change, I will never forget the first day I couldn’t swallow my food. I was eating a banana on the way to work and almost choked to death. I decided to write it off as the banana being too dense and spent the next twenty minutes breathing the clump in my chest down. It was the most uncomfortable feeling in the world, feeling each particle slowly drop down my esophagus into my stomach. And it only got worse from there be it chicken, rice, cereal, watermelon, or just plain water. It became more and more difficult to swallow them over the summer. To the point I would wake up, in the middle of the night, coughing up food and liquids that I thought digested earlier in the day. To the point that I would regurgitate them all. To the point that I told everyone I was vegan so that I would avoid the shame of having to eat in front of them. It slowly destroyed me. It made me cry. It made me weak. The luxuries of eating and drinking were taken away from me. Social gathering were avoided, friends were lost, and so much weight. I’d laugh it off most of the time, blaming on the vegan lifestyle and how New Orleans is a food desert, while screaming internal profanities. If you’re thinking for a second I didn’t eat or at least try, you are dead wrong. I was always starving. I was born a foodie. Every single day I would eat as much as I can, hoping that something would stay down or at least the nutritional components would absorb into my blood stream. Hoping that my prior amount of body fat hasn’t run out too soon. I was frail and tethering on the verge of death every single day, while putting on a brave face. My mask explored its full potential as I began delving into the world of modeling. I figured this is the ideal body type that they make most sample sizes for anyway, why not? I’ll tell you why, because each day only killed me slowly internally and now the responsibility of modeling knawed away at me mentally. And financially. I put up a brave face the next 3 months and got some modeling work done until I began feeling faint more than usual. This is when I said to myself “I don’t want to die from this”. I started to see doctors about it and describe my symptoms: They would do blood work, but everything would come up normal except a few things. Although, to them they weren’t at alarming levels to cause concern for someone my age. The first doctor that I entertained was G.I. doctor named Dr. Thaddeus Temple, he gave me Ensure Enlive after every visit. He would also always comment on my age and that I’m the only patient he treats who needs to take ensure that doesn’t have diabetes and is under 30. After two months of visiting him, he recommended that I see a therapist because the condition doesn’t seem to be physical. But the tightness in my chest was real, and most days the ensure didn’t stay down which is why I’m glad it was free. He was truly concerned, but also did not have the answers I needed. I dropped down to 83 pounds by June of 2016. I fought myself up back to the 90's by August and started to seek therapy. I did a good bit of research about antidepressants and the effects of appetite increase and weight gain. I then solidified my excuse by telling myself, “You’ve been dealing with depression and anxiety your whole life. A little therapy wouldn’t hurt”. But it did hurt. I was prescribed 50mg of Zoloft and it was added to the list of my worst experience’s in life. I’ll be honest after the first three days of vomiting excessively and barely being able to walk or move it got better. For a week the difficulty was less intense to swallow and i was able to keep almost all liquids down. And then it returned. Like an old friend who once betrayed you coming back to dig deeper holes. I continued treatment for two months, and decided to begin weening myself off of the government made drug. The weening process was torture, of course, but I had become semi-numb to the pain I experienced daily. Days that I didn’t regurgitate were celebrated and usually followed by 3–4 days of a closed esophagus muscle. I ended up in the ER one day because I was weak and couldn’t stop throwing up. My life stock of electrolytes, proteins, and nutrients were getting flushed down the toilet. This day changed my life, the doctor took one look at me after listening to my list of symptoms and said: “I think I know what you have, but we need to run a few tests first” I cried my first set of joyful tears since 2014. There was hope for a cure. He also mentioned I should accompany Pedialyte with my Ensure intake to replenish my electrolytes. I’ll never forget what the nurse told me as I was leaving “Calories and Electrolytes are all we need to survive, we don’t really need to eat food” The next three months, I went through the process of seeing if I had true “Achalasia” Achalasia is a rare disease of the muscle of the lower esophageal body and the lower esophageal sphincter that prevents relaxation of the sphincter and an absence of contractions, or peristalsis, of the esophagus. and not just “Dysphagia” Difficulty swallowing (dysphagia) means it takes more time and effort to move food or liquid from your mouth to your stomach. Dysphagia may also be associated with pain. In some cases, swallowing may be impossible It’s hard to tell the two apart without having these three procedures done. Leaving the hospital after the Endoscopy I figured it must’ve been a good day for my esophagus with them not finding anything. I proceeded to go to Smoothie King to try out my luck, switching the ice cream for sorbet, milk powder for almond milk, and the bananas for raspberries. Health conscious choices became my best friends through this time, because they put up less of a fight. Or maybe they just irritated my esophagus less. Nevertheless, I bing drank Smoothie King on my good days. The next day was my Barium Swalow test, I was terrified they wouldn’t find anything. As I walked up the stairs to the X-ray department of the hospital, I felt a sharp pain in my chest causing my entire body to overheat. Not again I thought, this type of pain was crippling. I found myself laying down on the lobby floor sighing in pain around a bunch of older patients that looked at me as if I was being too dramatic. I wasn’t. My chest felt was stinging and my body was too weak to sit up straight like a normal human being. The floor was my safe haven. The lady at the front desk had to get my ID and insurance card out of my purse and bring the paperwork to my floor hugging body. She dared to ask if I wanted to hold off on signing my consent to the swallow test. I signed it and curled back into a ball, in too much pain to cut or roll my eyes at the question. The technicians assistant came out with a wheel chair and helped me onto it, and proceeded to lead my pained body into the X-ray room. Now from my understanding, the barium swallow test is suppose to have four parts to test the flexibility of the esophagus. I don’t really remember them all because I was too busy failing the first test. The barium did as every other liquid would on a bad day, but this time I could see how small my esphogaus was at the bottom. I finally had proof that it wasn’t mental and my condition, as rare as it is, was real. The technician didn’t bother to do the next steps on me, it was clear my esophagus was damaged. But even with a X-ray proving the extremity of my condition. I still had to have an Manometry. I honestly shudder thinking back to my day in that room. The technician standing beside me exactly what she was about to do to me and how much pain to expect. “I’m going to take this tube and stick it up your nose and slowly move it down your throat and then down your esophagus. And then I’m going to need you to drink this liquid so that I can monitor how your esophagus muscles are working” “Unfortunately I can’t give you any anesthesia because I need you to be in control of your swallowing” I can still feel her slowly inserting the tube down my nose, that part wasn’t so bad it kind of tickled. The tube continued to pass my gag reflexes, and that’s when the problems started. It took everything in my being to relax it enough for the tube to pass through, but after that point their was no going down. None. I instantly projectile vomited through my throat and nose in the same instant. It was humiliating. I told her to take it out, she wanted to try again. I let her, and the same thing happened. I couldn’t go for a round three, my throats was sore and my body was now on the defense against that plastic tube. Good news followed as I was crying hysterically with snot vomit dripping through my nose. She patted my shoulder and told me, “You should be proud of yourself. I do this procedure to grown men and they cry like babies and won’t even let me do it a second time. You’re strong and you shouldn’t worry every 1 in 2 people can’t get the tube down, and those are always the ones with true achalasia”. It was final. I had a rare condition that affected 1 in every 100,000 people. Yay me! After the results were in, I was directed to see a Dr. Christopher DuCoin at Tulane Hospital. My surgical savior, he walked into the room with a wide smile and bright eyes. Cracking jokes to lighten the mood, and told me of his newfound engagement to his fiancé he’s known for 22 years. “He’s literally known her as long as I’ve been alive”, I thought to myself. The thought relaxed me for some reason, or maybe it’s the number 22. But I’ll discuss that on another story. He then proceeded to tell me I had two surgical options: I was relieved to learn that the POEM was a internal procedure. My young flesh was not ready for surgical scars just yet. DuCoin assured me that it is the most effective and I will be required to stay a minimum of two days in the hospital after the surgery. I was excited, my only request was that it be performed before my birthday on December 22. He assured that it will be done before then, and it would’ve been done sooner if he wasn’t getting married the following week. My soul was filled with hope again. I would be able to eat again. I could finally be a productive member in society once again. DuCoin walked into the room with his medical students postsurgery with the same charming grin. Now more tan and with an unkempt beard after his honeymoon in the Islands. He says, “Did you have sunflower seeds recently?” I tell him yes, two days ago on a salad. “Well I’ll tell you one thing, you definitely had achalasia. I spent the first 30 minutes picking sunflowerseeds out of your esophagus before I could even start the procedure” I cringe at the thought of the two day old sunflower seeds never moving, but I can’t help but laugh at his statement. My esophagus was clear and I would be able to eat soon. I spent the rest of that day doped up on morphine and using a breathing tube to get any access water out of my lungs. I faded in and out of sleep, while the nurses checked my heart rate almost every hour and kept asking how many times have I peed. The next morning after a post surgery X-ray. I was allowed breakfast, but it wasn’t what I expected. It was beef broth, jello, and water. Delicious. Am I right? I hesitantly sipped the broth and relaxed my mind of the fearful thoughts brewing. It went down, completely without any tension. I was elated. My empty stomach could finally process a meal even if it is only liquids. The next two weeks I stayed on a liquid based diet and soft food diet. By Christmas, I was ready to give the real food a try. The last Christmas holiday my uncle started a rumor in my family that I was anorexic, it was disheartening. But it showed me something about people. They fear what they don’t understand. It still doesn’t make it right for him to accuse me of having a real mental health issue that is not to be joked about or thrown around lightly, but I forgive him. I also forgive the friends that I lost, who didn’t love me as much as they pretended too. I also forgive the doctors who lacked the knowledge to help me. I also forgive myself, for not valuing myself enough in the beginning and settled for suffering. Thank you for listening to my story.",2017
High Alert,"I sat down on the therapist’s couch next to a little machine bubbling lavender-scented steam into the air and gave him my best “Look at how happy and okay I am!” smile (because, as everyone knows, the most important part of therapy is convincing your therapist you totally don’t need it. …Right?). He asked me why I was there, and even though I knew this was a pretty unhelpful way to begin the session, I told him the truth: that I didn’t know. It really was true; these days, I feel more or less…fine. Great, actually. My anxiety is under control; my insomnia has virtually disappeared. I’m stressed about various things, of course, but they feel like things I probably “should” be stressed about, like travel and mortgage payments and such. I only booked the appointment in the first place because the psychiatrist who I see about once a month to check in on my medication suggested it, and so while I paid for that day’s appointment at the reception desk I also scheduled a new one with his colleague. And then all of a sudden it was a month later and there I was: sitting in a therapist’s office and talking about feelings. Look, I’ve obviously been meaning to explore the idea of therapy for a long time. And I should have been doing it for far longer than that. I was six months pregnant with my daughter when I started pushing back against the belief system that I grew up with — the one that saw therapy as, essentially, medically legitimized whining — and started thinking that I might not just benefit from it…I might actually, really, seriously need it. There were years of buildup to this, of course — years of sleepless nights during which I spent endless hours wandering the rooms of my house, hunting for a magic something to silence the noise in my brain — but it was a single incident that finally pushed me over the edge. What happened was that my first book came out. And with it came a deluge — and I mean an actual hailstorm — of this-is-the-worst-book-ever reviews posted to my Amazon page. A couple of days earlier, as it turned out, Amazon’s moderators had taken down a couple of reviews that they had deemed personal attacks (which apparently they don’t permit as a matter of policy; you can say “this book sucks,” but you can’t say things like “Author X is a huge slut” — basically, you’re totally allowed to hate the book, but you have to stay on-topic about it). I expected my share of crappy reviews, of course, but when I saw that a couple of them had been taken down I started to panic…because that’s like Lesson 1 in Life On The Internet: do not try to prevent people from writing whatever they want to write about you, because all this does is piss them off in a major way, and then they will make it their life’s mission to prove that they CANNOT BE SILENCED. Basically: don’t feed the trolls. When these reviews were taken down — the day before I turned 33 — that’s exactly what happened. I spent my birthday in a state of absolute hysteria, believing that my life as an author (or as a writer, period) was over. Every time I clicked over to my book’s page (which of course I couldn’t stop myself from doing) I saw a new diatribe or ten about just how terrible of a writer (and a person) I was. Let me be clear: I get how the Internet works and by now have developed what I think is a relatively sane attitude towards “haters” and such, but writing a book had been my dream since I was four years old, and this particular incident hurt more than…well, more than almost anything I’d ever experienced. I couldn’t eat. I couldn’t sleep, not even for a minute. I felt like there was a huge crowd of people standing in a circle around me screaming FUCK YOU into my face over and over and over. So I called Yale (where we were insured while Kendrick attended business school) and booked an emergency mental health appointment for the very next day. The next morning, I dropped my son off at daycare and then drove two hours to New Haven to meet with a psychiatrist. She suggested CBT, but a weekly trip to New Haven didn’t seem possible to add to the trips I was already taking for prenatal appointments. I stopped looking at Amazon (mostly), the incident faded into the past, and my anxiety went back down to its regular (not-so-phenomenal, but at least not completely paralyzing) level. And then I gave birth and went on medication, and have been stunningly (well, stunningly for me) even-keeled ever since. So earlier today, when my therapist asked me why I was sitting in his office, I really didn’t know. Then we started talking, and he asked me what I was scared of. The idea that my career might fall apart and I won’t be able to support my kids the way I want to, I told him. The fact that the people I love might die tomorrow, and will die one day. The fact that my children are getting older every second, and here I am missing moment after moment after moment. “Why are you living in the future if it’s such a negative place?” he asked me. That one I know the answer to. I’ve known it since I was in high school, when I developed the belief that the only way I would do well on a test would be to convince myself that I had absolutely bombed it. And I mean depths-of-my-soul convinced myself; we’re talking tears and wailing and oh-god-my-life-is-over. That, I thought, was the only way to ensure that I would get a good grade. And get into a good college. And have a good life. This is obviously crazy, and yet I believe it still: that if I relax my vigilance for even a second, forget to identify every potential tragedy that might come my way…boom. That one slip-up will blindside me, and everything I’ve worked to build — everything I love — will fall apart. So I worry. I worry because it feels like a penance I can pre-pay to ensure my family’s safe passage into wherever it is that we’re going. I know that I can have a healthier, calmer mind. I know I deserve that, and that my family deserves it. And I also know how to take further steps towards achieving this: I have to learn to meditate. To be mindful. To exist in the present not because I’m being willfully ignorant about the harsh realities of life but simply because it is a brighter, more beautiful place to live. I know all this, and yet I’ve avoided therapy for years. And today, I discovered the reason why: I don’t want to learn how to do these things. I don’t want to get better. Because way deep down in the part of me that was built before I even took my first step in this world lies the certainty that if I stop being afraid, I leave the door open for disaster. “I really am fine,” I told the therapist. “I honestly don’t know why I’m here.” Except I do.

I’m taking anti-anxiety medication. Let’s talk about it.,"I’ve visited my doctor a few times over the past year for a series of related issues. The appointments eventually culminated in an interesting conversation on anxiety. Within the context of a discussion on anxiety, and following a quick-but-formal (and not free) questionnaire, my doctor said, “There are a few paths we can take to address this issue. But first, I’d like to know how you feel about medication?” How do I feel about medication? It seems like a harmless question, but it holds this underlying implication that many people are not cool with using medication to solve a problem. That’s fair. Why take Ibuprofen when you can move past minor pain and go on with your day, right? Or why take drowsy nighttime medication when a cold isn’t holding you back? But I think it’s more than that. Because within this anti-anxiety/anti-depressant family—be it SSRIs, SNRIs, NDRIs, SARIs, Tetracyclics, MAOIs, or Tricyclics (yeah, there are a lot of them)—there seems to be this cultural stigma. If I said “Yes” to my doctor’s question, and later took the first-in-my-life anti-anxiety pill, I would be crossing a line. Prior to that, I would have been a person who had to work with what they’d been gifted (in the brain department) to solve problems. After that, I would be part of a group of people who needed help in normal, everyday circumstances. It might feel a little like admitting defeat—like I can’t do it all on my own. But I said “Yes” anyways. And I did it for three reasons. I’ve been lucky enough to have met and befriended some amazing people in my life—people who have turned my world views upside-down, who have made me see normal circumstances in an entirely different light. One such person was a man I met about three years ago—a man who would eventually help me throw out all my preconceived notions about minor mental illnesses. I’ll be honest, before I met this guy, I thought minor mental issues were complete bullshit. My internal rhetoric probably sounded something like this: Oh really, you can’t get out of bed this morning? Yeah, right. And days you get up, you can’t stop washing your hands because they never feel clean? Come on. STFU, get out of bed, take a shower like a normal person, and go to work. But it doesn’t always work like that. Depression, anxiety, obsessive-compulsivity—they’re all real things. And once I took my guard down and had a real conversation with this guy, I learned all about how your brain can betray you even when you’re as strong as you can be. And that it can be really difficult to explain to people who haven’t experienced some mental issue. And sometimes you really do need to seek help. Yes, sometimes we need help. I am a firm believer in this. It’s something I tell my wife all the time. Sometimes you need help. When I originally drafted this article, my wife was at a friend’s house helping the friend install wallpaper (because, little did I know, wallpaper is a thing again). Her friend needed help and asked for it. I do this all the time. For example, I don’t get paid for writing, and I don’t have a publisher or an editor, so I ask friends or family for help when I want a second opinion. Asking for help isn’t bad—in fact, I find it a really important component of succeeding as a human. My doctor is awesome. He didn’t just ask me about medicine. He offered medication with the long-term goal of ditching it. He’s all about treating the problem now, learning what it’s like to start feeling normal again (so to speak), and then eventually weaning off it and using more natural devices to address my struggles. I like that. After beginning the medication, I decided to talk about it, having been inspired by my friend (#1, above) who was so willing to share the details of his struggle. I told my family (and as far as I know, I’m the only one undergoing this type of treatment), and I began sharing it with friends. And, much to my surprise, in the first six weeks alone, I came across three friends (in addition to #1) who have either taken similar medication in the past, or were currently being treated for a mental issue with medicine. And I’m sure I’ll encounter more as I keep talking. I needed help and I’m receiving it. If I want to talk to you about it, I hope you’ll listen. If you want to talk to me about it, I will listen. If someone wants to talk to you about it, please listen. And if you need help, don’t be afraid to ask. I’m pretty new to Medium. If you enjoyed this article, please help spread it by clicking the ❤. And if you really really enjoyed it, consider following me to keep up with all the nonsense that goes on in my head.",2017
Benzodiazepine Bliss,"There are millions of Americans taking benzodiazepines to change their reaction to stress, and I happen to be one of them. People love to discuss the implications of taking meds to control anxiety, and the (healthier) alternatives that could be tried. “Have you tried yoga? Eating gluten-free? Meditating? Calling your parents more?” I’m sure there are some well-intentioned sheep in that flock, but I feel like the majority just want to make you feel weak for needing chemical intervention to control your crazy. I’m here for everyone taking meds to live healthier, more productive lives. It’s not a meth addiction. It’s responsible. Explaining severe anxiety to someone who hasn’t experienced it is interesting. I imagine it’s similar to a woman explaining to a man what it’s like to have a vagina: Something they have no actual way of comprehending, try as they might. I can only speak from my own experience, and I’ll try to do it the best I can. Mild anxiety is tolerable: You feel a little uneasy in a social setting, are vaguely worrying about whether or not your job is a good match, that sort of thing. Severe anxiety is that rope-attack spell from Harry Potter that binds you until you can’t move. It doesn’t matter if things are going relatively well in your life. Anxiety makes you think about all the opportunities you’ve wasted. Are you really happy with your friends? Anxiety will tear those relationships apart. Feeling somewhat financially stable? Anxiety will ask you why you aren’t flying private with the Kardashians or living in a million-dollar beach house (All those Silicon Valley startup guys are, why aren’t you?). Your view of normalcy goes out the window. There’s an inherent role that social media and pop culture plays in all of this, but that’s not going anywhere. At this point, you’re probably unable to move, think, or even begin to think about your next move. You need pharmacological intervention. And that’s where the benzo’s come in. I’ve been prescribed Xanax, Ativan, and Klonopin in my short 22 years. I’ve also been prescribed a lot of other not-as-fun meds, but that’s a post for a different time. Each one is different: Xanax kicks in 15 minutes after you take it and lasts a couple hours, Klonopin can take a full hour to kick in but then lasts the entire day. Ativan falls squarely in the middle. Klonopin gets a bad rap for being habit-forming, and its well-deserved. After being on it for 4 months, I tried to stop cold turkey. Benzodiazepine withdrawal is not what anybody would call a “fun” or “freeing” experience. I was paranoid, shaking, sweating and generally back to my old anxiety-riddled self. I went back to my doctor, lowered my dose, and gradually got off it entirely. I’m now taking Ativan, 1 mg, as needed for severe anxiety. Sometimes I take two. Benzodiazepines allow you to take a step outside yourself and realize that although things are not perfect, they are generally going to turn out ok. Half an hour after taking an Ativan, a sense of general relief comes over my entire body in the best kind of way. It’s the state I do my most productive work in, and it’s been incalculably helpful with academics and my personal life. I used to resent any type of medication: “I should be fine with some avocado toast, some green tea, meditation, and the occasional 45-minute appointment with my shrink” I told myself. And I still engage in all of those activities, but meds give me that extra edge that I need to get by in this insane world. I doubt I would have passed all 5 of my classes last semester, and I doubt even more that I’d be on track to graduate by the end of next year (Which, given all that’s happened in the past two years, is a fucking miracle). It’s all about the benefits vs. the drawbacks. I’d rather be a little airheaded and forgetful. The alternative isn’t for me anymore.",2017
Self Diagnosis,"Because I can’t afford therapy Rachel and I were discussing relationships. I mentioned I was trying to sort through why I was upset about a recent non-relationship ending and put words to my feelings and thoughts. I was upset because the person I was whatever with didn’t consult me before ending our situation and didn’t even ask how I felt or what I thought about it. I felt powerless, manipulated, and silenced. During our conversation, Rachel, having an academic history of psychology, mentioned something about neurosis. And then I felt like my whole life made sense. Neurosis is an outdated term, now being replaced with anxiety, depression, etc, but I never felt those words explained my brain. Neurosis just clicked with me and I immediately latched onto the word and was Googling it all the while Rachel was still trying to talk to me. (#symptoms) Because though I do identify with depressed and anxious feelings, those words, to me, aren’t fully descriptive and don’t encompass Brain Lock. I’m going to use Brain Lock to illustrate and name what happens to my brain sometimes. This word I made up describes what happens when an idea comes into my brain and then takes over. I obsess, think in circles, nitpick, speculate, worry, stress, and can’t sleep. It’s like an idea puts my brain into a headlock and won’t let go, no matter how much I squirm or protest. While a current of thoughts runs through my brain, it feels like the edges of my mind are fuzzy, confused, distracted, and uncomfortable, like static. I also imagine it as an idea burrowing into the depths of my brain and festering. Festering and fermenting until my whole brain is seeped with negativity and I want to just remove it and rinse it in bleach. I don’t feel like this all the time, but I’ve obsessed in circles over a few things on and off for years, I go on thought benders for a few days, and sometimes these sensations last a few minutes or hours, like when I’m in a group of people and track who is speaking and how much and is everyone contributing to this conversation and should I say something to engage those who aren’t and am I making enough eye contact?! That’s why at the restaurant I wait at, my nickname is “Gabbatron 3000.” Because things out of place, things that are inefficient, and things that are slow increase that uncomfortable static and I end up doing a bunch of work with unnecessary urgency, like a robot. It’s why there was a point I wanted to cry during my first community college class. I couldn’t hear the professor well, people were talking for no reason, I was confused, and I was overstimulated. A Thought Catalog piece listed 15 behaviors of painfully neurotic people. I related strongly to 12 of them. “ You are absolutely certain that the elderly cat you are cat-sitting will inevitably die while under your care, despite your near-militant adhesion to its care rituals.” I pretty much wait around for the phone call that someone in my family has passed and though Tuna is in great health, I have already thought about her death. I think it’s better to try to be prepared for it, because who knows what kind of hellish spiral I will go down if it comes as a shock. “ You re-read an email the second after you’ve sent it knowing full well there is nothing you can do about it.” Yeah, I reread my emails, risky texts, blog posts, etc. at least a couple of times after I send/post them. To reassure myself. To speculate how they could be interpreted. “ You can’t seem to be at a great height without imagining yourself somehow accidentally leaping off the edge to your death.” There have been multiple times when I have cried because I was too far off the surface of the Earth and when I read the following quote I felt like the author was talking about me. “What is vertigo? Fear of falling? No, Vertigo is something other than fear of falling. It is the voice of the emptiness below us which tempts and lures us, it is the desire to fall, against which, terrified, we defend ourselves.” — Milan Kundera After I read the definition of neurosis and a few symptoms, my obsession with trying to figure out what happened in the whatever relationship made sense and also (mostly) went away. Because previously, I was obsessing over the social cues I missed, the words said and unsaid, how I felt, what I could and would do now, to be or not to be petty, etc. Suddenly realizing that it wasn’t my emotions, or pheromones, or social behavior, but my brain patterns, that were sending me into an obsessive, sleep-deprived spiral, made the social situation okay. It wasn’t his problem, it was mine! It wasn’t my problem, it was my brain chemistry’s! I still had felt powerless, manipulated, and silenced, that was my truth. But those feelings are now in a new context. Will telling him my truth result in anything positive? For who? Is he worth all that energy? What can I do something to transfer my energy elsewhere? I am asking myself different questions. Before, I couldn’t see the forest for all the trees. Now, there is more clarity. A solution, coping strategies I can implement. Now, I know it’s not just my moral failings. Now, there is an identity and strategies and support. My whole romantic life, or lackthereof, makes so much more sense now! My thought patterns and behaviors weren’t driven by love or lust, but by my misfiring brain! My interpretations were off! It also makes my familial relationships make more sense. I’m still unpacking my parents’ effects on me as a child and now. If genetics and environment play strong roles, well, my current way of being is not random or coincidental. Yes, many of these thought patterns and feelings are common. But I am still flabbergasted that not all people think this way. I can’t get over it. You mean people don’t do these things? They move on much more quickly and easily? They don’t think about how nothing matters and stress over everything anyway? Their emotions don’t swing from one extreme to the other? They don’t feel like screaming on a regular basis? They are well-adjusted? Content with things!? They don’t get caught up in the details and then to cope, keep everything and everyone at distance? They don’t want to constantly run from everything? THAT is madness. As I was watching TV today, I put my M&Ms into columns, as I often do, sorted by color and by how many of each I had. I thought, hey Gab, there’s a long way to go, but what a beautiful step you made, what a wonderful journey you’re on, and how many things you have left to explore.",2017
Gelas-gelas Surat,"Aku ingat warna kemejamu pagi terakhir kita bertemu. Kamu memakai hitam pekat tanpa corak lain. Warna yang melambangkan rahasia terdalam serta dendam tak terbalaskan. Warna duka. Warna langit malam. Setiap kali aku menemukan hitam di langit, di laut, di sungai, di batu, di antara tulip-tulip dan kincir angin, bahkan di dalam diriku sendiri, aku jadi ingat padamu. Kalau kamu masih di sampingku, apa hari ini kamu akan memakai pakaian hitam? Apa warna mata dan rambutmu masih hitam? Apa kamu berkubang dalam kelam yang pekat? Melarikan diri dari hitammu, aku pindah ke negara lain, menyibukkan diri dengan kampus, teater, dan kerjaan. Di depan orang-orang, dengan gagah berani aku menjawab, aku sudah melupakanmu. Kamu bukan siapa-siapa untukku. Kamu sudah mati. Dan semua orang memercayainya, kebenaranku yang mustahil. Bagaimana bisa aku lupa padamu kalau dalam tiap sendi kehidupan, kamu muncul dan menetap? Kamu berdenyut dalam tiap nadi, mengalir dalam darah. Kadang ada sedikit penyesalan, selama bertahun-tahun hidup denganmu, kenapa aku tidak mengambil kesempatan? Aku bebas datang ke kamarmu, aku tahu kamu tidak pernah benar-benar tidur. Aku bisa dan punya hak untuk meraih, menggenggam tanganmu. Aku bisa menyerahkan diri, aku tahu kamu tidak akan menolak. Tapi aku terlalu takut. Meski tahu bahwa kamu akan mencium ujung kakiku kalau kuminta, aku takut kamu menampik uluran tanganku. Aku menyesali kepengecutan itu. Hidup ini singkat, kenapa waktu kusia-siakan untuk membuat jarak, meyakinkan pesimisme? Tetapi di sisi lain, aku juga bersyukur tidak ada yang terjadi di antara kita. Kalau saja aku pernah cukup berani untuk naik ke atas ranjangmu, membiarkan ujung-ujung jarimu menelusuri tiap dosa yang tergerai menghias tubuhku. Kalau aku membiarkan dirimu menancapkan perih itu demikian dalam, bisakah aku hidup sekarang? Mungkinkah aku melanjutkan hidup tanpa hitammu? Atau … atau mungkin kita masih akan bersama? Karena katamu, kamu sudah janji akan menjagaku, dan kamu selalu menepati janji, setidaknya padaku. Tapi kalau terus-terusan bicara soal “mungkin” maka surat ini tidak akan pernah selesai. Aku membencimu. Baik dulu maupun sekarang. Juga selamanya. Aku ingat meneriakkan itu saat pertengkaran terakhir kita. Aku menganggapmu menyedihkan karena melindungi diri sendiri. Ya, aku tahu bahwa bagimu, aku cuma alat. Sarana yang kamu pakai untuk bisa bertahan hidup. Semacam sabuk pengaman ketika berbalap ria. Kamu membutuhkanku, tetapi tidak dengan cara yang sama dengan aku menatapmu. Kamu membutuhkanku dalam cara yang gelap, sepekat bola matamu. Kamu membutuhkanku seperti manusia membutuhkan pankreas. Organ yang penting. Tidak tergantikan. Tidak bisa disubstitusi. Kamu akan mati kalau pankreasmu rusak. Tapi apa kita bisa mengatakan bahwa kita mencintai pankreas kita? Tidak. Tidak bisa seperti itu. Manusia tidak akan menikah dengan pankreasnya. Itu adalah bagian dari dirinya. Aku ingat menenggelamkan wajah ke punggungmu setiap kali kamu menjemputku pulang sekolah. Aku ingat aroma keringatmu, aura pekat malammu. Jantungmu berdetak lebih kencang setiap kali aku mengencangkan pegangan—saat itu aku tahu kamu tidak akan bisa hidup tanpaku. Aku ingat waktu kamu memelukku erat suatu malam. Ada aroma darah di lengan dan kerah bajumu, tetapi tanpa memberiku kesempatan menyelidiki sumber aroma, kamu menyeretku pergi tanpa basa-basi, kembali pulang ke rumah. Aku cuma anak-anak, susah payah berlari mengejar balon-balon mimpi. Orang-orang mencemooh dan menjauh. Hanya suaramu yang meyakinkanku bahwa tidak ada salahnya mengejar balon itu. Dalam diriku, anak itu masih hidup. Tidur tanpa suara di pangkuanmu, merasa nyaman dan berpikir bahwa segala hal akan terus baik-baik saja. Yang paling mengagetkan kemudian bukan tentang kesedihanku waktu kamu pergi, tetapi betapa aku selama ini tidak punya sandaran lain. Kamu menenggelamkanku dalam kemanjaan. Kamu tidak mendidikku untuk hidup tanpamu. Kamu pergi dengan ringan tanpa tanda dan aba, padahal aku terlanjur percaya kita akan terus bersama. Makanya aku membencimu. Sekarang aku membangun kehidupan dengan susah payah, menyusun dari satu bata ke bata lain. Teman-teman bilang aku perempuan yang teguh dan hebat. Mereka iri karena aku bisa jadi istri dan ibu yang baik. Aku cuma menggeleng sambil tertawa. Aku tidak butuh versi orang lain tentangku. Aku bukan apa yang mereka pikirkan. Aku tidak akan jadi seperti itu. Aku akan jadi satu-satunya diriku. Aku tidak akan jadi melodi manismu. Mendengar itu, beberapa orang dengan wajah heran bilang padaku, aku jadi mirip denganmu. Saat itu aku merasa sedikit memahamimu. Apa kehilangan yang membuatmu mengenakan hitam? Apa kamu masih selalu berduka, sama sepertiku? Apa kamu juga tertawa saat orang-orang menghakimimu? Nama pemberianmu berarti hitam dalam bahasa Turki lama. Apa kamu berusaha mengidentifikasikan diri dalam pribadiku? Apa kamu cuma memberi petunjuk bahwa kita sama? Kemudian aku sampai pada satu titik. Ya, kamu dan aku sama. Kamu bukan siapa-siapa. Kamu tanpa identitas. Aku pun bukan siapa-siapa, tetapi di saat yang sama juga seseorang. Keyakinan diri ini kutemukan dalam malam-malam kontemplasi dalam hitam, dan aku berterima kasih padamu soal itu. Pertanyaan terakhirku adalah, apa kamu sekarang bahagia? Sebab, aku ingin bahagia.

On getting caught up in the little things,"And how to snap out of it! Whether it’s mantras or some tough love, getting perspective on problems is hard but so important in order to see through the chaos. Why is it so hard to see the bigger picture sometimes? Why does my mind wake me up at 4am and go through totally unrealistic and pointless scenarios? How does perspective zoom in an out the way it does? I watched a film about space the other day and at first I thought about how small my life is compared to all that space and the billions of stars around us and how all my little worries will get sucked into a black hole one day because they just don’t matter in the grand scheme of things. But then, I thought about all that space again and wondered whether we were indeed the only intelligent life form out there and that if we were, we must be supremely important and my little worries in fact reflected an important and unique thought process. You see, sometimes even thinking about outer space doesn’t give me the perspective I need to be able to focus on what’s important! What does, is somebody else’s absolute refusal to take my worries seriously. When someone who cares about me and listens to my worries being described as though they were crucial to the survival or the planet, their very concern and sympathy can sometimes exacerbate the little worry. Of course it’s nice to hear that someone else finds something just as stressful or awful as you do but what I need to snap out of it is someone who cares how I feel about it but doesn’t give a sh*t about the little thing. I had this situation this week and must have driven a good number of dearly beloved friends and family round the bend with my constant look of worry and discontent without being able to pin down the crux of any of the numerous problems swirling round in my head. It took one person to listen, consider and then condemn all of what I had just said as total nonsense for me to snap out of it. And as soon as I did, a huge weight lifted off my shoulders, the fog in my brain cleared and I felt physically more alive and bouncy. They were right, everything I had been worrying about was just periphery to something much simpler and actually not that bad at all. I see this pattern a lot when friends moan about the actions of their boyfriends or girlfriends. They might tell my how lazy their partner is or how his or her friends are annoying but when it comes down to it, if you manage to get to there, it usually turns out they just miss them or wanted to spend time doing something that couldn’t happen. Usually, it’s not something unsolvable or terrible and usually it just needs a little perspective to be able to see the real issue. My mantra this week is to: SNAP OUT OF IT! On the topic of mantras, I totally endorse them and believe they can work. I was once struggling in a job I didn’t feel good enough to do and kept getting scared I would be “found out”. My mantra at the time (thanks Mum) was to be: CALM AND CONSISTENT AND TRY MY BEST AT EVERYTHING I DO. I repeated it to myself several times a day for weeks; when I was walking to the tube station or going to the loo or buying a sandwich. Years later I asked someone what they thought my greatest quality was (I wasn’t fishing for compliments I promise but it was a nice little exercise to do, can’t lie) and they answered that they liked most how I was calm and consistent!!!! I have never identified with those serene calm and consistent people, hence why I had to make it a mantra so this was a big and wonderful surprise to hear that.

“She Knows You’re Not The Full Schilling”,"Finally, she knows. The only problem with this is that I am the full schilling. This was the unfortunate term used by my ex girlfriend, just weeks after we broke up, to inform me that her mother finally knows I suffer from panic disorder & depression. After 4 years of thinking I was just a waster, she finally knows the real reason I’ve been struggling to be productive in any way, shape or form. That term, like “a few sandwiches short of a picnic”, “not playing with a full deck of cards” and whatever else people use, are terms used to describe someone with intellectual difficulties. That’s not me. Intellectually I am 100%, but I do have a mental illness. While it was unfortunate and probably a bit inappropriate to use this term, I know for sure my ex realises that I am “the full schilling”. What is telling about it is that this is how some people do think about people who are mentally ill. Before I get all personal, I just want to say that I am not writing this as a pity party for me. Pity means nothing to me. I just want to be as real as I possibly can be about living with anxiety & depression. I have paid a huge price for being sick. That price is the most important relationship with the most important person I’ve ever had in my life. That’s not all it cost me but other things pale into insignificance compared to that. My anxiety started as a kid of no more than 4 or 5. I won’t delve too deeply into my childhood right now, but what I remember, vividly, is being told by my mother that if my father had a heart attack, it would be my fault. I would stand at the front door, crying, as my father went to work and would not sleep until he came home at night, which was often far later than a 4 or 5 year old should be awake. This is my first real memory of any sort of anxious feelings. That’s a lot for a kid that age to take on board and as a result I spent most of my childhood terrified that he was going to die. During my teenage years and into my twenties I suffered from bouts of depression and anxiety but I didn’t really realise what it was. I thought I was just moody. I now know that most of this time I was really only treading water . Things were never right. I had self esteem issues, struggled in social situations with new people & had hypochondria. I think my childhood played a huge part in me having these problems. I don’t care who you are, there is no way for someone who grew up with a mother as psychologically & emotionally abusive as mine was, to end up as a well rounded teenager or young adult. Luckily for me, my was father was an absolute gent of a man so having him around for as long as I did definitely negated some of the shit she dished out. The straw that broke the camels back for me and has led me to where I am now was burnout and an eventual breakdown in 2012. The cause of the burnout is an article in itself but in short, I was working 60–70 hours a week and sometimes up to 80 for around 4 years. 3.5 years into this I told them I wasn’t prepared to do that amount of hours anymore so the company began to turn the screw on me to get me to quit. Maybe I should have quit but I didn’t and they really got in on me. This is when I had a breakdown. I was out sick for 7 months before finally leaving the company. At the time I didn’t realise the severity of what had happened to me and how long it would take me to recover. I had met my ex a couple of years before hand and after a couple of years with her I knew, without doubt, she was who I wanted to spend the rest of my days with. So when I finished with that company I decided that it was a good time to go to college and get a degree and a career doing something I like. The whole thing thought me that being happy and having a good work life balance is far more important than having a fat bank account. It was a decision we both agreed on and decided that 3 or 4 years of not having a whole lot, but enough to get by, was the way to go because at the end of it I would pretty much have a guarantee of work in the field I was studying. I had a year to get myself better before I started college. As is often the way though, things didn’t turn out quite how they were planned. That year to get myself better ended up being a year of huge turmoil and I was technically homeless for a while, but still had a roof over my head. The house I lived in was repossessed by the bank because the owner stopped paying the mortgage and I couldn’t find somewhere I could afford. A few weeks after I was supposed to be out a complete stranger came through and offered me a nice house out the country that I could afford and where I could bring my dogs. That was the key, the dogs stayed with me no matter what. I was dealing with panic attacks, daily. In the barbers, in doctors waiting rooms, standing in queues, on buses & trains, in college, at airports, at home & in friends houses. I could literally have had a panic attack at any time or place and there were days I would have panic attack after panic attack, each one kind of rolling into the next one. I had to stand between carriages on trains with my hood up and headphones in so no one would see me having one. On buses there were only 2 seats I could sit in, down the back on the lower deck at either window. If those seats weren’t free, I either stood or got off the bus. There were many days I had to get on and off buses 7 or 8 times for what should have been an hour long journey. I would get the earliest bus or train every day so there was the fewest amount of people on them and to give myself time to get where I was going. Travelling from home the 7:15 or 7:45am trains would have left me enough time to make it to college for 9 or 10am lectures but I had to get the 5:40am one, just to avoid crowds. Nights I stayed in Dublin I had to get the 6:20am DART(commuter train) when the 8:20 one would do. The reason for all of this is that when I have a panic attack I sweat. Not normal sweating though, it is literally like I am standing under a tap. It pours from my head and is, to put it mildly, embarrassing. So I wore hats or hoods all the time. I can handle the pounding heart & chest pain, being light-headed or dizzy, chills, tingling or trembling because by and large other people can’t see those things or I can hide them, but when sweat pours from your head, there’s no hiding that. Panic attacks are not only taxing mentally, they are also extremely hard on your body physically. They are exhausting. So college ended up being a monumental struggle! Getting to and from college was harder for me than the course work, which says a lot because I was doing a BSc(Hons) in programming and they are by no means a cake walk. I got through 1st year and attempted 2nd year twice but both times I hit a wall towards the end of the year. I had to defer both times on medical grounds but was going to give it a third and final shot this year. A week or two before I was to start, I was told that the place I stayed a couple of nights during the week last year in Dublin was not going to be available to me this year. To be honest, at the time, it wasn’t really too upsetting because I was far from confident that I was going to be able to do it. The almost 3 years I did do were extremely challenging and I was absolutely exhausted, but I wanted to give it one more shot because I really didn’t want to let my ex down. She had supported me completely throughout the previous 4 years and I couldn’t bare the thoughts of her being disappointed. But as it turns out, that for her was the final straw. It took her a few more months before she finally ended it but she had lost all faith in me and I really can’t blame her. So this pretty much brings me to now. At the end of November I was dumped. Dramatic I know but that’s how it feels when it happens. I really had no reason to suspect it was coming. We had a 20 minute chat a couple of months previously where she told me some of her concerns but in the intervening months I did exactly what I was asked to do, so I thought we were good. I know now she probably wanted out then but when she started to do it, maybe had second thoughts or bottled out and rowed back. It can’t be easy to give up on someone and a 7 year relationship, but she did and life has to go on. She decided that her life would be better without me in it and that has to be respected. Relationships end all the time, people become memories and those memories fade over time. There’s no doubt I miss her and am still in a stage of reminiscing about all our good times but she has moved on with her life and is doing her thing. I do not have one bad thing to say about her. At the end of the day she was my best friend for 7 years, stood by me through thick and thin and is without any doubt, the most selfless person I’ve ever met in my 36 years. So whats the point of this whole thing? Its been said to me that it’s okay to be depressed but 6 months is enough time to get yourself right. That came from someone that I have a huge amount of time for, but obviously they don’t have a notion what they’re talking about. It’s an uneducated opinion and shows a complete lack of awareness. But this is a very common opinion. I’ve been accused of being lazy. More uneducated crap. Generally I find younger people to be far more aware than older people but I have friends who have straight up told me they ain’t the person to talk to about whats going on. Not everyone is comfortable talking about it and I can understand that. I also have friends who have really stepped up for me, particularly in the last few months when I’ve needed friends more than ever and I have friends who have distanced themselves from me over the last few years. But that’s just how things go, some people get it and some people don’t. Four and a half years ago I was earning €50k, driving a nice car, had money for holidays and whatever I wanted pretty much. Now I exist on €10k a year. Of that 10k I pay €4,800 in rent. Of the remaining €5,200 I spend€1,440 on dog food and €1,040 on electricity. €600 on phone and internet. I am on medication that costs me €15 a month and every time I go to the doctor its €55 but thankfully that’s only twice a year now, unless I get acceptably sick, ya know, not the mental kind of sickness. So that leaves me with roughly €35 a week for food and anything else that comes up. My shopping list is usually porridge, bananas, milk and coffee. I can only hope one of the dogs doesn’t get sick. I have 2 pairs of runners left, the sole has been fixed on one but is falling back off and the other pair have holes in them. I live 20km from my home town where my friends and one of my siblings are. I have no heat except for a stove in one room and I am just out of fuel for it. Wouldn’t of even had any if it wasn’t for my ex’s mother giving me some last year. I go to bed every night in a cold room and wake up wheezing every morning. I have no car. 3 weeks ago I didn’t see another human being for 6 days. It’s not usually quite that bad though. I spent Christmas Day alone but was brought some dinner that evening by a friend. I spent New Years alone. I am completely isolated and very lonely. There are many times over the last couple of years I’ve felt like ending my life. Christmas/New Year 2016 I was at rock bottom, there’s no doubt about that. I live the way I do because I’m lazy? Give me a break! But as bad as that sounds and I’m emotional even writing it, I do have things in my life to keep me going. I’ve got my dogs and I’ve got some hope. Obviously when you look at the numbers, I can’t afford 4 big dogs but they are what gets me out of bed every morning. Every day they get me out of the house for a few hours and if I didn’t have them, I’m not sure where I’d be. Others have given up on me but I haven’t given up on myself. I know if I can quiet my mind and focus on what I need to do, I will get it done and I’ll pull myself out of the hole I’m in. My anxiety is a lot better than it was a couple of years ago but the depressive episodes are a lot worse. It’s all about finding a way to manage things though. I’m looking forward now. Things can only go one way from here! If you happen to read this and you’re one of those folks who reckons people with a mental illness need to just smile, pull up your socks and get on with things, you’re an idiot! I am glad you got this far because I wrote it partly for you guys. This shit is real as fuck. No one chooses to live this way. It’s dangerous and kills more young people than anything else. There is not a person alive that doesn’t know someone who has it. There’s no shame in being sick. Read about it and learn what you can do to help your loved one. It’s not rocket science, it just takes a little bit of desire & knowledge on your part to find out whats going on and what you can do to help. That’s what its all about. If you got this far and know someone who is sick or are sick yourself, try to get some help. Ireland is not great when it comes to services for mental health but there are some good things you can do. Make sure you have a good doctor. When things got bad for me in 2012, my family doctor, who I had been going to since I was born told me I had nothing to be stressed about! There are guys like that out there but doctors are generally going to be clued in. Try CBT and mindfulness meditation for the anxiety. A bit of exercise helps if you can manage it. Doesn’t have to be a 5k run or anything, just something that works for you. You might wonder who am I to be offering advice but I’ve lived with this shit full time and in my face for long enough now to know a few things about it. This is what gives me the hope that I will come out the other side. And finally, If you read this, and you know me, you will know who wrote it. I didn’t use my ex’s name because she is entitled to her privacy so obviously I I’m not going to use my own name. I also signed a non disclosure agreement when I left that company I worked for until 2012 that stops me from speaking about them in any way. I didn’t go into too much detail here but I will at another time if I keep writing. Thanks for reading",2017

How to Fight Anxiety Without Medication,SHARE THIS ARTICLE,2017
On the unbearableness of existence,"The last three months of my life have been pretty awful, I’m not going to lie. I’m prone to depression anyway, but around November/December I found myself falling into a whole new type of brainfuckery — anxiety. I’ve always been a bit of a worrier, but this really knocked me for six. I have reservations about everything but this was totally different. Imagine being mortally terrified for your life, all the time, about everything. Imagine talking to people, smiling but not really concentrating, because you’re completely convinced that in a few minutes you’re going to die. Like, that is all you can think about — “when am I going to die? It feels imminent.” Imagine sitting at work, with trembling and clammy hands, trying to swallow the rising panic in your chest; the sort that leaves you reaching for the cup of water but almost spilling it. Just sitting quietly without screaming is really, really hard. It’s exhausting and fucking horrible and I wouldn’t wish it on anyone. I’m normally a confident, fun and funny person who enjoys life and loves laughing and likes doing cool stuff. Anxiety stripped me of my joy, not in the same way that depression does, but because you’re always watching your back, always on alert, waiting for something to happen. It robbed me of my ability to really enjoy things that I previously enjoyed, because everything was tainted with pure, unreasonable fear. I went from someone who loves travelling and having new experiences to someone who spent an entire holiday in Cuba feeling terrified, exhausted, and wanting to cry a lot, and came back seriously wondering if she would ever go abroad again. I watched Star Wars: Rogue One at the cinema which somehow triggered what I can only describe as an extended panic attack that lasted for the entire film, and I burst into tears when I left the cinema. It’s utterly unbearable to live with. I was fairly determined to not let it control me, and to do everything to try and get rid of it. I took extra vitamins and minerals, went for walks, listened to mindfulness apps, tried to rationalise a lot of my ridiculous and unfounded fears, spoke a lot to my then-boyfriend about why I was scared and what was happening. The thing is, no one really understands. Because it’s so irrational and ridiculous that it’s just bonkers to try and comprehend. It’s like a phobia, but a phobia of literally every single thing in the world. I can’t emphasise enough: Every single thing is scary. And it therefore fosters a self-fulfilling cycle and sense of helplessness and paralysis. Even as I explained to people, as the words tumbled out of my mouth, I found myself thinking “this is so insane. I’ve gone mad”, but the brain is a curious thing. Nothing seemed to fully shift it; I would feel better and have a good handle on things, only to slip back into paranoia and a whole cycle of ‘what ifs’ that could start as innocuously as me leaving the house, and lead to the inevitable, horrific demise of everyone I love, and then my inevitable early and painful death. I resolved to go to the doctor, who concluded that I did indeed have what sounds like “debilitating, severe anxiety”, and he gave me a few tips but most importantly he explained how I could self-refer to IAPT (Improving Access to Psychological Therapies). IAPT is basically a system where individuals can self-refer for mental health issues, and I think they offer a range of services depending on what your exact problem is. I was offered self-guided CBT. To be perfectly honest with you, I find a lot of counselling to be a bit patronising. It’s very ‘back to basics’, but then it kind of has to be — what you’re trying to do is rewire your brain to not freak out all the time, and to understand how anxiety happens so that you can take steps to prevent panic attacks and deal with it better. You have to fill out a survey that takes into account how you felt over the last fortnight. “How often have you felt you don’t enjoy things?”, “How often have you wanted to hurt yourself?”, “How often have you not been able to sleep?” My first meeting had me answering that I felt lots of these things “more than half of the last fortnight”, which meant I was quite seriously not ok. The tactic that we started on was to start classifying my thoughts and worries into “I can do something about this” or “I cannot do anything about this”. Like I say, patronising, but it actually seemed to work, as I’ve been mentally categorising my fears or anxieties into “I can fix this” (so let’s do something) and “I can’t do anything” (let someone else worry about it) ever since. It helps to give me a bit of space between me and my thoughts, space between reality and my own head. I’m happy to say that at my second IAPT appointment today, I did the survey again and was told I am in the recovery zone — I don’t need to see anyone anymore, but I can always go back if I need to. It’s weird how sometimes the smallest thing that someone says can be a real game-changer for you. I am not by any means fixed or totally ok, not by a long shot. But my recovery is beginning and it feels like the clouds have parted somewhat. I feel like I’m making positive steps to get rid of this stupid, crippling anxiety, and that can only be a good thing. If you like my work, why not buy me a coffee?",2017
Overcoming Depression,"Please recognize, you may be reluctant to do this for fear that it will make you even more depressed. Remaining tied to false truths and half-truths may seem more comforting than living life in the glare of intellectual honestly. If you feel that way, aren’t you tired of living your life while feeling like a spectator instead of an active participant with the power to choose your own course? Unless you take action, chances are that circumstances won’t force a change to the positive? It’s time to take control of your life and look at where you stand. It’s time to actively and intentionally participate in the direction of your life, shoring up your intellectual integrity. Understand and accept the truths of who you really are. If you have developed a pattern of tying self-worth to activity, you may find it difficult to let go of some of the things you are doing. If you have developed a pattern of believing in your own incompetence, taking on new activities may frighten you with potential failure. If you have developed a pattern of being afraid of making mistakes, an honest appraisal of why you are engaging in an activity may be uncomfortable. You need to have the confident to press on! Don’t let any initial hesitation stop you from being honest with yourself. Your perspective on life is based on what you “know.” These “truths” are often forged in childhood. If what you “know” is framed in negativity, your perceptions and expectations may also be negative. Another way to think of this “knowledge” is as a filter through which you view your life. In depression, life is viewed through gray-colored glasses. Life appears negative, oppressive, and filled with shadows. If you “know” that life consistently treats you unfairly, then the inevitable ups and downs of life are filtered through that perception. If you “know” that life is always to be smooth sailing, the ups and downs can cause tremendous anxiety. Down times are not put into a proper perspective, because you don’t consider them to be legitimate. Down times are supposed to happen to other people, but not to you. If you’re unprepared to deal with these challenging times, frustration and depression can result. If you “know” that you don’t really deserve to be happy, you will filter the events of your life to make sure you aren’t. Good things will be met with suspicion, and bad things will be accepted as inevitable. If you “know” that the only way for you to be safe is to be in control, you will have a heightened sense of anxiety over life events. This perpetual sense of unease can lead to anxiety and depression. Life does not always flow smoothly. Circumstances can alter the most carefully constructed life. Traumatic events will be part of each of our lives. We cannot change this. What we can change, however, is our response to those traumatic events. If the fundamental foundation for what we know about life is based on negativity, we will have little hope and support when challenging times occur. But, we can use intellectual integrity to identify and replace false and half-truths. When we do this, we have a more complete understanding of ourselves and what the world is truly able to offer. Making changes in your life requires a certain level of optimism. If you find it difficult to replace false truths in your life, consider working with a caring professional. Oftentimes, when evaluating our own life activities is done with the help of others, their vantage point offers unique perspectives.",2017
Everything Wrong With Me Right Now That Probably Isn’t,"Like many people who don’t currently have a job outside of their homes, I am what would be called a homebody. My body rarely leaves my home. This is due to a couple of related factors: I have been unemployed/occasionally freelance for a number of months while trying to make a major career transition. That transition is actually underway since I learned I was going to be offered the job of my dreams, but the hiring process is delayed while the company straightens a few things out. So, while I rest easy knowing that I’m about to embark on an amazing journey/earned victory, I am still, as of this moment, a homebody. Because I can’t do much outside the house that doesn’t involve an exchange of money that I can’t spare, I am basically sitting around the house all day with my dog. It sounds pathetic, but this is not a source of shame for me because what exactly am I supposed to do in the dead of winter? What’s happening to me while I wait for things to work themselves out, however, is starting to bug the hell out of me. I think I’ve turned into a hideous, disgusting monster. Look, I’m not trying to fish for compliments here. I don’t really have to. I’m pretty. There. I said it. But this is not based on what I think about myself; it’s based on feedback from others, feedback that I desperately need right now because all this time on my hands has made me turn inward and nothing looks good here. It doesn’t feel very good either. I have no momentum nor the wherewithal nor physical space to take on some sort of fitness venture, so I haven’t gotten much exercise in the past year. My weight hasn’t suffered, but I’m stiff, sore, and soft. I used to feel like a warrior; I kickboxed, I did yoga, and I was Strong. I felt like I could run through a brick wall and then lug the aftermath up a mountain on my back. Now, I walk my dog. It’s not nothing, but man alive, do I feel like a slug. I know this will change, but it’s not happening now. Working out three or four times a week, sometimes even more, not only improved my physical shape, it improved my mental and emotional shape. The endorphins had me in a near-constant state of confidence and I walked around like Claire Underwood and Angelina Jolie. It made me feel like I could intimidate the hell out of people, and I loved it. Loved. It. I can still walk around like that, but it feels like pretending because I’m so tired and sore and anxious and insecure. Those women I mentioned are beautiful women. I felt beautiful when I was working and working out. Now, I’m doing neither and I feel like I look like the girl from The Ring. Or like a grimy raccoon that’s been living in a dumpster. Or a swamp gremlin that’s mole-white and matted down and dying inside. This is why I take pictures of myself on Instagram so I can present my most recent appearance to a few people and have them tell me that I look like the opposite of those things. I don’t need it for my ego, really. I just need reassurance that I’m not losing all my hair and breaking out in cystic acne because my every pore in my body is filled with rancid bacon fat. That was a really grotesque paragraph, right? And none of it is true. But when you’re already self-conscious about a few things and other things that are bigger than you are beyond your control, you turn inward to the things you think you can control. For me, that’s my appearance. Everyone has “ugly days,” even if you’ve reached that coveted moment of blissful, resigned acceptance of yourself. It goes beyond “Yeah, my skin’s not my favorite” or “My hair is kind of flat” or “I used to have sick, sick abs, but my jeans still look fine.” We will all have a day when there is not a single thing good about how we look. We snap out of it. Life distracts us. My life is on hold. I can’t snap out of it. All I want to do is fix every single part of me, but I’m not even sure I’ll do it right. The Pinterest and Amazon and Google rabbit holes are telling me all different things, and they might all be lies. There are lies sitting in bottles in my shower right now, and my hair and skin still aren’t that much better, even though they probably are and I just can’t see it. Jamie, you went off birth control and it gave you PCOS, and that’s why you needed DHT blockers. Because your testosterone was high and you were growing an old lady beard and balding like an old man. YOU LOOKED LIKE GOLLUM, JAMIE. Jamie, you lost what you thought was the job of a lifetime and the shock caused you stress and made your hair fall out and you looked like the “True Hollywood Story” of Girl, Interrupted, which looks more like a Ryan Murphy production which is gruesome and ugly but also HONEST. Jamie, all of your follicles and pores are clogged. What the fuck have you been doing? Why are you putting sewer leavings and medical waste on your skin? Jamie, you’re in your late 30s now and everything about you is dying, including all the eggs that are evacuating your sad, sad ovaries, like six at a time. Because there are no men left in real life who want to do anything but fuck you and leave you except for guys who do nothing for you and the dream versions of celebrities whom you date in your sad, sad head. #sad Jamie, your scalp is taking over your whole head and if you cut your hair short as a way of “doing something fun to change your appearance/exert control over your body” you’re just going to look like that sick, sad, bigoted, sexist, be-comb-overed asshole who is ruining the country and the world. Yeah. You’re gonna look like Trump if you cut your hair. Bring as many pictures of Michelle Williams to the salon that you want. You’re gonna look like Donald Fucking Trump. No, you’re gonna look like what would happen if Donald Trump impregnated Brundlefly and it somehow survived outside whatever cursed, god-forsaken womb-sac it grew inside then died seconds after realizing that it looked like YOU. So, yeah. This is where my head has been. None of this is true. But it’s a little hard to snap myself out of it. Drinking myself out of it works sometimes, but I’m aware enough to know that’s probably counterproductive to a body I already think is not functioning optimally. So I’m trying to stop. And weed is not an option for me. But yeah, I have no clue what I look like anymore. I have no idea. I’m genuinely not depressed about the state of my life; between this amazing job, I’m also moving to an apartment in a great area and I have family and friends whom I love and love me back. My life is on a clear upswing, I’m just waiting for a couple of things to straighten out. When they do, I will go to work, I will work out again, I will spend much less time thinking about my appearance, and I can let life just happen to me. Like it’s supposed to. For now, though, I am a disgusting monster that is freaking out. At least I feel like one. So yes, I will take pictures of myself and await the delicious, delicious compliments.",2017
How to Stop Yourself From Jumping Straight to the Worst-Case Scenario,"I’d have to use up my remaining sick days, and I wouldn’t be able to train for my half marathon. All of my projects would come to a halt and pile up, anxiously awaiting my return. I even drafted an email (in my head) to my editor about writing this very article. Dear Jenni, Unfortunately, my appendix has decided to break up with me. I’m currently in the hospital and don’t think I’ll meet my deadline. Can we push it back? Let me know! Sincerely, Appendix-Free Abby. A few hours later the pain ceased and I returned to my pre-panicked life. My tendency to prep for the worst-case scenario is not limited to the occasional stomachache. It bleeds over into most parts of my life and often shows up at work. This is called catastrophizing, or, in plainer words, it’s exactly what my mother meant when she told me I make mountains out of molehills. And this is not exactly a trait that makes the list of desired skills and qualifications. Yes, it’s good to be a prepared employee. But there’s a very big difference between reviewing your PowerPoint before you present to a client and creating three entirely different options just in case your boss hates the first one. Over-preparing, as any over-preparer knows, can serve as a major distraction and time suck. You spend so much time getting ready for the world to end that you can’t focus on the tasks that are actually on your to-do list. Not to mention, it’s also an added stressor. You’ve convinced yourself that the worst possible thing that could happen will definitely happen. And now your mind (and body) is reacting to that false assumption. And as we all know, too much stress isn’t good for your health or productivity. But yes, there will be some situations that’ll require you to do more planning than usual, and some that’ll cause you to (rightfully) push aside what you’re currently doing. But not every issue falls into these two categories, and it’s important to be able to identify which ones do and which ones don’t. These two questions can help you do that. Don’t worry — you don’t need to pull out your high school stats book and review the principles of probability. But you do need to ask yourself this question. Because if the possibility is low, then it’s probably not something you need to dedicate any (or much) of your time and attention to. For instance, if I’m bringing a speaker to campus, and we’ve already paid, signed contracts, and booked her transportation and hotel rooms, the chance that she’ll back out last minute and not show up is not very high. I don’t need to take up valuable brain space worrying about that. On the other hand, if an event like commencement is planned outside on the quad, and 2,500 seniors will be matriculating with their loved ones in attendance, I should probably have an alternate rain location ready-to-go. Let’s say the risk is high. The next question you need to ask yourself is what the outcomes could be if it does occur. In the case of the graduation, I can’t just say, “Oopsie! Lightening just struck the podium. Please go home and we’ll send your diplomas in the mail.” But, let’s say it’s not a momentous life event. Instead, it’s a leisurely de-stress fest you’ve planned for students during finals week that involves coloring and corn hole. (Can you tell I’m speaking from experience here?) If the forecast calls for pouring rain, you may have to end up canceling. And that’s OK. Sure, it’s a bummer, but that’s just the way the cookie crumbles sometimes. You didn’t put a ton of money into it, and you can schedule the event on another day or simply provide the students with other ways to manage stress and take a break from studying. If the likelihood of the worst-case scenario becoming reality is high and you’ve determined that the potential outcomes could be disastrous, then you should table the rest of your to-do list for now and determine an action plan. And, in most cases, you won’t need to do this alone. Don’t be afraid to reach out to your supervisor and other colleagues. If the issue is something that could be detrimental to your team, then it’s possibly damaging to the company as a whole, and others should be willing to lend you a hand. At the end of the day, the point is that not every single potential problem needs to be made into a big deal. Save yourself time, energy, and inefficiency by stepping back to evaluating the situation before you move forward full speed ahead. Originally published at www.themuse.com on February 16, 2017.",2017
The Importance Of Music To My Mental Health,"When Chance said “Music is all we got” he was right. For a lot of us music is listened to for more than just our enjoyment. Your favorite song can make you feel better on your worst days or amazing on your best. However, sometimes certain albums and songs become more than that. Sometimes that album or song can be the only thing that keeps you from exploding or it makes it okay when you do. Personally I have albums and songs that do that for me. The music of people like Childish Gambino, Kanye West, Frank Ocean, and James Blake has kept me going at times when I didn’t always see a reason to. These artists have made music that provides a safety net for my mind and my emotions that I have personally never been able to give myself and I can say that this music has saved my life. Anyone who knows me knows that I am not the most perfect person. I cry a lot, I’m dramatic as hell, and I am terrible in social situations. 9/10 if there are more than 3 people in any given place you will see me with my headphones in listening to music. Is it because I’m trying to be an asshole or I’m disinterested? No, it’s just what I need to be comfortable in that moment. You’ll rarely see me anywhere without my headphones because nothing is more soothing or calming for me than music and for a person who could have a panic or anxiety attack at any time my headphones and my phone are the best things I could have. Music provides a sense of comfortability in places where I feel least comfortable and for that I will be forever grateful to the artists that make it.",2017

Why virtual reality can help you overcome your fear of flying.,"I’ve always suffered with a fear of flying.   It all began when my first ever international flight hit intense turbulence, described by a veteran air hostess as “The worst turbulence I’ve ever experienced” —Jetstar hostess, flushed with embarrassment after screaming. Circa 2011 Syd-DPS (Bali)  My intense excitement for travelling and flying was marred by a uneasiness every time I entered an aircraft. (And a vivid memory of the sheer panic in our hostesses scream) Apparently I’m not alone with flight anxiety. Nearly 1 in 3 adult Americans are identity as anxious about flying or afraid to fly. (Source: “Fear of Flying: Impact on the U.S. Air Travel Industry.”) So how did I overcome this?  I started flying with my Virtual Reality headset.  I recently began using my VR headset during the flight, and what an amazing experience this is. I firstly started using my own app, adeptly named Relax VR to see if was effective. I can report that transporting yourself to a tropical beach instead of a cattle class nightmare is actually very effective.   But.  I started to realise that a lot of VR experiences are suited to VRlying or VR Flying as I’ve started to call it;). VR Travel apps (Ascape) as well as news (NYT and WSJ) are all amazing for escaping outside of the walls of the plane. Hell, VR travel experiences get you even more excited to visit the destination you’re heading too!   So. Before taking that valium or having that fourth glass of wine , try a VR headset loaded with some cool VR apps on your next flight.  Let me know how you go :)  Happy flying.  Eddie",2017
Trial and Error: 6 things that have helped our ASD daughter,"When Mika was first diagnosed, I threw myself, heart and soul, into researching ways to help her. The poor kid became a veritable guinea pig for just about anything I came across that sounded remotely feasible: dietary changes, supplements, homeopathy, naturopathy…you name it, we tried it. Many seemed to have at least some benefit, but not all were worth pursuing. Mika has an abhorrence of swallowing any kind of pill/capsule, so supplements have pretty much fallen by the wayside. Dietary changes were a nightmare for someone who dislikes so many tastes and textures (and is vegetarian to boot), and I had to let things slide on that front as well, just for the sake of my sanity. (She has since become gluten-free on her own, and yes, I’ve seen improvement in brain function…but I try not to tell her, “I told you so!”) Through a long (oh, so long!) process of trial and error, however, we’ve added some things to our toolbox that have helped her tremendously (and consequently us, too). Here’s a list of the top ones: And there you have it. Six things that have worked for us that you might want to consider for your own child (or yourself) if you haven’t already. But please remember that not all things will suit all people, so your results may vary from ours. Oh, and may I respectfully suggest you don’t try all of them at once? Apparently being bombarded with ideas (no matter how well meaning) from parents (no matter how loving) can be a little overwhelming for someone with ASD… Oops. :P Originally published on February 16, 2017 at https://www.dancingwithmydaughter.com/single-post/2017/02/17/Trial-and-Error-6-things-that-have-worked-for-our-ASD-daughter **Defense mode is a term used by Asperger Experts.

Category errors,"February 16, 2017 February 16, 2017/ Aidan Morgan Yesterday my boss walked into the lunch room as I was looking at a container of cookies and asked me how I was doing. I said, “Choosing a cookie,” which I now realize was a description of what I was doing, not how. Still, I don’t feel that I answered incorrectly. If you’re in a state of mind in which choosing a cookie is your main concern, you’re doing pretty well. Here’s the truth, though: I wasn’t choosing a cookie. I was staring at a jumbled pile of identical heart-shaped shortbread cookies, wondering what possible impact my choice could have on my life. With at least two dozen identical possibilities, the very notion of choice evaporates. In that situation, the only available choice is whether or not to select a cookie. Which I had already done. So I had been caught in a post-choice moment, what the academics like to call a liminal space. What I should have said is, “Having chosen to eat a cookie but not yet taken one, I’m delaying the moment of action by pretending to have a further choice of which cookie to eat, when it’s obvious that my final pick doesn’t matter. I can only conclude that I’m looking at these cookies to develop a narrative about my life in which cookie selection becomes an existentially meaningful act. Within that narrative I’m rolling in novelistic detail, endlessly confirming my existence on the plain of the quasi-real, arguably the only place where humans truly exist. We rise, we revise, and fall back once more, but we fall into a richer and stranger world. So yeah, I’m doing great. Would you like a cookie?” In the end I picked a cookie with white sugar sprinkles instead of pink, because that seemed a little more authentic.

I am sorry.,"Tell your story. What’s on your mind? After I come back to the room, dragging a tired body up the stairs, I open the laptop and hit all the social networking sites open. Scrolling up. Down. Refresh. I shut it down. Take off my spectacles and gulp down water. I change into nightclothes and prepare to sleep. This is when it starts hurting. The sleep which had been killing me all day, suddenly travels downwards. It creeps down my throat, becoming stickier by the moment, till it reaches my stomach. By this time, it has transformed into that scary witch again: anxiety. I lay awake for hours, bouts of panic attacks stiffening my body, bending my feet into cramps. I want to shout but I muffle my voice in the pillow because I am tired of telling people. I don’t want any pity in that moment. What I want is a tight slap across my face and being forced to breathe. Trust me, I can literally feel the last vestige of the oxygen leave my body and it is a good two or three seconds before I can force myself to breathe again. Tears roll down my cheeks as I lay spent, looking into the dark as my roommate’s soft, heavy breathing brings me back slowly. I am sorry. I am sorry for being like this. This is an apology I owe my body, which has no clue why I stand with the toothbrush in my hand for five minutes, looking at the mirror. It is just my brain telling my hand that I have to start brushing. This is an apology I owe my entire existence, for making it so hard. For making it think that it is not enough. Always trying too hard, to compensate for what my brain is continuously telling me I lack. Laughing too hard. Talking too loud. But always feeling small. But, this is also an apology that I owe you. I know I am not what they’d call the perfect person. I never was and I never can be. Behind the closed doors, you have seen what my disease does to me. I have slowly come to terms with that. And trust me, I try. I try to behave just as normally as others. It’s not my fault that I need you more than other people in other kinds of relationships. Remember, when one text reaches you, it is because I have pushed myself to the last limit of not needing you, before I pick up that phone. If that is called being needy, then so be it. I do not get what is wrong with needing a person in whose presence I do not have to go through excruciating pain. Nobody says a person is being needy when they ask for an inhaler, do they? Social tags is not what bothers me. What does bother me is that I sense a little impatience in you. A change in routine. A motivation to do something new. I don’t blame you, if I were in your place, I would be scared too. I would be scared and bored. Who wants this kind of responsibility? I understand. But I also want you to know that I am trying very hard. To give you your own time and not needing you at all, takes enormous amount of efforts from someone who is tired of brushing everyday. After everything said and done, I have a little damaged brain, but my heart is where it should be. I know you need your own time, because I need mine. I know that I need you more than you need me. And I’d be the last one to want to scare you off and I feel like I am doing it. This is phase. Just a tough phase. I promise I will get over it. I am not lying when I say that I am trying, I just do not think that I can play for your attention. I am a little different, but I can move mountains if I want. Yours Unexpectedly.",2017
A linear story about non-linear illnesses,"“My stomach hurts,” I complained to my then-boyfriend back in 2010. “Do you realize that you’ve never gone a day that we’ve dated without having a stomachache?” he asked, a little incredulous. Up until that point, I actually hadn’t noticed — in fact, pain had become such a consistent part of my day-to-day existence that I didn’t keep track of it. My arms, feet, lower back, and chest all regularly felt deep throbbing, squeezing, or shooting pains. My hips often felt like they were moving backwards as the rest of my body moved forward, and I frequently lost my balance thanks to dizziness and muscle pain. Soon after he pointed this out, I spent an afternoon tracking all of my pain in a Word doc. When I started paying attention, I realized just how constant it was. Prior to that day, I was aware that I was often ill, sore, or exhausted, but I’d always blamed it on not sleeping or exercising enough, therefore consistently talking myself out of actually seeking help as an adult. This, compounded with my negative experiences with doctors during my teen years, resulted in totally ignoring symptoms that others might have seen as giant red flags. Allow me to back up for a moment: I hate going to the doctor so much that I will do just about anything in my power to avoid going, unless it’s an emergency or I need new contact lenses. I attribute this intense aversion to two things: being misdiagnosed with bipolar disorder and over-medicated at 12-years-old (a story for another day); but even moreso, I credit it to seeing nearly a dozen doctors as my parents and I attempted to figure out the cause of a frequent chest pain I experienced throughout high school. Even though I was waking up every few days feeling like someone was simultaneously twisting my diaphragm and sitting on my chest, no one could deliver an answer. Specialist after specialist looked at me and couldn’t discern anything concretely wrong with my body, so they often operated under the assumption that I was either making it up or imagining it. This not only makes people with chronic debilitating pain feel frustrated, anxious, and unheard; it also makes us scared to seek treatment. It’s like calling 911 because your kitchen is on fire, but then the firefighters tell you there’s nothing wrong because they can’t see flames from outside the house. I eventually gave up trying to find an answer and just resigned myself to not knowing. This isn’t an uncommon experience among people who have been repeatedly deterred by unconvinced doctors. Flash forward to my college years when I finally decided to track all my pain that afternoon. While I still felt averse to doctors, I was significantly more determined to both find an answer and to advocate for myself. I saw a rheumatologist who tested me for Lyme disease, rheumatoid arthritis, lupus, and several other illnesses, all of which came back negative. But rather than dismiss my pain as feigned or imagined, this doctor believed me when I insisted on how I was feeling. She analyzed my symptoms and, having eliminated the aforementioned possibilities, drew a conclusion. Finally, after years of searching in vain for an answer, my doctor diagnosed me with fibromyalgia, a “chronic disorder characterized by widespread pain, diffuse tenderness, and a number of other symptoms,” according to the National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases. Its causes aren’t clear, though it’s worth noting some doctors associate it with traumatic events as well as a person’s genetics. But at least I finally had a name for it — and that meant I could look for potential treatments. Still, while I have a diagnosis and certain measures I take that help with my fibro, it doesn’t change how debilitating it can sometimes still be. This compounded with my clinical depression, lifelong obsessive-compulsive disorder, and bulimia makes for a whole lot of cancelled plans and missed work. There are still days where my chest feels like it’s being stepped on, where my entire body feels like it’s covered in ice water. For at least three weeks in 2016, I felt like my arms were on pins and needles the way your limbs get if they lose circulation. I get sick if there’s too much pressure on my midsection, I throw up after sex once in awhile, and I have heightened temperature sensitivity so I shake or sweat a lot. (I know, I know — I’m really selling myself as boatloads of fun here!) And because I still look as able-bodied and average-sized as I did when all the doctors in high school dismissed my ailments, many people make inferences about my motivations and competence. When you don’t seem sick in the conventional ways people associate with injury or illness — crutches, a sling, a stuffy nose — it can be very difficult to have your limitations respected and your pain acknowledged. This is one of the main reasons mental illness is so easy to dismiss: it’s essentially invisible (though anyone with depression who literally cannot get out of bed some days knows that appearances mean nothing). For those with fibromyalgia or any other illness that people can’t immediately see just by looking at you, being unable to complete certain tasks or maintain a “healthy” lifestyle is often met with skepticism and scrutiny. People often assume you’re just lazy or irresponsible, even if it takes you the same amount of physical and emotional energy to leave the house as it takes other folks to run a mile. Of course, we are all guilty of making inaccurate judgments towards others based on appearances. But for doctors, employers, and loved ones to do this to a person who’s suffering from a serious chronic medical condition, it can be hurtful and even unsafe. If a person feels like their experiences are disregarded by those around them, they may be less likely to take steps to getting better. If one of your loved ones (or even just a coworker or acquaintance) says they’re hurting, whether it’s mental or physical, believe them — it not only can help validate their experiences and suffering, it can also compel them to seek necessary treatments, should they have been reluctant up until that point. And if it’s you who’s in pain, please know this: you deserve to be believed and acknowledged. You are entitled to compassion and understanding from those around you. Whenever possible, advocate for yourself and trust your instincts if you think something is wrong. It’s not all in your head.",2017
Please Take Time For Self-Care,"Folks, I don’t want to harp on this too much, but please: have fun. It’s a word people don’t want to hear at times like this. It feels like a betrayal to feel good even for a second when terrible things are going on. But I need you. We need you. And humans just aren’t made to hold up under constant anxiety and fear. Seriously, it’s why we’re designed this way; it’s why we have panic reactions, fight-or-flight instincts, adrenaline surges, the whole lot of it. There are some creatures out there which constantly live on the edge, but humans evolved with a huge set of physical and emotional triggers to prevent that — mostly because it allows our bodies to give us a lot more when we need it. To take a diversion and explain that, every human is something like ten times stronger than we think that we are. We’re all capable of lifting a bus, under the right conditions. But that kind of raw power comes with a HUGE price, and so we’re also designed to only ever use it in times of utter necessity — and that’s where all of those other triggers come in. We have a complex systems of checks and balances which ensure that we never get any more power and speed and focus, etc, than we need at any given moment, and the rest of the time, we run on standby, and that’s why we live as long as we do. Those “superhuman” feats aren’t just physical. And you’re performing them on a regular basis even if you’re completely happy and neurotypical. Think of sports. An average person can spot a ball flying through the air, make a pretty good calculation of where it’s going to come down, and work out exactly how to throw it to more or less put it where they want it to go. And you’re already beyond what some of our best computers are capable of in terms of rapid calculation; the amount of math that goes into that is unreal. Now consider Serena Williams. Her tennis abilities owe plenty to her physical ability, no doubt. But they owe a lot more to her ability to tap into that “superhuman” level of focus; to, in a split second, determine precisely where a ball will end up and precisely how to strike it to put it exactly where she wants it to go. That pretty much is beyond any technology we’ve invented, and it’s every bit as energy-intensive. If you’ve ever found yourself completely “in the zone” while playing a game, or been in a situation where time seemed to slow down, you’ve experienced Tthat; your brain responding to stimulus by ramping up its processing power temporarily. People who suffer from mental health issues like anxiety and depression are constantly going through a low-level version of this; there’s a reason that mental health is synonymous with creativity, and there’s also a reason they tell you that they feel tired all the time — it’s because they are! Constantly following this horror show without also taking the time to take care of your mental health unbalances all of that. It causes us to constantly run at high power and turns on all of those systems that are extremely stressful to us long-term, and it can and will take you out of the game. Humans were never intended for that. Anxiety was supposed to be a feeling reserved for seeing a hunting lion nearby, not an everyday thing. Panic was for when the lion saw YOU. We’re not supposed to be feeling it on a constant basis, and just like an overclocked chip, an overclocked brain will eventually burn you out. So even if you’re just sitting on your buns all day, if you’re regularly experiencing anxiety, fear, depression, panic — and if you’re amping that up by constantly reading the news and not taking time to care for yourself — you’re ultimately taking damage. And even superheroes need downtime. Superman himself had a Fortress of Solitude for when he got sick of the world’s shit. He kept a diary and a trophy case and worked on various projects. There is no shame in turning off and tuning out regularly to keep yourself running; we’re made for it. And even Men Of Steel from the Planet Krypton acknowledge it. So take time, every day, every time you feel overwhelmed, to sit back and relax and let some of it go. Because I want every last one of you to be with us for a long time to come.",2017
When Anxiety Attacks,"With anxiety, the smallest problems can grow into insurmountable obstacles. A wave of overwhelming panic builds and overtakes its victim. To create Float, my upcoming graphic memoir, I must confront my anxiety head on. I’ll be sharing helpful tips that I’ve learned to fight back, but in this passage I wanted to tell you a bit about my anxiety attacks. Some attacks I suffer are silent. You wouldn’t know I was having one. I’m quiet and still but inside my mind is a 12 round fight. Recently, I have acquired a new coping skill where I clench my hand over my mouth during the anxiety attack. This attack has been happening to me on airplanes, movie theaters and concerts. It’s making fun nights out on the town few and far between. Another form of attack I experience is a monster. It’s like an angry summer storm that gains power and anger as it continues. Then it peters out and I’m left among the damage. I’ll pace and talk to myself and rant. I’ll focus my anger on others and then on myself. I’ll then collapse with regret and embarrassment. Embarrassment is one of my stronger skills. I’ve been honing it since I was a child and I’m quite good at it. A third common type of attack for me is what I refer to as a complete shutdown. I collapse and curl into a ball. I can’t move from the floor. I first experienced this after college following an argument with a roommate. As with all of the attacks, I’m left drained and weak. I have been able to stop myself during attacks. Not as often as I’d like, but I’m doing better. What great story doesn’t star a hero who struggles and faces challenges? You’re all the heroes of your stories. We’re not perfect creatures. And the idea of perfection is another Glass Ceiling hovering above us. Breathing exercises, meditation, yoga and self-hypnosis are all wonderful weapons and tools I use in my ongoing fight against anxiety. And I’ve been finding great comfort in reading your Breakthrough Moments. To see such heart and honesty in the submissions is inspiring. Thank you for joining me in this fight. Together, we will Float.",2017
The mental collapse in the digital paradigm,"Mattias Östmar wrote a great article in the beginning of last year — he writes great articles all the time — which makes your mind explode. On surface level it’s about the stresses of the digital paradigm we’re in, but he explores so many tangents that it’s at times hard to keep up. It’s urging us to start thinking about new categories that takes life into account. Such a shame it’s not in English! Maybe Google Translate can help anyone interested in reading the full article, otherwise I’ve had a go at translating my favourite parts. For many years I’ve been nurtured by the belief that we need new categories. I’ve even tried to incorporate a few in media analyses. Often I’ve believed that I’m in a hurry to get them in there, but I don’t think like that anymore. Our society is still fully dominated by the old categories. Right–left. Big bubble–small bubble. That’s about it. Green bubble is yet too hard to think about… …The fundamental source of anxiety in the digital paradigm is a feeling of mental collapse caused by several simaltanous possibilities. The only cure is to log out. Turn inwards and go out in nature. Get rid of the existensial exhaustion with rest, fresh air and outdoor activities. Train yourself in not giving a fuck about anything. Trust that the wave will rise by itself in billions of intricate ways even when you have logged off from the network for a while. That’s how I see the new categories. I’m deeply convinced that we need to put human categories first. Categories that has something to do with life. Prosperous – Paralysed. Tense–Relaxed. Energetic–Catatonic. It doesn’t matter whether an ocean is big if it’s dead. Whether there’s a dialouge is less important than whether it’s moving or still. Seen from this perspective it is apparent that the current phase of digitalisation only strengthens the old categories. The quantification of society gushes — drowns — our way of thinking and therefore what we do and how we act. Activity trackers. Quantitative surveys of the supposedly social behaviour online. Big Data. Small Mind… …A computer never hesitates. That’s its biggest fault. A human that never hesitates suffer from the same problem. Or rather, the surroundings will soon suffer of such inhumane approach to existence’s endless complexity. An approach that is binary in the same way as the customer satisfaction in-store trackers. Are you happy or sad? Are you with us or against us? On which side of the wall do you stand? This is unfortunately where the collective mind is heading rapidly, most likely even faster with the help of the technologically driven quantification of society and the each individual’s life. Naturally, it is not sustainable.",2017
Miedo,"Todo el miedo que llevo dentro vive feliz dentro de mi. Por más que intento sacudírmelo él se me agarra con fuerza. Mi garrapata existencial me acompaña a todas partes. Se hace fuerte los días tristes. Toma posesión de mi. Campa a sus anchas. Me llena la cabeza de pensamientos obsesivos y apenas me deja respirar. No hay escapatoria. Me conoce demasiado bien. Me maneja y me controla. Días, semanas, meses enteros. A veces son solo horas o minutos. Para recordarme quien manda. Para que no olvide que le pertenezco.",2017

The Prevalence of Anxiety in Today’s Society,"You’re running late. You’ve got a presentation at work that has been looming for weeks and your car won’t start. Your in-laws are in town, your son just got suspended in school and your daughter is dating a boy you don’t like. You’re stressed, and understandably so. Sometimes the pressures in our life add up, and it can be a lot to handle. Don’t worry, you’re not going crazy; everyone has moments when they feel overwhelmed. But what happens when our stress and anxiety levels rise above the norm? More confusing, what does it mean when we’re anxious without any of the above stressors being present? Anxiety disorders are the most commonly diagnosed mental illness in the United States, affecting 18% of the population. It’s an illness that costs the country $42 billion a year and only one third of those who need help actually receive treatment. Some have even gone so far to declare anxiety disorders the “Disease of the 21st Century.” Understanding Anxiety Disorders An anxiety disorder is a diagnosable, treatable mental illness. Those suffering from it can experience crippling worry and fear, and there are several varieties of the illness with different symptoms. Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD) affects approximately 3.1% of the American population. Women are more likely to be affected by it than men and it’s characterized by overarching and excessive worry, concern and tension even if there is nothing specific that triggers these feelings. Panic disorder is diagnosed in approximately 2.7% of the country’s population and is twice as common in women than in men. Panic disorders are characterized by severe “attacks” of symptoms known as anxiety attacks or panic attacks. These feelings often strike without warning and might make the individual feel like they’re having a heart attack or “going crazy.” Another type of anxiety disorder is social anxiety or social phobia, which is diagnosed in approximately 6.8% of Americans. Individuals with this diagnosis feel overwhelmed by social situations and live with a fear of being judged by others and feeling embarrassed. Specific phobias occur when you have a significant, irrational fear attached to a specific object or situation. Approximately 8.7% of Americans experience this type of anxiety. Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (OCD) and Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) are also closely linked with anxiety disorders and are sometimes characterized as them. Individuals with OCD feel compelled to complete a certain behavior to counteract a fear or obsession. PTSD describes the severe stress and anxiety felt after living through a traumatic incident. The varying types of anxiety disorder demonstrate the complexity of this condition, making each person’s encounter with it very unique. Adolescent Anxiety Anxiety is the most prevalent mental illness in the United States, but it’s also the condition most commonly diagnosed in adolescents. Typically, adolescents living with anxiety developed poor coping mechanisms as a child and therefore tend to avoid issues happening in the world around them. If this avoidance isn’t addressed, they struggle to cope with overwhelming and stressful situations as they grow older, causing their anxiety to grow. One study, published in the Australian and New Zealand Journal of Psychiatry, examined anxiety across 12 countries. It showed that, while America’s statistics were relatively steady in comparison to other regions, anxiety is rising amongst youth around the world. Even Britain’s top universities have had a dramatic increase in students seeking help for anxiety over the past decade. So how do we begin to address these statistics? How do we help our children develop positive coping skills at a young age? Addressing Anxiety The causes of anxiety are complex and occur as a result of both mental and environmental stresses. There’s no sure way to predict whether or not someone will develop an anxiety disorder. Instead, it’s important to help your children develop coping mechanisms at a young age and to ensure they get the professional support they need if they do in fact struggle with anxiety. Establishing routines and encouraging low-sugar, high-nutrient diets help both you and your children to feel less stressed. Getting plenty of sleep and exercise also helps the body to feel energized and refreshed. Teach your children to express their concerns in a constructive way and teach them how to manage their time and set goals towards facing any difficulties. That being said, if stress and worry appears to be insurmountable for you or child, be sure to seek the help of a mental health professional as they can show you how to manage your anxiety in a healthy way.

Feeling Anxy (and how to fix it),"If you have anxiety, life can be struggle at the best of times. If you have anxiety in the fiery hell-scape that is the news climate we now live in, the number of weeks where daily life feels unmanageable has been on the rise. It certainly has for me. Sometime last year, I realised that awareness of my anxiety was not something I could have on the back burner; I needed to place it front and centre so that I’m forced to check in and manage it every day. I have learned the hard way that the alternative to this daily management is a pattern of suppression that bumbles along until it manifests in ways that really affect my life and ability to work. For me, that usually comes in the form of random, OCD-level fixations on micro-catastrophes that never actually happen but totally subsume my headspace. Turns out, over time, this can make you quite ill. We all know the common tips for anxiety — exercise, sleep, eat well, therapy — are all good and advisable. But frankly, they’re not always available or realistic. In the past year, coinciding with this increased focus on managing my anxiety, I was unable to run as much as I’d like, which forced me to explore some alternative management techniques. A funny thing happened: I learned that sometimes the feeling that we “must” exercise causes more stress, anxiety, and guilt than it alleviates. This is amplified by the fact that we live in a wellness and achievement-obsessed culture, where the intensity of our exercise regime has somehow been linked to our efficacy as a human. I’m certainly happy that I can run again, but I feel less of a need to be intense about it and I can easily skip a week without feeling like a worthless slug. I couldn’t do that two years ago. So, remember that while getting up at 6:30 am to go to the gym every single day is rewarded in our culture, it’s not always what your body needs. Sometimes you just need to sleep. Everyone is different, but these are some small habits that, done consistently and in aggregate, help me inch back to equilibrium. They are all free and inherently easy. Thanks to all the yoga instructors, therapists, YouTubers, and friends who helped me figure these out. (NB: I’m largely writing this list down for myself for the next time I’m feeling off kilter, which could frankly be tomorrow.) Find a few recordings you really like and stick to them: There are a zillion guided mediations you can find online, on YouTube, on apps, but I find doing a different one every time isn’t as helpful. My therapist gave me a three minute breathing exercise that I keep on my phone that is so short and easy there is virtually no excuse not to do it. Doing it regularly is key for me, because establishing the habit when I’m feeling okay makes it comforting to come back to when I’m feeling like an anxious mess (Just sayin’: it’s also possible to do this in a bathroom stall, which is sometimes necessary). Sometimes getting to a yoga class on time in a busy day can be more stressful than it’s worth. It’s also not enough for me to just do a single 60 or 90 minute class per week, but I can’t afford much more than that. Far more effective is doing five to fifteen minutes a day. Think less about headstands and arm-toning chaturangas and more about nervous system-calming poses that are extremely easy. If you don’t know those, there are millions of YouTube channels to get you started (I like this one and this one). If you invest in a yoga bolster for poses like supported child’s pose and legs-up-against-the-wall, I promise you your life will change (I love this Shanti Sundays one). I also like using the app Insight Timer to time myself in five minute increments. The key is to take the idea that this should be “exercise” out of your mind completely. As my favourite yoga teacher says: lying on your mat for five minutes and focusing on your breathing counts as yoga. Without question, this 15-minutes most days habit is the one that’s had the most significant impact on reducing my anxiety. Having a few routines in your week that you stick to: Volunteering, browsing a bookstore every Wednesday after work, or even having a particular treat every Friday when you finish work can be really grounding. It’s especially nice if one of those routines serves others and gets you out of your own damn mind. I find that perspective is my anxiety’s biggest foe. Do less. When I’m going through a really anxious period, I make a conscious effort to make less social plans. I find spending one weekend night per week reading, watchings good (or bad) Netflix series, eating delicious snacks, and not drinking heavily really helps me re-set and not feel harried all week. Sunday night counts, of course, but I think the effects are amplified if you skip Friday or Saturday social plans. I have to remind myself that it’s okay to be flaky occasionally if I’m having a bad week. If you need to cancel plans, your friends will probably understand, especially if you’re honest about why. Choosing an end of the day to not check email. Because I work across three time zones (London, NYC, LA), it’s not realistic for me to only check emails 9 to 5. But checking emails from 7 am to 11:30 pm makes me miserable. So, most days, I choose one end of the day to be on the clock. Usually evenings are that end because it allows me to correspond with LA. That often means I don’t actually open my email until 10:30 am London time. This isn’t always possible if I’m on a deadline or have a busy day, but I find if I can spend the hours of 7 am to 10 am in my own head rather than in my inbox, it helps me work better and enjoy the nice parts of my morning. Also quitting your email from Friday night and leaving it off all day Saturday will do wonders the rest of your week. Turn off push notifications. If you have push on for your social apps or email, you are a low-key masochist as far as I’m concerned. Turn them off. If you can delete Facebook and FB Messenger from your phone altogether, I highly suggest it. Use Airplane mode at night. Seeing notifications in the first moments of consciousness literally takes your nervous system from 0 to 100, real quick. I noticed that this was really affecting my mood, especially when the first thing I see is the latest fresh hell from NPR or the Guardian. So most nights, I turn my phone on Airplane mode so I get zero notifications while I’m asleep (your alarm clock will still work). Then, when I’m up and have made my coffee, I turn them back on. I can’t tell you how effective this is. It also is a great way to get out of the 45-minutes-looking-at-Instagram-before-getting-up habit (though I still fall victim to that, sometimes). I realise some people can’t do this because they have, like, dependents who might want to call them. If this is you, you can also alter your Do Not Disturb settings on iPhone to allow only certain contacts to reach you. Sit with the feeling and don’t judge yourself. Late last year I was struggling with anxiety every day. I was working in Paris and living a life that, by Instagram standards, was idyllic. But I was struggling to enjoy it because every day I felt like something was mortally wrong with me. I was getting so frustrated with myself for being anxious despite everything being ostensibly okay—even enviable. Because I was spending more time than usual alone, I didn’t have a lot of distractions, so I was forced to sit with the feeling. It sucked. But it helped me realise what I needed to change in my life to fix it. Had I suppressed it with social plans, work, and the like I don’t know if that would’ve been possible. The fact is that most people have some measure of anxiety. Thinking of it as a habit—rather than an integral part of who you are—is helpful. It’s hard to change you are, but it’s possible to change a habit. And some days it works to simply focus on nudging the habit as gently as you can.",2017
Five Things I’ve Learned From Living With Anxiety,"Over the past eight years, I’ve talked to specialists, sat in group therapy and read lots of self-help books and articles.

Watch Out! Your Brain is Listening.,"When you say things like: Your brain is taking notes. That’s why it’s important to keep an ear on how you talk to yourself. It’s pretty simple, really: Keep the cortisol out of your system. Reform positive neural pathways. Watch your words. We’re only just beginning to understand the impact of language in forming cognition (and emotion). As Professor George Lakoff said, “Words matter. 98% of our thoughts are unconscious.” Here’s a line from an insightful piece from The Conversation on combatting stereotypes: “It is the form of the sentence, not exactly what it says, that matters to young children.” When my daughter says, “I don’t want to go to school today. I don’t like school.” or “I can’t read this book,” My response is, “Watch out! Your brain is listening!” “I can.” Originally published at bevoya.com on Feb 17, 2017.

Seven deadly sins of the Anxiety + one at the top of the Tower of Babel,"Anxiety comes in many shapes and colours, but I prefer seeing it as a Tower of Babel, each floor accommodating a deadly sin that anxiety attracts. There is the Lust: a desire in general. Lust for power, and other things... You stop controlling yourself and spend a weekend on amazon Prime to waste money on things you want but you will never use (but hey, you really wanted that one bag when you saw it, who cares that it doesn’t match any other things in your wardrobe), because you know, someone said that shopping is also stress relief. You lust for people’s attention and throw tantrums because there is never enough of it. The Gluttony, an overconsumption to the point of waste, is a thing any of us encountered at least once in life: who hasn’t had a heartbroken weekend with a bucket of ice cream? Or, you know, voring onto a king size portion of fries after an exhausting night out when you also poured gallons of drinks into yourself simply because you felt sad and wanted to relieve the pain of it by going drunks hell? Best thing is, you don’t even have to think much — just order a pizza, there you go. The Greed just loves its brother and sister, Gluttony and Lust, but it’s a love-hate relationship: it is more about hoarding things, especially money. Ready to stress over every penny you spend on the shite you bought at the sale? Welcome to the Greed’s domain! Not ready to throw away that pair of old, ripped jeans, and a dozen more like that? Greed approves! The Sloth is, perhaps, the one we like the most — just bury yourself in pillows. Nothing is getting done because you don’t even want anything to be done. What’s the point when anxiety is telling you that nothing will be done perfectly, the way you want it to? Better not do anything at all and scroll your Tumblr feed whole day and night — it won’t disappoint you as much as your own shit results. The Wrath comes unexpected and trashes everything on its way: you hate yourself for not being good enough, others — for pointing it out or not comforting you. You flip tables and push people away, you hurt yourself and leave scars everywhere because that is what wrath is. It damages both bodies and minds, howling in pain and despair. The Envy is the sneaky one; it whispers over your ear days and night, making you turn your face to other sins. That classmate who scored an A on a test? What a bookworm, totally a joy killer. That girl who looks like a model? G’ah, she probably had a few plastic surgeries, she is so fake. The Envy rips you apart, making you both want and not want to be like other people; it leaves you in the limbo of stagnation, unable to improve. The Pride looks like your friend, but it’s the one bitch friend who stomps you into the dirt at the same. The Pride won’t let you take anyone’s help; what, are you a child, not being able to do such a simple thing on your own? It will snort at any attempt of yours to become better because, like, seriously? You think you are good enough? it will live you in a miserable position under a spotlight: rejecting any advice and anxiously attempting to do things you won’t manage alone. …All of them, however, bow under the reign of The Fear. Unironically, they fear it and eat off its hands; all the sins bow to it and borrow its powers. What are you afraid of? Being alone? Not letting things go? Being misunderstood or forgotten because of others? The Fear will gently embrace you and but you on its lap, sitting on the throne at the very top of the Tower of Babel: or a Tower of Anxiety, if you prefer.",2017
Redefining Anxiety in the Age of Trump,"One of the main rules that you learn in therapy is to accept the things you can’t control and realize that most of your anxiety is controllable — by you because you are the one with the power, not your anxiety. But that rule doesn’t apply to a Trump presidency. Every day is something more dreadful than the next. The Dakota Access Pipeline. The Muslim Ban. Chemical pollution of waterways. The deconstruction of the Affordable Care Act. The list goes on and on AND ON. It’s never-ending. For many, the realization that the majority of the next four years will be like this is just now settling in. The fact that I, as an individual, have little impact to chart any part of the next four years has settled. And, I’m fearful. I am so full of dread. I am so full of sadness. I feel that I am at a loss. In many ways, this era is a new chapter of my life. I am having to redefine my anxiety in the age of Trump. Yet, I’m struggling and, in many ways, succeeding in finding small, concrete things that I do have control over and using them to reach sturdier ground and help others if possible. I’m standing firm in my opinions. I’m donating money when I can. I am sharing information. I am joining the masses in the streets. I am talking to friends and strangers. I am telling people I love them more often. I’ve made so many strides in my anxiety in the last five years or so that to let myself be sunk by a man with no respect for anything or anyone but himself would be a tragedy that I refuse to allow a stage to play out. There are many others in my same position. I know I’m not alone, and I hope they know they aren’t either. As we redefine anxiety in the age of Trump, let’s remember that individual human agency is a powerful thing. Power doesn’t always come in pop and circumstance. Sometimes, it’s in the small, almost hidden things we say and do everyday. Looking to do your part? One way to get involved is to read the Indivisible Guide, which is written by former congressional staffers and is loaded with best practices for making Congress listen.

Blogging As Therapy,"When I started this blog last year it was out of desperation. I’d had several rounds of talking therapy that hadn’t proved successful and a brief episode on Fluoxetine that was even less so. Given my reluctance to lean on medication that harboured unpleasant side effects I felt lost and utterly hopeless. I was in an aggressively dark place and couldn’t see a way out, or a means to help myself. Then I started putting fingers to keyboard and the words flowed, like a cathartic brain purge. Getting the toxic thought processes out of my head and into the public domain was freeing, and every time I wrote it calmed me and I felt a great, but fleeting, sense of relief. The blog was for me, for my recovery. But then you started reading it. Then other people started to read it too, and then they started reaching out. My over-sharing brought with it a kinship with people all over the world who felt similarly and who were hanging in there as best they could. What started out as something that was necessary for my own sanity became something that linked me with incredible people, all of whom had their own crosses to bear. Managing to feel less alone and make meaningful connections under the miserable grey cloud of depression is something that’s been far more valuable than any therapy or medication has proven to be. I’ve made new friends and acquaintances and we’ve emotionally buoyed one another, whether it was over one quick exchange or many exchanges that are still happening. I’ve had an influx of new followers recently and it’s amazing to me that anyone cares what I have to say, or can find value or meaning in any of my words but it’s been wonderful to know that I’m not alone, that there are people out there who relate. When you’re in the thick of depression your World gets so much smaller, so for me, blogging has become a really beneficial tool to counteract that. Sometimes it’s easier to talk to a thousands strangers than it is to a friend. I guess what I’m trying to say is that asking for help can be the hardest thing in the World, especially when you don’t even know what to ask for; what would even make a difference. For me though, Getting my thoughts out of my head and onto the screen in front of me helps. Sometimes a little, sometimes a lot, but it’s made a difference. Even if you do it anonymously or no-one’s reading, it might be worth purging yourself of the voices inside your head giving you bad advice and telling you your worthless or ugly or a bad person, because they’re not to be trusted. You’re worthwhile and you will navigate a way out of this one day.",2017
There’s Nobody…,"Back in June of 2016, Eric Black at MinnPost did an excellent job rounding up many of the very humble claims Donald J. Trump has made. Of course since then, there’s been more. Here’s some of the recent biggies, but I’m sure there’s more about judges, the military, various minorities, etc. Please feel free to send ’em my way. Just trying to keep track. Not sure why. “There’s nobody that has more respect for women than I do.” “There is nobody that feels stronger about the intelligence community and the CIA than Donald Trump. There’s nobody.” “I am the least anti-Semitic person that you have seen in your entire life. Number two, racism. The least racist.” “There’s nobody I have more respect for — well, maybe a little bit but the reporters, good reporters.” “People are going to get this wrong — they always do. They always twist it, but I’ll just say there’s nobody who appreciates a good cat burglar more than me. You think about the skill. The quiet. The sometimes on the tippie-toes. The gems wrapped in velvet. Remarkable.” “There’s nobody who likes a barbershop quartet more than me. Show me the person. Or people. Is it an entity? Like a junior college somewhere? Maybe. We could sit and enjoy it together. I’m confident of that. But they wouldn’t like it more than me.” “There’s nobody who likes getting strep throat more than me. No one. I go right to my footie pajamas. And I know the best remedies. Doctors. They’ve struggled for years and they don’t even approach what I know about strep throat, but the funny part is I don’t even care. I just want to have it and deal with it and I embrace it.” “There’s nobody who likes arm wrestling more than me. But it has to be amateur. Like a long-haul trucker. He’s been driving all day. He’s parched. In the high Utah desert. Pulls over. Immediately challenged to arm wrestle a guy. Some jerk. A clown. They tango. I love it.” “There’s no one who like changing diapers more than me. Not a single person. Not a nanny anywhere. Step aside, bitch. I’ve fibbed about it in the past. Made myself seem irresponsible. Not anymore. Put me on the front lines.” “There’s nobody who thinks more about koala bear tongues than me. It’s an obsession. I’ll admit it. Guilty as charged. Ever see one? Unbelievable.” “There’s no one who thinks the name Madeline is cooler than I do. Every Madeline I’ve ever met has been a phenomenal human being. Wife material. What have you. I should have another daughter. I know what I’d name her.”",2017
5 Ways Meditation is Changing my Life,"About three months ago I began taking action against my anxiety (which had picked up strength over the last year). I started medication, and a week or two later, meditation. I picked up an app called Headspace. I love Headspace, even though there are a ton of similar products out there. I have, for 70 days in a row, taken 15 minutes out of each day to practice guided, mindful meditation using the Headspace app. And it’s changing my life. Before I tell you how it’s helping me, I want to debunk a few myths about meditation. These are assumptions I held that pretty quickly disappeared once I began the practice. I began this daily routine of meditating with a long-term goal. I hope to be able to learn how to deal with my anxiety using these natural tools and techniques so that I can eventually wean myself off of medication while enjoying the same quality of life as I’ve experienced while medicated. One thing I absolutely love about Headspace is that part of each session is to confirm your goal with yourself, but to put that in context of those around you. Combine that with the exercise as a whole, and I’ve already experienced five pretty major changes (*salutes Major Changes*): Look, I wasn’t super scientific about it. I started medication and meditation about the same time, which also happened to coincide with my work slowing down and being less stressful. So it is really difficult to dictate the source of these changes with any overwhelming confidence, but I can absolutely tell you meditation is a core component. I wish I would have known how powerful meditation was years ago. But I’m so happy I started when I did. I highly recommend it, and really, there’s no time to waste. Start today. Almost all the apps have free trials to get you through a week or so before you have to pay. And when you go shopping for apps, I encourage you to look for mindful meditation. You may be suited better for a different style, but I think you should give mindfulness a try, and if you want to test another style, maybe do that in conjunction with a mindful approach. I say this because it’s not the act of relaxing while meditating that’s helping me (in fact, after the first few days it stopped being super relaxing and became more of an exercise). It’s the mindfulness I pull from the exercise and apply to life that is changing my life. Go change yours. I’m pretty new to Medium.

“Agree” to the Chaos of Panic Attacks.,"Yesterday was one of the worst days in the history of my life. No tragic events took place. No catastrophes or terribly bad news. No It began in the morning with tightness in my chest. Shallow breathing quickly followed and with it a sense of doom. Like I was going down on the Titanic. The most beguiling part of it is there was no obvious cause. It felt as if a virus of fear and rage took control of my body, mind, and spirit. A gnawing of infinite terror eating its way from the inside out. Anger, sadness, worry, doubt spilled into every nook and cranny within my noggin. Tools I have learned to use and supported many others in applying to their lives became invisible. I felt possessed by some foreign entity, yet how did it get inside- invading my essence? Rather than attempting mindfulness practices of breathing. Or focusing on resources that have minimized things of this nature in the past, I wallowed in it. I dove into it the way a pig dives into slop. I ranted, cussed, and wrestled with it. I came out in worse shape than Leonardo did in “The Revenant” when he went one on one with the grizzly bear. If someone had tortured me it could not have felt worse. When this gale of pervasive panic finally subsided I was exhausted. After resting I examined where I had dropped the ball. I meditated this morning and looked at some of my core principles. One of those struck a nerve. In the book “The Four Agreements” author Don Miguel Ruiz discusses not taking anything personally. In fact that is the “second agreement.” He says, “the mind can talk to itself. Part of the mind is speaking and part of it is listening. It is a big problem when a thousand parts of your mind are all speaking at the same time. He calls this “mitote” or the chaos of when a thousand voices are all talking in one’s head simultaneously. Especially as none have anything positive to say. Normally this would mean not taking what other people say personally. Yet I wonder if I could apply the same principle to the fear (False Evidence Appearing Real) of a panic attack. Could the seismic intensity of the tsunami sweeping my brain lose its power if I focused on one voice? The voice of me on the verge of drowning in the cacophony of mitote. Obviously I‘ll never know in terms of yesterday’s shitstorm. However, I plan to cultivate more of Ruiz’s second agreement. If I do not take personally what the fiends in my head say. Yet rather look and listen for the voice of the real me, the authentic Paul, the part of my whole who is safe and knows it. Then perhaps any future tidal waves of anxiety fueled from the voices of toxic shame, guilt, and self doubt can diminish into a soft wave, lapping into the shore gently. As a result it shrinks into a narrow worry; noticed and released mindfully.",2017
Understanding Panic Attacks and Panic Disorder,"For a long time, I suffered from panic attacks and panic disorder. The same conditions that impacts about 3 percent of Americans. A panic attack is a sudden and overwhelming rush of anxiety and fear. During an attack, your heart pounds so hard you think it’s about to leap out of your chest. You can’t breathe and begin to hyperventilate. You may feel like you’re about to pass out, die or lose control. Image Credit: Canva Panic attacks can happen out of the blue, with no warning. You can be relaxed or even sleeping and still suffer a panic attack. Attacks could also be a one-time thing or be a frequent and unwanted visitor. Panic attacks usually happen as a result of a traumatic event. My traumatic incident was the night I wrecked my car in November 2000. After the accident things changed. Well, that’s not entirely true. For almost three months afterward, I was totally fine. Other than the stress that came with wrecking my car, and coming within a breath of meeting my Maker, I was just fine. I didn’t have any symptoms of PTSD. Heck, I even drove with no problems. I didn’t feel particularly stressed out. Well, no more than usual. Everything was under control. Or so I thought. Fast forward to February 2001. Valentine’s Day. I was driving to a job interview and… WHAM! I was hit. Not by a car. It was a panic attack. Right out of nowhere. I pulled onto the side of the road before my mind had a chance to register what was happening. Flight or fight had kicked in. My fear antenna was on high alert for danger. That’s anxiety for you. After a traumatic event, you may feel just fine for days, weeks or in my case months. Then WHAM, a panic attack grabs you by the throat. Most panic attacks last past 20 or 30 minutes. By then your body begins to relax, and the fight or flight antenna is no longer on high alert. A specific situation such as grieving a loved one, losing a job, making a life altering decision, crossing a bridge, or performing in public can trigger an attack. Often the event or situation is one where you feel trapped or endangered. If you’ve had a panic attack, you’re all too familiar these signs and symptoms. I suffered from a combination of sensations: •Hyperventilation •Heart palpitations or racing heart (This was one of my major symptoms.) •Discomfort in your chest or chest pain •Trembling or shaking •Tightening feeling in your throat •Feeling detached from the world around you ( I felt like I was living in a Twilight Zone episode) •Sweating •Ringing or plugged up sensation in one or both ears •Nausea or upset stomach •Feeling dizzy, light-headed, or faint (This was especially scary) •Numbness or tingling sensations all over your body (Mine occurred in my fingers and my thighs.) •Hot or cold flashes •Fear of dying, losing control or going crazy (Another big symptom for me!) Now that we’ve covered panic attacks let’s look at panic disorder. What’s the difference you ask? Having a few panic attacks here and there is one thing. But if you have frequent panic attacks you may be suffering from a panic disorder. Panic disorder, a type of anxiety disorder, can develop as a result of: •Having multiple and unexpected panic attacks. •Fear and worry about having another panic attack. •Avoiding places and doing things that have brought on panic attacks in the past. If panic attacks aren’t treated, you may develop agoraphobia. In the past, agoraphobia was linked to fear of wide open spaces or public places. Agoraphobia is actually a complication of having frequent panic attacks that lead to avoiding things, places, and situations that caused attacks. The more situations you avoid, the smaller your world gets. Soon the panic may get so bad that home may feel like the only safe place. Here are some situations and activities you may avoid if you have agoraphobia: •Going far away from home •Any physical exertion that you believe may trigger a panic attack •Restaurants, theaters, stores, or public transportation. In short, any place where you feel trapped. •Being around people such as a party or event where having a panic attack will be embarrassing for you. I have some great news for you. Panic attacks and panic disorder are highly treatable. Therapy sessions and self-help techniques can help you successfully manage symptoms. Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) is a very popular and effective treatment for panic disorder. CBT teaches your brain to change negative thought patterns. The therapy empowers you to change how you react to situations that trigger those panic attacks. This article provides more information on effective therapies for anxiety disorders. EFT or Emotional Freedom Technique is great for diffusing panic attacks. This video shows you how it’s done.

Is our obsession with physical fitness harming our mental health?,"Unlike a six-pack or bulging biceps, you can’t really see what a healthy mind looks like. This helps to explain why mental health is widely taken for granted. Chances are you haven’t given your own mental health much thought unless mental illness has touched you personally. Does your doctor ask you about it at your annual check-up? While breaking news stories are effective for rousing public conversation about mental health, they often do so in a sensationalized and inaccurate way. This leads people to mistakenly believe mental illness consists solely of serious conditions like bipolar disorder and schizophrenia. We forget that depression and anxiety are mental illnesses too, and although they aren’t as provocative, they’re far more common. It’s crucial that we start thinking about mental wellness when we talk about “health”. Many people don’t realize just how intensely their physical health is affected by their state of mind. According to the Canadian Mental Health Association, among other things, your mental health can greatly impact the following: This means even if you ate like a nutritionist and hit the gym like a professional athlete, your efforts could be dampened if you have poor mental health. If you asked anyone about their mental health, they’d likely tell you it’s fine and quickly change the subject. Unfortunately, most people are still very uncomfortable about discussing mental health. They’ll talk at length about their weight loss journey or why they love carbo-loading, but because there’s such a deep-rooted stigma surrounding mental disorders they might be inclined to clam up when asked about it. Why do we live in a society where it’s okay to openly discuss liposuction and crash dieting, yet bringing up therapy is frowned upon? The main reason is there’s a lot of misinformation about mental illness. People think it’s a sign of weakness or failure. They worry there’s no cure, or that techniques like therapy and meditation are too new-age to be effective. Another misconception is that these conditions are self-inflicted when in fact illnesses like PTSD arise from environmental and/or circumstantial experiences. These uninformed attitudes are dangerous and pose considerable barriers for those seeking support and treatment. Just like your body, your mind may begin to deteriorate if you don’t look after it. Mental illnesses can and do get worse without proper intervention, but the good news is there are many proactive measures you can take to keep your mind sharp — including reading, doing puzzles, and even exercising! We will explore more ways of promoting mental health in an upcoming blog post, but in the meantime here’s some further reading for you.

The Longest Week,"This week has felt never-ending. In the span of five days I’ve probably felt nearly every emotion that a person can: excitement, disappointment, anger, happiness, and then some. During weeks like this, I turn to music. I know that I’m not alone in that practice. Last night I spent over an hour downloading new songs so I could listen to them on the bus, on the way to school, and any other time I might need a distraction. When you’re listening to music there’s little else for your mind to focus on. Focus on the lyrics and commit them to memory if they aren’t already imprinted on your brain. Focus on the way the music makes your breathing steady. Focus, Focus, Focus. I hit a roadblock on Monday. I don’t know what exactly that roadblock is, but I know that it’s there. Every time I sit down to write the words escape me. Every time I try to read for school my mind refuses to register a single sentence. Every time I lie down in my bed to sleep, dreams wake me up at 4am. Something is off, but I don’t know what it is. So I have to let the problem work itself out. I suppose it’s time to take a deep breath and wait and see. For this week, this is my therapy:",2017
Work is work,"Customer service wreaks havoc on my anxiety. I dread coming to work every day. It feels like torture. What will the anonymous strangers ask of me? Will I be able to answer their questions correctly? Will they have a negative energy that will permeate its way into my fragile state and leave me with a black residue? Will I survive the dozens of interactions that I’m forced into, to earn my meager $250 a week? It hardly seems worth it. I show up because that is what is expected of me as an adult member of society. But I’m scared every day. I’m scared that my real purpose in life is passing me by while I wither away at the cash register. The book of poems I’m meant to write. The suffering addicts that I’m meant to counsel and help. The child I’m meant to birth and love and nurture. These destinies live only in my head. In my wishful heart. Any energy I would use to make them reality, to fulfill my potential, I use up by coming to work everyday. Maybe it just feels this way because it’s February. Maybe my energy is sapped because of the cold and the loneliness I wrap around myself for protection. Maybe when spring comes the poems will blossom out of me as though they have roots and nectar. But for now I wait. And try to smile while I ring up used books for $2 each and ask if they’d like a bag to help carry the weight today.",2017
Beat Your Social Anxiety,"I read a post on quora about an interesting exercise to help change yourself to become more social. The exercise works by identifying triggers that cause you to feel social anxiety and challenges you to work through them. Get a piece of paper. Make three columns and label them: Go ahead and spend the next 10 minutes thinking about events and actions which trigger these flighty feelings. They could be things like: “I get anxious when I drive on freeways” or “I get anxious when I have to ask for help in a retail store”. Don’t pick things that put yourself in any danger Now starting with the first column, “Things that make me anxious” see if you can confront these triggers crossing them out when completed. As you complete things that make you anxious, your brain will kick into overdrive and start adjusting to these confrontations. It’ll think to itself, “See that wasn’t too bad, I survived, I can do it again!”. Now move on to the next uncomfortable column, and then the last fear column. After you’ve completed everything in your columns, I promise you will be a more social person. Congratulations! I use a simplified form of this exercise. When I identify situations that make me uncomfortable, I push myself and break through it. For example, there are times when someone I don’t know very well is in the office kitchen. Normally I would tend to shy away, use the bathroom, or just wait until the person leaves before going in. From an observer’s perspective this is ridiculous right? Once I realize how limiting my behavior is, I can correct it. The challenge with using this technique, is you need to be aware of your mental state, and be able to respond quickly and break your conditioned habit. Good luck out there. Has this helped you? Or do you have a cool story to share? Please comment below!",2017

Depression Smashes the Brain’s Algorithms,"I know people who think depression and anxiety aren’t real afflictions. They think depression and anxiety are little more than claims made by malingerers to justify laziness and other signs of poor character. They think depression and anxiety can be cured with statements like “suck it up and deal with it” and “it’s all in your head” and “just get over it” and “pull yourself up by the bootstraps”. If only it was that easy. Unfortunately, it’s not. And there’s nothing you can say to a person who insists on being wrong. It doesn’t matter if they’re wrong as long as they find their position emotionally satisfying. For many people who think depression doesn’t exist, it’s extremely emotionally satisfying for them to think of themselves as mentally tougher and stronger than those lazy, malingering depressives who can’t suck it up and deal. You will never, ever get them to admit that they’re wrong. Clinical depression screws with your brain’s algorithms. What’s an algorithm? It’s a fancy word employed by malingerers, of course. No, no it’s not. An algorithm is just a set of instructions. Your brain uses them every day to accomplish simple tasks. In the morning you wake up, take a shower, and head off to work. A person who isn’t depressed can do this without even thinking about it. I imagine their thoughts look something like this: :::alarm clock::: Time to wake up… Shower… Head to work… And somehow they end up at work, all bright eyed and bushy tailed and ready to take on the day. They haven’t even started thinking yet. Here’s how the same algorithm might look inside of a depressed person’s head: :::alarm clock::: Open eyes. Lift arm to hit snooze button. Lie back down for 7 minutes. Close eyes. OMG did I really say that yesterday? What did everyone think after I said the thing I said? I am so ashamed of myself. :::alarm clock::: Lift arm to turn alarm clock off. Sit up on bed. Continue to worry about the thing I said. Why am I only wearing one sock? Where did my other sock go? Need to pee. Must walk to bathroom. One foot, then the other foot. Time to shower. Do I have a clean towel? Where are the towels? Are they here, or there? Do I need to go get a towel? Check for towels… Did I remember to flush the toilet? Do I have shampoo? Soap? How do I turn these knobs again for hot water? Cold water? Too hot, too cold. I am so ashamed of myself. Why am I overthinking a shower? Why am I thinking about every last detail of my shower? Why does it seem like it’s impossible to do anything without thinking about every last detail first? What is wrong with me? Why can’t I just do the things I normally do without thinking about every little detail? All of these details are overwhelming and impossible to deal with. I’d rather not. I will skip work and go back to bed and hope this goes away. People lose jobs over this shit when their brains fail to reach the end of simple, day-to-day algorithms. They become homeless. They lose faith in themselves and their ability to do anything to improve their lives. When you deny people the truth of their experience with depression or illness, you’re basically kicking them as hard as you can when they’re down, when they’re literally defenseless, all in the name of feeling superior. That’s about as violent and malicious as it gets, in my opinion. Depression is a real thing, and the one-sentence cures espoused by maliciously ignorant people do nothing to help the afflicted. When someone claims depression and anxiety are fake illnesses, he or she denies whole swaths of other people the truth of their experiences. If that’s something some people are proud of and derive pleasure from, then so be it. These people are legion. Their opinions aren’t popular here on the Internet, but they are as common as pennies out there in the “real world” of business and labor and human social reality. They are extremely difficult to avoid.",2017

Does My Heart Good,"A reminder that a little encouragement & forgiveness go a long way. Recently I got a note from a fan of my work telling me they appreciated my honesty and candor about my struggles with anxiety and mental health. It does my heart good to hear stories like that, of people who suffer like myself with the scepter of mental health issues; and how they too are working like to overcome them. Still it’s funny how you can go through bouts of anxiety and stress, but with a little determination you can make it through the situation. But still after so many years of living with anxiety and panic I still have to remind myself to get up every day and how every now-and-then I still fail.   So many times when we fail to overcome our panic we tend to abuse ourselves. In my situation this has always led to more guilt, more anxiety, and more self-doubt in my abilities. But once you take the steps to love the person that you are, you can begin to make the changes needed to create a fuller, happier life. Now I’m not going to sit here and tell you any of this shit is easy. But with a little patience and the right encouragement you can go a long way.   This morning in fact I woke up very anxious and stressed about a simple get away my wife and I will be taking next week. Even though the trip is a short car drive away (75 miles one-way) the idea of leaving the security of our home for an extended period still frightens me. But I’m determined to make the trip and although I know I’ll be anxious the whole way. I also know the closer I get to our destination the more relaxed I’ll feel, and by the end of the week I’m sure I’ll wish my stay was longer.   My point here is this, for those of us that live in a world where the simplest thing can cause panic and stress, remember this. No matter where you are right now, with a little determination and belief in yourself change will come. Even in the Bible the Good Lord can only do so much. It’s up to you to make the steps and except the gift. The same is true with reclaiming your life. First you have to realize the situation isn’t right, second have enough faith in yourself to change the situation, and then take the right steps to create change. Listen none of this is rocket science or some great mystery. It’s simply knowing your current situation isn’t right, then having the courage to change the situation, then understanding that none of us are perfect. But here’s the kicker, in order to make this thing work you have to learn to forgive yourself.",2017
The Power of “Me Too”,"An inspiring piece written by Robin Lynn June 2, 2015. 3:30pm. I was sitting in the waiting room for 3 hours. One hundred dollars is what the hospital deemed I was worth. They didn’t know my story. They didn’t know that I blamed myself for the hours of torment I had experienced the night before. They didn’t know I slept in the same clothes and had mascara-stained pillows that covered my bed. They didn’t know that it took almost everything I had not to completely unravel. Except, unraveling was a relative term, because in my head I had already unraveled. I became numb. I became paralyzed to what was happening around me. I got a few texts. I ignored them. I only wanted to talk to him. The one person I knew would be there to support me- but I was afraid of telling him at the same time. He had his own life, his own girlfriend, and yet he was my best friend — someone I could rely on to be there in my time of despair. It was almost like I had to whisper to the willows of the trees that stood still in the night. No one understood. The volunteer from the local rape counseling center was supposed to be there but even she was nowhere to be found. I was alone. In a cold waiting room watching the raindrop from the dark grey skies. I was paralyzed. Sitting there staring into space until I heard something. They called my name, took me into a 4 by 8 foot room with file cabinets, a hospital examination bed and a regular chair with a bathroom attached. First, they made me take off my clothes and give my underwear to forensics in case I would some day need them for evidence. Evidence? What evidence? I thought. There was no evidence. When I told him to get off and get out of me, and he replied “Wait, let me stay here a minute”, I could not move. What girl could move underneath a 220lb man? Yet, I didn’t move. I froze. I froze until my fight kicked in and I rolled out from underneath him and ran. He didn’t finish. He said it was my fault. Maybe that’s what I hated myself most for. Believing him. I spent the next 40 minutes undressing and getting a UV light shined to every art of my body. I don’t know about you, but I don’t like my body in the dark let alone with a UV light shining on every mark and territory that I thought would only be seen by the man I would marry. I was poked and prodded and given pills to prevent STDs and pregnancy that I gladly swallowed. They asked if I needed anything. What a silly question. Of course I need something. Something. Something like this never happening and for someone to look at me with understanding eyes of “I get it”. Someone to tell me it wasn’t my fault instead of asking “What did you do?” or “Sometimes people make mistakes”. Sure, sometimes people accidentally make mistakes. They don’t accidentally rape somebody. But somehow, that was wrong of me to think, and I was wrong. I was no longer a person. I was no longer a woman of value and of worth and of self-confidence. I was a rape victim. Someone who was a statistic. Someone who should have known better in my mind, and someone who I did not want to be. I wanted to be anyone else. I wanted to be the cop sitting in the waiting room next to me. I wanted to be the person outside waiting for the bus who just got a puddle of water splashed at them. I wanted to be anyone but thoughts that were crawling inside my head. Who was I even? I thought I had known. I thought I was confident in who I was as a person with my mission and values in life. And yet today, I sat in a hard blue chair with tears running down my eyes that no one would ever see. Tears that many people would never acknowledge were there after years of “healing”. Tears that people would later dismiss that I should be “over by now” and tears that would forever stain my heart. But, a year and a half later, I can safely say I’m not “over it”, nor do I think I ever will be. I can say with confidence, though, that I am healing. And I’ve had more courage in the last year to become the person I wanted to become than I would have ever had before. I’ve shared my story and by creating myrisestory.com, I have heard the two most important words I’ve ever heard in my life from more people than I can count: “Me too”. Me too. The woman I work with. Me too. The estranged acquaintance in the backseat of my car. Me too. The woman I grew up playing sports with. Me too. A colleague at breakfast. Me too. The stories are never-ending, and somehow I find comfort that I am not alone but rage toward the fact that this is still happening. I have shared my story and will not stop sharing it until awareness and efforts are being done to stop it. I will continue to help others through their mental health difficulties in my profession and will continue to work with kids through www.kcresolve.com. I will continue to be an online coach for those who don’t know what they are good at or need help finding their strengths through RISE Motivational Coaching. I will continue to make webinars based on topics that others can relate to. I will continue to make custom jewelry through The Rise Collection to spread awareness and raise money for charity. I will continue to write. I will continue to speak. I will continue to make it my mission to let others know they are not alone. I will not be quiet. I will rise.

Taming Anxiety,"Anxiety is an unwanted guest. A little parasite, she often comes in disguise to take root in your consciousness, then grows and grows, until she has her dirty claws entwined around it. Before blinking, you are trapped. You feel the claws closing in from all sides, reaching out for parts of you that you believed were yours. Why am I writing this? … because I feel it. Every day I try to kick a little demon from my doorstep. I know others do, too. By describing it, I want to turn something overwhelming into something systematic. I want to understand why and how it happens. Most importantly, I want to know what helps us get better. I want to know how we can fight. It may really start as something simple: a passing remark, a number on a scale, a deviation of routine, a pang of jealousy. A little drop in your ocean. A soft knock on your door. A planted seed. Over time, the seed develops. Of course, you feel it — but, because you are looking another way, you can’t see it. You don’t perceive that the growing plant is not any flower, but a weed. One that touches your memories and forms infective associations. Maybe that comment about my appearance was malicious? I feel much fatter, and I have been skipping gym recently because of work. Look at that pretty girl there eating cake. I bet she doesn’t have these thoughts. I wish I was her. Life must be so simple. The demon takes root and grows, spreading through your world. Now, for many of us that are fortunate enough, our stress indicators get noticed by ones that care. We try our best, but, as the problems grow, we can’t keep up a smile as the demons expose themselves. It’s more than stress. You jitter. You tap the table. Your thoughts dance in bloody circles. You become violent, and might turn to abuse. This is where you try to explain how it all began, and where, sometimes, stumbling over your own fallacies, you reach a state of confusion. I feel …, but I know … . There is no harmony. What many of us, and our loved ones, will attempt now is to try to push the problem back to its original size. It’s not so bad. You’re not seeing things clearly. However, from my experience, this is like untangling a thousand wires, or cutting the branches of a tree. It’s hard to fix the brain based on the premise that it is wired incorrectly, and without a blueprint that shows how it should interact with the body and the world. What is worse, the leech might feed on its own remains and reincarnate. The next time you face this, take a step back. Look at the implications of your thoughts. When was the seed planted? Will this way of thinking help? How big is the problem really, relative to everything else in life? Upon others, spread kindness and light, by lifting the blinds and helping them see that there is more in the world beyond. Calm down and have a tea. Let me give you a hug for good-night. It’s a sunny day outside. You have done a good job. Each of us afflicted are held in a dark cage as the poison is slowly injected. Rather than banging against the bars, let’s try to remember the life beyond the cage; because the demons are not really there — they’re in our minds.",2017
Life on Zoloft,"Today marks half a year since I started medication. For me, it’s akin to the first time I put on glasses and marveled at the individual stones in the pavement, and that there were separate lights that form together to light up a traffic light. Life is clear, not entirely but more so. I was really fucked up by the time I got help. I suffer from Generalized Anxiety Disorder and depression from sexual abuse I endured as a child. I’ve repressed most of my childhood memories, even up into my teen years. I never really got to be a kid. I finally started help in high school after my boyfriend at the time forced me to tell my parents about the abuse. That was its own ordeal in itself. I was whisked into therapy and eventually started on Prozac, which gave me migraines and was immediately stopped before I could really give it a chance to work. I remember going back to my psychiatrist and asking if there were any treatments I could do besides pills, such as aromatherapy or meditation. He laughed in my face and I never went back to see him again. My second attempt at help was six months ago. I went for years trying to just deal with my symptoms. I lost a lot of weight and it boosted my self confidence and the exercising I was doing did wonders for my serotonin levels. I felt on top of the world. I still struggled with my emotions though, and I began to experience restlessness and racing thoughts, but I chocked it all up to stress. Last year I began to hallucinate. I would hear things, see things that weren’t there. I would feel faint under stress, breaking into a cold sweat and losing my hearing. I had a mental breakdown at work and my boss let me take the day off to go see a therapist. We got me back into therapy sessions and I decided to try medication again. I knew if I didn’t try something, I’d be found dead by the end of the year. I gave it my all. It wasn’t immediate, but with perseverance I noticed how clear my mind was after a few weeks. Things that would normally send me into a panic attack were no big deal. I was more focused, I was able to get things done in a productive manner. I was more rational, more thoughtful, more peaceful. It’s embarrassing to look back on how I acted pre-medication, because at that time I could not tell right from wrong. I acted on selfish desires carelessly. I sabotaged relationships and burnt bridges. Now I have more willpower to do whats best for me and for others around me. I take care of my self more. I’ve been given a second chance at life. If you liked my writing, please consider helping me out with a kofi. :)",2017
The Perfect Vagina,"The New York Post, or the New York Times for tweekers, reports that a “designer vagina showcase” was held in Manhattan this week. No, we are not stuck in one of Donald Trump’s wet dreams. The event was led by Dr. Amir Marashi, who “specializes in vaginal cosmetic surgery.” He says he’s worked on over 400 vaginas. His mom must be proud. I mean, even Hugh Hefner’s like, “Okay, I’m not that horny.” According to the article’s writer, “the perfect vagina is pink, plump and hairless.” Exactly. Your vagina should have the erotic beauty of an infant’s butt. I make more bad jokes about this here, but I think the event illuminates a central truth about comedy. The “designer vagina showcase,” which is also the scientific name for PornHub, isn’t that much of a surprise. This is clearly the product of a patriarchal culture that values female beauty to a psychotic degree. It’s the epic sequel to anal bleaching. But people do this kind of stuff all the time. We need perfection like Chris Christie needs Red Lobster. Why? Because being vulnerable is fucking hard. Alright, emo time: I find it very difficult to accept who I am. I wish I could just be the person I want to be: someone social, confident, funny, saying all the right things at the right time to the right people in the right way. I wish I could just be perfect. But chasing that sort of perfection — where there’s no room for awkwardness and shyness and weakness and dumbness — only leads to self-loathing and shame. Because, no matter how perfect I want to be, I will always be a person. And people are imperfect. Karen Horney puts it best: The actual, empirical self becomes the offensive stranger to whom the idealized self happens to be tied, and the latter turns against this stranger with hate and contempt. The actual self becomes the victim of the proud idealized self… So, no matter how frantically our Pygmalion tries to mold himself into a being of splendid dimensions, the fact remains that he has to live with himself. Whether he eats, sleeps, goes to the bathroom, whether he works or makes love, he is always there. In other words, you can try to make your vagina perfect, but it’s still a fucking vagina. And guess what? We’re all vaginas. Comedy is what happens when we admit that, you know what, I’m not perfect. I’m flawed. I do awkward, embarrassing shit all the time because… I am a fucking vagina. Or a penis. Or an anus. Or Kid Rock. Indeed, comedy is truth and pain. Right, Brené Brown? Imperfections are not inadequacies; they are reminders that we’re all in this together. Exactly. So keep your ugly vagina. But fix your face. That’s just gross.",2017
The loss of a relationship,"Nancy had been with Ben for a while and they loved each other. They had met during a statistics lecture which was an elective for both of them. I should mention here that Nancy was a year ahead of Ben though Ben was about three years older then Nancy. These two loved each other(at least so they felt and told each other) and would always meet at the end lectures to talk about their day. They were both active on campus hence popular amongst students with Ben leading the pack. He was the guy many ladies would hail each time he walked to the lecture theater. This irked a few of his friends that they stopped walking with me. No wonder Nancy was taken aback when Ben came toasting. Ben had left school one weekend to attend to some matters thereby leaving his sweetheart all alone to attend her final year dinner. It was to perhaps be a costly mistake. At his return, everything had changed and that week, the following Sunday precisely, Ben got his copy of a 'Dear John’s Letter’.This was the beginning of the end for Ben. He was admitted into the hospital that day and would be there for a week.The next years were not to be the same. He would always have flashes and memories of the times spent together.The lunch times, the screaming moments and the happy moments. He was beginning to see his lost love in every lady that came along his path. It was a mixture of joy and sadness. Anger, resentment, dislike for every lady around him, lack of trust in any form of relationship, emptyness, feeling of lack of worth became his partners along the way.********************************* Breakups are never easy. The end of a relationship can flip your world upside down and trigger a range of emotions. Some people quickly accept the demise of a relationship and move on, but others may deal with depression. This can be a heartbreaking time, and it can feel as if your world is falling apart. But while sadness and a heightened emotional state are normal reactions after a breakup, it’s important to recognize the symptoms of depression.Since symptoms of depression can range from mild to severe, it’s often difficult to know whether sadness and grief are a normal reaction to a breakup or a sign of something more serious like depression. It’s okay to grieve the loss of a relationship as you begin the healing process. But this doesn’t suggest that every emotion you feel is a normal reaction. There are healthy and unhealthy symptoms of a breakup. Knowing the differences between these symptoms can help you determine whether you’re experiencing depression.Healthy symptoms of a breakup may include: - anger and frustration- crying and sadness- fear- insomnia- loss of interest in activities These symptoms are troublesome. But if you’re experiencing a normal reaction to the breakup, your emotional state will improve little by little as you adjust to life without your partner. The amount of time it takes to heal varies for each person, so be patient. While it’s normal to feel sadness and pain after a breakup, you should speak up if your symptoms don’t start to improve after a few weeks, or if they get worse. To be diagnosed with depression, you must experience at least five of the following nine symptoms for a period of at least two weeks: - feeling sad, empty, or hopeless for most of the day nearly every day - loss of interest in activities you once enjoyed - weight loss and loss of appetite, or increase of appetite and weight gain - sleeping either too little or too much - an increase in movements like pacing or hand wringing, or having significantly slower speech and movement - feeling as if you have no energy for most of the day - feeling worthless - difficulty concentrating or making decisions - thoughts about death, also called suicidal ideation Depression can happen to anyone after a breakup, but some people are at greater risk. The cause of depression varies, but you may experience these feelings if you have a personal history of depression or another mood disorder. Other factors that may contribute to depression after a breakup include hormonal changes or simultaneously enduring another major change in your life, such as a job loss or the loss of a loved one. P. S. Please the idea isn't to focus on the relationship but how the end of one can bring about depression. P. S. 2 : depression could also bring about the end of a relationship. P. S. 3 : yo can read my writeup on Dear John on medium",2017
Be anxious…for nothing,"I am your average worry wort. No…not average. More like above average. Make that way above average. Rather I used to be and until recently, I worried about almost everything. Take this scenario for instance: I get a text that I have an interview the next day, I immediately start to worry that I might get to the venue late or I’ll forget one of my certificates or documents or i’ll get lost on my way and end up somewhere outside Lagos state or something. My brain would definitely cook up something to make me go out of my mind with anxiety and fear and worry. Now it’s possible to argue that almost anyone can worry about an interview so let me give another scenario: I have to go to the store or market. I start to worry that I might not have enough money to pay for what I buy or that the money I have would be stolen and I will be stranded or I might have an accident and end up in a hospital or something much worse. Funny thing is all these thoughts flood my sub conscious at a mile per second and then I start to make plans to make sure none of my worry simulations come to pass. I double check and triple check that my documents are with me, I put my money in several places apart from my purse and make sure I consult google map and my personal map which I call Ayomap (Ayo is my amazing friend who knows Lagos Mainland like the back of her hand) to find the routes and also write them down on paper so that if my phone develops a fault or the battery runs down or my network becomes more crappy than usual (trust Nigerian network at your own peril) and I can’t access either of my maps, I would still find my way. My father made sure I and my siblings cultivated the habit of reading at a really young age, and one of the books I read was Tim LaHaye’s Why you act the way you do and at that time, it did not help my excessively worrying self. The book talks about the four major human temperaments and I found out that I have a bit of melancholy in me. There I read about the worrying melancholy. An average melancholy worries twice as much or even much more than any other temperament and mine was to the extreme. So after reading that, I felt oh well, it’s my temperament and continued my worrying, taking it to even greater heights. Fast forward some few years later and I found the book, read it again and discovered a different understanding from the last time I read it. Tim LaHaye never once wrote that the characteristics of each temperament was written in stone. He never insinuated that because this is a characteristic of any temperament, changing or breaking away from it was impossible. He in fact admonishes several times during the book to let the Holy spirit of God guide you into making the best of your temperament which led me to the scripture in Philippians 4:6 that is also the title of this article: Be anxious for nothing. To me, be anxious for nothing means to not worry. It means to not try to micro manage every situation and simulate every angle but instead live my life enjoying the moment and experience. So what if I lose a document (silently praying that never happens to me though), so what if my purse full of money and cards gets stolen and I am left stranded (sadly that has happened to me), so what if my phone is turned off and I don’t have access to any map (when it did, I asked people around me for direction and walked a lot!). I literally won’t die, time would definitely not stop and the earth would most definitely keep rotating on its axis. With that in mind, I decided to take a chill pill, reduce my anxiety attacks, let go and trust in God to see me through it all. In summary and conclusion, I will part with this revised quote that gets me going when the fingers of worry try to caress me back into the fold: “On a scale of 1–10 of world disasters, yours isn’t even a 0.1 so live some more, Amase (yes, I call myself by my last name) and be anxious… for nothing.”",2017

PublicPills First,"Like many, many out there, I started taking medication a couple of years ago. It worked for me. First day I remember speaking with the pharmacy lady, who let me know how this ‘new’ decision of taking medication could help me out for a better life quality. She saw how panicked I was. Although I had the prescription in my hand to buy these amazing- research approved latest pills, I felt that she was the one that had power over my decision of buying them at that moment. My very private conversation in the psychiatrist office, was no longer private. I felt exposed to her — publicly — as if she could see through me all my negative thoughts and internal dialogue. I thought ‘SHE KNOWS’ and now it is public. Everyone knows something is wrong with my head. my mind. my emotions. ME. not sure in what order. I would interact with her once more after she called a week later to find out how I was doing. I do not know if this was a standard call but vaguely remember her explanation, due to the kind of medication I got they needed to call a week after to find out how I was doing. I have NO idea what her name was. But I will never forget her call. I have taken medication, for anxiety/depression, since that day. I recall telling her it was horrible. First day I felt groggy, tired and did not want this in my body, or my mind. And yet with time my body adapted. Years later, about 7 now, I have decided to stop taking them. I also decided to share, writing, what the process is like for me, and know there are many that go through a similar situation. I welcome all comments, thoughts and suggestions.",2017

How meditation helped me get a handle on compulsive thoughts,"“You can hide ‘neath your covers / And study your pain” — Bruce Springsteen, Thunder Road Having driven my car from Pennsylvania to California, here I was sitting in the bleachers of a small theater in Los Angeles, taking my first improv class with the storied Upright Citizens Brigade. I had made it! The dream I had — of spending the summer exploring my interests — was finally coming to fruition. And yet, as I sat with my classmates while our instructor shared yet another nugget of his (boundless) improv wisdom, rather than focusing on him, my attention was 100% trained on — my little pinky. You see, at some point in the previous weeks, I noticed that when I angled my wrist in a certain way, and tried to bring my pinky closer to my other fingers, it trembled. Fear surging through my body, struck with panic, my mind raced around until it latched on to a startling conclusion: my trembling pinky is a sign of a neurological disorder. I must have MS! Or Parkinson’s. This routine, of feeling that something in my body was amiss and pegging it on one ailment or another, had repeated itself many times prior, and continued to in the years that followed. Be it gum disease, a heart condition, diabetes, an STD, restless leg syndrome, you name it — if I could find a pretext for it, I found a way to worry about it. Gorgeous sunny days spent in a state of panic. Conversations with friends or family where my body was physically present but my mind locked in an intense medical self-investigation. And when I got the all-clear from a medical professional (as I did from a neurologist for my pinky): an intense sense of calm. Hallelujah! I’m okay! And, inevitably, in the days that followed: the surfacing of a new fear. With the patient ear of a mentor, and a therapist skilled in Cognitive Behavioral Therapy, over the years I found a way to make sense of this two-step I danced. I came to understand how investigating these illnesses (damn you Google & WebMD!) fed my fears, rather than diminished them. How, often, my compulsive thoughts were themselves symptoms of other— completely unrelated — unresolved issues in my life. Such as a work assignment that intimidated me. Or how I was going to stay afloat financially while working as a freelancer. In addition to helping me make sense of my habits, my mentors also gave me some tools to help me to avoid falling into the trap I was so good at laying for myself. One such tool was meditation. Now I knew that meditation generally helped manage stress. And I had felt some of its benefits in the (sporadic) practice I had developed. But it was in developing a daily practice over a couple of years that I’ve come to know how to relates to getting a handle on my compulsive thoughts. First, meditation gave me a better shock-absorber. Ever driven down a bumpy road in an SUV? Pretty smooth right? Coffee in one hand, drumming the steering wheel to a good beat with the other, life is good. Now have you ever driven down a similar road in a sports car? The coffee quickly turns into a Frappuccino. Hands are white-knuckled just to keep your car moving in a straight line. Just like a sports car has more tightly wound shocks (for better handling at high speeds), my mind and body too were tightly wound (for better freak-outs). Any external stimulus (such as an errant thought about a disease I might have) and I had little capacity to deal with it. It instantly jumped into crisis mode. Meditation afforded me the ability to recognize the feelings that such thoughts elicit and, rather than react to them when they came up (by say, freaking out, Googling symptoms, booking a doctor’s appointment, or (often) all three!), I learned to stay with them. Funnily enough, as I did, the feeling had a way of dissipating. Like putting a sugar cube in water. Second, by helping me get better in dealing with scary thoughts and emotions, meditation gave me a greater capacity to look squarely at uncomfortable questions in my life — questions I artfully swept under the rug, but that in practice lurked under the surface and “acted out” by triggering my compulsive thoughts. Dreading an upcoming work assignment? What part of it was dreadful to me? Fearful of how I am going to work for myself and pay my rent? Well, what is my financial strategy? Maybe some financial planning is in order after all. And wouldn’t you know it — the more I’ve looked into such questions — the fewer freak-outs I’ve had. I sometimes see meditation portrayed — in Instagram snapshots and glossy check-out-line magazines — as this wonderful luxury to indulge in, preferably while outfitted in Lululemon™ and surrounded by floating votive candles. As if it were some sort of chocolate truffle, to be savored when convenient. Perhaps that’s true for some, and for me there is little glamour in the practice of meditation. I’ve recognized that this “pattern” of compulsive thoughts is deeply ingrained in me and — without proper care and feeding — will resurface. Much like an alcoholic is one for life — no matter how many years they’ve been sober — I am forever really good at having compulsive thoughts. And much like a drug for depression can help restore a chemical imbalance in the brain, for me meditation helps break the connection between my thoughts — the emotions they elicit — and the pre-programmed actions that ultimately get me stuck. It’s a prescription. Knowing full well that if I stop my practice I’ll be “off my meds” and, while I’ll have added a few free minutes to my day, sooner or later I’ll be right back where I started. Though I do sometimes light a candle. Questions? Comments? Tips and tricks that have worked for you? Hit me up below! Oh and how did the improv course go? I learned that improv is really, really hard. But Jason Alexander (George Costanza from Seinfeld) happened to be in the audience for our class show! A character who I suspect knows a thing or two about compulsive thinking.",2017
Here’s What a Severe Panic Attack Feels Like,"I’m at lunch, ordering my food, but I feel wrong. I’m sweating and there’s a tingling sensation throughout my body. I want to go to the bathroom and splash cold water in my face, but there is no bathroom, so I go back and stand by the counter to wait for my food. Next thing I know I’m on the ground on my side. There are several people I don’t recognize standing around me. “Are you with us?” “Can you hear me?” I am, and I can, but I can’t speak. I nod. I recognize that there is chaos going on around me, and I’m the center of it, but I’m barely conscious. I don’t know how long I’ve been out and I don’t know exactly what’s going on. Eventually I remember the feeling that preceded it and I can piece together that I must have lost consciousness, which has never happened to me before. The strangers are still with me, reassuring me, telling me I’m going to be alright. My friend and coworker is frantically making phone calls. He doesn’t know what’s happened. No one does. Some time later there are medical responders. They’re asking me my name, my birthdate, what year it is. I manage to answer, but I can only eke out one word at a time, with what seems like extraordinary effort. Sometimes I start to speak and I lose energy and stop. My eyes are closed. Someone tells me to open them. The light is blinding, and now there’s a flashlight in my eyes that I’m told to follow. I’m able to do it. So I haven’t had a stroke and I can move my eyes in sync. I know these are good signs. I’m lifted up into a wheelchair. The medics use words I don’t understand. None of it sounds good. I hear someone say an ambulance is 10 minutes away. I’m told to keep my eyes open. I hear someone say, “Well, you bought yourself an IV,” and a needle goes into my wrist. I feel it, but it doesn’t register as pain. There’s a serious lag between what I sense and my ability to respond to it. I hear the ambulance siren approaching and for the first time in my life I realize that siren is coming for me. This is a very weird realization. I’m lifted onto a stretcher and taken outside and wheeled to the ambulance. It seems like we’re going for blocks. I’m told to get into the ambulance. I can barely stand. I feel like I have no strength at all, and they have to grab both my arms and help me up. I manage to stagger to the stretcher and flop down on it. My eyes are still open but I can’t look at anything for too long because I’m having strange visual hallucinations. Perspectives are all off. The ambulance interior seems stretched, like it’s a foot wide and ten feet tall. Everything is moving in a jumpy, disconcerting manner. They’re asking more questions, and I answer them all, with great difficulty. I’m able to move my feet so I know I’m not paralyzed. I know who I am and I know what’s going on, so I know I’m not in terrible shape. I’m still sweating, and I hear one of the medics comment on it. I can feel that my shirt is soaked through. They help me off with it and start adhering wires to my chest and abdomen. At this point I know it’s a panic attack, and I want to say the words “I know what this is,” but nothing comes out. At one point I manage to say to my friend, “Tell me I’m going to be okay,” which he, and others, have been telling me. I desperately need to hear these words some more, but I’m not sure he hears me. I feel exhausted and I want to close my eyes but I know I shouldn’t. I want to ask someone, “Is it okay if I go to sleep?” but I feel certain that if I close my eyes I’ll never open them again. My hold on life feels tenuous at best. In my head I’m telling myself, “this is a panic attack. It will stop. You’re not dying,” but I feel like I’m dying. I’m sure I’m dying. I feel my body getting cold and I’m even more sure I’m dying, so I keep repeating to myself, “this is a panic attack,” although the only sounds I’m making are moans and gasps. I’m wheeled into the ER and put into a small room. A doctor asks me more questions; I answer them all, but only with tremendous effort. Eventually he asks if this has happened to me before and I nod. He asks, “Is it like a panic attack,” and I say “exactly.” Now he knows what he’s dealing with and I hear him say something about giving me something for the panic. This is apparently done through my IV because the only thing I’m given to swallow is two potassium pills. I’m told my potassium is low, so I swallow them. I’m still hallucinating. Everything’s jumping about wildly so I keep moving my eyes from one thing to the next. I see trails when people walk by. My sense of perspective is still out of whack. At some point a man appears with a clipboard and some papers; he needs my signature on my admitting forms, “If I can.” I manage to scrawl something resembling my signature, and am dimly aware of the absurdity of this scene; there’s always time for paperwork. After a while I’m taken up to my room and I’m told they’re going to give me a chest x-ray and a CAT scan. I’m still barely conscious. I’m still only partially aware when they wheel in the x-ray equipment and have me sit upright. Some time later I get wheeled to the CAT scan machine, which I’m slid into and out of in what seems like no time. I remember having an MRI previously, but this is much faster than that. I’m taken back to my room and eventually I feel myself relaxing. A while later I’m finally able to speak without effort and I realize I have my strength back. I look at the clock and it’s 7 P.M. It’s been six-and-a-half hours since I went unconscious, and only now do I feel like I’ve fully come to. ************* Every panic attack is different. I had one 20 years ago, but I never lost consciousness, I just laid on my couch for six hours trying not to die. This time was similar in the way it came on, but far more severe and terrifying. I’ve had other, smaller ones in the intervening years, but always managed to self-talk and breathe my way out of them rather quickly. The whole event still seems like a dream, but some things I remember clearly. The amazing kindness of the strangers in the restaurant who consoled me and stayed with me until the medical techs arrived. “You’re gonna be alright, buddy. Hang in there. Everything’s alright.” The heroic professionalism and competence of the responders who tended to me and reassured me at the same time. My friend who rode with me to the hospital and told me I was going to be okay, even though I’m sure he was freaking out worse than I was. Mostly I remember being in the ambulance, telling myself “this is just a panic attack,” but also not knowing for sure that’s all it was. I remember thinking, “This is how it happens.” Something goes wrong. You’re put into an ambulance and you have no idea what’s going on. You concentrate on staying alive, but you know that it’s not really something you can control. “This is how it happens.” No one explains it to you, you can’t even ask questions, you just try to hold on, but what if you can’t? What if you can’t keep your eyes open? ************* It still seems strange to me that these episodes are referred to as panic attacks, because the feeling is not at all what you think of when you imagine panic. It doesn’t feel like an adrenaline rush, although there is one (my heartbeat was greatly elevated); it actually feels like the opposite of an adrenaline rush — you feel powerless, frozen, trapped inside your own body. Even though you can breathe, you’re certain you can’t. Even though you are in control of your movements, it feels like you’re not. It’s as if your body has shut down completely and your mind isn’t far behind. If you’ve never suffered a panic attack, be grateful, and if you know anyone who has had a panic or anxiety attack, realize they’re not talking about being worried or scared. These things are many, many levels of fear above those everyday, and comparatively benign, emotions. I don’t recommend it. ************* There’s good information about panic/anxiety attacks here and here, and this piece is a good illustration of the different ways panic attacks can manifest.",2017
"Nonverbal Communication Analysis №3853: Tom Hiddleston, a School Play and Eddie Redmayne — Body Language and Emotional Intelligence (VIDEO, PHOTOS)","It seems that once upon a time, Tom Hiddleston and Eddie Redmayne were in a school play together. In this video, Hiddleston recounts the childhood experience. Although we often tend to think of them as ‘good liars’ — for we want them to suspend our disbelief — when they are not ‘in character’ (when they are ‘in their own skin’) actors are no better at fooling us than the average person. In the first few seconds of the above video, Hiddleston develops anxiety when Graham Norton brings up the subject of the school play. Tom rapidly becomes embarrassed — evidenced by his blushing (easy to see despite the orange-red background) and a sincere smile — albeit a suppressed one. In this image captured above Hiddleston displays relaxed forehead muscles, partially closed eyelids, lower eyelids with concave-up dynamic furrows, upward vectored and contracting cheek muscles. And yet none of his teeth are on display, for his lips are tighten while he tries not to laugh (or fully smile). Hiddleston is also reaching for his nose. The most common cause for touching of one’s face is anxiety (regardless of its degree or the specific cause) — and the vast majority of times (98+%), we are not even aware we’re doing so. While the touching of the nose may be correlated with deception — this is not true for all hand-to-nose contact. When the nose is pulled or pinched between the thumb and forefinger (index finger) it too indicates anxiety — but more specifically it signals a ‘dialing up of alpha qualities’. The psyche recognizes the need for an up-regulation to stronger, more assertive qualities — and the action of this MAP (Manipulator, Adaptor, Pacifier) helps us to do so. It’s analogous to a slap in the face or a splash of cold water causing one’s emotions to be ‘jump started’ and thus redirected. The nose pinch/nose pull is but one many examples of alpha up-regulators. What others can you name?

To Admit You’re Drowning,"As someone who used to competitively swim, I really enjoyed spending time under water. I enjoyed how blurry the edges of my vision were, how everything felt slow and just a bit delayed, and how being surrounded by the element felt against my skin. I never imagined feeling those exact same things outside my exam room when I had my panic attack and feeling absolutely terrified. This entire week has been shitty with priorities: every day there was either an assignment due, a midterm to take, or both, and sometimes double that. The beggining of the week has had me hastilly finishing my assignments while studying for midterms on top of attending classes I could barely focus in unless I wasn’t thinking about deadlines. While in theory my bullet journal prepared me for all of the due dates of my school commitments, I neglected to pencil in how anxious I would feel as each day came by and that I would get my period on Wednesday. The morning of my period I missed my geomorphology lab, mainly because my uterus wouldn’t allow me to move anywhere until I got pain medication in me. The first day of my period is always painful, and I’ve honestly gotten used to feeling the excrutiating cramps and then going about my day. For some reason, despite doing my usual cramp prevention routine of taking advil and keeling over the toilet for an hour, nothing had work and I had begun to feel lightheaded. I had one midterm to go to at two in the afternoon, which I was determined to go to, but the pain and lightheadedness got to be so much that worrying boyfriend I had been updating rushed home to assess the situation. He found me crouching on the floor after I tried to pack up my things and did his best to get food in me and get me walking. We managed to get me to the building where my exam was via public transport, and the outside cold and the general walking made me feel a lot better. Outside my exam room, my boyfriend and I sat down so I could study. Hundreds of students waited outside the exam room, conversations here and there about the exam, it was a general stressed out vibe. The professor came around and said she’d be putting up a seating chart as soon as the other class cleared out of the room. I looked up and found the edges of my vision blurry. I remember hearing three distinct layers of sound: the loud murmur of my classmates as blurry background noise, my boyfriend’s voice sounding slightly delayed, and the sound of my heart pumping fast from I don’t know what. When my eyes moved to focus on something, my vision felt delayed and I had to hold myself because I felt weird and light headed. I started to feel my insides sweating and shaking, under my skin. I looked up at my boyfriend with probably a look of panic, “I can’t do this”. What followed was my body and mind slowly shutting down as my boyfriend talked me through what we had to do: talk to the professor about missing my exam to get a doctor’s note, and get the fuck out of there. I had rehearsed what I was going to say to my professor seven times before I told her, feeling . She was understanding and let me go, noting on how I looked like I needed to get out of the room as soon as possible. After an hour wait in the walk-in clinic I had managed to calm down, but I had begun to feel exhausted from all that had happened in the last few hours. Boyfriend and I rehearsed what I would say to the doctor, more so I could internally analyze what happened than for getting a doctor’s note. I have never been properly diagnosed because bad experiences with doctors hold me back from making an appointment, but the closest thing I feel my personal struggles relate to are anxiety, or at least some form of it. I never saw it as a big issue that would impede my performance in academics or extra curriculars because I’m generally able to regain my composure quickly if I need to, and the fact that I’ve been able to deal with it for so long, why try to change something and have it end up not working? This isn’t the first time I had stressed to the point of what seems like a panic attack, and the fact that this time I wasn’t able to “just deal with it and keep going” was something that surprised me and made me feel vulnerable. I never really publicly talk about my mental struggles or seek help outside of those close to me for a few reasons, mainly because I frankly thought people didn’t care enough outside of knowing me as a good friend or student leader. I’m involved with a lot of groups and organizations, and nothing gives me more joy than being thanked for the work I do or being looked up to as a leader. I get so much gratitude in the things that I do for people, that I forget myself most, if not all of the time. Along with growing up in a household that didn’t believe in mental illness, I find it difficult to speak up about my struggles or even believe myself that I should seek help. But, nevertheless, I’m trying. I had wanted to write about this for sometime now, but never really found a good “moment”. I had always wanted to participate with all of those that participated in days like #BellLetsTalk or mental health awareness-like events, but never had the courage to put something properly into words much less overcome the fear of being judged by those who see me as someone who “has their life together”. Avoiding professional help and internalizing your struggles, you begin to think whether you’re actually struggling and maybe you’re just making it up as an excuse for attention or to be lazy. How immense does avoidance have to be to fully convince yourself that nothing’s wrong for the past five years? The more I avoided, the more I convinced myself that I didn’t need to reach out. If I could do this for x amount of years, I can surely do it for another, right? I never realized the importance of being open and honest about what I’m facing with until my close friends saw me struggling and did what they can to help. I’m forever grateful for their understanding and giving me the support I needed to get through the day, and makes me wish I reached out to the close friends and resources for help when I needed it previously. Not only did it really show how amazing the friends I’ve made in university are, it validated my feelings and struggles. It validated me. If I get anything out of writing this, I just hope someone reads and decides to reach out for help on whatever they’re struggling with. Maybe that person is me, and I’ll feel just as fulfilled.",2017
Careless in the Care of God,"Anxiety — living inside a cloud, every thought is consumed by worry and what-ifs, every thought, every action is second-guessed, and anything that could possibly go wrong will probably go wrong. Anxiety — when your stomach flips over and drops like a roller coaster — chilling, rushing waves of fear overwhelming your mind and body. Anxiety — when all you don’t want to think about is all you can think about. When you are too exhausted to think about anything but what exhausts you. Trapped in a mental cage with the elephant in the room and it’s trampling you — this is anxiety. Like all problems we face in life, anxiety finds its solution in God. We can be set free from anxiety. Hear these words of hope from Jesus: “Therefore I tell you, do not be anxious about your life, what you will eat or what you will drink, nor about your body, what you will put on. Is not life more than food, and the body more than clothing? Look at the birds of the air: they neither sow nor reap nor gather into barns, and yet your heavenly Father feeds them. Are you not of more value than they? And which of you by being anxious can add a single hour to their span of life? And why are you anxious about clothing? Consider the lilies of the field, how they grow: they neither toil nor spin, yet I tell you, even Solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one of these. But if God so clothese the grass of the field, which today is alive and tomorrow is thrown into the oven, will he not much more clothe you, O you of little faith? Therefore, do not be anxious, saying, ‘What shall we eat?’ or ‘What shall we drink?’ or ‘What shall we wear?’ For the Gentiles seek after all these things, and your heavenly Father knows that you need them all. But seek first the kingdom of God and his righteousness, and all these things will be added to you. Therefore, do not be anxious about tomorrow, for tomorrow will be anxious for itself. Sufficient for the day is its own trouble.” I think it’s important to give a quick disclaimer before we get any farther: These issues are experienced differently by many different people. Anxiety is experienced on a spectrum. Some people have simple moments of anxiety that can be pushed away by a feather of a thought. Others of us live their lives surrounded by it. Jesus’s words are for everyone here, but different people may have to use different avenues to apply them. If you don’t worry often, these words are for you — you can conquer your worry. If you have an anxiety disorder, these words are for you just as much as they are for anybody else, but it may be much harder to put these words into practice. Those of us with overactive anxiety may need to see a counselor, potentially take some medication for a little while, and try different methods to figure out exactly what it means for you to put Jesus’ words into practice here — to not be anxious. We’re studying the Sermon on the Mount, Matthew 5–7 and as Mike Fox has put it so eloquently, “The heart of the matter is that it’s the heart that matters.” Giving is about our heart when we give, not giving to look good to other people, but giving out of love. The Lord’s Prayer teaches us how to pray, It’s about our heart when we pray, not the words that we say. Fasting is about rejecting idolatry and being filled with God’s presence. Last week we learned that what we treasure will ultimately filter how we see the world. Now this week Jesus tells us to not be anxious. I may be either ridiculously unqualified to be giving this sermon today, or very qualified, because I am a supreme worry-er. I worry a lot about lots of things. I worry about doing my job well, my health, when my car will break down, paying off student loans, the massive earthquake that’s supposed to come in the next 50 years, if I’m being faithful in my walk with God, and the list continues, seemingly endlessly. I’m sure you have your worries as well. My hope is that after we’ve finished studying today’s passage together, you’ll have stronger trust in God and some tools from Jesus to combat your anxiety. Therefore I tell you, do not be anxious about your life: what you will eat or what you will drink, nor about your body, what you will put on. Jesus gives an imperative — this is not a guideline or a loose ideal concept, this is a command from God Himself. Jesus is telling us not to worry because He knows it’s what’s best for us, not to make us feel guilty for worrying. Worry is part of life. Jesus tells us that it doesn’t have to be and that He wants to help us be free of it. Charles Surgeon points out that “Worry has a fascinating etymology which can be traced back to the Old High German “wurgen” which means “to strangle” which is what worry does to our joy!” Jesus gives us three specific things to stop being anxious about: what we will eat, what we will drink, or what clothing we will put on.You may respond, “Yeah Jesus, food and clothing are important but I also have bills to pay, aging parents, rebellious kids, friends who don’t listen, a job I hate, and it’s tax season.” To reinterpret these worries for the mind of a teenager, “I have hard teachers, drama with my friends, homework I haven’t done, I have to decide where to go for college, everyone’s asking me what I want to do with my life, constant choir/band/basketball practices, and I have snapchat streaks to keep up!” Is not life more than food and the body more than clothing? Have you ever walked up to a bowl of delicious fruit only to find that it’s fake? When you go to bite into the apple, all you find is harsh reality biting back at you and Styrofoam. What gives life it’s value isn’t what we put into it or how we dress it, but its meaning — what it was created for. When we are anxious and worry about the external things like food and clothing, we lose focus on what our lives are created for. We turn ourselves into fake fruit. Jesus tells us to stop focusing so much on our internal anxiety and to look out, look up. Look at the birds of the air Jesus draws our attention away from ourselves to find an answer for our worry in the way He’s designed nature. Our lives are filled to the brim with real, significant problems — loss of people who are dear to us, life-threatening illnesses, distressing financial situations, the impending, terrifying future — anxiety feels only natural. But Jesus tells us that we don’t have to live like this, in fact, worry is not natural. Introspection is a good thing, but often when we’re worried, it can get us more stuck. Jesus says, look out, look up, over there. See the birds! Birds are wild, precious, and free — they’re graceful and calming, a perfect example of the carefree life. They neither sow nor reap nor gather into barns and yet your heavenly Father feeds them. God takes care of them always, providing the best grains, seeds, and even the occasional worm — they’re not making money and going to the store to get their food, God is guiding them to it and providing it for them. Are you not of more value then they? When God created animals, he called them good, God cares for animals and wants good things for them. But when God made us, He called us very good. He made us in His image, after His likeness to reflect His glory and partner with Him in His mission of reconciliation. We matter to God. And if He takes this kind of care of birds, won’t He take great care of us? Eugene Peterson in The Message interpret Jesus’s words like this: “Look at the birds, free and unfettered, not tied down to a job description, careless in the care of God. And you count far more to him than birds.” John Piper puts it another way, “God is so completely in control of the natural universe that he may be said to feed the birds of the air. Every berry eaten or insect snatched form the air or worm pulled from the ground is provided by God. He does that for birds. He cares more about you than the birds He does this for.” Think on this for a second. If God provides so magnificently for birds with colorful, flavorful berries, seeds, and insects, wouldn’t He provide even better for those He cares more about? Birds live carelessly in the care of God. If God’s care for us is greater, shouldn’t we have even less care then the birds? And which of you by being anxious can add a single hour to their span of life? We think that by worrying we can somehow control the outcome of our situations. Tiffany and I just got a new puppy a few weeks ago. He thinks that he knows what’s best for himself. He’s really curious about the world around him. but hes also very small, young and limited in his understanding. As I was working on this, he was wiggling around in my arms trying to jump down from my lap. All he could think about was “I want to get down, I want to get down, I want to get down.” He wasn’t aware of how badly it would hurt when he hit the ground. He jumped out of my arms and right before he hit the ground I was able to catch him. Crisis averted. I think this is actually a pretty good example of what it’s like when we worry. We want to do what we think is best: control our circumstances. But we have such a limited understanding; we have not seen the entire canvas of life, just our simple section. God is sovereign and actually painted the whole piece of art. When we try to control our situations by worrying, we can be putting ourselves in some serious danger. Grandmas worldwide have always told us, “Stop worrying or you’ll make yourself sick” and it turns out they’re actually right. Dr. Robert Ader researched and wrote for many years about the biological effects of stress. Stress triggers our fight or flight response. Prolonged existence in that state can actually do a lot of damage to our health. It can elevate our blood pressure, depress our immune system, mess with our digestion, raise our risk of diabetes, lead to depression, lower fertility, cause balding, and effect our ability to create new memories. Not only can worry damage us physically, it can also say some pretty serious things about the state of our relationship with God. “Worry is an indication that we think God cannot look after us.” Oswald Chambers writes. J. R. Rice says, “Worry is putting question marks where God has put periods.” If God says “I’ll take care of you, period.” There’s no room to add a question mark and say, “But will You really?” We can trust that He’s always been faithful, why would He stop now, with you? And why are you anxious about clothing? In our society, clothing isn’t usually a source of anxiety. Most of the time, clothing is more of an accessory to American culture. We have more than we need, and usually it’s because somewhere along the line some worker is being exploited. This word “anxious” can also mean concerned, which I think seems a bit closer to where we find ourselves in America. Why are we so concerned about clothing? Maybe we’re the lucky people who can actually have more than a few articles of clothing, but that actually may make us unlucky. We can get overly concerned about trends and fads and forget all about what’s really important in life. Don’t worry about these things, Jesus tells us, look back at nature. Consider the lilies of the field, how they grow, they neither toil nor spin Think about the beautiful flowers and the way they grow all on their own, they don’t make their own clothing (or for us, they don’t spend all their money at the mall on clothing they don’t need). Yet I tell you, even Solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one of these Even the most elegant king in all of Israel’s history wasn’t clothed as nicely as a lilly. But if God so clothes the grass of the field which today is alive and tomorrow is thrown into the oven, will he not much more clothe you, o you of little faith? What’s the purpose of a Lilly? To look at? To be fuel for an oven? How long do lilies last? If God goes to such great lengths to clothe a Lilly, won’t He provide clothing for you whom He made for His glory? Therefore, do not be anxious, saying, “What shall we eat?” or “What shall we drink?” or “What shall we wear?” For the Gentiles seek after these things This is not a slant against people who are non-Jewish, Jesus doesn’t condone any sort of bias against people one may label as different. Jesus is saying that the people who don’t know God are worried and care too much about what to eat, drink, and wear. We, the people who do know God, should live differently than the people around us who don’t know God. If you take Jesus’ words seriously here, this may mean taking a time away from the mall, asking for donations to charity for your birthday, and giving your extra things to people who need them (not just Goodwill who makes money off of your stuff). We are called to look differently than the people around us. Let’s take a careful analysis of the things we need and the things we want and ask God for the ability to know the difference. In this ability to know the difference, we’ll find many of our worries are not as important as we think they are and they’ll disappear like vapor. Your heavenly Father knows that you need them all, This is the key to not seeking after the things that make us anxious: trust that your heavenly Father knows your needs. And then change what you’re looking for in life. Seek first the Kingdom of God and His righteousness and all these things will be added to you. You won’t get everything you want, but you will get everything God knows you need. You may miss a meal here and there, but the only reason you’ll miss them is because God knows you needed to fast. You may not always have the most trendy clothes, but 5 years from now you’ll thank God for that. When I’ve been overwhelmed by anxiety in the past, something that helped the most was having a promise of God’s to ground myself in. Here’s one for you. Write it down, underline it, tattoo it on your wrist, whatever it takes to remember it: God knows my needs better than I do and He provides for them better than I can. And when you do get anxious, here’s another promise of Scripture for you to ground yourself in. Philippians 4:6–7 “Do not be anxious about anything but in everything, by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving, make your requests known to God and the peace of God which surpasses all understanding will guard your hearts and minds in Christ Jesus.” Your heart and mind will be guarded with peace when you give your anxieties to God in prayer, supplication, and thanksgiving. Therefore, do not be anxious about tomorrow, for tomorrow will be anxious for itself. The final reason Jesus tells us know to be anxious is that tomorrow will be anxious about itself. The minute that the future arrives, it becomes the present. The future isn’t real. At midnight tomorrow, tomorrow becomes today. For all eternity, we only have today. This doesn’t mean we shouldn’t plan for the non-existing future, but it means that if we waste our time worrying about it now, we’ll lose the today God has blessed us with. Sufficient for the day is its own trouble. Each day has enough trouble, doesn’t it? Why add to it? Eugene Peterson, again, interprets this text saying, “Give your entire attention to what God is doing right now, and don’t get worked up about what may or may not happen tomorrow. God will help you deal with whatever hard things come up when the time comes.” God’s mercies are new each morning. Don’t jump over them and start worrying about what’ll happen tomorrow. Walk into tomorrow through God’s mercies, knowing they’ll be there tomorrow morning waiting for you. Lamentations 3:22–23 Today has enough worries and God has tomorrow figured out. Don’t worry about your life, what you’ll drink, eat, and wear, what tomorrow might bring. God knows what you need more than you do and He will provide for your needs better than you can. “Cast all your cares on Him because He cares for you.” 1 Peter 5:7 We have so many cares, so many burdens weighing us down, Peter invites us to share these with God. What is his reason? Why can we cast our cares on Him? Because He cares for us. Because of the care that God has for us, we can give Him the things that we care about. We truly can live carelessly in the care of God because God knows what you need more than you do and can provide for your needs better than you can; so don’t be anxious.",2017
Why I Left University: shedding the leaves of denial & anxiety,"Back in October, I came face to face with a huge decision. I guess the unpleasant thing which happened was only a contributing factor, suggesting that I am a bit of a university reject anyway. I never managed to settle or feel comfortable in student life after maturing and freshers was out of my system… I would first like to point out that, I am not writing this post to seek attention and sympathy- I simply wish to create awareness to students and stress the importance of autonomy during your studies- any studies. It just so happened that this negative experience happened to push me in the right direction, however I’m aware that for others, this would have been a much worse experience, provided university is their main priority in your life. This would have been a complete nightmare. After a whole Summer of soaking within the positive rays of my coaching journey with The Coaching Academy, I was aiming high and ready for business! …However, there was that little dark cloud which would essentially slam the breaks on my coaching career development for a considerable amount of time- my final year of university. The thought of going back was like pulling on the strongest, most painful bit on a wild Mustang… But I chose to ignore this feeling and place my coaching development on hold. “I began to hyperventilate, my palms got clammy and my head started spinning with confusion- how could this be happening? how could they accuse me of this? I never cheat! I work alone! I don’t understand!” I was checking my emails before heading out to my job at Pizza Express at the time, when I got an email through my student inbox, entitled “Academic Misconduct” (well that was all I saw). It was a formal, scary, threatening, important bold lettered email informing me that I was invited to attend a meeting as I was involved in a case of “academic misconduct”. I couldn’t read the email properly as panic had struck and as I learned on one of my training days for coaching, panic= stupid. All logic went out of the window and the only words that sunk in was “cheated”, “use of another student’s work” and “discipline” and any other serious words. I began to hyperventilate, my palms got clammy and my head started spinning with confusion- how could this be happening? how could they accuse me of this? I never cheat! I work alone! I don’t understand! I was now a crumbling mess, slumped in front of my laptop in my empty home, panicking. The course I was doing was Counseling & Psychotherapy, so thankfully, I was emotionally aware of what was happening, however, controlling it was a different matter. I was operating from an internal 6 year old child, scared to leave the house without adult supervision. When I managed to compose myself, I texted one of my closest friends on the course, hoping he would respond immediately. I then emailed a tutor and forwarded the scary email to ask what this was about as I could make no logical sense of it… “I passed first time, with a first at 82% and my highest grade achieved in anything so there was no way I could be punished if someone else chose to use my work, right?…” My friend was worried that he was involved, as we had worked closely on the project, but I was confident it wasn’t his work that was involved. By now I had concluded that somebody must have copied my work and this was backed up when I got a response from the tutor confirming that someone who was resitting over the Summer had used my work and copied the ENTIRE reference list! I was infuriated! Yet at the same time, I was relieved that it seemed clear that I wasn’t the one who cheated as my grade was final- I passed first time, with a first at 82% and my highest grade achieved in anything so there was no way I could be punished if someone else chose to use my work, right?… WRONG! According to the “Academic Misconduct Panel”, I was just as guilty as the cheating, lazy rogue in question. Apparently, by sharing your work with a 3rd party, even though it is complete, graded and final, is an act of “academic misconduct” and punishable by stripping the original artist (me) of my highest grade I’ve ever achieved and awarding me a ZERO for the entire module… Just let that process for a minute. My original work was used by another student, which he disrespectfully chose to present as work of his own (i.e. PLAGIARISM) which is technically an illegal act and in the mean time, drags down myself with said plagiarist to receive the exact same disciplinary. “…these stone individuals just sat there while I ran out of the room in a state of hysterical panic, failing to provide any follow up support.” SO, I skipped the whole build up to and experience of the meeting itself there, as I wanted to get to the point quickly, but I will stress that this was one of the most unpleasant and intimidating experiences of my life which I was completely unprepared for. I am not good with being put on the spot and I felt powerless, as they towered over me with their ridiculous leading questions- I got lost in their industrial jargon. As most of us will know, especially those of my own generation, anxiety is a well known state, affecting certain people when they lack confidence in particular situations. Before the meeting, I had mentioned in the email responding to the “Academic Misconduct Panel” (AMP), that I am one of those people whom is prone to anxiety. Did they choose to take note of this- NO of course not, as these stone individuals just sat there while I ran out of the room in a state of hysterical panic, failing to provide any follow up support. This is a university in the 21st Century! “It hadn’t even registered to me at this time what this person had dragged me into.” The reason I chose to attend that meeting alone, even though I know I do have tendencies to panic in extreme situations, is because I felt so confident, knowing I was an original artist (as were the students whose work was made available to the whole year group on a university system called Blackboard for academic reference) and felt secure as the author of the original piece of work, knowing I was not, in any way guilty… Apparently, sharing with the AMP that it is common practice to share work on our course and even tutors ask us to share work with others, was not enough for them accept that perhaps we had been misguided. But hey, you know, I was a silly little girl on my own whom hadn’t taken their advice in the original email to seek support for this meeting, when I thought it would be ludicrous to even find me guilty in the first place- why would I waste time with that. I even thought this meeting was a waste of time. I guess time spent devaluing and humiliating decent students is never a waste to these people. The person whom had copied my work was at the meeting- not in the meeting, but awkwardly sat outside with me as we awaited their decisions. It hadn’t even registered to me at this time what this person had dragged me into, so the anger had not set in. All that lay there was confusion, disbelief and a slow bubbling heat of anxiety, yet to surface within me. I was fortunate that my tutors were therapists and were able to provide me with the support I needed- once I’d found my own way to them after pouring my heart out to my Dad on the phone, whose rage had transitioned to me and allowed me to wake up to this ridiculous reality of a situation. The tutors were so warm, I became more emotional and I have my personal tutor to thank for being so understanding and empowering me to seek advice with an appeal against this inhumane decision. In the heat of the moment when I fled from the room with those robotic, steel eyes upon me, all I wanted to do was leave and never come back. I wanted to shed that painful bit and gallop across the open plains and away from this brick prison of a city. For the sake of the time and effort I put into writing my masterpiece, I felt it was at least worth a try to clear my name. Even though my tutors assured me that they knew I deserved that grade.

There’s No Fear When I’m In My Room: The Reality Of Living With Agoraphobia,"*Originally written May 20, 2013* I was asked to be part of a discussion panel on personal writings and perzines at the Bradford Baked Zines event, ‘a week long celebration of self-publishing and DIY culture.’ It was a huge honour to be asked to participate and i was so siked to be up there sharing a platform with Rachel Kaye and Catriona Simons, both of whom are great writers and also strong and inspirational working class women too. We met up the night before at Cat’s house to chat through the areas we were individually going to cover, sharing our influences, previous projects and inevitably, when discussing personal writing, our own histories. I’ve known Rachel for five years now and we’re great friends, we even lived together for a few month’s early on which always adds that extra closeness and understanding of one another and their ways. It meant that at this point, sharing my personal secrets and feelings wasn’t so scary as she already knew them. What did occur to me though, as we were all sat round ready to ‘rehearse’ as it were that as much as i knew Cat and her work fairly well and we have a bunch of mutual friends, there were things we probably didn’t know about eachother at this stage and that now was the time to open up about them. Further to that, the following day i’d have to do that again to a room full of mostly strangers. The title of our discussion group was ‘It’s common but we don’t talk about it.’ This title was perfect for each of us who all found reassurance in being able to speak about our lives, struggles, feelings and experiences through personal writing. Everyone has something they find difficult to talk about or something that they have to really gauge the safety involved in doing so, eliminate any risks, worry about the consequences etc. These things lay below the surface but at times, we are almost forced to ‘come out’ as it were, be it to stop someone talking shit, to stand up and be counted, to help another or even, just to exist and be ourselves in the ways we need/have to be and feel safe and supported. For me, a lot of the ways i have to live my life are due to the fact i am diagnosed agoraphobic. We all have an appreciation for ‘the real’ and a determination to document reality and our true feelings. We all gravitate to others who share these things too in life and in our collective outputs also. This is definitely a main part of my motivations for both zines i edited. To stand up and be counted, have real voices heard and misconceptions quashed. In terms of mental health and the lack of openness to discuss it in society, this plays a huge part in our discussion. The beauty of writing about your feelings, life, loves, experiences etc for a blog or zine is that you can hide behind whatever you use to do that and there’s a barrier of safety and distance between you and the potential reader, so much so that sometimes, you even forget and end up spilling things out like you would to a hidden diary. When this barrier is removed and you’re faced with talking to people directly about these things, it’s a whole different story. One of the main areas discussed in the talk was the ability and need to have your own space to tell your truth, to speak however you want to speak and about topics of your choice. For me personally, i described the feeling of almost losing myself when setting up the business for the first few years, pulling all my strength into that project left me feeling less of my usual self, almost drained somehow. Cat is a mother of three children and added that she feels similar, especially as she has twins and the following year gave birth again, having 3 very small children to look after at once. Personal writing has been a way for the both of us to bring ourselves back, to give ourselves time to feel again and the process itself can almost act as a kind of therapy or provide moments of realisation and clarity. I’d not read any of my writing aloud or participated in a panel such as this for 3 years and through working on ‘Poor Lass’ and getting back into the process, the scene etc again, i felt able to go to the event and be a part of the discussion and it felt great. All three of us described dark places where some of our motivations for writing have come from and how through writing about these experiences we have managed to almost reclaim them as a way to use the survival as a positive and an outstretched hand to others out there looking for community, shared experience and strength in numbers. We could all remember zines we found that helped us though hard times, stories that made us feel less alone and gave us courage to continue on and battle as well as always being reminded to stay positive. The first zine i ever put out was the collective zine ‘The World’s A Mess and Yr My Only Cure,’ the name taken from the Le Tigre song ‘Eau D’Bedroom Dancing.’ It was my way of compiling lots of people’s inspirations and motivations into one place, a book of positivity, celebration, thanks and optimism. The premise was that i emailed a bunch of people to either interview or ask them to submit that i admired or took influence from and asked them to talk about their own influences and what motivated them to do what they did already and what continues to motivate them now. This was a hugely positive turning point for me and helped me understand how important and vital being surrounded by positive people, influences and also pushing yourself while also still feeling safe and reassured. It led me to really appreciate the need for self care and safe space. Something that came out of this for me, was a realisation of how much influence my being agoraphobic has had on my writing focus and content as well as being a subject that i am forced to touch upon when sharing personal experiences and stories, it’s inevitable. Prompted by a question from a person in the room regarding choosing subjects and me describing a lot of interest and stories to do with celebrities’ lives, reality shows, a life-long love of memoirs, biographies and documentaries, i realised a lot of my processing of life is done from an even safer place than i thought. I’m always hiding behind something, despite my yearning for adventure, spontaneity and passion for life, this particular difficulty i have definitely shapes the way i communicate and the level of safety i operate behind. The main thing though it to stay positive with it and recognise that the courage and strength i have to write the things i do, comes from being comfortable and feeling ok in my surroundings, safe in my own space and realising my boundaries. With this in mind, it makes me even more glad of having the ability to communicate via a blog or perzine and also an appreciation of how important DIY and zine culture has been on my life and helped me grow, exactly how i needed to, on my own terms. ‘AGORAPHOBIA IS A FEAR OF BEING IN SITUATIONS WHERE ESCAPE MIGHT BE DIFFICULT, OR HELP WOULDN’T BE AVAILABLE IF THINGS GO WRONG.’ I was diagnosed with agoraphobia in 2007 at the age of 21. When i was as young as 8 or 9, I started having symptoms of OCD and had always been an anxious person generally. i was convinced the bathroom was full of hidden cameras and had to check everything before i had a bath or shower, but it built up into a defiant refusal to wash at all, as the feeling was so strong that i knew i was being watched, even if i couldn’t find the cameras. This isn’t the sort of stuff you can talk about with your friends and have a joke about at that age. I remember trying to explain it to my mum and she just couldn’t understand it at all, it upset her and she booked me into the doctor’s as she had no idea what to do about it. At that time (mid 90’s) there was no such thing as Big Brother and similar surveillance/ fly on the wall culture that there is now, so this confession was particularly left field and pretty bizarre coming from a kid. I used to lie awake in bed waiting until everyone had gone to sleep and then sneak around and switch off all the plug sockets (resetting the video clock everytime and doing my parent’s heads in) then i sat at the end of my bed and pinned the sides of my curtains to the wall and then paper-clipped the two together in the centre to stop any light getting into my room. I started with these routines young and it was clear there was something strange about how i had to live my life, it wasn’t a choice to do this, i remember being upset about it numerous times and feeling like i couldn’t talk about it to anyone for fear of their reaction. None of it made sense in my own brain, i had no choice of anyone else understanding i thought. The anxiety and OCD continued through into my adult life but switched to new versions of itself, i could only ever sit by the window in any vehicle but if anyone sat next to me on the aisle seat on the bus or train i would start having panic symptoms and feel a massive urge that i was either about to wet myself or throw up and because that person was there i couldn’t get to the toilet in time. Being sick and wetting myself were major features of it and i never ended up doing either of those things in any situation but nonetheless the compulsions were huge and distressing, meaning i could only travel at certain times, i could never chill out or enjoy a journey and eventually they turned into me just not travelling at all, not even leaving the house. At each new stage, it seemed like more of me was disappearing. Despite the OCD symptoms when i was young, i was still wildly excited for adventure and was able to travel long distances such as a weekend run away with my friend when we were 15 to Bristol for a riot grrrl festival (incidentally where i picked up my first zine) and visiting friends i’d met online or in pen letters who loved the same things as me all across the country. It was only as i got into my twenties that the agoraphobic side of things really started taking over. I understand from my experiences as a kid and events that happened in my life that my chances of having PTSD or mental health problems are high and i’m also thankful every day that i have not found myself in more challenging situations, or gone down the statistically high route for my trauma demographic of self harming, being involved in crime or turning to drink or drugs. I try every day not to be a statistc but instead an individual with power and strength. A positive outlook and clean living keeps me within a healthy place and motivated to keep focused. ‘FOR EXAMPLE MANY AGORAPHOBICS ALSO FEAR BEING LEFT ALONE (MONOPHOBIA), DISLIKE BEING IN ANY SITUATION WHERE THEY FEEL TRAPPED (EXHIBITING CLAUSTROPHOBIA TYPE TENDENCIES) AND FEAR TRAVELLING AWAY FROM THEIR ‘SAFE’ PLACE, USUALLY THE HOME. SOME AGORAPHOBICS FIND THEY CAN TRAVEL MORE EASILY IF THEY HAVE A TRUSTED FRIEND OR FAMILY MEMBER ACCOMPANYING THEM, HOWEVER THIS CAN QUICKLY LEAD TO DEPENDENCY. THE SEVERITY OF AGORAPHOBIA VARIES ENORMOUSLY BETWEEN SUFFERERS FROM THOSE WHO ARE HOUSEBOUND, EVEN ROOM-BOUND, TO THOSE WHO CAN TRAVEL SPECIFIC DISTANCES WITHIN A DEFINED BOUNDARY. IT IS NOT A FEAR OF OPEN SPACES AS MANY PEOPLE THINK.’ In my final year of university, an intense event happened to me and when i look back and especially through the CBT and counselling sessions since, i have come to the conclusion that this must have been the trigger specifically for the agoraphobia to take hold over the other anxieties. One of the main themes of my OCD was a fear of being burgled. I locked everything up, checked doors and windows numerous times and had my dad (who’s a joiner and general handyman) come round and fit all internal doors with locks wherever i lived. One of the things you explore when in therapy for OCD is what would actually happen in these worst case scenarios you obsess about in your head. So, instead of fearing these things, what would happen if they did occur? The answers often end up with ‘you’re still alive,’ and you’d be set tasks to confront scary situations you were avoiding to see how they’re not as bad as you think etc. Except that in 2007, 3 weeks before final 3rd year deadline at uni, i was burgled. And i didn’t feel any huge relief at that, i didn’t learn any giant life changing lesson, i didn’t cure myself of the anxiety by realising that ‘whatever you do, the outcome is still the same’ like that’s supposed to do. Instead, it added a more intense fear level, a proof almost, the opposite to what the counsellors said. The scale of the burglary was massive. They crow-barred all the internal doors i’d added locks to off the hinges, got into every room and not only took anything of monetary worth (they also took the laptops our dissertations were on, the cameras with SD cards inside of all of my final year project which meant a year’s worth of work had to be fragmentedly put back together from what had been backed up, a lot was lost and it left a huge impact on our final grades) they also trashed the house, taking sentimental items and invading my privacy to the extreme, going through every drawer, through underwear, personal folders of letters and more. The worst thing was once they had finished, they left the front door wide open for anyone to walk in in the dark and when i got home around midnight, that’s the sight i saw. This is a sight now etched onto my brain, something that pops up whenever i know my house is empty and i’m on my way back, it builds up on any journey back to my house and is only lessened in intensity when i arrive to find the front door still locked and i can start to breathe properly again when i’ve checked all the doors and windows are also still locked round the back too. Since then, the default summary in my brain is, your house is not safe unless you are in it and that’s now how i live my life. ‘THEY AVOID SITUATIONS THAT CAUSE ANXIETY AND MAY ONLY LEAVE THE HOUSE WITH A FRIEND OR PARTNER, OR ORDER GROCERIES ONLINE RATHER THAN GO TO THE SUPERMARKET. THIS CHANGE IN BEHAVIOUR IS KNOWN AS AVOIDANCE’ Agoraphobia is not just as they show on TV. My impression of it before i was diagnosed was a fear of going outside, full stop. Like Matthew on Game On or Sheila on Shameless. Wild reactions to stepping out the front door and no way of functioning outside. I know now, from a lot of self reflection, living under the diagnosis for a few years and numerous counselling sessions as well as CBT, that the OCD and the agoraphobia are a secondary thing to the generalised anxiety i experience. They’re like the response my brain has to certain situations i don’t like or can’t deal with, coping mechanisms or ‘avoidance,’ a way of edging away from situations i don’t feel comfortable in. What i once knew as a main focus of my OCD behaviours, is now a major factor of the conversations i have in my brain as to why i can’t go out mixed in with an overall fear of vulnerability (something i can also trace back to childhood) and the need to be able to control or be assured of the outcome of certain scenarios and situations. The misconception is that this is a choice and therefore, sufferers are happy with the decision to avoid leaving the house. For me, as a person who is excited about life, keen to experience everything and make the most of living, it’s particularly difficult. It’s very hard to understand yourself, nevermind for others and as it’s more to do with reassurance and control, rather than simply stepping outside of your front door, people can’t get their heads around why you can sometimes go out and not others. This is possibly one of the worst things about agoraphobia for me, you worry about your friends and family thinking you’re avoiding them, ditching them, or that you don’t wanna see them or spend time with them. This isn’t the case at all. Part of the illness, often diagnosed alongside OCD, are the compulsive thoughts and beating yourself up about wanting to do things but not being able, letting yourself down as well as others and a spiral of frustratedness when it’s at it’s worst. It’s not like ‘oh i don’t think i can do that today’ and giving up easily, it’s more like looking forward to something but knowing it’s going to be hard and battling with your own thoughts that are trying to convince you that there are a million reasons why it would be a bad idea. Even when i’m at a good point and feeling healthier, my head will be full of obsessive thoughts as to what outcomes could happen at every step of a journey and why i shouldn’t go. ‘IN PARTICULAR STRESS MANAGEMENT TECHNIQUES AND VARIOUS KINDS OF MEDITATION PRACTICES AS WELL AS VISUALIZATION TECHNIQUES CAN HELP PEOPLE WITH ANXIETY DISORDERS CALM THEMSELVES AND MAY ENHANCE THE EFFECTS OF THERAPY. SO CAN SERVICE TO OTHERS WHICH CAN DISTRACT FROM THE SELF-ABSORPTION THAT TENDS TO GO WITH ANXIETY PROBLEMS. THERE IS ALSO PRELIMINARY EVIDENCE THAT AEROBIC EXERCISE MAY HAVE A CALMING EFFECT. SINCE CAFFEINE, CERTAIN ILLICIT DRUGS, AND EVEN SOME OVER-THE-COUNTER COLD MEDICATIONS CAN AGGRAVATE THE SYMPTOMS OF ANXIETY DISORDERS, THEY SHOULD BE AVOIDED’ The reason i finally decided to write something specifically about this rather than my usual bits of including anecdotes across some of my writing is that this weekend really highlighted some more elements to me and i think it’s so very important for more people to discuss the realities of mental health and particularly in a positive light. This may not sound too positive as i’m discussing the condition itself specifically rather than in relation to how it is in my everyday but what i’d like to put out there is that it is possible to live the life you want to live. It’s not the end of the world and you shouldn’t give up. As i’ve learned to do since i was young, you have to find a balance, find your safe places and learn to live with your boundaries as best you can but see them as a safe and comfortable base to work on pushing yourself from. I make sure i don’t feel too restricted or upset about situations by always having certain positive or happy things around me. I am aware of what makes me feel more connected to the world, what can get me in a precious and happy place and good sources of inspiration and calm to surround myself with. It makes a huge difference if the people around you understand how your brain works and they can help situations without you even having to ask or for anyone to feel dependent or depended upon. Through reading about this, i’ve seen a lot of people with agoraphobia also have issue with vulnerability and this often falls into that category. You don’t have to feel like that, you should always reach out. Whether it’s through a zine or a blog or even through social networking, if that’s what works for you, don’t feel bad about it. Find what works for you and learn to work together with your own brain instead of seeing it as the enemy or something you have to just deal with. It’s a lot to do with keeping positive and being healthy, living a calm life free of needless anxiety and you really start noticing a difference and an ease. The gym is a big part of settling my brain and focusing on something other than the obsessive reasons not to do something. I run my own business from behind a computer screen and don’t have to leave the house to do it, this has helped in so many ways to calm me down and this is reflected in certain areas of improvement for me. You have to work with what you have, instead of running scared or giving up, for me accepting it’s existence and that it probably is always gonna be in the back of my head, even at my healthiest was actually a positive thing. It means i have learned to live with it and just adjust my life and the way i do things to run alongside it. There’s always gonna be things i find difficult but it makes a huge difference once you’re aware of your limits, open about things to the people around you and you have a good programme of self care and relaxation. I built the zine fest up in my head for a week, gave myself the time to consider all the pro’s as well as the cons and then focused on once it’s over, giving myself time, downloading inspiring films, reading books i’ve been wanting to read and often what happens with me is buying a cake or ordering a pizza haha, it sounds a bit like bribing a child to do something but if it works, it works and my life has changed drastically since i spent time being open with myself and others about this. Standing up and being counted is another great way of helping others and increasing visibility and decreasing stigma. My favourite example of a fellow agoraphobe is Woody Allen, he’s a huge fan of New York City and being a part his surroundings, interacting with others and human connection and is a person who loves art and feeling, he pushes himself and is so much richer for it. He’s a celebrated appreciator of many social aspects of life and also of environment, a real success for an agoraphobe!",2017
The great Aldi Adventure of 2017,"with the idea of German grocery stores ever since Edeka’s Supergeil commercial made it’s debut. (You’re welcome for that link, by the way.) Not only are German supermarkets home to Ritter Sport Butter Biscuits, they apparently also have suave old dudes, frolicking about, singing and dancing to industrial music in their aisles. Could it get any better? I’ve since learned that Aldi is owned by a German company and I’ve wanted to go ever since because, well… frolicking dudes and German cookies. Also it’s supposed to be hella-cheap and full of organic and non-GMO food and that’s important too, I guess. There’s an Aldi down the street from me and every time I drive by — which has been approximately eleventy-billion times in the past three years — I think to myself, “I should really go shop there sometime.” Yeah, you read that right. I’ve been thinking about going for three years. Clearly grocery shopping isn’t high on my priority list. Anyhoooo… after overhearing my friend Brandi talk about a trip to Aldi a few weeks ago, I decided to finally give it a go. Except I have this whole weird social anxiety thing that’s been acting up recently as these things tend to do in times of high stress (and trust me, starting a new business is definitely a time of high stress). In the past year I’ve managed to earn a Master’s degree, quit a job of 16 years, launch two businesses and travel to two foreign countries, but not knowing what awaits me on the other side of Aldi’s electronic doors (groceries?) is legit, straight up giving me anxiety. True story. “I’m having far more anxiety over shopping at a new store than one should, but here we are. So… which Aldi do you go to? Is it cool? Are they nice? Do I have to bring my own bags? Will they laugh at me once I step inside? And what about the frolicking dudes? Like, are they real?” Brandi was super-cool and talked me off the ledge by answering all my questions without judgement. I decided I had enough information to finally face this silly fear and, as we talked, I steered the car towards Aldi. Just as I was pulling up to the corner to turn into the parking lot Brandi added, “Oh, and you’ll need a quarter for the shopping cart.” My gentle snowflakes, I have never been so relieved to be sans one shiny quarter in my life. I drove my ass right past Aldi and straight to my local Kroger. Dodged that bullet. More so, I couldn’t get the “anxiety thing” out of my head. For years I lived with anxiety and limited my life because of an overwhelming fear of the unknown. That was the old me, however. For the better part of the last decade I have reveled in a new life — one free of social anxiety and depression. I’ve been going a little backwards lately and it breaks my heart. I don’t want to be that former version of myself again. So, I’ve been gathering quarters in my coat pocket for a week now, preparing to face this (admittedly, laughable) fear. Sunday night another friend, Susan, who knows about my “Aldi anxiety” sent me a “What you should know about shopping at Aldi” video. I thank the universe for my Hive who supports me in facing even the most laughable of fears. Monday morning I decided I had wasted enough time and energy on something that, in the scheme of things, really didn’t matter all that much. And I had to ask someone to show me how to unleash the carts with my shiny quarter. And the cashier smirked at me when I tried to bag my groceries at the conveyor belt (there’s a shelf at the front of the store you go to after you check out). And I didn’t buy enough bags the first time through to carry all my groceries, so I had to go back through the line a second time. And a very aggressive (or near-sighted — or both) woman damn near took me out trying to get to the frozen organic mango chunks. I’m pretty sure EVERYONE knew it was my first time at Aldi. *gasp* But just like every fear that has ever been placed in my path, I survived it. In fact, I’m kind of like an old-school Aldi pro now. The “Aldi anxiety” was really just a displaced fear of some other stuff going on in life right now — stuff like quitting a job and leaving behind everything that has ever been familiar. Every day I’m stepping into strange new places and having to rely on the direction of complete strangers to survive. It’s unsettling to say the least. But, just like Aldi, I’ll survive this unknown territory too. II’ll do it because I have a pocketful of tools (quarters and otherwise) to lean on — tools that many wonderful women helped me to develop. I’ll do it because I have a Brandi and a Susan that will show me love without judgement. And I’ll do it because I believe that I don’t have to define myself by who I used to be. I went back there for a time, but I didn’t stay too long. Change works like that, after all — back and forth, zigs and zags. It’s not a linear process as much as we would like it to be. So, what’s the “silliest” fear you ever faced down?",2017
Giving worry a specific time,"Often we try to think ourselves free from worry, thinking the very process is constructive when essentially it acts to lower our mood and once we have started we find it hard to control. A popular recommendation from Cognitive Behavioural Therapists is the idea of a ‘worry period’ used to try and confine worrisome thoughts to a specific period. Acknowledging thoughts are there but using a sense of being present and mindful to let them go with the idea of addressing them at a later time. The idea is to help you feel more in control of your distressing thoughts rather then letting them control you, breaking the habit of dwelling on worries, and wasting countless hours.",2017

Overcoming Depression Part 8,"Somehow, in junior high school and high school, I had three episodes of anxiety/panic attacks that lasted non-stop, for 2 to 3 months each…they all started in the fall, and, they all disappeared. In college, alcohol seemed to be the short term solution to these, as they never appeared. However, shortly after college was over, they returned, and they became more severe than ever before….",2017
Is There a Way to Deal With Stress Without Confronting Its Source?,"At least, that’s what most of us believe. But there must be some sort of happy medium, right? Something that would allow us to alleviate the short-term pain while still doing nothing about the long-term game. Or at least buying us some time before we need to stare down the very thing that’s making us miserable — and weakening our immune systems, giving us ulcers and stealing our memories from us. You know, punting. Yet while it might seem like a cop out, it’s not as impossible (or unhealthy) as it seems. And it might just be the best thing for you. “When you’re so stressed that you can’t think with clarity, you need to do some other relaxation techniques first,” says Mary Alvord, director of a group mental-health practicein Maryland. It’s sensible enough advice: Stress floods your system with adrenaline, which increases both your heart and breathing rate to ship more oxygen to your tensed up muscles. This clenched state — especially the spike in blood pressure — not only causes damage to your body over the long-term, it seriously clouds your judgment. So before you even consider confronting the source of your stress, it’s a good idea to find a way to dial down the symptoms. Which techniques will be most effective depends on the source of your stress, Alvord explains. For chronic stress emanating from uncertainty about the future, or from dwelling on past events in your life (e.g., divorce or death), she suggests training yourself in the psychology cure-all du jour: Mindfulness. “It’s not making you forget,” she says, “but it teaches you to be in the moment and not to get stuck on the past or worry unduly about the future.” For acute stress (that is, isolated moments of intense stress), she teaches visualization techniques: “This is so you can be at work, in a stressful situation, and imagine yourself by the ocean, if that’s something that’s relaxing for you. Go there for a few minutes, calm yourself down and then you can get back on task.” At the root of many people’s struggles with stress is a missing sense of control in their lives. It’s no coincidence that being choked by debts and bills, or even just having a career that seemingly offers no room for meaningful advancement, are so often cited among the leading causes of stress in America. But if our stress is really coming from a feeling that we’re not in charge of our own lives, what’s the answer? How do you control what you can’t control? For some psychologists, cognitive behavior therapy programs — in which patients are encouraged to learn practical problem-solving techniques to break out of damaging patterns of behavior — are the best answer. “It’s learning to be proactive and coming up with plans to take initiative, so that you feel like you’re doing something,” she explains. If your stress is work-related, it could take the form of on-the-job training or mentoring, or getting as far from work as possible and doing the things that make you happy. “If you can believe that you have some power to control some aspects of your life — not everything, but some aspects — and take charge of those, you tend to be more resilient in more areas,” she says. Similarly, according to a 2015 Penn State study, it’s not so much the type of stress you’re under that determines how much your health is going to be affected, but how you react to it. Participants with generally sunnier dispositions, they found, were able to cope with stress markedly better than pessimists. As one of the world’s leading authorities on stress, Robert Sapolsky, wrote in his 1994 book Why Zebras Don’t Get Ulcers, “Those who cope with stress successfully … do not try to control future events that are uncontrollable and do not try to fix things that are not broken or that are broken beyond repair.” All in all, the question we started with — is there any true cure for stress besides tackling whatever is stressing you out? — turns out to be a misleading one, since even that may not be the correct course of action. Experts agree, of course, that removing all sources of stress from your life is effective, but without proper planning and forethought, that can also backfire spectacularly: Sure, your job is a nightmare, but it’s probably not as much of a nightmare as suddenly being unable to pay your bills. Stress is complicated, and it requires a complicated response. It demands that you find a way to override the physical and mental effects of stress long enough to come up with a workable plan for removing the source entirely. It’s life-planning while already hopelessly overloaded, which is such a dauntingly grim task that it’s no wonder people often need a therapist or counsellor to help them figure it out. This is especially true if the source of your stress seems more intangible than a bad job or relationship which, although extremely difficult, you do actually have a degree of control over — i.e., you can leave the job or relationship. When it comes down to it, as unscientific and hammy as it sounds, having an upbeat outlook on life could be the best defense of all, although you don’t necessarily have to go the full Ned Flanders. “Your glass that’s half full can still have a bunch of bad stuff at the bottom,” says Alvord. “But the trick is to see those positives as more dominant.” melmagazine.com melmagazine.com melmagazine.com",2017
The ‘Debbie Downer’ Effect,"When you’re in a bad mood, everything looks bleak, including your relationships. When your relationships aren’t going well, you’re also more likely to feel sad and perhaps a little anxious. Clearly, the relationship between your emotions and your relationships is a strong one. You can take steps to improve things in your relationships, and this can help you feel better. However, if your mood is chronically depressed, this can greatly complicate the process. Without knowing it, you’re causing others to stay away from you or to regard you with a less than enthusiastic welcome when you walk into the room. Similarly, in your closest relationships, a tendency to see the dark side of a situation can permeate your interactions with those who love you. According to University of Waterloo psychologist Uzma Rehman and colleagues (2015), people who have major depressive disorder (the clinical form of depression) have higher levels of distress in relationships, feel that their marriages are less satisfactory, and become unusually upset when problems develop in their relationships. They are more likely to blame their partners when things go wrong, and they tend to shut down emotionally instead of reach out and connect. Their partners, in turn, feel more emotionally burdened and distressed themselves. As Rehman et al. note (p. 716): “individuals with depression or those exhibiting depressogenic vulnerabilities may behave in ways that increases interpersonal stress.” It’s those depressogenic vulnerabilities that seem to be at the heart of the problem. If you’re have those tendencies, you see situations in the most negative light possible and carry those perceptions into your interactions with others- the “Debbie Downer” effect, we might say ( Debbie Downer is a name of a fictional Saturday Night Live character who debuted in 2004, and who was portrayed by Rachel Dratch and now a slang phrase which refers to someone who frequently adds bad news and negative feelings to a gathering, thus bringing down the mood of everyone around them.) Just as depression and relationship satisfaction are linked, so is anxiety and distress in the relationship. Being in a poorly functioning relationship may make you more susceptible to the experience of anxiety which, in turn, can lead relationship quality to worsen. If your partner is a happy person and the Debbie Downer effect takes place courtesy of the other partner, that relationship may be heading for the pit. There is what is called the anxious attachment style in predicting relationship outcomes. Men who experience anxiety may seem to be more rejecting to their wives and because wives are typically more sensitive to rejection, this in turn can cause them to question and doubt their marriage’s quality. Depression remains an important predictor of relationship quality, even if only at one point in time. Rehman and her fellow researchers believe there may be a shared vulnerability between depression and anxiety, and that in reality, they are difficult to distinguish. When you or your partner are stressed and unhappy, ordinary life becomes more of a struggle. You’ll fail to see what’s good about your relationship and as a result, either shut down (which appeared to be the case for men) or blame yourself for everything that’s going wrong (the women’s response). Look deep within and search for where anxiety plays a role in your relationship. So with this knowledge that you have, check your relationship with your spouse or close friend and examine to see who plays the Debbie Downer’s role. Prepare to make a change or help make the change.

Anxiety and Intimacy,"In my mind, I played it so cool. I was friendly, but not too flirty. I was respectful and reserved. I was trying to take the focus off the fact that the moment we locked eyes, there was a deep sense of knowing; of wanting. I was quick to dissuade and dampen it. I was so fucking coy about it too. While our friends all congregated in the summer heat outside, he stood in the other room, curiously alone. “What are you doing?” I asked, innocuous and inebriated. “Waiting for you.” “Why’s that?” I continued in my coyness. And it was at this point, he cupped my face in his hands. He leaned in, and the fireworks that transpired burned brighter than any sun. It was the sweetest surrender, the tension snapping like an over-tuned guitar string. He pulls back, and with fire blazing through his gaze says, “You have no idea how gorgeous you are. You really don’t.” He looked at me with this drunken intensity and I looked back. Any girl would be thrilled to feel this hot spotlight of attention. My ego should have been the size of a burning man bonfire. But his words gave rise to such ambivalence. I couldn’t tell if it was a compliment or an astute observation. His words fragment me. I felt like I was caught in a lie, the lie I was telling myself. I was so ready to compartmentalize. To enjoy the moment. To not read too far into anything. To take it at face value. To not acknowledge how in my heart of hearts, this is not what I want. All my hard work to maintain composure. To be alluring and captivating, yet seem delightfully bored. All to be dashed away in a single breath. Anxiety decided to come out to play, seizing what was supposed to be my goddamn moment. I was unable to make lasting eye contact. This sinking feeling of discomfort had overcome me. It became too real, and yet so vapid and hollow all at once. The ruiner. The self sabotager. I am my own worst enemy. I gave what I thought to be a shy smile. I blinked back tears. I must be a good actress, since we carried on through the night. When I lay there, I felt his heat move through me, his eyes locking with mine again. I wanted so badly to connect, to feel the love we were making. And yet I felt distracted and disheartened. Deep in my soul, I want a true intimacy. One that is soothing, all encompassing. One that cannot be made between sheets alone. One that I may not even be ready for. And it was so very obvious in that moment. “You have no idea how gorgeous you are.” Maybe you’re right. But I don’t think that’s for you to decide.

Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD),"Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is a relatively common mental health problem that occurs in up to 3% of people. It generally begins during adolescence or early adulthood, but it can occur at any age, including in childhood. As the name suggests, the condition consists of recurrent obsessions and compulsions, although not all people suffer both components. Obsessions are unwanted and intrusive thoughts or urge and can include things such as repetitive worries about dirt or germs, or fears of embarrassing yourself in public. Compulsions are acts or rituals that the sufferer feels compelled to perform, usually in response to their obsessions. Sometimes these are visible and obvious like constant hand washing or turning light switches on or off a specific number of times, but sometimes these rituals are invisible to other people such as mentally repeating a phrase over and over again. The hallmark of these obsessions and compulsions is that they are ‘egodystonic’ which means that they are distressing and unpleasant to the sufferer who never-the-less finds it tough to resist them. Typically the obsession causes anxiety which is not relieved until the compulsion is enacted. The compulsion itself doesn’t bring about any pleasure but performing it helps to ease the anxiety. A mild example of this feeling that most people will be able to relate to is the sudden thought that you might have left the house unlocked. You may not be able to rest easy until you have gone back home to check the door. If you are just outside your house, you will probably just pop back and check, but if you are far away, you will probably be able to put the worry to the back of your mind until you get home. For someone suffering from OCD, the obsession (‘the door is unlocked’) may provoke severe anxiety, and the compulsion (i.e. checking the door) may be very much more elaborate and time-consuming than simply testing the handle. An OCD sufferer is also not able to quickly put the worry to the back of their mind and will simply have to ‘check the door’ however inconvenient or difficult that may be. If an OCD sufferer tries to resist their obsessions and compulsions or is prevented from enacting the compulsion for some reason, they may experience a great deal of distress and anxiety. The causes of OCD are complex and not fully understood, but there are clearly some genetic factors because identical twins are more likely to both suffer from OCD than non-identical twins. Environmental factors such as having suffered abuse or neglect also seem to play a role, and some people have personality traits that predispose them to OCD. Sometimes OCD is triggered by periods of stress, and sometimes it exists alongside another mental health condition such as depression or schizophrenia. The condition can range from a mild inconvenience to being utterly disabling, preventing the sufferer from living anything like a normal life and sometimes even putting their health at risk. Those with mild symptoms often respond well to treatment with psychological therapies such as Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT). CBT works by attempting to address ‘cognition’ by introducing new or different ways of thinking, and these changes in thought processes then cause a change in behaviour. It is very effective for treating OCD. People with moderate symptoms are normally treated with CBT and an antidepressant type medication (which also work well for anxiety symptoms), and those with severe symptoms need intense psychological therapy and medication. Without treatment OCD symptoms may not settle and may get worse but, with treatment, many people’s symptoms lessen significantly or entirely disappear.",2017
Writing My Way Out of This One,"I don’t want to do it but I am going to do it anyways. I would rather do anything else. I would rather sit in my garden and watch bugs and birds fly. I would rather take a walk, read a book, go spend money, listen to music- anything but this. This is hard. It is not what I want to do but I am going to force myself to do it anyways. “Write it out man. Just write it out……” I know this is what some of my literary heroes would tell me. Ok. I’m going to write. Let’s see what happens. I have been dwelling a lot in my mind. Like a person lost in a dark cave I have been wondering around a lot in this cave of my own mind. My mind is rarely a pleasant place to be. When in the cave it is filled with thoughts about potential falling rocks, deep holes in the ground, threats behind every corner and of course being lost in the cave forever. Some people may be able to walk through the cave of their own minds and have a rather pleasant experience. Not I. For me it is a continual stream of worry and fear about what terrible or harmful thing could happen next. This is not helping. I really don’t want to be thinking about any of this. I want to just go do something that will help me to forget and maybe even feel immediately better. Pop a pill? I don’t want to do that. Have a glass of wine? Too early. Overeating at lunchtime did not work. Now my stomach just feels upset and my upset stomach is only making my anxiety worse. I know that making my suffering an object of my awareness can help. Take a step back from myself and observe it in the same way that I would observe a protagonist in a book or an actor on a screen. This could help. This is why I am writing. Carl Jung often said that a way of reducing suffering is to find the meaning in a difficult event. Ok, that is what I am doing here. The way we make meaning out of our suffering is by taking a step back from it, becoming aware of it and turning it into some story we are reading, writing or watching rather than being all caught up in it. That is what I am trying to do now. My stomach feels unwell. I hear sounds of birds. Sirens (I don’t like the sounds of sirens but always feel grateful that they are not coming for me). The sun is starting to come out. I have been dwelling in negative thoughts about the end of life. Sudden loss of control just around the corner. This is what all anxiety really is right? The fear of death and/or complete loss of control just up ahead. Isn’t this why we really preoccupy ourselves with work, drama and other things? Isn’t this why we drink booze and use other substances? To forget about death. But sometimes this is where my mind goes and it is difficult to stop it. I am beginning to feel a bit better. I am going to keep writing this. I am going to keep trying to pull myself out of my head. I am starting to see a sliver of light up ahead. Phew. I thought his one was going to be bad. There it is up ahead. Light. Ok, keep carrying on. Keep writing. Maybe the more I can step back from the thoughts in my head, the more I can begin to feel better. This is what I am trying to do by writing. It can also be done through meditation or anything else a person can focus on outside of their own head. I am working hard here. I am really trying to stay with this. All I want to do is get up and go do something else. Go sit in the garden. Go sit on my couch. Go do something else. But I know that if I go do these things I will only get pulled further into the negative machinations of my own mind. I will write. “As long as you unconsciously identify with the sufferer and remain unaware of the pain creator, you are stuck in a anxious state.” This is what Arnold Mindell wrote in Working On Yourself Alone. I am writing so that I can keep myself from becoming unaware that I am the one creating this anxious state. The moment I forget this and get sucked back into the dark cave of my mind, I will be suffering. So I need to keep trying to pull myself out. The pain creator is the one who is identifying with all the negative thoughts in my head. By writing (and mediating) I am stepping back from the sufferer. I am becoming aware of the sufferer in an objective way. Just making a story out of the suffering. That is what I am doing by writing here. Just making a story out of it. Turning my suffering into a story. Ok. Is it working yet? A bit. This kind of thing doesn’t happen on my time. It takes its own kind of time. I just need to be able to breathe, write remain as aware (present) as possible and be patient. I will now go into my garden for a bit and just breathe. Just take a step back from the sufferer for a bit. Be back in a few minutes. Without a doubt, getting stuck in one’s own head, is a real illness. When we feel anxious or worried it is difficult to keep it from happening. People who do not deal with so much worry or anxiety do not have to really worry about being lost in their head. Wondering through the cave of their minds can often be a very pleasant and sometimes magical experience. But for those of us with a predisposition to worry and feel intense fear, getting lost in our heads (unconsciously identifying with the sufferer) is the worst possible thing we can do for ourselves. We need to get better at not doing this if we want our anxiety to go away. I am feeling better now. My wife made me a cup of chamomile tea. Talking with her about what I was feeling helped. Writing this also seems to have really helped me become aware of and take a step back from my suffering. The sun is coming out. I am doing better now. Everything is fine right here, right now. It is interesting how anxiety can be like waves. It comes on strong and threatens to suck us under. Years ago when it came on strong like it did when I began writing this, I would have freaked out. I would have panicked. I would have reacted negatively. But by just doing whatever it takes to stay present and as out of my head as possible, whether it is banging my fingers on a keyboard until the intense feeling of anxiety begins to diminish or by talking with someone, drawing, painting, meditating, cleaning the house, reading out loud, deep breathing and on and on, I am able to hang in there until the terror and fear pass. ……..and now I am beginning to feel normal again. Writing my way out worked. I think I am almost out of the cave. Phew.",2017
“Life Will Get Better” — Part 1,"This is a summary of the book “Life Will Get Better: Simple Solutions for Parents of Children with Attention, Anxiety, Mood, and Behavioral Challenges” by Nicole Beurkens, Ph.D. These are her ideas, and I’m simply picking what I think to be the high points of each chapter to make it a quicker read for parents that would find this information useful, but have busy schedules and can’t find the time to read the book in its entirety. Chapter 1: Life Will Get Better There’s never a wrong time to start implementing something into your child’s life that will move him or her forward. You may think they are too young or too old, but that’s most likely not the case. Children can be a fun challenge. They are unpredictable; you may feel like you’re walking on eggshells around them, and wondering how to better communicate with them. As parents, you see the many gifts your child has to offer the world, but they have these challenges that are holding them back from reaching their fullest potential. You’re not completely sure what they need and how to best help them. This is what the book’s all about. Maybe your child’s challenge is large enough that you fear about his or her future and wonder what will happen if their condition or symptoms never improve. Or, on the other hand, maybe what your child is challenged with is relatively minor. No matter how big or small of problem your child is going through, children can always learn, grow, and improve from where they are. This book covers how to optimize your child’s health, development, and function through 5 key areas: Nutrition, Sleep, Movement, Connection, and Cognition. The book will give real life stories and situations regarding the five areas. This book is specifically for kids struggling with attention, anxiety, mood, and behavior challenges. But honestly, this is awesome information that should be studied and implemented for every child. Sometimes, kids receive a formal diagnosis, but you aren’t presented with great ways to treat or help the problem. Following the guidance in the following chapters may be a great starting point. Symptoms rarely occur because of a single factor. That’s why in this book there are five key areas to address when trying to make a change. That is a crucial thing to remember when considering anyone’s health concerns. When you ask, “what’s causing condition X?” Sometimes, that is a very hard question to answer because most of the time, it is multifactorial. Although it is important to remember many health challenges are multifactorial, please, don’t get overwhelmed. Don’t try to change every single thing your child does overnight. Take one small step at a time. One of Dr. Nicole’s last lines of the chapter was “It is important for you to understand that you are not to blame for your child’s difficulties and challenges.” This is entirely accurate, and you should always remember this. Whether their challenge is big or small, formally diagnosed or not, they are still “children” and should be called and respected as such and not by their diagnosis or challenge. Part 1 only consists of one chapter. Tomorrow, we will begin to get into the meat and potatoes of the book. Tomorrow: Part 2: Nutrition — Chapters 2–7",2017
It’s now or never.,"Even as I write this, I’m trying my best to be in the present moment. For as long as I can remember, I’ve almost always been drawn towards the past or the future. It has come to a point where I have had to consciously make an effort to remind myself of being in the present moment. I call it anxiety and I’d like to believe the world calls it the same. I have a strong feeling that many people feel and experience it too. After so many years, it is exhausting and I want these occasional unrest inside me to end. The question isn’t how. Starting from Google to a stranger friend on social and from a co-worker to a random mag article can help with how-to. The real question is why. I want this anxiety attacks or experiences to end for me as for many out there because: Whether you experience the same or not, I ask you to step out for a few moments, appreciate the present and fully live it. Just look at the plants or a pet (if you have one), the sky or best, yourself in a mirror. I’m stepping out for some sunshine. Have a wonderful now!",2017
Common Breathing Techniques for Anxiety Reduction,"Breathe in, now breathe out. Was it a long, deep breath? Or a quick, shallow one? The way we breathe can affect how we feel and vice versa. Learning proper breathing techniques and exercises, therefore, can directly interact with feelings of stress and anxiety. Here are a few worth trying. Calm breathing might sound generic, but for individuals living with anxiety it can actually take a significant amount of mindfulness. Put simply, “calm breathing” helps you to slow down your breathing when you’re stressed or anxious. It involves: Trying this exercise throughout your day, for about a total of five minutes per day, is a great practice to help reduce feelings of anxiety. As you begin to get more comfortable with it, you will find that you can use this technique in situations that tend to cause you anxiety. Very similar to calm breathing is “coherent breathing.” This involves also controlling the lengths of breaths to breathe approximately five times every minute. This rate is in the middle of what is known as the average “resonant breathing rate” which is indicative of a person’s calm mental state. This breathing technique might be familiar to those who meditate or practice yoga, but for anyone living with anxiety it’s a great way to manage symptoms as it is said to bring feelings of calm and balance. To try alternating nostril breathing out, find a comfortable seated position. Next, hold your right thumb over your right nostril and breathe in deeply through the left nostril. At the end of your inhale, switch fingers and close off the left nostril and exhale through the right. It is believed that this breathing technique not only brings balance, but energy and rejuvenation so avoid trying it right before going to bed. While these breathing techniques are excellent ways to help you to cope when anxiety symptoms arise, they aren’t the solution to this mental health condition. Instead, it’s important to speak to a mental health professional about other healthy strategies that you can implement in your daily life.

We All Just Want to be Healed,"We all just want to be healed. Regardless of what type of traumas we survived as children or adults, or which illnesses we have been diagnosed with, the end goal is the same. We want the pain and the burden of guilt and shame that we have carried for a lifetime to be eased. We yearn to somehow lessen the effects of our traumas that we drag along like a ball and chain, be it with medications, therapy or a combination of both. We’re looking for our piece of happiness and a sense of peace, but it seems that at some point in time, we all hit our “breaking” point and perhaps that is what starts us on our journey down the seemingly elusive path of healing. The road to healing is unpaved, unstable and full of unseen hills and curves, yet we trod along, often taking one step forward and falling three steps back. We may see some progress and then suddenly become overwhelmed with emotions which send us spiraling down into the darkness of depression, yet somehow with the lure of being healed, we eventually manage to claw our way back up to continue our fight. This cycle of ups and downs may slow down our progress but as long as we advance in a forward motion, we will get there eventually…or at least that is what my therapist tells me.As much as healing is the ultimate goal, I struggle with two major issues down my path, the first being, what exactly is healed? The concept is not only completely foreign to my mind but also seems completely unattainable. I can imagine it would be like the weight of the world being lifted off your shoulders, or like being able to have days where your mind does not perpetually attack you and send you into a state of emotional frenzy for minutes, hours or even days. I picture fewer tears, less ups and downs and less fear. I imagine rising in the morning and not having those instant few moments of wishing I hadn’t awoken. I picture a more emotionally stable life with healthier relationships and positive choices. Is that being healed or a fantasy I have created of what I wish things could be like? What is often forgotten on the path of healing is that in order to get there, I have to give up my two best friends, in my case, depression and anxiety, both of which have lasted longer than any one person or thing in my life. Even though I despise the depths of the darkness I am pulled into, there is a sense of comfort there simply because of familiarity. I have been wading in those waters for so long I no longer know the feeling of walking on dry land. I would have to walk away from the safety of my passive suicidal thoughts, the one thing I can control. I may not be my illnesses per say, but they have certainly been with me long enough to become a small part of my identity, regardless of the obvious negative aspect, and I am supposed to just lose pieces of me and trade them in for the unknown? The same applies to my negative coping mechanisms. I have been in weekly trauma based therapy for over a year and have been taught many new, positive ways to handle different situations. I have learned different techniques to recognize where my emotions are coming from, that perhaps they are a trauma response from the past. I have been shown how to try to regulate the impulsivity associated with BPD. I have listened, learned, read books and done worksheets and yes, have even taken a few steps forward. However, learning and putting into practice are two different things. When I am of rational mind I am calm enough to remember these methods and perhaps even put them to practice, but when I am emotively driven, the new habits are kicked out the door by the old ones which have become instinctual. They may not be the healthiest ways to cope but for me, they are tried, tested and proven. They have helped to get me through the hardest of times from the earliest of ages. They have kept me safe and alive until this very day, and again I am expected to surrender them and replace them with methods that in my mind are yet untested and unproven. The path to healing involves a whole lot of uncertainty and blind trust. It means being willing to lose those parts of you that have provided safety and comfort for all those years. It requires an open mind, an open heart and the aspiration to learn. Don’t get frustrated with not making instant or even quick progress, as it takes hours and hours of practice to replace a negative coping mechanism with a healthy one, which will take patience and dedication. All of these twists and turns on my path of healing have tested every emotion and reaction possible, they have pushed me back as I am struggling to step forward, yet I continue on. I am not yet at the point of replacing all of the old with new and have found that as long as I have the comfort and availability of the old tucked in the back of my head, then the new seems a little less frightening. It’s like wading into the deep waters but knowing there is a lifeboat within reach.",2017
8 Ways to Calm Anxiety Before Visiting the Dentist,"I don’t know about you but having my dentist poke around in my mouth isn’t my definition of fun. Sound familiar? Well, we’re not alone. Nearly half percent of Americans have dental anxiety. In fact, 5–10 percent of these Americans are so afraid of the dentist that they avoid going even when treatment is necessary. Image Credit: Pixabay Is the anxiety over visiting the dentist so intense that you find yourself losing sleep? If so, you may be suffering from dental anxiety. But not to worry. This anxiety, like all others, can be managed and even eliminated. The key to overcoming dental anxiety is to prepare for the visit before you even make the appointment. This will empower you and help ease your fears. You may not feel comfortable talking to your dentist about your fears. But remember this. Your dentist works for you. Yep, from the moment you walk through those doors and settle down into that chair, and you’re the boss. Tell your dentist how you feel. Come on. Just come right out with it. But if your talk doesn’t make you feel safer and more secure, get another dentist. After all, that person will be poking around in your mouth. Remember that providing comfort and peace of mind should be your dentist’s primary concern. 2. Use Bit of Sign Language Found a dentist you like and trust? Good. Now it’s time to work on your language skills. It may be tad difficult to speak to your dentist when your mouth is full of dental tools. But it’s crucial to be able to communicate if you’re experiencing pain, discomfort or need a break during the procedure. Before visiting my dentist I made sure to work out, ahead of time, signals for: stop, when I needed suction, water, a break, etc. My dental anxiety fizzled because I felt a lot safer knowing I had an easy way to communicate with her no matter what. 3. Find a Distraction Does your dentist offer distractions to take your mind off the construction site happening a mere two inches south of your nose? I hope so because distractions are an enormous help. Maybe your dentist has a television. Maybe the patient rooms are wired for sound via satellite radio? If not, then provide your own distraction. Bring your favorite music. Don’t forget those noise canceling headphones to drown out the sound of drilling. Better yet, how about a soothing, meditative music session? Speaking of mediation. Using mindfulness meditation is fantastic for calming and centering your mind. 4. Breathe, Slow and Deep Breathing is easy right? Well, yes and no. Of course, it’s an automatic action. Air in. Carbon Dioxide Out. But anxiety has a way of spoiling things. But by using some simple, yet effective, breathing exercises can get you get calm before your next dental procedure. 5. Take a Time Out Sometimes you just need a break. When anxiety builds up and you begin to feel claustrophobic let your dentist know right away. Make sure you have a signal for this. The half-time hand signal worked well for me, but you can makeup your own secret code. 6. Anti-Anxiety Supplements If you’re taking anti-anxiety meds and they are working for you, great. But keep in mind that there are natural supplements designed to reduce anxiety. L-Theanine, Valerian Root, and Omega 3-Fats are champion anxiety fighters. 7. Take a Little Nap If your dental procedure requires that you be put under sedation, then this will definitely reduce anxiety. You’ll be zonked out, dreaming of all those yummy, sugary foods you shouldn’t be eating. And you’ll be done before you know it. If your anxiety is really severe, and no other anxiety reduction techniques work for you, ask your dentist about sedation dentistry. But before you do that, consider… 8. Challenging Your Thoughts and Fears Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) is clinically proven effective in lessening dental anxiety. That’s because CBT arms you with techniques for facing and challenging your fears and thought patterns. This study showed that 79 percent of participants were able to get through a dental visit without sedation thanks to Cognitive Behavioral Therapy. Just so you know, there are other therapy programs besides CBT for calming anxiety. I hope this article helps you on your journey to better mental health!

How Bullet Journaling Helps Me Manage My Anxiety,"But after graduating, things changed: what I studied became my real job, my only source of income, and my life circled around my work schedule. Somehow, and much faster than I’d like to admit, certain things that used to rule my every day life faded into the background. I wasn’t reading or writing, and about two months into the post-grad life, my creativity was at an all time low. This lack of creativity began to affect my daily life. I was struggling to find a balance between what I love to do and what I currently have to do, which is not to say I don’t love and enjoy my job. However, my job doesn’t require me to focus my energy on creating — and creating is what I’d been focusing on for the past four years. But also, to be honest, I wasn’t making the time to sit down and do it either. For me, creating isn’t so much about waiting for an idea to hit, but more so about sitting down and putting in the work. I felt as if I didn’t have the time to devote to creating any longer. This began to give me anxiety about where my life and dreams were headed. Questions would race through my mind at night: had I wasted the past four years studying something I’d never find the time to pursue now that I had found something I was good at and also paid the bills? Did I even remember what creating something even felt like any more? Why do all of my friends seem to find the time for their art and their jobs? It was in one of these 3 in the morning, anxiety-ridden question fests that I scrolled past a cute little Instagram video about bullet journaling. I spent the next half hour scrolling through Google, watching tutorials on what it was all about, and how to start. The next day, I went out and bought myself a journal and some fancy pens to start off. I’d decided to start here with creating, to start small and see where it took me. At first, I followed the tutorials: I made sections here and there for myself and then began customizing my journal to suit my own needs. That is the great thing about bullet journaling: it can be both tailored to your needs and edited. And so, I kept on with it. And like anything you’re expected to do daily, I wasn’t the greatest at keeping it in mind at first. I wrote my first entries and didn’t touch it for a couple of weeks. The initial excitement of nice new pens and a fresh journal wore off and it sat at the bottom of my purse, along with pieces of gum, bobby pins, and pennies. Somehow still, my anxiety won. My anxiety is a funny, pervasive thing that nags at me until I have no choice but to pay attention to it. I couldn’t escape the feeling that I was losing my creative self which I had fought for and defended for years. So I dug it out. I began to truly make a practice of using my bullet journal, even for small, seemingly insignificant notes. I refused to give up on this one thing because it felt right, even as it felt forced. I pulled it out at meetings to write down deadlines, jotted down songs I wanted to download, made a list of books people told me to read. I stopped pressuring myself to have a perfect journal and let it create itself to fit my life. And so, it did. After about a month of giving bullet journaling my all, I realized I felt positive about my life, work, where I was headed as a creator, and how all of these parts overlap and intersect. My bullet journal became a tangible place where all of these things could come together, coexist, and find their place and time in my life. It became a practice. It is both my grocery list and event tracker, containing my daily observations and motivations. A place for work and play, which eases my mind about my lack of inspiration and drive when it comes to creating content. I was able to take blank pages and transcribe my life onto them in a way that works just for me. When inspiration hits, I write it down and it’s there, waiting for me to flesh it out and make something of it when I get home from work. It’s a home for one line poems and words that spark something in me. It helps me visually see what my next few weeks look like, but also how I’m currently feeling in the present moment. Bullet journaling helped me find equilibrium when I felt my creativity was slipping through my fingers. It created an answer for my anxieties about post-grad life and what that meant for me as a content-creator. It doesn’t have to be seamless or make much sense, it just has to work for you. Here are some quick links that will help you get started with bullet journaling: (1) The Bullet Journal webpage, (2) the Rhodia Webnotebook , and a three pack of Sharpie pens. The official Bullet Journal webpage helped me set up my journal along with giving me a visual representation of my options. They sell their own bullet journal, but my tried and true so far has been the Rhodia Webnotebook. The pages are thick and dotted and it feels sturdy in my hands. Paired with the Sharpie pens, this has been my go-to perfect combination. There are a variety of options out there as far as journals and pens and finding what you like will definitely inspire you and ease your practice of bullet journaling.

On Anxiety & Other Monsters: Part 2,"Despite my best efforts, I still manage to suck at life. Despite taking an antidepressant, I still manage to have bad days. Remove the shiny gloss of the internet and you’ll find a sub-thirty-year-old man weeping on the couch. It’s quite specular when your four-year-old daughter comforts you in her squeaky, undeveloped voice. “It’s okay, Mr. Giggles thinks you’re cool.” Two events, on different ends of the timeline, can trigger a bad day. First, an event that looms in the distance, on average one to three days away. This could be: …something at work I’m never done before and I’m nervous about. ..a mistake I made and I’m scared of the consequences. …a conversation that I know is coming and dreading. We all get nervous about events in our life but an anxious person amplifies it until it becomes unbearable. It can be Friday night and I’m focused on that event scheduled for Tuesday. Forget Saturday. Forget Sunday. Forget Monday because Tuesday is the king of my thoughts. On the other side of the timeline, and equally as worse, is the event that is happening right now and I didn’t expect it. This isn’t so much the anxious side of me but the irritable side created by the anxious monster in me. An example: I was planning on having a quiet evening watching television and I find out when I get home from work that we’re going to a party. And not any party, but a party with strangers. (Now I need to figure out a conversation, smile all night, and have a positive outlook on life; three things that are exhausting to me) And when either of these events happens, the bad day begins. The key here is focus. When healthy, I can focus my attention on what is important in the moment. I can prioritize my time. On a bad day, my focus is driving blind down the highway, crashing into the sunset, and leaving victims in the ditch. It makes me impatient. Everything, even the tiniest thing, annoys me and I take my frustration out on the people around me. Wife: Can you pick up the laundry? Me: Do you really think I can think about that right now? WE ALL GET NERVOUS ABOUT EVENTS IN OUR LIFE BUT AN ANXIOUS PERSON AMPLIFIES IT UNTIL IT BECOMES UNBEARABLE. In the moment, I can tell you I’m in a bad mood. I can even express the event that is forcing me to be in a bad mood. But I can’t shake the feeling. My anxiety is severe. It’s constant. I can’t turn it on and off. You might find me sitting on the couch. I’m not watching television, playing a game, or reading. I’m sitting. A trigger can follow me all day. If I’ve seen how much I’ve hurt my family, I can sometimes get myself under control. At worst, it will affect every day until the event happens. With time, I get better at it. I can predict what is going to trigger a bad day and try to resolve the issue. Surprise triggers are difficult. Only experience prepares you for them. My wife has learned to give me as much notice as possible. Even a few hours makes a difference. I need to have a conversation with my wife. She needs to be understanding in the moment (which she always is) and help guide me through the thought process. Here’s a real example: Me: I forgot to do a report at work and had to scramble to get it done at 4:45pm on Friday. It was due that day and my boss wasn’t able to get it in on time. I’m afraid she’s going to yell at me on Monday morning. (looming in the distance) Wife: What’s the worst that could happen? Me: I get fired, lose the house, have to move us back in with my parents. Wife: Okay, what’s realistically the worst thing that could happen? You have a good relationship with your boss, right? Me: Yes, probably she has a conversation with me about being more organized and on top of things. Wife: Okay, what’s the best case? Me: Monday comes around and no one cares and we go on with our job. Wife: Is there anything you can do to resolve the situation now? Me: I can think of some new organization ideas so this doesn’t happen again. Wife: Okay. That’s a good idea. Can you do anything else right now? Me: No. Wife: Alright, on Monday, we’ll talk about it right before you go into work. It will be okay. If your boss does yell at you, curses you out, does that mean you’re less of a person? Me: No. Wife: Will I still love you? Me: Yes. Wife: &%!$ yeah I will. Can you guess what happened? I thought about it all weekend. That’s what anxiety does but I was able to function “normally” through the weekend. On Monday, my boss never mentioned the report. Life goes on. I have never gone through something that ended in disaster and ruined my life. At the end of the day, everything is going to be okay. Nothing is ever perfect but life goes on and a supportive community won’t let you wither away. After going through so many experiences like this, you think I would begin to recognize the pattern. To sum up, if someone shows a pattern of not giving a crap, after awhile, I should not give a crap either. I HAVE NEVER GONE THROUGH SOMETHING THAT ENDED IN DISASTER AND RUINED MY LIFE. 1) Empathy. In those moments, try to find common ground. I remember sitting at a party, having a hard time because I didn’t know anyone. I didn’t want to have any conversations. A friend came over and we talked about how nervous we were and how many people we didn’t know and you know what, it made me laugh. The rest of the party was fine. 2) Don’t point out the obvious. When I’m having a bad day, I know it. I know I’m being a jerk. I know my words are rude. Instead, I need some love because, in that moment, my self-esteem is low and my outlook on life is suffering. I need to know you’re on my side. Later on, I’ll apologize. 3) Have some humor. Here’s a little inside secret. All my favorite television shows are half-hour sitcoms. Why? Because I take life so seriously that I need to laugh. On bad days, you might even find me watching cartoons. It helps take the edge off. [The second part of an on-going series on alexhansmartin.com.

Everything is A-Ok,"It seems almost every time I take to my computer and clack away at the keyboard to write, it’s sparked by some form of life changing event; be it retiring from a sport I had dedicated over a decade to, graduating college, or losing a loved one, I wind up drawing together some amount of collected thought, developing something internally profound and presenting it in a loosely organized manner that hopefully a few people can power through — often with a call-to-action to boot! This is no different, but it is the likely most important collection of words I’ve strung together yet. A recent episode of This is Us has been making its rounds on the internet lately, accompanied by an equally ubiquitous Huffington Post article by Lindsay Holmes detailing the accuracy with which show portrayed the crippling reality of anxiety attacks. I’ve seen it reposted a number of times on Twitter and Facebook, and while I wouldn’t grant it true virality, I have to praise all those involved in helping spread the message (even if it comes with a sponsored plug for Chevrolet, so don’t forget to buy a Silverado…or whatever). This anecdote aims to lift yet another proverbial weight off my chest, and encourage individuals to go beyond the mere “O man, that’s some real shit.” reaction to the This is Us episode, to proactively support those around them coping with the same frustrating reality of anxiety. Better yet, if this reaches anyone who can relate, I pray that they open up about it and don’t deal with it alone! My first panic attack came in late October, the second came the day before Thanksgiving, the third on December 4th, again on December 8th, again on the 17th, and most recently on February 11th. Each one as seemingly random and senseless as the last. For the TV show, they serve the story perfectly and make it easier for the audience to understand. These attacks represent exasperated symptoms of something more subtle and diabolical; they’re the thorns of a creepy plant whose roots run much much deeper. Whether it’s truly just been these past 5 months or more subtly the past 5 years, I don’t know. Ask anyone from my college years and you’ll know I took it upon myself to deal with issues on my own, internalizing stress in what I thought was the best and most logical method. As a varsity athlete in a Division 1 sport, what other choice did I have? Turns out a lot, but my pride was too great for me to recognize it. I still excelled in my sport and academics, and had a healthy social life, so what really did I have to worry about? Fast forward to Fall/Winter 2016, attempting to adjust to a cross-country move, timidly reentering the intimidating (and vast) singles realm, along with typical work stress, topped off with the loss of a family icon…let’s just say internalizing the stress wasn’t working. The family motto, “suck it up and go,” means well and holds value, but hasn’t ever really been explained well and is misperceived more as“shut up and go.” I have no stats on this, but the general consensus I see and hear online when it comes to dealing with depression and anxiety, is just that. Perhaps not a curt as “shut up,” but brushed off nonetheless. It’s not that simple though. It’s not just “be happy,” “appreciate your life,” “this is just a phase,” “you’ll cheer up eventually,” because it’s about so much more. I don’t count myself depressed or unhappy, I have so much to be thankful for, so much to love, to much to look forward to, and so much to share. For fuck’s sake, I HAVE A CORGI (he’s amazing). Life in many ways is great, but like depression, anxiety isn’t logical. It’s not what you think it is or think it should be. It doesn’t care that things are good or bad. It’s just there. Anxiety is a like being wrapped up in a blanket, except the blanket is freezing cold, and you’re wrapped so tight that your feet get uncomfortable, and then you can’t unwrap yourself and then you’re rolling around and then holyshitwhycantigetoutofthisblanketijustwantedtogotobed AH! It’s being in an every day normal situation that you know is in fact an every day normal situation, and you have literally nothing to worry about, but for some reason a cloud with a bit of mist (not rain) is hovering over your head just to make you uncomfortable. It’s like receiving a visit from a shady door-to-door salesmen that you uncontrollably said “uh yeah come in” for no explainable reason, and he goes to your living room to sit their quietly and well…make you anxious as you look for a way to get him out, but damn you just have no words. It’s just there. On the best days, there’s nothing. On good days, there’s maybe a little something that triggers some form of dark thought but you preoccupy your mind with activities and work and move on. On bad days any number of triggers arise to permeate for as long they’d like. The worst days may look like a panic attack, but that could be something different every time. It can be an overwhelming since of doom, that spikes your heart-rate and drives you into short lived internal hysteria. It can be numb hands and blurred vision, with pressure on your chest like a 100lb weight. It can be, as Randall depicts, dissociation, shortened breath, crying. It can be so many things. But these things, if handled don’t have to be life crippling. It doesn’t have to ruin your day-to-day lifestyle, and shouldn’t. Randall is obviously a ‘success’ by modern standards, and lives what many would consider a happy and comfortable lifestyle (if a little disfunctional). I may not be driving $100,000 Mercedes S-Class like him, but I am pursuing my dreams in Los Angeles and seizing an opportunity many never have the chance to attempt. But the anxiety looms at some point or another. It’s just there. There is nothing to be embarrassed about. Nothing to be ashamed of. Nobody dealing with anxiety or depression is less of human, less capable, less intelligent, strong, important or loved. What about a burden? Nope. Annoying? Nope nope. Helpless? Hell no. Helplessness is a clouded perception left largely untouched by the media and pop culture. Until now. As Holmes states on Huff Post, any time an influential vehicle like a critically acclaimed TV show, movie, or celebrity comes out supporting the cause is a step in the right direction. Recognizing that I was dealing with something beyond what I could understand, and quickly seeking assistance through my family, friends, mentor, and even a counselor, was the best decision I could have ever made. And I’m open about it with my roommates and colleagues. People will not shy away from you if they are truly your friend. Having that support system is crucial. Which is why I hope any of you reading this far (chopping their way through spelling error, comma splice, run on sentence and rambled words galore, surely) hear those friends of yours out; understanding or offering advice isn’t even necessary, just listening and being there is huge. Even if you think it’s the littlest of things (and it really could be) listening with sincere attention could do the world of good. There a host of things I do to curb the symptoms and push that shady salesmen out the door. Taking a break from work to walk outside, playing with my dog, deep breathing exercises, even some light meditating before bed (not what you think it is either, check out Wherever You Go There You Are by Jon Kabat-Zinn, exceptionally good book on mindfulness). Exercising regularly will help for sure, I’ll get there eventually. But at the end of the day, seeing that episode of the show, hearing from friends after they saw it, seeing people take notice, and everything involving human interaction is the absolute best medicine. You can indeed “suck it up and go,” but sucking it up doesn’t mean standing silent. It means throwing away the pride or embarrassment, and being strong enough to seek assistance. You’re never as alone as you may feel. Maybe this post does something for somebody. For somebody dealing with anxiety, maybe even depression. Maybe a friend or family member of somebody dealing with it. Maybe somebody with more eloquent writing skills and a larger platform?? Make sure to H/T me? I’m happy I found the time to write this. I spent too many years not talking about what’s on my mind, and this sort of post is therapeutic. This is the sort of thing some people may call brave, which is great and I’ll admit it does take a bit to put yourself out there like this. But I’d like to live in a time when mental health illnesses, big and small, can be discussed like anything else you’d go to your doctor for. A time where it’s not brave but expected. We’re human, shit happens. Doesn’t mean you have to silently roll around in it. One of these days I’ll write something fun. Like my thoughts on the playground of political satire 2017 is gonna be, or an assessment of the video game industry’s growth over the last decade, or some shit about sports. I dunno. One day. Until next time…thanks for reading. -E Author note: I fully recognize this post could be riddled with typos and grammatical error. Feel free to harass me over it. I’ll edit it sometime.

I Meditated Every Day for 3 Months. Here’s What Happened,"Every morning I got up and listened to a Meditation podcast. Meditation for me wasn’t as pretty as some people make it look. I looked angry while I meditated and I would fall asleep from time to time, but for me I made the conscious decision to be present. I stumbled on Mediation at a pretty early age. When I was in college I took a meditation class as a one credit unit. Every time I entered Mr. A’s class, he would go around and talk about the presence of being in the hear and now. I thought most of it was a load of crap, so I would fall asleep. Every class, I fell asleep. Sometimes I would sing “Easy Lover,” by Phil Collins. Yes, that random song, soothed me off to dream land. As a type A, ENTJ female, my natural inclination is to effectively get task done, and for me meditation seemed like a less efficient way of doing. In my mind meditation was not a serious way to be in the world. The sad truth is in college I suffered from depression, and frequent anxiety attacks but no one knew because I as always trying to get ish done. #TypeA Fast forward to now. I just finished my three month long meditation routine and what an empowering experience it has been. In all honesty, I’ve had some of the most traumatic experiences happen in the past 3 months, including losing two amazing people in my life. Meditation helped my grieving process. Everyday I got up and meditated even if that meant falling asleep while the podcast was going on. Mediation is the act of taking scared time out for yourself. Even if you honor two minutes of your time that is helping you become the best version of yourself. In a time where we need to look inward in order to make long lasting change, taking time for yourself will provide you opportunities and rewards. So if you’re feeling burnt out or something FEELS off, ask yourself: Am I being present or am I looking my endless to do list? If you’re looking at the to-do list, it’s time to take two minutes and meditate. Because there is no such thing as being efficient enough, if you’re not taking care of yourself.",2017
Day 211 — I had a panic attack at a party,"I’ve been sick for the last week and busy with my brother’s wedding, hence the lack of daily posts. I’m finally feeling better now so I can finally talk/write again. So I was out with some friends recently when I started to feel a panic attack coming on. Everything suddenly got louder, I started sweating and felt so isolated even though I was surrounded by happy people. It’s difficult to describe how alone I felt in that moment. I have never had an attack like this before, out in public with so many people around. I had to think quickly. Voices were getting louder and I was growing more uncomfortable with each passing second. I decided to take myself out of the equation and leave to get fresh air. I couldn’t believe that I was even in this situation where my anxiety and mental health was impacting my life again. When I would go to therapy, I had to fill in a form that asked if I would avoid doing something like seeing people because of my mental health and for the last few months had always selected ‘no’. Yet here I was, leaving a room full of people because I couldn’t hack it. I left and saw people from the party smoking outside. Perfect. This won’t be awkward at all. So then I decided to just start walking away. Recently I have been dealing with my attacks by eating some fruit to give my body something else to do rather than feel like the world is going to stop. So I walked over to Sainsbury to get some oranges (whatever the little ones are, I call every orange fruit an orange, sue me). Oranges and milkybar bought, I still had this attack coming on. So I found a quiet street and just waited for it to come and happen. My therapist said it’s alright to just let it happen and get on with things after, process it later. So that’s what I did. I ate my snacks, had my panic attack out in the cold, composed myself and then walked back into the party. I got through it and I’m really glad I went back to the party too. It wasn’t the end of the world and I learned from it. If something similar happens again down the road, I’ll probably deal with it in the same way. I hope this post can help you in some way.",2017
The dreaded visitor in the night — PTSD,"The other day started out great and continued that way. We went to new seasons, got our Sunday breakfast, did the crossword together, then to the store for ingredients for dinner. Getting home, we geared up for a four mile run, which was invigorating. The rest of the day and evening was lovely and chill. I went to sleep happy and content. Then she came to me and the next 24 hours went to hell. You see, she rarely comes to me in dreams. As you have read prior, she is in that locked vault of denial preserving my sanity. Maribella Rose Maitri Willard. Sometimes I need to type that out to remind myself she existed. Believe me, I don’t forget, but my brain sometimes likes to play tricks on me (again, trying to preserve my sanity). I can’t remember the context of the dream, however, I remember the end where she was running up to me, and came so close to my face, hair wild, twinkle in her eye. She said to me, “hi mommy!” I said, Bells, it’s good to see you (not like she has been dead kind of good to see you, more like one of our normal interactions used to be). I asked her if she was ready for bed. She said, yes mommy. I told her to go up and that I would be there in a minute. She hugged me tight, one of her squish hugs that I miss so much, then bounced/skipped off. She rarely walked, it was more like I can’t decide whether I want to skip or bounce kind of movement. I remember so clearly her hair bouncing up and down, and her blue princess pajamas, bare feet hitting the hardwood floor. That was one of the matching pajamas that grandma and grandpa had gotten the girls. She bounced off into darkness as I startled awake. I immediately tried to go back to sleep to go back to her, call her back, hold her and never let go. But of course, I closed my eyes and nothing was there except my rapidly beating heart. I tried to slow it down to no avail. I reached over and touched my boyfriend, to try and ground myself. Part of his arm was out of the covers, and was a little cool. The next thing my brain did was to remember touching their dead bodies in the funeral home, and how cool they were. I remembered holding her and stroking that wild hair, tamed down then by the hello kitty hairband. Touching that cold unnatural skin. My brain then went into a tail spin that no matter what I did, I could not pull myself out of. I did not want to wake him, because, well, I did not want to put any of this in his head. I don’t know how long I stayed awake, I do remember the horrific path my brain went on… Luckily I have the ways to deal with my PTSD pretty down, and they mostly work. It is such a regular occurrence in my life, I have had to learn, otherwise I would be in a curled up ball on the ground most of the time. It is more the rare occasion that these techniques don’t work. This was one of those. I have never been in the center of a tornado, but I imagine it may be like this. Your brain swirling around in memories, you desperately trying to get out of this vortex of pain, yet the momentum of it all keeps you in. Every time I was able to tame down one atrocious thought, another popped up much like the weeds in my garden. I got up to pee, and coming back he asked if I was ok. I said, yeah. Again, what could I say, no, I am thinking of Maribella right now, and totally freaking out, and can’t stop thinking of that little girl alive, how I found her that dreaded evening, and then at the funeral home? Yeah, no. At some point, hours later, I finally drifted off to sleep. Of course minutes later I thought I heard my dog throwing up in the living room. I had “thought” that the night before, and she had (that is what happens when she is a bad girl and eats a stick of butter, it upsets her stomach, imagine that). So I deliriously got out of bed, cleaned it up, and crawled back in. I believe I fell asleep finally as light counteracted the darkness of the night. When I finally had gotten a couple of hours under my belt, I found him on the couch where I crawled into his arms and just about cried. I told him a little, and he held me tight, which is what I needed. You see, there are no words to say in these moments. The normal words of it’s going to be ok do not apply. I got up to go home as I needed to get stuff to go to work in a few hours. As I drove home, then to work, my brain flashed here and there, not giving me the break I was so desperately needing. I wondered how on earth I was going to make it through work. Of course I did, focusing on the care of others helps. But as the day progressed, more memories infiltrated. Checking in to say hi at the end of the day, he asked me how I was doing, and said honestly, not fabulous. I said, hey, you want to come over for dinner? I don’t know if he just loves my cooking or got that I needed him. But he came over, we all ate, and Raffi, he and I had our re-match of the game Clue. I laughed, which is so what I needed to break out of that tornado. As we lay down to sleep later, I was exhausted, felt the results of all the flight or fight hormones going through my system as well as the deep exhaustion that comes from the onslaught of all those memories. Our language fails in eloquence and depth often. Over the past almost three years now, I have had such amazing support in times like these from friends and family. And, lacking this ability to truly portray how I really feel, a deep feeling of gratitude along with what feels like the meek words thank you tumbles out. As I held his hand, my mind slowly releasing its grip from consciousness, my heart felt the first peace it had that day, and I was so grateful.

Hustling doesn’t always solve the problem.,"The fisherman could live anywhere, I suppose, but in the version of the parable I heard, he lived in Mexico and was taking a business executive from the U.S. on a fishing trip. Impressed by his guide’s skill, the businessman asks the fisherman why he doesn’t expand operations: “You could buy more boats. Hire more fishermen. Catch more fish. Open up processing facilities. I could help you find investors, and you could build wealth beyond your wildest dreams. You’d eventually be able to afford anything you wanted. You could….” At a certain point, the fisherman interjects: “But I already have everything I want. I fish when we need food to eat. I play with my children. I drink beers and play mariachi with my friends in the evenings, and at night, I go home and sleep beside my wife who I love.” The executive tried to convince the fisherman that he needed to build wealth (and complexity) in order to have a better life. But the fisherman already enjoyed his simple life. More wealth (and complexity) would not make it better. Go figure. When you are content, more isn’t more. Chronic discontentment is the Achilles’ heel of most entrepreneurs. In the midst of frenetic pursuit, relentless hustle and grind, we don’t slow down and enjoy the good, simple gifts we already have. Bigger, louder, more complex blessings and rewards beckon from just around the corner. Rather than linger and savor, we run pellmell toward that ideal future. The tension between my ambition and my desire for contentment and simplicity became apparent the other night when I was hanging out with my business partner Nathan and Closeup.fm’s acting CTO Jordan. Nathan is good at putting things in their proper place, and in all honesty, early in our partnership, after the honeymoon phase had ended, his habit of maintaining a healthy life rhythm irritated me. He’d go surfing, and I’d smolder. I’d smolder because I wanted to go fly fishing instead of answer emails. I thought I was sacrificing more. In fact, he would tell you that in that season, I worked harder on the company than he did — even when I didn’t want to. More frustrating was the fact that, even then, I couldn’t have told you with total confidence that all that hustle was necessary. Hustling was more compulsion than tangible contribution. This capacity to put my nose down and work hard was, I thought, a sign of my maturity and commitment. But I fought back exhaustion — all the time. Basecamp’s Jason Fried said it well in a recent Medium post, entitled “The Calm Company (our next book)”: “Long hours, excessive busyness, and lack of sleep have become a badge of honor for many people these days. Sustained exhaustion is not a badge of honor, it’s a mark of stupidity.” Time passed, adversity came and went, and Nathan and I grew both as individuals and as partners. I gained perspective and saw that, in many respects, the very idea of “startup life” requires one to suspend common sense. Nathan and I have both run small businesses, and common sense — for example, “My company needs to make more money than it spends” — enabled both of us to achieve profitability. The profitability of our respective businesses put both of us in a position to invest startup capital in Closeup.fm, and this capital fed our company during its infancy. You’ve heard the saying, “He had more money than sense.” That applies to young founders of early-phase startups, as well as the nouveau riche. In our pursuit of some ideal of hockey-stick growth trajectory, we embraced irony and set aside the very habits and business practices that had secured our seats at the poker table and enabled us to ante up in the first place. If nothing else, the startup world has a big population of people with strong opinions, and if you’re not careful, you’ll be trying to “scale” a service or a product before people are actually buying it. You cannot multiply zero. Zero multiplied by a billion bags of unicorn glitter is still zero. Oops. Here’s the thing: All those entrepreneurs, investors, and advisors were trying to help us after their own fashion. No one intentionally gave us bad advice. It’s not like we were enough of a threat to attract saboteurs. No one is to blame for any ill-conceived notions of product development, go-to-market strategy, or lean startup methodology except the two men at the helm. But after the smoke from the startup accelerators, funding warpath, and equity negotiations cleared, I gained more clarity: I really just want to help people. I want to make a tangible, positive impact on thousands of lives. If building Closeup.fm into a billion-dollar company serves that bigger goal, great. But as far I as I’m concerned, wealth worth having comes as a by-product of making people’s lives better. When I look around at my life, I see abundance already. Maybe I can think more like the fisherman. That true and humbling observation brings me to the point that Nathan and Jordan were hammering: I have a choice. We can choose chronic discontentment and run ourselves ragged. We can also choose to exercise contentment here and now. To be sure, we inherit a certain diagnosis of success from parents and public figures, pastors and major players in our industries, and then we start looking for the symptoms in our own companies. Am I successful? So-and-so seems to be growing at a faster clip. I thought we’d be in a different place by now. What are we doing wrong? There’s certainly room for reflection, for closer examination of one’s raison d’être and the company’s too. But what if that diagnosis is wrong from the start? What if, like the fisherman, a deeper, more tranquil enjoyment of your life is already within reach? What if you don’t want a whole fleet of boats, massive canning operations, and luxurious homes in twelve countries? What if you’d prefer to take more naps on the beach and sleep next to your faithful wife in the modest bungalow you share? What if you come to believe that your children need your presence and undivided attention more than they need more electronics and pricey life programming? A fundamental part of the human condition is the quest for more, but even so, all of us can choose to practice contentment along the way. We can establish a regular cadence of thankfulness. We can stop and savor. Hustling doesn’t solve the problem. Whatever the ripe opportunity or rotten situation, it can wait until Monday. In the past I have obsessed over such situations. They catch like burrs in the wool of my mind. I would have no peace until I bring them to some resolution. More from Jason Fried: “Stress is an infection passed down from organization to employee, from employee to employee, and then from employee to customer.” “Stress can not be contained. It never stops at the edge of work. It always bleeds into life. It infects your relationships with your friends, your family, your kids.” I have experienced this firsthand. Nose glued to my iPhone, I’m so preoccupied with maneuvering for a potential deal or putting out a client’s fire that I ignore my daughter trying to show me her drawing. That isn’t wisdom. Can I still find a center of peace and live out of it in the Unresolved? Yes. I am not a victim. I can choose peace in the midst of loose ends and open loops. What about the piqued sense of fairness and the anxious static that I feel after reading an email full of passive-aggressive jabs? Chances are, I never should have opened my email in the first place. But without thinking, I did, and now I can address it the way I would other tasks. Jordan said he opens a voice memo and speaks his response. To take that simple action enables him to hush the negative emotion that the email caused. Later, once the initial heat has passed, he can send a quick, dispassionate reply: “Received. Will ponder and respond in-depth or call on Monday.” When the time comes to remedy the situation, he can do so with a mind not muddied by anger or resentment. He can stay true to his commitment to maintain poise and respond with integrity and kindness even to rude, aggressive, and vindictive people. The deeper disappointment comes not from faith lost in other people but from not living out of the best versions of ourselves. I will not reduce my life to a series of knee-jerk reactions. I choose instead to live out of the best version of myself. In her book The Barefoot Executive Carrie Wilkerson talks about how her business needs her to be at her best. In order to avoid getting bushwhacked by trolls, she has designed little protocols and systems. For example, rather than respond to support emails from cranky customers herself, she loops in her assistant. Because her assistant is not emotionally invested in the product like Carrie, the product’s creator, she can engage with cranks and trolls without allowing the injustice of it all to shut her down. Wilkerson also talks about scheduling a quarterly review, identifying consistently negative people, and cutting them out of her business and life. Whatever you think of that particular practice, you can see the value of taking a step back from your life and business, remembering your real goals, and then changing your perspective on the urgency of this task or that request. What if, like the fisherman, you already have what you want? Or most of what you want? And by failing to recognize that you not only fail to enjoy the present but you allow anxiety to shape the future? You don’t have to pursue someone else’s definition of success. You don’t have to entertain misplaced opinions. You can choose to practice gratitude, peace, and contentment at this very moment. Nettlesome situations can wait until Monday. In fact, you can design little protocols and workflows to protect your creativity and optimism. Your capacity for hustle is a gift, a gift that you can waste, and the real disappointment stems from not acting out of the best version of myself. So today I hope you’ll join me in choosing to be at peace and to enjoy the simple gifts already in your life. “Anxiety isn’t a prerequisite for progress.” — Jason Fried +++ If you found value in this blog post, please subscribe below.

3 Steps to Overcome Debbie Downer Syndrome.,"I remember when I learned there was a technical name for it. Making “negative predictions”. Expecting not to enjoy a party, check. Expecting to feel too tired to exercise, check. Expecting that your boss won’t like an idea, etc., check, check. They oozed out so naturally that I never really took time to think about them. Saying I was prone to “negative predictions” was an understatement. I thought them ALL the time. But I always thought that that was just me. My personality. Just the way I was. In my defense, it wasn’t like I was a Debbie Downer. As a matter of fact my friends and coworkers would have been shocked to learn of this personality trait of mine. Well, as it turns out this is pretty common. And as it turns out, we’re not up a creek without a paddle. Negative predictions are highly treatable because they are simply habits. (They are not a part of our DNA.) And like all habits you want to stop, a plan and practice is your ticket outta there. So here is your three step plan: Repeat steps 2 and 3 until you have moved past the negative prediction. It is important to note that you are not trying to insert the opposite (Positive Paula) and you aren’t trying to rationalize why you shouldn’t think negatively about this or that. Life is too short to substitute ineffective habits for bad habits. What do you routinely use your negative prediction powers on?

Could Thinking Positively Be Dangerous Right Now?,"Interview with Russ Harris If, like me, you’ve started opening the newspapers each day with a sense of dread and disbelief about that latest actions of President Trump and his administration, it can be hard to figure out exactly what you’re meant to do with these feelings. Should you be protesting loudly? Trying to trust the checks and balances of government? Or hoping someone braver than you will step in and rescue us? The truth is that when you’re feeling fearful it’s natural for your mind to get caught up in lots of thoughts about worse case scenarios for what might happen in the future. And these can fuel your anxieties and cause you to spiral downwards towards feelings of overwhelm, despair and even depression. One way psychologists suggest dealing with these thoughts is to reframe them by recognizing these worse case scenarios as the stories that they are, gently challenging yourself to find other equally plausible and more optimistic explanations and then investing your attention and energy into the stories that serve you best until you have more information. This optimistic explanatory style has been found to help improve your resilience, your performance and your wellbeing. For example, it could be true that President Trump’s efforts to restrict Muslims from entering the United States will create more pain and hatred in the world from which we’ll never really recover. It could also be true that his efforts will result in more connection and love in the world as people choose to take a stand against religious intolerance and racism. It’s easy to imagine how each of these stories would leave you thinking, feeling and acting in quite different ways. But is trying to reframe negative emotions into more optimistic explanations the best way to deal with our discomfort? Is thinking positively actually dangerous for us? “You can’t expect to stop difficult emotions such as anxiety, fear, or self-doubt arising in challenging or difficult situations,” explained Russ Harris psychotherapist, world-renowned trainer of Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT), coach and best-selling author of The Happiness Trap when I interviewed him recently. “But instead of trying to control these thoughts and feelings, by just accepting them as a normal part of reality, you can then choose to act in a way that reflects your heart’s deepest desires about how you want to treat yourself and others in the world around you.” Russ suggests that despite all your efforts at positive thinking, it’s not going to stop your difficult thoughts or feelings from showing up again and again during challenging times. In fact, research has found that trying to suppress your negative thoughts can actually backfire on you, and leads to an increase of negativity. “You need to give all your emotions the space to come and go” says Russ. “But rather than passively abandoning yourself to them, or responding in an automatic pilot mode that can lead to self-defeating behaviors — such as procrastinating, losing your temper, or gossiping — be guided by your values to choose what actions you can take in the face of challenges.” How can ACT help you live your values in the face of challenges? Russ provides three strategies to living your life according to your deepest heart-felt values: · Be present — anchor yourself in the moment by bringing your awareness to either the physical world around you or the psychological world within you, or to both, rather than running on “automatic pilot.” Get back into your body by taking a couple of deep breaths, pushing your feet into the floor, or having a stretch, and notice where you are, what you can see, touch, taste, and smell around you. Be truly present to what’s unfolding and how it’s making you feel. For example, try anchoring your feet to the floor next time you read about President Trump, take some deep slow breaths and notice how his actions are making you feel. · Open up — unhook yourself from negative or self-critical thoughts and feelings, by taking a step back and seeing them as just words and images passing through your mind. Instead of fighting them, resisting them, running from them, or getting overwhelmed by them, make room for painful feelings by recognizing they are completely normal and allowing them to be as they are. Practicing self-compassion — talking to yourself like a wise and kind friend might — can be helpful to acknowledge the pain you’re feeling and offer yourself comfort. Of course, this doesn’t mean liking them or wanting them, just that you’re willing to make room for them. For example, if you’re feeling afraid, dismayed or overwhelmed by President Trump’s choices, recognize that these feelings are completely natural and allow them to be felt. Let the feelings and thoughts pass through you, so you can put your energy into living your values and doing the things that make life meaningful. · Do what matters — Deep in your heart, you know what you stand for and want your life to be about. Tap into these values and use them as a compass to guide you towards taking the kind of committed actions that make your life rich, full, and meaningful. Values-guided actions may not always be pleasant or pain-free, but they are the things worth doing. For example, if love and connection are important values you hold, then start taking committed actions to bring more of this into the world right now. It might be practicing loving kindness meditation each morning, reaching out to people of other religions or races and offering words of support, or joining peace marches to make your voice heard. What can you do to accept your negative emotions and commit to taking value-driven action in these challenging times?",2017
"Take that, existential crisis that never happened.","Breathing through the anxiety Anxiety is never a one size fits all experience. There are as many triggers, intensities, frequencies, responses, durations and forms of anxiety as there are people to experience them. And so, the question isn’t whether or not we become anxious. That bug bites each of us eventually. The question is how easily and quickly and effectively we calm down after becoming anxious. For example, I’ve had experiences where anxiety took me completely by surprise. Like that time in my early twenties when I didn’t know what the hell I was supposed to do with my life and anxiety completely knocked me on my ass and resulting in curling up into the fetal position and crying alone in the corner of my apartment until I fell asleep from exhaustion. Not a great weekend. On the other hand, I’ve also had experiences where I was acutely aware of the incoming tremors on my anxiety seismograph. Like that time in my mid thirties when I was at a meeting, noticed and named my feelings of claustrophobia, nausea and disconnection, calmly removed myself from the situation and took a long walk while breathing deeply and listening to my favorite album. And within the hour, I was back to normal. Take that, existential crisis that never happened. In fact, I was quite proud of myself for recognizing, responding and recovering in such a healthy and expedient way. Too bad it took me thirteen years to learn that lesson. As my guitar teacher once said, it doesn’t matter if we break a string, only how quickly we return to the music.

3.33 am!,"My terrace has always been a good companion of mine in a time of solitariness. It is as abandoned as me so we keep up good with each other. Sitting on the block as I see the watch, its 3.33 am and here I’m still wide awake and immersed in thoughts. I have always been more inclined towards darkness. Nights has often given me some sort of freedom than days. The freedom of self-awareness while everyone is sleeping or may be the scoop of solitude, I don’t know. There is something very soothing for your anxiety when there is no one around you. You feel like you behold the place. The fluidity of the space allows the bubble of your imagination to expand while there is no one to nudge it. Though it’s not same every day, is it? As I sit here procrastinating about everything I’ve done or will do, the silence seems to mock me. The sky seems to be craving to absorb me. The silence is poking me to speak but I am running out of words. I feel my demons are gazing over me as they always do. My inner self is screaming but nobody will hear it. This is the moment when solitude turns into the loneliness. And here I feel insulated from humans like never before. Something is keeping me up from sleeping. I have been trying to decipher something going in my head for a while. Anybody might come to help- After all, what is happiness? Love, they tell me. But love doesn’t bring and never has brought happiness. On the contrary, it’s a constant state of anxiety, a battlefield; it’s sleepless nights, asking ourselves all the time if we’re doing the right thing. Real love is composed of ecstasy and agony. Is it so? If you have answers, tell me, please! So as I might be able to sleep again. Originally published at The Window Seat. Check out the website here.",2017
Dealing With Drugs: A Writer’s Lament,"I’m on drugs! How many of you assumed they were illegal? Silly people. Alright, serious face, guys. I am on drugs. Every morning along with my Vitamin E (Which keeps my skin clear, seriously try it), Choline, Fish Oil, and Vitamin D (which was also prescribed by my doctor), I take a little white pill. It used to be pink, when I lived in Canada, but here in the US of A, it’s white. That little white pill is Paxil, a brand name version of Paroxetine, a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI). It tastes horrible if I don’t swallow it right away, and it’s really easy to loose in the carpet if I drop it. Paxil can be used to treat a number of things; for me though, it’s to help with Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD) and Panic Disorder. It also helps with my sporadic depressive episodes, and my chronic nightmares. Paxil takes almost two weeks to really settle into your system (it can’t be used as an emergency correction), creates pretty awful nausea and dizziness for those two weeks, as well as if you miss a dose. I took 10mg/day for almost ten years, but lately I’ve been taking 20mg/day. So, why am I telling you this? A few days ago I packed up a backpack at seven in the evening and drove to a hotel two hours away from my home spontaneously, on a mini-photography vacation. I talked about this in my last blog post, about trying new things. I had a lot of fun, and am currently sitting in a Starbucks caffeinating before I head home. There was only one major dark point to this outing. I forgot my pills. I already mentioned the nausea and dizziness that come when you miss a dose, and that part sucks. What sucks worse though, is the crippling inability to function like a normal human being. Writing this now is like pulling teeth. Each word grinds against me, each thought bumping up against the next, making everything muddled and foggy. My hands are shaky, my eyes are blurry, and I’m exhausted by a night of extensive nightmares. And that still isn’t the worst bit. The worst bit is the guilt. The feeling of inadequacy. Why can’t I be like normal people? Why can’t I manage to go one day without medicating myself? Why can’t my brain just work- Stop. I bet a lot of you have those thoughts too. That you aren’t normal; that you’re broken; that you’re somehow less then people who don’t deal with what you deal with. I have them all the time. Why though? Okay, well, the obvious answer is that I have severe anxiety, so my mind latches onto any insecurity and extrapolates. The sad thing is though, I’m not the only one who thinks these things about me. The stigma against psychological issues is slowly lessening, but it is still absolutely, horrible, painfully real. “Just deal with it.” “Everyone gets nervous.” “Stop worrying so much.” We’ve all heard it, even from the most good meaning friends. As writers and creators, there is an addition layer of complication. There is this frustrating myth that being depressed, anxious, neurotic somehow makes you a better artist. That being broken means your work will be deeper, more original, and just better. So people suffer through it for their ‘art’. This, my friends, is bullshit. If you have clinical depression, it is no different than having diabetes. It is biological, chemical, and unhealthy. So you go to your doctor, go through the painful process of admitting you can’t handle it alone, and they hand you some pretty little pills. You take those pills without question, and suddenly you are uncreative, blank, and boring. So you have to make a decision, be ‘happy’ without your art, or be miserable with it. Well, you’re on the wrong dosage. Or the wrong pill! The treatment of depression and anxiety is still new in the grand scheme of things, and it’s harder to measure than other things. Most people have to go through tons of different dosages and drugs to find the right balance. And that can CHANGE, as your get older. You might need to change it again later if it stops working. If you are on the right dosage, you shouldn’t be dull, you should be calm and focused. If you found the right drug, you shouldn’t be uncreative, you should be able to work without having a meltdown every few hours. We as creators need to DEAL with this. The stigma of mental health issues is improving, and that’s great. But the stigma of ‘suffering for your art’ is still alive, well, and frankly ridiculous. So here it is. I have GAD, Panic Disorder, and depression, and that is okay. I take 20mg/day of Paxil, 1000mg/day of Vitamin D, go to therapy, meditate and control my diet in an attempt to keep my mental health stable, and THAT is okay. I want to be happy and love myself while I create, AND THAT IS OKAY. Chart your own path. We only get to live life once. Don’t let stigma, or old wives tales, or history dictate who you are, and what you can do. Be brave. I’ll be right here.

What does your mind say?,"There are certain moments in your life when you start thinking a lot. Situations in which you get extremely overwhelmed, to a point, your thoughts are like a chain reaction. So overwhelmed that you stop living in your thoughts but instead looking at it from far away distance. Suddenly each and every thought stops meaning something to you. It is you mind’s way of letting you know to stop what you are doing. You can’t blame yourself because you can’t see what your thought at this moment. How to take action when you don’t even know what the order is. All you’re looking at, is a mist on top of the river, with mist being the thoughts and river conclusion of your thought. Is it only you? or there are other people who experience the very same thing every single day of their life. When this moment arise, you initially try to comprehend those thoughts. The first two thoughts, you’ll remember them as it will be directly related to the situation which caused it. And then, suddenly your mind would stop comprehending anything thrown at it. It is like, your mind is creating the thoughts but at the same time not trying to understand it. Mind takes a back seat, completely numb. You just know that your mind is overworking but can’t seem to understand why. It is like you started a train and you broke the switch-off lever. Interesting thing is, even though your mind has taken a back seat but your thoughts are no where near shutting down, causing your mind to be extremely tired within 15–20 mins. You feel sleepy and extremely tired after that. You have this huge strain on your forehead which you know that your thoughts are causing but how can you stop it when you can’t even comprehend your thoughts anymore. It is like, how do you see what is in the river when there is a huge mist right above it blocking the entire view. You do know what started this chain reaction of thoughts but, at this point, your mind doesn’t really care and has taken the back seat watching the entire show. You do remember the very first two thoughts which started this entire process, so you are very well aware of the things which are not going well in your life. I would love to call it a “panic attack” but I can’t. Knowingly that a panic attacks are short, repeatable, and predictable. But what I am talking about is not short, rather chronic. It does have a triggering point but now it has come to a point where you don’t even know what that is. It just becomes a part of your life or personality, I should say. Therefore, it can’t be repeated as it never ended to begin with. It can be predicted as it is always there. Now it s a part of you, a personality trait. People with this trait are anxious, worried, under-confident, and overly cautious about every aspect of their life. Some people call it, whatever phenomenon I have discussed so far, “midlife crisis.” But I think this phenomena has no name. At least, I am unaware of the name. Please, forgive my shortcoming. Those rapid firing of thoughts are not some invaluable pebbles. They have a huge meaning. Something you can look back and reflect upon in your free times while you throw each and every pebble into the pond of your brain. It greatly changes your way of thinking and your future judgment skills. But how do you relive your thoughts vividly? how do you get rid of that mist and see what lies beneath it? the only possible way I could come up with is to write! whenever you can. Whenever you write, those thoughts slow down. Suddenly that mist of the river changes into distinct blocks. Something you can feel. Writing does that. This will alow you relive every single thought you had at the time of crisis, taking home a meaning or a conclusion from it. Your mind calms down as it has answers to every thought you had at the first moment. Now your mind knows the answers of your thoughts. Your mind is no more a copper ball charged with alternative current but a bulb emitting harmonic pulsatile light. There are so many reason I can think of to why humans can experience that. Perhaps, have an OCD, or a fear of not living up to people’s expectation or fear of failure. Reasons to the above mentioned phenomena can be anything which would define the remedy you need to take but before starting the treatment you need to investigate the cause. And to investigate the cause, you need to understand what triggered it and what your mind is thinking for it.",2017
Marijuana and Anxiety: The Chicken or The Egg?,"Marijuana has long been linked to higher levels of social anxiety. Some argue that marijuana itself is the cause of social anxiety, while many users would argue marijuana is most often used to cope with pre-existing anxious conditions. In fact, many users in states that allow medical marijuana are prescribed marijuana as treatment for Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder, a particularly severe form of anxiety. Does marijuana cause anxiety, and how do rapidly changing marijuana laws impact the country’s general mental health outlook? In general, the medical consensus is that while there is certainly a strong link between marijuana and anxiety, there is little evidence to infer causation from correlation. Although, according to a 2002 study, marijuana withdrawal causes several physical and mental health side-effects, notably irritability and anxiety. If a user experiences anxiety while abstaining from marijuana, they may be more likely to continue to smoke marijuana, thus creating a cycle of anxiety-avoidance. In this circumstance, it could reasonably be said that marijuana has caused anxiety. Research has found that problematic marijuana use, heavy use that interferes with daily activity and responsibility, is typically a reliable indicator of social anxiety. However, the study concluded that when marijuana was strictly used socially or for entertainment purposes, lower levels of anxiety were reported among users. This result was replicated in a 2008 study, in which coping motives for marijuana were examined. This research suggests that motivations for marijuana use, rather than frequency, could be more predictive of mental health disorders. This information could be critical for therapists as they seek to understand their clients’ motivation for marijuana use. Understanding this information is critical for marijuana users suffering from generalized or social anxiety disorder. If you suffer from anxiety and use marijuana, it is important to ask yourself several questions about your use to develop a better understanding. First, when do you smoke marijuana? If your use occurs in social situations, or to enhance your leisure activities, your use is likely not problematic. If you find you are using marijuana to avoid negative mood states, if you feel uncomfortable in social situations without marijuana, and if you tend to avoid social situations without marijuana, your use is likely problematic. Be sure to share this information with your therapist or psychiatrist, and together you can work on more productive coping mechanisms. For mental health care providers, this information illustrates the importance of better understanding your clients’ marijuana use. As recent research suggests, motivation for use is typically a more important factor than rate of use, so be sure you fully understand your clients’ motivations for using marijuana. If providers continue to prioritize prevalence of use over motivation for use, positive mental health outcomes may become harder to achieve. As more states have voted to legalize marijuana use, both for recreational and medicinal purposes, research will likely expand in the coming years. It will be critical to continue expanding knowledge on how marijuana use relates to heightened anxiety. Future research should account for motivations for marijuana use, the relative mood states of recreational and medical users, as well as the method of ingestion, as states such as Washington and Colorado offer marijuana in edible, vapor, and oil forms. A better understanding of the relationship between marijuana and anxiety will be crucial as the country moves into the “post-prohibition” era.",2017
On Feeling Lost,"Feeling lost is in laments terms, confusing. The definition of “lost” is “no longer possessed or retained.” In my case the part of lost that I fall into is the possessed part. Possession of my own personality and attitude isn’t as strong as it used to be. It’s not so much that this has been going on for a long time. This feeling has only been permeating for about 2 or 3 weeks. The funny thing about it is that much of this feeling of being lost can easily go away. All I have to do is tell myself that the obstacles ahead are not impossible to take on. Feeling lost never truly goes away, it just comes back every now and then.",2017

The troll under the bridge takes another goat, my throat, my heart, the palpitations start. No sleep. Oh! Sleep, oh, jumping sheep. A moment in maze turns endless gaze. The roof, the lines, the sound in the street grows bigger, eyes stagger. Oh! Sleep, I look on a page In a book, but you’re gone. Big breaths, slight sweats, but you’re gone.

“Life Will Get Better” Part 2 — Nutrition,"Part 2: Nutrition Ch 2 — Nutrition Matters Ch 3 — Sugar and Artificial Sweeteners Ch 4 — Chemicals and Allergens Ch 5 — Back to Basics Ch 6 — Specific Nutrients Ch 7 — Involve Your Child in Food Related Activities This is a summary of the book “Life Will Get Better: Simple Solutions for Parents of Children with Attention, Anxiety, Mood, and Behavioral Challenges” by Nicole Beurkens, Ph.D. These are her ideas, and I’m simply picking what I think to be the high points of each chapter to make it a quicker read for parents that would find this information useful, but have busy schedules and can’t find the time to read the book in its entirety. Ch 2 — Nutrition Matters This Chapter establishes the well-known reality that there is a connection between food, mood, and behavior. Nutrition has significant effects on the brain and body and how it functions. More specifically, if your child is struggling with inattention, irritability, anxiety, hyperactivity, oppositional behavior, learning disorders, aggression, or any other related challenges, taking a look at your child’s diet and nutrition intake would be a wise decision. According to the book, there are also less visible signs that could lead you to believe there may be food related problems. That list includes dark circles under eyes, mood swings, sleep problems, frequent illness, and fatigue. There is overwhelming new science coming out suggesting the health of the gut and the health of the brain are interrelated. They are now referencing to the gut as “the second brain, “ and it is a significant player with the immune system, which is why it is so important to keep your gut and digestive system working properly with a nutritious diet. Think good nutrition, leading to good gut health, which leads to good brain health. It’s important to eat well at any stage of life, but it is vital to have a healthy diet throughout childhood because that’s when your body and brain is growing and developing. This is the most important time to have optimum “fuel” to grow. Ch 3 — Sugar and Artificial Sweeteners It is important to be able to decipher foods that are marketed as healthy but are packed full of sugar. Things like flavored milk, fruit snacks, juice, sports drink, and yogurt (I’m looking at you, Trix Yogurt) may seem to be a valid, healthy option but in reality, are loaded with preservatives and sweeteners. For such a long fat got a bad rap but it is sugar and other artificial sweeteners that are the main culprit for obesity, diabetes, and other inflammatory health conditions. Increased sugar intake leads to sharply rising and lowering of blood sugar, which is commonly known as sugar highs and sugar crashes. This is a significant contributor to mood. One tip for steering your kids clear of these kinds of snacks is, kids can’t eat what’s not provided to them. If you simply don’t buy it and don’t have it in the house, it’s not an option to eat. I encourage people to read food labels, but not necessarily the top part where it lists calories, fat, etc. But read the bottom part where the ingredients are listed. Sugar and artificial sweeteners should not be one of the first three ingredients listed. Their names for these are endless, but some of the common ones are high fructose corn syrup, Splenda, aspartame, sucralose, acesulfame potassium, neotame, and saccharin. These odd-sounding names are often found in “lite” and “diet” options. If you must use sweeteners, the book says to check options like stevia, xylitol, and erythritol. Like anything else, using sparingly is the game. Ch 4 — Chemicals and Allergens Now that everything in the store is packaged, it has to have a shelf life to stay at the grocery store long enough to sell. Enter in, artificial additives. The most basic rule you could follow when grocery shopping is, look at the ingredients, if you cannot pronounce the words, don’t buy it. How simple is that? You can also ask, would I use these ingredients in my own kitchen? These two rules will give you a pretty good indication of what to buy and what not to buy. Because most things are multifactorial in the causation of symptoms and disease (remember chapter 1), there’s no evidence that these chemicals and allergens CAUSE hyperactivity, irritability, attention issues, and the like. But there is enough evidence to show it negatively impacts these symptoms. There are artificial dyes put in food to make it look more appealing. The most common ones are Blue #1 & #2, Green #3, Red #3 & #40, yellow #5, and #6, and citrus red #2. These can have a large impact on your child’s mood and behavior. Once again, it is important to read the bottom half of the nutrition label and look at the ingredients in your food. In my opinion, it is more important than reading the top half which is what is most commonly looked at by people. It can be hard to change your child’s diet, and you may be thinking there’s no way they will cut out this processed food in exchange for fruits and vegetables. Most of the struggle will be in the first couple days, but once they realize processed foods are no longer an option (or at the least, will be used much more sparingly), it will be easier to introduce healthier foods. Ch 5 — Back to Basics The power combination: protein, fruit, vegetables, and water. These are the ingredients for more brain alertness and steady energy all day (fewer sugar highs and crashes). The first meal of the day, breakfast, seems to have the most options for high glycemic load foods. These are foods that are high in sugar and lead to sugar highs and sugar crashes. Muffins, pancakes and syrup, high sugar yogurt, juice, bagels, etc. If your child is showing constant fatigue despite getting enough sleep, look into if they’re eating high glycemic foods, especially at breakfast. Good things to try for breakfast are eggs, a small amount of cheese, fruit, and vegetables with almond butter, sun butter, or another dip. Fruits and vegetables are packed with vitamins, minerals, phytonutrients, and fiber (which helps you stay fuller, longer). The goal is to eat all colors of the rainbow. Personally, I’ve never been a big “breakfast food” eater; I’ve always preferred leftovers from last night’s dinner. This can also be a good option because dinner foods tend to have less of a glycemic load and less sugar. Possibly the most overlooked thing in one’s diet is drinking enough water. Being well hydrated will do wonders for your health. Without enough water, it has adverse effects on your brain and body. I’ve always enjoyed water. It’s never been something that I disliked or had trouble drinking enough of. But I realize many kids and adults don’t like drinking water. You can always try to make it more fun by adding fresh or frozen fruit to your child’s water. Tell them why they should drink more water. It’s not punishment; it’s because it helps their brain and body work better! The book lists a water intake recommendation for kids per day. It is as follows: 5–8 years old: 5 glasses/1 liter 9–12 years old: 7 glasses/1.5 liters 13+ years old: 8–10 glasses/2liters Side note: For adults, I’ve also been taught to drink half your body weight (pounds) in ounces. For example, if you weigh 150 pounds, take 150/2 = 75. Thus, you should be drinking at least 75 ounces of water per day. Increasing water consumption is an easy way to have a positive impact on mood, behavior, learning, and physical health. Ch 6 — Specific Nutrients If you’re trying to pick out one or two things to implement out of this entire nutrition section of the book, I would increase water consumption, and I would increase your Omega 3 intake. I don’t use the word “super food” or “super supplement” often, but I would for Omega 3 (fish oil). If there were one thing I was confident 99% of Americans were not getting enough of, it would be fish oil. That’s why virtually every single person should have a quality Omega 3 supplement. It is essential for brain health. You get Omega 3 from things like fish, seafood, grass fed meat (less inflammatory than grain fed meat), free-range eggs (less inflammatory than grain fed chickens), and avocados. Even if you are eating all these things, it is tough to get enough Omega 3 in a standard diet. Fish oil a supplement where you get what you pay for. Fish oil A, is not fish oil B, is not fish oil C. It is best not to go cheap when buying your fish oil. There are also flavored, liquid, fish oil supplements that taste great and don’t have the fishy taste or fishy burps which are perfect for kids (and adults). I use the orange flavored S03+D3 bottle of fish oil sold by SFH. Ch 7 — Involve Your Child in Food Related Activities The most common thing parents are afraid of when making these changes is that their kids won’t like it, and they won’t eat the new foods. You want to involve them in as many food-related activities as you possibly can. This lets the kids feel a part of what’s going on and gives them exposure to all the different types of foods. If they go grocery shopping with you, let them help pick out what you’re getting and let them see all the varieties of foods there are. Take them to a farmers market and let the feel all the different foods and pick out what looks intriguing to them. Look through recipe books and decide what to make together. There are cook books geared toward children that are perfect for this. Prepare snacks together by having them help count out and sort the snack into containers. (Safely) Cooking dishes together will make them more inclined to try it because they contributed in the process. Let them serve the food at the table onto everyone else’s plate. The more you expose them to, the more comfortable they’ll be with the new menu options. Don’t force them to eat something they refuse to eat; this will lead to them not enjoying that food forever. Let them come around. It is a process, and it is important you persevere through it. Any small changes you can make will be a step in the right direction. Tomorrow’s section is on Part 3: SLEEP!",2017
Social Media Anxiety Disorder,"Social Media has introduced society to an entirely new dimension of how we interact. Instead of human contact and face-to-face recognition, we can contact one another at the click of a button. Social Media has truly transformed personable interactions and meaningful conversation. For the past few years, a discovery was made that social media can actually be accredited to the rise in anxiety, and this was labeled Social Media Anxiety Disorder. This disorder focuses on the negative effects Social Media has mentally and physically to an individual, and the long-term effects. Having actual human interaction has become more difficult for young children and recent generations because of the ease we have fallen into with posting online. Contacting someone via message is much easier and less stressful than having a face-to-face confrontation, and this has lead to a decrease in overall human interaction among young adults and teenagers. I do believe Social Media can be a great thing, however, I completely see this side of the argument as well. Personally I see the effects it has everyday into my own anxiety with recognizing someone from online and not quite knowing how to interact with them. I think Social Media can easily freeze our curiosity of others, because you can easily look them up on any Social Media platform and find them within seconds. When you have the opportunity to do this, you are much less likely to express your interest in other’s lives in person, and I think this also freezes how friendships are made.",2017

Living With Anxiety,"Did you know that in any one year, around 1 million Australian adults have depression, and over 2 million have anxiety? Crazy statistics, hey? But I think we’re smart enough to know they’re true. In fact, we know they are because many of us sit amongst them. I know I do. I’ve experienced anxiety for most of my life and whilst I’ve had my moments of triumph to overcome it there have also been days where I’ve been on the verge of a meltdown. You see, anxiety is experienced differently for everyone (which is all kinds of fucked up when you want someone to relate too) but one thing remains constant for all it’s sufferers and that is the more you try to control anxiety the more it controls you. It’s a really shit situation when you think about it and becomes a repetitive, negative cycle. For me it looks something like this: ANXIOUS THOUGHT + ME TRYING TO STOP THE ANXIOUS THOUGHT = MORE ANXIOUS THOUGHTS You see the pattern here? It’s all kinds of fucked up but I hope it illustrates just how hard it can be at times for those experiencing anxiety. If you’ve never had the pleasure (and I say that sarcastically) of dealing with anxiety, I envy you, however I also want to mention a few things that you really need to stop saying to people who DO experience it. Actually, just eliminate the following sentences from your vocabulary immediately: There’s a few more I could throw in but I think you get the point. These comments/sentences are patronising, be-lilting, unthoughtful and just unnecessary. Here’s what you SHOULD be saying instead: See the difference? When someone around you is experiencing anxiety they don’t need your added shitty comments making them feel worse so if you’re only going to add fuel to the fire, shut your mouth. Okay? Whilst anxiety is experienced different for everyone, I’m making a decision to be transparent about mine. This is because I want the stigma and barriers of anxiety to be broken down. I want this to be an open conversation with authentic dialogue that connects us as opposed to distancing us. I can’t help people if I don’t show my own soul and if this piece makes a difference to even one person, the honesty would have been worth it. An overwhelming need to always be liked. SIDE NOTE: It was really fucking confronting writing that, not even kidding. Part of me is yelling to stop writing this piece now. This means I worry about social gatherings, events, friendships, relationships, conversations, text messages etc etc more than the average person would. It can be really debilitating. Who am I kidding? It IS debilitating. It’s fucking awful on most (if not all) occasions, but it’s the truth. I’m better at managing myself in moments of anxiety now than I used to be and thankfully I’m always able to pull myself from it’s hold, even on my bad days. However one important part of anxiety for me is this: It doesn’t get to rule my life, I do. I choose to think of anxiety as something I experience from time to time and yes, it is awful, but it is temporary moments of emotion that (over half a life of practice) I can control and do learn from. Do I think I’ll ever live a life without experiencing anxiety? Probably not. I’ve learned and accepted that I think too deep, care too much, worry too much and feel things on a level most people don’t and I’m okay with that. I’ve actually learned to embrace that part of myself and surprisingly, it’s made me better. Here’s to embracing ALL parts of ourselves that make us change, learn and grow. Even the ones we’re made to think are bad.",2017

Plan B,"Having a plan B or 2nd option reduces neediness and makes you more secure in your decision making. Eg: Another way to look it is, if you only have one option, you suddenly are very dependent on that option. You lose autonomy, and are more likely to do things that go against your personality or morals or desires. If you really, really, really like just one girl/guy and want to marry them, then suddenly it’s very, very, very important for you to keep them interested in you. You lose freedom. You lose self-determination. You lose confidence in who you are. But what if you had a plan B for life itself? We know that having plan B’s can reduce stress and make you more secure in certain situations. So if we had a plan B for life then would life itself become less stressful? And no I don’t mean killing yourself — geez. The purpose of life for an animal (which we are), is to create a copy of itself so the species continues. The word “purpose” is probably not the right word. You don’t have a “purpose” as such, but basically we only exist because every ancestor before us reproduced — so any creature that survives this far is very, very good at reproducing — it’s in your genes, so to speak. Therefore our brain silently guides us towards doing this. It makes us afraid or nervous or insecure in certain situations. It makes us feel great in other situations. But the overarching reason behind these emotions is the same — keep the body alive — make it attractive to the opposite sex — get it to reproduce — make sure the offspring survives. Therefore, plan A, from the point of view of life itself, is to stay alive and reproduce. If something threatens that — the brain will make you freak out. If you make a joke in front of people and it backfires — the brain will punish you for putting yourself in a position to be kicked out of a tribe. This means fending for yourself, which means potential death, which means less chance of reproducing. Of course it’s going to punish you! But now we can have a plan B. Surviving with no friends is completely possible. We can have a great life even if everyone in our social group completely ditches us. Assuming you can still work for money — you can live in a nice place. You can travel the world fairly easily. You can try and build a business and get rich. You can have a bunch of pets as friends. You can move to near a sunny beach and surf every day. Plan B is there in this day and age. Perhaps even write it out very specifically — for some it might even be better than your current life. The point is, knowing plan B is there, gives you the same feeling as having a plan B in other situations, like knowing another job is there waiting for you. You feel more relaxed — in control. Confident. Yourself.",2017
Overcoming Depression Part 9,"After College, things began to unravel pretty quickly. I avoided getting a full time job by working as a counselor in a summer camp, but got fired halfway through the summer. I dated a girl that was about to go to the same college that I just graduated from. As the summer was winding down, and she was leaving, I felt really isolated. I got a job in NY City in a bank, but quickly found myself overwhelmed like I did back in junior high and high school. My parents couldnt forceme to go this time, and so I quit, and remained in bed. I quickly became DEPRESSED.",2017
An Open Letter To My Anxiety,"I’ll start by saying that Anxiety is very harmful. Not just for the person suffering from it, but for those surrounding them, too. It’s not something that should be overlooked, but it tends to be a largely internal struggle. Because of this, the sufferer often can't talk about it with others. Consequently, many of the people around them, their would-be support network, have no idea what they’re dealing with. They can’t understand the effects if they’re not anxious themselves. If you’re anxious, you often overthink people’s perception of you, and that makes it hard to talk to them. However because the condition is largely invisible, the person you’re trying to talk to likely doesn’t see you as anything but completely normal. I like to think of my Anxiety as a metaphorical, slightly menacing black Dog that follows me everywhere. It’s occasionally not there, but I’m always worried about it coming back. That’s what it feels like. Near permanent, irrational panic. In late 2016 I finally decided that enough was enough. Dozens of coping mechanisms aside, I chose to finally start taking pills. Many factors were involved in my decision, the main ones being that I didn’t want to hinder my career as a Software Engineer, or my loving long-term relationship. Although it’s only been a short while, the pills have helped me see my condition as though I’m observing it from outside. I now know that the little things I do and think when I’m anxious are irrational, so I’m able to talk myself out of the inevitable despair that follows. However I’m not there yet. I still do and think those little things, but one by one I’m working on beating them. I hope that by my writing this post, effectively ""airing my dirty laundry"" if you will, readers out there will recognise these behaviours in somebody they know, and offer their support. Honestly, having people around me know what’s going on has helped immeasurably. These are a few of the things I do, that I hate. It often happens that I get invited places by my friends. This may be to a bar, a club, an event… you get the picture. Sometimes I accept, and actually go. Other times, I accept and psych myself up for days prior, but come the morning of or a few hours before, I’ll completely freak out. I can’t help it, but suddenly it’s the worst thing I can possibly imagine. Anxiety takes up all the available space in my brain, and in an instant all the energy and motivation I have for going out or doing anything at all evaporates. Of course I’m aware of what’s happening, but my brain tells me I’ll just dampen the mood and be a burden. So I’ll cancel. This is despite the fact I really want to go. I’ll subsequently spend hours or days in bed overcome with depression, which only makes everything worse. I call these hate spirals. I’ll eventually climb out of bed, but I’ll stew over it and hate everything and everyone including myself for days afterward. If I ever get invited anywhere while I'm having an anxious moment, I’ll just reject the invitation even though I may want to go. I’ll say I’m busy. I think that's better than responding; ""Sorry, but I’m currently overthinking things and hating myself while trying to crawl out of a hate spiral. Can I take a rain check?"" I don’t walk around wearing a yellow vest with the word ANXIOUS on it, though perhaps I should. So you can imagine just how many invitations I reject and how many plans I bail on. 😞 I hate this part the most. A simple word, or an ever-so-slightly cock-eyed glance from somebody can set my head processing and rewinding the situation for hours or days. But the truth is, we overthink everything. Whatever it is we happen to be obsessing over could've happened the other day, or a week ago... sometimes longer. I'll often obsess over conversations I've had with people. I should've said this, I shouldn't have said that. Why did they say that, and in that tone? It's both good and bad. I've learnt to thoroughly prepare for many possible outcomes of a conversation so the results, good or bad, don't affect me as much anymore. The bad part is that it's extremely draining. Even though this problem has all but gone away entirely 🎉, it sometimes inconveniently happens as I go to bed. I'll be super tired, but the moment I hit the pillow, my brain will give me a little prod and be all ""Hey, remember that time when you were 6, and you did that thing and your teacher/Mum/Dad/random got really mad?"" Ugh. If I’ve had a shitty night sleep, the next day I barely have a handle on my anxiety. The tiniest thing can set me off, so it’s generally a pretty bad day. Humans aren't perfect. Everybody makes mistakes. That was the mantra I muttered whenever I found myself obsessing over something I fucked up. It could've been anything. I could've got someone's name wrong, or forgotten to do something and I would obsess over it. It was the worst if I messed up at work. The thoughts that would arrive in my head were tremendously difficult to beat away. Of course I knew that the thoughts were irrational. I knew that everybody made mistakes and I wasn't perfect either. But my anxiety decided to tell me that I was the only being in a trillion light-year radius that ever made any and that I was hopeless. It sucked. Whenever this happened I would be in a thunderous mood. I would do my best to contain it, but there would be times it would colour what I said and it could be taken the wrong way. That was perhaps the biggest catalyst behind me deciding to take medication so as to prevent my condition from affecting my professional life. I love talking to people, and as introverted as a lot of Software Engineers are, we need to talk to a lot of them. I needed to accept making mistakes. But it’s still hard. I still post-mortem the occasional mistake, and think about “what I should’ve done.” But it’s getting better. Onward and upward! As much as I love sleeping, when I’m overcome with depression from an anxiety attack I can’t get out of bed or stop sleeping. I hate that. Though the apathy toward doing anything whatsoever is the worst part. Why? I have things to do like every person. I need to do ironing, washing and cleaning. I need to run the dishwasher and walk the Dog. I need to go to the supermarket. When I’m unable to get out of bed due to anxiety/depression, I list all the things I need to/want to do in my head. As the list gets longer, I get more and more overwhelmed. As a consequence, the entire list of tasks as well as essential things like showering and wearing deodorant, become afterthoughts. Forget the housework. That just piles up. The tasks? Overdue. Have to pick up a parcel? Get a call from the post office saying they’ll return it to sender. Ugh. This was all a good while ago. The medication, work, and having people around me who understand has helped me get a handle on these parts of my condition. When it happens, I can tell people that I “just need a moment.” I can curl up with my partner and watch a cheesy movie and eat take away. I can vanish into the tea room at work and make myself a stiff cup of Tea. I can go home to the Dog anddisconnect from everything in the world ever. Everything helps, now that I’m finally able to see it. The bottom of the line is, you need to have people around you who are aware. They need to know. It’ll help you. I solemnly promise. As I mentioned before, I personally still have a ways to go. This was hard to write about, but I believe it’ll help others. That’s the important part. ❤️ So I’ll leave this here, or I’ll go on forever. I mean I will go on forever, because if you know me, you know I don’t shut up. 😂 Fin.",2017
PHOBIAS AND SOCIAL LIFE:,"Phobia: the word is derived from the name of the Greek god of terror, Phobos. Phobias are conditions rooted deep in the psyche, compelling a person to fear beyond reason. That’s the key: phobias are beyond reasonable and don’t easily respond to logic or discussion. Phobias can be crippling — but are fortunately often responsive to a combination of counseling and anti-anxiety medications. · Phobias can be really difficult for children or teens, especially when friends and family don’t understand why your child is getting so upset. Also, while an adult or teen might realize that their fear is unreasonable or excessive, a younger child might not be aware of this. Phobias are constant, excessive fears of an object or situation that interfere with one’s life and/or cause personal distress. Phobias are among the most common types of psychiatric disorders, with 11% of the population subject to a phobia at some point in their lives, and 5.5% of the population subject to a phobia within a given 30-day period. Many people learn to manage their phobia with minimal difficulties. For example, a person with a spider phobia might avoid activities such as camping but otherwise, does not notice a disruption in his or her life. However, for phobias that cause noticeable life interference, there are effective treatments that are successful in up to 90% of cases. Women are almost twice as likely to struggle with a specific phobia, but the sexes are equally afflicted by social phobia. Typically, both disorders begin in childhood, although specific phobias can also start in a person’s mid twentieth Many of us have fears about particular objects or situations, and this is perfectly normal. A fear becomes a phobia if it lasts for more than six months, and has a significant impact on how you live your day-to-day life. It stops me living my life. “Things that other people do without thought become huge ordeals for me.” Phobias are typically grouped into one of five categories: 1. Animal Type (fears of spiders, snakes, cats, dogs, mice, birds, or other animals) 2. Natural Environment Type (fears of being near water, storms, and high places) 3. Blood-Injection-Injury Type (fears of seeing blood, medical procedures, and injuries, receiving injections, and having blood drawn) 4. Situational Type (fears of driving, flying, and being in enclosed spaces) 5. Other Type (fears of vomiting, choking, loud sounds and other fears not belonging to any of the other categories) Research suggests that phobias can run in families and that both genetic and environmental factors (nature and nurture) can contribute to developing a phobia. Some children and teens develop a phobia after being exposed to a traumatic or frightening event. More often than not, however, people report that they have had the phobia as long as they can remember, or that they were always fearful of an object or situation and that it gradually developed into a phobia. For example, a child can develop a fear of water after nearly drowning. Other times, children can develop a phobia after receiving scary information about something, or be instructed to stay away from an object or situation. This is often done inadvertently, but not always. For example, some children may develop a phobia of an animal after a trusted adult repeatedly warns them the animal is dangerous and might bite them. Finally, a child may develop a phobia by observing others’ anxious response to objects or situations. For example, a child may develop a spider phobia after watching an older sibling scream and run when in contact with a spider. Most psychologists believe that a combination of factors explains why phobias develop, including biological vulnerability, such as the tendency to be startled or alarmed, traumatic experiences with feared objects or situations, observations of others reacting fearfully to certain objects or situations, and learning information about the danger of certain objects and situations. These circumstances, in turn, make it likely that phobic individuals will develop problematic ideas about the feared object or situation, such as the amount of danger it poses, the frequency with which they will encounter it, and their ability to cope with it. Interestingly, people are more likely to develop phobias of insects and storms rather than guns or knives. Many researchers believe things like insects and storms posed a threat to our ancestors, and it helped them to survive if they had a moderate level of fear toward them. Symptoms of a phobia include: feeling unsteady, dizzy, lightheaded or faint, feeling like you are choking a pounding heart, palpitations or accelerated heart rate, chest pain or tightness in the chest, sweating, hot or cold flushes, shortness of breath or a smothering sensation, nausea, vomiting or diarrhea, numbness or tingling sensations, trembling or shaking Life-Limiting — One of the main criteria for diagnosing a phobia is that it is life-limiting in nature. Depending on what your phobia is, you might find it a real struggle to run errands, go out with friends or even make it work every day. Isolation — Limitations associated with phobias can make you feel isolated. You may wonder why you are not like everybody else. You may have trouble keeping friends. You may become reclusive and depressed. Embarrassing — Phobias can cause awkward and embarrassing situations. How do you explain to your best friend that you can never visit her home because she owns a dog? How do you turn down a trip to the Bahamas with a new love because you can’t bring yourself to get on a plane? Social phobia can be especially difficult to manage because the underlying fear is of humiliation. Having a phobic reaction can feel humiliating, reinforcing the fear and making the phobia more difficult to manage. Feeling out of Control — Perhaps one of the worst emotional components of a phobia is the out of control feeling. You probably understand that your phobia is irrational, but no matter how hard you try you can’t get it under control. You wonder what it would be like to simply live your life without worrying that you may come into contact with that which you dread. Helplessness may appear when you realize that your phobia is out of control. You may feel that there is nothing you can do to heal. You may assume that you will always have your phobia. You may wish things were different, but feel that they never will be. At times, phobias can cause disagreements in close relationships, as they can limit the activities that partners and families can do together. Families of children with phobias often create time-consuming rituals to structure the phobic child’s environment so that the child either successfully learns to deal with the phobia, or so that the family can avoid a “scene” caused by the phobia. Partners and family members often find themselves trying to strike an unstable balance between showing love and concern toward the phobic individuals and encouraging them to overcome their fears. It very eases for those who don’t suffer from a severe phobia to underestimate how overwhelming and complete the experience can be, and how many ways it can impinge on life. Perhaps it can be clarified by considering the case of a simple and common phobia: Phobia, the fear of bees. A person with a severe phobia can respond with intense panic when they even suspect the presence of bees. Panic can be triggered by a fly, a bit of blown chaff, or a faint buzzing noise. If a sufferer is unprepared and a sound or movement occurs and is mistaken for a bee, panic can occur before the sufferer has time to realize his or her mind misinterpreted a signal. A moment of inattention and a buzzing fly can lead to a panic attack. For those with agoraphobia, the fear of public spaces, just stepping out the front door can start the fear. Obviously, fears this intense and easily triggered can become major burdens, coloring life on all levels. If you or someone you know suffers from a severe phobia, life can become an endless round of defensive actions made to prevent an encounter with whatever serves as the focus of fear. Even lesser phobias can be a burden. A moderate fear of public speaking can be downright disastrous for an executive rising in the ranks of many professions. A person with even a moderate case of claustrophobia, the fear of being enclosed, can find themselves suffering stress and dismay every time they go up an elevator or standing in a packed line at a bank. While many can live with their phobias without ever being severely inconvenienced, many others are constantly affected by their fear. Phobia can lead to serious discrepancy among family members as it causes hindrance in interpersonal relationships. Often a phobic individual cannot match himself with the rest of the family and here lies the root of all commotion. Families having children suffering from phobia find it quite difficult to cope up with the situation. Either the members of the family have to create circumstances that will help the small one combat conditions of fear, or they have to work together to avoid conditions of acute fear and anxiety. Love, compassion, and friendliness — these are the three doses of medicine that can best cure a condition of intense fear or phobia. · After you have dealt with the question how a phobia affects your family, you must find out which phobic type causes problems in most relationships. It is a social phobia, which plays the role of a villain in social life. A victim of social phobia feels uneasy to mix with people, especially with those who are absolutely unknown and unfamiliar. This causes problems for the rest of the family, as they feel embarrassed when asked about the absence of the phobic individual. Moreover, the family also feels quite uncomfortable and distressed when the members see that the phobic individual is unable to share his problems with others. This is the most common issue among growing adolescents and their parents. In most cases, the guardians fail to understand the needs of their child. This causes a difference of opinion between both the generations and the teen feels depressed about not being able to express properly. Also, people are less involved in the management of their fear, they just try to avoid the feeling and situations. Most importantly, it was seen that our culture is helpful in supporting the fear and its management.",2017
Six Tips for Coping with Anxiety that are Actually Easy to Change,"Here are six suggestions to change those everyday ways of being: · Slow down! You may find yourself moving more quickly than is necessary. Slow your pace and everything will get done but you will be calmer. Drive slower, walk slower, talk slower, answer phone calls and texts slower. It all helps a great deal. · Take a fifteen minute “power stress relief time.” This just involves sitting down or lying down and doing nothing but attending to your heart beat. If it is racing, take slow deep breaths and empty your mind of anything that worries you or is on your schedule. · Have a cup of decaffeinated (very important) tea that is soothing. · If it’s a nice day, go out and let yourself feel the sun’s rays for a few minutes. The warmth is comforting. · If you’re a loner that’s fine, but not so great for anxiety. Put on some easy listening music with head phones and zone out for a while. · If you’re more gregarious call that friend who is a calm inducer and either chat about random stuff or share your worry. Whatever works for you. The connection and feeling understood can do wonders. If you notice that these changes are actually working for you, it’s easy to let them slip and slide away from you and you’re back feeling anxious. It’s important to keep these coping skills uppermost in your mind every day until they become your new norm. You may become aware that people around you are noticing you are a more relaxed person. You may find that even though you’re moving slower, you’re more productive because your focus and concentration have increased. Be sure to give yourself credit for your improvements in your well-being. There’s nothing wrong with lots of pats on the back for making changes that had been habitual. This is no easy road. It’s a slow but steady journey to give you a healthier happier life style.

5 Things Someone With Health Anxiety Worries About a Stomach Bug,"Or, whose mind is it anyway? This particular devil has descended upon our house. So far it has only hit my wife, but just the fact that it is withing these four walls is enough to start my health anxiety rising. 1. No Touch Policy This is one of the first things that goes into action when a bug hits the household. There is an immediate no touch policy and this doesn’t just affect the person. I also enforce no touch of any part of the bathroom, bed or any possible surface that may have been touched. This can be quite a large area, but my super alert mind can remember the exact location of every place my wife has touched. 2. Quarantine Of course, there is an immediate quarantine area that anyone not affected must not enter. This area usually includes the bedroom, bathroom and the hallway in between. It means I spend the contagious days in the spare room wearing a gas mask and chanting against evil spirits. I also anoint myself with hand gel. 3. Decontamination The level that this goes to is only limited by what I can get away with. In an ideal world, every plate, glass, bedding, clothing and bathroom visited by the ill person would be placed into a sealed container and dropped into the nearest active volcano. What actually happens is the clothes and bedding go on a boil wash (there is no volcano setting on our washing machine). The plates and glasses go on an extra long dishwasher setting, and anything eaten by the person 24 hours before is tested and analysed. 4. The Mind Goes into Overdrive All of a sudden, I become not only a leading forensic detective, but I also develop an amazing sense of self-preservation. I liken it to the 70’s show Joe 90, it’s as if I put on glasses and I suddenly know the incubation period of any bug ever discovered. I also overthink any possible contamination or infection. I worry for the whole period of quarantine as well as a good three days after. 5. Guilt This is a big part for me because I feel very guilty for these feelings and coping strategies. I know that my wife understands, but I feel as though I should be helping. I do all the housework and looking after Bea of course, but It still feels like it’s not enough. I have actually been very good for writing this as I usually can’t type or mention that which can’t be mentioned (no, not Voldemort).",2017
Why Medium?,"New name, new place. The Anxious Gamers is officially gone, it was time to renew the domain and the hosting and it just felt like a change was needed. I don’t feel the connection to gaming that I once did. It has been chipped away over time and I really couldn’t be bothered sharing thoughts about things that nobody really wants to talk about anyway. Gaming was a very useful tool for me when I first got ill, as I became sicker and as I started to get better. Now my time and focus needs to be on other things. Distraction is a fine thing when there is no clear route to improvement but I am aware now what I need to do to get better. I need to walk, I need to train and repair my body to overcome all the injuries that it has sustained. I need to eat right, sleep right, live right. The next year and a half is an exercise in determination, discipline and routine. Worrying about new releases and trying to find games that might in some way cover mental health issues is a thing of the past. As such, the scope of my writing will become broader, anything that touches on mental health can show up here. My own experiences, others, research I feel is important, media I feel is doing a good thing. Whatever I want. For 2017 and I give myself the gift of freedom, try it out. The reason I went with Medium is quite simple, it is a site designed to do all the things I need it to do without me having to do them. I am tired a lot from working on getting better, simplifying the process and removing worry is always a good thing. Medium also has an inbuilt audience, write well and write often and the audience is there and from what I can tell they are eager to read. Thanks to all who have supported me thus far, I probably wouldn’t be as far along the road towards getting better as I am without you. Time for a change now though, time to take the next step with this writing in the hope of helping others take the next step with there own journey.",2017

How constipation changed my life.,"How my daughters constipation changed my life. About a 7 months ago my daughter and I were spending the day selling products at a local fair, when she wasn't feeling well. That led to three days of constipation and then after I was giving her suppositories, and still nothing…. I decided to take her to the doctors. Her abdomen was a little swollen, but really I thought it was that she just hadn’t gone in like 5 days. Both of my girls are very active and although not sticks, they do not usually bloat up you can tell when they are swollen. In the mean time I had looked up possible causes of stomach pains; although he symptoms were not exactly like appendicitis I thought maybe. After her throwing up, I decided to take her to the doctor, who examined her, and wrote down two things on a note and sent us to the hospital with strict instructions not to put up with waiting in emerg forever and give the note to a doctor who examines her, not to the admitting nurse. While at our doctor she had a mild fever, the only other thing is that I kind of complained about was that the hospital in our town (a suburb of Toronto) is always busy and takes forever to get seen, she did not want us going to one of the surrounding smaller hospitals because they would just send us right back to our hospital and or she did not want us stuck in traffic in case it was appendicitis. By the time we get to our hospital, and the she was triaged the nurse claimed that she did not have a temperature, and would be seen accordingly. SIGH. AFTER 4 hours, of waiting with one daughter in pain and the other one bored out of her skull, and a little creeped out by some of the other patients, we got to see a doctor, who read the note from our doctor, examined her and promptly sent us for an ultrasound. That happened quickly, the ultrasound itself was about an hour in length, and my comment to the tech was “when does it stop looking like you are looking at a baby or alien inside?” She laughed kind of awkwardly, little did I know. When she went to discuss the info with the radiologist, I called my good friend who is a diagnostic imaging specialist, I was telling her what was on the screen, and how long the tech had been gone. Her comments to me were, “Em, this isn't good, and it isn't right, I have never seen or heard of what you are telling me.” Hmmm that was odd, she then said, “what will happen is they will send us back to the doctor, and probably have a ct scan.” That is exactly what happened. In that time period, my husband had come, and eventually my Mom came to pick up our youngest girl, who after many hours at the hospital was quite restless. I may have had a small blow up at the nurses who were all standing around and seemingly doing nothing. Daughter number 1 was still in a lot of pain, and was finally given Tylenol her “non existent” fever, and then into the next area for her scan. Not a lot of waiting was needed here, just she had to drink a lot, which when you feel sick, is not easy to do. By the way, it is now about midnight, and we had arrived at the hospital at 4. Once the scan was complete, it only took about 30 mins, we were back in the waiting room. FINALLY they called us back in with the doctor, who now had another doctor with him, and we were told “well she does not have appendicitis, she has a tumor”. We literally just stood there, I looked at my husband, then at her, we all just were like, what??? Huh? How can a girl who is an active dancer, who has been camping all summer, just get a tumor, that is 16+ cm’s in length? with that news, they offered her some strong pain meds, and were sending us to Sick Kids Hospital in the city. She and I went in an ambulance, and my husband followed in our own vehicle, it was now 3 in the morning. When we arrived it was pretty easy to get into a room, in the emerg here, every room is private and we were seen very promptly, her pain was managed and we were exhausted, trying to catch a few Zzz’s between every new doctor. By 10 am we were admitted to the 5th floor, and her pain was being taken very seriously, her fever was being managed, I think we got a bit of sleep. The next major thing we had as a MRI in the early evening. The MRI confirmed what the CT scan had shown, that there was a large tumour, now measuring almost 18 cm’s in length, 12 cm’s in width and 10 cm’s deep. The priority was to get her to poop, and bring the fever down. By Friday morning, she had done both. So at that point, after meeting with so many different doctors, we were given the clear to go home. Our daughter was a priority, and surgery would happen next week, there seemed to be a bit of a disagreement between two departments, Oncology and Gyno; as this tumour presented as a germ cell tumour originating from her right ovary, and even though she was only 13, ovarian cancer is more of an adult issue so we may be sent to the cancer hospital across the road, as they have specialists in this area, but that was not guaranteed. We were able to go home for the weekend, and would be contacted Monday with further information. With so much family and friends wanting to show their support, we decided to have an open house on the Sunday. Her friends came, our friends, our family, needless to say I spent Saturday and Sunday cleaning. So much love and affection. Well we went back to the “Adult” hospital on Tuesday, met with a gynaecologist, who assured me that preserving her fertility was of the utmost importance (that thought had NEVER occurred to me) and they would remove the tumour, which my daughter had now named “Homer”; we would probably have a round of chemo after that, and there was very little to worry about. A series of hectic and confusing things happened in the following week (10 days to be exact), ranging from us being down at 3 different hospitals in 1 day, to having 2 different surgery times (at 2 hospitals). Regardless, the day came when after all of the pre-op work, she was to have surgery. The surgery itself lasted a few hours, my husband, her father, had to be out of town at a meeting, which was fine as there is very little point sitting and waiting around. Funny enough, while in the waiting room, I met a friend whom I had lost contact with many years ago, he was there for a surgery with his father. We chatted, it passed the time. Then her doctor came to speak with me. Not only did they remove the tumour, which in 10 days since the MRI had grown over 10 cm’s and was now measuring 25–30 cm’s, they removed 500 cc’s of fluid from her abdomen. This was a little puzzling to her surgeons, as the type of tumour they thought it was, should not have presented with fluid — but not to worry, everything had been sent to pathology and we would find out the results soon enough. Now we had to concentrate on her abdomen healing. She would be in the recovery room shortly, and they would come get me. In the recovery room, she was still asleep when I arrived, and within a few minutes my parents arrived. She woke up to the three of us watching and loving her. As she was in and out of consciousness, I managed to film her chatting about a “little girl” that came to play with her while she was sleeping. It was eerie but nice. Now the week goes on, on her first day out of surgery, she was not doing the greatest, and needed a blood transfusion, she was SO pale and lethargic. Once the new blood took effect, she began to heal pretty quick. As this was an Adult hospital, and a teaching hospital, when they came to do rounds, she was “put on display” it felt. For the most part, I sat back and quietly listened to the physicians. I intervened once, when it was a group of physicians and without regard for her only being 13, pulled the sheets down to inspect the incision, however, given where the base of the wound was, I jumped up pretty quick to cover her up, and managed to point to the female… one of the lead doctors, realised where I was going, even though I could not manage to speak coherently and asked her to take over, and perhaps be a little more discreet. All I know is that I wanted to hug my girl and kick that doc right out. Once she was up and walking, she healed fast and without any complications. On our last day, we were told that we had to go back to Sick Kids, and meet with our team there. We assumed (I know I know) that it was for a follow up and some information on the next steps. Of course there was confusion. We found where we were supposed to go, The Sears Cancer Clinic, they had us on file, but no appointment was actually scheduled. The intake receptionist told us to have a seat, registered her, and we waited until they figured out who we were waiting to see. (The name of the doctor that we were given, well there were two doctors with that name, one we had seen previously (she was the one that sent us to the specialist at Princess Margaret), she was off on Friday’s and the other one was on holidays. As my husband and I bickered as to where we were supposed to be, a nurse came and reassured us that we were in the right spot, it was just a last minute appointment so unfortunately there was a bit of confusion, but we would be seen shortly. As we waited, my daughter noticed that her intake bracelet had LEUKAEMIA / LYMPHOMA on it written under the part where her name was. That was our sign. We were then taken to the Orange Pod, she was weighed, measured, and we were put in a room. In came a familiar face, at the time I could not remember her name, but we saw her when we were brought in the Emergency room and again the next day. As her demeanor is very quiet, and she has a slight accent, it was a bit hard to follow what was going on, but they were sending us for further testing, pathology was not back yet, but they suspected Lymphoma B cell, off to get an ultrasound, blood work and then come back. I happened to have a cousin that was working in that very hospital, in that ward, so he managed to track us down on the first floor Ultra sound clinic, chatted with us a bit, which helped ease the tension and fear that was accumulating. Once all of those tests were done, more waiting, and finally we met with a new doc, who very plainly explained to us, the severity of what our daughter was facing, and although the official report was not back yet, we needed to move quickly with chemo. We were told we would be in the hospital for minimum of four months, potentially six, as this was the middle of August, I asked about school, she was to start grade 8 in a few weeks!! He point blankly looked at us and said “Some things are more important than school”. Once again, it hit us, right smack dab in our face. They went through why they suspected Lymphoma, and they were just awaiting the final report. When that was sent to them, they would bring us in for intensive treatment immediately. That was Friday; on Tuesday we got the call to come back in, bring a bag just in case. Tuesday morning, 6 am we were on the road, got to the hospital, went back up to the 8th floor, registered, and waited, only to be redirected to the day surgery oncology clinic, for a Lumbar Puncture. (HUH?) After a day of tests and running around, we were sent home and told to come back Friday morning. (Friday of the Labour day weekend) On Friday morning, early again, we were sent for another LP, all we knew was that this was now her second LP, thinking that the tests were inconclusive or somehow botched fear was setting in again. When we met with the nurse, we found out, that no it was not another test, she was starting chemo. HUH??? We did not even know that it was in fact Non Hodgkin's Lymphoma; did we? Regardless, they did their procedure and we were taken to a room to wait for the team to come talk to us. (I feel like I keep using the same pronouns) When the doctors came it was our familiar face, Jahleela, and a new face, Dr. Naqvi, who was the head of the department. Although ideally they would have liked to do this part before she had her LP, time would not allow it, regardless, all suspicions were confirmed, our 13 year old athletic dancer had Non Hodgkin’s Lymphoma, Burkitt’s and was being admitted at the to start her treatment and we were taken to what would be our room for a month. In all of this, she had not broken down, I do not even think that she cried. She just took it all in. I was freaking out, but not wanting to put that on display for her. It was now all factual and we were quickly figuring things out. There was a plan and as the tumour was successfully and completely removed, we were lucky. I stayed at the hospital during the week with her, my husband at home with our other daughter. this was the first time in 10 years I was not home for the first day of school, wait … neither was she!!! Every year, we take a picture of the girls in front of our red maple tree; my husband took the picture, but had Jordan hold up her Surface, and we Skype’d in. It was the best we could do. The time actually past quickly, we met with all kinds of specialists, she had a whole team helping. BY the way, WHEN YOU MEET with the Pharmacy team, although you are TRYING to understand, you really do not. Chemo went okay, mild nausea, no real hair loss yet, she signed up for in room yoga and she was assigned a teacher who would come work with her once a day for 45 minutes. On weekends I went home to spend time with Jordan did a day trip to Niagara, tried to keep us occupied and not thinking about IT. Sunday’s we spent the afternoon in the hospital, trying to have some natural sister / family bonding time. Friends came to visit, family was unending… Within a week she had her CVL put in, (central line, so her chemo and blood work could all be done through that as opposed to having a constant IV hookup). September was a crazy whirlwind, yet at the time it felt like time was standing still. I was fortunate to meet some of the other parents and kids, but overall we did not really leave the room all that much, most of the time she was hooked up to meds on her IV pole, which she lovingly named Jeffery. At the end of the month, we were POTENTIALLY able to go home for two days. I was very apprehensive of this. Well, as it happened, she was not able to go home home, but we were given a “day” pass. So we decided to try to go to the Eaton Centre, it was HOT out. We made it roughly 3 blocks before she had to sit, in the middle of a store, she went in, and sat. I WAS mortified, yet also knew that she couldn’t go any further, we had to go back. That was that. She had now successfully completed one full round of chemo (COPADAM1). I am going to stop this here for now. There is much more to write, but I need to stop for now. (maybe an hour, maybe a week!! It has taken me a while just to get this all down, I actually started in October when we were still going through it all) ROUND 2. Her first CHEMO fever. We were told that this round was similar to the last, but there may be some changes in her reactions (which is why we were in patient). Well, I don’t remember what day of the treatment it happened, but if I had to guess I would say day 3? She had been “flirting” with a fever and feeling sluggish most of the day, her day nurse and her night nurse were on top of it. The thing that they cannot do, is do anything to HIDE the fever, it has to come. For most of the night we were watching TV, the new fall lineup. At about midnight, I went to tuck her in, and she was not just warm, she was ON FIRE. I took her temperature, sure enough it was above 38. I paged the nurse, who came lickety split, confirmed the fever, and called the rest of the team, Phlebotomy, the on call physician, the charge nurse and I am sure more. Within 30 mins, she was looked at, treated, blood drawn, other samples given and left to sleep. It was quite remarkable how quickly it all happened. The next morning, more tests, the morning rounds were full of new plans and medications to be tried and meetings with the nutritionist. Within 24 to 36 hours she was feeling much better and her fever was gone. The reso of October flew by, she was in “isolation” for a good chunk due to a cold (which is a danger to other kids on chemo), although on Halloween she was able to show off her costume which we made. (Charlie Brown)… it was a hit! More chemo, more tests. One Thursday night, while my friend was visiting, we got notice that we would be changing rooms, in fact floors, as her condition was stable and although she would be starting a new round, there were others that needed our room. We were moving from the 8th floor to the 6th floor, where the care would be pretty much the same, just less nurses per patient. I was very annoyed, having to pack up our space, and then waiting, and waiting for it to actually happen (we were told at about 7:30 pm, and were not moved until about 10:30 / 11 pm). An inconvenience, but I guess for a good reason. Well, as this was now her 3rd large round of heavy dose chemo, and the protocol had changed, new meds introduced, she was once again “flirting” with a fever all of Friday. I went home and my husband came to be with her for the weekend. Friday night he let me know that yes a full fever had come, and once again blood work taken and so on. Saturday morning. I get a call from him. I needed to get there, I wanted to be there ASAP. UMMMM … what the …. I took Jordan to my parents and SPED downtown. I think I made it within 40 minutes, which is pretty quick seeing as when he called me I was still in bed. Now this was the hardest part. She was DELIRIOUS. She had a horrible night, could not control her bowels, did not make it to the toilet on time and it was NOT a pleasant experience (all over the floor — green explosion), she did not know who anyone was, with the exception of me, when she was awake, she was hysterical. That particular type of chemo was stopped. (Cytarabine) As she had a fever for so long, and the state of general confusion she was in, the doctors ordered a MRI on her brain, to check for any brain damage. That was HORRIFYING. Not just the actual procedure, which was horrible, I can’t even think of another word to describe it. Getting her to the MRI was one thing, getting her on the bed, strapped in so she could go in the MRI machine. She was CRYING, SCREAMING, BEGGING to get out. BEGGING to stop. I was there, trying to calm her, holding down her legs. Nothing was working. After 45 minutes, the MRI technician stopped and said that there is no way this is going to work she could not lie still to get any images, we would have to wait until we could have an anaesthesiologist and re do the whole thing. REALLY???? uggg. For that by the way, as it was the weekend, and now almost evening, was not going to happen any time quickly. Back up to our room we went, waiting, lots of specialists. Oh, while we were down trying to have the MRI, we were moved back up to the 8th floor. She had started to become a bit more cognisant of everything. Her memory was still foggy, watching my husband wince when she couldn’t remember him other than than his first name. When asked about Jordan, she said that she was her step sister (which is not true), she was quite animate that she could play the guitar and was frustrated that her father did not let her at that moment. Random things like that. She wasn’t eating or drinking, even when we pleaded with her. Eventually down for her MRI we went, she was a bit more calm, as she likes the feeling of going under sedation, just a little throwing up. It was a LONG 72 hours. All chemo had stopped, we were now waiting for her to come back to “normal”. We had to stay in the hospital for the full week, she had a CT scan on her abdomen to check if her tumour had redeveloped at all and to check her overall progression, and by the next Friday we were able to come home for a few days, while her team figured out what the next steps were. (Once again, I will pause here)… more to come.",2017
7 steps to keep the wolves at bay.,"I rarely feel anxiety anymore, at least not to the level that it affects my day-to-day life. I stress the word “anymore,” because for much of my life, my stomach was in a knot. As a sophomore in high school, I threw up almost daily. It wasn’t because I was physically sick. It was because my stress outpaced my coping mechanisms. Picture it, Texas, 1991. No cell phones, no Internet, no email. No car, so still riding the big yellow dog to school each day. AC in the house breaks every year, like clockwork. No iPod. No such thing as an mp3, even…just good old Columbia House and a tape deck or CD player. A grand total of 5 channels on the TV, the changing of which required getting up to either turn the knob, or in some cases, turn the antenna outside. Playing the same Super Mario Brothers and Metroid over and over and over. If you gave me the chance to live that life now, but with the perspective I have today, I’d view it as heaven on earth. But at 15, you’ve got maybe 10 years of conscious memories and trial and error under your belt. And for me, the stress of life started mounting faster than my 10 years of figuring it all out could handle. And that manifested itself in the form of barf. Relationships, grades, religious expectations and fears, parents’ expectations, increasing competition and expectations in music, teachers’ expectations, friends’ expectations…they were all coming at me at an incredible rate. As I learned lessons and didn’t die from my mishaps, I started to handle the growing expectations pretty well. And the expectations grew, as well. College is harder than high school, namely because you’re doing all of that same stuff except you’re hung over all the time. So basically, I was still puking, just for different reasons. The anxiety didn’t really go away, though. It just started manifesting itself in different ways. Depression. Ruminating. Being a workaholic. “Turning my brain off” through different (albeit always legal, in case the FBI reads this) means of escape. I figured a lot out in the last few years (read more about it here or here or here). I’m immensely grateful through each of my lessons, I stumbled forward instead of into prison or a grave. The good news: I’ve been in a consistently healthy frame of mind for a few years now. I’m always in the process of self-evaluation and reflection — but to be fair, that was true even when I was depressed and anxious. I learned that your mental state is like a pair of tinted glasses. If you’re wearing yellow lenses, everything takes on a yellow tone. If they’re blue, everything’s kind of blue. Reality doesn’t change, but your perception of reality is channeled through a filter. Changing the filter through which you view life makes all the difference. The main difference between my self-evaluation back then versus now is simple. In the past, it was self-focused negative self-talk and rumination. Now it is much more likely to be substantive, workable intelligence that I can apply to future problems. I want to share a bit of that substantive, workable intel that I got over the years. I have seven statements that, the truer I make each one through my efforts, the more my lenses become clear (or maybe even rose-colored). 1. I evaluate “what’s the worst that could happen.” Whenever I am faced with a dicey situation, the first question I try to ask myself is (a) what is the worst that could happen here, (b) would I be able to survive that possibility, should it come to fruition, and © could any good come of that worst-case? What I find is that a lot of anxiety, for me anyway, is the spiraling thoughts of what could happen. That spiral can be so rapid and chaotic that it blurs the reality of the situation, and you get stuck clinching your eyes shut and praying for the ride to hurry up and end. Recently, I was worried about a situation at work. I asked myself, what’s honestly the worst that could happen? Well, I guess I could get fired, which would put me in a rough financial spot. I’d be losing a year’s worth of work toward a goal. And I’d need to find a new job pretty quickly. Would I be able to survive that? Yes, of course. I’ve lost jobs unexpectedly before. It sucks, but it’s survivable for sure. Could any good come of it? Sure! Being unemployed opens up a lot of time to work out and read, and if I got fired over this issue, I’d be happy to move onto a more forward-looking and strategic company anyway. Realizing all of that doesn’t make me want to lose my job, but once I honestly internalize the truth that the absolute worst that can happen is survivable AND comes with a few good results, my anxiety level goes down tremendously. It’s like I’ve taken a roll of the dice where I might win or lose, and turned it into a situation where I might win a little or I might win a lot. Did reality change? Nope. Just wearing different glasses. 2. I live in an intentional state of optimism and positivity. I’ve written plenty about this — I’m not even going to make a link, just read my stuff if you want to understand this point better. Suffice it to say, your brain can’t tell the difference between “feeling happy so you in turn act like a happy person,” or “acting like a happy person so you then feel happy.” It works. 3. I am medicated. Okay, so it’s vulnerability time. I’ve been on antidepressants off and on for many years. I’ve found that when I’m on them, and stay on them, my ability to self-evaluate and course-correct is 100x better than when I’m not. I was on them for a few years but still struggling a bit, and a wise doctor suggested that there might be more going on than pure “depression.” She added in a different drug, and that did the trick. I’ve felt steady, calm, unruffled, and stable for almost a year now. Like 100%. Not just better, not just kind of sort of not miserable, but literally like a person is supposed to feel. Shit still happens to me that ruffles my feathers, I still have bad days, it’s not a panacea. It’s a set of special lenses for a dude who, as it turns out, sees everything in shades of gray and blue without them. Who knew?! Is that the answer for you? I have no idea. But if you are concerned that your best days are not as good as other people’s best days, see a doctor. If you are concerned that your bed isn’t just calling you, but it won’t let you up, see a doctor. If you can’t muster the strength to do things you need to do, see a doctor. Don’t be hard-headed. And here’s one other tip: if you’re suffering through this stuff, so are the people closest to you. It’s not fair to them for you to have a solvable problem, but refuse to solve it. 4. I have a dog. This one is probably my favorite. I love dogs. Always have. If you don’t love dogs, I’m suspicious of you. And if my dog doesn’t like you, the verdict is in: you suck. But seriously, life is significantly better with a dog. My little buddy unconditionally loves me. He gives me a reason to laugh every single day. He’s someone to take care of that genuinely needs me. I used to have two Boston terriers, and I lost them when my ex and I got divorced. I told my attorney that I wanted to fight the ex for custody of them. My attorney then summarily told me to pull my head out of my ass. That’s what’s great about a good attorney — they’re emotionally detached from your situation so when you’re not thinking straight, you can pay them to think straight for you. Lemmy is not a wolf, so I don’t keep him at bay. But those two dogs were my sons. I loved them so much, and it was really hard to lose them. And my life situation made it tough to take on some new dogs. That is, until last August, when we adopted Lemmy! He needed a good home, and we needed a good dog, so it was a perfect match. And there’s zero doubt that Lemmy makes my life better simply by existing. He’s a good boy. It’s just a universal truth: life is better with a dog, period. My instinct tells me that if one dog is great, than a farm full of dogs would be amazing. Sounds totally believable, and I fully intend to try it when I retire. I can’t see any problems with this plan. 5. I try to do at least one thing per day that I want to do. I got this advice a few years back when my work was overtaking my life. It seems simple, and it is, but it’s powerful. It’s taking the time to do one thing that isn’t for advancing your career, isn’t for your partner, isn’t for anything or anyone other than you and your gratification. It can be running, playing a video game, taking a hot bath, reading a book, going shopping, lifting weights, whatever works for you. The key is, this you remember to prioritize yourself and your own enjoyment of life. We all owe something to someone — you owe your best to your spouse or significant other, your children, your boss, and probably a few other people. It is very easy in the midst of your servitude to forget about your own needs, or to minimize or defer them. Two problems with that: one, you’ll slowly but surely resent the people you’re serving, and two, you’ll miss out on the greatest gift anyone’s ever had, the enjoyment of the now. If you really want to serve others well, serve yourself well. To paraphrase Stephen Covey and Abraham Lincoln…if you wear your own saw down to nubs, you’re not going to be able to cut down the tree (at least not without a ton of unnecessary effort). Sit your butt down every day and sharpen the saw. And without sounding too macabre…you never know when the tree’s gonna fall on you. It’d be a damn shame if you spent every waking minute deferring your own happiness, only to get squish like grape. 6. I work in a job where I get paid to be me. This took a long time to get to. I’ve done a lot of hard hours of physical, mental, and even emotional work doing things that I didn’t particularly enjoy over the years. I studied, I read, I took advice, I gave advice (some that worked, some that didn’t), I changed jobs a few times, I moved, I went back to school to learn more…and eventually, all of that came to a head. I finally landed in a job where “being me” is worth a pretty good living, where I’m never micromanaged, and where I’m able to knock it out of the park often enough to feel like an all-star. There’s a huge psychological boost to arriving at this point in my career. And I want to make this clear: I probably could have gotten here faster if I had focused on career satisfaction instead of career advancement. But I’m here now, and it certainly helps my mental state. If you aren’t there yet, my recommendation would be the sit down and map out exactly what “getting paid to be you” looks like. What do you love to do? What comes naturally to you? Are you working for money or are you getting paid to do what you would be doing anyway? What’s the path to get there? And, if that’s just not in the cards within your career in the short run, here’s an alternative: find something to do in your downtime that gets you rewarded for being you. Money isn’t the only way to keep score. Getting halfway there is better than deferring until you can get it 100% right. 7. Everything is temporary. I saved this one for last, but it could have gone first. And it would have been immensely helpful to understand this as a 15 year old. But, that’s not how life works. So I know this crucial bit of information instead as a 40 year old. The worst thing that happens to you is temporary. It will go away. The best thing that happens to you is temporary. It will go away. Sometimes, “going away” means you’ll adapt to it. The new car that you love becomes the old car you take for granted. Likewise, the pain of a broken heart becomes the indifferent feeling of moving on, and eventually the euphoria of new love. Sometimes it just literally goes away. The best team you’ve ever assembled will get plucked apart. And the worst shift you’ve ever worked will come to an end. The amazing body you have now will sag and break and stop working. And the anger you feel at getting passed over for the promotion will subside and turn into getting a new job where you’re more appreciated. But everything, literally everything, is fleeting. That’s simultaneously incredible and terrifying. It’s also comforting, and it keeps me focused on the extraordinary value of the only thing that is relevant in the entire world: this moment, right now. So do I have it all figured out? Hell no. Not even close. But thankfully, at the crossroads of “mental illness” and “brain that categorizes and sorts and regurgitates everything,” there lies an ever-growing litany of good plans to avoid repeating the same injuries ad nauseam. My hope is that occasionally, within my litany, you’ll find a speck of truth that applies neatly to your own journey. That’s all. But, if any of this resonates with you, let me know, and feel free to share this as you see fit! Originally published at rickeydobbs.com on February 22, 2017.",2017
So I cried at work but it’s okay.,"Today was not a great day. I cried at work. I’m in a lot of physical pain. I have a lot of anxiety that plays into the cycle of my pain, causing it and resulting from it. I’m not happy that I cried at work but I’m okay with it. I haven’t been doing a great job at self-care lately because I’ve been so busy trying to do everything without anyone noticing the strain its causing. The result is a major flare-up of my invisible injuries and a lot of extra emotional labour. I recently read this article about someone who took “wellness” to an extreme and ended up in the hospital. I feel like I do something similar but confuse multiple intensive commitments with “opportunities I must take” and “opportunities that might advance my career.” You might have noticed this when you read my anti-resolutions blog about not taking on every possible “opportunity.” (And I think it’s important that opportunity have quotation marks here.) I know marketers tell us all the time to make self-care a priority, but– and I love that the article expresses this as well– you have to define self-care for yourself. It’s SELF-care. For me, sometimes it means applying to a conference or writing an article or volunteering. But sometimes it means realizing that I physically and emotionally just can’t do those things, and that’s ok. It’s not weakness or laziness. And with my injury, it can mean the difference between being able to sit down for more than 15 minutes or needing to walk around doing made-up uncomfortable yoga. This week, it took pain that made me cry at work to realize that I need to scale back. I need to eliminate situations that cause significant stress (and that means making a very tough decision which I’ve been avoiding for months). I need to exercise after work to lessen the pain and I need to do it every day. It’s so easy to feel guilty or unproductive, and cancel those workout plans to have dinner with a friend or to get errands done. I need to work on the long-term solutions of how I respond to stresses and triggers. But in sharing my plans to take self-care seriously and learn how I personally define it, I’m hoping someone else might recognize the importance and do this with me. What does self-care mean to you?",2017
"Hello Anxiety, Let’s Have Some Tea","Anxiety, hello, my friend. We’ve been acquainted for quite some time now. What are you trying to tell me today? Today you are my Mara. Today I will open the door and let you in. I’ll experience your energy, since that’s how you communicate. So, what’s on your mind today? Because what’s on your mind is what’s on mine.",2017
"Feb 21, 2017","What’s on my mind today? Energy drinks+anxiety, medications, and anger. Oh, and water. Need more of that. However today, it settled me down. I didn’t have the twitchiness, and while i did feel the familiar racing heart I get when I have one, I didn’t feel more anxious — I felt more settled and relaxed. I didn’t have the Mach 3 thoughts. It gave me the energy I wanted — but none of the usual negatives that cause me to use an energy drink as a last resort. Strange, but it’s happened before. 2) Medications. Good lord are there a lot of medications out there. For so many different conditions and illnesses. There are people who will take a couple of tylenol at the first hint of a headache, or maybe even before. Or run for the bandages and polysporin for a small scratch. Then there are other people who will pretty much avoid medications of any kind — for fear of addiction, or not wanting to put those kinds of chemicals into their bodies, or for other reasons. Personally, I tend to lean more toward the later catagory than the former. I’ll take an advil or 2 for a bad headache or sore back. But I certainly don’t pop them like candy. I willingly take my 300mg of Welbutrin daily. (which reminds me, I really need to get back to taking Vitamin D daily!). I was fairly against taking medication of any sort to treat my anxiety and depression. I made that clear to my doctor, my counsellor, and the psychiatrist who diagnosed me. However — here’s the thing. There comes a point when you’re doing yourself more harm than good by avoiding medication. And that thought is what keeps me taking my Wellbutrin. I don’t like taking pills, I’d much prefer going without if I can. And honestly I think I’ve stabilized quite well over the last few months, and would happily dump the rest down the toilet. However, I have 2 options. Both have some scary implications. Option 1 is to stop taking meds for now, knowing sooner or later I’ll regress. I may or may not seek help in time, and best case scenario is I’ll again live daily with suicidal thoughts for months before seeking help and slowly climbing out of that pit, and fight to get back to “stable” (I really hesitate to say normal, because even though I’m fairly high functioning, I don’t really know what a normal/healthy mental and emotional life feels like). Option 2 is to keep taking my meds…. For. The. Rest. Of. My. Life. Potentially that’s 40+ years of taking pills every day. 40 years, times 2 pills a day, times 365 days. Over 29,000 pills. But, eventually my body will adapt to the current dose, and either I’ll have to take a higher dose, or change to another medication. Then there’s the fact that these medications are not that great for the body. No, they’re not nearly as brutal as cancer treatment (with it’s 1–2 punch of chemo and radiation) but still. Several years on this stuff will start affecting my internal organs at some point. And that’s something to consider too — is being stable NOW going to be worth hoping I can score a new kidney when I’m 70? Better quality of life now, hoping they can treat it better or come up with a cure “later”? My head tends to spin when I start to think about it, so I just don’t. I take my pills and hope that I recognize when things start to slide, so I can talk to my doc about increasing or changing my meds, so that I can keep having quality of life now. Because despite the risks, it sure beats the alternative. Anger. Not as a byproduct of, nor caused by my anxiety or depression. Well, yes in a way but not directly. You see, for the most part I haven’t had to fight against the stigma of mental illness. Maybe it’s because I’m higher functioning and people may not realize how hard I’ve fought. Maybe it’s because I’m very very lucky to have understanding and supportive friends, AND family, AND co-workers (well for the most part!). But I’m angry that I see and hear stories that would break your heart. People are treated like absolute garbage for a recognized illness that has been professionally diagnosed. “Suck it up and get on with your life already. Quit moping and being lazy!”. This, sadly, is a widely accepted response when it comes to depression. Not so much for say, kidney disease. Or Cancer. Now, before anyone jumps down my throat, yes things have come quite a ways, even over the last 10 or so years. That’s good, don’t get me wrong. But why isn’t it at the same level as say, kidney disease? or cancer? or a million other physical diseases? That’s what makes me angry. And sad. And frustrated. Not at the minor amounts of put-downs and slights that I’ve experienced. No, its the stories I’ve read and heard from contacts I’ve made. Stuff that gives me chills to hear of the blatant ignorance and abusive attitudes that some people display. THAT’S what makes me angry. The other thing that makes me angry is when it’s even hinted that I’m weak — I have a hard time keeping my temper and my tongue in check when I hear that. Thats enough for today. I need to do something more brain-off for the rest of the night. As always, hit that heart button if something resonated with you!",2017
Anxiety diary #1: The first step,"For me, anxiety starts in my chest. I have trouble breathing, or else I feel like I can’t take breaths deep enough to get oxygen to my brain. I feel like crying, but there’s something stopping me, and all the water pressure that’s building up blocks my throat. Most days, when I feel the weight start to crush me, I can still stand up and power through it, put my best face forward and make it past the squeeze point. Today was one of those days I didn’t stand up. I didn’t quite power through it. For the past several months I’ve been hesitating on whether or not I should seek mental health services. On one hand, I could get by most days without them. With the power of my journal, a Cognitive Behavioral Therapy app on my phone, and long runs in the mornings, I could manage. On the other hand, my usual coping mechanisms have not been matching the demand I put on them. I have been more anxious and more stressed than I have been since graduating from college three years ago. (And in hindsight I realize that I would have greatly benefited from professional counseling back then.) The anxiety was affecting my sleep, which was affecting my health, which was affecting my job performance… Yeah, who am I kidding? I definitely need mental health help. Problem was, I didn’t really know where to start. Even though mental health advocacy is something I’ve done in small ways since middle school — whether that’s raising awareness through campaigns or taking on a role as a stress management peer educator in college — I never thought that I would be the one to need these services. Not because I thought they were below me, but rather because I thought that the problems I had were so low on the scale of what people could experience that I didn’t merit a visit to a therapist. I wasn’t in crisis all the time, so I thought that my problems were things I could manage on my own. Of course, for all the mental health advocacy I’ve done, it’s almost inevitable that I would have a blind spot when it comes to me and my own mental health needs. Thankfully, I live in New York City, and I’ve been seeing ads about wellness chat services that the city offers. I decided to ease myself into it, use the chat, and talk to a counselor that way. And honestly? I was scared. Only once have I used a similar wellness hotline (during college, using a service my university provided), and even then it was a physical problem, not a mental one. When I opened the chat box tonight and waited for a counselor, I felt eerily vulnerable. Was I making the right choice? I was feeling better by the time I started the chat; did I really need the help? Still, I spoke to the counselor, though somewhat obliquely, about my mental health. I realize now, after the chat, that it helped more than I thought it did during the chat. In the span of about sixty minutes, I took the time to specifically describe what I feel during a panic attack and it helped to put it in simple terms. The counselor walked me through my anxiety and didn’t push me to reveal more than I felt comfortable with. At the end, they gave me referrals to therapists in my area who take my insurance and offer sliding scale so that I pay what I can afford. They offered to follow-up with me in a few days to make sure I contacted a therapist. I realized around the 15-minute mark that I wasn’t scared anymore. I’ve titled this piece “Anxiety diary #1,” and I hope to share more about my own experiences with anxiety and exploring mental health as I go. (And hopefully by having this out in a public space it’ll be easier for me to hold myself accountable to actually follow through with seeking mental health help.) But for tonight, I made that first step. My current mood? Exhausted, but optimistic.",2017

"“Mother,Which Flavor of Ice Cream Should I Pick?”","GAD is one of the most common disorders seen in medical settings, affecting 3% of US children and 10.8% of US adolescents (Roche, 2015). According to the Children’s National Health System, GAD occurring between the ages six and eighteen may have symptoms such as fretting about situations or decisions before, during, and after they happen, social acceptance, and school. Many adults assume this kind of worrying is normal and even a part of growing up, thus ignoring the symptoms as they appear and maintain; however, when these symptoms continue for 6 months or more, it is considered a disorder. On an episode of her CTV News show, Bell Canada addressed GAD in children. She hosted Libby Norris, a mother whose young son has GAD, and Dr. Sandra Mendlowitz, a psychologist in the child and youth outpatient mental health program at Toronto Sick Kids Hospital. Norris recalled her struggle as a mother commenting on the inadequacy of support systems at school for her son. The stigma surrounding mental illnesses made it harder to cope. Her son’s school suggested that his lack of concentration indicated ADHD; however, after a series of tests following a grand mal seizure, he was diagnosed with GAD. Concerning this common issue, Dr. Sandra Mendlowitz said, “Diagnosis can also be tricky as children suffering from the disorder may also have trouble concentrating, which may cause confusion with other mental health issues.” There is a lack of awareness about this disorder occurring in young children. It is important for parents to pay attention to their child’s feelings and not disregard their seemingly errant thoughts or behaviors as typical or unimportant. A child’s mental health is as important as his physical health and thus it is important to be aware that GAD can occur in people of all ages, even young children.

Overcoming Depression Part 10,"Day after day, I spent most of the day in bed, thoughts racing, with no answers…what kind of work could I possibly do? Who would ever love me? The answers always seemed to be…NOTHING and NO ONE…I felt hopeless. The emotional pain was unbearable.",2017
Anxiety and the Barber Shop.,"Imagine this, you’re on a Broadway stage, bright lights shining in your face, a crowd of people eagerly awaiting you to…just say something. Imagine this same scene, but now sitting in a barber’s chair. This is the exact feeling I get every single time I go into the barber. Not because I love performing on stages, but because that is the most terrifying thing to me. I like many American’s have anxiety. There are lots of different forms of anxiety and how it affects us in our daily life, but for me the absolute worst anxiety attacks I get are at the barber shop and not a single person would know. I sit anxiously awaiting my turn to go up and sit in the chair for my hair cut, I’m okay though because I can fiddle with my phone or read a magazine, I feel somewhat in control. “Next” is the trigger for me to start a small panic. I let out a tiny smile to let them know I heard because god forbid I try and speak and not be able to say something or accidentally say something completely awkward and embarrass myself. I get up and start approaching the chair, luckily by now I’m familiar with the girl who cuts my hair. She always asks if she can take my glasses for me or if I want to hold on to them. Why does she still ask this question after many years of cutting my hair? I change my mind every time I go in. Sometimes I let her take them, sometimes I don’t. Sometimes I can’t find the breath to utter the words “I’ll hold them” so I hand them to her instead. She throws the large drape over me and my hands are now useless, I can’t fiddle with my phone or read a magazine. I have lost any and all control of how I cover up my anxiousness in public. I’m now on stage, I feel as if the entire room is staring at me. Breathing has become one of the hardest things to remember how to do, The thoughts in my head of what I should do or say are racing like the Daytona 500 is in its final moments. She asks if I want my usually hair cut to which I always nod. She politely asks how my day was going and I say okay. By now she’s aware I don’t find it comfortable to hold a conversation while getting my hair cut so she turns to the other barbers and has a conversation with them while cutting away at my hair. This makes me feel normal, this helps me relax a little bit. Once she is done I get up and walk across the room to the register where I pay. I realize how sweaty my hands are and how shaky I am. Until a few months ago they always asked me to spell my last name (it is ridiculously long believe me) but for some reason I think they understand, They know that conversations here are tough for me, they know that I struggle to just survive here. They tell me the amount, I hand them my debit card and they type in my last name from that. I continue to go back to this barber shop because they make it the most comfortable I’ve ever been at a barbershop. They recognize small ques from me and know not to force conversations, or make things difficult for me that are simple for most. Recognizing signs of anxiety in someone and reacting properly to them can change someones entire life.",2017
How ‘Manchester by the Sea’ Gets Panic Attacks Right,"I suffer from crippling anxiety. The older I’ve gotten — and maybe it’s just because the proverbial pipes are cracking — panic attacks have become as routine as cooking dinner or walking my roommate’s dog along the neighborhood thoroughfare. The velocity of these panic attacks often varies, and their duration is just as unpredictable as their outcome (as is what can trigger them). I’m sure you’re familiar with — or have at least read about — the symptoms associated with panic attacks: tingling arms and hands that surrender to numbness; shortness of breath; that percussive heartbeat; disorientation and dizziness. Once you’re in the throes of panic, it feels as if you’re quarantined against your will between two separate dimensions, one where a boulder is falling on your chest and another where you’re desperately trying to tether yourself to that same boulder for safety—except in this dimension, it’s rolling away from you. It’s not an easy condition to articulate or visualize, even if at times anxiety can feel like an outer body experience. Lucas Hedges (now a Best Supporting Actor Oscar nominee) managed to articulate and visualize the most authentic onscreen panic attack in Kenneth Lonergan’s Manchester by the Sea. Where Paul Thomas Anderson’s Punch-Drunk Love and Trey Edward Shults’ Krisha recreated the texture of how anxiety feels, Hedges’ performance captures what it can look like. It’s like watching an involuntary interpretive dance — Hedges tangoing with anxiety’s tempo and panic’s rhythms. It’s a masterclass in marionette acting, where Hedges’ is the puppet and his character’s panic attack is the puppeteer. This particular sequence takes place during the second act of Manchester. Hedges’ Patrick is a 16-year-old high schooler who just lost his father to congestive heart failure and is now in the care of his emotionally paralyzed uncle Lee (Casey Affleck). Late one night, he gets up to grab a snack from the fridge. When he doesn’t see anything in there he decides to try the freezer. Upon opening the freezer door, a couple packs of frozen chicken come tumbling out and land on the floor—and this minuscule inconvenience triggers the beginning of Patrick’s physical and emotional avalanche. What should have been an easy fix becomes an oppressive force of failed repetition. He tries to put the chicken packs back in the freezer, but they fall back out before he can shut the door. Patrick bends over to pick them up again, but hits his head on the freezer door on its backswing. Growing increasingly flustered, he violently shoves the chicken back into the freezer and tries to slam the door shut before they spill out again, but to no avail. This pattern happens again and again for what feels like an eternity, but it’s only 30 seconds. Hedges, with a pained subtlety and a flushed face, begins clutching his chest as his breathing accelerates. He’s lost power over his own body. Now he’s just standing in the kitchen, violently slamming the freezer door over and over, panic rippling through Hedges’ stiff skeleton. He’s been reduced to a frozen slab of meat in real time, consumed by the maw of a monstrous emotional maelstrom. Hedges begins to cry uncontrollably and collapses as his Uncle Lee rushes to see what all the commotion is, but there’s nothing scene-chewy about it. Hedges is in total control as a performer; his mannerisms mid-attack are imbued with such a natural unwieldy intensity — down to the fidgeting fingers and the imperceptible mumbling to himself — that it’s hard not to believe he hasn’t been here before, off-screen. The scene is a perfect storm of powerhouse performance and perceptive writing. Hedges was the vessel to showcase Lonergan’s uncanny ability to transmute the quotidian into the devastating. In November, upon the film’s release, Lonergan discussed this very scene in an interview with NPR’s Fresh Air. “Patrick is very, very upset because he has a — finally has a breakdown. His father — they can’t bury the father right away because the ground is too hard, and the cemetery he’s going to be buried in doesn’t allow the use of heavy equipment. So they have to wait till spring to bury the father. “The image of his father being frozen in the interim is very disturbing to Patrick. And he’s been pretty stoical about the whole thing until he knocks some frozen chicken from the freezer onto the floor and he has a panic attack. And Lucas does the scene beautifully. He has this real breakdown and he’s sobbing, and he’s just terrified and upset by the sight of this frozen food because it’s reminding him of his father being a body and not a person.” I spoke with Iresha Picot, licensed behavioral specialist, outpatient therapist and co-editor of The Color of Hope: People of Color Mental Health Narratives about this scene. Picot says, “It appears from Patrick’s situation that his panic attack could be derived from Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), which is distressing thoughts that recall a traumatic event. PTSD is not always readily shown when the incident happens, as that person may be suppressing their feelings or has not made the connection between their physiological reactions to the traumatic event.” Throughout Manchester leading up to that freezer scene, Hedges played Patrick as a cool, insouciant teen hiding behind a particular brand of performative masculinity. In his white working-class Massachusetts milieu, he was conditioned by the men around him to believe that vulnerability was weakness. In his world, men barely talked to or touched one another unless they were colliding on the ice hockey rink or exchanging blows like amateur pugilists after one-too-many at the local pub. Affleck’s Lee dissociated and folded into himself in the wake of his own personal trauma. Patrick tried his damnedest, but just couldn’t keep his grief bottled in anymore. “Trauma being suppressed and untreated can increase the intensity of anxiety,” Picot continued. “This trauma can cause an autonomic hyperactivity, being that the person has not learned the effective coping skills or medication management to stabilize their anxiety.” Watching Hedges carry that burden of buried pained throughout Manchester was like watching someone shave shaving cream off a balloon with a straight razor. Teeming below his too-cool-to-care, manly surface was a hurt little boy on the verge of popping. Hedges as a performer shouldered that bifurcated emotional baggage masterfully. While the Oscar for Best Supporting Actor will likely be going home with Moonlight’s Mahershala Ali on Sunday night (and rightfully so), I am beyond happy that Hedges got this coveted nomination after being virtually ignored throughout awards season while his co-stars basked in praise. It’s a painfully honest performance, one that reminds those who suffer from anxiety that even if there is no permanent panacea (though this gif can help), there can be comfort when you can find a way to confront what’s inside you. outtake.tribecashortlist.com",2017
How I’ve embraced my insomnia to adapt a sense of self,"I have had insomnia for the majority of my life. It’s not something that I’ve considered to be a bad thing until I became a (true) adult who has to be at work at a reasonable hour. I say ‘true’ because when I was a teenager, it didn’t matter that I couldn’t sleep. In fact, I preferred to study and play my video games at night. Now, however, I face a constant battle of the ‘in-between’ on an almost daily basis. At 25 years old, it’s no longer a simple refusal of sleep; it’s a challenge in itself. So then, what does insomnia mean to me? It means a hurricane of thoughts, fragments of memories, the heavy weight of anxiety, a quick pounding of the heart. It means that I will probably be tired when I wake up. I would try and sleep, lay for hours, and just feel the frustration build. Fortunately, I’ve learned to change that mindset into something much more positive. I am by no means ‘cured’ nor am I saying that what I’ve done to help myself will help you. But I wanted to bring them to light anyway because I work at a tech company that is driven by ideas and production – I can’t always show colleagues that I am fatigued. So I’ve made some small changes that I know are good for me mentally and emotionally. Believe it or not, I have to remind myself to drink water throughout the day. I was maybe drinking 3 cups max a day, which I now see as laughable. Being hydrated constantly makes a huge difference – dehydration can cause anxiety as your cells feel a general sense of worry to your subconscious mind, which sometimes cause depression. So now I refill the tumbler I have on my desk every other hour. Water isn’t the only thing that I’ve started drinking. I’ve started drinking boat loads of tea as well. I probably drink 3–5 cups a day. My favourite tea makers are David’s Tea and Lamill Coffee. I’ve always been a spiritual person, but I think it’s a kind of intangible connection that I’ve always felt. I wouldn’t say that I practiced any specific ceremonies in my adult life, until I realized that I actually feel better doing some of the little things. I carry 3 crystals with me everywhere I go: Rose Quartz, Smokey Quartz, and Dalmatian Jasper. The Rose Quartz represents peace, emotional healing and, unconditional love. My Smokey Quartz is for stress release, protection against negativity, and detoxification. I carry my Dalmatian Jasper for grounding, protection, and transforming negative energy. On very difficult days, I place them above my bed to help me sleep. It gives me comfort. I spritz my ever reliable Saje’s Anti Stress Mist in Unwind every night before I go to bed and the smell relaxes me. A lot. I love to paint and I love to draw. These are two things that have been consistent in my life. I don’t particularly think I draw well but I do love to do it anyway because in those minutes or hours or days (depending on how complex the piece is), I forget about everything else and I concentrate on literally painting in the lines. It’s legit hard to colour within the lines and I don’t know why we ever let kids do that! I wonder if that’s why a lot of us feel out of control when we aren’t perfect. Last night, I went to the Vancouver chapter of Ladies, Wine and Design. I signed up for this way back in November and I was so stoked to see an email from Sasha, one of the organizers. It was honestly so easy. It was intimate. The conversations flowed so beautifully about being a woman in a male dominated industry, about our fears of not being good enough, about how we can give back and share what we know to our community. I have lots more to say about this because it was truly an awesome experience. But I’ll stop here because I do want to talk about this in another post! Nerd alert. I love whiteboarding. This is a term I’ve come to live and breathe over the last 3 years. In my day to day, I am constantly solving problems, presenting designs, getting feedback, and refining. It’s a process of repetition and I kind of like that for the most part, I am in front of a whiteboard, sketching out ideas and making diagram of sorts. Seeing data points on stickies excite me like no other! When I am stressed and anxious, I make time to do more of these networking events or pairing with another designer to bounce ideas off them. It’s a great way to feel good about yourself and your work. So, when I can’t sleep I try and read. My first instinct is always Netflix or Youtube but I realize now that watching videos don’t help my brain shut down. It stimulates it because if I watch a crazy show, I think about it all night. I know it shouldn’t affect me but it does. I grew up reading. Every single person in my family is a bookworm. It’s probably the coolest thing we share, even if we do read different genres. I read everything from graphic novels to fiction, and I’m no longer afraid to say that I have recently taken up more books about self-healing and self-expression. Whatever it may be that I’m reading, I completely lose myself in the images and words — this means I’m not worrying about anything except for what’s about to happen on the next page. Those are just some of the things that I’ve started doing in the last few months. I still have insomnia; I still have anxiety. But writing these and making an effort to be open to new things is I think a great step towards being okay. Of course it’ll take time to become 100% whole again, but I hope that if you are in the same situation, my words and experience inspires you to seek the unfamiliar and find what feels right.",2017
Year 6,"March 6th marks my 6th year of streaming. Yet I may not be able to celebrate it like I have in the past. I’m still dealing with a lot of personal issues. The long story turned short(this is a lie) is ever since I lived with a friend back in Missoula, my anxiety and noise aversion began to seep into me and has hindered my ability to relax, sleep, and co-exist with people. In Chicago, any loud noise made by anyone or anything would make my mind race and put me in defense mode, worrying, blaming, feeling grief for blaming, feeding my depression worse and worse. I came back and moved in with a friend to Missoula again, yet had similar problems with noises and was even more annoyed. Last May I moved back home due to this stress, not to mention helping my parents with finances. I am on the lower level of a split level house, and no matter how quiet, quick, or small any noise is it puts me on immediate edge. My nieces come over almost every weekend and sometimes stay longer, and once again has only fed into all of my mental issues. This has caused less streaming and in general a worse mood. I switched medication to help with anxiety/depression, but that only helped so much. I love my nieces, in fact we always have fun and laugh when I get to hang out with them. Yet the noise, banging as kids are kids, puts me on edge when before I wouldn’t be bothered. This has led to a couple of heated confrontations with my parents, yet I immediately felt horrible afterwards. I’m not lying when I say that I wanted to use money I got from Twitch to go out, buy a gun, and end my life. This came to a head 2 weeks ago when I collapsed and inured myself, and felt not loved when the kids were over again and I couldn’t get sleep/rest when I was injured. I know that’s not the case, I know that my parents care and love, but when I get that anxiety I feel like everyone and everything is out to get me, make me feel miserable, I feel guilty, I want to die. I told my mom that I was going to kill myself. Thankfully, cooler heads prevailed, and now I’m in the process of moving out to an apartment or small house in a town smaller yet larger than my hometown. Going to make sure it doesn’t have noisy neighbors and such to help with anxiety. This also led to a discussion with my therapist, and she is recommending me for a neuro psych evaluation to determine if I have extreme anxiety due to my noise anxiety. In addition to helping with my anxiety, it is also hoped that it will help with my insomnia as well. Going to go to therapy more as well. What does this mean for Year 6? Possibly how the past few months have gone, which is better than what has happened Year 5. I imagine once I get used to the new place and I’m not on edge I will be able to stream more regularly. I don’t think I’ll ever go back to streaming every single day for 8–12 hours, but I’m ok with that. I’m going to do more variety once I get more regular streams going, but I’m also going to have a healthy dose of MC. My stream has changed, I’ve changed, and to those who stuck around you’re amazing. To those that haven’t, that’s ok, that’s just how life works out. I love you all ❤ P.S. Decided to add a list of things that changed for the better in Year 5.",2017
Diário de uma mente ansiosa,"Após algumas semanas [ok, meses na verdade] de trabalho intenso, agenda apertada e cronometrada, tentativas de equilibrar todas as demandas, pouco tempo livre, meus sintomas ansiosos voltaram, como se nunca tivessem diminuído. Eles são vários. Os físicos envolvem dores na região dos ombros/pescoço e cansaço. Os emocionais e psicológicos se apoderam da minha clareza e tranquilidade, fazendo com que meu cérebro se acelere. Pensa, questiona, decide, volta atrás, duvida, se desespera, tudo isso em segundos. Meus pensamentos focam 100% do tempo nos problemas que precisam ser resolvidos, mas não de uma forma construtiva, levantando soluções, dando ideias criativas. Não. Pensa em cenários absurdos, em tudo que pode dar errado, tudo que pode não funcionar, tudo que deveria ser feito e ainda não foi feito, como outras pessoas teriam lidado com a mesma situação, como eu deveria ter agido diferente, na insegurança se um dia irei conseguir, se um dia vai dar certo, o quanto tudo é tão difícil. Nesse processo todo, fica mais difícil relaxar, me divertir, concentrar no momento presente [ser mindful], relaxar. Com toda essa pressão, minha paciência com outras pessoas ou em resolver os problemas diminui, tudo fica tão sério. Sou invadida por um sentimento de solidão, de que preciso buscar ajuda, de que devo buscar respostas, como se elas não estivessem dentro de mim, como se a cura fosse vir da fala de outras pessoas. Sinto que começo a exigir resultados positivos, sem exatamente aproveitar e aprender com o processo como poderia. Sinto que é como se eu prendesse a respiração, determinada em fazer tudo isso passar logo. [Observação: é um perigo querer que tudo apenas passe logo, porque provavelmente não estamos desfrutando de momentos que não vão voltar.] E, em algum momento, vem a culpa ou a pressão de que eu não deveria estar pensando sobre tudo isso. Quem estou me cobrando demais. Que estou sendo ansiosa. Que tenho que “melhorar” logo. Como me recuperei? Fazer yoga ajudou. Respirar ajudou. Correr ajudou. Conversar com pessoas importantes pra mim ajudou. Agradecer por tudo que existe de positivo na minha vida ajudou. Focar no processo, para tentar aprender e até mesmo me divertir também ajudou. No entanto, acho que tiveram 2 pontos fundamentais para eu voltar a reconectar comigo mesma. Eles estão profundamente conectados. O primeiro foi aproveitar as pausas. Depois de um trabalho entregue, parar de pensar logo no próximo ou em tudo o que ainda deve ser feito e desfrutar o direito de pausar. Para reorganizar a mente e o corpo. Para refletir sobre como foi o processo e repensar nas prioridades. O segundo foi me conscientizar de todos os sintomas e me questionar o motivo de estar passando por todos eles. Quais eram os medos em questão? Quais eram as causas da pressão que estava sentindo? O que os sintomas estavam querendo me mostrar? Que tipo de pensamento me levavam a esses sintomas? E que decisão eu deveria tomar? A partir dessas reflexões, criei novas metas e prioridades para os meus próximos dias. Decidi voltar a investir mais na minha evolução espiritual. E percebi que esses ciclos de clareza e leveza vs. ansiedade e pressão são contínuos. Percebi também que a minha evolução não vai me trazer estabilidade, vai trazer novas oscilações de aprendizado. E que vou dar meu 100% para passar conscientemente por todos eles. Curtiu? Me ajude a impactar mais gente, CLIQUE no ❤ !

The Making Of an Indebted Man,"I read my books. I stared out the window. I watched the sun set and the sun rise. I drew pictures. I followed my breathing. I meditated upon various things. I remembered my youth. I masturbated. I ate food that was delivered to me from a health food co-op. I felt peaceful. I lived off money that was provided to me by the generosity of others. I was not doing anything with my life and as a result I felt like I was living fully. My mother would occasionally visit me and become mad. She always brought me flowers (I don’t know why). My mother bringing me flowers made me feel very uncomfortable. Why was I just sitting in that chair? She was angry that I was not doing anything with my life (my father could not even deal with visiting me). She could not understand that I was doing everything with my life. She wanted me to get up more. She did not think that spending all my time in a chair, alone in my room was healthy for a young man. I told her that the greatest thing about my life was that I was a man free of debt (I told her this because I knew she lived buried in debt). My father and my mother owned two large homes. They had numerous credit cards. Several cars. A small airplane. My main memories of my father and mother are of them sitting around the kitchen table with a large check book opened and stacks and stacks of bills piled up in the center of the table. As a kid I knew that I did not want that to be me. But then my mother said to me one day when she came to visit: Debt my son is a wonderful thing. It is what our society is built upon and it is what allows us to have a good life. I didn’t know why, but my mother’s words often had a strong unconscious influence over me. They made me do things that I knew I really did not want to do. A man dressed in a standard business man’s suit came into my room one day. He was carrying a briefcase. I was at the point where I was trying to teach myself how to walk on the ceiling. I would not sit in the chair as much and instead I would learn how to walk on the ceiling. That would feel like a valid accomplishment to me. I was obsessed and fascinated with the idea of learning how to walk on the ceiling. My imagination was running wild. The man offered me an American Express Card, a MasterCard and the opportunity to have any graduate school of my choice paid for by a loan. He told me that these things would drastically improve my life and I decided to think about it. Should I give up learning how to walk on the ceiling? Should I not be spending so much time sitting in my chair, enjoying my life? Suddenly I felt bad for the way I was living. Irresponsible. Failed. Maybe there was a more adult way to live? Maybe debt could give me an even better life than the one I already had? I would at least make my mother, father, father-in-law, mother-in-law, grandmother, grandfather, uncle, aunt, wife, creditors, debtors, president, congress people, advertisers, business owners and others that I was not aware of proud. When the man dressed in the standard business suit returned to my room I told him ok. I signed several things. I took the cards. I chose a graduate school that I would attend and the man told me when I could start. He gave me a check that he told me I would pay back someday in the distant future. Congratulations son. You have made a smart choice for the direction of your life. Welcome to being a contributing member of society. This idea made me nervous but I went to graduate school anyways. I got a graduate degree. I was then offered a house and decided why not. It would be nice to have my own home. A different man in a suit told me that the house could be all mine if I just signed here and here and here and here and here and here and here and here and here and here and here and here and here and here and here and here and here and here and here and here and here and here and here and here and here and here and here and here and here and here and here and here and here and here and here and here and here and here and here and here and here and here and here and here and here and here and here and here and here and here and here and here and here and here and here and here and here and here and here and here and here and here and here and here and here and here and here and here and here and here and here and here and here and here and here and here and here and here and here and here and here and here and here and here and here and here and here and here and here and here and here and here and here and here and here and here and here and here and here and here and here and here and here and here and here and here and here and here and here and here and here and here and here and here and here and here and here and here and here and here and here and here and here and here and here and here and here and here and here and here and here and here and here and here and here and here and here and here and here and here and here and here and here and here. I got the house. It was a nice house with a large backyard. I bought furniture for the house with the cards that I was given by the first man in the standard business suit. I was then offered more cards by various strangers who seemed so happy to give them to me. Credit cards were being offered to me by everyone. I had never felt like such an accomplished and trustworthy person before, so I said yes to all of them. I figured this was the responsible thing to do. I had made it! I bought a car. I rented an office and started the business that I was told to start by the people in graduate school. I bought more furniture for my office with the cards that proudly displayed my name on them. Suddenly I felt like someone important. I felt like I was living a legitimate, adult life. I bought patio furniture. My mother, father, father-in-law, mother-in-law, grandmother, grandfather, uncle, aunt, wife, creditors, debtors, president, congress people, advertisers, business owners and others all seemed proud of me. They all wanted to talk with me. When I walked into other people’s businesses I was treated with respect. I had accomplished great things now that I was a man in debt. Suddenly people wanted to spend time with me and pay me for my time. I could buy whatever I wanted but the strange thing was that I started to feel very sad and had no idea why. I missed those days when I spent day and night just sitting in a chair. I regretted that I had not learned how to walk on the ceiling. I was too busy and occupied now. If I spent too much time sitting in a chair I noticed that I felt bad. I tried but I always felt like I should be doing something else. I checked my iPhone a lot. I had a business to attend to. A house to run and keep clean. Things needed to get done and just sitting in a chair felt like I was letting important things remain undone. Now I was not anxious because of the reality of death, but I had dozens of others things that I worried could go wrong. My hair started to thin and fall out. I felt a dark despair in me that I had never felt before but began using my cards more to buy things and an effort to get the despair to go away. I bought expensive healing products to heal the diseases I felt like I was vulnerable of catching as a result of living a more stress-filled, adult life. I drank more wine to make the anxiety dissolve away. I would forget to pay bills. I didn’t have energy to pay bills. How did my parents do it? I didn’t want to pay certain bills. Why should I pay my student loan back, when this was the life it had gotten me into? The man in the standard looking business suit had not told me the truth. I felt more and more depressed. More and more trapped. I longed for the simpler times when I was perfectly content just sitting in my chair. I just wanted to be able to walk on the ceiling and do other spontaneous and creative things. Instead, my life became routine. There was nothing else to do. No one else seemed to notice how much I was suffering. I thought about ending my life. I thought about how trapped I felt. I felt rage towards the men in business suits and my mother for giving me terrible advice. I felt set up. I started experiencing anxiety attacks and was given Lexapro by another man in a nicer suit. After several weeks of taking the pills I started to feel better. I started to feel a bit more relaxed and content in my life. It was working! The despair and anxiety subsided and gradually I was not so miserable going to work. My sex drive vanished, I put on a bit of weight but when I sat down at my kitchen table and paid off the stack of bills, it didn’t feel so bad. Now I could begin getting my credit score back on track. I could start exercising, meditating and maybe even reading again. I could begin to just enjoy working, driving, buying things, hanging out with other people, taking care of my house and living an average life in the suburbs. It felt nice. I lost all interest in learning how to walk on the ceiling but who cares, that sort of thing doesn’t matter anyways.",2017
Mental Health Matters: Anxiety in the Family,"There are many types of anxiety states such as generalized anxiety disorder (tension felt most of the time), panic attacks, obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) and phobias. They all can cause low self-esteem, a sense of shame, and may be hard to talk about. Psychotherapy To address undue suffering psychotherapy with treatment plans (with or without medication) can help you lead a more relaxed, productive life. Keep in mind that anxiety can persist for many years if left untreated. The key is early intervention with an experienced psychotherapist who gives you a greater opportunity for relief. Anxiety in Adults: Panic Disorders Consider a panic disorder, also known as an anxiety attack. Your heart may feel like it’s pounding and racing. You may feel like you have butterflies in your stomach, or get a dizzy sensation. You’re generally nervous and ill at ease. Learning the causes of the attack combined with techniques to stop the panic can offer you a welcomed calm state of mind. Anxiety in Children: Sleep Disturbances Imagine your child is suddenly afraid of the dark. Monsters creep into her mind disturbing her sleep. To prevent the development of a persistent sleep problem you want to act quickly with the guidance of a trained professional. Psychotherapy involving parent and child gives solutions that settle those evenings down. Perhaps there was an incident at school the child fears recurring that keeps her awake. Or, maybe she misses two working parents and has anxiety separating before bed. Disturbed sleep patterns can be regulated when they are understood relieving both parent and child. Anxiety in Teens: Shifting Moods Maybe your teen seems irritable with shifting moods. A professional can help the teen explore what’s bothering him that leads to solutions. Parents can be guided to understand their teen’s behavior such as how anger can mask anxiety. Mental Health and Well-Being Good mental health is the cornerstone of our well-being Anxiety decreases concentration, general productivity and lowers self-esteem. While anxiety is very common, each outbreak is individual. The best way to protect yourself and your kids is to seek an effective individually designed treatment plan so the well-being of the whole family benefits. This can be done with the utmost privacy for parent and child. If there are any problems in your family you would like me to address in future columns let me know by writing confidentially to dr.lauriehollmanphd.com.

"“It’s Not You, It’s Me”: Dating and Anxiety","A common trend, unfortunately, seems to be the desire to appear normal, at almost any cost. Particularly, in the Black community, discussion of or admittance to having any sort of wellness offset can be a great taboo. Denial of social, mental, and emotional disorders can have excessive side effects that will impact your life and the lives of those connected to you. It is important to learn to 1. Be honest with yourself about your wellness and 2. Help those you love understand, remotely, what you’re dealing with. Especially your significant other. We cannot expect to build lifelong, committed, and honest relationships with anyone, particularly a spouse, if we have not dealt with our own issues, first. This article will briefly outline key components to working through a romantic relationship while living with social, mental, and emotional illnesses. Have you ever found yourself in a situation where your significant other was full of energy and eager to enjoy a night on the town, while you were in no mood to be social? What do you do when you’re battling with yourself about all the things that can go wrong with a situation before you even embark on the journey? Has there ever been a day, week, or significant lapse in time where all you felt was a desire to do nothing at all for a reason you also could not decipher on your own? These are common, examples of the subconscious occurrences of someone living with general anxiety, depression, social anxiety, or some other disorder or ailment. For some who live with these things, as I do with anxiety, we have learned to cope in various ways; we had to seek out and actively apply systems that would help us prevent “episodes” or allow us to be open to support from others while we deal with our pressures of life. Photo courtesy of http://www.healthyblackwoman.com When dating, it is important to be clear with your partner about your disorders. Consider the fact that you are growing with someone, in hopes of committing to marriage and maybe even raising children down the line. Your mannerisms, at times, will be attributed to your disorder, but how will they know that unless they’ve previously been made aware? How will they know what you need if it has not ever been discussed? Furthermore, how shall you both deal with your children who may inherit or develop a disorder of their own? If you are seriously courting, make one point of conversation your health and wellness. This is not something that we should “spring” on anyone, as it takes time to adjust. In congruence with awareness, there must also be understanding on our end. We have to be honest with ourselves when being candid with our future spouses: this won’t be easy, and it won’t always make sense. But, it can be overcome. Sometimes, when we get in our moods of depression or are too anxious to make up our minds about anything, and when the right words are far from our lips, we cannot be quick to anger with our partners because of what they may not understand. We cannot grow more anxious, or depressed, or frustrated with them or ourselves when their reaction to or interaction with us has been challenged beyond immediate control or repair. Patience is the name of this game. Express your feelings as fluidly as possible and allow them to ask questions to broaden their knowledge. This openness will incur trust and strengthen the bond between you (or at the least, help you to discern who is your soulmate and who is not). So, if you’re dating or open to dating and are battling a wellness disorder, remember that you are not a burden, anyone willing to share in life with you as you overcome this struggle is someone worth investing in. Take a chance on opening up and allowing yourself to be loved, flaws and all. comments Originally published at thesinglewivesclub.com on February 23, 2017.",2017
Selling Your Stuff Can Clear More Than Physical Space,"A friend of mine recently told me that he felt weighed down by the amount of belongings he had. If he wanted to move, the constant worry of “I don’t have room for this stuff” would always haunt him. After disposing of furniture, clothes and misc, he felt more free. Today, he can move anywhere he desires, not limited by physical space and concern. I have found myself in a similar predicament. In just three weeks I will be moving out of my parents house to embark on the next chapter of my life, “my first job after college”. As I started thinking about this transition period, one of the first thoughts that came to mind, “what am I going to do with all my sh** when I move?”. Just then, a light bulb flashed! My phone is the best resource. Apps like Letgo and Facebook Marketplace make it so easy to buy or sell anything; furniture, clothes, sports equipment, even jewelry. I have always used these apps to buy stuff, but with a collection of furniture adding up, I became a seller. In just two weeks, I have gotten rid of so many bulky items while making a profit in the process. A couple suitcases in the doorway. I feel of sense of freedom as I look around my room. All I have to my name is what I need; clothes, pictures, electronics and care products. No matter which direction I decide to go, I will never be held back by unnecessary belongings.",2017
Phobia,"Phobia is a type of anxiety disorder with some similar physical symptoms and emotional responses as that of anxiety itself, the difference being that phobias are fears of specific things as opposed to more generalized tension and worry. Traumatic childhood experiences can increase one’s risk for anxiety disorders, including phobias. Treatment may include exposure to the feared object with response prevention, as well as the aid of certain medications. Deeper Dive: What is Phobia? Heights, spiders, public speaking, and flying — these are examples of common phobias that we have all probably heard of before. A phobia is defined as an excessive worry or fear about a specific object, event, task, or situation. This could range from a simple phobia, such as a fear of snakes, to more complex ones, such as a social phobia, which involves a fear of interacting with people, especially in large groups. Though fear and anxiety are normal reactions to things one might encounter in everyday life, these feelings can become a disorder — a phobia — when they refuse to go away and begin to disrupt normal daily functioning. Causes Research has shown that phobias, like other anxiety disorders, seem to be caused by the interaction of both environmental and genetic factors, along with biology. Adverse or stressful experiences, whether in childhood or adulthood, can also contribute. Symptoms The prevailing symptom of a phobia is the avoidance of the specific thing that causes anxiety and fear. Here are some examples of this: Aside from avoidance, the symptoms of a phobia vary depending on the specific object of the person’s fear or worry. For example, the specific symptoms of social phobia, more commonly referred to as social anxiety disorder, revolve around social situations. These symptoms can include feeling self-conscious around other people, a fear of being rejected or embarrassed, worrying about offending other people, a difficulty being around or talking to other people, a fear of being judged by other people, a difficulty making and then keeping friends, or feeling sick or nauseous around other people. Some of the more general physical and emotional symptoms of phobia are similar to that of general anxiety. These symptoms can include increased heart rate, trembling or sweating, restlessness, muscle tension, irritability, difficulty concentrating, and difficulty controlling one’s worry. Am I at Risk? Phobias, along with generalized anxiety, have been found to be the most common among teens between 13 years and 18 years of age, and are also the most common anxiety disorders among adults. Similar to other anxiety disorders, some risk factors for phobias include being female, shyness in childhood, having a close family history of anxiety disorders, having a parent with a mental disorder, exposure to traumatic or stressful events, having had a divorce or been widowed, and having little financial resources. While a fear response may be normal in some contexts, intense anxiety and worry about a specific thing that doesn’t go away or prevents one from going about his or her usual activities can be debilitating. That’s why it’s important to talk with your doctor or therapist and let them know of any concerns in this area.",2017
#08 Should I have myself checked?,"*phone rings**Boss calls**call end**phone rings again* What am I Supposed to do? Should I pick up? Did I make any trouble?? Did I spoil anything?? *call end**phone rings again* Maybe there is something important. But what?? What is the last thing we discussed?? *immediate recalls**call end**phone rings again* PICK UP NO PICK UP NO PICK UP NO PICK UP *call end* I don’t think I spoiled any…… I’ll pick up if he calls me one more time…. *hope he will not**phone rings again* “Yes, good afternoon Sir.” — - Every phone conversation I pick up is always smooth. So far I’ve never had awkward conversation with my Boss, because all we talk about is work, work, and work. But as you can see at the conversation above; I have this anxiety when it comes to phone call. I still cannot figure out what I am afraid of. The problem is not on him, it just frights me every time it rings. And five calls are enough to convince me; an urgent signal. The problem is on me when he calls me every time for a small, trivial, inconsequential (work) matter, and I don’t feel comfortable about it. My Boss is the kind of people who invites people to discuss and interacts with people whenever he could. He is also easily distracted; a lot of ideas whirling in his head (and spoils to his whiteboard). Sometimes, we (his subordinates) are quite relieved to know if he’s on business trip (he does a lot, btw). I think he’s way too eligible at his current position. We all agree he deserves a promotion. Anywaaay, it wasn’t a big deal if the one he talks to is an extrovert, like Kak Debbie, my coworker. She receives so many calls every day and yet seems enjoy every conversation she has. Yes, my Boss also calls her almost every single day. But to me, he could have just text me. I am better at texting. — - “ I’m sorry I didn’t answer my phone when you called. I don’t use it for that.”-anonymous",2017
Not as perfect as it was,"Last Monday morning I started to feel really tired and apathetic. I wasn’t able to sit straight at work. I hated myself for that. Still after work I got out for usual jogging, but I just couldn’t run. So I changed my run into stroll and somehow understood I just need day or two of rest, since I haven’t one in 6 days of everyday jogging. I tried to sit straight at work everyday too. I meditate after jogging. So my spine and knees had to be tired I guess. But I felt tired, apathetic and generally really shitty through whole work-week. I went for a run on Saturday morning and I felt much better, but still I didn’t go jogging again yet. I violated sticking to “not eating sugar” too because I was bored and felt I need to eat something to feel better. I feel guilty for not sticking to my plans, and overall refreshed feeling of chaos in my life is paradoxically keeping me from going back to my healthier lifestyle that made me feel much better. It is not perfect as it was so I just can’t go out and run. And somehow fact that I stopped for a while makes me feel hopeless to start and try it again. I know not eating sugar makes me feel better. I know not eating in front of PC makes me feel better. I know running makes me feel better. I know being outside makes me feel better. I know what makes me feel worse, still I recently did those things. Somehow running everyday was easier then doing it 3 times a week. I stopped meditating too. Somehow it was easier to meditate after running. But my knees and legs hurted so my body responded: “That is too much!” I need a balance, but I am not sure if I am able to run “just” 3 or 4 times a week. Maybe that is my perfectionism that keeps me from living balanced, happy and relaxed life. I just want to do those things ideally everyday and not hating myself if I will not. But who knows what was real cause of my tiredness. I just want to do this everyday: Today after work I will do just that — I will go running, after that I will have 15 push-ups, then nice shower, and I will feel great, I know I will! That is why I want to do it. Then I will clean a little. I will eat in a kitchen, but not too much. Then I will be on PC, maybe watch a movie or TV show, then I will go to bed and read a book. Very nice program indeed. I am looking forward to it.",2017
Overcoming Depression Part 11,"I spent most of my days in bed. As a result, I was willing to go back to therapy. However, therapy at that point was simply getting me out of bed for 2 hours a week. It simply wasnt working. The suggestion made to me was to attend a day hospital program. I went to visit the program, and I was horrified to see what looked like seriously mentally ill people. I’m not sure what I thought I was at that point…I certainly didnt want to look myself in the mirror. My options looked really clear, and, really bleak…day hospital, or…and so I made my first suicide attempt. With my parents out, I brought my car into the garage with the engine running…",2017
My Piece of Release: Feel,"Toes barely touch as she ventures away Onto her back then her body gives way Weightless and free, the beat starts to decay And fades from her ears in a rhythmic sway. Away at last from all the commotion Begins to rid her of all emotions Fingertips wide, accepting, and open Each bone chills as she floats on the ocean. Softly closing her eyes makes her aware She then becomes numb, with lungs full of air Holding it in, as long as she can bear Lets her free, on a journey to Nowhere. She is the driftwood; She is without fear. Nothing is real; It couldn’t be more clear.",2017
Sotto la corazza II,"Questo è l’unico momento della giornata dove Lui non può uccidere le tue speranze e i tuoi desideri. Non può costringerti a tornare alla dura realtà, non può perché non glielo permetti — grazie all’aiuto delle gocce. Quando finalmente chiudi gli occhi, ritrovi quel mondo che vorresti vedere tutti i giorni: sorrisi, gentilezza, caldo, mare, una casa tutta tua arredata con quei mobili neri con il piano in legno chiaro che tutte le volte che vedi accarezzi con la tenerezza di una mamma. Ritrovi i tuoi cari, che ti abbracciano, ti regalano un consiglio, un sorriso o solamente l’ennesima litigata per questioni futili che termina con la solita grossa risata. Ritrovi quei due che ti hanno abbandonata, che ti chiedono scusa per essere stati la prima causa di insicurezza di tutta la tua vita e ti chiedono come è stata convivere col fatto che due idioti, che dovevano essere i tuoi nonni, sono state le prime persone al mondo — alla sola età di sei mesi — a non accettarti. Ritrovi tutti quegli animali che non sono più con te e che vorresti coccolare un’ultima volta, ritrovi quel libro che chissà dove l’hai messo ma lì è il primo dello scaffale. Viaggi. Nonostante tu non abbia un soldo per comprarti un maglioncino dei cinesi, lì puoi viaggiare. Vai in Giappone, Cina, Corea del Sud, Hawaii, Caraibi, Australia. Mangi piatti buonissimi, vedi posti bellissimi, nuoti con gli squali, vai in barca a vela, attraversi il deserto australiano con la moto da cross, conosci persone di cuore, con quei sorrisi genuini che non vedi da tanto tempo. Compri quei gioielli etnici che tanto ti piacciono e di cui possiedi solo delle imitazioni scadenti, quei poncho bellissimi tessuti a mano, quei vestiti incantevoli che ti fanno brillare gli occhi ogni volta che li vedi in TV in qualche documentario. Sei di nuovo magra come prima della tiroide, con i ricci tutti a posto e i capelli lunghi, che non riesci mai a fare crescere perché perdi prima la pazienza. Sei realizzata, lì puoi fare tutto. Puoi essere mamma, nonna, zia. Puoi essere single con un ranch pieno di pony e quokka, un’esploratrice o una subacquea. Puoi avere una casa con degli acquari che Genova e Barcellona sono un 20L per i pesci rossi, puoi andare a cena con gli Alter Bridge oggi, accudire i serpenti di Slash domani ed essere ad un concerto di David Garrett dopodomani. Puoi fare il lavoro che hai sempre sognato o non fare nulla perché non si sa da dove arrivano i soldi per fare quello che più ti piace. Puoi leggere intere biblioteche in poche ore, essere un hacker oppure la più temibile di tutti gli investigatori. Puoi avere giardini pieni di orchidee rarissime, lo stagno con le carpe koi che ti rilassa tanto e quella sedia a dondolo di vimini sospesa che tanto ti era piaciuta quando l’hai vista alle terme. In questo mondo non sei preoccupata, hai i mezzi e la tranquillità necessaria er affrontare qualsiasi difficoltà. Non ti spaventa nulla, non hai ansie e non hai preoccupazioni. Trovi sempre chi ti supporta con un sorriso ed una parola gentile. Nessuno ha la cattiveria necessaria per ferirti e nessuno lo vuole neppure fare. Ti alzi in questo mondo bellissimo con il rumore delle onde e vai a dormire con il rumore delle onde. Quando sei qui, il tempo è relativo. Possono passare poche ore come anni. Se solo al risveglio ti ricordassi tutti i particolari dei tuoi sogni, Salgari forse potrebbe non essere più il re dei romanzi d’avventura. Qui sei quella che tuti i giorni cerchi di essere senza riuscirci. Senza sforzi e con naturalezza. Puoi essere te stessa, non c’è niente che riporti a galla le tue debolezze. Un sonno liberatorio e contemporaneamente distruttivo, perché tutto questo ha un prezzo. L’indomani, quando suona la sveglia, Lui è lì, da parte al letto con un grigno meschino. Sa cosa hai visto quella notte e non ti ha interrotta. Il suo compito ora è più facile: basta che tu torni nella realtà per assolvere il Suo compito. Basta che ti alzi per renderti conto che tu le gambe snelle che nuotavano nella barriera corallina non le hai, anzi è meglio che a rana così non ci nuoti, visto che hai un’articolazione andata. Basta che entri in bagno per sostituire a quella cascata di lunghi boccoli un cespuglio di rovi intricati e impossibili, che a malapena arrivano a metà collo. Basta che guardi l’agenda per sostituire quella vita piena ed appagante con un circolo di frustrazione e noia. È in quel momento che Lui si avvicina e ti avvolge nuovamente nelle sue spire, con il risultato di farti buttare giù un caffelatte al volo per uscire a lavorare. Quel lavoro che odi, che non avresti mai voluto fare ma che ti serve per racimolare qualche soldo. Quel lavoro che non ti va giù perché in una famiglia di casalinghe, infermiere/badanti e bidelle hai giurato che saresti stata la prima ad uscire dagli stereotipi femminili che hanno condizionato o almeno, hanno cercato di condizionare, la tua educazione. Quel lavoro che sei stata costretta ad accettare perché ogni volta che hai inviato CV per quello per cui ti sentivi portata avevano appena assunto o volevano solo uomini, che non rimangono incinta e non hanno nessun problema. Quel lavoro che ti imprigiona mentre quello che volevi tu ti avrebbe liberata, concesso una casa tua, una macchina affidabile e la pace che senti di meritarti. Quel lavoro che tutte le mattine e le sere ti fa piangere nel tragitto, perché non è giusto che dopo l’impegno che ci hai messo e tutte le cose a cui hai rinunciato, ti ritrovi ancora più indietro di chi si è visto piombare tutto addosso. O almeno, questo è quello che pensi. Sogni l’estero, ma non hai i soldi neppure per farti emettere il passaporto, figuriamoci permetterti un biglietto aereo ed un affitto in un luogo sconosciuto. Hai sognato la laurea, ma te la sei dovuta pagare e all’80% i datori di lavoro chiedevano ritmi inconciliabili tra studio e lavoro. “Devi scegliere: o uno o l’altro”, ti sei sentita dire varie volte. Col risultato che sono due anni che non dai neppure un esame. Ogni volta che sogni ad occhi aperti e cerchi di fare il possibile per esaudire i tuoi desideri, ecco che uno tsunami di avversità si abbattono sul tuo cammino. Per andare dal punto A al punto B devi arrivare fino alla Z e poi tornare indietro. A metà strada sei esausta. Ti trovi ad invidiare chi riesce a fare tutto senza sforzi e ad odiarti per aver invidiato, perché in fondo sai quanto ti è costato arrivare fino a qui. Queste continue difficoltà ti stancano e spesso arrivi a fine giornata esausta senza un motivo. Non riesci a concentrarti più su niente, sei troppo stanca per seguire anche solo un cartone animato figuriamoci un corso! Questa continua stanchezza ti fa pano piano rimandare tante cose, fino a che non arrivi a rimandare anche i rapporti con gli altri. Non ce la fai a seguire le amicizie, sei troppo stanca per sentire altri problemi — specie quando il tuo partner ne ha tanti, non e la fai a prendere quella conversazione e rispondere a quel messaggio. Ti ritrovi in un isolamento semi volontario, fatto di musica e silenzio, dove non puoi essere paragonata a niente e nessuno, dove ci sei solo tu e le tue cuffie. Mano a mano le amicizie di dissolvono e i partner spariscono con la certezza di essere stati traditi, perché ammettere di non aver visto i segni di cedimento di chi ti sta accanto mentre eri preso da te stesso è una colpa difficile da prendersi. Piano piano anche quelli che vogliono starti vicino perché capiscono che ne hai bisogno, vengono visti in maniera schizofrenica. Da un lato gli vuoi bene, capisci l’importanza dei loro sorrisi e il loro modo di essere presenti allenta un po’ le Sue spire, dall’altro sai che in queste condizioni non riesci a contraccambiare la loro gentilezza e in un mondo ridotto dal tuo pessimismo al mero dare e avere, ti senti sempre in debito quindi vivi questi rapporti con disagio. Quando se ne accorgono, le loro frasi rassicuranti servono solo a farti sentire ancora più in debito perché hanno visto questo tuo disagio e l’hanno compreso. Il circolo dell’autocommiserazione si stringe sempre di più fino a farti vivere male qualunque rapporto. L’isolamento volontario da chi ti vuole bene ti sembra l’unica via. Cancelli i profili social, pieni di gente strafelice che ti fa sentire ancora peggio. Stai coi tuoi animali, che in cambio di cibo e pulizia ti amano senza giudicarti e senza farti sentire in debito. Stanno lì, al bisogno. Inizi a non vedere più niente di bello, qualsiasi cosa è negativa. C’è il sole ma tu hai mal di testa e non te lo puoi godere, potresti andare in piscina a nuotare ma ti vergogni perché sei grassa, vorresti rivedere quel film ma sei stanca e ti addormenteresti a metà, ti piacerebbe sentire quella persona ma sicuramente la disturberesti. I Tg di irritano, qualsiasi frase detta male di fa scattare, non sopporti chi urla e chi si lamenta solamente perché amplifica quello che hai dentro. Non sopporti gli estremisti, non sopporti i convinti, non sopporti gli incompetenti e non sopporti i religiosi. I religiosi però, sono una categoria a parte. Non li sopporti perché, in un periodo di tormento, sono riusciti a spegnere il cervello e le loro mille domande per affidarsi ciecamente a un sogno e da quello trovano risposte e pace. L’hai visto centinaia di volte, nello zio coi tumori morto col sorriso agli amici convertiti. Qualsiasi sia la religione alla quale abbiano aderito, chi ha messo a tacere Lui con qualsiasi divinità ha trovato la pace. Tu, in questo periodo perenne invece trovi insensata anche la scienza, figuriamoci la religione. Quando tenti di avvicinarti alla terapia, ti senti giudicata, inerme, con tutte le tue paure e le tue debolezze esposte. Loro sono lì per curarti come tutti gli altri medici, sanno che hai dei problemi o non saresti lì, ma a te non fa lo stesso effetto. Forse i religiosi hanno preferito la via dell’irrazionalità per non affrontare questo supplizio. Generalmente, quando il terapista tocca dei nervi scoperti hai due reazioni: scoppi a piangere o menti. Senza motivo, ma menti. Lui se ne accorge, ma fa finta di nulla, per ritornarci la seduta dopo. Quella a cui non parteciperai mai. Menti perché, stretta nelle Sue spire e sprofondata nel circolo dell’autocommiserazione ti vergogni, credi di essere un caso umano, l’unica così messa male. In quel momento dimentichi che ci sono persone messe molto peggio, che cercano modi autolesionisti per fuggire da Lui, dal consumo di sostanze al suicidio. In quel momento tu sei la persona più sfigata, brutta, grassa, sola e messa male del mondo. Tutte le percezioni negative sono amplificate, le positive quasi annullate. Un consiglio spesso dato dai terapisti è il dedicare tempo a cose che ti piace fare o all’attività fisica. E’ vero, quando lo fai sei più energica, ti addormenti senza le gocce e non pensi alle tue rogne ma… dura poco. La famosa stanchezza ti fa abbandonare tutto. Dopo tre volte che fai il giro della città in bicicletta, dopo due fotografie scattate, dopo quattro ricerche per organizzare un viaggio low cost in un posto che non hai mai visto tu desisti. Sei troppo stanca e quello che fai normalmente ti succhia già l’esistenza, dove lo trovi altro tempo?",2017
Flores,"¿Como te fue en clases? Luz, agua, y vos enterrando los dedos en mi cabeza. No me detengo para pensar pero todos los pensamientos pasan por mi cabeza. Mientras tanto descansas tus manos en la dulce negligencia, no sos culpable, solo humano. Me gustaría ser igual, comer donde quiera y donde quiera ser comido. Pero prefiero que no lo hagas, me revuelve las entrañas y oscurece mi pecho. Solo. Y en la ola de pensamientos caes con tanta fuerza que irrumpís en mi sistema, catástrofe. Tus manos sucias escriben palabras ciegas en mis brazos y sacudís tu veneno cerca de mis heridas, justo para llenarlas de una sustancia tan negra como tu corazón. Cuanta maldad inconsciente y aún así me quiero comer tu boca. Entre las ruinas de este lugar me pierdo con los árboles. Todos son pálidos y me ven con resentimiento, puede que estén molestos pero en realidad me esperan. No veo más allá de mi nariz, mi ego no me lo permite. Solo si es tu frágil silueta a la distancia que baila pero nunca cerca mío. Rechazo. Entra el vacío sin aviso. Tiendo a sumergirme más de la cuenta en el río de sangre que corre por mis venas, corre rápido. Y más rápido cuando pienso en vos, se tiñe de blanco y luego de negro. Mientras más estás frente a mis ojos más pesado me vuelvo hasta ser denso como el agujero negro en mi frente, cálido y frío, no es agradable. Pero igual no te importa porque ya sabes lo que sigue y yo también lo conozco. Me gustaría cambiarlo pero mis brazos no aguantan y mis pies ya están cansados, solo con tocar tus labios y ya morirme de una vez. Al final soy una caja negra que no comprende la manifestación física de su consciencia. Vos sos eterna, yo dispensable.",2017
Fighting With Myself,"Who else feels like this? Who else feels like you have absolutely no idea what you’re doing? Like all these ideas are crammed in your brain and you can’t figure out which path to follow. I have to fight with myself on a daily basis to stay focused. I tell myself to stick to the path. “You’re growing, Kern. Things are moving forward. You can see the progress.” Then my mind fights back, tells me to turn this way. Tells me there’s another path with more ideas that need chasing. It says I’m spending too much time on this one dream. Sometimes I listen. Sometimes I veer off a little bit, get these crazy notions that there’s something else for me. Some other project. Some other passion. I usually don’t get too far before stopping myself, though. Maybe in the past, my mind would lead me off track. But I’m better now. I’m stronger now. I’m more dialed in to who I am and what I want to do more than ever. Not even my own mind can stop me. I’m actually getting closer to having my mind completely on my side. It doesn’t waiver like this too often anymore. It doesn’t create these roadblocks, tell me lies, try to convince me of things I know aren’t true. My mind is almost my own. I’ve made it show me the way, tap into similar energies and use those to guide my path. Nothing can stop me now, not even myself. The fight continues and I’m not sure it will ever be over. But for now, now I’m winning. “The mind is it’s own place, and in itself can make a heaven of hell, a hell of heaven.” John Milton.

No More “What Ifs”,"I was staring at my ceiling again the other night, and I was very overwhelmed thinking about school and how it is all coming to an end in the next two months or so. Lately I have had very little time to work, but lots of time, apparently, to sit and freak out about all the work that actually needs to be done and text my friends and classmates about how I am constantly silently screaming in fear for my success. Life of a design student. On top of this however, I have been dealing with a personal issue of mental illness. I have a bit of a collection: general anxiety disorder, panic disorder, depression, and OCD tendencies. It’s only been recently that I have been able to talk about it and open up about these things. I would be lying if I wasn’t terrified of the social repercussions if there are any, and I would also be lying if I said these issues didn’t have an effect on my creative process and overall confidence as a designer as well as a person. As you may guess, having these mental inconveniences doesn’t exactly make it easy to design a killer portfolio piece or talk to industry professionals while I am desperately trying to fit into the creative community. Lately the one thing I have been stuck on imaging is me standing there looking stupid in front of my work at the final graduation show from my program, and throwing up from the tension while massive amounts of people walk by and look at my work and potentially disliking it. Thoughts run rampant like, “What if I never get a job? What if I am not meant to be a designer? What if no one likes my work? What if everyone around me is better and I’m the worst one in the class?” What if, what if, what if… There is always a point during one of my freak-outs over projects that I am able to pull myself together and remind myself of something that I have to say almost every day: I am better than that. I am better than dwelling on things that are classified as “what ifs”. Sometimes I need a little bit of a push in order to get myself over that hump, but when I do, I always come back swinging. Sometimes it just takes a little longer for me to bring up the courage to pull myself through a breakdown, especially when it feels like you are going through this particular (and what seems to be never-ending) battle alone. I suppose what I am trying to get at is to not let yourself be controlled by “what ifs”. As creatives, we have so much power inside of us that we all have the ability to change the world. We shouldn’t feel intimidated or worried about what other people think about our work. As long as we can confidently stand next to it and back it up, you have nothing to worry about. Own it. Be proud that you have come so far to make something like this and no other thing exists in the world that is exactly like what you have just created. Be proud! Lastly, for the other creatives who have the same struggles with mental illness as me, you are not your illness. You battle every single day and use your energy to create beautiful things to share with the world around you on a regular basis. You literally open up your imagination and passions and lay it into print, web, writing, or however you feel is the best way to express yourself. Never forget that you are talented. Never forget that you are not your struggles. Never forget that you are not the only person who feels this way. Never forget that you are amazing. We are all in this together, so no more ‘what ifs’, ok?",2017
Can I? Can You?,"In a season of transition, this can be such a hard thing. Where will I be in a few months? Will I like it? Will I be happy? I literally have no idea, and I do not mean in the sense that none of us know what the future may bring, but I mean, beyond that, in a far more practical way. I graduate Duke, pending no surprises, in May. Then what? I am on the track to be licensed to minister by the United Methodist Church. I have no idea where I will be. It is scary. It is uncomfortable. For a person who struggles with anxiety and panic disorder, this is not easy. My supervisor suggested I live into a prayer of the Methodist founder, John Wesley. See below. Can I pray it? Can I actually pray this and mean it? Can you? I am no longer my own, but thine. Put me to what thou wilt, rank me with whom thou wilt. Put me to doing, put me to suffering. Let me be employed for thee or laid aside for thee, exalted for thee or brought low for thee. Let me be full, let me be empty. Let me have all things, let me have nothing. I freely and heartily yield all things to thy pleasure and disposal. And now, O glorious and blessed God, Father, Son and Holy Spirit,thou art mine, and I am thine.So be it.And the covenant which I have made on earth,let it be ratified in heaven.Amen.",2017
I’m Not What You See,"I’ve set up walls to blockade my heart from the pain of the world. I’ve worn masks to fake feelings I’ve never really had. I’ve closed doors to everything to stray from disappointment of my own expectations. I’ve ran from my past, from fear of facing it again in the future. I’m not what you see, this face isn’t mine. I’m not who I once was, not what I believe I should be, or even how I want to become. I’m everything I feared I could be, man walking in the darkness, cold, and alone. My heart aches daily, even with the mask of a smile. I’m not what you see, this face isn’t mine. How far does this go, the agony inside? The darkness, the emptiness, and coldness is like a plague upon my heart and soul in a universe so vast. I’m tied to a demon, a darkness the light can’t destroy. I’m not what you see, this face isn’t mine. I’m shackled to chains of fear and pain, where my heart isn’t free. Imaginations and dreams of brightened skies, dimmed so much by such fright. I’m not what you see, this face isn’t mine. Fake smiles to everyone with tears draining from my eyes. Words so bright, yet actions lack to express. Paths so dark, yet knowledge so great. Where I step are dagger-like stones, not meant for walking. I’m not what you see, this face isn’t mine. I’ve worn masks to fake feelings I’ve never really had.",2017
4 Tips to Know Your Anxiety Disorder is Not Just Normal Worry,"There are many more people struggling with anxiety than you can possibly imagine. The dangerous thing about anxiety is that it can present itself in a huge range that goes from mild and perfectly controllable anxiety to the kind of feeling that can drive you nuts.

Social Anxiety Disorder and the Neural Link,"Psychology Today sheds new light on the topic of social anxiety with a new study from the National Institute of Mental Health. The research compared brain scans of people with anxiety disorder and those without it; and the results revealed some surprising facts about the neural roots of this type of disorder. According to the Social Anxiety Institute in the United States, “Social anxiety is the fear of interaction with other people that brings on self-consciousness, feelings of being negatively judged and evaluated, and, as a result, leads to avoidance.” Someone who is socially anxious is afraid of what others may think. He may be afraid of appearing inferior or inadequate, and he may be terrified of embarrassment and humiliation. Because of these fears, the person may suffer greatly before a social situation occurs, or she may avoid the situation altogether. Some social anxiety is normal for human beings, but when it becomes irrational and excessive, affecting normal life and behaviour, it is a disorder. Social anxiety disorder is common in many countries. In the United States, it is the third largest psychological disorder, following close behind depression and alcoholism. In a heavily populated city-state like Singapore, suffering from social anxiety disorder can be acutely painful. It is difficult to find peace when so many other people are eating, studying, working, and walking in the same space. The U.S. National Institute of Mental Health initiated their study of social anxiety disorder based on the idea that a person’s fears begin in early childhood. As part of the study, participants watched animated characters exhibit four different reactions to a strange creature. Next, the participants were shown the creature themselves. During both phases, the researchers recorded the participants’ brain activation patterns. None of the participants knew the true purpose of the study; they were asked about the animated character’s gender, and they had to indicate whether or not they would go closer to the creature or stay away from it. The most interesting findings resulted from readings in the amygdala portion of the brain. Participants with social anxiety disorder showed heightened activation in that area of the brain while watching the animated faces, especially when the faces showed negative emotions. The scans showed an unusual level of sensitivity to fear reactions in other people’s faces. Fortunately, people with social anxiety disorder can improve significantly through observational learning and therapy. Conditioning and altering fear reactions is possible with time and with careful treatment under the supervision of a psychiatrist in Singapore. After modifying and softening those fear responses through therapy, people may eventually become more comfortable in social situations. Do you struggle daily with the fear of new situations or unfamiliar settings? Are you crippled by the fear of what others may think of you, or the fear that you’ll do something wrong or embarrassing? If these social anxieties are taking over your life, you need help from a top psychologist in Singapore. At Adelphi Psych Medicine Clinic, you’ll find caring, experienced professionals who understand your condition. We’ll help you work through those fears so that you can have a happier, richer life.

Overcoming Depression Part 12,"Needless to say, I survived. Turns out, I wasnt very good at killing myself. I wound up going to the day hospital program, and slowly improved… I have discovered that my struggles with depression amounted to my fear of losing certain things…and, my solution to depression turned out to be adding certain things.",2017
Peaked,"For me, height/success is not what it might be to some (lots of money, possessions, fame, world travel), it is simply, to be recognized for my work (my writing in this case). Inevitably, recognition requires that people will turn towards you, expect you to actually put down your laptop, leave the house (in something other than yoga pants), clear your throat and speak. You see, my fear of heights is not all that far up the mountain. Climbing is good for people, it gets the heart rate up. Right? I used to live in the mountains. While still in the trees, hiking along with friends, chatting, and wondering how long it would take us to reach the Big View, I was content. There were breaks, snacks and the occasional dive into the woods for a pee. Closer to the top, the trees got smaller, hardy little things that lean as if buffeted by strong winds, even on a calm day; a signpost of what life is like at those altitudes. Further up the mountain, there were fewer of them. Closer to the top, the trees got smaller, hardy little things that lean as if buffeted by strong winds, even on a calm day; a signpost of what life is like at those altitudes. Less and less living things populate the land of rock and snow, until the pointy bit (feel free to envision The Grinch here, peering down from the mouth of his cave with his drooping dog at his side). Here, scrambling is necessary, maybe even some colorful ropes and shiny metal clips (ooooh shiny things!). The wind pushes harder now, get down, get down you silly thing. And here is where I halt, and remember who I am, and that I belong among trees, where I am not taller than other things, where there are small, furry creatures and singing birds. I don’t need the Big View, I’ve seen it from another angle. I don’t need to see it all it once, I prefer life in vignettes anyway. Go on without me. Snap a photo. Vertigo, nausea, deep longing for a comfortable chair and a book. And here is where I halt, and remember who I am, and that I belong among trees, where I am not taller than other things, where there are small, furry creatures and singing birds. Then why come this far? All that plodding along with the dim hope of reaching something so close to the clouds should amount to something, screams my brain. But it’s not my mind that’s in charge up here, it’s the body that drops to the ground shivering, threatening digestive revolt and blackouts, if it must. I have been known to get a bit shrieky near the top of the mountain, to cling in a most unbecoming way. But it’s not the peak that looms now, it’s the podium (or lectern); me, standing while others sit, speaking while others listen. And, I reiterate, I’m not talking about an international bestseller here, my first novel will probably sell modestly in this corner of the country, IF things go well. Still, there is an official contract and it says (in legal-ese) that I shall go forth and speak to people to promote The Work. Author requires emotional guide dog to accompany her at all public appearances. I wonder if I can bring my dog. That would help. Should I pencil that in the margins? Author requires emotional guide dog to accompany her at all public appearances. I always had a dog on the mountain. Instead of a podium, I’d have a couch and read to my audience while stroking my dog’s velvety ear. Scratch that, my dog is in the habit of jumping on people and stealing their mittens (this is Canada). The Reading would become The Apology. It’s okay, this time I’ll make it beyond the treeline. I promise that I won’t scream or throw up. This is what I wanted (!) and others have walked beside me this far, I can’t let them down. What is the worst that can happen? I could fall/fail. No, that’s not the worst, is it? That’s expected. The worst, I suppose is to stagnate, plop myself down and move no further. Okay, here goes.",2017
I’m suffocating myself,"Colleagues at work have this and that, children to care for and important meetings and home maintenance disasters and it all seems more important, more urgent, than whatever I have going on, so of course I will do this shift, and this one too. Friends want to meet, the boyfriend arranges meetings and it’s understood I’ll be there, and of course I want to, because I want to be more open, I want to be there, I don’t want to be this person who stays on the sofa behind closed curtains, binge watching whatever stupid show has grabbed my attention. Then there’s exercise, I want to do more of it, because my ass is getting huge and I don’t want to be out of breath whenever I climb a flight of stairs. And I want to try out a fun class, I promised myself that at the beginning of the year, it’s part of my goals: get out of my comfort zone, do something new. It’s a constant, non-stop, drip drip drip of do that, do this, be here, be there. My calendar is full full full of those colorful stickers that I use, no one could tell me I’m not busy, no one could tell me I’m not trying. And I all want to do is scream. Please, leave me alone. Please, leave me be. Where’s the time for myself? When can I read, when can I write, when can I dream? And when can I, yes, binge-watch whatever dumb show I choose? I want to be better better better, do more more more, and instead of feeling successful, accomplished and satisfied, I feel suffocated. I scramble for solutions, because that’s who I am, that’s what I do: I find solutions. Move this meeting there, go first to this party and then to this other, meet X for lunch and Y for dinner and Z for drinks, of course I can, I mean, it’s been a bit of a hectic week, but I do want to see them, of course I do, and I have a free hour after all… Free hours in my calendar make me feel guilty. Like I’m not working hard enough, like I’m not trying. Maybe if I don’t go to this party I won’t be invited to the next one. Maybe they’ll talk about me, she never comes anymore, she isn’t really making an effort isn’t she. You can’t count on her, so sad. And all I want do do is breathe. I know it’s not like that, no one will talk about me behind my back, and I can take the time, it’s mine. Why, then, is it so hard? Why does that breath don’t come to me. Why don’t I let it in?",2017
A Letter to My Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD),"Dear Generalized Anxiety Disorder, Trumpeting that you and I, Genie, are on a first-name basis like a burnished brass instrument amidst a melodious symphony is, admittedly, an underestimation of our codependency. I remember being introduced to you — the beginning of my end. I had always been acquainted with your tidal waves — recurrent hurricanes devastating my intertwining villages, the framework being dilapidated one, two, three times over, one following another suit like a controlled demolition — and as a result, you weren’t a textbook outlander. You bore this hardhearted familiarity, like that coronated high school monarch you catch wind of, yet bestow your best attempt to evade throughout the corridors. Your stampede throughout my African savannah oftentimes constituted the conventional wildebeests of terror-stricken hyperventilating, gazelles of erratic rationalizing, and lionesses of blistering teardrops of sorrowing. Although you had been a cyclical matinée heretofore, nothing would’ve rehearsed me for center stage, my individual deprecation headlining within the crestfallen limelight. My eventide that day was orchestrated without reinvigorating slumber, myself the puppet of a celestial ventriloquist. My mother had prevailed from a dire operation unto her spine, and my sleepless gears were pirouetting within my subconscious. That autumnal twilight would be hallowed within Chinese dishes and the plush furniture of the cinema, myself venturing to eradicate the Roman ruins of disquietude suffocating me; a consecrated acreage of quintessential human experience. I was incarcerated into an aftermath: my leading anxiety attack. The tarnishing iron bars and cinderblock walls environing me were menacing within their imprisonment, my cognizance hastily becoming disjointed from my corporeality. I remember being petrified of my reflection glowering with disappointment and anguish back at me. I remember my bodily joints smoldering with trepidation, my lungs inflating and deflating with sporadic rhythm contradistinctive to the unfaltering tempo of a metronome. I remember phoning my afflicted mother with innumerable electronic chiming, my sentences like a broken record; “I feel like I’m dying”, “I think I’m going mad”, “I’ve forgotten how to breathe”. Ensuing what I irrefutably had determined had been a millennia, but was a mere half an hour to forty-five minutes, I copped some Z’s, extraordinarily fatigued from the incessant apprehension. When I awoke, my azure eyes haggard in the way only mental illness can wreak upon your psyche, I professed to myself that I would “diverge into a yellow wood” of quiescence. What had transpired had resolved, and I took that as gospel. Much to my dismay, this was not prolonged. Since that tormented dusk, Genie, you and I have underwent therapy appointments, psychiatric consultations, and a myriad of antidepressants and anti-anxiety medications, from Prozac to Cymbalta to Buspirone and Zoloft. We have succumbed to exasperating insomnia, and we have been diseased with a pathogen of mortifying nightmares and intrusive thoughts. We have contemplated self-mutilation as a coping mechanism, and we have sustained conflagrant flesh within the fortification of our lungs as we drown — like when we would catapult ourselves from the docks at the tepid lake throughout that hazy summertime — amongst a vehement sea of a crowd. We have blundered at academic assignments from the unmotivated personality you exhibit, and we have tolerated one another’s influences throughout assessments, inclusive of the presentiment of inadequacy and rejection. You and I have amalgamated into a backwoods soul; into the statistic that 3.1% of the United States’s population will be a martyr to Generalized Anxiety Disorder. The statistic that 5% of Americans between twelve and nineteen years of age employ antidepressants. The statistic that 13% of juveniles will make a run at and/or envisage self-harming. It’s bittersweetly mystifying when you’re vacant from the construction of the hustle and bustle of the daily grind. Astonishingly, the exploration of existentialism throughout the Milky Way Galaxy without you provokes a “naked” sensation, like when the springtide erupts throughout the atmosphere, and gradually, you’re able to sport your preferred sundress again as opposed to your previously denim-clad legs. You feel alive. You feel alive and nothing else. Genie, albeit you have induced the uttermost melancholy of three AM hours within the plagued marrow of my bones — you have acculturated me to what it authentically means to be a humanoid entity upon Mother Earth. To appreciate every blade of grass that blossoms from the earthen soil. To love those who are hardest to love. To forgive the ocean for washing away what I had surmised I needed. In spite of this, it’s throughout this concurrent eight hundred words of acknowledgment to you that I’m disembarking upon letting you go. You will everlastingly be alongside me, and I will everlastingly be alongside you — but I must flourish like a willow within a foliating timberland. I must live, and with your fingertips asphyxiating me, I’m incapacitated from myself. I’m impuissant within my interpersonal relationships, for you customarily take the reigns and drive me into the ground. I’m inefficacious artistically, for the whimsicality I once upon a time enshrined within the fibers of my pulsating heart, I now forage for fragments of. Simplistically, I’m not the unparalleled adaptation of myself. I’m not what I necessitate to be all of the characteristics I yearn to breathe and bleed for.I will be her someday within the impending morrow. Even if you are there, too. Love always, Your adversary and companion, Alexandria G. Piette",2017
Support and balance in fighting the Demons,"The demons within have been well hidden for a long time, which at times does a swell job at putting me in an anxious state. These triggers? I don’t know what they are, but when do come and panic comes in. That’s when you lose the sense of control, the sense of control you once had. Now you somehow face a switch from a logical to an illogical mental state and that this predisposition makes you wonder when things are ok, how you might have gotten there. There, is where you break it down — and not hide from it and once you face these demons face fronts regardless of which, you slowly find you way back to life and maintaining a balance on all levels. I’ve been lucky with the support I’ve had, whether it was holding myself up in my room trying to repeated fight physical and mental duress I faced. It’s going to be okay, and that’s because day to day. I’ve managed to create a balance, with the help and unprecedented support of my friends. Here, this is where I want to tell everyone, if you ever find yourself in this position — seek solace in friends but remember to choose those that you know will stick by you no matter what, irrespective if you have the darkest thoughts. Help from others can help.",2017
Am I sleeping or am I awake?,"[Not a story | just a realization] Sleeping or waking up. Now I somehow know the difference so that I can be more conscious of it in future. Sleeping is just not sleeping in literal sense. It also includes other activities when we do not acknowledge the reality around us and thus fail to live in the present, in other words, we sleep. Sleeping is day dreaming and wishful thinking. Sleeping is burying ourselves in the past. Sleeping is indulging in fantasy like watching a movie or reading a novel. Sleeping is worrying about something over which we do not have control. Sleeping is seeking something and not knowing exactly what like the existential questions. Sleeping is trying to figure out everything despite not having information. Sleeping is thinking. While sleeping consists of all the above, waking up is just using the five senses and accepting and seeing reality as it is right now, in the moment.",2017

Overcoming Depression Part 13,I spent about 3.5 months in the day hospital program. It was there that I discovered the first of my solutions to depression…I needed to ADD community.,2017
The Sad is Winning,"This is not typically a challenge for me. I typically enjoy working out because it makes me feel good. But I’ve been struggling lately. I’ve been trying hard not to fall into the funk, but its call is always so tempting in the winter months, especially February. A sign of depression is that you no longer do the things that you normally enjoy doing. And while that accurately describes my position right now, it’s so much more complicated than that. I still want to do the things I enjoy. I just don’t want to do them. Ya know? That’s probably confusing. Let me try again… I still want to do the things I enjoy (in theory). I just don’t have the motivation to do them (in practice). Lack of motivation, not loss of interest, is the real problem. I recently wrote about being happy, and that wasn’t bullshit. I do find myself in moments of happiness and, overall, I am happier more often than I used to be, but happy is not a constant. There is a continuous, ongoing battle between high and low, happy and sad, and right now, the sad is winning. I’m not even really sure of the source of this feeling (which is pretty characteristic of the funk). It’s a vague, foggy sadness that follows me, like the dust cloud surrounding Pig-Pen. I get the sense that people sense it, but they don’t know what to say. “Are you okay?” they’ll ask. “Yeah, okay as ever,” I say. And that’s true. But it’s true that I’m also sad. It is possible to be okay and sad at the same time. The problem is that when I feel this way, I sit on my couch and do nothing for hours on end, unless you consider binge-watching Netflix doing more than nothing, which I don’t. There are other things I want to be doing, things I should be doing, but I just can’t do them. And then I feel bad for not doing them. And then that makes me want to do nothing even more. I don’t know what to do about this feeling besides ride it out. It’ll pass in time, I know. Sometimes I even like having quiet time to reflect, but not so much this time around. For some reason, this time, I feel angry that I feel this way again. I just want to go back to feeling good and I can’t make that happen by magic, so, instead, I ignore things. I ignore messages, I ignore Slack, I ignore writing, I ignore email, I ignore work, I ignore as much of the world as I can while I crawl in a hole and feel sorry for myself for feeling this way. So, this piece is my 52-Week Writing Challenge piece this week, folks, and I’m sorry about that because it’s not what I said I’d write. It’s not even what I want to write. I want to do the thing I said I would, I want to write the writing I enjoy, but this is all I can churn out at the moment: literally typing away in my car as a confession, an apology, and a means to avoid the treadmill. I was late in publishing my Challenge pieces the past two weeks, and given that the clock currently reads 12:23 AM as I finish editing this, I’m late again. If nothing else, I am consistent in my slackery lateness. (And somehow that’s a source of pride?) So, give me a free pass this time and maybe a little while longer, please. Winter is almost over and I’ll find my normal self again, I’m sure. Right now, though, I am not that self, and I’m starting to miss her.",2017
I Thought Wanderlust Was Overrated,"Stepping out of your comfort zone is hard, at least for me, it was. I was that person who took art classes and quit after a few weeks, and tennis classes that I’d make excuses not to attend. In this bubble of anxiety, there was no break from the ‘usual’ let alone place for adventure. So obviously, when people talked about travelling, discovering new places and even themselves, I closed my ears and mind to the idea of it. How does one sit in a train and make it about setting off to discover yourself? Pff. Pretentious little kids. This was until I had one of the most emotionally taxing years of my life, at a time when my carefully planned life seemed to be going haywire. I was not where I wanted to be, or even who I wanted to be. Compartmentalizing my life into boxes, some even marked ‘Never open, ever.’ because my schedule had no time for a breakdown had unraveled, and for once, I had no idea what to do. And I once again, fell into the familiar hands of sleeping, binge watching & eating — of habit. This was also the time that after many failed trip plans that are copyright of Every College Student Ever, and I suddenly found myself wanting to travel. For the past three years, my life had been about the monotony of 6 am mornings, and late nights working on projects, and I wanted to get out. I’d heard travel stories that were spontaneous, unplanned and fun, complete with aesthetic pictures of yoga poses on mountains (that I had no intention of attempting due to my history of falling down.) and VSCO edited streets of a town whose name I, with all my pretend eloquence could not pronounce. In other words, the complete opposite of everything I’d done so far. So I packed my bags and set off to a place that was completely new, and one missed flight later, I found myself at the airport for the next 7 hours. Memory Proximity Mine (n) — A sight, scent and/or sound that when encountered explodes into a rush of emotions. Sometimes painful. Sometimes pleasant. Sometimes both. Mine. Sitting at that airport, a song about backseats of rovers (that I’d made my mission to dislike) playing through the speakers, surrounded by people just like me, but different too. Feeling free. Alive.And every time I hear that song again, I remember how it felt to hear my heart beat, to know it was there. In those 10 days, I experienced waking up in the morning, not knowing what the day would bring, and stepped out of my cocoon, even if it was just the slightest bit and hear the stories of people I’d never met, to feel free, in control and excited all at the same time. I felt that freedom that everyone talks about, when they pack their bags and head off to a new place to find a little something new about themselves, from within themselves. And while that vacation wasn’t the best I’ve ever been on, it was a unique experience of letting go, and holding on all at the same time. It was about sitting in a hospital in a city far away from yours (Remember the falling problem I talked about?), or sitting at the airport with a woman is completely different to you and giving amateur reviews about a popular Bollywood actress’ debut novel (We decided it was a one time read, and both left with novel writing aspirations.), or about lying on the grass for hours, looking at clouds and wondering what the exact procedure to built a home on one would be (I know, there isn’t one.), about sitting in an auto-rickshaw (Those small yellow vehicles you all are so fascinated by.) driven by a woman, in a country where such a thing is unheard of, and about feeling the air enter your lungs when you laugh with your sister on a cool winter evening. It was about knowing that life cannot be compartmentalized all the time and that the best part about life is that even when it seems to be falling apart, you can go back and start again. It was about I, the cynic, finding myself.",2017
Navigating anxiety with an eating disorder,"For me, disordered eating and anxiety are intertwined. They feed off of each other until I am hollow. It’s a parasitic emptiness, one that consumes your every thought and action until you are emotionally void. The cycle is cruel — anxiety begets restriction and shame; restriction and shame beget anxiety. Ignored, the combination can easily spiral into depression. We’re kicking off NEDAwareness Week with the root of my eating disorder: Anxiety. When I’m feeling anxious, I turn to pen and paper for comfort. This was one of those times. The following was written during a bout of anxiety earlier this year. I should have gone to bed earlier, but I never do. The weight of the world becomes exceptionally heavy right around 10 p.m. The problems, the fears, the anxiety — they entangle me. I stare at the wall across the room and shift uncomfortably. I sink down into the cushion, staring, thinking. It feels as though pieces from five different puzzles are swirling within my mind, each trying — yet failing — to connect. I eventually break my stare and pull myself off the couch. I brew some chamomile, hoping to lull myself to sleep, and make a list of the things I need to do. Laundry, bills, call the grandparents, go to Target, find a therapist, write that blog you’ve been meaning to write. I set it aside (with the six other lists I’ve made this week) and crawl into bed. I pull the covers around me, eyes barely exposed, and breathe a slow, deep sigh. I continue my stare, fixated on the ceiling’s shadows. The cerebral fog begins to dissipate. My mind bounces from emotion to emotion — dread at the idea of repeating today, excitement for the week’s trail run quickly followed by an instinctual social anxiety. A craving to just be alone. I stare a little while longer and eventually roll over, reaching for my mug. I take a long sip, turn out the light, and return my gaze to the darkened ceiling. The tea was cold. I hate feeling this way. This “I’m going to listen to the same four Lorde songs on repeat and lay on the floor” feeling. I’m experiencing life through a pair of smudged, cloudy glasses, and my typically optimistic and bright perspective now has a hazy, blurred lens. Everything just feels hard. Things I normally enjoy — making dinner, weekly group runs, journaling — become laborious and taxing. The smallest grain of sand is enough to uproot my entire existence. I’m not sure what led to this — stints of anxiety, the occasional bad day, uncertainty regarding my future — small things, sure, but not enough to lead to this sinking, darkening feeling. I recognize bits and pieces of this lens: the desire to run away (and the increased weekly mileage in an attempt to do so), the same Spotify playlist, the increased social anxiety and desire to isolate myself, the self-criticism and body shaming — but some things are new and difficult to navigate. The increased heart rate and shortness of breath, the periodic (and inopportune) bouts of tears, sometimes losing visual and mental focus, dreading the everydayness of my still-new routine. I am craving change, not necessarily in scenery (although that seems like the quick and easy fix), but in purpose. I feel listless and disengaged. Mediocre and unmotivated. I hate this feeling. I’ve tried to run away from myself before. Many times. Every so often I become incredibly uncomfortable in my own skin. It scratches like cheap wool and wrinkles in all the wrong places. I am displaced within myself. Anxiety creeps in, and I crave an easy out. Isolation. Restriction. Obsessive tendencies. A dangerous cocktail of criticism and control becomes my coping mechanism. Anxiety tightens its grip and, in return, I tighten mine — disordered eating, obsessive exercising, social unease, and loneliness. I desperately want an out, to be free from myself. To run away. But no matter where I go, no matter how far I run, I take myself with me.",2017
ANXIETY IN SPORT AND YOUTH ATHLETES,"Many athletes suffer from anxiety. This week at everactiv our guest blogger, youth runner Ellie , talks about her experiences and we get some expert advice from sports psychologist Tony Westbury. “Today I really wanted to talk about something I have avoided so far on my blog despite it being possibly the main reason I started my blog “Energised Ellie” in the first place — dealing with anxiety and how it affects me in running and how I plan to overcome this. But first, a little bit of backstory… I have always been competitive but about a year into secondary school, my desire to achieve suddenly expanded. I got my first 100% on a test and, since then, I have been adamant about scoring highly on every single exam. At its worst, I would be very disappointed if I did not get the highest mark or get upset if I didn’t get 100%. I would study as hard as I could because, in my mind, if I was good, I wanted to be the best. The same applied for running. I started running around the same time my perfectionism in school started and I was improving rapidly. I would run hard single day and every Saturday and Sunday I would smash my parkrun PBs — it was great! Until I hit an absolute wall. I was no longer improving. Every week I would try for a good time and just end up crying for ages over the result. This started to affect my performance to the point where I would tense up and my breathing would rise. It would make me more likely to give up when someone over-took me. I was doing everything I could think of to improve: I ate super healthily, I joined a running club, I researched constantly but I still didn’t get that magic PB. It was awful. Eventually the time came for me to start competing and immediately I was hit with the reality of how advanced my competitors were. Most of the girls I would run against were experienced club runners and I wasn’t. The races were harder than I had ever done and I wasn’t as high up as I thought I should have been. Part of this was because of my anxiety. It got so bad that in one race, I was forced to drop out because I was exhausted and panicking because a person I usually beat was right behind me. That is the main issue. No matter how hard I try, it is difficult not to compare myself to other people. I have smashed PBs and I am a much better runner but I still get anxious. I no longer breakdown during or afterwards but I do get stressed if one of my rivals is nearby or, even worse — way ahead. As soon as I arrive at a race I point out everyone who looks fast and cower in fear. It would honestly probably be better if I could just run with a blindfold! Sometimes it affects my training. My coach always notices it: my shoulders come up, my stride shortens, my breathing quickens and I tense up which does not help me run fast. I know it needs to be overcome as it holds me back and takes away a lot of the enjoyment of running. So, I have decided to make it my project to improve my running mentality and my anxiety in general. First I am going to try to just run for the love of running. I can’t pretend I don’t spend time analysing results and I must admit that I do memorise quite a lot of them. I am going to try and stop doing this and simply run for myself (although this will be a massive hurdle for me). “Run your own race” is what they all say and that’s what I’ll try to do! I am also going to do more relaxation activities and spend more time relaxing because I have a very contradictory mindset in which relaxing tends to stress me out but I am working on it! I hope you enjoyed this slightly different blog post! I’ll definitely keep you all updated on my anxiety progress and how I am going combat it! During this Saturday’s race, I am going to focus on relaxation by using techniques such as counting in my head to 100 (which has previously worked well for me) and repeating mantras — wish me luck! Ellie xx Tony, our expert sports psychologist, read Ellie’s blog and provides this advice: This is a case which I have seen many times. It’s complicated because perfectionist thinking around performance develops over time, often as a result of motivational climate around the young performer. Small, subtle things around self-worth become internalised and linked to performance outcomes. The scenario Ellie describes is very common — she is training hard and responds well, her performance increases dramatically and she gets great positive feedback: Satisfaction from improving and the drive to keep going. However, the human body doesn’t have an infinite capacity to keep improving at the same rate. At some point the adaptations get smaller and less clear cut — although, ironically, much more important! For example, there is less than 1% difference between 1st and 8th in an Olympic final. The first thing that I would suggest for Ellie is that we look at her expectations. Expecting perfection in every race or training session is unrealistic. Being your very best or perfect every time you perform is rare and gives you a very narrow target to try and meet (see the white box below). When it does’t happen you can get demotivated and upset. Aiming for optimal performance (the gold box) is more realistic. What is the best for you on that day? Did you enjoy it? Was it worth doing? Did you try your best? How can you improve next time? Once or twice a season you may reach a “perfect” performance, but most of the time you might be good, great, or excellent. Making gradual improvements is the key to being excellent in the long term. The second thing that we can look at is comparison. Comparing yourself against the performance of others can be the root of many people’s anxiety. This happens because: Comparison can lead to us avoiding potentially valuable learning experiences. For example, at an open track meeting would you rather be in the middle of the pack in the A race, or easily win the B race? Which race would be more valuable for learning and improving? You may not win the A race, but you could learn new race tactics and skills from better athletes. Benchmarking yourself against yourself is a more useful and psychologically healthy approach — did you deliver the best performance that you could on that day? Where can you improve next time? You can’t control your competitors performances, but you can take full control of your own performances. Elite sport is not full of the best performers — its full of those who didn’t burnout, get injured or become disillusioned. Aiming for your optimal performance can give you the mindset for this journey. everactiv co-founder Cat Morrison is a multiple World Champion in the sport of duathlon and comments: “One of the things that was important for me was focussing on my own race, putting all the things that I had done in training into practice. If I did all this on race day then I would be as happy finishing middle of the pack as I was if I finished first.” Tony’s research interests include sport psychology interventions for performance, and behavioural change/exercise psychology.

The power of groups,"There are groups running up and down the country covering many areas and hobbies from parenting, reading to walking etc, all of which can bring benefit to one's mental health in terms of reducing isolation and feeling supported. So why are groups that actually focus on mental wellbeing in more detail not as common place? Stigma surrounding mental health is an obvious reason. But this is reducing, and increasingly people are being more open and talking aloud about mental health. So let’s have more proactive positive groups to facilitate this momentum further and actually provide a tangible response for the increased demand that proceeds the growing insight we have as a nation into how mental health is effecting us personally. NHS services are struggling with the demand from individuals who have got to crisis levels of distress. Facilitated group chats offer a simple, straightforward much needed vehicle to provide the preventative and early intervention measures we need to stop maladaptive coping strategies taking hold and resulting in a sense of crisis before help is sought. As a community mental health nurse involved in facilitating groups for a leading charity I see first hand the benefits of this on a weekly basis. It takes strength to be open and display vulnerability in front of others but the result can be transformative. Raw, open and honest discussions brings out the bravery in yourself and others, fuelling inspiring and empowering debate and a sense that we can have control over our mental wellbeing. The notion that there is no magic wand to solve mental health issues but instead a bag of tools that need to be identified, practised and reflected upon lends itself to a group brainstorm approach. What works for you, what doesn’t? Why? What are the triggers, barriers? Positive, goal orientated sessions can bring emotionally fuelled change. The feeling that you’re not alone in your struggles, and there are things that can work, helps to put yourself in the driving seat of your thoughts and emotions. And with your own support team sharing ideas and struggles, it is empowering and comforting in equal measure. www.nowandafterwards.com",2017
Getting over social anxiety,"When I was younger I was really shy around kids my age, and most of my friends wouldn't really notice because I was the bigger personality in my group. Dancing really helped me get over that awkward hump of shyness.It still takes me a while to get completely comfortable around people but being up on stage, dancing, has changed how I act completely. I used to not be able to walk into class late because of all the people looking, I’d actually have anxiety attacks about it and break down. But dancing changed everything, if you have a problem with social anxiety I highly suggest getting involved in something whether it be dance, or acting, or debate. Something that will push you to get out of your comfort zone.",2017
3 Ways to Reduce Anxiety Through Mindfulness,http://norinevanderhooven.com/reduce-anxiety-through-mindfulness/blog,2017
Intersectional Privilege:,"It’s an anomaly for an Asian-American, especially a Filipino, to end up in a psychiatric hospital. In Filipino culture, mental illness doesn’t really exist. Growing up, when I told my family I was sad about something, they would reply, “What’s there to be sad about? You live in a nice home, get fed every day, and your parents give you everything.” That was true. But I don’t think they realized the toll that the Asian-American standard of perfection took on me. By social law, I needed to have high grades, a skinny body, and a hyper-masculine, brawny persona. At almost every family party, aunts and uncles would pinch my stomach as banter to make me feel bad for being overweight. I was made fun of by my cousins and peers at school for having a feminine personality, which caused me to feel embarrassed and closeted as a gay teenager. The one thing I could achieve as a child was my high grades, which was particularly accompanied by my sharp critical thinking and writing skills. This is a talent I’m proud of to this day. On top of excelling in school throughout my freshman year of college, I managed to get into typical trouble with drugs and sex. I experimented a few times with weed and hooked up with several men I’d met on Grindr, a popular gay dating app. It wasn’t until I experienced a combination of a terrible high and a traumatic sexual assault that the severe depression, anxiety, and most frighteningly, psychosis drove me to insanity. Sometimes I saw spirits. Some came in the form of divine figures, like a ghost puppy in my childhood home or a foggy robin at the university arboretum. But most of them appeared when I was depressed, and they appeared as demons: floating shadow figures that escorted me to class or crawling humanoids at the slope of a hill. When my depression got really severe, I’d see images of myself slashing my throat and hear voices yelling, “KILL YOURSELF!” Eventually, I ended up in the emergency room, and a crisis nurse put me on a 51/50 hold, which meant that I was to be sent to the psychiatric hospital for at least 72 hours. When I arrived at the hospital, the Filipino staffers were astonished by my admission. “Why are you here? Is this a mistake?” the phlebotomist asked me as I cried and yelled that I wanted to die so I could stop seeing and hearing things. Apparently, Filipinos are supposed to be the staff in psychiatric hospitals, not the patients. Apparently, Filipinos are supposed to be the staff in psychiatric hospitals, not the patients. There was a stigmatic humiliation, especially toward my parents, to have their Filipino-American son end up in a psych ward. On the flip side, because I shared the same race with many of the Filipino staff, I was treated with more respect and sympathy. I would get extra attention, more time to talk out my problems, and even personal gifts like special soap and shampoo from the staff. They told me to distance myself from the other patients, saying that all they talk about is nonsense and that they’re “crazy”. But wasn’t I crazy, too? I couldn’t distance myself from the other patients for too long. We attended the same therapy sessions in order to show improvement so we could get discharged. During one of the sessions, I made friends with a Latina girl who was also a freshman in college, which made me feel like my situation wasn’t as uncommon. The girl and I demonstrated polar opposite behaviors. She was manic, threw tantrums for being abruptly pulled out of school, and clashed with the white patients when they accused the Black patient of being too “aggressive and insulting”. They eventually sent her to the third floor, where the patients with the most severe symptoms stay. One thing I noticed is that those of marginalized races, like the Hispanic and Black folks, were often thrown around in other units just because the staff couldn’t communicate with them correctly. In addition to my new friend being sent to the third floor, the “aggressive” Black patient recently transferred to the second-floor unit after apparently fighting with another patient on the third floor. The staff should’ve realize that there are alternative, appropriate methods to treating patients with mania, irritability, and psychosis rather than just placing them in another unit. That method of treatment just leaves the patients in the same disturbed state, but in a different place. Pretty soon, the other patients started noticing the special treatment I received from the staff. “Hey, you don’t work here! You’re one of us, right?!” a man yelled at me. I was one of them; I was in the hospital because I needed the same therapy and psychotropic medication. But, I was also one of the staffers, in the sense that I was Filipino and Asian-American. I felt guilty for the privilege I had as the youthful, token Filipino patient. My race and age afforded me the privilege of being humanized by the predominantly Filipino staff, a benefit that many people didn’t have in the hospital. I was thankful for the compassion I received from them, but at the same time, I felt regret for not telling them that they should be treating the other patients the same way they treated me. As I reflect on my experience in the psych ward, I would heavily suggest that all psychiatric hospitals create some sort of ethics department. This type of department could educate the staff on appropriate ways to interact with the patients in a culturally sensitive way. I think a lot about how my several social identities have intersected to form me into a more sympathetic patient. There’s not only race and age that plays into it; there’s also my sexuality, class, gender and type of mental disability that painted me as the boy worth saving. I was the bullied, gay, middle-class, Filipino-American, 18-year-old boy with Major Depressive Disorder with Psychotic features. That struck a chord with the staff, perhaps a chord a little out of tune with the other patients.",2017
How to Feel Emotions (because most of us were never taught),"Originally published at stronginsideout.com on February 27, 2017. I want to have a heart-to-heart today because I think that — while I’ve mentioned it a couple times in previous posts here — I don’t think if I’ve ever told you exactly what I believe when it comes to emotions. Here it is: People who struggle with depression, anxiety, eating disorders and addiction tend to feel things VERY deeply… which isn’t an issue in and of itself. The issues come when we judge our emotions or refuse to feel them. Tell me if any of this sounds familiar: I shouldn’t feel this way. Why can’t I just stop it? Come on, suck it up. Don’t be weak. People who are the way I want to be don’t feel like this. Get your sh** together! Shut up. You’re so stupid. You have no right to feel like this. When we invalidate or judge our own emotions, we strip them of their ability to teach us. Uncomfortable emotions like sadness, hurt, grief, or anger come to us as smoke signals from the body and brain. They are signs that something is out of alignment in or around you. They don’t just appear out of nowhere and they definitely don’t happen because of some “weakness” within you. Many of us were taught that emotions are things to be hidden. We heard words like “crybaby.” We learned that raw anger was “crazy.” We were judged and punished for our feelings. And so we learned to not deal… which led us to an inability to cope with emotions as they come… which led us into mental illness, addiction and even physical problems. Everyone feels emotions. What creates true emotional endurance is what we do and think when they come to us. There’s no right or wrong way to feel. It’s the most particular thing in the world. That said, there are habits that we super-feelers (depressives, anxious, disordered eaters or addicts) perform that make recovery nearly impossible: Either of these habits is bound to make your recovery incredibly difficult if not altogether impossible. To help you break them, I want to share with you my personal process to handling the discomfort of feeling. This question makes me aware of any triggers that might have set me off, which helps me deal with them more directly should they ever happen again. It also helps me be objective about the situation if I immediately start to judge myself for the emotion. Pinpointing the thoughts I’m having about what happened can lead me into a better understanding of any old beliefs or thoughts that no longer serve me. This question is the first step to healing them. This is one of the most difficult, yet critical questions to answer. Many of us have developed connections between our self-worth and things that have nothing to do with our self-worth. For instance, many of us feel like we’re only worthy if we look a certain way or have a certain job. Neither of those things has anything to do with how worthy you are as a human being. In this same regard, we tell ourselves a story about what it means to feel certain emotions. Common ones are: If I catch myself telling these stories, I can externalize them and recognize that they’re just stories, not the truth. I remind myself that the strongest people on this Earth feel these things, too. It took a long time for me to get here, but now I truly believe that there is a place for every emotion and that it is totally ok to feel them. If you’re not there yet, I understand. It takes some getting used to. If you want freedom from the power of the super-feels, acceptance is a crucial step. In the past, I’d hold onto emotion after traumatizing events by questioning why they’d happened to me and refusing to accept that they had happened. By doing this, I trapped myself in emotion that was demanding to be felt because I refused to face it. All because I thought it wasn’t fair, that I shouldn’t have to deal with it. What I’ve found from my years of recovery, however, was that consciously working on acceptance of the event — doesn’t matter how big or how small — helped me to release the hold the event had over me. Things happen in our lives that aren’t fair. It sucks and it hurts and it can seem like there’s no law or order to it. We can either fight against what we can’t control, or we can accept, learn about ourselves through the experience and grow. The acceptance makes way for the reframe. Reframing is a term used in therapy that more or less means that we take focus away from the judgment or shaming that we’re doing to ourselves, and place it on a thought or belief that serves us instead. For instance, if I found that I’m telling myself I shouldn’t feel a certain way because I feel like I should be past that by now with all my recovery, I’ll reframe it to one of these: By shifting my focus to a thought or belief that serves me (instead of drains me of diminishes my existence), I give myself permission to have the emotional experience. Let it out, Loves. I know it’s scary. I know it’s the most uncomfortable feeling in the world. This step is where a lot of us get caught or give up entirely. Most of us have been taught to just “suck it up” and move on, but that just packs it down. Emotions demand to be felt. If you don’t consciously allow the feeling, they will find a way to make themselves known. Suppressed emotions become or worsen the very maladies we’re here to overcome: depression, anxiety, eating disorders and addiction. They directly lead to their creation or strengthening. If you truly want to take back the power in your life from any of these issues, train yourself to be ok with not being ok. Let the emotion move through you so it doesn’t stay in you and become something worse. [tweet it] It helps me to also use this mantra: “It’s ok for me to feel this.” Say it over and over again until the emotion has moved through. After I’ve done all the hard work of checking in and feeling the feels, I have the opportunity to grow from this experience. I believe that everything happens for a reason, even the most awful things. This is my religion. When I look for the lesson, I allow myself to move forward from it. Sometimes, the lesson won’t be clear until years down the road, but simply acknowledging that the lesson is coming is enough for me to let. it. goooooo. Want a real life example of this? Check out this post. You can feel emotions however you choose to feel emotions. It’s your life. If you want freedom from them, if you want your power back from those diagnoses, then you may consider trying this process, too. It won’t happen overnight, but you’re worth the work this takes. Feel on, Love. That’s what we humans do. Stay strong, Amy Amy Clover is a speaker, writer and mental health advocate.
