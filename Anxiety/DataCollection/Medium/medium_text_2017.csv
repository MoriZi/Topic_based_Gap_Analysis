"A simple, short technique to beat Anxiety","A simple, short technique to beat Anxiety Often there are worries that occupy our minds for days. More often than not, we are in fact aware that the anxiety is irrational and we engage in a mental conversation with the anxiety trying to replace it with rational thoughts. I’ve personally found this strategy to be ultimately useless. It doesn’t help in relieving in the anxiety much and doesn’t prevent anxiety from coming back. Instead, here is a simple, specific technique to beat anxiety that I’ve personally used and found useful :- Note that the while the last point isn’t in your immediate control (technically what you can directly control is what you write down in your test and not how many marks you score), I felt it was useful to juxtapose that against “how many marks others score” as that is something that’s almost completely beyond your control(Unless you’re willing to resort to Chatur Ramalingam’s strategies from ‘3 Idiots’) Do share your queries in the comments. I’d be happy to provide further explanations and examples. Also if you try it out, share your feedback with me via comments or PM. If a few people are curious, I might write a post later on why this works and why our usual strategies (e.g. imaginary arguments with anxiety) fail.",2017
other life,"other life In my other life I am not scared. I have no fear; I do not shy away from opportunities, I do not neglect to take chances, I do not lay awake at night wondering if I will die in my sleep if I close my eyes. I do not, in my other life, get into my car thinking surely this is the time I will get into a terrible accident. I do not answer each phone call with panic at my throat, thinking it’s bad news. I am not scared in this life. In my other life, I do not worry. I do not imagine that every time a loved one leaves the house it will be the last time I see them. I do not view every venture outside as a chance for something tragic to befall me. I do not, in this life, imagine planes falling from the sky, carjackings, heart attacks. I do not engage my mind in worst case scenarios. In my other life my hands don’t shake, my heart doesn’t skip beats, my stomach doesn’t do battle against butterflies. In this life, I am not always imagining the end of things: life, love, happiness. In this life I enjoy the little moments, I am present, I fully envelop myself in each minute, without thinking about how fleeting it all is. I do not, in this other life, doubt and second guess myself. I do not think of myself an imposter, someone masquerading as a good enough person, a good enough worker, daughter, sister, mother, wife. In my other life I enjoy my successes without eyeing them suspiciously. In my other life, I do not fear failure. I embrace opportunities, I take chances, I try without churning about in my mind the possibility that I won’t succeed. In this life I do not live in a constant state of anxiety; I am calm, I am rational. In my other life I realize it’s ok to be flawed, I accept who I am, I love myself unconditionally and let others love me without questioning their motives. In this life I appreciate myself and what I have to offer the world. In that life I create without fear of rejection, I love without worry, I embrace without pushing away. I live to the fullest, I put myself out there, I recognize what I have to offer the world without downplaying it. In this life, I am inside looking out. In my other life, I am there, beckoning.

Self-care for anxiety and panic,"Self-care for anxiety and panic The other day a friend told me she had a rough panic attack earlier that morning. In the moment I tried to listen and be supportive without offering advice. This letter is the advice part, in case she might find it helpful, and I hope it will help others as well. At times I’ve doggy-paddled haplessly amidst waves of anxiety and have had some unsettling panic attacks. I’ve since learned to cope pretty well and believe that if you’re not feeling a little anxious occasionally, you’re probably not challenging yourself enough. Here are the tips people have shared with me over the years. Accept yourself. Anxiety doesn’t define you. It actually helps us in a lot of ways, alerts us to trouble. Can be an amazing teacher. Might make you more perceptive. What makes you uncomfortable in some situations can give you an advantage at other times. Unchecked, it can tragically limit your life. If you can turn down the volume and listen to what it’s trying to say, it can point the way forward. Know you’re not alone. Lots of people feel anxious at times. It doesn’t define you. You can learn to surf the waves. Have empathy for yourself, and for others. Take care of the basics. Get plenty of exercise, sleep, water, real food. Quit caffeine? This was a big one for me — was a bit of an identity crisis, but well worth the effort. Life on the other side is much less j-i-t-t-e-r-y. Don’t use alcohol as a permanent social crutch — it’ll be harder at first, but practicing sober will strengthen precisely what you need to strengthen. Groom a bit and get a haircut. Wear clothes you like. Doesn’t have to cost a million bucks or consume all your attention. Some people have a tailor customize their thrift-store finds. Play. Do something playful every day. Develop a playful life. Expose yourself. Exposure therapy’s the most helpful thing. Think of it like going to the gym. To build skills, start challenging yourself a little each day. Start wherever you are, maybe just a smile or a nod to a nonthreatening stranger. When that’s easy, try saying Hi to a few people. When that’s no longer challenging, try a little small talk. Put a star on a calendar on the days when you actively challenged yourself. Walk around where other people walk. Toastmasters. Improv classes. Volunteer or work in customer service. Be a beginner. Slow and steady. Breathe. Mind follows body, body follows mind. Breathe in three counts, hold one count, breathe out four or five counts, repeat until you feel calmer. Breathe in deep and sigh audibly out through your mouth like the storm is over and you’ve reached a safe harbor. Meditate for five minutes a day. Observe your breath and thoughts without judging or evaluating them. Embody confidence, lightheartedness, tranquillity. Mind follows body, body follows mind. A few times a day, raise your arms high and push out your chest like you’re a runner triumphantly crossing the finish line. When stressed, it can be grounding to squat down like you’re playing marbles or talking to a squirrel. Try fluid dance moves. Make yourself laugh. Flex and relax your muscles one by one. Relax your face, your jaw. Reframe the conversation. Mind follows body, body follows mind. The physical sensations of anxiety and excitement are very similar to each other. When vexed, smile and say out loud, “I’m excited.” Try it with or without an exclamation point. Can get you unstuck and help you take action. Find delight. Whenever possible, play “what do I like about this?” We’re naturally skeptical, and vigilantly scan our environment and our mind for trouble and negatives. Balance this by consciously identifying things you like wherever you go. Could be as simple as a color, a shape, or a texture you like. Notice you’re no longer inwardly focused. Find a model. My yin yoga teacher Anne is the very personification of self-care, at least when she’s teaching. When I get troubled I think “Anne’s got my back.” It’s not about the specific person, but the qualities they represent. Your person could be Beyonce or Thich Naht Hahn. Find a village. Develop a rich in-person social network. America’s Disney culture focuses so much on romantic love. We can find ourselves believing a single person can do it all for us — oh my god, what the fook, laugh out loud, smack my head! Totally unreal, totally isolating, yet totally ingrained. It’s an incredibly fragile, stressful way to live. Do not put all your hearts in one basket. Expand your social universe to include best friends, once-in-a-while friends, at-work allies, business associates, hobby buddies, neighbors, teachers, support professionals, strangers, pets, other people’s pets. All can be an incredible help for a human such as yourself, moving through life. Same goes for your biological family — keep the channels open, but don’t expect miracles from your fam. They’re human like you. The more you’re able to meet your needs externally, the better you’ll be able to relate to your blood relatives. Try all the social activities. Be a beginner. Ask for help, with the goal of eventually teaching others. Help others without overextending. American social life is now something you have to create yourself or actively search for. But it’s imperative that we do.",2017
Impromptu,"Impromptu Hey! Internet. How’s it going? It’s been a while since I’ve dabbled with the written expression. I haven’t expressed anything lately. I suppose it’s a good time to get started, this being my least favorite day of the year. Let me start with this, a picture of the most viewed item in my ArtPal gallery for the year 2016. As you know, Internet, if you’ve been paying attention this is called “The Journey Starts Here”. There’s a whole post about this particular drawing, from the previous moments in time, where I felt the need to express myself in a written fashion. You are a digitized being of sorts, scour your data banks or review the previous post I’ve made to familiarize yourself again with this drawing. Inadvertently, I’ve been observing the view count of each of the different pictures I post there and it has become interesting to see what others find interesting to view. Last year’s winner was “Pick One Mandala”. These two pieces are from the same series. I wonder what will be the winner for 2017. I doubt that it will come from the same series. I’m sure it has something to do with the title, which is appropriate for the upcoming year. The Journey Starts here for 2017, I’ll pick one of these circle and begin my journey. It’s been a rough 4 years, personally. I can’t speak for you, Internet, or the world or even the person who may happen to read this post. I guess I’m ready now to get started. Let me go paint a painting for my Mom. Until next year, Cya! Internet. P.A.L. (peace and love!!)",2017
