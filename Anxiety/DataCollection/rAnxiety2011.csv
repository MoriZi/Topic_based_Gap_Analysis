5,Is anyone else afraid of their voicemail?,"Okay, I have a lot of trouble using my phone. It takes some mustering before I can make a phone call, and I usually let an incoming call go to voicemail. The problem is, once a person has left a message, I still have a hard time checking it. Like as long as I don't check it, there's no message for me. Because who knows what could be on there! It drives me insane. Why can't I check my voicemail?",20,2011-10-17 00:43:35 EDT-0400

17,Anyone else get incredibly intense nostalgia on occasion? ,"I am a very anxious person, to the point where it has and probably should still be medicated. In addition to all of my regular anxieties, sometimes I just look back and think how great things were just a few years ago, and I don't think they will ever be that good again, I just don't see it in the world. 

I think this is tied to my anxiety because it is kind of an anxious feeling, but anxiety is a lot about not being present in the current moment, which nostalgia is clearly not. 

I guess I am just curious if it happens to anyone else. ",16,2011-10-06 05:58:27 EDT-0400

19,Finally made it to therapy,"I'm a 21 year old college student and I've suffered anxiety for years. Meeting new people and engaging in conversation has been really difficult and I'm filled with thoughts that cripple my productivity and ability to live my life. Most of the decisions I have made in my life are based on safety rather than whether it will make me happy

My anxiety finally culminated with a girl I had been seeing. I finally found someone I could trust with my true feelings and I let it all out, all of the fear and over-analyzing, all of the things I kept from my other friends and family to keep up appearances. She looked at me wide-eyed and told me that I have an anxiety disorder and should seek therapy. I had avoided thinking about it for years, but it finally got through. Calling the therapist was one of the hardest things I've ever done. One meeting down and I feel a little better. Medication was suggested, but I am reluctant.

Even if no one reads this, it still feels good to let it out. Thanks reddit, you get me through the day.",15,2011-10-04 03:58:12 EDT-0400
