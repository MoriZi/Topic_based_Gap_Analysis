I said all of this aloud when I was having a panic attack over a stupid intrusive thought that I was obsessing over. And for context I've done a ton of therapy and keep to a pretty strict routine to keep myself level... but sometime I slip. I wanted to share what helped me: \n\n\nMy anxiety, my panic attacks and my phobias are just my body's overreaction to stress. Panic over an intrusive thought does not mean that that thing is more valid, it is just my brain fixating on a fear, my fear of not having control over my wants and needs, my fear of irreversible change. Panic does not mean I want that thing to happen, and it does not mean I will act on these thoughts. All that this is, is my brains capability to blow a random thought into a fear, into an obsession... my brain does not simply let a thought go, it calculates it and sometimes sees it as a threat to my very being. And that's ok. It's just a thought. And thoughts can stay as just that... thoughts are not automatically actions and they are not automatically urges or wants... your brain comes up with nonsense all the time, every day... but if I do not look after my stress levels or care for myself when I've had a trauma, I will panic and my brain will latch on to the nearest fear... and run away with it. My fears are not desires, my fears are not predictions. They are just thoughts. And sometimes thoughts cause anxiety... panic does not validate these thoughts.. it merely makes it easier to obsess, makes it easier to fear your mind. It will pass. You will be fine. It will pass.

I asked him to resolve this problem before he went to bed because I had really bad anxiety over it.\n\nHe said, \"Why do I have to be responsible for fixing problems you create according to your anxiety schedule\" \n\nI'm so fucking done dating someone who doesn't give a shit about my anxiety. It's something I can't help, and it doesn't hurt to stay up an extra 10 minutes to work things out with me. \n\nI'm respecting myself and understanding my worth, and I've been a lot happier since.\n\nThanks for listening. \n\n",

The other members went mental and started unloading horrible things on me. People even private msged me bad things. I closed my app, and went in with the day. When I opened it again, my inbox was full of outrageously hateful things. So I went in and deleted my comment. \n\nBut after I deleted, I continued to get msgs. \nTurns out the OP was so excited about the drama, the votes and karma my comment caused, that he\u2019d taken a pic of the original msg and of my profile, and posted it on the subreddit.\n\nI asked him to take it down, at least my personal info. In response, he accused me of being crazy and manic, thus getting what I deserve. \nThe pic is gone now. And I banned him from my account. \n\nThis all triggered me. Though I\u2019m not bi-polar, I do have bad anxiety issues, and I was incredibly triggered by all the negativity of the whole incident.  Now I want to delete my whole account. \n\nThis incident is not a big deal, I know it. I get it was the \u201chive\u201d mentality in action. But I\u2019m triggered for first time in ages. Am I too sensitive for Reddit? \n\nDoes anyone have any skills or advice to calm myself down. I\u2019m crying over this. Should I delete account? Please help me put this into perspective. \n\n**edit: Thank you everyone for the responses**\nIn the moment, I felt like it was unmanageable, but I realized it wasn\u2019t important in the big scheme of my life. And considering how much I goodness I have found on subreddits like this one, there\u2019s absolutely no reason to delete my account. I just blocked the people involved, unsubscribed to the subReddit and now I\u2019m forgetting about it! \n",

I felt on top of the world ... which is always a bad thing isn't it as the drop is bigger.\n\nAfter lunch at work I was relying a message to a coworker who made a snarky remark about whether the message was going anywhere . It hindsight I know he was just being himself, something generally overlook but in that moment I felt my confidence and happiness crumble like a house of cards and no matter what I did I just felt glum.\n\nAnyone else had this happen and how do you cope with it to get back on track?",

            "selftext": "I was watching a movie with my fianc\u00e9 tonight when I started feeling tightness in my chest, pain in my left arm, pounding in my head, hot all over, and dizzy. I took some deep breaths, went to lie down for a while, stood out on the balcony to get some cool air, drank some water, and took some more deep breaths. The symptoms didn\u2019t stop, but they did ease a little. We finished the movie, then watched a little tv afterward, with the symptoms insistently nudging into my awareness on and off throughout the night - sometimes better, sometimes worse. I\u2019m still getting some twinges in my back and chest, but now, a few hours later, I\u2019m mostly back to normal. \n\nA year ago, I\u2019d be in the ER right now. I\u2019d have started crying, saying I felt like I was dying, and my fianc\u00e9 would have asked me (in a very supportive tone, but with not even a hint of truly believing I was actually in any danger, because he\u2019s a rational guy and this would not have been the first, or second, or even fifth time this had happened) if I wanted to go to the hospital. I would have sobbed \u201cno, I know it\u2019s probably nothing,\u201d followed eventually by \u201cI don\u2019t knooooooow though, I really feel terrible...\u201d and I would\u2019ve gone back and forth in that manner for anywhere from 5 to 30 minutes. I would have eventually said \u201cbetter safe than sorry,\u201d and my poor fianc\u00e9 would have gamely driven me to the hospital, waited with me, sat with me while I got an EKG, waited patiently for me while I got a chest x-ray, then listened patiently with me while a kindly doctor let me know my heart was fine and that I was having a panic attack. I would of course know this by this point, as the attack would have run its course and I would feel fine (though embarrassed) at some point during one of the waits in the little curtained-off room. \n\nSo I\u2019d get a Xanax or 3 and be sent home, having lost a few hours and several hundred dollars. \n\nBut not tonight! I forced my rational side to win this time. I didn\u2019t google any symptoms (what would be the point, really? I\u2019ve memorized all the top search results by now), but I did review what I knew. The chest pain wasn\u2019t constant. It moved around a little. It was sharp, not dull, achey, or pressure-y. I\u2019m getting over a cold, so the fact that the extra pounding in my head seemed focused around my sinuses probably had more to do with that than with an impending stroke. And if the worst did happen, I wasn\u2019t home alone. If I lost consciousness, my fianc\u00e9 would get me help. If my heart stopped, the hospital is 5 minutes away, an ambulance would be here in no time. \n\nNow, of course, I\u2019m struggling with thoughts like, \u201cBut what if I ignore it like this when it actually IS a heart attack, or a stroke? My efforts to be rational and not to overreact are eventually going to kill me!\u201d But even those thoughts don\u2019t bother me like they used to. They might again someday, because this condition for me is episodic and comes in waves. I\u2019ll be fine for a year, or two, or five, and then be a wreck for no reason for a month, or a year, or longer. But right now, I\u2019m good, and that feels awesome. \n",

            "selftext": "This has been a recurring pattern in my life. I find somebody who makes me feel good about myself and then when they start to pull away or just place me further down in their list of priorities, I feel incredibly anxious and depressed. I worry I'm not good enough for them or they've found someone better. This has happened with partners and friends throughout my life. I've always been attached to one particular person at a time.\n\nMost recently, it has been this guy. We weren't exactly in a relationship but we did have a friends with benefits thing going on for  a while. It was clear he wasn't ready for a real relationship so we decided to just remain friends. I guess I became reliant on his company and he was someone I felt I could be myself around. \n\nOnly recently he's been so busy with his life, I've barely heard from him and it's unsettling. He went weeks without contacting me and I was getting really anxious and depressed. But earlier today, I finally heard from him and I instantly felt so much happier. I could tell my mood lifted because I was dancing and singing round the house and it felt so good. I really wish I could feel like that without depending on others, but it was just like an instant reflex to his communication.\n\nAs I was speaking to him, I realised he wasn't that special and I shouldn't feel too reliant on his company, but at the same time I felt happier than I'd been for weeks. I felt like finally I can be myself again. Why can't I feel like that around everyone? Why is it only certain people I allow to see my happiness? Why is it when certain people distance themselves from me I turn into an anxious wreck and I can't focus on anything?\n\nIt's really annoying me, and I'm scheduled to get some CBT therapy soon so I can try and help myself, but I've had CBT in the past and it didn't really work. I'm just fed up of being this way. I want to feel peace within myself, without it being a reflex to an external source.",
