            "selftext": "I have had 1 of my best weeks in a long time this week, and now I am seeing life in a different shade of light it has got me wondering, why is there still such a taboo about talking about mental health? I myself am guilty of not talking about my true feelings for a fear of being judged and for fear of embarrassment but it is a serious illness just because it\u2019s invisible doesn\u2019t make it any less real, I\u2019m a 25 yo male with a young family who has been suffering from server anxiety and depression since I was about 19, although I have tried my best to not let it affect my life it has in certain ways, I\u2019m just rambling on abit now my point in posting was mainly for anyone reading to no that you are most defiantly not alone, you are amazing having to battle with yourself every singe day before you can even think about facing the day is one of the hardest things a human can go through, and better days are most certainly ahead of you, whenever I have a bad bout of depression I always remember that this feeling will not last forever just try to remember that, another thing that really pisses me of is the serious lack of support and help available especially in the uk, there is a crisis team available but that is when you are a risk to yourself, what about actually helping people before it comes to this? My experience of mental health support in the uk is terrible, my doctor couldn\u2019t be less interested if she tried she has had me on the same tablets for over 3 years which do not work but if I stop taking the side effects are woeful, I have tried cbt and it felt hyper constructed and regimented, like you have anxiety and depression you should fit in these kind of boxes sort of thing, it wasn\u2019t very personal and was focused more on exposure therapy which I myself didn\u2019t find helpful. And other than that that is it surly there are more avenues to try, if it wasn\u2019t for family and doing my own research into the science of anxiety and depression I very  well may not be here today, anyway have a good weekend all who read this.",

It'll be hard at first, very hard, and he might have a stupid limp for the rest of his life, but he will walk.

They're both really beautiful, have lower difficulty settings so they can be breezed through, and have some really nice stories there. I don't want to say too much in case of spoilers, but they both certainly really helped me and were very pivotal in my life.\n\nI want to know what games help you with your anxiety, so that I and others can check them out!

I was constantly worried about her and felt so incredible helpless. She had two operation in the late fall and after Christmas we decided with our vet that we were going to just provide her pain therapy and don't put her through test after test and vet visit after vet visit, which would have stressed her massively and lessened her quality of life.\n\nTuesday started her health to decline even further, she refused to eat even her favourite treats and since yesterday evening she also denied water. We made it her as comfortable as possible, wetted her mouth, kept her warm and discussed an at home vet visit today, but then she died around noon. She didn't suffer long and was surrounded by most of us.\n\nAnd while I'm going to miss her beyond words and trying to grieve and her death is also not helping my depression, most of the anxiety I felt for the last months and especially the last days has calmed down. Even though I worry now about our one year old dog and the rest of the family, I don't need to worry any longer about her, I am not helpless anymore and there is no more uncertainty. In the finality lies comfort. Now I can mourn her, keep her memory dear, let her go and eventually move forward. It hurts and the pain will never go away completely, but some day the joy of the memories will be greater than the sorrow.",

Yet I barely do any of these things. It makes me feel very unsure of my identity, because I kind of feel like these things distinguish me, yet I don't do them very often. Every time I feel inspired, my negative self talk pushes me away from acting on it. Any time I'm faced with a blank sheet of paper I get anxious and worry about messing up or creating something ugly. I also ask myself what the point is, like, if it's not seen and liked by many people, what's the point? And logically, I know the point is to get lost in the act of creating, which I usually do if I can get past the initial anxiety, yet this thought always keeps me from starting. \n\nAnyone else?",

            "selftext": "I work as an All-Purpose Clerk in a grocery store, and this is actually the 2nd time I've had an incident like this. I worked at smaller store before, where I still had stress issues and panic attacks. But I've recently had to move to a much bigger and busier store with much more unruly customers. \n\nI also have G.A.D and A.D.D, which I've been trying to manage without medication because the last several that I've tried never worked. Or made things worse. So I just do my best to handle it.\n\nIt doesn't always go well. Case in point, an incredibly irate customer on Superbowl Weekend who was so furious that we didn't have cold 30packs of bud light that he got right up in my face, shouting me down and threatening me over it. With no managers available to help me or back me up, either.\n\nI was already at a 200% panic level that day, and this just pushed it over the edge. I just had a complete stress-shutdown where I went limp and hit the floor. I had customers circling around, asking questions, touching me, trying to get me up, the angry customer just completely writing me off to yell at somebody else, and all I could do was just sob uncontrollably to myself on the floor in front of the *entire* front end. It was incredibly embarrassing (as I'm a grown man) and it left me pretty fucked up for a few days. \n\n*and It's been nearly a week and I can't seem to let it go.* My managers tell me it's something that happens all the time and I just need to forget about it, but it's really difficult for me. Now every time I walk in I'm just prepping myself for another encounter like that. \n\nAnd to be honest, I've wanted to leave this job for a long time, for years really. But I feel like I don't have a choice. Or that anywhere else I go will be just the same. I've had a few days off this week to cam down and relax, but now that I go back to work today I'm right back up there on the anxiety scale again. \n\nI'm not expecting any miracle advice, but I just don't know what to do with myself at this point. \n\n**Minor update:** I really appreciate the support from you guys, it helps me feel way less alone about it. Too many people I work with don't quite get that it's hard to just write off that kind of event and move on. \n\nI have actually been putting more effort into some better work. A majority of my job now is custodial, but I'm whatever they need at any given time. I've been looking into similar maintenance jobs at quieter places. For now, I'll just try to survive where I am until I get a bite from another employer. I've wanted out of this environment for a long time now, and I can't take too many more of these kinds of moments. ",

However, when I got home I instantly starting thinking she hates me, and when she texted me later I had a panic attack and started to spiral into the \"I'm an awful person I annoy everyone\" mindset because her texts were shorter than usual and it made me think she really did hate me. (Wow. just writing this out makes me realize how bad my anxiety can get)\n\nIt's strange because if someone else posted this and I read it, I wouldn't think the friend in this story hated me whatsoever, but when it happens to me it feels so real.
