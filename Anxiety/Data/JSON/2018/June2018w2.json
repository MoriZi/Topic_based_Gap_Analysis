            "selftext": "I used to have a ton of stomach problems due to my anxiety, though it has kind of calmed down over the past year or so. However.. the past week has been very stressful. Long story short, I have severe emetophobia (fear of vomiting) and last weekend someone in my family came down with the stomach flu. I've been super anxious and stressed all week because I'm worried that someone else in my family will get sick, or that I'll get sick. Every night for the past 4-5 days, I've been getting stomach aches (which of course makes me even more anxious because I'm worried that I'm getting sick \ud83d\ude44). Usually I just lay down (it's the only thing that makes the pain go away) and get comfy in bed, and then try to distract myself with reddit or something. Same thing happened last night, except the pain seemed different this time. Not just a little stomach ache, but actual stomach cramps. I used to get anxiety poops, as I like to call them, a lot and so I kind of figured that that's what was happening. I waited a while and eventually the pain began to subside, so I went to bed. Annnd I couldn't sleep. I kept waking up throughout the night with these weird cramps, freaking out thinking that I have the stomach flu or something. Anyway, I'm still having the pain this morning and I honestly can't tell if it's anxiety or if I'm constipated or something lol. Does anyone else experience this? How can I relieve the pain?",

I guess I've always been anxious about not getting likes and what people will think (I know it's ridiculous). But,  I finally just said \"screw the anxiety\" today and changed it to a nice one! It's a small step but I feel like I did something good for myself today. \n\nHave a great day everyone!",

            "selftext": "I've been seeing a therapist because my anxiety has reached a point where I'm now agoraphobic and can barely ever leave the house without freaking out. She's been encouraging me to go out more, even if it's just for a few minutes, because staying isolated in my room all week isn't doing me too many favors.\n\nI decided I'd go out and take some pictures this week (I was really into photography until a couple years ago when I got depressed) but I kept putting it off. I decided last night that I'd wake up today and drive up to the beach and take some pictures, no more excuses.\n\nToday I woke up and had every excuse in the world to convince myself not to go - people will be watching me, think I look suspicious or awkward, or too fat, or see me sweating (I sweat profusely from anxiety in public, it's one of my worst defects) and think I'm creepy, people this, people that. I also didn't get a lot of sleep, so I wasn't in the best mood - usually a good reason to stay home and not do anything. But I knew I HAD to go outside more, or else I'm just going to become even more afraid. But maaaaan I really didn't wanna do anything today. I was debating back and forth whether or not to stay home, because I knew I didn't want to go outside, but I also knew I'd feel like shit if I didn't.\n\nAfter about 10 minutes of back and forth arguing with myself, I thought \"just do it\". I'm not much of a Nike guy, so I'm not sure why it popped into my head, but in that moment it was actually decent advice. Just fucking do it. Get it over with. I might feel bad if I go outside and have a bad experience, but I'll definitely feel bad if I stay home because my anxiety says I need to. Just do it.\n\nWithin about 5 minutes I was out the door with my camera and tripod, and drove an hour to the beach. I planned on staying a few hours so I could get some nice sunset pictures, but unfortunately the weather sucked so that didn't work out - I didn't get any good pictures, actually. It was very bad lighting and I'm a little rusty. But it felt good to be using my camera again after such a long break, and none of the bad things I thought would happen actually happened while I was there. Nobody was looking at me weird, nobody even really noticed or cared that I was there (in a good way). Occasionally I'd walk by people and we'd just say \"hello\" as we passed. After spending so much time alone, just having that level of interaction with someone felt kind of nice, and it reminded me that not everyone is out to get me.\n\nI left early because of the bad weather, but that's alright. I went out, did my thing and came back - that's more than I've done in weeks, so I guess any progress is a good thing. Baby steps.\n\nI just thought I'd post this and maybe it'll help remind someone that you CAN get out and do the shit you want to do, even if your anxiety is trying to stop you. I really didn't want to go out today, but I feel a lot better right now than I would have if I decided to stay home. So yeah, **just fucking do it**.",

I'm still running numbers to get more data, but this is **YUGE**. We reached over a thousand people with this challenge, and reading through the comments, your response was overwhelmingly positive. \n\nI want to call out that u/zelis42 ran the challenge ENTIRELY on her own with minimal involvement from us. It's a massive undertaking, and she's been kicking ass at it. Massive, massive props to you, dude &lt;3\n\nLastly, I want to thank you, our community, for taking part. You're all amazing people, and we love you. Thank you for being part of our subreddit and for supporting each other.\n\nThe data's available at https://drive.google.com/open?id=1DZhwcJVE2NeryQNP6_JYSVoWvV7cWz7N.

            "selftext": "Over the last 6\\-7 months i've almost completely cured my anxiety and would like to share my experience in hopes of helping others who are suffering from anxiety and depression. \n\n1. Exercise. You don't need a gym membership or fancy equipment. Climbing stairs is one of the best workouts out there. Back when I was 15, before I started working a shitty retail job I hated (which played a big part of my anxiety), I used to go running twice a day, chasing after that runners high. There are few better feelings in the world than getting the heart rate up and getting a runner/cardio high. Even just going for a short walking break helps. Humans are meant to sit behind a desk at a computer all day long.\n2. Food and Fasting. Changing my diet has probably been the biggest help in fighting anxiety. I used to eat cereal ever day for breakfast, and eat a lot of carbs (pasta, pizza, rice, bread, potato chips, french fries) for lunch/dinner/snacks, as well as a lot of sugar. We aren't cows, drinking the milk of another animal isn't natural. Milk with cereal as well as the carbs I was eating throughout the day drained me of my energy and made me feel really bloated. Except for 1 or 2 cheat days a week, I started time restricted eating and have felt a lot better and more energetic. I only eat and drink between 11am and 7pm (exception being drinking water) and fast the other 16 hours. My diet now consist's of lots of fruits and vegetables (often in smoothies), lots of eggs and a lot of meat.\n3. Less screen time. I completely avoid looking at any screens (phone, laptop, you name it) for the first hour I'm awake and for the last hour before I go to bed. My brain feels a lot more present and at ease. I do some basic stretching instead.\n4. Feeling a sense of accomplishment and getting things done. If you know something needs to be done and it'll take you less than two minutes, don't wait, just do it. There a few better feelings in the world than when you accomplish something, even if it's something trivial and meaningless. Make your bed. Shave. Do whatever chores you know need to be done and do them right away.\n5. Use a planner. Every night before bed I take out my calendar and write out when I'm going to do the next day, which helps to keep me focused and honest with myself throughout the day. Make sure to write down me time as well.\n6. Try something new/do something that sucks everyday. You never know what will happen. Traveling made me realize that I want to be an actor/filmmaker, so I started going to acting auditions for student films and writing my own scripts. While the idea of acting may seem horrifying to someone with social anxiety, it's one of the best things you can do. Acting forces you to be present, to remember the lines and be in your characters head, not your own. My first audition was terrible, but I felt a huge rush afterwards. I survived the experience. With each audition, I became more comfortable in front of people and the camera. I was terrified, but moving past my fear got me cast in two short films.\n7. When you are faced with something difficult, stop and ask yourself if you're giving up because it's hard, or if you just aren't interested. I'm a university drop out who's tried learning computer programming 3 times in the hope of getting a decent job. I quit each because I hate it and I know that it won't make me happy. I've recently started taking parkour lessons for fun. Will it land me a career? Probably not, but it's fun and incredibly difficult with straightforward goals to strive for. Go into a new experience knowing that you suck, which means that you can only get better it you stick with it (assuming that you enjoy the new experience).\n8. As I mentioned earlier, fight past your fear. Dealing with anxiety or depression is a marathon, not a sprint. Take small steps. Do you walk down the street looking at your phone and you move a few feet to the side when someone approaches in your direction and get upset over how awkward you were? That was me for a long time. Start by continuing to walk straight instead of walking a few feet to the side. Once you're comfortable walking like that, leave the phone in your pocket. After that say hello. It'll probably come out as you mumbling. THAT'S OK, you're improving. Being able to start up a twenty minute conversation with everyone isn't the goal.\n9. Every night before bed, I always think of something positive that happened during the day. Something that happened to me, something I did for someone, something someone did for me, something I did to progress my life forward, something I learned. It my seem small, but outlook has a huge impact on your life. I always get annoyed when I hear someone say to just be happy. Even if you had a bad day, at least one good thing happened. Go to sleep focusing on the good thing that happened. Perception breeds reality. \n\nPodcast have been a huge help for me in learning to try different things, being more health conscious and positive.  I highly recommend listening to the Joe Rogan Experience episodes with Dr Rhonda Patrick and David Goggins as well as the Jocko podcast with Dr Jordan Perterson. I hope this post can help someone get better. ",
