            "selftext": "I felt my panic attack coming on while on my way to a talk at a recent conference I attended. It always starts with vertigo for me, and quickly leads into feelings of fear, claustrophobia, and the inability to catch my breath. Usually, the second I feel that dizziness hit I know there\u2019s no stopping the panic attack that follows it. I hole up in the nearest bathroom stall and resign myself to riding it out, a process that can take hours and often results in DAYS of constant vertigo afterwards.\n\nI felt it coming on as I was headed to the talk, but it was a talk I was really interested in so I was like \u201coh no you don\u2019t!\u201d I focused my mind on some mindfulness techniques i learned in therapy\u2014namely, the technique of observing my surroundings closely and mentally taking note of them (there is a red backpack in the corner, the man next to me is wearing black shoes, one of his shoelaces is untied, the room smells a little bit like sweat, etc) and GUESS WHAT. For the first time EVER, without medication, I got the panic attack under control. And I was able to enjoy the talk and get a lot out of it!\n\nI\u2019m so proud of myself, you guys. I had to share because I want you all to know that even if you\u2019ve been struggling for years, there ARE mental techniques that can help keep panic attacks from hitting. We can do this! We don\u2019t have to be anxiety\u2019s bitch! And that\u2019s the best feeling in the entire world.",

            "selftext": "Long story short, I started working when I was still in school, completely my choice, I was 17. Worked for about 2.5 years. Off the books, cash in hand. I quit to move to the city hoping to get a better job. I didnt. I was stuck there for 4 years. Trapped in a toxic house with an abusive couple. I was agoraphobic. I couldnt save myself because it got the stage where I thought I deserved to be treated like that. Everything got worse, the anciety, depression, insomnia. Thought about killing myself daily. Fast forward 4 years, landlord decides to sell the house. Ohshitimgoingtobehomeless. My parents rescued me. Didnt even ask lol\nA year at home meant I ate 3 proper meals a day, that I cook for myself. Before I was living on porridge because I was below the poverty line. I started walking the dog 3.5km every other day atleast. I was sleeping better, eating better, wasnt touchstarved anymore. I started seeing a counsellor. Hes the only one who properly listens to me. Even if I talk pure nonsense for an hour, it helps. He says I shouldv seen someone years ago. Well duh lol\nI have a lot of repressed trauma, years of blanks. I struggle a lot with how empathetic I am. Far too sensitive. Never seen it as a hoft like others do.\n\n\nAnyways, good news though. Iv started working in a day centre. I get myself up for work every morning, I have breakfast, I throw up from nerves, I make myself presentable, I walk to work. Its only my 6th day tomorrow but Im getting into the swing of things I think. I finished all the morning tasks 30 minutes into my shift this morning and one of the other women acknowledged it. Its....strange being praised. Im not used to it at all. One of the men even said I have a pleasant disposition. Its weird ya know. I mean Iv never been confident or had good self-esteem. I have been given out to aswell, doing something the wrong way or at the wrong time. Iv even been told off for things I know somebody else, more experienced did. I work part-time and we dont have set breaks because you kind of have to work around things. It took 3 days before my boss realised I hadnt taken any lol She told me she'd make me take them aha. Kinda weird aswell. I kinda feel stupid taking breaks. Idk. I suppose Iv to get used to it.\n\nAnyways, this is just, an update, since Iv posted before. Two steps forward, one step back. Slowly making progress. Im veing properly adulty again, took me long enough hah!\n\nI wish you all the best on your own journey x",

I feel like I destroy relationships around me. A few moments ago I frantically went through my contacts to see if there was someone who I could call, and I didn\u2019t know who. So I sat there at work and just found a moment to turn around after smiling all day, and just burst out into tears mumbling \u201cI want to go home\u201d. I don\u2019t even know what that meant. Even if I went to my house, it\u2019s not like it would go away. My boyfriend is in Japan for a while, which is dangerous because if I get a bad episode, it\u2019s really easy to mass text (via \u201cline\u201d) my problem. And I don\u2019t even know what my \u201cproblem\u201d is. It\u2019s even worse being raised a Christian, and being one by choice, because most of the Christian advice is to just \u201clet go and let God\u201d. Then I beat myself up and feel like a failure, because I can\u2019t \u201clet go and let God\u201d.\n\nMy closest childhood friend in the world who\u2019s like a brother to me is soon to die from cancer. You know what\u2019s fucked up? Anxiety feels worse than my sadness for my dying brother. 10x worse.\n\nI would constantly make it a part of me.\n\nMy anxiety is tearing my relationships apart.\nMy anxiety is causing me to lose my mind.\nMy anxiety sometimes makes me want to kill myself.\n\nIt\u2019s all my fault.\n\nMy therapist taught me to say *the* anxiety. It\u2019s not my anxiety. Anxiety does not define who I am. Anxiety is not the first thing everyone notices about me, even if I\u2019m convinced it is. I am actually a very strong, sassy, stubborn person. *The* anxiety is a clinical condition that simply comes in and tries to take over who I already am. *The* anxiety is more manageable than I think, because one of my more defining qualities is strength. It doesn\u2019t belong to me. Some days it feels stronger than other days, but it\u2019s not mine and I refuse to let it linger.\n\nYou have anxiety. But it\u2019s not yours.",

I am frustrated with myself because during the week I study less (try to get in 1.5-2 hours most days) because I am exhausted at the end of the day so the weekends should be my time to dedicate to this. I kinda wanted to self care this weekend since I know these next few weeks will be emotionally taxing, but at the same time I feel like since I know I will be expending my mental energy on work that means I SHOULD be studying as much as possible this weekend. I cant win, I'm so nervous I cant truly relax and self care, if I dont study I feel lazy and I know my time is ticking before my exam comes up, but if I do study I dont feel like I'm able to work/absorb information at my full capacity.
