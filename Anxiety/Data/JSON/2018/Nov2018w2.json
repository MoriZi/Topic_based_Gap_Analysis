            "selftext": "WARNING: I put trigger warning for those who deal with any type of existential dread or fear. If you\u2019re like me, simply reading about it can set you off. But if you\u2019re willing to, then please read.\n\nWell I\u2019m 18 years old. I\u2019m a senior in high school and I\u2019ve been kinda stressed out from one of my classes which I have a TERRIBLE grade in. I\u2019ve been into Buddhism and spiritual stuff for a while. I\u2019ve been meditating too, and experimented with shrooms one time (I\u2019ll bring this up later). But lately I\u2019ve been thinking so much about death and the ego and the human experience that I\u2019ve been living with this dreadful perspective that\u2019ll occasionally surface.\n\nIt might have something to do with video games. The reason I say this is because sometimes I question why I\u2019m in this body. I question why existence exists. Why do I see? Why do I feel? Why am I in this body? What am I MEANT to do? What are the secrets? I know it\u2019s a meaningless cycle of thought, but I simply cannot help myself.\n\nIt\u2019s rarely ever SCARY. Most of the time it\u2019s just uncomfortable. It just starts to feel awkward being in this body. Last night, I was researching stuff about it and found depersonalization, which didn\u2019t sound exactly like what I have but it seems very similar. It was at night before bed. I was scrolling through photos and saw a drawing of a man in a room looking out of an eye, like he was inside of the head. This sat with me weirdly. \n\nSo I put my phone away and tried going to sleep. And I couldn\u2019t stop thinking about that picture. It made me think that seeing was really weird and could even be scary. Then I got really scared. It was the type of fear that you feel like nowhere\u2019s safe, because that fear exists purely in your perspective. Then I started shaking really bad. I wanted to stop thinking about it. Eventually I calmed down. Then I started thinking about how weird it is that I have a mind, like everyone else. But I am ME. I think I felt isolated because of this. The human experience was really getting to me. I started shaking again, then I tried going to sleep, and was successful.\n\nThis fear was not unlike a pretty scary magic mushroom trip I had about a month ago. It awakened an existential fear. Every moment was torture because it was a moment. I was scared of the present. I was scared of existing, but scared of not existing. I don\u2019t like talking about it much so I won\u2019t go too in depth.\n\nOf course, it\u2019s not always like this. But general anxiety dictates that I go around every day scared of this fear. And of course, that means I think it\u2019s always a threat. Makes me think it\u2019s always SOMEWHERE. And that\u2019s how it can come back.\n\nI dunno. It could just be existential angst. Could be depersonalization. But it can be painful. I think I might start going to therapy for it. Can anyone offer any advice or help? I\u2019m not asking for a diagnosis. Just wondering if I\u2019m not alone, and what I should do. Thank you.",

I'm 23 now, and I first went to therapy when I was 16, doing a long-term behavioral therapy focused on my social anxiety and mild depression (both diagnoses from back then). This helped me a lot and I've been able to deal with it much better since then, of course with some ups and downs. I used to have fairly frequent panic attacks and such, and didn't have them for many years.\n\nI'm currently in a short-term therapy, focusing on me trying to get my life plans together a bit. My life has been very confusing but also liberating, and while it's hard I like where it's going. But I've also had more and more issues again with feeling depressed, and anxious, and having panic and anxiety attacks. I talk to my therapist, and I enjoy my therapy with her, but I always find myself either downplaying how bad I truly feel at times and justifying it with issues I have, or not bringing it up at all because, at the time, I feel fine. She has offered many interesting and helpful coping methods and I have been doing much better. But.\n\n**Some days I feel like I'm waiting for a call that might bring awful news. I feel this anxious restlessness, this inability to really focus on anything because you just want to wait and know what's up. But there's no call. I'm not waiting for anything. I'm just anxious and stressed and restless and it keeps me from doing productive or fun things. It's been keeping me up at night so I've been going to bed later and later to just tire myself out.**\n\nMaybe also important: I currently work freelance, entirely self-managed and from home. I briefly had a regular retail job which I did enjoy, but I hated how restricted it made me feel and it required mass amounts of customer interaction, which was too mentally tiring over time, so I quit on my own terms and don't want to go back. I want to study in the future. I'm home a lot, but I either do my work, handcraft, or learn my partner's language, when I manage to do so. \n\nI feel like I've just been trying everything, I try so hard to work past it, my living space is super clean and colorful and happy, I take care of myself, I hang out with friends when I feel like it, I've gotten rid of destructive coping mechanisms, and it's like it's getting worse, and I'm so sick of it. I just want this permanent underlying anxiety to get the hell out of my life.",

I am trying to get back into playing guitar, but even attempting it sends me into a downward spiral. All I can think about is I don't know where to start, that I will never be good at it. I played for about 3 years before stopping and quit it because all I could think about was how I wasn't any good at it. \n\nI dropped out of college after 4 years for similar reasons. Sitting in class made me feel overwhelmed. It got to the point I could no longer focus on studying or homework because all I could think about was how much of a screw up I was. This of course led to me failing classes, which only reinforced those thoughts and just turned into some vicious cycle. I can never get out of my own head to enjoy anything. I attempted to go back to college and dropped my classes within the first two weeks because I had a near panic attack sitting in class.\n\nI don't really know what to do. I am trying to move on with my life. I try to make new friends and put myself out there, but some days it feels impossible. How do I get out of my own head? How do I start enjoying things? How do I even pick up new hobbies or finish college without it giving me an anxiety attack? Some days it just feels so overwhelming.",

Now that I know I suffer from anxiety I feel like I\u2019m unable to do a lot of the things I once did. I used to be a big coffee drinker but can no longer drink it anymore because I get super anxious. I also get super anxious just driving in my car and feel a rush of adrenaline just sitting next to someone at a stop light. Another thing I\u2019m barely able to do is play any type of first person shooter game because I get to competitive and end up getting really anxious and my heart starts racing in certain situations of the game. I\u2019m curious if anyone else noticed anything there not able to do anymore after a few panic attacks? ",

            "selftext": "Some days are better than others, that\u2019s for sure. My last really bad day was last Wednesday. I feel panicked and anxious often. Sometimes I don\u2019t recognize right away that I am entering a panicked state of mind and start to get worried that I\u2019m dying. This is common. Irrational, yes, but it happens often. I have learned to calm myself down, although it takes a lot of time. \n\nAnyways, last week I didn\u2019t recognize my panic. It looked different and felt different. Different thoughts entered my head and I\u2019ve never been so afraid of myself. I have a pretty long commute and driving in the dark has been a trigger of mine recently. I was driving at night (an hour and a half) and tried listening to music and podcasts to get myself distracted. But I couldn\u2019t help but imagine myself dying. Horrible images and thoughts kept popping into my head. Like I said, I experience this often but it felt different. I felt scared and worried and numb all at the same time. I got home and had a conversation with my dad. I know we talked but even 20 minutes later I had no memory of our conversation. Idk what I was doing or saying. I was on a weird autopilot. I then took a shower and felt eerily calm. Slowly my breathing got faster and I laid on the shower floor in fetal position. I felt like crying but couldn\u2019t. I panicked  and started thinking I was going insane. My panic was increasing FAST and all I kept thinking was \u201cI\u2019m losing my mind\u201d. I started freaking out and couldn\u2019t get up. Eventually I got out of the shower and googled \u201cI feel like I\u2019m going insane\u201d. Anxiety and suicide hotline numbers popped up. It wasn\u2019t until then that I realized I was having a panic attack or something. I\u2019ve had them before but I couldn\u2019t recognize it this time.  \n\nI then sat on the floor and did my breathing exercises. When I was done I realized I needed to plug the nightlight into the wall and the toilet paper needed to be put on the roll. It took me 10 minutes to decide which to do first. I couldn\u2019t make a decision. I felt crippled by the choice. I would reach for one and freeze and start crying because I literally couldn\u2019t figure out which to do first. This has never happened to me. I have never experienced that and I\u2019m so scared to experience it again.\nI\u2019ve never been diagnosed with anxiety but I know I panic at times. I don\u2019t really have any questions here. I just feel weird and scared about this experience. I\u2019d love to hear if any of you can relate or have any thoughts. \n\nThank you for reading. Xx",

            "selftext": "**Trigger warning-** \n\n**mention of self harm**\n\nSo ive been dealing with social anxiety for most of my life and I only came to realise what it was only a couple months ago. I told my close group of friends at that time that I was struggling. They knew I was going to therapy and that I struggle to make friends. Never the less, when we all moved out and went to college and uni (all still very close to each other geographically) they stopped talking to me and hanging out with me. Even when we did once, my closest freind in the group mentioned that I must be lonely, after not talking to me for weeks, which means she knew I wasn't going to be doing well but wasn't there for me. They made better friends with eachother and when I did ask one of them to hang out she would just say maybe and then never get back to me. This made my anxiety worse and for over two weeks I isolated myself in my dorm and sat alone with urges of self harm. Its been almost 2 months now and I feel better, I have a couple of friends and i'm ok with spending most of my time alone. I came to realsie my anxiety escalated when I was in this group, and when I was with my friend that I was closest to. Now I have just received a snapchat from someone in the group. Im scared incase they want me to hang out, how do i say no? i feel bad if i do. If i do meet up with them I know i wont feel good. Im feeling myself starting to panic.",

            "selftext": "So I just came out of a psychotic episode, actually had to be institutionalized because of it.  I was extremely paranoid and just all the typical detachment from reality stuff happened. Anyways, I got anxious tonight because I was thinking about what if this happened again, how to I make sure it doesn\u2019t happen. I had a small anxiety attack and instead of self harms or doing something dumb and impulsive, I wrote down all the things that trigger my anxiety. Maybe 10 of them max are they same things that I wrote down again but I have listed 114 triggers and beliefs that cause me anxiety and I have serval rituals listed too. These rituals can cause me an immense amount of stress and paranoia when I don\u2019t complete them. Hell, one of my biggest regrets was from almost a decade ago and...it\u2019s about a leaf. I didn\u2019t step on this leaf that I looked at and though, damn I should pay attention to that leaf and step on it because it needs my attention. I didn\u2019t step on it because I already was doing that and my friends were annoyed by it. So  now that\u2019s created weird rituals from having to touch things and walk in certain ways to avoid me thinking I didn\u2019t care about an object and that I would\n\nA) come back to haunt me in someway\nB) determines if I go to Heaven or Hell based on performing or not performing these rituals I came up with in my head. \n\nSometimes I can rationalize it, but it affects my day to day life. I try soo hard not to do it when I\u2019m around people who don\u2019t \u201cget it\u201d.  I feel like I hurt a pen\u2019s feelings if I don\u2019t use it frequently while taking notes. I just have this belief that inanimate objects have feelings to an extent and can control my after life and judgement by God. ",

In all my classes I have to sit in the third seat in the third aisle furthest from the door. It's where I feel the most comfortable and secure. I absolutely do not like attention on me. I found where I sit allows me to be able to see just about the entire class. I can't explain it but for some reason it makes me feel secure to be able to see everyone.

            "selftext": "I'm going to start this with a passage from Sylvia Plath's *Bell Jar* because it perfectly encapsulates what I'm feeling. It's pretty well-known and I'm taking it out of context, I know, so try not to roll your eyes.\n\n**\"I saw my life branching out before me like the green fig tree in the story. From the tip of every branch, like a fat purple fig, a wonderful future beckoned and winked. One fig was a husband and a happy home and children, and another fig was a famous poet and another fig was a brilliant professor, and another fig was Ee Gee, the amazing editor, and another fig was Europe and Africa and South America, and another fig was Constantin and Socrates and Attila and a pack of other lovers with queer names and offbeat professions, and another fig was an Olympic lady crew champion, and beyond and above these figs were many more figs I couldn't quite make out. I saw myself sitting in the crotch of this fig tree, starving to death, just because I couldn't make up my mind which of the figs I would choose. I wanted each and every one of them, but choosing one meant losing all the rest, and, as I sat there, unable to decide, the figs began to wrinkle and go black, and, one by one, they plopped to the ground at my feet.\"**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI've been out of school for about a year after dealing with some extremely stressful financial difficulties that forced me to take a leave of absence. Lately my self-worth has been super low. I applied to transfer to some schools last spring and my father was extremely uncooperative in completing the CSS and I never got aid packages. Instead of sorting this out and picking a school to go to I just.... did nothing. It's what I do when I'm stressed out or scared. I do nothing. \n\nExacerbating this is my immature and myopic need to go to a prestigious school. My current university from which I am taking a leave is pretty good and well-respected (\\~28% acceptance, to give an idea, not that it matters), but several of my friends go to ivies or \"junior-ivies\", leaving me feeling comparatively... dumb. On the other hand, part of me wants to say \"fuck that\" and go to a hippie school in Canada or a small school like UNH and immerse myself in nature. I was considering going to school abroad because it would potentially be cheaper with my dual citizenship. As my finances stand, I'll likely have to go to a state school realistically unless I find out a way to take out loans in my own name. \n\nAnd that's the other thing. All of my expenses from here on out are my own. I am lucky enough to be able to live with my mother, but I will have to pay for college myself. Working for the past year has left me with 10k... enough for one semester at my current university.\n\nAnd I don't even know what to DO with my life! That thought alone is more immobilizing than anything else. How can I transfer and try to get my life back on track when one day I think I could be a biologist and the next be not journalism?\n\nWhen I tried to transfer last year, I enlisted the help of so many people, had professors write essays, talked to college counsellors.... some friends even offered me money. I wasted their time. Here I am, still at home, a loser literally living in my mom's basement.\n\nI was recently diagnosed with mild depression and have been working on it, but I'm afraid that I will never get my life back on track at this rate. Simple things like calling schools and talking to financial aid or talking to the CSS people to fix that issue feel... insurmountable. I hate it. I avoid phone calls like the plague. I'm complacent and I sit at home all day and try to distract myself with work and random hobbies. Every potential move seems wrong. ",

I feel like i can never catch my breath. but The worst part is the paranoia. I always always always think EVERYONE is against me. My family, co workers, friends, and even my SO.  I can be so quick to cut people out of my life. I hate myself a little more everytime it happens. \n\nSo three months ago i moved to California (20 something hours from my hometown and family) to follow my girlfriend to college. We\u2019ve been together almost two years now and i am sooooo extremely thankful for her. She has never hurt me in any kind of way. The complete opposite!!!!! She has done nothing but take care of me and support me. seriously though you guys would LOVE her. (everyone does) \nbut recently i have been so scared i\u2019m going to lose her. my paranoia and zero self esteem has gotten the best (or should i say the worst?) of me. \nI\u2019m terrified my gf is going to leave me for someone she meets at her new school. Someone smarter and prettier than me. Even though She has never ever given me a reason to believe she would leave me for someone new.... i just can\u2019t stop the thoughts and fears. i\u2019m cold. Anytime i get anxious i take it out on her. I try to tell her about my fears but then i just feel like i have to justify them. I feel like the biggest burden alive. \nshe deserves better than me. i just can\u2019t seem to convince her of that...  \n\n\nI\u2019ve been trying to get an appointment with a therapist and/or a psychiatrist but my insurance is pretty much Non-existent   so i\u2019m screwed. \nI don\u2019t know what to do.

I am now on week 3 of Buspirone and my chest hurts quite a bit while on it and that makes me super anxious on top of the anxiety it has failed to alleviate or help with. My psychiatrist does not want to prescribe benzos due to their habit forming side effects, sedating effects, or memory loss effects which she emphasizes greatly. \n\nI am in college and it is tremendously hard to be on campus.

            "selftext": "(Buckle up kiddos because this one's long)\n\nI went to a regular primary school (age 6-10), then was \"home-schooled\" from ages 10-14 (literally no social interaction during that time besides a long-distance abusive relationship, constant fights with my mother because she didn't know how to teach me, I learnt literally nothing during those years except how to be even more depressed and self-harm). Ages 14-18 I went to a regular highschool\u00a0 (best years of my life, made lifelong friends) and graduated with slightly above average marks.\n\nTook a gap year afterwords because I had no idea what I wanted to do with my life. Took 3 short courses during that year, just as something to do.\n\nHad a mental breakdown at the end of that year, because I still had no idea what to do, and all my friends seemed to have everything figured out. That was last year. Due to the mental break I had, I went to go stay at a clinic for 3 weeks at the beginning of this year which was....less than optimal. Nearly lawsuit inducing, in fact. It barely helped me.\n\nI pretty much did nothing this year except for help my parents with their business, and get diagnosed with a bunch of co-morbid anxiety and depression disorders, as well as agoraphobia and ADD. The ritalin does help. The (barely, because expensive) monthly therapy sessions kinda help. The antidepressants help slightly, but not enough.\n\n\nNow it's the end of the year, and I'm still shaky on what to study. I was going to go and start with a graphic design diploma at a prestigious school (literally the only thing that I remotely like and am good at), but I had a massive panic attack two days ago and realized that if I went with that school, there'd be no guarantee of a job, and I'd be paying off student loans until I'm 30.\n\nSo, no studying next year either. I'm planning on working, and I've already sent my CV to as many jobs I can find. It's incredibly scary, but I know I need to do it.\n\nWe're also seeing about the possibility that I was misdiagnosed, and that I actually have bipolar disorder\u00a0(which my mother has) because my meds don't seems to be working as well as they should.\n\nAll of this, while my friends have been studying in respectable fields\u00a0 (I.T and science), while working and earning work experience at the same time. They can drive, they can talk with people, they can leave the house without feeling terrified.\n\nI. Just. Can't.\n\nI feel like I'm a complete waste of space and a burden on my elderly (60 and 72) parents. My friends will be finishing their degrees this year, and what do I have? Nothing. Two years of feeling like I have to start studying something ASAP or I'll never be able to support myself, ever. Two years of being a total fuck up. Two years of being absolutely terrified of the future. Two years of being depressed as fuck and near constant worrying and anxiety. Two years of looking at my peers and wondering why I can't just be fucking normal and self sufficient.\n\nTwo years of absolutely hating myself.\n\nI know it's stupid, but I feel like I've already lost. I feel like my life is over, like I tripped up at the starting line. I feel like I'm trying to compete in a race with two broken legs.",

I don\u2019t know what this is, but I feel it is getting better. I\u2019m glad it doesn\u2019t happen when I\u2019m going to sleep, but I desire to eradicate this phobia. Anyone know what it is?
