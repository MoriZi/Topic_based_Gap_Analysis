Every time I get even into the smallest of debates, I'll *always* feel like the bad guy, even if I didn't cause it or even if I'm right. I hate making people upset so I'd rather admit I'm wrong (even if I'm not) or apologise just so it pacifies the other person. I always visualise fake or past arguments in my head where I say what I actually wanted to say and it makes me feel angry but it's also empowering because I'm saying what's on my mind without the consequences of saying it for real.

            "selftext": "I have battled anxiety for nearly ten years now. I\u2019ve been on and off antidepressants (been off almost two years). Over the years I have used CBT, therapy, and mindfulness meditation to reduce my anxiety with moderate success, but I still \u201cslip\u201d a lot and it can come back with a vengeance sometimes. \n\nI recently kind of \u201cstumbled\u201d into exercise. I used to hate it and dread it as nothing more than a means to burning calories and eventually losing weight. But after reading a ton on how it can help anxiety and depression (which I\u2019ve known for years) I casually just said \u201cOk what the heck?\u201d. Lots of people take medicine everyday for anxiety, why can\u2019t I try this as a form of medicine? \n\nSo for the last week, my husband and I have been waking up at five to work out before work (I\u2019ve learned that it NEVER happens after because I\u2019m a teacher and I get exhausted at work). The results? AMAZING. I have felt more at ease in the last week than I have in years. I only work out for thirty minutes and I do a variety of strength and cardio. The type of exercise does not seem to have any effect on the amount of relief. Even just a brisk walk can do it. I can not recommend it enough. Don\u2019t wait to try it like I did. Seriously. A doctor gave me this advice years ago and I wish I would have listened. Go get your CDC-recommended 150 minutes a week and see what it does for your anxiety. I think you will be amazed. ",

            "selftext": "A letter to you, and to me:\n\nI case nobody has told you yet; today, or ever in your life, it\u2019s okay to be average.\nThere used to be a time in which average was celebrated. You helped your tribe live, you helped your family with basic labor, you got an average job that paid for the basics in life.\n\nBut nowadays, we are so connected to everything in the world through modern technology that we only hear about the extraordinary. The stardom, the wealth, the self-made men and women, the prodigies, the brilliant people who have found the formula to promote themselves and find a following in such a noisy world. \nAnd amongst all this, it\u2019s so easy to not feel good enough. Indeed, everyday I feel myself fighting that constant itch of insufficiency.\nLook at all these people out there who are so much more capable than me.\n\nBut it\u2019s okay to be average. Truly, it\u2019s just fine. Most everyone is. Most people have average intelligence, average income, average popularity, just a few friends, an average relationship. But few people celebrate being average anymore, only the best and most extraordinary. And it\u2019s destroying our collective psyche. We are becoming less happy and less self-secure.\n\nSo here\u2019s to you, average, not outstanding person. Whether you still live at home or don\u2019t have a good job, or have never been on a date or are overweight and unsatisfied with your body. You are doing great! Being average is just fine. Don\u2019t give up on your goals, certainly, but don\u2019t criticize yourself for not standing out or not fulfilling your greatest potential; indeed, most of us haven\u2019t. Imagine how much more comfortable everyone would be if we were as sharing of our insecurities and shortcomings as we were our successes and accomplishments. Maybe everyone would feel okay to just be living and trying.\n\nAnd remember, NO MATTER WHAT, You are still worthwhile, important, brave for facing the world each day, in your own way. Keep it up.\n",

But lately there have been physiological symptoms, mostly tension in my body resulting in a lot of back and neck cracking, shortness of breath, irregular sleep patterns, and increased heart rate, especially after drinking. The other night I drank four beers, napped for an hour, and when I woke up I realized I couldn't go back to sleep because my heart was beating fast. My brother said he gets this too.\n\nAlso, intrusive, repetitive thoughts are becoming common for me. Then I think about how this must mean I have an anxiety disorder. Then I worry about having an anxiety disorder. It's a never ending cycle.\n\nAnother weird thing, I love music, but songs get stuck in my head and repeat ad nauseum constantly in the absence of external stimuli. Does anyone else get this? I always thought this happened for everyone, but I don't think it does. It's like my mind is never quiet. It's either always worrying, talking to itself, or playing a song ad nauseum. \n\nI think it's time for me to see a professional and maybe get some medication. ",

            "selftext": "I'm at my boyfriend's place and he lives near the airport. There's currently an airshow happening and there's a lot of jets flying by at various elevations, all deafeningly loud. \n\nThe noise makes me really uncomfortable to say the least. We were outside a little bit ago and one flew very low and was so loud I  almost started crying. As in, if I hadn't held back, I would've 100% burst into tears.\n\nI also hate being near fireworks, firecrackers are the bane of my existence and even super fast loud cars whoozing by on the street bother me... What the hell? I mean no one likes loud noises but starting to cry because of a jetplane seems a little ridiculous lol ",

About a month ago I adjusted my meds and I FINALLY feel in control enough that I am actually managing my anxiety using mindfulness techniques and cognitive behavioral therapy techniques! Just thought I would share. I\u2019m incredibly excited and don\u2019t have many people to share my news with. :)",

I always feel like other people know more than me about any subject. It could be something I am an \"expert\" on and if someone made a comment that wasnt accurate, I panic thinking they might be right and Im wrong because I am such a loser and they arent. I  think it also has to do with acceptance issues. I just want to belong and have people like me so bad that I will agree or entertain whatever they are talking about. Im worried if I disagree or respectfully add a correction they will end any contact with me. It seems silly but in my head its very real. \n\nI also think I am outside the loop on everything. Like everyone knows whats what and how to act and what to say but I have no clue. For instance, If I am part of a committee and we meet in my mind I am thinking that they all met earlier and they already know whats going on and Im just sort of there on the periphery but not part of the \"real\" core group. This actually did happen to me before, I didnt have friends from about 5th grade to Junior year. When I finally did get some friends, I was on the periphery and was not really well liked---this hurt me because I didnt know what friendship was (hadnt had friends since I was little) and thought it was really genuine.
