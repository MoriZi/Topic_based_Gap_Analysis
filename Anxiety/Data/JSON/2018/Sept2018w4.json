Eating out tends to be a really difficult process for me even when I\u2019m in company I\u2019m comfortable with, I\u2019ll often end up giving up and not finishing my meal because I think I\u2019m going to choke on every mouthful. I\u2019ve never eaten in a restaurant on my own in my life. \n\nToday though I thought \u201cfuck it\u201d I\u2019m not living my life around this fear anymore, so I popped into a small Thai restaurant near my home for lunch. I sat at my table and I ordered some food and I ate. It was overwhelmingly liberating, I could have cried.

            "selftext": " if you are feeling hopeless about defeating your anxiety right now, This article I wrote last week could help you. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTrying to defeat anxiety can feel very overwhelming at times. It can be hard to believe that we will actually be able to overcome it. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut you are the only one who can defeat your anxiety. You\u2019re gonna have to do it, no one else. And maybe it\u2019s not as hard as you think. Maybe there are some simple steps you can take in your life right now, that will put you on the right path.\n\n \n\nIn this article you\u2019ll discover 7 anxiety tips that you can apply right now. If you follow these tips you\u2019ll be more effective at your work, have better relationships, and be a more happy and peaceful person.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Anxiety tip #1 -  Stop consuming caffeine\n\nCaffeine increases the level of a neurotransmitter called norepinephrine in your brain. This neurotransmitter triggers your sympathetic nervous system. Stimulating your fight or flight response is the primary process of the sympathetic nervous system. \n\nCaffeine also makes your body release adrenaline and depletes your body of the \u2018anti-stress vitamin\u2019 B1 (thiamine). For anxious people these things add up quickly, making them feel stressed out and on edge. \n\nNote: The sensitivity to caffeine varies quite a bit between people. But whether you are sensitive to caffeine or not, **caffeine WILL make you feel more anxious**. It\u2019s best to avoid caffeine as much as you can. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Anxiety tip #2 - Set specific times in your day to be offline\n\nPeople with anxiety are usually sensitive and easily overstimulated. We might have gotten used to it, but the internet is a pretty hectic place. Your subconsciousness knows that at any time it could see something on the internet that will trigger it. You won't get really deep rest and stress relief if you are always online\n\n**It\u2019s very important that you create time for yourself every day where you KNOW that you won\u2019t be disturbed**. Most people don\u2019t recover well enough from their daily stress. That\u2019s why our stress accumulates and we end up feeling anxious and on edge more than we need too. We can make sure this stops happening by planning time into our day where we\u2019ll be offline. We should put our phone away and go read a book, meditate, or go for a walk everyday. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Anxiety tip #3 - Train yourself to breathe through your stomach\n\nScientists have recently discovered that humans have group of brain cells whose only function it is to \u2018watch\u2019 our breath. If the breath is slow, deep, and done with our stomach, it signals to the brain that everything is okay. If the breath is fast, shallow, and done with our chest, it signals to the brain that something might be off.\n\nBreathing in your chest is meant for fight or flight situations. It\u2019s original purpose is to get your body and your mind in a state of readiness by pumping a ton of oxygen into them. \n\n**Breathing through your stomach has been proven to lower stress and anxiety**. And it\u2019s actually not that hard to retrain yourself to breath like this all the time! If you learn to breathe through your stomach, you will be decreasing your anxiety automatically, just by breathing. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Anxiety tip #4 - Tie up loose ends\n\nYou could do this right now, and it would make a world of difference. We can feel very overwhelmed and anxious because we have so many loose ends in our life. We have mail that we haven\u2019t opened yet, we have friends we should call, maybe our room needs a good cleaning, or you haven\u2019t checked your bank statements in 2 months. \n\nThese things are tricky to actually go and do. The longer we procrastinate, the more anxiety we build up around them. But biting the bullet and doing all these things will reduce your anxiety a lot. It might spike your anxiety while you\u2019re doing it. But when it\u2019s done you\u2019ll feel much better and lighter. **The less we have on our mind, the less anxious we\u2019ll feel.** \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Anxiety tip #5 - Exercise at least twice a week\n\nNow most of us know that exercise is healthy and works well to reduce anxiety. But a lot of us don\u2019t realise just how critical exercise is. In his \u2018*Anxiety and Phobia workbook*\u2019  E.J. Bourne says **his clients reported exercise to be the most effective thing for reducing their anxiety.** \n\nExercise is a natural outlet for the body's fight or flight mode. There are many proven benefits to regular exercise. Among them are reduced insomnia, increased self-esteem, and greater sense of control over anxiety. \n\nPro Tip: Exercise that targets your larger muscles, like running, swimming, and cycling, are found to be the most effective for countering anxiety\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Anxiety tip #6 - Be in flow\n\nAthletes call this state \u2018being in the zone\u2019, Psychologists refer to it as flow. It\u2019s a state where you forget the time and whatever is going on around you. If you are in flow you are totally absorbed in what you are doing. Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi, the psychologist who came up with the concept, describes the 8 characteristics of flow as follows:\n\n1. Complete **concentration** on the task\n2. **Clarity of goals** and reward in mind and immediate feedback\n3. Transformation of **time** (speeding up/slowing down of time)\n4. The experience is intrinsically **rewarding**\n5. **Effortlessness** and ease\n6. There is a balance between **challenge and skills**\n7. Actions and awareness are merged, **losing self-conscious rumination**\n8. There is a feeling of **control** over the task\n\nFlow makes you temporarily free from your anxiety in a healthy way. It makes you more calm throughout your day and gives you something to look forward too. Find something that puts you in a state of flow and make sure you do it at least once or twice a week. It will make a big difference in in your life satisfaction.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Anxiety tip #7 - create an anxiety busting morning ritual\n\nMost people grab their phone the second they wake up. This is about worst thing you can do to start your day. It\u2019s very important we start our day on our own terms. We should let no influence from the outside bother us for at least the first hour of your day. Create a morning ritual for yourself that calms you and will give you the necessary strength to deal with your anxiety. \n\nWe shouldn\u2019t sleep on creating a morning ritual! It makes a massive difference if you start your day right. \n\nThose are my 7 tips for reducing your anxiety right now, so you can be more peaceful and more successful in your relationships, job, and your life.\n\nI have no doubt in my mind that you are capable of defeating your anxiety. You are absolutely able to do it. \n\nDid you think this article was helpful? If you did, comment below on what you would love to learn about defeating anxiety. If it\u2019s something I have experience with, I\u2019ll write my next piece about it.",

            "selftext": "I am having a very hard time this week with my anxiety because I feel inundated by the news related to Kavanaugh/Ford allegations. \n\nIn May of 1986, I, too, was gang raped at a high school party by boys that I knew, while I was intoxicated.  I am not going to share the details of the attack,  I am willing to say that I was hospitalized afterwards with significant injuries and I was unable to attend  my high school graduation because I was in the hospital.  Although I am pretty sure that my parents knew my injuries weren\u2019t from \u201cfalling down in the woods\u201d and the medical practitioners that examined me were very much aware that I didn\u2019t just fall down.. no one addressed the true nature or extent of it.. even me.\n\nI never talked about it. I never wanted to. I never wanted \u201cjustice.\u201d  I wanted to make it go away because for a long, long time I felt like it was my fault. \n\nAfter 32 years.. it\u2019s right there.. all over again.\n\nI want to scream at every Facebook poster that has something obnoxious to say about Ford not coming forward.  I want to punch everyone who says \u201cwell, she was drunk\u201d or \u201cBoys will be boys.\u201d  I want to vomit every time someone says \u201cwhy did she wait so long?\u201d and worse.. \u201che didn\u2019t do anything..he just didn\u2019t help her.\u201d \n\nI feel like this happened to me last week, not over 30 years ago.

Today, I was tired of not being able to be independent because I can't make myself drive. I told my SO that I wanted to drive in a really quiet neighborhood near our home. He drove there and after I took the driver's place. I was so scared. I thought i was going to crash or make an accident. I did it anyway. My SO was patient and gave me tips. I parked. He then asked me if I was up to the task of drive back home. To do so I had to go on a main road and a boulevard with a bunch of cars, poeple and construction. I hesitated but said \"fuck it\" and did it. I did it guys. I was scared and nervous all the way home. But I DID IT. I'm proud of myself and I even I'm excited (and scared) to do it again. \n\nBest luck for everyone out there.",

Often times, it even means you CAN\u2019T understand that what you\u2019re worrying about is irrational or not as extreme as your reaction warrants.\n\nAnxiety isn\u2019t just chest pains, crying, and the inability to relax. It\u2019s taking everyday parts of life and intensifying the excitement or fear they result in times a thousand, to the point that they seem impossible to face.

I messaged my therapist that I couldn\u2019t make it to my appointment the following day because I was going to drive out and see my grandma because she is expected to pass away soon. My therapist responded \u201cSorry to hear that. You will be charged a $125 for late cancellation. You can send a check or pay at your next appointment in cash.\u201d\n\nThis really upset me because it is the only time I\u2019ve ever canceled late (less than 24 hours before the appointment). I can afford to pay it, but she knows how worried I\u2019ve been about my grandma and this just seems uncaring to me. \n\nOn Friday she messaged me \u201cI sent you a bill. Please let me know when you receive it.\u201d This upset me even more and I responded \u201cokay, please cancel all my future appointments.\u201d She messaged back, \u201cWhy?\u201d and then I blocked her number.
