No one else knows I suffer like this - even some mild friends who somewhat know of my limitations don't know how bad it truly is. But I made it to Trader Joe's yesterday and didn't freak out, die, or run into anyone!! I bought some good food, was rung up by a lovely employee, and made it home in one piece. And I bought some flowers so now my living room has some pretty proof of what I accomplished.

I'm always trying to make new friends or make people laugh. I take solo back packing trips and my friends really see me as someone fearless and free-spirited. It makes opening up about my mental health issues kinda difficult because they can't \"see\" me acting this way. I have a lot of anxiety and depression issues around my romantic relationships. I also have depersonalization issues, and want to be alone more often then not. I think the fact that I can be so outgoing and positive most of the time, my friends don't realize that I struggle quite a bit some days.\n\n\n",

If you spent last night alone, I did, just let that go. If you're reading this then you made it through another year and anxiety didn't kill you.\n\nAs cliche as it sounds it is never too late to start over. I'm older than most of you, I'm sure, and late in the last year I committed myself to changing my life. I'm not attacking it all at once but in pieces. I'm focusing on my mind-body connection through meditation, exercise, yoga and muscle tension. I'm trying new medications again. And I've committed myself to taking real steps to address my isolation.\n\nIf this old dog can learn new tricks, so can you. There are a lot of resources online these days. Lots of ways to learn about anxiety. Lots of ways to connect with people both virtually and in the \"real world\". Doctors increasingly recognize anxiety as a serious problem that needs serious treatment. Over time society has placed less and less stigma on anxiety related problems (though there is still a lot of room for progress).\n\nPlease consider this my Happy New Year to everyone here and i hope 2018 is much better for you, and me, than 2017.",

            "selftext": "Tl;dr: I just feel like life is changing so much in my 20s that everything I know is just kind of disappearing. It\u2019s freaking me out. Anybody else ever felt like this?\n\nFirst, sorry for the long post. I was hoping it would come out shorter, but my brain\u2019s kind of a blubbery mess right now.\n\nLately I [24M] just feel like a lot is wrong in my life. Especially tonight, I just feel super sad and lonely, but it\u2019s a long time coming I think. Anything that\u2019s constant in my life I feel like is disappearing, and it has me really scared kind of.\n\nCurrently I\u2019m off with my mom, 1000 miles away from home, while we finish the ripping apart of my grandparents\u2019 household of 50+ years. Long story short, my grandfather died in May 2016, and turns out my step grandmother didn\u2019t give a crap about him or anyone else; she just wanted his money. So since he died, between battling with her and the trustee of the estate (a formerly trusted family accountant), it\u2019s been a painful experience watching the house where I spent summers for the past 24 years be ripped apart. I loved my (real) grandmother, and I really really loved my grandfather and identified with him so much, and it\u2019s just been so hard. So that\u2019s gone.\n\nMy last remaining grandparent is my dad\u2019s mom who lives close to me. She\u2019ll be 80 this June, so she\u2019s getting older as well. Because she lived nearby and my parents have full time jobs, she (and my dad\u2019s dad when he was alive) kept me and my sister a lot when we were kids, and she\u2019s always been a big part of my life. Also, my dad\u2019s sister/my aunt has always been kind of crazy, but lately she\u2019s become really insane (super super religious, her emotions are out of control towards other family members, says some really off the wall stuff, rambles for 2-3 hours when I talk to her, etc.), so she\u2019s not the same aunt I used to be close with.\n\nI\u2019m having doubts about being with my girlfriend of 3 years. Some days I wake up and I love her like crazy, some moments she does some things (occasional emotional abuse, acting like a child to get her way, loves to play the blame game about small things, etc.) that make me wonder why I\u2019m still with her. Our sex life is also pretty horrific. So that\u2019s a constant emotional roller coaster that makes me feel ungrounded.\n\nI\u2019m currently in a PhD I dislike. I love my fellow students (about 8 of us), thank god, but the actual program is soul draining. I do not like it at all, but don\u2019t know what else to do.\n\nI have some anxiety issues that make me doubt (and kind of hate) myself. Like summer 2016 I had a couple minor panic attacks and have since developed mild-moderate agoraphobia and fear of having more panic. It seems to wax and wane. Sometimes I feel like I cope with it awesomely; sometimes I feel so crippled by it I wonder how I\u2019ll ever function enough to get through life and how anybody can love someone as broken as me. The panic in particular is something that is relatively new, so it\u2019s been hard adjusting to it.\n\n(Note: I do see a therapist and have been for depression and anxiety for some time, so I am getting professional help)\n\nI also have some mild-moderate social anxiety which I feel makes it hard for me to connect with people sometimes. My social skills are good (I used to work at an Apple store where I was hired specifically for my social skills) so I know I\u2019m capable. Just the thought of having to make smalltalk sometimes though makes me want to run the other way and isolate myself.\n\nAlso, I became dependent inadvertently on tranquilizers prescribed (in a reckless fashion) by a psychiatrist. Coming off of those was pretty horrific, which didn\u2019t help anything. That was 5 years ago.\n\nI just believe my 20s are kind of a complete disaster, and all of the constants in my life I feel like are disappearing before my eyes. I\u2019m ready to feel stable and grounded again, and it\u2019s just scary feeling like everything in my life that I know and love is just slipping away.\n\nAnyone else ever feel like this?\n\n",

The job I was in earlier in 2017 was causing a lot of stress (I was a social worker) to the point where I left and was hospitalized three days later. I was at the hospital for ten days. I was diagnosed with Major depressive disorder, GAD, and social anxiety disorder.\n\nMy last job went fairly well (I was a deli clerk at a grocery store); my managers were kind and I liked the work...until they moved me to another store in another city and put me in a different position where I worked alone with no backup. I didn\u2019t last a day. I tried going back to work this week after I was offered another deli job at another grocery store, but I didn\u2019t make it a full day (the girl that was suppose to train me didn\u2019t show up to work and I cracked after three hours of being on my own). \n\nI have a wonderful husband who loves me no matter what and assures me that it\u2019ll take time to feel normal again, but I feel I\u2019m disappointing him. I\u2019m going back to school to be a chef so I can (hopefully) work in the back of the house with a small crew to deal with. It\u2019ll be two years though before I complete that.\n\nDoes anyone else struggle with work? How did you overcome it? I want to be able to pull my weight around the house, but I feel trapped.",

There has been a doubling\nof hospital admissions for suicidal teenagers, with the highest rates\ncorrelating with the return to school.\n\nAccording to the experts in the article anxiety can be defined as the \noverestimation of danger and the underestimation of the ability to cope.\nAnxiety is about the avoidance of uncertainty and discomfort.\n\nTeenagers from rich families suffered from anxiety as much as teenagers from\npoor families.   The sources of anxiety for poor teenagers were neighborhoods\nwith violence &amp; poverty, and abusive families.  Overall, anxiety among teenagers\nseemed to be about fear of failure, fear of being judged, and a feeling of\nbeing overwhelmed.  Many felt like they could never get to the point where\nthey could say \"I've done enough, I can stop\".  The researchers interviewed\nsaid it was not completely about helicopter parents.  Teenagers are now\ninternalizing their parents' worries, driving themselves crazy with their\nown thoughts.\n\nThough initially reluctant to do so, researchers had to place a portion of\nthe blame on the rise of social media and technology like smart phones after\nresearch showed a high correlation.   Social media makes anxiety worse by\nteenagers constantly comparing themselves to their peers.  Smart phones\nprovide both a source of anxiety and a source of avoidance.  Avoidance makes\nanxiety worse.\n\nThe use of smart phones provide an illusion of control and certainty.  Teenagers\nnever learn to face risks and adapt to interactions that do not turn out\nas hoped.\n\nExposure therapy as a component of cognitive therapy has been shown to be\nthe most effective treatment, even more so when combined with appropriate\nantidepressants.\n\nAvoidance makes anxiety worse, which gives parents the dilema of not being\nsure when to push their children to face their problems and when to give \nthem space.\n\nParents and schools of been failing on the side of giving teenagers too\nmuch space.  Teenagers have been getting the dangerous message that they\ncan not handle being triggered and that they should not have to face things\nin their environment that make them uncomfortable.\n",

I had my doubts too, but if your brain is firing too much and causing anxiety, meds are made to calm your ass down. I love you all.",

            "selftext": "As someone with few friends as it is, I find myself really reluctant to trouble anyone when I am having a bad day anxiety/mood wise. I live with my mum and sister and to be honest, they are the only people I feel comfortable talking to when I'm struggling and even then I find it hard. Lately though, it has felt as though my mum has been getting fed up with me. When I'm having a bad day, such as today, where I feel very down, have low energy, and kind of generally anxious, she seems to cold shoulder me. It's like she just cannot and will not deal with it. Thing is, I don't want or need her to deal with it and, as pathetic as it sounds, sometimes it would just be nice to have a hug and just know that she is there. She has been acting quite irate toward me lately anyway, little things like nitpicking or being easily displeased. I find it hard to know whether it's really happening or if my anxious brain is just overthinking things, and whether it's because of me or something else. Either way, right now I am feeling very low and like I don't have anyone to talk to. I am unsure if she is fed up of having me home (I moved back from uni a few months ago due to mental health) and I feel stuck, because I cannot afford to move out but I'm not sure I can live with this negative atmosphere for at least several more months.\n\nI don't know why I'm posting this, really. I just wanted to vent. My anxiety is running high but my mood is running low and altogether I just feel utterly rubbish. ",

And OF COURSE, the ONLY one that ever made breakthroughs with me was the one that was $200 a session. My mom made me stop going to her because she couldn't afford it, understandable. \n\nBut I can't get a job due to anxiety/OCD. Self-treatment isn't working for me, I need a therapist. I've tried everyone in my area. The $200 one is an hour away.\n\nEvery time my mom makes a dumb \"get over it\" comment about my anxiety/OCD, I say \"I need a therapist\" and she fires back with \"Well get a job\". Would't it be nice to get a job! But to do that, my anxiety/OCD has to be treated.\n\nIdk the point of this, I just know maybe someone here can relate to this vicious circle of hell.",
