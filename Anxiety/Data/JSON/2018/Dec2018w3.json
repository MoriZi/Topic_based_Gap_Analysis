I\u2019m 21 now btw. \n\nBut looking back on it I was always such a worrier when I was a kid in primary school. The  tiniest issues would cause me great stress and I remember having stomach aches and never being able to sleep the night before school out of worry. ( oddly they were very tiny issues but I guess to kid they\u2019re massive). Makes me wonder if I was going to end up with anxiety traumatic event or not. Also it makes me sad that majority of my childhood was riddled with worrying . Sigh. \n\nI wonder how common it is to be a \"worrier kid\". \n",

But it happens, it\u2019s life, all sons and daughters eventually do it. I hate that she thinks my psychologist is drilling in \u201cidk what ideas that make me react like this\u201d, when all she is doing is helping me cope with my anxiety. That\u2019s literally just it. My sessions are purely about my anxiety.  \n\nAnyway. Rant over. I\u2019d appreciate if anyone has some tips on how to deal with this. Thanks Reddit \u270c\ufe0f. ",

            "selftext": "Anyone else struggle with this? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI've never considered myself overly OCD before, perhaps just quirky in a few regards (counting steps). But after a nasty break up a few weeks ago, it's taken on a whole new life. I suddenly feel the need to confess to EVERYTHING. I'm talking confessing to my parents for everything I've done, decades ago, to old teachers, to friends for ever omitting or lying. The cause (I think)? The (narcissistic) ex called me a liar after I confessed to him something quite trivial. \n\nPerhaps it's my mind's twisted way of proving to myself and the world that I'm not a bad person or a liar. \n\nIt feels like a complete compulsion, like I HAVE to do so the moment it pops up in my head. And if I do confess, it's only temporary relief before the next compulsion comes along. \n\nIt's interfered with my life to the point where I'm not enjoying things I used to, often unable to get out of bed but then panicking while in bed because all I do is think, not being able to eat. It's sheer insanity, and it came on quickly. \n\nI've tried numerous meds and am currently on a few, though I came off of an SSRI a couple of months ago. I plan to go back on one once I get back up to my doctor in January (I'm away from the doc on winter break). I'm just hoping to find tips, tricks, or stories of your own, for the meantime. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThank you for any and all help, even if it's just to commiserate! ",

But after school started I got super-charged, I started going to the gym, I met some new friends, I went to a couple parties, I got drunk, I was incredible. For some reason all the anxiety I had just didn't exist for a solid 4 months. I went to someone else's house for the first time in ~4 years, and I didn't feel a twinge of anxiety. Most times I didn't really feel any anxiety at all, even when a normal person would. I was genuinely super-man. But the last probably two weeks I've been watching myself just fall. I'm not at all motivated to go anywhere with friends, and when I don't put myself out there and don't get invited to things I shit on myself. I sit at home and just get more paranoid and anxious. Last couple day of class I couldn't focus at all in class because I was so anxious, and I left the gym after like 10 min because I was so overwhelmed. Driving home yesterday for the first time since summer I had some casual thoughts about self-harm and suicide. Nothing has changed but I'm falling apart and I'm really scared that I'm going back to where I was.",

            "selftext": "So I'm happily married, with two lovely (if rather boisterous at times) daughters - home life in the main is good, if rather chaotic !\n\nBut when I was in my teens, there was a girl in my class at school I was utterly besotted with. She would never have gone out with me because I was the dorky, awkward-but-nice kid at school with terrible hair. But for 3-4 years I was utterly, madly in love with her in the way teenagers are: I loved it when we were in the same class for certain subjects; we were both in the school orchestra so I could see her then; she lived near me and re-worked my paper round route to go past her house. (This was in the mid-90s.)\n\nNothing ever came of it and I did get over it... sort of. I moved away ten years ago from the city we both lived in, but we hadn't really seen each other properly in about 10 years anyway, at a school reunion, where any ill-effects from my teen obsession weren't a problem. She's also now happily married with two children.\n\nBut I say \"sort of\" because every now then she turns up in a dream of mine. Not often in a romantic way, often just as friends. But when that happens, it brings back up all the memories of those times when I was mad for her; I notice her Facebook posts more, I end up thinking about her a lot. Whenever I go back to the city where we grew up, part of me hopes to see her again. And this becomes anxiety-related, I think, because then I start feeling guilt that I'm being unfaithful to my wife, feeling like a creep for still having in my mind in this way someone from the best part of 25 years ago - none of which is at all helpful. I don't like it happening, but don't know how to make it stop.\n\nI've not told anyone this, not my wife nor anyone apart from this thread. But it's crazy and I just want some kind of closure, just for my mind to realise that that part of my life is over, we're both happily married, just to find someway to put a full stop on her. \n\nCan anyone offer any advice?

Today, when I woke up, I was extremely confused as I didn't remember ever getting home. My mom, who hadn't even seen me tipsy before, had to explain me that my friends basically dragged me home and I ended up puking all over my pillow (I don't remember any of it). My mom has been super nice about it, telling me it had happened to her before, laughing at me and telling me to be careful next time. But despite her having been so nice and acting as if nothing had happened, I can't stop feeling this terrible shame and guilt. I have spent the entire day with a constant knot in my chest and a desire to cry, and I need it to stop. I am very prone to having anxiety and depressive episodes and today isn't helping.\n\nI have learnt the lesson and I won't ever do it again as it was completely unnecessary. Can any of you give me any tips on how to stop these feelings?",

Except for a select co-workers whom I adore, I am unhappy with the job. Before just quitting, I made sure to make adjustments to try and better the situation. I mainly just hated sales and customer service so I moved to something more clerical, but quickly felt I was wasting my damn time. I found a different job in childcare, something I have always been used to and more comfortable with but the pay is slightly lower with the health insurance only being covered 50% (my current job covers 90%). My heart tells me to just leave, but I don't want to make a hasty move. I'm speaking to my manager soon and don't want to tell her everything because I know she'll quickly tell everyone else. There's just so many red flags about my current work place in addition to the work-anxiety that makes me believe I should just leave for my own sake, but I will make far less money with the other job. Would should I do? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThanks for any advice...",

            "selftext": "I\u2019m pretty sure I had a panic attack today again my second one within 3 months. It all started with me complaining to my mom about my anxiety and she keeps saying I\u2019m an hypochondriac and she didn\u2019t want to hear me complain anymore Got really mad and  threatened to call an ambulance on me and I went into panic mode telling her not to call I was too scared to go to the hospital in an ambulance to just stop I\u2019ll try and calm down on my own at home. It was so bad I started crying I couldn\u2019t take it anymore and couldn\u2019t stop for like 30 minutes or more and I kept pacing back and forth around my house. Now like an hour later I started getting this weird feeling like I was going to pass out and I felt like I didn\u2019t know where I was for a few minutes. I guess derealization feeling or an ocular (eye) migraine I don\u2019t know. Also I\u2019m tremoring really bad internally my neck, chest stomach, back, arms and legs basically everywhere. I also have head pressure (probably from working myself up from being in such a panic?) and just a few minutes ago my whole cheeks went numb along with my right hand for like 5 minutes I swore something was going to happen. I lied in bed tried to do some breathing techniques and it\u2019s helping a little bit my tremors are still going full blast and it\u2019s bothering me. What should I do? I don\u2019t want to go to the er anymore I\u2019ve already been 6x since three months ago unless I try a different er? Or is there a way I can stop my panic at home. I can\u2019t deal with this anymore I feel so bad but I have to get it to stop I have somewhere to be tonight and I can\u2019t miss it and make a fool of myself for not going. Do you think even if I went after the er could help me or should I just ride out this panic attack and wait till tomorrow and see what I feel like?",

            "selftext": "I'm going to try to get back into therapy once the weekend passes but I need help and support in the meantime.\n\nFriday evening, my partner of six years ran away to commit suicide. School, life, graduation, etc pushed him to a point where he couldn't cope and wanted to \"save me\" by killing himself. He seemed upset but okay, I went to use the restroom and when I was done here was gone. I called with no answering and just...knew. I called his family, they called him with no answers, and just after police were called, he came home to me. He wanted to go to the ER and he's now on a 3-7 day suicide watch. \n\nI'm lapsing into a very bad place I thought I was away from. I've been in what feels like a near constant state of panic attack, I'm unable to eat or drink, my pain tolerance for my autoimmune disease is gone, and I am having PTSD flashbacks about things that haven't crossed my mind in years. I just need help, but I can't reach out to anyone because it would mean revealing my partner's attempt. He left a note on my pillow and I can't go into the bedroom without collapsing. All of the tools my previous therapist gave me that helped me \"overcome\" my anxiety and depression aren't working. I'm so sick with worry. I can only visit at specified times and he's got a limited time to call. I'm so scared and guilty, I'm so mad, I'm falling hard and I just need someone to hear me while I wait to get professional help. My chest is so tight, and the muscles in my back have been tightened for so long that my back is in so much pain. Last night I had nightmares for the first time in years. I have to go to work Monday and I don't think I can. I'm just so fucked up right now and I can't talk to him or my other support because I don't want to hurt him. I'm trying not to cut but I crave having some control over something right now. I'm strangely upset that he's prioritized contact with his dad, whom he has a strained relationship with. I'm so scared to not have contact with him right now.  I'm not okay but I need to be and I just needed someone to hear me. Thank you for listening.",

I'm hungry as hell, but even thinking about food is making me wanting to throw up.\n\nSo my question is, what do you guys eat, if you can't eat?

            "selftext": "I had a panic attack yesterday over a bad argument and it was my second ever that brought me into a huge disaster. I felt like I was shaking profusely with internal tremors and I was going to pass out my face got numb along with one of my hands and I felt like a weird feeling again like I did the first time I guess it was derealization (still feeling a bit of it today or maybe just groggy I don\u2019t know just feels like soemthing is off in my head)? I also felt like I couldn\u2019t stop pacing around the house and I was crying so bad I couldn\u2019t stop it made my breathing super heavy causing tension in my chest. Last night I forgot to take my nightly Valium (probably a big mistake \ud83d\ude2c). Been on Valium for about two months taking it morning afternoon and night since cutting down to hopefully come off I\u2019ve been having problems like muscle tension in my shoulders,chest, neck and throat. (Went to the er wasn\u2019t heart related dr said probably from coming off the Valium too quickly) anyways today I woke up still feeling off from yesterday or either from forgetting my night dose of meds and I took my morning Valium dose 2.5mg didn\u2019t really do much yet since taking it two hours ago. So since my first panic attack about three months ago I completely cutout sugar, carbs and especially coffee cold turkey because I had a health anxiety scare. I tried some coffee again for the first time since today just black vanilla flavored Starbucks k cup with a splash of creamer and it seemed to help some now I don\u2019t feel 100% like I felt before yesterday\u2019s attack but I do feel a little better than I did before it when I first woke up. \n\nTd:lr So has anyone felt that coffee actually helps their anxiety if so how do you think it actually helps yours?
