            "selftext": "First of all, I am from Spain, so my english is not perfect.\n\nLast Friday I finally had a date with a girl I met on instagram. We were talking all the past week and we thought it would be a good idea to go out and have a drink. I was very nervous. \n\nI remember that before I went out, I had a shower, brushed my teeth, used mouthwash and I arrived 20 minutes before the proposed time. When she arrived, the anxiety attacked me and I did not know how to start the conversation, so I forced myself and said a couple of stupid sentences. I thought there was no way to go back. However, when she realized that I was shy, she started to bring up topics of conversation and took me to a bar.\n\n I remember that I decided to sit in front of her instead of beside her because of my shyness. I have never liked alcohol, but I thought that ordering a beer would be the best to disinhibit me. I asked her some questions I prepared before going out. But, like many of you, I was not able to have a long conversation. \n\nSometimes there was a serie of silences that bothered me a lot, but the girl always encouraged me and said that she thought that shy people are much more interesting than extroverted. That made me happy and suddenly she began to hold my hand. My confidence increased a lot in that moment. Realizing that not all women like extroverted men made made feel great, which caused me to feel much more comfortable and I started to talk a bit more. She was liking what I was saying and suddenly she kissed me on the mouth. At that moment I was happy again. All I needed was this. Feeling the affection of a woman. \n\nA few hours later we left the bar and she asked me if I would like to sleep with her. I became very nervous again because I was still a virgin (I am 20 years old). I decided to tell this to the girl and she said that nothing was wrong. She even thought that it was was cute! Then I challenged myself and my anxiety and accepted the plan. I was going to sleep for the first time in my life with a girl. When we arrived to the hostel, she took me to the bed and started to hug me. After it, she took off her clothes. I was nervous but I tried to get carried away by the situation. Then, we finally had sex. I lost my virginity. Afterwards, we went to bed together, embracing each other and, without a doubt, it was one of the most beautiful moments of my life.\n \nI tell you this to give you courage. If you leave the comfort zone, you can get almost anything. I'm serious. Before this, I was depressed and even obsessed with E.R. However, having fought against my anxiety has healed my mind.\nCheer up. Changing your situation is possible\n",

            "selftext": "I know this is long and I don't know if a lot of people will read this but I really just want to help. I had 2 panic attacks over the end of February and first day of March. I went to the doctor and had my blood work done, ekg, everything and they said I'm perfectly healthy. I workout 6 times a week. I had nothing to panic about! After that day, I started developing Harm OCD/intrusive thoughts about the recent news events that's been going on. It made me miserable, hopeless, and sometimes I would feel like \"what's the point?\" I wasn't depressed but I felt derealization. And then I went on to do CBT on my own, went to a therapist, and I realized I felt better but I would still get anxiety attacks. My anxiety kept jumping off to something else after solving one problem. So I kept searching for a cure which led me to learn more about diet, magnesium, and vitamins.\n\nMAGNESIUM - 70% of Americans are Magnesium deficient and I deprived myself even more when I was trying to lose weight. I started taking Magnesium (Magnesium Citrate is better, I just started those yesterday) and it made me stop stressing about unnecessary things and obsessing about negative thoughts! I slept better at night and my body stopped twitching A LOT. I stopped getting anxiety attacks throughout the day and would only get them maybe 30 mins each day now but I'd move on. I suggest taking 250 mg a day. Check the Magnesium deficiency symptoms cause this may solve your problems.\n\nDIET - Your body needs a minimum amount of Carbs, Fats, and Protein to function. All this plays a role in your mood. These macronutrients are also important in developing serotonin and transferring them to your brain. Serotonin can be developed naturally, as long as you  track your diet. I suggest Myfitness Pal app. Track the amount of grams of protein, carbs, and fat that you are taking daily. AT LEAST meet the minimum. Your brain needs this to function properly! \n\nVITAMINS - so many of us are deprived of important vitamins. Take multivitamins and Fish Oil. The Fish Oil with Omega 3 have helped reduce my irritation and I feel less mood swings! There have been less instances where I felt derealization and not motivated. I started taking all these supplements and tracking my diet Sunday and I haven't felt it since! I used to feel it every day. \n\nI still get anxiety attacks here and there but it's gone down to like 10%. It was at 60% a week ago. And I heard from people that it never came back even years after as long as they made sure they ate healthy, exercised, and made sure to take time off from stress. It also takes your body a long time to get your deficiencies back up to normal level and will most likely take around 3 months. So be patient. For people who has had anxiety or depression their whole life, it may be that your body just isn't as efficient when it comes to absorbing these nutrients. I know this isn't the cure for everybody but I hope this can help others. There's ton of videos and articles about this online. Friends who had anxiety were real life examples for me as they got out of it. I just don't want anyone to go through anxiety, it sucks and feels like hell. If I can help even 1 person feel better, it'd make me really happy. \n\nDoctors don't even ask us about our diet. Neither do most therapists. That's because they don't know about Nutrition. They don't study wellness. This was an explanation by a doctor from UCLA (forgot his name) as to why we never got blood work done in out nutrients. Doctors study medicine so that's what they prescribe. CBT helped a lot for me and I think it has to be a mix of all THERAPY, EXERCISE, HEALTHY DIET, and REMEMBERING TO TAKE TIME OFF STRESS that can help you manage anxiety. Man this is long af lol, shoutout if you read this whole thing.",

            "selftext": "Long time lurker, first time poster. This is a huge step for me, and I just really wanted to talk about it with people who also understand. \n\nLast Wednesday, my therapist set me a challenge - to tell one of my friends that I have social anxiety. I tend to think of my own mental illnesses as a shameful thing, something to hide from the rest of the world, whist I encourage other people who suffer from mental illnesses to share their experiences. She challenged me to tell someone I trust about my social anxiety, to relieve that burden (so to speak). \n\nShe also challenged me to try and make a new friend - to talk to people I haven't spoken with before. \n\nWell, I did both this week!! I talked to someone in my class that I'd not spoken to before, and turns out, he's really friendly and very nice to me - even when I feel like I'm being awkward, or not-so-comfortable in my social interacitons. So, I (about 5 minutes ago) just told him that I have social anxiety, after I admitted it's hard for me to have face-to-face interactions and he responded with something along the lines of \"I understand, and I'd like to make it easier for you\". \n\nI just don't have anyone else to say this to, but this is such a massive jump in my progress. I've cried for about 10 minutes now over my anxiety and how accepting my new friend has been - I'm just so happy over this! I never in my life, thought that I would be able to do something like this. But I did it!!\n\nThings are finally, finally looking up for me. I know I still have such an intense fear of social interaction, but just knowing that I have at least one person who's willing to speak to me regardless of my fears, just gives me hope that things will one day get better.",

He made me realise I have had it pretty tough but since I had no words for it I couldn't improve.\n\nI'm happy I can finally start taking control and begin living soon.\n\nI just wanted to say that I appreciate you people on this subreddit for helping me discover I'm not alone in this and that I can fight it and I hope you all can soon as well :)",

            "selftext": "Morning anxiety used to cripple and sabotage my life so. I'm sure many here relate. Here's a few small things that made a major, major difference in my morning demeanor and overall anxiety levels. ( Feeling good in the morning usually bleeds into the rest of the day )\n\n* Sleep, and get enough of it. ( Easier said than done, but a good nights rest is a natural Xanax. No lie )\n\n* Don't wake up thirty minutes before you have to leave. I used to do this all the time and it really fucks up your entire day. Honestly try to give yourself an hour and a half to two hours in the morning so harsh feelings of panic have time to fade out. Sit on the couch, watch YouTube, brew coffee, chill. Makes a major difference.\n\n* Eat. I know most of us can't even fathom consuming something in the morning, but it will give your brain life and nutrition it desperately needs to pull out of anxiety mode quickly. Greek yogurt is my go to in the morning since I have an upset stomach usually, makes me feel better mentally and physically. \n\n* Avoid worrying about the day. I know, way easier said than done. I realized one day that if you're always panicking about what could happen, you're constantly living in fear and enter a vicious cycle. Realize that shit happens, you're only human. A mistake at the office is nothing more than a mistake and you shouldn't view it as a \"My boss hates me\" situation. There are always going to be problems and mistakes, that's life. Don't let your brain play up fuck ups into something more than what they are. We all make them, nobody is perfect even if they seem to be.\n\n* The book \"The Subtle Art of Not Giving a Fuck\" is an absolute life changer and if you're anxiety is ruining you, you should read it. No lie. Nothing makes me feel better in the morning than this book and coffee.\n\nI'm not coming in here to say small things will fix your problem, but they make a huge difference in your mental outlook for the day. Take care of yourself.",

            "selftext": "I just left the school I had gone to for 8 years because of medical issues and no one there remembers my birthday, at least not to my knowledge. Not even my dad told me happy birthday on the right day. He told me happy birthday yesterday and I guess he saw his mistake and texted me again happy birthday. Now since I\u2019m so anxious and depressed this made me cry myself to sleep last night. The worst part is that we aren\u2019t even going out to where I want to go tonight, so I want to to go to a restaurant well call bees but my family has a gift card to another restaurant so we are going to go there but I guess on the bright side I am going to get to go to the bookstore after we eat. I know some of this sounds petty but just if this happened to you on your birthday you would get it. But I don\u2019t care  that my mom hasn\u2019t gotten me a gift or that we aren\u2019t going out o where I want to eat, I care that no one cares and no one remembers. Its just on top of everything else I feel lonely and horrible for feeling this way that i make myself cry instead of celebrate. Thank you for listening and thank you even more if you haven\u2019t judged me. I\u2019m sorry if a similar situation has happened to you, you have my best wishes. I get if you judge me I would judge me because of how petty I sound. I\u2019m sorry.\nEdit: Adding this I\u2019m 16. Also for context four people said happy birthday to me my brother, who didn\u2019t even come to hug me or say it to my face just screamed it, my mom who did kiss me, my dad who texted me and one girl who texted me.",
