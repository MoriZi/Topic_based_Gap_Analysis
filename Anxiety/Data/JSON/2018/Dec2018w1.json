I only drive to familiar distances maybe 15-20 minutes away and I never take the highway. I work remotely but every now and then my boss will ask me to come into the office. So far I have managed to either get a ride to work, or I'll take an uber. But uber is so expensive and I have a license now so theres no reason I should pay half of my work day on an uber. It is tempting though..... \n\nI also feel much more comfortable working from home as my boss is not watching my every move/listening to me make phone calls etc) so when I get asked to come in its dreadful. I get anxious about how I am going to get to and from work, and to think once I arrive there I'll be stuck there all day.  I know that the only way to beat this anxiety is to drive more, but id rather spend more money on an uber and be less anxious than drive to work even though avoiding it isnt helping me in the long run. \n\nI hope I can get over this one day.

At rush hour\u2026 I was going with a friend I haven\u2019t seen since high school, and obviously large crowds. But honestly, I didn\u2019t feel a shred of anxiety the entire night, in fact it was the best night of my life and the happiest I\u2019ve been in years. I screamed my lungs out and jumped and moshed so much that my voice is still missing, I\u2019m still sore and finding bruises in weird places but for the first time in YEARS I felt fucking free. When I look back on the few videos I took I can\u2019t help but to smile and get goosebumps because I really was having such an amazing time. I conquered my fears of driving to LA, I\u2019m reconnecting with old friends who I\u2019ve missed so damn much, I saw the greatest boyband in the motherfucking world, and I\u2019ve made a huge breakthrough with my mental health. \n\nI feel like going outside of my house, I feel like hanging out with people again, I feel like I have my boundaries back, and even though I\u2019m still stressed as shit with college I realize there\u2019s more to my life than just that stress and I\u2019m fucking alive. I\u2019m also getting my septum pierced for my birthday this Friday, which is something I\u2019ve wanted to do for YEARS but I\u2019ve always been too scared to.\n\nI\u2019m rambling now, but even though I still do get anxious and depressed and fucked up I\u2019m making progress in therapy and in my life and I\u2019m just so fucking excited to not be sitting passively anymore.

            "selftext": "Hi. For the past month I've been experiencing very scary symptoms. It is making it almost impossible for me to go about my daily tasks and social settings with work and being with my roommate/friends. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**A little bit of background of how this all started before I get into the details:** \n\nI just graduated college and got my degree in accounting this past May and have moved to a very fun city mid June. I soon found a job shortly after moving. Everything was going great, my roommate (who I met my senior year of college) and all of our friends who moved down here after graduation were having a blast. Going to concerts, the bars, etc. I am a very social guy, love being around people and am always the life of the party. I love bringing people together. About a month into this job I unexpectedly get fired. I received no feedback what so ever and was pretty shocked that they decided to part ways with me after such a short time. Especially for a new grad. Luckily, I am pretty tenacious and found a new (current) accounting job about two weeks later.  I was enjoying this new job, doing well, we were all still having an amazing time. Then, it all started out of absolutely nowhere. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**The symptoms:**\n\nI think this happened a little bit before Halloween. I woke up for work one day and felt...different. I still feel like this way to this day and it has not subsided. I felt extremely numb and dizzy all the time. Everything is echoing and everything seems so distant. My surroundings look extremely vivid, way more than usual. Everything is brighter. The absolute scariest symptom for me so far is lack of comprehension. People will be talking to me sometimes and their words will sound kind of muffled to me and not make any sense. I think they are saying completely different things than what they are actually saying. Sometimes I think people are talking and saying my name even though they are not. This has happened at work many times and at home and any other social setting. It doesn't sound like my voice when I talk. It sounds separate from my body and not like it is coming from me if that makes sense. I can't comprehend stuff I am reading sometimes as well, it will take me a long time to make sense of it sometimes. Sometimes I will see brief shadows out of the corner of my eye. Things in my peripheral also seem like they are moving extremely fast, but when I look, they slow down. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**What I have done about this:**\n\nI am very lucky to have such open and loving parents. I have told them everything about my situation and they are worried but very understanding and are trying to give me advice, \"it's all in your head, etc.\" I understand that, but when I had anxious thoughts in my mind before this all happened, it would subside quickly. This has been going on for a month so I am beginning to think it is something more serious than my thoughts. I have also seen a doctor twice in the past month and told her all her symptoms. They took blood/urine samples and everything was normal. This past Friday she prescribed me 50mg of Zoloft and is setting me up for counseling with a therapist. I know I won't feel the effects of Zoloft for at least two weeks. I have also stopped smoking weed and am limiting myself to two beers for the rare occasions that I do go out these days. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**In conclusion:**\n\nIt feels like I am living a permanent acid trip and I am absolutely terrified. I am so scared being at work hunkered down in my cubicle. Nothing seems real to me and I am worried someone might think that I am going crazy. My personality has changed significantly. I am more paranoid then ever and am secluding myself from social situations. I am afraid to interact with people anymore because nothing makes sense to me and nothing seems real. I am worried this is my new state of mind and I will be like this for ever. I am just reaching out to see if anyone else has experienced this and would be willing to give me some insight. Thank you!",

            "selftext": "Hey r/anxiety. 23yo female, long time generalized anxiety sufferer since I was about 10yo. I've seen people spill their guts here and I think it would be cathartic to do so. I feel trapped in my own mental illness.\n\nI have PTSD from a severely abusive relationship  (physically, sexually, and emotionally) with a man that lasted through 4 of my teen years. I turned to weed to cope. My PTSD intensified and caused a fear of law enforcement when I was by caught with weed and arrested and put on probation for 2 years. Part of the requirements of my probation was a 3 day stay in jail. This jailtime was traumatizing because, in my anxiety during the intake, I said I self harm. This caused them to strip me and keep me in a foam padded cell with no mattress/bedding with nothing but a Velcro dress for all 3 days.\n\nDuring this time, I was going to college for Elementary Education. I love children and it was my dream to teach. I had to jump through hoops to not be penalized for my criminal background. I continued with the teacher program. My lawyer worked out that it would be removed from my record once I finished probation. That happened this summer and I am pleased to say that my record is clean. Yet, my anxiety persists. That dehumanizing experience will stay with me forever.\n\nThis January, I had a very tough breakup with a woman (I'm bisexual) who I had been in a relationship with for 2 years following my previous abusive one. She essentially broke up with me because of my out-of-control mental illness. We don't talk, and to this day I miss her and am torn up about it. She was only my second long term relationship and the first one to treat me right.\n\nAround the same time as our breakup, I started student-teaching as the last part of my degree program. I taught a difficult class last semester and an even harder class this semester. I have SEVERE performance related anxiety, so the entire experience has been a struggle for me. Feeling like I'm not a good teacher, like they don't listen to me, and like people are constantly not judging/dissatisfied with me. I feel this way even though I get good feedback. \n\nThere is a light at the end of this tunnel though, because my last day student teaching is this coming Thursday. I will be graduating on December 15th with my Elementary Education degree. \n\nWhy then, am I still a completely anxious mess?\n\nMy sweet dog dislocated her kneecap (apparently a common problem in small breeds) and she needs major orthopedic surgery to put a plate in her knee. We have had her evaluated but haven't been able to schedule the surgery because of money. She is on anti-inflammatory and sometimes it pips back into place, but I feel so guilty and anxious every time I see her limping around.\n\nMost recently giving me a whirlwind of anxiety,  mom, my only support system, is now having her own crisis. We just got news that her mother (my grandmother) is not likely to recover well from her last heart surgery. It's looking like the end is coming sooner than we thought. I am not as close to my grandma, because she we didn't talk for years. Of course I still love her and my mom. I am trying to be strong for my mom, because she's always been there for me, but it's taking its toll on me. I feel so selfish that I can't put aside my own anxiety so that I can help her more.\n\nMy anxiety is a living hell. I can't enjoy the things I used to anymore. I can't step back and objectively judge that things are going to okay. I can't turn my mind off for 2 seconds. I feel like there is no end in sight for this living nightmare. \n\nAnyway, thank you for letting me get that off my chest. I don't know what I was hoping for, but I just needed someone to listen. I feel like such a low life with so little to offer. Thanks so much for anyone who made it this far, or any kind words you can offer. I love this community so much. \n\nI'm off to listen to some ASMR to feel like I'm not alone in this world.",

I get so worried about being able to get an erection and pleasing the woman I\u2019m with that I think about it alot, I feel very ocdish over it. I feel if I eat any bad food at all, it\u2019s going to screw me up trying to get it up. Deep down I know it won\u2019t, I\u2019m healthy and exercise a lot and eat relatively clean and don\u2019t have a problem once it comes time but at the same time I can\u2019t stop focusing on it in my normal day being worried that this or that will affect my performance. \n\nWondering if you guys have any advice for something like this?

            "selftext": " Earlier this year, my brother-in-law decided to get a guard dog and playmate for his girlfriend's pit bull. (Note: girlfriend's pit bull is a big spoiled baby who wants to be friends with everyone. Not exactly intimidating.) \n\n He ended up getting a dog off of the internet. He didn't realize until much later that the dog most likely had come from an abusive home. The dog has issues with peeing despite being past puppyhood, severe separation anxiety and is extremely submissive. I've also noticed that he always drinks water like he's been in the desert for years. \n\n My BIL doesn't have the time or temperament to train these behaviors out of him and after months of having him, the dog started \"marking his territory\" over all their stuff. My BIL has always said (half joking/ half serious) that if he ever had to give up this dog, he'd rather that we take him. Well BIL decided last week that he couldn't take it anymore and asked if we could take him. He gave us all the dog's stuff and as of a couple days ago, we have a dog. \n\n Now, my husband and I love dogs but neither of us has ever had to take care of a dog ourselves. He's a very sweet boy and we do have the space and are within walking distance of a dog park. Both my husband and I are pretty active despite our full time jobs and we are trying our best to give him a good home. \n\n But I really don't know if I'll be able to deal with him. We still have to crate him before we leave the house for any length of time. He has to be taken out constantly and we have to monitor his water intake. We have a cat who currently hates him. I'm just kind of feeling overwhelmed right now at the prospect of suddenly having a dog like this. \n\nAny advice or kind words would be appreciated. \n\n",

I also want to, like, call and come over to his house during the week, so he doesn't have to feel alone all time, just share the pain in silence. \n\nHowever, I fear I will take no action due to my worries.

            "selftext": "And I\u2019m anxious as fuck\n\nI saw one at the store- my favorite brand, Santa Monica in pink and I thought it was awesome but it was 70 dollars and I was so anxious to buy it. My first board.\n\nBackground- I\u2019ve been looking into skateboarding on and off for seven years now but I\u2019ve always been scared of falling off and dying or going into a coma or just not being good, so I always tried to find away around getting a skateboard. \n\nBut today, I realized a book of mine sold. \n\nSo I was there at the store for 45 minutes and I couldn\u2019t buy the board. I don\u2019t have a steady income ( I play music on the street sometimes and sell art + I am a university student) \n\nI was relieved I didn\u2019t spend the money, but I felt so bad for not getting a board. I\u2019m almost 20 my best skating years might be down the drain already. I never even tried it. \n\nSo I went on amazon and got a 40 dollar skateboard (Minority complete skateboard) and I was glad, but I also feel like an idiot because I KNOW how shitty cheap decks can be and I am so scared of failing to skate. I haven\u2019t been this worried to fail since I was a little kid in the GT program at school and AHHH. \n\nI feel damned either way, but I needed to get this out there. Maybe, if I like it, I can get a nicer skateboard. \n\nI just think I should be saving money I feel awful. \n\nI mean, I\u2019m not in any major shortage, but I don\u2019t want to be I\u2019m so scared to be without a little hoard of money. I get so anxious spending because when I was younger my parents moved around a lot and we often went without food and that shit was scary. \n\nI also have to buy my medication without my parents knowing because if they know they\u2019d be so mad at me, so I pay out of pocket. \n\nAll that being said, I am so excited I want to try to Ollie.  I also kind of want to throw up. Spending more than 30 dollars on a single purchase makes my chest cave into itself.\n",

I was diagnosed with gallstones over a year ago. I know that the most common (extremely common, no big deal, etc etc) solution is surgery. \n\nWhen I went to the hospital, they scheduled me for Wednesday, the 5th. \n\nOkay, so despite everyone telling me how it will be okay, I\u2019m just terrified of general anesthetic, being incubated, recovery, if something goes wrong, all that fun stuff. I\u2019m obese, so I\u2019m partly scared that I\u2019m at a higher risk for something to go wrong. I have no choice but a small hospital with only a couple surgeons, so I\u2019m freaked out about that. Just every little thing, you know?\n\nI feel pretty much paralyzed by fear, like I currently am not doing anything. All day long I\u2019m sitting and googling about what could go wrong. \n\nSo if anyone has any comforting words or experiences to share, I appreciate it and thank you so much. ",

Feeling like I\u2019m going to faint anytime I\u2019m seeing one of my favorite bands in concert, or starting to panic meeting my boyfriends wonderful family. I just want to enjoy life without having to worry about the next time I\u2019m going to have a panic attack",
