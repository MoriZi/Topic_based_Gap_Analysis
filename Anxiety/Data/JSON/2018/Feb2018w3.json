But last night I worked pretty hard and came home extremely tired and was sure i was going to fall right asleep when I got into bed. But when I did to to sleep, it was like my heartbeat wouldn't slow down and i could feel it throughout my entire body for hours and hours all night. Now i usually have trouble sleeping cuz my mind won't shut off but not this weird heartbeat problem too. It was so aggravating, but maybe it was all in my head? If so, how do I make it go away? I tried meditation, but trying to keep still makes me more anxious. And I usually have to wiggle my foot or tap my fingers to get the energy out till I fall asleep. But that didn't seem to help either. ",

            "selftext": "Today started out as a normal Friday at work. I was almost done putting the order away when my department manager come back and tells everyone to start cleaning up and trying to make everything look perfect all because she found out this guy from the company was coming in for a visit. Usually I avoid these situations at all cost and will pick the job that there is a lesser chance of me having to be acknowledged by the man. Not because he is a bad guy, just because I freak out and think I am going to do something stupid. But today was different. I just continued to work like it was nothing. \n\nAs he walked in our department I could feel the tension between everyone. Basically they wanted this over with because of the pressure they were putting on themselves.   For some reason there was 2 bundles of star balloons behind me as I was working. I ignored them because I am guessing they had some purpose. Well, it was my turn. He was making his way through and finally saw me. He said \u201c hi, nice to meet you. Are you the star of the day?\u201d As he reached out his hand. Obviously, in reference to the giant balloons behind me. Without hesitation I shook his hand and said \u201ceveryday\u201d. \n\nIt finally broke the tension in the department and everyone including him enjoyed it. I went from someone that would never even say a word to this man 2 years ago to someone that showed confidence while approaching him. I\u2019m going to call this a win today. ",

Then the more wired and hypersensitive I become, the more depressed I feel. It's a viscous cycle.\n\nToday I got home from work and I'd had a busy day. But forced myself to take my youngest for a long walk. She's very energetic and chatty so it just made it easier. If already walked 4 miles during the day and we walked another three. Tomorrow I'm going to do a longer walk and build it up.\n\nWalking definitely helps anxiety! It's just sometimes hard to get motivated enough to get out..",

Everyday is just another worry. Anxiety effects millions of people everyday. And maybe if we didn't have people going \"oh man up\", we wouldn't have mentally crazed killers. Anxiety is a real thing, don't ignore it.\n\nI think a big thing is because they think people are always looking for attention. I common thing with people that suffer from anxiety is they are always looking for a reassurance to attempt to put their worries to rest.",
