            "selftext": "Alright this will be a long one, just a bit of background info about me as I just discovered this sub. Ill try and make it as short as possible. It will seem messy and all over the place because it is lol. \n\nI am 19, male.\n\nAt the age of two I pulled a pot of boiling chicken broth off of the counter and it spilled all over my right arm and chest. 3rd degree burns and a year of being fed via a feeding tube. Years later probably around the age of 10 I started seeing a psychiatrist who prescribed me with 3 pills (i think one was zoloft, sorry cant remember the names of em) and was diagnosed with PTSD, ADD, ADHD, and bipolar (which was further tested to be untrue.) At the time I was afraid of swallowing pills, so I just crushed them up, which made me gag every time I took the pills (2 in morning one at night.) Eventually (over 6 year span) I effectively weaned myself off of the pills because the taste was so terrible, and I never felt like they helped me. I even would fake taking them when the nurse at a summer camp \"watched\" me take them. \n\n\nStart of my \"history\" with school: \n\nMiddle school: Got good grades, would constantly go to the nurse and try and get sent home. \n\n9th grade: started in (lets call it school A, public school) and did TERRIBLY, never put ANY work in, got awful grades and feared going so bad I began to have panic attacks.            \n\nSecond semester of 9th grade: tried online school, got distracted while working at home, couldnt do it... Also, didnt get enough credits to move into 10th, effectively failing 9th grade.\n\n9th grade round 2: I am fortunate enough to have parents that could send me to a private school, where I did O.K... I hated every day of it, and hated everything about it but got good grades in most classes (failed a few like bible classes) and still put no work in, didnt even study. Still had panic attacks about going and skipped 1-2 days a week. \n\n10th-11th: same as ^ but after tonsillectomy in early january of 11th grade, i was given \"2-3 weeks\" of medical absences by the doctor. I fell behind, and started to get anxious about catching up, plus my grades from the previous semester werent great, showing a possibility of failing 11th grade. I freaked, panic attacks galore. Dropped out of the private school. \n\n11-12th: started in a \"twilight program\" at my local votec, basically a joke of a course meant to be a final step to prevent people from dropping out. It was all online, and to be honest, i cheated on parts of it. I completed two years of it in a year and a half, and was given my high school diploma. \n\n\nNow, (2018)I have enrolled in classes at the community college. I am a freshman, currently attending a writing class and an algebra class. ( i have two mini classes too that start in a week, only half a semester long) Lets start off with the math class. I have always been a math guy. At first, the class was easy( or so I thought) then we recieved our first test which I got a solid 46 on. After that I missed a class day because I was sick, and now I am taking every excuse I can find not to go. Same goes for my writing class: A lot more work with this class, an essay every 2 weeks, weekly grammar assignments (it sounds like a lot(jk), but it isnt, im just a lazy idiot!) and other daily homework assignments. \n\nPart of the issue with college right now is that I forgot the math stuff I knew, and I have never ever been good at english. Also with the english class the teacher calls on each student to give their answer to whatever question was on the assignment, meaning that you have no clue if your answer is correct. I am terrible at english, I dont even know my parts of speech or whatever, so I constantly make myself look like an idiot giving the complete wrong answer... which gives me anxiety about attending class, making me fall behind in all of those assignments I was talking about earlier. \n \nMy college has FREE math tutoring with my math professor but I am too fearful he will call me out on missing so much class and not comming in to get tutoring sooner... \n\n\nOther info...\n\nI saw a psychiatrist for about 7 years, and a therapist for 10-12, still see her a few times a year. \n\nI live with my parents, oldest of 4 siblings. \n\nI applied for a job over the summer, and got the first one I applied to. It was as a dish/prep guy at a ale house type place. Lasted 5 days, quit in the moment because of my anxiety to break down the dish machine, mainly quit because it was a shit job and I had no clue what I was getting myself into. Started at 12.50 an hour, but they had me working prep AND dish with 1 other dude in a restaurant of 800 ppl, it was insaine.\n\n\nUhh feel free to ask me literally anything if youve made it this far. Also feel free to be brutally honest. I need it. Thanks.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

This caused me to stop therapy after only two months.\n\nI know it sounds stupid, but the part of therapy that made me uncomfortable was that I wasn\u2019t able to bring myself to talk about my issues. I fully trusted my therapist and she was incredibly understanding to me but I was just afraid to tell her anything that I deemed \u201ctoo personal\u201d  about my anxiety. The idea of letting my guard down to anyone, even a licensed professional, terrifies me because I\u2019m afraid of their reactions towards what I have to say. I was afraid that my therapist, who\u2019s job is literally to help my and not judge me, was going to react poorly to what I had to say. \n\nAs a result of this habit, instead of talking about the real things that are troubling me I ended up spending most of my appointments watching the clock and lying about having simpler problems so I didn\u2019t have to address the main problems. (this is the exact opposite of what you\u2019re supposed to do in therapy, I know, I just couldn\u2019t bring myself to be honest with her). This obviously caused me to make extremely minimal progress.\n\nI want to help my anxiety. I just do not think I can bring myself to go to therapy again because I\u2019m almost certain this scenario will repeat itself.  \n\nIs there anything I can do to get through the causes of my anxiety without having to go to a therapist??",

            "selftext": "#Background\n\n15(M) in the UK. I have selective mutism, I am only able to speak to my parents and siblings. Nobody else. I have four friends, only one of which who invites me to something (only his birthday once a year). I also have autism, which helps me academically but not socially in school, which at this point is the only thing that I have in life. But the idea of never being able to use my skills due to anxiety and huge lack of social skills is worrying.\n\n\n#Story\n\nI've had this problem my whole life. So due to anxiety I had to get a 1-1 throughout all of primary school (which starts from when you're 3 until you're 11). The problem was was that they changed 1-1 every so often so whenever I got more comfortable, boom. Back to square one. This repetition for six years straight only made it worse, changing my routine constantly causing stress. So after that. \n\nI didn't really hear anything until year 9 (13) when they decided to get a teacher (who had success with a girl with SM in the past) to give me therapy. It felt like they were only there to pressure me to talk to them, which made me less comfortable as her goal was to get me to speak to her as quick as possible. Not small steps like saying \"hi\" to someone you walk past on the street. It was so pressuring that only after a few weeks of this she left the room and attempted to force me to speak into a audio recorder. I froze, sitting there for I don't know how long. When they found out that it isn't that easy, they returned to relaxation methods. And then realised they can't relax me into it and just gave up. I haven't seen the since.\n\n During the holiday between year 10 and 11 (15), I found out symptoms about autism, then found that I had been diagnosed (similar time to when my dad told me that why I couldn't speak was because of a named disorder). This tipped me over the edge. I couldn't belive that my parents would hide this from me for so long. I fell into a pit. I felt trapped, like I will never be able to act normal. 15 years  of not being able to communicate, means 15 years on possible training for social skills (and counting).\n\nAt first I only focused on the positives, the things which help me. Then I found more and more negatives for autism. I could relate to most of them. I was discussing ways to commit suicide, but at the same time thinking that I can't do it. I've heard too many people say it's not an escape, I will make everyone upset, I could have a bright future. Who knows? But I couldn't get the thoughts out of my head. Feeling hopeless, I kept these thoughts in my head and struggled as mcuh as I can to hold back the tears (unless I know I would be alone). \n\n\n**Currently**\n\nAt this point, I'm only getting amusement out of youtube and social media. It helps me forget about it. But the. I have days where its on my mind and I can't get rid of it. I find (luckily) that I have no idea where to start to even attempt suicide.\n\nI have 4 friends, but wouldn't call 3 of them that. Only one attempts to talk to me, invites me to things he does (which isnt that often because he's lonely also) because since I don't speak he often wants at least one other person there. (story time). On at Least 3 occasions in the past 2 years, the 3 'friends' I was talking about earlier talk about the things they did together the night before, then turn to me and ask, \"why didn't you come\".. I was never invited or even knew about it. \n\nMy parents don't know about me knowing about my autism, they don't know about most of this. I get a weird feeling everytime I talk about things like this with them, I don't like it. I don't like the way they act in situations like this. *(For example, I did something that I wouldn't normally do, something minor, and they over emphasised a shocked face.)* but I'm not, and may never be, prepared to tell them. \n\n[Finished for now, I may add more later] ",

            "selftext": "Hi all.\n\nI've suffered from what I can only describe as social and sometimes general anxiety throughout my whole life. I dropped out of college because my anxiety was so bad. I hated every moment I was there. \n\nI'm only in my early 20's and have had a handful of job roles since leaving school. I've worked in a small shop, McDonald's, and just recently a job at the college Library.\n\nWorking in the small shop, my anxiety only really got bad during very busy periods, but that was pretty rare so most the time I was okay. It was a very relaxed atmosphere.\n\nAt McDonald's, my anxiety went through the roof. I found it extremely hard to stay calm during every shift, and when I wasn't working I was worrying about having to go to work. I ended up quitting a few months in cause I couldn't get on the bus to work from the panic.\n\nNow, although my job isn't nearly as hectic (and I enjoy my general role so much more), I still find myself getting very anxious when the Library is full of students. Telling students to be quiet or to stop messing around is the part that I just cannot handle. I want to do my job right but the anxiety makes it so hard. I'm getting scared of desk shifts because it's such a busy period right now.\n\nI can't help but feel like every job I'm in, this will become a problem. I'd love a job which involved zero interaction with others but those jobs are hard to come by for full time roles, unless it's something like a more advanced IT/tech role.\nThanks for reading. I don't feel like I can really talk to anyone about it because they'll think I'll want to quit again.",

            "selftext": "Hi! I just really wanted to share this and ask if anyone has any thoughts or experience with anything similar.   \nSo just to put it short, i feel very uncomfortable when i am around people and some music is playing, sometimes the most generic pop song makes me feel like i am suffocating, only when there are people around tho, otherwise i would turn it off. But in all seriousness it does not bother me when i am alone, then i just get annoyed and turn it off. Mostly emotional songs, but generic, tearjerker songs.. all that kind of stuff makes me want to throw the radio in a pit of lava. I do love music in general and i actually sing/rap and produce music myself as well and enjoy many different types of music, and sometimes some songs are fine to listen to with people, easiest ones are songs with no words.   \nAnyone have any ideas or similar experiences please do share!  \nThank you so much for reading and your time!",

            "selftext": "Thank you for reading. I hope this doesn't get too confusing cuz there's a lot of stuff I want to explain so you know my whole situation, but it might not all be relevant.\n\nI'm 19. More than month ago I noticed that I'd been having borderline diarrhea every day. Later on I started waking up in the morning with what felt like bad hunger pains that made me nauseous and the nausea made me not want to eat. At this point it wasn't too bad, though. I don't know exactly when this started because I think it gradually worsened until I noticed it.\n\nPossibly relevant: About 3/4 the way through my senior year last year, I started smoking weed occasionally, and when summer came along, I'd indulge most nights.\n\nBack to the story. September 14 I went to see my long distance girlfriend for the weekend. By this time I had already noticed those symptoms. Since I hadn't seen her in a while I was a little nervous to have sex with her and when we were about to, I felt quite nervous in my stomach and really gassy so I said I didn't feel good. I've always been really calm and collected but in situations where I'm justifiably nervous (like before public speaking) I get that stomach feeling, get really gassy, and sometimes get the shits. I thought about this and it is then that I got the idea in my head that maybe anxiety was causing my diarrhea. After going back home my symptoms got worse and I realized that I felt that \"butterflies in the stomach\" feeling all the time. After looking more into anxiety disorders the more I thought it could be the cause.\n\nI was still smoking weed most nights but for 4 days I hadn't. In these 4 of not smoking days I got full on sick and my morning nauseous had me throwing up, my gas pains were really bad, I had a headache and I felt sore. I told my friend to bring me some weed cuz it might give me an appetite and make me feel better. That worked really well. I went from throwing up in the morning and feeling awful to barely noticing anything.\n\nBut, then I had another thought. What if weed was causing my diarrhea and at the same time, easing my discomfort? So, last Monday, 10/7, I stopped smoking and haven't since. And, wouldn't you know it, over the last week, diarrhea has gone, no morning nausea. What's stayed is this nervousness. The feeling in my stomach never goes away. It's like when you think about something you're excited for and your stomach does a flip, only there's nothing I'm excited for or dreading. I feel restless and find myself pacing around.\n\nI think it's possible that I am in fact anxious that I could have anxiety; that it could be self-perpetuating. If this is it, how can I cut this cycle? If that's not the case, what could it be?",
