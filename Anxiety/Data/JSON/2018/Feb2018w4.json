            "selftext": "So I've had really severe anxiety and panic attacks for about 6 years. Sometimes it was manageable, sometimes not. During the last half of last year it was really escalating to a point where it was worse than before, peaking around Christmas. I was having panic attack after panic attack which was very unusual, and taking a lot more Xanax than I ever needed to before. So I looked around the area and found a local hospital that had an anxiety &amp; OCD program, supposedly one of the best in the country. \n\n\nMost of what the program focused on was exposure therapy and CBT. I feel like exposure therapy is rarely discussed here, yet it seems to be one of the most common methods among the psych community for dealing with anxiety. So here's kind of a simple break down on what they teach.\n\n\n#Exposure\n***\n\n**Create an exposure program**- This is the hardest part and something that was foreign to me when I began the program. The intent of this is to expose yourself to what gives you anxiety, so that after repeated exposures the anxiety will lessen over time. So the first thing you want to do is to make a \"hierarchy of anxiety triggers\". You want to make a list of your trigger, whether you avoid it, and how much anxiety it gives you on a scale of 1-10, as such:\n\n**Hierarchy** (People, places, thoughts, things, sensations)\n\n\nTrigger | Avoided? (yes/no) | Anxiety (0-10)\n:--|:--:|--:\nRiding in an elevator | Yes  | 5\nShowering | No | 4\n\nThis will help in creating your exposure program, as you want to begin with exposures that are lower on your hierarchy. If you start at a 10 trigger, you may not be able to handle sitting with that anxiety. You want to start with a couple triggers that are lower, like 2 or 3, where you can handle that level of anxiety and learn to handle these exposures. \n\nSo take an exposure, for example, maybe you have terrible anxiety about driving. Break it down into steps, it's better to include more steps, and smaller ones than you may really beed. If you do a step and it produces little or no anxiety, then move on right away to the next step. Maybe the first step you just sit in the car in your garage or driveway with the door open. Then you move on to closing the door, then adding the key to the ignition, then run the engine, drive to the end of the driveway and back again. You would then move on to driving onto the street, then back to the driveway, and so on and so forth. \n\nThe point is that with each step, if it produces a decent amount of anxiety then your goal is to sit with that anxiety, until it comes down to about half of its original intensity. It doesn't sound fun, but you want your anxiety to go up, that's the entire point of the exercise. You will feel uncomfortable, and that's fine, that's the point. After repeated exposures that level of discomfort and anxiety will lessen. \n\nHere are some other examples- people with social anxiety would go up to people and make small talk, or talk in our group sessions for their exposure work. \n\nAnother exposure quite a few of us would do is write out 'worst case scenarios'. This could be writing out a detailed scenario where maybe you die from a heart attack, or where you write out an idea of making a fool of yourself in front of others, or someone you love dies. You want to be as detailed as possible, you write it, then read it and imagine it, see if it gives you anxiety and then sit with it. Then you would do a worksheet about your worst case scenario(posted down a bit further) and reframe your thoughts about this possible scenario.\n\n\n\n\n**Panic exposures (interoceptives)**\n***\n\nIf you suffer from panic attacks, the goal of this type of exposure is to try and recreate the physical sensations you may experience during an intense panic attack. Again the intent is that repeated exposure to these sensations will make you more accustomed to them, and make you less anxious when you experience them. If you have had an intense panic attack you know a lot of the common physiological manifestations- dizziness, feeling out of breath, increased HR, palpitations, sweating, shaking, cold chills, hot flashes, nausea, etc. \n\nSo here is a list of interoceptives you can do to try and recreate symptoms that are similar to what you personally experience during a panic attack:\n\n-Shake head from side to side for 30 seconds\n-Place head between legs for 30 seconds\n-Run in place for 1 minute\n-Hold breath for 30 seconds\n-Breathe through a large straw for 1 minute\n-Breathe through a small straw for 1 minute\n-Spin for 1 minute\n-Do push ups for 1 minute\n-Hyperventilate for 1 minute\n-Tense your muscles for 1 minute\n-Put books on your chest for 1 minute\n\nSo you could do all of these, and then rate the intensity of the sensations you felt and how much fear it creates, and whether or not it's similar to the feelings you get during a natural panic attack. For instance:\n\nExercise | Sensations | Intensity 1-10 | Fear 1-10 | Similar 1-10\n:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|\n\n\nSo you choose those which give you anxiety, and sit with it. Give yourself some time in between, then repeat. You do these until these physical sensations give you less and less anxiety. \n\n\n\n\n**CBT**\n***\n\nEssentially what CBT boils down to is changing your thoughts and actions(or behaviors) in situations. How you interpret and perceive the situation or object of your anxiety determines your discomfort. You can't avoid all situations and anxieties, so your goal is to fix your perception and attitude.\n\nWhat you can do is work on CBT worksheets to evaluate your anxiety, and your thoughts about them. We want to examine these thoughts and behaviors, and then work to reframe these thoughts. This is the worksheet we used: https://imgur.com/a/m23WO . There are many other type of worksheets you can find online as well. You can do these worksheets with any type of trigger you have, examine the trigger with a critical eye, and work toward reframing your thoughts when you have a trigger. Much of this we know won't work when you're in the grips of a full panic attack, but the point of this is to nip your anxiety in the bud before it gets to that point. Identifying cognitive distortions and moving away from anxiety will become second nature when you do more and more CBT worksheets.\n\n\n\n\n**Things to Remember**\n***\n\n**Your goal is not to eliminate anxiety completely** - This is something you may not think about, or goes against what you think you want, but anxiety is a natural and integral part of life. Without fear or anxiety, you would approach a grizzly bear in the wild and try to pet it. We need anxiety, and we need to learn to live with it. \n\n**Anxiety won't kill you** - Anxiety is a normal human response our ancestors needed for survival, it will not kill you. It will make you uncomfortable, but it will not kill you. You're not going to go crazy, you're not going to die. \n\n**Relaxation** - A good way to help calm yourself is to practice relaxation techniques habitually. There are various methods to achieve a relaxed state- abdominal deep breathing, meditation, progressive muscle relaxation, visualizing a peaceful scene. Like everything else, you must dedicate time to these behaviors to reap the positive results. Physiological responses to relaxation include a decrease in HR, BP, muscle tension, oxygen consumption, analytical thinking, etc. Relaxation works to prevent stress from becoming cumulative, boiling over into anxiety attacks or increasing your generalized anxiety.  \n\n**What NOT to do**\n***\n\n**Seek reassurance** - I would often do this with my health anxiety or panic attacks. I would check my BP or HR, my wife would comfort me, I would go to the ER. These are all ways to seek reassurance, and they are not good for you. \n\nI often see comments in this forum about a loved one giving comfort and telling the person suffering with anxiety that \"they will be OK\", they shouldn't. You should tell your loved ones not to reassure you. Receiving reassurance doesn't work, and it doesn't help in the long term. \n\nAnother way of reassurance is having support objects. Maybe you carry Xanax with you wherever you go, I did for years. Or I would always have my phone nearby in case I need to call 911 because I have a fear of suddenly dying or suffering a catastrophic medical emergency. Or I would always wear shoes in the house in case something crazy happened and I needed to be ready to go right then and there. These are all examples of relying on support objects, you falsely believe they protect you and you start to depend on them. This is another step where you need to start gradually eliminating the need to carry your support objects, you can and will survive without them. This leads me into the next point...\n\n**Try to eliminate all uncertainty** - Nothing in life is certain, and we have to learn to accept that. It's funny what we have anxieties about, and what we don't. I am a young healthy person, but I have had unrelenting health anxiety where I think I'm going to die, yet perplexingly driving in my car doesn't give me anxiety. This makes no sense! Driving is the most dangerous and possibly fatal activity I do on a daily basis, but I don't give it a second thought! You and I may not be here tomorrow, or in an hour, life is uncertain, it's something you need to learn to live with. A lot of anxiety is about things we can't control, what may or may not happen. What if, what if, what if. Ground yourself to your present moment. Identify objects in your room, take deep breaths, feel the fabric of the chair you're sitting in, smell the scent of the air. You're here, right now, in this moment, be there. What comes will come.\n\n**Distractions** - Sometimes when I used to get really anxious I would play a video game. This would take my mind off my anxiety and distract me, I thought this was a great method. This is not the case. If your attention is engaged elsewhere then you don't have to worry about your anxiety. Except this leads to a point where all you think you have to do is think the \"wrong\" thing and panic or anxiety may set in. Essentially distractions are just a form of avoidance...\n\n**Avoidance** - Avoidance is a huge one, and one we probably all have partaken in. The problem with avoidance, aside from that it doesn't work, is that your world becomes smaller and smaller and smaller. Maybe you had anxiety at the grocery store, so you avoid that grocery store. Then you had a bad attack at a family members house, so you start avoiding that house. You avoid people, places, things, activities, suddenly you're feeling isolated on an island, which of course makes your stress worse and you feel more anxious. \n\nIf you avoid all you fear, you don't get to experience what would have happened if you had encountered it. By \"protecting\" yourself against these things, you make yourself more anxious because you never overcome your fear of them. Any place or thing could soon become an avoidance, how many more will there be? You must expose yourself, you must sit with the anxiety, you can and will overcome it, or at least tolerate it. \n\n**Fight your anxiety** - In the program, my case workers always hoped I would have a bad panic attack so that they could make me sit with it. I never had one in program, but they told me they would essentially tell me \"You're having a panic attack? Ok.\". The goal is to let the anxiety come, acknowledge it, let it pass. My go-to for panic attacks was almost always the ER, that was my flight go-to response. I have had some minor ones, and now I have sat through them. I feel like I'm making progress. \n\n\n\n\n**Summary**\n***\n\nI know this isn't comprehensive and there's so much more I have, I have a folder full of printouts and info. I went for about 5 weeks. I had to take Klonopin for a while because my anxiety was so bad. I'm also now on an anti-depressant. Taking new medication would always give me awful anxiety, so even being able to do that was a big obstacle I overcame. Medication isn't always needed if you have anxiety, but for some it may help you.\n\nIf anyone has any questions, please ask, I'd be happy to share or elaborate if I can. I just wanted to write this because I so often see people talking positively about receiving reassurance, which is not good, and so little talk about exposure, which has been shown to help so much. \n\nI hope everyone's doing ok, have a good weekend!\n\nEdit: Duh, of course I have to add a healthy diet, sleep, and exercise are also so important to your physical, and mental health. This wasn't discussed as much, but just a reminder to stay active and treat your body well.",

            "selftext": "I am 29 years old, turning 30 soon. I have never had a girlfriend, I am a virgin, I have no friends, I come home to an empty apartment every night.\n\nAll throughout middle school, high school, and college, all I did was sit at home on the computer and play guitar. Barely ever went out with friends, never went to any social gatherings, never went to any school dances, etc.\n\nFast forward to now, at 29 almost 30, I am left with what I described above. I have a job that I hate, that turned out was a bait and switch. I went in thinking I would be doing one thing, and it's completely something else, but because the pay and benefits are good, and I can't find anything else, I am stuck here even though I am miserable.  My team doesn't talk to each other, everyone ignores you if you ask for any type of help,  manager is never around.  I get a sense of dread every single day I go to work, and I come home pissed every day.\n\nI only moved out of my parents house last year. For almost the past year I have been living in a 1 bedroom apartment by myself, and to be honest I hate it. I hate sitting around by myself. I have even thought about moving back to the parents.  Little things about the place make it shittier and cause me more anxiety, such as the parking situation, etc.\n\nI am so behind the curve that I don't even think there is any hope for me. At this stage, who would even want to date me? Once someone would find out my history, it would be huge red flags.\n\nI have become so used to sitting alone by myself, that I have no clue what to do even if I want to do something. I have no interest in sitting in bars or going to clubs. All I want to do is sit around and practice guitar and piano.  My idea of a good time is sitting with someone playing video games, or watching netflix/youtube and discussing what we are watching, etc.\n\nI always had an interest in producing music, but I feel like I can't focus on those things because they are isolated activities and I have this large looming cloud over me telling me I better get moving because I have no friends and girlfriend.\n\nI have been saving up for a downpayment on a house, and I'm pretty much there, but now I don't even know why I want that. A house is for a family, why the hell would I want a 3 bedroom house all to myself? Maintenance costs would be through the roof.  Why would I want a house if I'm not with anyone.\n\nI honestly don't know what I want anymore. Every single day is the exact same, go to the job I f'n despise, and then come home to an empty apartment and sit around. It's even worse in these months because it is so bitterly cold outside that there is no point in doing anything else.\n\nI honestly don't see a future for myself. I feel I am at the stage where I am beyond help. I don't see myself ever being with anyone, and I will just become someone who's office job is all they have. I already know my family is disappointed.\n\nMy mom actually sat me down a couple months ago and told me she was extremely worried about me because of the no girlfriend/friends thing.\n\nMy sister constantly yells at me that I am destroying my life, but her lectures just stress me out even more.\n\nMy entire life my family has done what I call \"cheap shots\" at me.  Little mental abuse situations.  Example:  I don't see the ketchup sitting on the table and go to the fridge, not seeing the ketchup i ask \"oh, we're out of ketchup?\"  to which my mom will reply \"It's sitting here on the table, what the hell are you, fucking blind?\"\n\nLittle shit like that, adds up over the years.\n\nI honestly don't think I will make it to 40 years old.\n\nI have had multiple online dating profiles for the last 8 years. I have not once had any luck. I try to make my profile as interesting as possible, soliciting feedback from people. I have not once received a reply from anyone that I message. I have even paid for these services. It has been the biggest waste of time and money.\n\nAnother thing that causes me lots of anxiety is my teeth. Cavity after cavity no matter how much I brush and floss. All the teeth in my mouth have fillings, some more than one. I even have 2 crowns. I am pretty certain I will lose all my teeth when I am older. I have been told that I might need braces. All that does is further drive me into deeper depression. I can't mentally handle possibly having braces at this age. Would make me even worse than I am in terms of looks and dating.\n\nI have a \"friend\" whom I text with a lot and he told me that he doesn't ever see me with anyone unless 1. they were a gold digger, or 2. it was a single mom with kids.\n\nDo you know how terrible that feels?\n\nI constantly overthink everything. Thinking about my hopeless future gives me terrible anxiety.  I have a feeling of dread every morning going to work, which I think are mini anxiety attacks.\n\nI posted in another subreddit about finally going to a therapist but I felt like he felt that my problems weren't real.  Saying things like \"It sounds like sitting on the computer has gotten you nowhere.  Have you thought about doing outside activities or joining groups?\"  GEEE!!! SUCH CLARITY NOW!!!\n\nThe funny thing is, is that when I'm alone on the computer I actually feel comfortable.  But deep inside I have this voice telling me that things aren't OK.\n\nDon't become me.\n\nEDIT:  Thanks for the responses.  A lot of people here say I have independence going for me but I forgot to mention that I pretty much don't.  After work I go to my parents house for dinner every night because I can't cook and that would require me to eat out every night.  On the weekends I sit at my parents all day because I have nothing else to do.  So my apartment is pretty much just a shack for me to sleep in until I have to go to work the next day.",

Please read: https://www.reddit.com/r/unpopularopinion/comments/7z5ftf/most_people_dont_know_the_truth_about_islam/\n\nThis country is so backwards is so many ways. Economically, we don't have a lot of citizens with good education and skills. We are basically 40% uneducated people without job or skill. Socially, we are very close-minded, we are anti-LGBT, anti-interfaith relationships. The government don't pursue high quality education for the citizens. Politically, religion infiltrates every aspect of politicians leading the nation, to the point that Muslim voters will only vote for Muslim politicians that leads under Muslim rules when Indonesia is not a Muslim country!\n\nI am an open-minded person with international views and believes. I am currently pursuing higher education and plan to leave the country when I can because I can't stand living here. People are so dumb and they never want to learn to be better.\n\nPeople here don't care about knowledge. They don't care about scientific truths, they just want to protect their majority religion. I'm really scared that in a few years, if I can't get out of this country, it will turn to a Muslim country. I hate this country will every fiber of my being. I hate being born here. Since I was a little girl, I never agreed to most ideals that people of this country holds. I've always had a different view that doesn't align with the majority, mostly open-minded views.",

These types of thoughts have never once helped to motivate me to make a positive change in my life. The only function of thoughts like these is to make myself suffer because the depression side of me says that I need to make myself pay for being a bad person. (Also illogical and untrue, but that voice is still there)\n\nWhat HAS been helpful are thoughts like 'Well I legitimately have an illness, that illness is a perfectly good explanation for why I have anxiety'. The less I beat myself up internally the more progress I make in my life, which honestly still doesn't make much sense to me but it's working so I'm gonna keep going with the being kind to myself thing. :)",

            "selftext": "Walking home from work makes me feel good but it leaves my mind free to wander too much so I walk while I\u2019m on my phone. I cross one street at a t-intersection with a stop sign for turning traffic, which gets really backed up at 5:00 when everyone else gets off work. So today  when I started to cross the street, I made eye contact with the driver at the stop sign then looked back down at my phone while crossing the street and continued on my way. After a few cars turned behind me, a lady yelled at me from the passenger window of a truck and said, \u201cget off your phone while crossing the street.\u201d I totally ignored her and never looked up from my phone, but I cried for a long time when I got home. That lady ruined my night and I\u2019m scared to go out in public again. Why don\u2019t people mind their own business? I was safe, I\u2019m an adult, I made eye contact with the driver who was at a complete stop, and it doesn\u2019t even matter because I have the fucking right of way anyway. ",

            "selftext": "Been single for almost 2 years. It was a bad breakup after a LTR and I had a lot of anxiety about dating and letting someone get to know me after being so broken for so long.\n\nSigned up for PoF and had a few nibbles but nothing really stuck out, or I got randos who wanted things I just wasn't ready to give. This led to more anxiety as I felt like no one wanted to see me for who I am rather than what I am.\n\nGot a message about a week ago from a guy who seemed genuinely nice and honest. We messaged off and on through the week, then yesterday I gave him my cell number, in order to take it off the site as I am forgetful and don't always check it.\n\nHe texts me asking if I wanted to go get a coffee or something last night. I debated because I was scared and worried that he wouldn't like me, would think I was too short, not the right body type, too weird, etc. All of the things that I dislike about myself.... But he must have caught me on a good day, because I said yes. We agreed to meet up at a local coffee shop.\n\nI got dressed in my best outfit, put on a little makeup, did my hair. My heart was racing the entire time and I almost backed out. My guts were rolling as the nerves set in....\n\nAnyways, I get to the shop before him, and when he shows up, I kinda acted like it was a job interview (which I'm surprisingly good at?). We chatted a while, he seemed really flustered and nervous too, which helped in an odd way. He told me up front that he was scared that I would think he was unsuitable and didn't expect me to show up at all. He told me he was incredibly attracted to me and that he thought I was stunning. (Later he said I was \"one super hot chick\"!)\n\nWe ended up taking a long walk back to his place and we hung out there for quite some time. In the back of mind, however much he told me I was safe and that he wouldn't do anything to compromise my safety, I was still nervous AF. \n\nHe gave me ample opportunity to back out. He put the ball completely in my court. I ended up staying until the wee hours (even though he wanted me to stay overnight but I said I wasn't quite ready for that yet) and we are going to take a mini roadtrip later today.\n\nAnyways, TLDR: went on my first date in 2 years with a guy even though my anxiety was telling me not to because (no) reasons, and it ended being a really great night with someone who might actually be a good aspect of my life.  Sometimes we gotta push that worry down and go against it, because something beautiful might come of it.\n\n",

            "selftext": "At work today, my co-manager was annoyed to learn that one of his employees would be out for 6 weeks on short term disability for anxiety and depression.  \n\nHe said to me \u201cI probably don\u2019t have the sympathy I should for those with mental illness.  You clearly have a very sound mind though.\u201d  \n\nA sound mind?  Little does he know, I\u2019ve had crippling anxiety for over 10 years.  I ended up in the hospital 3 times my senior year of college thinking I was dying.  I\u2019ve been on various medications the last ten years, and have managed to become very successful at the large firm I work at where I\u2019m a second level manager, although still known as the quiet, reserved guy.  I\u2019m highly introverted, highly socially anxious, have bouts of depression, daily heart palpitations, daily irritability, and have a hard time avoiding self-medicating with alcohol.  I am consumed with irrational fears (fear of time slipping away, fear of parents dying, fear of going on vacations knowing the vacation hangover will derail my mental state, fear of losing control, etc.).\n\n30 minutes before my co-manager said that to me, about how I had it all together, I was contacting a local counseling agency because I finally decided that enough is enough....I am not going to let my anxiety allow me to be mediocre and gravitate to my comfort zone anymore.  I\u2019m not going to continue in survival mode, I want to live.  I\u2019m going to get professional help, pushing aside the stigma that only the crazies get professional help.  \n\nI just found it so striking that anxiety has controlled my thoughts, actions, and life for 10 years....it has been horrendous.  Yet, I\u2019m able to mask it at work to the point where my co-manager inappropriately judges mental illness in front of me because he\u2019s so sure that I don\u2019t have it.  How many others are out there like me?  \n\nWhat a perfect example highlighting how undetected mental illness can go, how the most crippling, consuming, prominent part of my life goes undetected by the guy I\u2019ve worked closest with for years.\n\nI\u2019m happily married with two young kids, a fantastic job at a fortune 50 company, yet my anxiety owns most facets of my life.  I know I have it all, yet life is so overwhelming to me and everyday I long for my bed.  My throat is tight writing this, stomach tense, and heart skipping beats as I sit in my office.  I am finally going to take the step towards professional help.  Maybe someday I can leverage this to raise awareness for the silent destroyer that is anxiety disorder.  ",
