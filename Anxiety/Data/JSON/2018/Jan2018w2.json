I have to hire a sitter for my daughter, which means I have to post an ad and then actually *interview* people. In person. And then tell them if I want to pay them money to watch my kids. \n\nMy house is also just disgusting. Toys everywhere and laundry and dishes and just random shit. It's not like hoarders level and it's respectable enough but it needs a good deep cleaning. \n\nI have to work by myself for my first time ever tomorrow. Customer service. \n\nI have to figure out school loans, find a way to buy these ridiculously expensive textbooks, buy supplies for school, clean my car out, go grocery shopping, sell stuff on eBay and donate the rest of it, and try to get 8 hours of sleep because with my anxiety I've been managing about 4 and that's not cutting it anymore. \n\nI feel like I'm constantly about 30 seconds away from a panic attack. If I think about how much I need to do I can feel myself start to hyperventilate and my chest seizes up and my whole body feels tense and I start clenching my teeth. So the only way I can stop it is to lay down, get out my tablet and play candy crush. I actually did that for two straight hours last night after the kids went to bed without even realizing it. \n\nAnyway this is rambling and stuff I just needed to get it out. ",

I would spend hours each day refreshing my news feed, despite that I can name no more than ten people from my friends list who I even give a shit about. My news-feed is 99% toxic people who I went to school with, complaining and engaging in gossip. So Facebook went first.\n\nIt was a bit strange at first, worrying too. My brain had a reflex to check Facebook every time I was idle. But after a day it was like a constant buzzing in my head had been switched off. So Twitter quickly followed, then instagram, snapchat and all of my online dating apps. Gone. \n\nLife is challenging enough without having to worry about a virtual profile of yourself floating around in virtual space. Subconsciously knowing that 24/7 there are multiple online 'versions of you' spread across different platforms for anyone to judge. It's just been such a revelation to switch that off. From now on it's simply up to me in person to represent myself. \n\nMy anxiety is somewhat better, not even that much, but it's relevant to me and I can start to address these issues in my own time and space. I also understand it's kind of ironic posting this to Reddit, which some might consider a social network. But it doesn't have that same distinction in my own mind.\n\nI've seen alot of other folks on here and other subreddits talking about the positive effects of quitting social media, so thanks I guess.

I can\u2019t sleep because of a racing heart, wake up fine then slowly regress into headaches or a racing heart.\n\nMy headaches are basically scalp and neck tension which causes dizziness, then usually a standard pulsing headache. It causes the appearance of dizziness\nand head twitches and some\nbrain fog. I thought I had a neuro disorder (again, hypochondriac) but my docs ran a few tests and asked a ton of questions and chalked it up to anxiety (and it makes a lot of sense given the times it happens).\n\nAnyways, I recently discovered Chamomile tea after being a Black tea, then green tea addict.\n\nChamomile tea pretty much eases or destroys my brain fog and tension headaches. I\u2019m weird about taking medications now so advil isn\u2019t an option for me. But chamomile tea has helped tremendously and I believe it\u2019s caffeine free. It really mostly has immediate, short term effects, but feeling better for even an hour or two reminds me that there\u2019s a baseline \u201cnormal\u201d and the feeling is temporary and if it was serious it probably wouldn\u2019t have as easy a fix as a cup of tea.

After waiting for another hour a girl infront started to facetime her friend and then tried to point her camera at me without me noticing (I have severe eczema and a very noticeable rash on my face...) I made eye contact and shook my head... I felt angry then felt another panic attack heart beating out of my chest and instead of just saying fuck the appointment altogether I went outside took a deep breath and called my mom and told her I'd be late coming home. Then after another hour I finally saw the dentist fixed my cavities and almost had another panic attack because they were so close to my face but I told myself I'm not leaving and calmed down. \n\nSorry if this seems out of place but after dodging human contact for months before after one panic attack I felt this was a major win for me...",

I had gotten a job that was way too fast paced for me and I had a breakdown on the second day and quit. Since then I have had panic attacks every time I came close to employment. In the meantime I had been taking classes and volunteering in a few places, while my mother supported me. Well, last week one of the volunteer places told me they wanted me to apply for a job opening they would be posting.  It's an administrative job that I can zone out and do mostly alone. Perfect for me.  I applied, and today I got the call that I got the job! And I'm only halfway terrified! I feel like I have taken a huge step. It is quite possible that I'll feel very anxious in the coming days before I start work. I just wanted to share this victory. I've faced the biggest fear I've had since spiders. ",

There's a lot of things that give me the stress like class difficulty, the fact that now I'm not used to doing hw or school everyday since break was nearly 3 weeks long, the long days that make a week at college feel like an eternity. \n\nBasically I really would appreciate some advice or anyone's take on how to look at this differently. I have stress occasionally but my HIGH stress kicks in during school time and it gets bad I start getting in glum moods just no motivation sometimes panicky and it's no fun. Especially this night before the first day back, so anyone can relate then plz comment  ",
