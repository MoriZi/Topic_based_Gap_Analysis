However, it almost feels \"too good\" -- I can't wrap my head around why my own life is so pleasant when so many other humans have died of diseases, lived in slavery, suffered terrible discrimination, and so on.  Maybe as a reaction to that, when I am trying to fall asleep, I suddenly start envisioning all sorts of horrible things that could happen to me.  Here are the two biggest ones (which are not really compatible with one another).\n\n1. There might be a nuclear war with North Korea (both the US and North Korea have somewhat unstable despots, so it feels possible.)  In that case, maybe I shouldn't be spending thousands of dollars on a wedding photographer and florist, but instead spend that money trying to flee to Canada or something.\n2. I might end up having a severely disabled child who is violent and/or never learns to speak, who thus ruins my finances, my marriage, and my career.  Would I be able to give such a child up for adoption?  I panic about this too.  If I were pregnant, I think I'd panic even more (which might be bad for the baby).\n\nOf course, these fears are unlikely to come true, but they truly pervade my life.  (Maybe I subconsciously believe that if I worry enough, I can prevent these things from happening.)  Ironically, I spend very little time worrying about dying of hypoglycemia, even though that has nearly happened to me before and could easily happen again, since I take insulin for my type 1 diabetes.  But for some reason that doesn't weigh on me as much.\n\nDoes anyone have any tips for overcoming these fears?\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

Every single day I try to go but the anxiety is so overwhelming. I am so afraid that I'm going to have to speak in front of the class. In the last class I went to, someone answered a question and got it wrong and the whole class laughed at him. If that were to happen to me I don't know how I would cope. I would just die. Ever since that day I've been too scared to go to any classes. I'm so scared of being laughed at and mocked and judged. My roommate knows I have anxiety but I'm so good at hiding it from people that I don't think she would even believe me if I told her how bad I feel. I know I have group projects to do and I know I'm going to fail everything. I hate this illness so fucking much. I just want to go to class and get good grades but I'm paralysed by this illness. I dont know what to do. I'm completely lost. Someone please help me. I just want to be normal.",

Im not really sure why i cry, i have no answer in my head, i think it could be about my dad loosing his job but then its always after a fight or a discussion with my bf. He complains, i stay quiet, he asks whats wrong and i start to cry, has happened like two or three times in two weeks. We have always fought, constantly and about the same things, its either about my lack of affection or his \"excess\" of it, if that even makes sense. Lately it feels different. He tends to complain a whole lot of me so when the thing of my dad happened I asked him to try not to put so much emotional strain on me, i don't think he understood though, keeps complaining. \n\nYesterday for example i arrived at his place and was greeted by the sight of my boyfriend with his friend (who i think hates me) that shares \"history\" with him, i avoided meeting her for a long time but this time i had no alternative. I said hi and then we went up to his apartment and i just buried my face in his bed. I have a tendency of comparing myself with others, so i did that, my bf comforted me. Then he wanted a hug i gave it to him, then he asked me for a kiss, i gave it to him, then he asked for a BJ but i didn't felt like it and told him id do it later in the night and then he got all worked up and started complaining that i never do it and tell him later and then never do it, and that he has changed so much for me and he's not that intense anymore and that i'm still cold and don't show affection.\"i've given so much for you why. i started to cry (of course).\n\nanyway i want to die, but just sometimes. In my way home from my boyfriend i wished that something would happen to me. it didn't.\nIm motivated sometimes, i mostly stay at my house. I don't go out as much. I have issues trusting and letting people in. \n\nidk.\n am i depressed?",

            "selftext": " Hi all, \n\nI just thought I would share some of my feelings with you guys on issues I\u2019m going through right now. Please forgive me for such a long post (its intimidating to even look at, I know).   \n\nI really really need to be super clear in how I feel. I also think of myself as a manly guy (into boxing, weights and war literature) and am crippled by further embarrassment as expressing my feelings in the following way is a bit of a feminine thing to do.  As a prologue, I would say its pretty much safe to say that I live in my head.  \n\nI\u2019m in my early 30's married with a beautiful daughter. My problem right now lies with the world of work.  Right now I work for a very well known and respected international corporate company and have been for around 6 years in numerous fancy sounding roles. My pay in reality isn\u2019t fantastic but as a lot of things in life I project an image of social stability which many would crave. To highlight the level of corporation I work for I have been stopped several times by people in trains and coffee shops even wanting to know if I can get them a job in said company (as I had the company badge around my neck) \u2013 which highlights how well known it is. I\u2019m only telling you this to highlight that even though inside I feel shit and insecure I somehow managed to snag a role in a well respected company. \n\nI\u2019ve always hated working office roles and ultimately having a boss. That\u2019s it in a nutshell. Every job I\u2019ve ever had I\u2019ve seemed to run into trouble. I was let go (terminated) for a couple of temping type jobs in my younger days before I found some stability in these permanent roles I\u2019m in right now. My work history here has been up and down too. I\u2019ve had some technical support type roles under difficult management where my work wavered between considered subpar to truly excellent and worthy of awards at fancy corporate events. I\u2019ve just missed out on internal high-level promotions even though having been given outstanding feedback from interviewers because I simply didn\u2019t have some relative experience they were looking for which actually assisted my self-esteem quite a bit. Currently I\u2019m working in one of their solutions software teams and let\u2019s just say I\u2019ve ran into a bit more trouble as of late. I\u2019ve been sitting on queries and some of my work has been subpar which has lead to informal reviews and possible discussions with the HR team now for formal disciplinary action. The thought of this makes me feel a bit nauseous at how I\u2019ve got myself into this but its largely a fear of turning to help from superiors in case I appear to be incompetent. I deal with a lot of internal anxiety in my head if I\u2019m honest and overthinking sometimes plays a part in this. \n\nHere is an example of a moment of my working life:\n\nIf I want to ask a question about something before I send an email off or ask someone I will be thinking a million things in my head \u201cshould I send this, will I look incompetent in front of my peers for not knowing or I may have asked the question before and they are judging me more, maybe the accumulation of this thinking will make me look shit in my end of year review or will be held against me as someone who needs to be dismissed\u201d. My past will creep in when I\u2019ve gotten into trouble at work before for similar reasons. It\u2019s like a massive train wreck of anxiety. \n\nIn many ways its impacted my normal domestic life. I believe its played a part in turning me into an isolated and brooding figure outside of work (whereas at work I can project the image of someone who is charming, charismatic and funny). The dual figure can be quite bizarre. What makes things worse is that every single person around me seems to have their shit and life in gear. Married with children and in successful careers. I\u2019m left thinking \u2013 am I the only person out their who feels so shit out there in society?  \n\nI think after a year or so in a role some level of ennui creeps into me and I lack the drive in jobs. I\u2019ve been told off at times for asking the same question again to internal colleagues along with a few other issues. I\u2019ve lived with a certain anxiety now in terms of this and a fear of losing my role within the team. \n\nA strong part of me just wants to go out and do something else now instead of the role I\u2019m currently doing. I don\u2019t believe that I\u2019m cut out largely for these corporate type roles and that I\u2019m built for something else but I live with a certain anxiety which constantly follows me. What if I go into another field and the same issues follow me there? What if I make a leap into something else but I fail terribly? \n\nCan I do this with a wife and child in hand?\n\nThere are things which I love doing \u2013 I\u2019m a voracious reader of literature and naturally gregarious and sociable with people (when I want to be, I have this strange and frustrating habit of being able to switch it off when I want to much to the annoyance and chagrin of people at home) and enjoy writing when not dealing with severe mental blocks. I\u2019m also a good public speaker (part of public speaking organisations) and actually enjoy the feeling of being watched upon by the crowd and I have certifications in teaching by well respected bodies. I\u2019m pretty sure I have undiagnosed Pure OCD however which can be borderline crippling at times.  I\u2019ve never secured any therapy for this as once again I have felt subconsciously that it\u2019s a weakling thing to do. \n\nMoving onto a dream job seems like a fantasy, as I feel I will always be haunted by the notion of failure and not succeeding.  \n\nI just need some help guys.  I feel like a lost cause at times, but I keep it well hidden from others.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;",

That's my reality 24/7, literally being impatient, being anxious, being nervous, and getting more anxious, etc. just because i cant control it.\n\nA few months ago (3) I tried looking for help, went first to a psychiatrist, i didn't really enjoy the sessions, i felt judged, felt demeanored, so i stopped going and tried a psychologist instead. It went good the first session, i felt welcome she even made a test and i felt kind of relieved, even for a few minutes. after that i kept trying to get more appointments with her but she kept cancelling week after week, and i just gave up. The following two months were not that bad, i mean, i felt nervous most of the time, but i could control it.\n\nHowever the last few weeks have been hell for me, I've felt insecure, having negative thoughts in my head 24/7, overthinking everything in a negative way, i have tried meditation but it doesn't really help, i have tried literally unplugging myself from the rest of the world, I've literally looked for YouTube videos on how to deal with anxiety but no luck. It has brought me troubles in my relationship just because most of the times that anxiety and insecurities take control over me and i don't know what to do. It became a vicious cycle i just couldn't control. I came to a point where i would fight mi GF for no reason, and then just apologize, i really put to much stress into her hands (and she's got enough already), those actions made me feel even more insecure, and because of that the relationship has felt more distant, and distance has been increasing in the last few weeks, all cuz of me, i really want someone to talk to, i don't want a quick fix, i really need is help, for me, for my relationship, i really want to be better, is just that i don't know where to start cuz i feel that everything i do is just pointless, like i just doesn't work. i feel like i cannot control myself anymore, like imma loose that woman cuz of my insecurity and lack of patience, like i have said, it's a cycle, one that i want to get out from. i've even arrived to a point to which i over analyze every single text of hers and just think the worst of it... \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nthanks in advance ...",

            "selftext": "I classified my anxiety as an addiction. An addiction to overthinking, an addiction to avoiding pain, and an addiction to having control.\n\nIt showed itself by thoughts about clinging to the past, by trying to rewrite the past to change my perspective on mistakes I have made. To get rid of the guilt from those mistakes.\nIt showed itself through thoughts about the future, not always far into the future, sometimes only minutes or even seconds. Thoughts trying to plan out what will happen, sometimes even multiple possibilites to what could happen with each having an answer as to what I should do in each possible future. Again sometimes far into the future, sometimes as close as the very next moment in time.\n\nEven when I supposedly was in the present meditating, it was with a goal in mind. To feel better than yesterday, tomorrow.\n\nI wanted control. And I thought I could think my way into absolute control of my mood, my past, my future, my relationships, my career.\n\nTrying to life this way is about as simple as this challenge:\nDon't think about the color red.\nDid you think about the color red? Yeah, me too.\n\nThe mind works mostly on reflexes.  You give it something to react to and it will. Which in and of itself is not bad, we need it to do that to survive. The issue arises when we abuse that. I abused my own mind, and it became an addiction. \n\nWhen the mind reacts to the mind reacting to the mind reacting to the mind reacting to the mind reacting to the mind, it's not all that surprising that you start to feel a bit dizzy!\n\nYou get caught up in an illusion.\n\nThe illusion is that the past and the future exist. The past is your thoughts in this moment of what has happened in this moment. The future is your thoughts creating ideas of what this moment could become. But both the past and future are only thoughts in the present.\nHow does having those thoughts all the time affect you? Try thinking from 1 and up (1,2,3,4 etc) while at the same time visualizing the numbers as you count with your thoughts. So think the number 1 and visualise the letter 1. And so on for all the numbers in the correct order. 1,2,3,4 etc. And try and do a simple task while doing it. It feels very straining, might even give you a bit of a headache. And that is a simple way of occupying your mind which doesn't create any emotional reaction. Imagine what you're doing to your minds wellbeing by thinking of your ideas of the past or the future all the time while doing complex tasks at work while dealing with your relations to your colleagues. How straining it is day in and day out.\n\nHow I overcame anxiety is by understanding that \"the past\" doesn't exist, only my thoughts about it. \"The future\" doesn't exist only my thoughts creating ideas about it. And by realizing my thoughts are just my mind reacting to what I feed it.\nI meditated to let go of my attachment to \"the past\", to \"the future\", and to the belief that my thoughts were reality. Thoughts are not reality, believing so is an illusion and it's not a fun one to live your life in, believe me I know!\n\nThis takes practice. How long depends a lot on your specific journey. But overcoming anxiety is very possible.\n\nIt is not something you can discover externally, it is an internal journey but you can find signs pointing you in the right direction.\n\nHave any questions? Ask away!\nAnd remember to take care of yourself, you're the only you there is.",

I'm absolutely terrified of the possibility of having an illness and being so anxious about it every single day is exhausting. The second I feel any kind of pain or unusual feeling I convince myself that I have some kind of incurable sickness and am going to die. Why do I think and feel this way!? Don't get me wrong - I understand thats its normal and encouraged to get unusual feelings/symptoms checked but why do I always have to take it to the extreme? I have a very open relationship with my doctor regarding my health anxiety - he's awesome and always takes the time to understand my concerns which I deeply appreciate but at the end of the day it doesn't solve the root of the issue. I have no idea what its like to go through life without constantly worrying about my health. I go through spans of time where I get so anxious about it that I can't sleep which in turn makes me feel like shit which in turn makes me think I'm sick which in turn makes me even more anxious and then that causes a panic attack etc. I never know if I'm actually having symptoms like exhaustion related to an illness or if its just a reaction to my anxiety that causes these 'symptoms'. How nuts is that!\n\nIf anyone has been in or is in the same situation as this I'd love to hear about your experiences and how you deal with your health anxiety. I have ways that help me cope but sometimes its just too much, you know?",

            "selftext": "A Surgery is coming up for me and I've been terrified to go through with it even though I really need it. \n\nI need a surgery on my left knee to fix a big, inflamed tear in my meniscus. In my 15 years I've been alive, I've had around 4-5 surgeries. ( I may have had one when I was little for tubes in my ears, I just can't remember. ) I don't know why this surgery gives me so much anxiety. I'm just terrified that something will go wrong and I won't be able to walk again. It probably sound far fetched but I'm so scared I haven't been able to sleep right since I've gotten the news. (Which was only a few days ago.)  Me and my mother are going tomorrow to the doctors to get a knee stabilizer. I'm just so fucking scared and so filled with anxiety I don't know what to do and I needed to tell someone. Thanks for reading. I appreciate it.",
