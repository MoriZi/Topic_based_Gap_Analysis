            "selftext": "Remembering recent behaviour when I was doing good, it seems there were times when I still felt the same anxiety that was stopping me before, but did things anyways. I was somehow stronger and the anxiety was at most a mild annoyance.\n\nSome people simply say the solution to anxiety is to go through it and do things anyways. This made me feel bad and guilty for not doing things. But there was really some other issue there, a lack of the strength needed to push through the anxiety. I also feel a kind of anger about people saying that and apparently judging me for not doing things which I simply couldn't do.\n\nThe worst anxiety experience is struggling to do something when I don't have the strength to do it, and experiencing prolonged anxiety because of that. I'm pretty sure it's better to not even try or to give up quickly than to persevere at this, because if I'm not strong enough to do it I'll just spend time in a painful state and make myself feel worse. I think if unsuccessful, such prolonged experiences also reinforce anxiety and bad habits.\n\nBut, where does this strength to push through anxiety come from?  I only have glimpses of understanding, and it's late, so I'm not going to try to put them down here now. Maybe I'll respond in a comment tomorrow.",

And hey, it's a foot in the door, so it could potentially lead to some higher paying roles in the future. \n\nI have to call the guy back later as he called right as my supervisor walked in so I couldn't talk.

            "selftext": "For the last few years I have been crippled with anxiety. My whole life, actually. But it's gotten so much worse over the last few years.\n\nI've lost jobs. I've lost friends and relationships directly or indirectly related to my anxiety. I self medicated with drugs, got addicted and spent 2 years in active recovery. \n\nI used to say that waking up in the morning was like being shot out of a cannon. Immediate, crippling anxiety was overwhelming and shaped everything I did. It's been hard. So, so hard. \n\nLooking at others who seemingly had no problem breezing through life was difficult.\n\nI know it's hard to live like this. I know how hard you struggle just to get through the day, and back to bed. I know how difficult it is to be constantly plagued with the cringe... That relentless reminder of all the situations tainted with awkwardness. I understand it because it is my life. \n\nA year ago I decided to really try hard with everything I've got, with all my best effort. To push through, even when I have convinced myself I already ruined everything. To feel the cringe, and to try with all my might to tell myself it doesn't have to be this way. It was incredibly difficult.. beyond words, it was insurmountable. I didn't think I could ever overcome any of it. \n\nFor all of you that understand this, I want to say that you are not alone. For those that struggle, I have much love for you. It's a silent battle.. and everything is tragic. It feels impossible to be anything different and I know that, and I'm sorry. This is your cross to bear.. and it's so heavy, and I have incredible empathy for your situation. \n\nIt's still difficult, please don't get me wrong. But somehow, over this time, I've come to terms with it. With myself. I actively try hard not to compare myself to others, because I know I'll lose every time that way. When a cringe memory comes into my head, I remind myself that it's just a memory. It doesn't have to be my future. \n\nSomeone once said that those who are depressed are living in the past. And those that are anxious are living in the future. I remind myself this daily. It helps. Not immediately, but over time, it does help.\n\nAnd I just want to say that last week I got my dream job. Quite literally, what once was impossible happened. What I once knew to be an absolute impossibility happened. \n\nI'm so grateful to all of you. Your words here have helped more than any therapist or support group. You've all helped me so much, and I just want to thank you. \n\nFrom the bottom of my heart, thank you. Much love to you all. You are not alone, and it is possible. ",

I almost cried of happiness.\n\nI went to a photography school, had a nice chat with the teacher and one of the models, and I paid for my first classes - even got an extra one as a gift.\n\nOverall, it was a fantastic day, and not a single hint of anxiety or depression.

Almost every course I do is essentially a \"dumbed down\" version because I'm incapable of doing any of them at a normal level. If I was told the math I was doing right now was at a grade 6th level, I'd believe it. \n\nI used to have hobbies, but I've since given up at them after realizing there was no point to me trying anymore. At a young age, I would read obsessively, but I honestly haven't picked up a book since I was 12 years old now because of how low my reading comprehension is. \n\nToday, I was attempting to cook for myself for the first time, but I should've known better. I ended up crying like a baby after being unable to understand the recipe and chop vegetables correctly. Yeah, cutting vegetables. One of the easiest tasks ever, right? Well, not when you're as stupid as me.\n\nThere is honestly no reason for someone like me to continue living because I am of no use to society. I already know I'm not going to make it to college so whatever job I get in the future is likely going to be one I'm bound to for the rest of my life, assuming I don't get fired due to being a moron.\n\nI'm unable to enjoy anything because of how bad I'll be at it. Whenever I try to educate myself on something I end up sobbing because I can't understand it. \n\nDon't suggest therapy. Don't. Every single time I make a post here that's all people will mention. I'm medicated, I have multiple counselors, but unless they're somehow able to make me less of a waste to society, I'm not going to be happy. They know my problems. They can't help me though. Some people are just complete idiots, and I'm one of them.",

I have ocd and general anxiety, so last semester when I had a bad OCD spike I decided to go to therapy because my college provides it for free, and it has honestly changed my life.\n\nI can hang out with my friends without feeling extremely anxious about whether I have cancer or they hate me, I decided to study abroad, and I even got a good summer internship.\n\nI feel like I\u2019ve turned a corner, and last night I went to do karaoke which in many ways was the culmination of the process I\u2019ve been undergoing for the past year. I swear that I\u2019m not as weird as I sound here lol, but I honestly could never have seen myself doing this. It\u2019s super small, but it\u2019s the result of a big change.",
