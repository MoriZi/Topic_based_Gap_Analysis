For some years now, I've just had something like a lump in my throat that I can not get out of, it's as if it were somehow the manifestation of my hatred, I'm always in a constant mental flutter, I always remember distant or recent things, such Sometimes they do not matter but somehow they cause me a feeling of aversion and hatred that I can not control. Somehow, I'm never really calm, I always have that aversion inside me, there are times when someone in my family or a friend can tell me something and that only causes me anger, it's like I'm already with the feeling and then I just want to explode. Obviously I try to control myself and sometimes I feel stupid, because the causes that feed this vibe are simply ridiculous, the fact of realizing that and not being able to escape makes me feel suffocated at times. I have never told anyone about this, I do not want anyone to worry unnecessarily about me, in the country where I live and in the economic situation for which I am living the medical treatment really is not an option.

            "selftext": "I recently had a physical and found out I was deficient in Vitamin D. This came as a surprise because I spend quite a bit of time outside.\n\nThat got me thinking about other vitamins I might be deficient in and I ended up finding out  many people are deficient in magnesium which has been shown to greatly affect anxiety for some.\n\nSo I started taking vitamin D prescribed by my doctor which seemed to help some. I then asked about magnesium and my doc agreed it helps many so I added that.\n\nIt's been a month and I feel a thousand times better. No more random rushes of anxiety.\n\nSo to anyone who hasn't had a physical recently, I'd definitely recommend doing so and asking their doctor about these vitamins specifically. It could really help you! ",

This kind of scenario is an absolute killer for me and is not something that I would usually have any chance of succeeding with (or even completing)\n\nI took 30mg of propranol an hour before the event, and another 30mg 10 minutes before the event. (Total of 60)\n\nI was horrified all throughout the lead up, but when I finally came to speak - my voice worked.  It worked, it was smooth, i had plenty of breath, i could get my words out.  I've never experienced so much ease with talking in this kind of situation before, usually it is such a fight against my body in order to get my words out, but this was absolutely unbelievable, the tight grip around me was free.\n\nToday was a good day.",

            "selftext": "Hey, guys! First-time poster here! I'm a 22 year old female who's just been feeling really \"off\" these past few days. I've been unable to sleep in my room. It feels really hot in there, and then of course, I start panicking and have trouble taking deep breaths. I'm just scared for some reason. I just feel like I have a knot in my chest that won't go away. In addition, my left arm aches and my left foot just randomly feels tingly and cold. Of course, I start overthinking and worrying that I have something majorly wrong with me. I called my mom (she's a doctor), and she thinks I'm just showing symptoms of hypochondria, telling me not to worry and that we have anxiety-prone people in our family (namely, my aunt). \n\nI should also note that I've been in the habit of drinking an iced coffee at least once a day, which I've been trying to stop since it's been affecting me worse than usual lately. I had my first panic attack after drinking coffee two years ago, which was a very frightening experience. Since then, I've had one more serious attack this past spring. Now, I just feel jittery and have trouble sleeping. Anyway, I'm sorry this is all over the place. I just needed somewhere to let this out. I'll be applying to medical school next summer, and I can't wait to just be able to have the proper level of medical education to discern whether symptoms are concerning or not. Haha!\n\nTL;DR: 22 year old female with a history of caffeine-induced panic attacks suddenly developing hypochondriac tendencies in the past few days. Just feeling off and don't know why. Want to be normal again.",

I look at those people who have great grades, friends and a social life. They are always jolly and laughing. Obviously they may have their own problems, but that actually makes me feel worse. I really love my major and like to be proactive in class and stay up to date on coursework. But recently my anxiety (which I had kept manageable for over a year) has kicked in very bad. I look at these people and I panic. It hurts a lot. I no longer feel like doing my coursework and that is gonna further screw everything up. Worst thing is that somewhere in the back of my mind, I know that I am as good as, if not better than the people who cause me these panic attacks. But just seeing them scares me. \n\nI wonder if this is strange or others with anxiety have experienced something of the sort?",

            "selftext": "Hi.. so my constant fear of the next day, fear of changing my fate from one little decision (the butterfly effect) has kept me stagnant in life for more than 10 years. \n\nSo when I was 5 years old, my parents took me to a furniture store and let me choose any bed I wanted. I couldn't choose between a canopy bed with a white veil and a 2 story bed with a pink slide, but ended up choosing the bed with the slide. When I got home, I realized I wanted the canopy bed and regretted my decision.\n\nWhen I was in the 2nd grade, my mom asked me if she should get a divorce. I knew my parents' relationship was really bad, and their fights were pretty severe, and I remember those 30 seconds of weighing the pros and cons of each choice felt like 5 years. If they got a divorce, I knew I had to go back to my home country with my mom, and I wanted to stay in Canada where we moved, and I thought that as long as I was a good daughter, their relationship would improve. But I remember my gut feeling saying, 'their relationship is REALLY BAD. They should separate.\" but I wanted to stay in Canada and I also didn't want my dad to be alone so I said NO,  stay together. The next few years was absolute hell for me emotionally and I still live with the trauma as an adult. \n\nI also pulled out my wisdom teeth and did some extraction orthodontics that has changed my face for the worse, because I didn't know about orthopedics and John Mew/Mike Mew. Ever since taking out my wisdom teeth, I've suffered from really strange illnesses like bloating and insomnia and TMJ for more than a year.\n\nFrom these episodes, I decided that I should not be trusted with making decisions and avoided making decisions for most of my life. When I went to university, I gave my boyfriends or friends the responsibility of making my decisions for me because I felt that I would only make decisions that will screw me for life like the one I made in second grade. \n\nHowever, I recently started realizing that my (now ex) boyfriend was making decisions for me that didn't give me the best outcomes- it gave him the best outcomes or he just didn't care how that decision affected me.\n\nI broke up with him, and now, as a 24 year old, I am even unsure of what I want for lunch and where to sit on the bus. \n\nI fear that even deciding where to sit on the bus will cause a butterfly effect that will screw me in the future in some way.\n\nI fear that if I distract myself from anxiety and fear with pleasurable activities (books, movies) or focusing on my responsibilities (school, work), life will hand me a tragic event kind of like \"ha-ha, you thought you could have a great life, but you were wrong.\" \n\nMy mom recently got remarried to a wonderful guy who is so great to me and my brother, and even then I was fearful that this \"seemingly good event\" could be one of those things where you THINK  this will be really good for you but it turns out it's actually sending you to your doom. Just like the wisdom teeth removal. All of my friends told me that extracting wisdom teeth will make your jaw slimmer and therefore you'll get prettier. But my face turned out worse. \n\nAfter my mom got remarried so many wonderful things happened to me and my family but it drove me to more anxiety that something bad will happen to even things out. \n\nI had a very rocky relationship with my mom and I'm also trying to mend things with her and be a better daughter, but I started fearing that because I've been so mean to her all these years, karma will teach me a lesson by taking this chance away from me right when I'm ready to make amends with her. So ever since I decided to repair our relationship, I've been suffering from intrusive thoughts that justify that I just won't get the chance to have a great relationship with her again because I don't deserve it. \n\nAnd the most torturous part of these thoughts is that a part of me thinks that I could 'manifest' my own demise by fearing and thinking about it all the time. I get 'visions' of how tragedy will strike me and I am so scared that I am 'manifesting' it. \n\nAnother example is in the first grade, a new student came to our class and sat in front of me. I had this 'vision' that he would stab my hand with a pencil. To test this out, I put out my hand, palm facing up on the desk. And he really did stab me with his pencil. \n\nThis is why I'm so afraid that these intrusive thoughts about me predicting my own demise and visions of how it will happen are going to be true and I'm manifesting them.\n\nHowever, sometimes I do realize that it is paranoia, because last year, I was completely convinced that I had contracted hiv because I did something that I wasn't supposed to be doing, and karma would strike to teach me a lesson. I started becoming convinced that I contracted it because I was eating dinner and overheard the news covering a story about an hiv outbreak in the area and I took that as a 'sign'. I started showing EVERY SINGLE SYMPTOM I saw online, and I took the test multiple times which turned out negative. Even then, I didn't believe it and was convinced that I was one of those people out of a million that show negative test results that turn out to be positive in a year. At this time, I was trying to regain my health and turn my life around after being heavily medicated and drinking my days away. I was convinced that life would say, 'ha-ha, you thought you deserved a chance at a great life, but just when you thought you could redeem yourself and reach your goals and dreams, I'll give you this tragic event that will prevent you from gaining what you want in life.\" \n\nI even broke up with my ex boyfriend because I was convinced that if I didn't learn to be independent, something horrible would happen to me that will force me to become independent. This caused both of us a lot of pain, and caused me to spiral into a state worse than I could have ever imagined. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI try to engage in meditation and try to 'let things go' and things will 'solve itself', but I feel that 'letting things go' will turn out to be a cruel hoax and right when I'm comfortable, at peace, and satisfied, life will punish me in some way. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhat are the principles I need to live life by? \n\nWhy do I think this way? \n\nDo you think I will manifest my worst fears because I obsess over them? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI am so exhausted living this way. I've seriously considered suicide many times because I'm so fearful of life giving me a horrible circumstance I cannot control. People say I should learn to be okay with uncertainty, I should learn from my mistakes and try to make decisions for myself. \n\nI'm so afraid to just live. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

            "selftext": "I'm not going to go into the full detail and history behind this problem as that would take a long time and it is very complex. Currently, I live in a house that is a stable environment, though it wasn't always, but every time I come home I get an anxiety attack. I will get anxiety in the morning, and when I come home I will get an anxiety attack. Meal time is absolute hell, as I am falling apart while trying to make accommodations for others and answer their questions while suffocating and eating voraciously to cope with the stress. Often, I want to even come home early because I get tired of spending all day outside of the home, but that initial excitement fades away by the time I am halfway home. At this point, I get this awful feeling in my stomach, like it's about to implode. This terrible, unnerving feeling grows and once I near home, it turns into anxiety. By the time I enter the driveway, I am extremely anxious. At this point it is a battle to maintain stability and not fall apart between the time I arrive home, and however long it takes until the house is quiet and everyone is asleep. Today, I came home earlier than normal because it is halloween and I wanted to. Suffice to say, it has been no more than 3 hours since I came, and I am barely stable. This happens, almost everyday, though I usually come really late, which makes it much easier to deal with. Again, there is much much more to why I am feeling this way, and why I get so anxious, but it would take pages of explanation since there are so many details. Does anyone else experience something like this. It doesn't have to be your home, it could be a workplace you go to or a school. Just some place involving other people, who aren't necessarily bad, but that are very triggering.",
