Most of the time I just feel relief if I didn't mess up too bad, much like music performances. Also I am doing a pretty rigorous educational program and I feel that my frequent anxious/negative thoughts and my subsequent coping mechansms are leaving little brain power left for me to learn.

            "selftext": "My wife passed out from a panic attack yesterday in the theatre while we were watching *A Quiet Place*. I was so scared and didn't know what to do. About an hour into the movie, there's a scene where someone steps on a nail. It wasn't even very gory, but I guess it triggered some bad memories for her.\n\n\nA few seconds after that scene, my wife's arm started twitching kind of like a seizure. At the same time, she started making sounds like she was snoring or maybe choking. When I looked at her, her head was lolled to the side and her eyes were closed. Not realizing what was happening, I nudged her a bit, thinking she had fallen asleep. When her head rolled to the other side and there wasn't any other response my concern sky-rocketed. I took her head in my hands and gently shook her a little bit trying to wake her up. Her eyes partially opened, and I could see her pupils were looking up like when you roll your eyes. There was no other response. I tilted her head forward and the \"snoring\" sound stopped, but she was still unconscious.\n\n\nAt this point, about half a minute or so had passed with her in this state and I thought I had a real medical emergency on my hands. There were only two other people in the theatre with us, and they were a couple rows ahead of us. They glanced back when I started to loudly say, *\"Are you okay?! Honey, are you all right?\"* I was about to call 911. With her head in my hands, I placed my mouth against her ear and yelled, *\"Can you hear me?! Honey!?!\"*\n\n\nSuddenly, there was signs cognition. Her eyes opened, and she started breathing very quickly. I'd estimate she was out for about a minute. She glanced around like she was trying to figure out where she was at, and finally seemed to see and recognize me. In between gasps for breath she managed to say, *\"I'm having a panic attack.\"* Up to that point I didn't know what was going on. I was so scared. \n\n\n*\"Come on, let's go.\"* I said. I put my arm under hers and held her tightly as we descended the stairs. She wasn't steady on her feet, and was leaning on me quite a bit. When we finally got out of the theatre she collapsed down on the floor against the wall and kind of rocked a little bit back and forth. *\"I... can't... take... visceral horror.\"* she said. I just held her; trying to comfort her.\n\n\nAfter a couple minutes she said she felt well enough to walk, so we walked back to our car. She said she didn't need to go to the hospital. We only live about 5 minutes from the theatre. After we made it home, she said she just needed me to hold her and help her feel safe. I tried to just hold her and comfort her. After about a half hour she was doing better.\n\n\nI felt so helpless when she was unconscious. It's very scary when you suddenly realize your loved one is having a medical emergency. Later in the evening, she revealed to me that when she was a teenager, she had an abusive boyfriend that would rape her, cut her with a scalpel, and poke her with needles. Sick stuff like that I guess. She wouldn't say much more about it than that.\n\n\nI am angry. Not at her, but at the thought some sicko did this to her. And I hurt. I grieve that she has experienced something so traumatic it causes this type of thing. She agreed we will get her into some therapy. She needs healing that I never knew she needed. I also know this isn't about me, but I feel a bit hurt this is just now coming out. We've been married about 5 years, and I never knew this stuff. What else don't I know?\n\n\nI don't know what type of advice I'm looking for. How can I be there for her? How can I help? What do I do if this happens again? Did I do the right thing both during and after?\n",

Today I finally got the courage to actually apply for a job, after a lot of convincing myself I am not totally useless. I immediately received a phone call from the agency saying they think with my qualifications I would be quite suited to the role and have now spent the last hour crying because I am so terrified I might actually get a job interview.\n\nAnyone else find that looking for jobs is the worst for anxiety? So much self doubt, fear of not being good enough, fear of actually being good enough to get the job, fear of having to be judged in an interview, having to meeting new people. I just feel so awful right now and would like to hear about other people's experiences and if anyone has found some way of overcoming it",

            "selftext": "I first called my future boss today, (anxiety for calling him). We decided we was gonna drive to the office in the city and talk (the city is 20min away), so I asked my grandma to drive me there. That\u2019s anxiety number 2, being seen with my grandma. I then decided I was gonna go to a store in the city and buy some stuff. This is anxiety trigger number 3. Go where it\u2019s a lot of ppl.\n\nWe went to the office first. He said I can start next week! I even meet my little brothers friends big brother there, cause he was buying something there. The boss even showed me the workspace and his partners and I said hi and talked like I don\u2019t have anxiety / social anxiety at all. I didn\u2019t think \u201comg what do they think of me etc\u201d Nothing like that happened!\n\nThen we went to the store to buy cloths and some stuff, I went there I talked like normal, I answered hi when the ppl that work there said hi. I looked at them even! Then we couldn\u2019t find my cloths really, so we asked a guy that work there. He said follow me and I went away from my grandma cause she went the other way! So now I\u2019m alone with a stranger! I talked to him like normal, I got what I wanted then I said \u201cthank you!\u201d Then I calmly walked back to my grandma! Then I was gonna try my new bank card. I never used that in a store before and I had huge anxiety that it won\u2019t work when a lot of ppl watching me. So we go to the thingy where u pay, I lay everything up and it didn\u2019t work the first time cause I didn\u2019t push the card all the way in. I even said \u201chm it doesn\u2019t work\u201d then he said what to do. I did it and I payed then I stood STILL LIKE SO CALMLY AND UN ANXIOUS while I was looking at my grandma paying when it was like 10 other ppl in the line.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t a lot of ppl in that store it was no sounds really cause it was only a few ppl there, so maybe I woulda got a lot more anxious if it was more sound/ more ppl but WOW I JUST DID THIS! DIJGKWOFJSKFKDJFJD IM SO PROUD OF MYSELF!\n\nLike how ON EARTH did I not feel any anxiety, when normally my anxiety/ social anxiety is god awful! Is it cause it\u2019s summer or what?!\n\nI JUST HAD TO SHARE THIS TO SOMEONE!!! HAPPY BOY. (I\u2019m 20) so a lot of ppl probably expect me to do this without my grandma there in the first place but, I did it!! I didn\u2019t even feel the need to be with my grandma there, like I felt quite confident even if she wouldn\u2019t be there.\n\nI did it!",

            "selftext": "\nI traveled for a few hours so I could see a show I\u2019d been excited to see for months. It wasn\u2019t good. \n\nI get panic attacks at a lot of shows, but I go anyway because I love them. And when it\u2019s good, I get lost in the experience and it\u2019s kind of therapeutic. I fucking love the aggressive ones where I can get my bad feelings out without genuinely hurting people.\n\nAnyway: I had a feeling this one would give me\na panic attack, which is shitty but okay. I have them a lot, I\u2019m good at riding them out. But this was the worst one I\u2019ve had in a long time.\n\nWhat began the spiral was the crowd. The people around me were fucking annoying. Normally the annoying people dissipate over time, but these ones were resilient. I  won\u2019t get into what they were doing, but I don\u2019t think it was a malicious thing. They were just self absorbed drunk people. I didn\u2019t move because I wanted to see the show and also have an attitude of \u201cfuck that I\u2019m not letting these shit-eaters stop me\u201d, but I couldn\u2019t focus on what was actually happening so HEY I guess they did.\n \nThen my personal issues started revving up, because that\u2019s how anxiety goes for me. See how everyone here is thinner? See how they have friends? See how much less crazy they look? I felt like a disgusting alien.\n\nIt moved from feeling bad to feeling that panic attack terror when the headliner was playing, because her whole album is about abuse/rape. And the girls around me kept yelling at her about how hot she is mixed with empty shit like RAPE SUCKS. And I get that it\u2019s not a huge\ndeal, but in the moment it was fucking terrifying to me, because I was having a lot bad stuff come up and I felt completely alone. Like I\u2019d read this entire album I loved wrong, nobody got it, and I once again felt like a disgusting alien. Except now it was tied to that feeling of being rotted from the inside, my skin was crawling,\nand I couldn\u2019t breathe. I am filth to the core of my fucking soul and I will die alone in a cesspool shit.\n\nI started having a panic attack, but I was able to stave it off until the end (sometimes I can push them off a bit when I recognize it early). Then I drank some water, went outside, and burst into tears on the sidewalk.\n\nIt\u2019s also worth noting that I was wearing a black sweatshirt that said I HAVE GIVEN UP, was drenched in sweat, and it had rained out so everything was wet. Total fucking mess.\n\nAnd that\u2019s where I stayed for two goddamn hours. I changed spots a couple times, but I was mostly frozen in terror trying to convince myself that I was allowed to move. Of the 40+ people who walked by, only one asked if I was okay, even though I was blatantly losing my shit. \n\nI kind of don\u2019t blame them because I realize there is danger in talking to people who look crazy, but at the same time I do. Because I ask people if they\u2019re okay all the time. Especially at shows where people are on drugs.\n\nI haven\u2019t really slept, I cut up my arm, and I feel like vomiting. I\u2019ll get over it, but I needed to vent. I feel humiliated, stupid, and alone.\n\n",

I was away from home, from my family and my anxiety was really bad (I have ocd) and she was the first person that believe in me and understood what was going on in my brain and made feel like I wasn't crazy. 3 years passed and I'm so much better, I'm a totally diferent person. In my last consult we both started crying because next consult it will be my last.\nSo I want to make something special, a little something to say thank you. Nothing can pay what she did to me but I want to give her something that she could keep and remember me because I will never forget her.\n\nSorry for the long post\n\nI need ideas people ;) ",

Id been wanting to hang out one on one but just couldn't, everytime I'd try to message her and ask I'd just shutdown and be unable. Through some miracle I managed to ask her to see Deadpool and she was keen. So last night we met up (she said I looked good which was nice) and got some food (which I could hardly eat I was so nervous) then saw the film. Throughout the entire film she was just learning on me, occasionally resting her head on my shoulder. Overall just being kinda cutesy. I was honestly quite stressed throughout the night but kind of hid it; she did comment after that I was shaking and my eye was twitching so apparently not well. But overall aside from the stress I actually had fun last night. We've already made plans to do it again sometime and I'm actually looking forward. As someone who's usually super nervous about situations like this I'm honestly proud of myself for going through with it.",

Traveling (especially flying) is a nightmare for me, and I can only really manage my anxiety on trips when I'm with my parents. Otherwise, the trip is however many days of nausea, panic, and the whole lot.\n\nBut tomorrow, I'm doing something that I've always been too afraid to do. I'm taking a 3 hour road trip by myself. I know that sounds silly. I only got my license about 3 years ago when I was 16, right on time, but I was slow to take up driving. I love driving in familiar areas close to home, but hate driving distances. It's all because of my anxiety. What if I get sick? What if I pass out? What if I crash? What if I panic and get home?\n\nWell, I don't care. And I know I can do it. I can handle it. I've changed so much just within a year and I don't want to be afraid anymore, so I'm doing this. I'll be visiting my boyfriend (we go to college together but he normally lives 3 hours away) so it's worth it. I tried doing this twice last summer and chickened out. But this time is different. \n\nHoping for the best!!! The weather isn't looking the best (cloudy/rainy) and I'd much prefer sun but can't do anything to change that. \n\nAny road trip tip would be much appreciated :) I'm leaving tomorrow morning!",
