So I\u2019m walking past her, my mind is racing, I\u2019m thinking, should I? Only if she looks up and makes eye contact. And remember, this is all in like two seconds. And it\u2019s moderately crowded with people walking back and forth. So she looks up, we make eye contact, we smile at each other and I tell her I like her dress, still smiling she thanked me... and that was that.\nOne of my big things is social cues and mispronouncing words so this was a really big deal to me. And it feels good to receive compliments right? so yeah... It was a massive endorphin rush and confidence booster.",

I have a trapped nerve in my neck that has flared up something wicked, but I have come to expect these things, just about to bed down for the night guys I hope anyone reading this that thinks they can not do something realises that anything is possible! If I can do it anyone can just don\u2019t give up always chip away making as many positive gains as possible and you may well be very surprised at the outcome, it is never easy, battling with yourself every day is one of the hardest things we with anxiety and depression can go through but always remember there are definitely better days ahead, stay strong and god bless to all who suffer with this very real illness, much love.

I have a stable, decent job; I have a family that loves me, I have some good friends (even if none of them still live in the same state as me), I'm about to be able to afford my own place. But I can't see the pure good in that because my rose colored glasses are fringed with the pure black of mental illness. The last few weeks have actually been really good; I've been getting out more and reaching out trying to make more friends locally. But a flashback, plus a depressive episode and now a panic attack all within a few days makes everything good seem so far away. I hate that this happens. I hate that I have to rely on mind altering substances just so I can maintain the mask of a well-adjusted person. Worst of all I hate that I feel like I have no one me near me that would truly understand if I opened up about any of this. And I'm also tired of being quiet about it, and I needed to vent.",

At the end of the day he settled on \"anxiety disorder unspecified\" for insurance reasons and said that he does think my issues stem from anxiety and that they are a potential cause for my irritability and anger. \nI feel really great about it all.

As in, an embarrassing memory would pop into my head and I'd have to scream/shout/say a random phrase, completely involuntarily, so that it goes away. I recently got an Amazon Echo and I guess I got so used to talking to it, that for about the past week the phrase \"Alexa please\" has been my vocal tic. Of course, my Echo would hear it and respond \"That's so nice, just ask me what you'd like me to do\". Since these verbal tics happen like a dozen times a day or more, I got really annoyed at hearing it from Alexa. So now I have this pavlovian reaction where my mind knows that if I have a verbal tic, my Echo would hear it and respond, which has resulted in these tics being quieter and less frequent than it's ever been.

I experienced the weirdest and most horrible symptoms including convulsions, nausea, butterflies in stomach, thoughts of death, ectopic heart beats, rolling panic attacks lasting hours/days, itchy skin, pain during urination, sever depression, feeling like i can\u2019t breathe, feeling like i am going to die, insomnia, depersonalisation, derealisation, pains in chest, neck, head, weakness in legs, crazy head pressure where the only way i could sleep was on my stomach because i couldn\u2019t relax my head on my pillow, and face rash, among others. \n\nIt slowly started getting better last year and then one day it got way worse, and kept getting worse. So then i went to a doctor and got a full checkup because i thought i was dying (anxiety). Everything came back normal (except the ectopic heart beats (but they are not dangerous) so then i asked for a referral to see a psych (after she offered me drugs and i said no). \n\nStarted seeing my psych over the course of the last 3 months and over that time i slowly got better until today i realised i have been anxiety free for the last 6 weeks. I also read this book which helped a lot, it\u2019s called rewiring your anxious brain. These two things along with changing jobs from one i hated to one i love has in my opinion cured my anxiety. \n\nI am turning 27 this year and the last 1.5 years of my life were the absolute worst years of my life. I am finally loving life again and am so happy that the panic attacks have disappeared and that i am not constantly thinking i am dying. Hope this helps anyone who is in a similar situation that i was. ",

It does not really matter what I do since you will probably stay with me at least for the rest of the day.\n\nThen I sit in bed and I start planning my day.

I do not want you to drain my energy, or to drive my mind to that dark place again. \n\nYour presence made me lose motivation in my studies and the connection I had with my friends already [among many other things] so I do not really understand why you are still here. I mean, what do you want? I think you just want to destroy everything I have, and everything I am. Every day you deteriorate a bit more my identity, thanks to you I am completely lost.\n\nBut not today. Because even if you want to, today you will not have the energy to stop me, today it is me who controls you. I know I cannot fight you, but I want you to try and exhaust you until you vanish. Because this is what you deserve. \n\nSo good luck with that, I really want to see you try.\n\nBest regards,\nYour owner.",

I know Im being a bitch about it and I only want to be a better friend for them, but I still cant shake the feeling Im a burden an they're just gonna enjoy my absence and joke about how clingy and needy I am.\n\nUpdate: they just acknowledged me to say I shouldnt be upset because im going on a trip while they dont. I dont even wanna go.\nThey will just say they are busy once I came back and it hurts so much, or to hang out with other friends whom, btw, argued with me or hurt my feelings when I visited them.

I've been through everything from worrying about basic things, to feeling like I am about to die and being physically unable to leave my room or house without throwing up. \n\nI know how hard it is to live with and I know living with it can make it hard to talk to others about it. I have been through every single emotion that comes along with anxiety and have learnt so many things along the way, that I think that I can help a lot of you.\n\nSo whether you want to talk about something small, something you did, something you are proud of or even just what you are nervous about or how you are feeling, feel free to send me a message. \n\nNo matter how difficult things might seem, we all need a friend and I am just letting you all know I am here if you need some help. I am willing to do this for as long as it takes (whether it be hours, days, months etc.), it's not just 'a next few hours' thing. So if you see this in years to come, I'm probably still here :P\n\nI'm a male from Australia in my early 20's if you would like a bit of context about me.\n\n*I'm not a psychologist or doctor, just someone with first hand experience*",
