As well as my tremoring is coming back a lot now especially when I wake up in the mornings. I started almost two months ago with 5mg 3x a day on Valium now I\u2019m down to 2.7mg 2x a day morning and night for the past 3 weeks or so and I don\u2019t know if my problems are something else all together, anxiety or medication related but I couldn\u2019t wait another day to see if they would go away I was in lots of pain. \n\nHave any of you been to the er a lot for something you thought wasn\u2019t anxiety and you couldn\u2019t wait it out then the dr just said it ended up just being anxiety related again? I\u2019m just scared if they say it\u2019s only anxiety and then no one will believe me when I have any more symptoms anymore. It just sucks having anxiety.",

My school years were awful, I missed too many days of school because of paralyzing anxiety and eventually dropped out in the 10th grade. Now at age 25, I\u2019ve been working minimum wage jobs and have left most of them abruptly because I experience extreme panic and I start to have catastrophic thoughts which are followed by draining depressive episodes.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I\u2019m unemployed with no education and my resume is very choppy. How do people with bad employment records find jobs? It doesn\u2019t help that I am lazy and can\u2019t stick to any commitments or goals.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I feel so isolated because my peers are finishing their degrees and starting careers and families while I\u2019m still living at home like a hermit. I\u2019ve started to abuse alcohol which has caused my anxiety to heighten when I\u2019m sober and I\u2019ve gained almost 40 lbs because of my unhealthy lifestyle.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Is anyone else in a similar situation? I feel like I have no one to relate to. My close friends have dealt with mental illness as well but it hasn\u2019t stopped them from accomplishing wonderful things. I\u2019ve caused strain in my relationships because I constantly cancel plans because I\u2019m ashamed of myself and I\u2019d rather be alone.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I\u2019ve been to counseling throughout my life and even tried hypnotherapy but I haven\u2019t had much luck yet. I\u2019ve been on and off medication since I was 10 but it only helps so much. It\u2019s so frustrating because I\u2019m my own worst enemy and all my failures are to blame by me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Does anyone have any tips or tricks? Please excuse my bad grammar.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Thanks for reading&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

            "selftext": "I\u2019ve recently started my first ever job at a pretty well known retail chain (which I won\u2019t mention the name of because my experience does not represent every store nor do I want to tarnish its name in any way) and it has been an overall horrible experience destroying my mental health. \n\nFor a little background I\u2019m an 18 year old female with anxiety. \n\nI started this job with no experience in retail, my sister having helped me apply and get in. Whilst going in to do paperwork before starting I wasn\u2019t given any contact details for managers or the store. These were given to me by my sister, a manager at another store, after telling her I was never given anything. My first ever shift\u2014which I must mention I was never notified of the date, again I found this out due to my sister\u2014consisted of me being thrown in the deep end. I was put on with nobody in my department and given a rough 5min tour of the areas I need to look after and then left alone with a small introduction to what I was to do. I was very under prepared. I didn\u2019t see the manager once that whole time, nor was I checked up on by people regularly. It was just me alone confused and lost for the entire 5 hour shift. I was never introduced to the people I work with or given a proper tour involving departments and or where things are I was just left alone. I have still, 3 weeks, later never been put on with someone in my department to teach me how to do things or properly \u2018trained\u2019 (which will come into play later. I have again not been told of things that seem rather important to know such as the morning meeting I was unaware of and how to get in to the store before retail hours and when exact these hours start.\n\nI\u2019ve had approximately 5 break downs already from the stress of it. The work I do isn\u2019t significantly hard\u2014expect for the strain on my muscles from moving heavy boxes\u2014just processing stock and putting it out on the floor. I think it\u2019s more emotionally draining than it is physically, as I have to suppress my emotions back until I get home and my mind is always on alert. It\u2019s become a question of whether I want to continue feeling this way and stay or quit and in my parents words \u201cgive up\u201d. \n\nIf I leave I\u2019m putting my sister in a bad position because it was her that helped me get this job. She and my parents have said the store has put in time and money to train me but it doesn\u2019t feel this way considering my experience. If I leave I\u2019m leaving the store a staff down during the Christmas season. If I leave my parents think I\u2019m giving up despite what they say about the decision being up to me. They think that this will set a pattern of me running away from stressful situations. If I stay I am miserable and the pain I have caused them from being unhappy will more than likely continue. I\u2019ve worn them down they have said, that they can\u2019t keep seeing me like this or doing this. I\u2019m so lost and I just don\u2019t know what to do. I am so emotionally drained from not just this but school being over and having my life ahead of me I just don\u2019t have the means of communicating how I feel and identifying the reasons for why I feel this way. \n\nI understand anxiety is fuelling my thoughts and the underlying reason for my reaction to this but it\u2019s not like I can shut it off at anytime, it\u2019s a constant I just and have had to live with. I don\u2019t know what to do, whether to stay in this job or leave. Has anyone had a similar experience to this or advice as to what I should do?\n\n\nP.s. Sorry for terrible format I use mobile. Posted to r/advice too. ",

The next day in class it became more frequent until it was every third beat or so, it was very unsettling and uncomfortable. I managed to leave to go to the nurse before I had what I think was a panic attack. \n\nToday I\u2019m getting the same freaky heartbeat every once in a while like I did last Sunday, even though I\u2019m trying to take some real deep breaths every so often, and I actually don\u2019t feel to stressed other than this. \n\nThe thing is, I\u2019m in a pretty good mood, and when it happened in school I was in a great mood until that point, so I\u2019m really confused and not sure how I can help myself.

So the story is my buddy and I bout butterfly knives (they are legal in the state I live in) and we learned a ass ton of tricks with them. Last night I went to his house and I left mine at home (you aren't allowed to carry one in public). So he ended up telling me that he cut himself on it like 4 times but he cleaned his knife. From the looks of it, the knife was clean, no blood or anything. Long story short my stupid ass ended up putting myself on his knife like 8 times and I put my finger in my mouth after I cut myself without thinking. This didn't occur how dangerous this could be until after everything happened. So the question is, do I have hiv or aids? He told me that he doesn't have anything and I even told my mom this. She said I'm freaking out over nothing but I can't shake the idea of it from my mind. She told me he wouldn't have let me play with his knife if he knew he had some disease or something. The knife wasn't dripping with blood or anything but I'm genuenly worried. I'm frantically typing this at work rn and I'm about to cry. I'm only 19 and I don't want my life to be ruined. Please give thoughts. Call me an idiot I know I am one. I just need some outside feedback. ",
