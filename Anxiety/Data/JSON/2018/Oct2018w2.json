            "selftext": "Sorry for any mobile formatting issues.\n\nSo I've had anxiety all my life (I'm 26F). I've never had tightness in my chest and numbness in my left arm because of it, so when I had those things last night I panicked. I also had vertigo. So yeah I called the ambulance the first time. My vitals were fine though my blood pressure was high. I don't have $700 for an ambulance since I don't have health insurance if I'm not having a heart attack or stroke so I sent them away. My husband closed the door as they left then handed me a bottle of water. I take a sip, then another, then a couple big gulps. INCOMING WAVE OF VERTIGO SO STRONG IT KNOCKS ME ON MY ASS.\n\nSo naturally I freak out and scream at my husband and tell him to get them back. These poor men wasting their time on my anxious ass, they basically help me down to me car with my dorky husband who I love following behind, put me in my car, and then my husband drives to the hospital.\n\nI get checked in, and then wait, then get triaged and the nurse does an EKG, then I go back out to the waiting room again. Clearly I should take this as a sign that I'm probably fine otherwise they would have taken me back right away. I'm not one to ever have an attitude with someone directly, so I wait patiently holding my heart thinking that if I'm gonna have a heart attack this is probably the best place to have one but slightly annoyed because I'm definitely sure that I'm probably dying at this point so patience wasn't my virtue lol. So they finally take me to a room. The doctor and his nurse come in and I tell him what's wrong. I tell him the only health problem I have is anxiety and he says that my problem is probably an anxiety attack, but he was a good guy and ordered a chest X-Ray just to make sure and gave me some ibuprofen and Motrin in case of any inflammation. So I get the X-ray and wait for 20 mins, holding my husband's hand while I'm laying in what I assume is now my death bed thinking of all the things I could have done with my life and how my husband is going to survive without me. I'm crying obviously, and thinking about what I'm going to write here in my last days of life that could hopefully inspire others to not waste their youth like I had.\n\nLOL.\n\nFinally the doctor comes back in and before he even says anything my first question is \"am I dying?\" And he shakes his head. And then I ask \"is anything wrong with me or is this just anxiety?\" And he tells me nothing is wrong and it's probably an anxiety attack. And at this point like half of my anxiety just leaves because I'm not dying anymore, but I am honestly bewildered that anxiety could do this to me. Really anxiety? You had to make me think I was having a damn stroke at 26? And he gives me some reccomendations and I politely nod and thank him. He asks me if I want to take some anxiety medicine and I nod and say yes please. So the nurse comes to give me a valium and take my vitals again. Then the registration lady tells me my balance of $354 and Honestly? It was a relief, because my dramatic ass thought I was gonna have to pay $1,000 or something. \n\nAnd after all of this, I'm angry at anxiety. What if one day I actually have a heart attack but dismiss it because I think it's anxiety and then just die? Yet at the same time, this taught me a lesson: GO GET MEDICATION! I am not super woman, I can't just fight off anxiety with my sheer will power like I'm the incredible frickin hulk, I need to literally go see my psychiatrist and humble my ass and ask for a damn benzo. I hope me going to the hospital will make him take this thing seriously enough to give me a decent dose instead of giving me a damn vitamin ass dose of klonopin once a day and wasting my time. \n\nIf you read this all the way through, thank you. Take your meds, okay? Don't be like me and wait until you have a mock heart attack to take anxiety seriously. ",

A friend came over and wanted to watch Black Mirror so I barely slept that night.\n\nAny time I see documentaries about politics and war and stuff I start thinking about NWO/satanic conspiracies and getting super paranoid. It's like an automatic visceral response where I think everyone could be part of some satanic child molesting cabal and that nothing in the world actually matters. And I'm not even religious. I get afraid that I'll develop schizophrenia and get a delusion about the NWO and think that they are after me. Of course now I think all that stuff is bullshit and I just got some faulty brain chemistry or something.\n\nI used to love horror and action movies and now I can't enjoy anything. My favorite movies used to be Hellraiser, Alien, Friday the 13th...now I can barely watch the CNN decades series because it makes me think about government conspiracies and shit. ",

That day I was admitted to a partial hospitalization program and started Wednesday. So far it's been pretty nice. The therapists are great, the doctor is funny, and my fellow patients are supportive. \n\nIt's a lot different than anything I've done before with lots of group therapy. They changed my medications around Friday and added Celexa in with my Effexor. I'm hopeful that this will be a positive experience and that I will learn better coping skills so that next semester's return to nursing school will be successful. ",

            "selftext": "Hello everyone. I constantly suffer from anxiety but some days are better than others. Some days are very bad though. \n\nRecently I had a bad day and had troubles breathing. I just felt as if my chest was very right and I had to inhale very deeply in order to feel like I was even getting air in my system. It came out of nowhere and then quickly after my heart rate went up. I could feel it beating faster. It stayed that way for a while. I have no idea why. When this happens, I began to feel anxious and things just worsen. I just feel on edge. \nThis happens frequently though. The weird chest feeling and heart rate combo. \n\nAnyway, this particular moment I started feeling like I was gonna cry. I could feel tears welling up but I didn\u2019t know why it was happening or what I was crying about. My friend was with me and when she asked what I was upset about I truly had no idea. It just came over me. I stepped away to cry bc it was a very overwhelming feeling. \n\nMy friend said she thought it might be an anxiety attack. I was always under the impression that anxiety attacks were more serious and the times I\u2019ve heard about them, people mentioned feeling like they were gonna pass out. \n\nI guess I just never thought those feelings were serious enough to be considered an anxiety attack. I\u2019m still unsure. How can I know when I have an anxiety attack? Does anyone else get those feelings? \nThanks in advance for any answers/explanations/advice! \n",

A little background about me, most of the time I\u2019m a normal functioning human being and can interact with strangers with ease. When I get to my workplace, it is a completely different story and I\u2019m hit with almost crippling social anxiety. I can generally interact with those I work closely with without issue, however, when it comes to attending meetings or having to be put on the spot in any way shape or form, I buckle like a fucking twig. The worst part is the visible signs, my face will immediately change colors to red and purple in blotchy sections on my face and neck. This amplifies my anxiety and I have trouble speaking or getting across a coherent thought. It is honestly devestating and at the age of 33, am disappointed in myself that I haven\u2019t overcome this issue. \n\nAt this point in my life, I feel like I will be unable to really succeed in the business world until I can learn to manage my anxiety and be able to contribute in meetings and presentations. I\u2019m currently getting my MBA and know that I will have to do presentations eventually to graduate. I have tried beta blockers without success and would really like to avoid having to take a stronger medication. Does anyone have any advice on supplements or hippie oils that might help?\n\nAgain, I am new so I apologize if this is a common thread on this site.

You can use your own quote, but this one is so so profound and perfect.\n In Frank Herber's \"Dune\" book series (which is by the way an ah-maziiing Sci fi fantasy that inspired Star Wars) there is this mantra that people say to deal with paralyzing fear. In the book series, people have involved into highly intelligent beings capable to control their body and mind to the fullest degree. And that's the trick they use in their crazy war if a life: \n\n\"I must not fear.\nFear is the mind-killer.\nFear is the little-death that brings total obliteration.\nI will face my fear.\nI will permit it to pass over me and through me.\nAnd when it has gone past I will turn the inner eye to see its path.\nWhere the fear has gone there will be nothing.\nOnly I will remain.\"\n\nI have repeated it in my head again and again and again in horrible situations, once even my life was kind of in danger, lol, and every world of it was PERFECT, it just makes so much sense. Fear is just a feeling. If it weren't here I would be able to achieve so much more success an any given situation. It comes and goes and I'm the constant. Also, it distracts you, gives your mind some release from racing thoughts and calms you down by the repetition alone. Reciting uses the logical part of your brain to cancel out the screaming emotional part. And in the end of the day, that litany is some damn good advice. Try this or any other mantra and hopefully it helps you as well! ",

I do an online program which is really nice because I don\u2019t have to physically go to college or be surrounded by people. The only downside though is all of my classes are shortened. So basically instead of 16 weeks for a class, my class is done in 8 weeks but it\u2019s still 16 weeks of work and information.\n\nSo needless to say the work is a lot. Now I\u2019ve never been good a school but I\u2019ve just found myself really struggling lately. I can concentrate on anything and it\u2019s taking me triple the time to do assignments that normally I would have no problem on.\n\nI honestly think this is all linked to my anxiety, which has been getting worse and worse. I haven\u2019t seen a doctor yet because I don\u2019t have one but I know I need to. But my question is, is should I take time off school while I try and get a handle on my anxiety/get on medication. \n\nAnd also if I take time off does anyone know if it effects loans? I think my school may have a medical leave sort of thing but I don\u2019t know how it will effect my loans, because I can\u2019t afford to start paying them yet and I\u2019m afraid if I take time off I\u2019ll have to start paying.

            "selftext": "Yesterday was world mental health day, and I spent a lot of time thinking about my journey this past year and all the shit that I have had to go through in order to be in a place now where I feel comfortable waking up, facing the world, and facing myself.\n\nI have had general anxiety for as long as I can remember, but it was only about a year ago that I truly started to feel like I was on the verge of death. I remember being at college and walking up a flight of stairs to class and getting to the top and being SO out of breath. That was the first time I started to believe that something was truly wrong with me: a tumor in my lungs (my grandfather had found a tumor in his lung about a year prior and died 6 months after), a deflated lung, some heart murmur, or something that would put me on my death bed sooner rather than later. After multiple (and multiple) doctors appointments trying to convince my GP that I was on the verge of death, he said he thought it was simple anxiety and nothing to worry about. That's when things started to go downhill for me.\n\nBeing told that I had anxiety was not some saving grace for me, because I truly had no support around me (which is something that I believe that many people here and in general deal with, and mostly why I'm writing this post). My parents had never experienced anxiety before, so when I told them that I didn't feel like doing anything that day or if I just started crying because I felt anxious, they truly thought that I was either a) overexaggerating whatever problem I felt or b) begging for attention. This only made me more anxious, and only exacerbated the problem.\n\nMy friends, also, had never had anxiety. One of my friends is so care-free and doesn't get anxious about anything, and when I would confine in her about how I was feeling, she would tell me to \"snap out of it\" or \"get through it.\" My worst panic attacks my senior year of college were at parties, and when I started to realize this, I spent a lot of time alone and avoiding these parties, to which her reply was \"we only live once, you're being annoying and you're going to regret this.\"\n\nI am writing this for the person reading this who feels like they are not understood. You are allowed, and encouraged, to do WHATEVER YOU WANT (of course, considering legal limits) to deal with your anxiety. If you want to go drink with friends, GO. If you want to stay in and watch Netflix, STAY IN. Your mental health is YOUR mental health. It's no one else's. I understand that not everyone sees mental health the same way, but believe me, even if it feels like no one is on your side, we all are.\n\nSince then, I have come to find that one of my best friends has been battling life crippling anxiety for a lot longer than I knew her for. We are able to confine in each other about our anxiety attacks, our problems, and our worries. Our good days and our bad days. You will find people who love you, and respect your mental health. Please, please please, remember that. Until then, I am always a message away. I hope no one ever feels as misunderstood as I did. xoxo ",

            "selftext": "Each week is getting harder and harder for me. I've been \"working\" at home doing art and it suited me well for a little while, but in the last few years my anxiety has gotten worse and worse as I've gone through some really traumatic struggles and now I can't even sit still and focus on anything for more than a few minutes at a time.\n\nI have clients angry at me, utilities about to shut off, overdue house payments and a massive mountain of to-do items that I can't even deal with without having a panic attack for no goddamn reason. \n\nI'm seeing a psychiatrist and therapist, I'm on Prozac which is somewhat helpful, in that I don't want to die anymore, but I can't get to \"normal\" feeling point for more than a few hours out of a week.\n\nI want to reduce stressors in every way possible, and one of my worst monsters right now is the constant struggle to scrape a few dollars together just to afford cat food, much less the really urgent stuff. I did a quick search for applying for disability benefits and while it seems I may qualify, every site seems to be a law office.\n\nDo I really need to hire a lawyer to submit an application? \n\nWhat do I need to have in order to support my claim?\n\nDo I need a diagnosis or evaluation by primary care physician as well as my current psych/therapist? \n\nHow hard is the process or approval? \n\nI'm not looking for a handout and feel deep shame at even the idea of getting even a small benefit, but the way things are going right now, I'm going to end up in a ditch or under a bridge if I can't get some breathing room.",

            "selftext": "Hey there, if this is not the right subreddit, please let me know. I'm at a point where I'm completely lost and need some feedback, and figured reddit might be of help. \n\nI'll try to shortly sketch my situation. I've always been a very insecure person, and  bullying experiences obviously did not do me any good. I'm now 24 years old and studying to be nurse (which I am very passionate about). I have these days where for no reason I am extremely down on myself. I have zero controle over my emotions and everything around me is negative. It feels negative. The slightest remark can throw me completely off balance. And I hate to lose this control. At those times I am not kind to those around which I always regret when I come to my senses. On the contrary I also have days where I'm very inspired, creative and optimistic. Those kind of days happen at randomly. This week I started my first internship for school to learn some basics of the job as a nurse. I started early this morning and every mistake I made got pointed out (obviously, since I have to learn and get feedback). I felt my throat tighten up and tears coming up and tried to surpress this. The nurse guiding me noticed my eyes were red and told me to not pannick, this made it worse. I had to breath in and out a few times to get to my senses. But throughout the whole day this never got better. I felt extremely sensitive for everything around me, the slightes remark, or look threw me off. I felt so insecure and lost without any control of my emotions. I held my tears in for the rest of the day but was constantly on the break of crying. Untill my shift almost ended. I had to write a selfreflection and completely crashed. I started sweating heavily and crying and sobbing. My breathing was unsteady and I just couldn't calm down. Everyone was so suprised and I felt so ashamed. People were comforting me saying, you can make mistakes, you'll learn and grow etc.. But those words did not calm me down. When I walked home I cried even more, I have completely lost control of my emotions and this makes me so angry. I'm afraid this will start interfering with future work too.. I'm lost. Is this all due to my insecurity? am I depressed or something? fear of failing? anxiety? Does anyone else have this feeling? ",
