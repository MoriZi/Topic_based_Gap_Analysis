Today I woke up at 5, waited until 6 to take my SSRI, which is a small victory cause I usually knock it back the second I wake up, and I think that might affect its potency. I sat down and had a whole cup of decaf tea and a full serving of oatmeal with berries. It took me almost 20 minutes, but it\u2019s a huge leap from taking half an hour to finish maybe one egg. After the last panic attack I had I was still in a bad place by this point and couldn\u2019t eat until noon, so see this as a sign that the work I\u2019m doing is helping.\n\nHow do *you* know when you\u2019re in a period of \u201cgetting better\u201d?",

            "selftext": "For some absurd reason I have always had terrible anxiety with making and receiving phone calls. Last summer I was working in an office for a few weeks where my manager asked me to make a phone call to another company, it literally took me 45 minutes of staring at the phone (pretending to do other work) before I could get the courage to pick up the phone. I had to write notes on a piece of paper so that if I lost my trail of thought I'd have some guidance, it just feels pathetic.\n\nI think what worries me is that you can't have any awkward silences on the phone, the conversation has to remain constant. I also hate other people listening to my phone call, if I can't answer a question or stutter over something I'm completely aware that everyone around me can hear it. It's reached the stage where a phone ringing is like an alarm going off, it sends my brain into panic mode, I have no idea who I'm about to speak to or what could be asked of me.\n\nDoes anyone else have any experience in dealing with telephobia? I don't know what I can do to alleviate the problem.",

My hands and forehead go numb, I grind my teeth, sharp head aches and blurry vision. I've had two EKG's because I thought I was having a heart attack or a stroke. We all express it in different ways, but it helps me so much just knowing that I'm not alone. I'm not saying I'm happy that you guys also feel bad, I'm just saying it reminds me that I'm human. So yeah. You guys have unknowingly pulled me out of countless full blown panic attacks, and I am more grateful for that than I could possibly say. ",

It will basically have live entertainment, stores, bouncy castles etc. I\u2019ve been told from fellow co-workers that the pub will get busy beyond belief and people will essentially be queuing for drinks outside. You may be thinking that I\u2019m obviously not the only member of staff working. But, there are not many members of staff in general who work there. There are only 6-7 of us, there are others who are both covering day and evening shifts. 3 bar rooms will also be in use. The last time the bar was incredibly busy was when the local football team were playing on tv and that mentally broke me. I\u2019m genuinely so nervous and I just want today to end already.",

            "selftext": "Healing is not linear.\n\nProgress is not linear. It has ups &amp; downs. \n\nI'm someone who's had their anxiety under control for the past four years &amp; as someone with generalised anxiety disorder, I still go through bouts of anxious behavior/actions every day. But just because that is a truth I live with, I have learned to communicate with it to the point that allows me to be functioning and thriving.\n\nBut.\n\nJust today I almost had a very bad anxiety attack. One that ruined my entire first half of the day. One that I just laid in bed naked, crying about. I felt weak both mentally and physically. I felt trapped in a body that didn't believe that I could function in a space of fear. I felt as if my body did not trust me to be a functioning and productive vessel of this earth. Luckily, I had a therapist appointment today. One that I told my best friend, \"I have no idea what we will even talk about today! I've been great!\" only to have the rest happen.\n\nAs a mental health advocate, well-known in my city, I fear that I will go back to the days where I was agoraphobic and thought that I would never be able to be a functioning member of society due to debilitating fear. I cried the moment I entered the door. I cried because of fear. I cried because I was not breathing for the good first 5 hours of my day. I cried because suddenly I was on a bridge with no place to run and I had no idea what it was I needed. I thought to myself, \"am I always going to go back?\"...\"will my anxiety always win?\" and the answer is no.\n\nI did not lose. It did not win. I just let it boss me around. Just because you have done everything well and you've been feeling great, doesn't mean you're not allowed to accept the fact that you are human and things happen. Do yourself the favor of not judging yourself, accepting yourself radically for who you are, and reminding yourself that healing isn't a straight line forward. It's a lot of hills, loops, and jumps...because that is life.\n\nLiving with generalised anxiety disorder can be difficult but when you celebrate the accomplishments versus feeling bad for yourself for things that don't go right, life feels better and it's all based on what you choose to focus on.\n\nLittle things to us are HUGE. Little things to others, remain little things. We, after all, are getting the truest experience of life.\n\nThe ever-flowing moments of life and death yet, we always survive.\n\nKeep surviving. Keep healing and be your biggest cheerleader. Others can't forgive you as well as you can forgive yourself.\n\nI hope this helped someone. &lt;3",

We have our hearts set in the right direction. We don't manipulate people. We are friendly, kind, and fun to be around. People like us. Remember that the next time you're struggling. There are people out there doing all sorts of bad things but it's not us. We do the opposite and do good and help others. We have traits many don't, and that's a good thing! ",
