            "selftext": "So if you\u2019re reading this and currently in the midst of an anxiety disorder, let me start by saying I know how you feel. I\u2019ve had panic attacks where the adrenaline rushes just don\u2019t stop, I\u2019ve been nauseated and unable to eat or drink for days on end, I\u2019ve felt so short of breath it was like drowning above water, had the jitters and the lump in my throat. I\u2019ve also had all of the uncomfortable mental symptoms. I\u2019ve dissociated for almost a full day multiple times, I\u2019ve had racing, intrusive thoughts that lasted weeks and sometimes months at a time. And I\u2019ve felt like I was going crazy. A lot.\n\nBut I\u2019m here to tell you my struggle with my anxiety disorder is over. After almost a year of conscious and concerted effort, all of the worst symptoms of my anxiety are completely gone. Some of the more mild ones still appear from time to time; I\u2019ll get fatigued or dizzy/foggy maybe once every few weeks, but this happens so infrequently (and becomes less frequent with each occurrence) that it doesn\u2019t really bug me. I was also on medication (an SSRI since day one and a benzo for the first few months) and am in the process of tapering off .\n\nSo I wanted to write a post about how to get over each stage of your anxiety, mainly because I know I really would have appreciated this kind of guidance when I first sought help in late April of last year. If you want a summary of things you can do regardless of what stage you\u2019re at, scroll to the bottom and check the paragraph in bold.\n\nI don\u2019t discuss responses to specific symptoms here, just a general approach. If you\u2019re looking for tactics for specific symptoms, check out the list of books I left in the second section. I think the first one does a particularly good job of addressing every symptom, but you can try the third if you don\u2019t feel it makes enough of a difference.\n\nBefore you read, I want to mention something once so I don\u2019t have to later on. Recovery is going to be like a rollercoaster. Some days you\u2019ll feel like you made incredible progress, and others you\u2019ll have difficulty even doing simple tasks. It\u2019s going to be a lot of two steps forward, one step back. Sometimes it\u2019ll even be two steps forward, two steps back. But even those times are okay, because they serve as proof that you are capable of improving. Just know that once you start to give effort, things will start gradually getting better.\n\nSo here it is. My comprehensive guide to recovering from an anxiety disorder.\n\nIf you\u2019re at a constant 9/10 - 10/10 anxiety and can\u2019t calm down:\n\nAt this stage, you\u2019re either in the middle of panic attack (which lasts up to 60 minutes) or you have GAD and are constantly anxious. I was diagnosed with GAD and Pure-O but I\u2019ve had maaaaaany panic attacks, so I know this advice will work for both.\n\n**1.** Stop trying to fight your anxiety symptoms. Understand that the best thing you can do for your body right now is just let it run its course. This is the basis of Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) which is one of the types of therapy currently used to treat anxiety disorders. To do this:\n\n* Don\u2019t try to stop any symptoms you are experiencing. This is infinitely easier said than done at first, but with practice you\u2019ll be able to pick this up fairly quickly. When I was first having constant adrenaline rushes, I kept trying to consciously stop them. This was actually making things worse. The more you try to fight your symptoms, the more worried you become, which in turn causes your system to release more of the stress-causing hormones, causing your symptoms to become worse. The best thing you can do at this point is wait it out and let your body tire itself out. \n\n* Questions, doubts, and fear will come up. When they do, remind yourself that this is a totally normal process that your body is going through, and try to rest in the anxiety. It may be difficult, but try to ease into the symptoms. This was initially what helped my adrenaline rushes decrease in severity and frequency.\n\n* If this isn\u2019t working and you find your symptoms are still persisting and won\u2019t stop, ask for more. As the DARE Response (discussed later) puts it, run towards your symptoms. If you\u2019ve ever read a book on ACT, this step is likely in there. When you ask your body to make your symptoms worse, you\u2019ll find it can\u2019t. The symptoms of anxiety are driven by a subconscious worry, and not something you can control. Keep running towards it until your symptoms gradually begin to ease, then move on to step 2. In case you\u2019re interested, the clinical term for this is \u201carousal reappraisal.\u201d It\u2019s not discussed very often, but I found it to be very helpful. \n\n**2.** Do anything you possibly can to get your mind off of the anxiety. In older forms of anxiety treatment, this kind of thing was referred to as a distraction tactic, but in The DARE Response, Barry McDonagh calls it being \u201cengaged.\u201d This basically means do whatever you can to focus your mind on something other than your anxiety. Regardless of what level of anxiety you\u2019re at, this is incredibly important. **Your anxiety is most easily fueled when you focus on it, so do whatever you can to move your attention to something else.** Again, MUCH easier said than done, and your mind will fight you at every stage. But it\u2019s an integral part of recovery. When I first started out, I found short activities the most helpful, like picking up my guitar/cajon and playing a song or two, or doing homework. \n\n**3.** Give it time. Your system can\u2019t sustain anxiety levels this high for an extended period of time unless you consciously fuel it. If you are properly easing into your symptoms and engaging yourself in other activities you\u2019ll eventually calm down to the next phase of anxiety recovery.\n\n**4.** If recommended by your physician, a benzo might help. Benzos are basically nervous system relaxants, but they\u2019re no magic pill. When I took my first dose of valium, I didn\u2019t feel a thing. It took a few days of constant dosing to see any effect. Benzos are fine to use in the very beginning, but I will issue a warning about them: try to use them as sparingly as possible. Benzos are not meant to be used in the long term, and if the first thing you do when feeling anxious is reach for your benzo, you\u2019ll have real difficulty recovering in the later stages. But since at this point, you\u2019re in a constant state of panic, they\u2019re a great way to ease you down to the next lowest stage of anxiety, so you can start focusing on the long term.\n\n**5.** Journal. I don\u2019t recommend this as much beyond this stage, as I\u2019ve found it doesn\u2019t really help all that much. But in the beginning stages of my experience with GAD, I found journaling to be an indispensable asset to really figure out what I was going through. Just write out whatever you\u2019re thinking or feeling. It\u2019s a great what to get out of your head for at least a little bit.\n\n**6.** Get up and do something to release all your pent up adrenaline. Walk around the block, take a stretch break at work. You don\u2019t need to be doing a full workout at this point, just something to help you use the jitters and adrenaline you\u2019re getting for something productive.\n\n**7.** This one may seem rather minor, but it helped me a lot in the beginning: fix your posture. It\u2019s much easier to feel short of breath when you\u2019re in a position that doesn\u2019t let you breath easily. If you\u2019re lying down, lay on your back. If you\u2019re sitting, sit up straight.\n\nOnce you\u2019ve thoroughly calmed down from this point (this took me about three or four weeks), you can move on to the next step.\n\nConstant 6 - 8/10 with occasional panic attacks:\n\nIf you\u2019re at this phase, you are probably still experiencing physical manifestations of your anxiety, like jitters, nausea, jelly legs, shortness of breath, and so on. But you\u2019re not in constant freakout mode anymore. You can make logical decisions aimed more at long term recovery because rather than being focused on your anxiety 100% of the time, you pay attention to it 80 - 90% of the time. You may be leaving the house occasionally but your symptoms are still bad enough that they keep you at home most of the time. So here\u2019s what to do at this stage:\n\n**1. Start reading or listening to books on what you\u2019re going through**. The more you understand the subtleties of what\u2019s going on in your brain and body, the better you\u2019ll be able fix them. Read up on therapy techniques as they\u2019ll be your quickest route to recovery. In the end, this ended up being the single most helpful thing for my recovery. When you\u2019re knowledgeable of exactly what is at your disposal, you can try everything and see what works best for you. In fact, I found really helpful ideas in books that none of my therapists had even heard of. Like your anxiety, the list of books that will be the most helpful for you is very personalized, but here are my recommendations (all of these books are available on Audible, which is how I consumed them):\n\n* The DARE Response. Phenomenal book written by someone who\u2019s been through the worst parts of anxiety and paved his own path to recovery. His techniques are a combination between ACT and a little CBT. I would especially recommend this book if you\u2019re at the higher end of the anxiety scale.\n\n* Feeling Good: The New Mood Therapy. This book is considered the gold standard of CBT. It\u2019s aimed at treating depression, but (as the author notes) it works for anxiety as well. I listened to the whole thing, then picked out the chapters I thought applied to me. It\u2019s long, so I don\u2019t think you need to do the first part, but there\u2019s a lot of valuable information in this book that a lot of other books skim over.\n\n* Rewire Your Anxious Brain. This one is 1/4 CBT, 1/4 lifestyle guidance, and half about the neuroscience behind anxiety. I like this one a lot because it gets into some of the mechanics of why we feel the way we do, and why therapy and lifestyle changes are so impactful.\n\n* The Subtle Art of Not Giving a Fuck. This one has been mentioned on this subreddit several times before, and I really like it. It serves as a great reminder of why some things in life just aren\u2019t worth giving a fuck about. Fair warning: Mark Manson describes OCD as \u201can incurable disease\u201d in this book. He\u2019s not a doctor or therapist and isn\u2019t really knowledgeable on the subject, so I\u2019d take that section with a grain of salt. But the message he drives home at the end is really good regardless.\nRemember, the point of these books isn\u2019t to give you step by step instructions on how to get better. Rather they are there to give you ideas on how to best help yourself.\n\n**2.** Get into therapy. This is perhaps the second most important things you can do for yourself behind reading. Therapy is the first line of treatment for anxiety, and for good reason. Once you find a therapist who you work well with, you\u2019ll notice you progress much more quickly. Some things to look out for when you screen your therapist:\n\n* Are they nice? Kind of an obvious one but worth going over. Do you feel like they take what you\u2019re saying seriously? Are their answers usually thoughtful and caring?\n\n* Are they experienced? My first therapist was tremendously nice and caring, but he didn\u2019t know much about anxiety treatment beyond the very basics, like square breathing. \n\n* Are they accessible? Or do you have to drive two hours to see them? Are they available for weekly sessions or can you only see them once a month?\nIt may take a while until you find a therapist who\u2019s right for you, but this is a person you\u2019ll be meeting with multiple times a month for several months/years. I would advise giving your therapist at least three or four sessions before you consider switching to a new one. \n\n**3.** Continue with all the acceptance techniques outlined in the previous section. These are things that I remind myself of even now. The more open you are towards your anxiety symptoms, the more quickly they\u2019ll dissipate. In addition, if you can, start easing off your benzo a little bit. If you\u2019re taking it three times a day, try to move down to two. If you\u2019re down to two a day, try one.\n\n**4.** Start making some lifestyle changes that are proven to help with anxiety in the long term:\n\n* Cardiovascular exercise. It\u2019s said that exercise is one of the most positive things to improve mood when you\u2019re anxious, but I\u2019d like to look at it from the opposite perspective. When you\u2019re anxious, your body is filled with excess adrenaline that keeps building up. If you don\u2019t dump it out somehow, the symptoms will inevitably get worse. So getting up from your desk or your bed is one of the most effective things you can do to help yourself in the long term. If you\u2019re not super exercise savvy, my suggestion is to get out and walk, jogging occasionally. Walking is great for releasing excess energy, but you can boost the speed at which you let off adrenaline by running. You don\u2019t need to do sprints whenever you run, but you\u2019ll get the most out of your exercise if you really challenge yourself each time. More on this later.\n\n* Meditation. The reason so many people say this is so good for anxiety is because it helps you better come to terms with your symptoms. It also lets you really hone in on some of the less productive thought processes you\u2019re having so you can learn to catch and correct them. Keep in mind, the purpose of meditation is not to clear your mind and think of nothing. In fact, it\u2019s almost the opposite. While meditating, your job is to let your body and brain work as normal and merely try to act as a conscious observer of all your thoughts and feelings. A really popular visualization technique for this is thinking of your thoughts as clouds, and you\u2019re just watching them pass by. There is plenty of information out there on how to meditate, and it includes helpful techniques like noting, so I won\u2019t go into it that much here. Make sure that your approach to meditation is similar to your approach to exercise: slowly ease into it by doing it for short periods at first, then working up very gradually to longer periods after every couple sessions. I suggest trying out the meditation app Calm.\n\n* Diet. If you\u2019re reading this, you\u2019ve probably read the do\u2019s and don\u2019ts of your diet about a hundred times, but I\u2019ll reiterate quickly here: no caffeine, no alcohol. Try your best to avoid excessive sweets and fried foods, and those are shown [1] to worsen your mood in the long term. One of the less known changes you can make to your diet is to include more natural sources of magnesium. It is speculated [2] that magnesium plays a part in anxiety regulation, though the research isn\u2019t entirely there yet. Regardless, try to include dark leafy greens like spinach and whole grains like brown rice into your diet to hit this as a staple. You can also take a magnesium supplement (I\u2019ll defer to the DARE Response for information about it), though again, research is shaky so this alone won\u2019t bring change. \n\n* Medication. This one will be completely at you/your doctor\u2019s discretion. Some people respond well to antidepressants, some don\u2019t. I didn\u2019t feel like they helped me all that much, but you might. Note, the purpose of antidepressants isn\u2019t to make you happy or to gradually cure your anxiety. Research shows [3] that antidepressants are useful for supplementing long term change in the brain. This is a REALLY important thing to note because it means that antidepressants won\u2019t change anything on their own. Only if you give conscious effort will you be able to see positive change. Medication only makes it happen more quickly.\n\n**5.** Give it time. Your nervous system doesn\u2019t change overnight. It may need a week or two more before you achieve the results you want. So just keep practicing your therapy techniques and doing everything you know works and push through.\n\nOnce you\u2019ve been at these things for a while, you\u2019ll notice your anxiety start to decrease to the next phase.\n\nHovering around 4 - 6:\n\nIf you\u2019re at this stage, congratulations! The first two stages are really hard to break out of, and if you did, it likely took a tremendous amount of effort. So give yourself a pat on the back. Once you\u2019ve reached this stage, your anxiety likely doesn\u2019t manifest itself physically as much. You may still get nauseated occasionally, but most of the time you\u2019re able to eat and drink and (hopefully) sleep through the night. You\u2019ve started reclaiming your normal life. You get out of the house relatively frequently and do things like run errands. But you\u2019re still really anxious whenever you go out. In addition, though your physical symptoms may have eased up, your mental symptoms may still be incredibly difficult to deal with. So here\u2019s what you should do at this stage:\n\n**1.** Keep staying the course. It\u2019s easy to flounder or stop, and it\u2019s okay if you do. But remember to pick up right where you left off. Also, don\u2019t beat yourself up for making mistakes. Everyone falters from time to time, it\u2019s part of what makes us human. And it\u2019s okay if things are taking longer than you expected. Take it from me that if you keep looking for ways you can improve your anxiety and practicing the techniques you know work, things will get better.\n\n**2.** Keep pushing the envelope. Identify areas of your life that you\u2019ve always been anxious about and challenge yourself to use therapy techniques to improve them. I used to beat myself up for being awkward ever since I was a little kid. I\u2019d find flaws in every interaction I had with others and nitpick every little thing. Once I started working on this, I noticed not only an improvement in these kinds of situations, but also an improvement in my overall anxiety. This is part of how Exposure and Response Prevention (ERP) therapy works. You expose yourself to situations that make your anxiety flare up, and use CBT techniques to curb your conscious worry. An important note about this is **these experiences aren\u2019t meant to be fun**. If you\u2019ve got social anxiety and you\u2019re challenging yourself by going to meet new people, it\u2019ll likely be an uncomfortable experience the first few times. People around you may be having plenty of fun while you keep worrying and criticizing yourself. But you\u2019ll slowly notice improvement, and with time, it\u2019ll become more and more natural over time.\n\n**3.** Along the same lines, start making your workouts more difficult. Run/bike/swim for longer, lift heavier weights. When you\u2019re anxious, you tend to stagnate in certain areas of your life, sometimes without realizing it. The only way to get better is to keep pushing the bounds of what you do. I saw a post on this subreddit a while ago along the lines of \u201cI\u2019ve been lightly jogging for 25 minutes a day for the last month or two, why aren\u2019t I seeing my anxiety improve?\u201d And the answer in this case is because this person wasn\u2019t pushing him/herself. If you continue to do the same things, you shouldn\u2019t expect to see improvement.\n\n**4.** Start identifying and cutting off some of your crutches/unhealthy habits. For a lot of us (me included), this comes in the form of googling symptoms or constantly asking for help on this subreddit. It\u2019s okay to cave every once in a while at this stage, but you need to consciously stop yourself from constantly asking for help on the internet. One of the things this does is keep you focused on your anxiety, which is exactly what engaging yourself is meant to prevent. I stopped browsing this subreddit for almost a half year, and my condition got much better as a result. If you\u2019re seriously concerned about something, visit your doctor/psychiatrist/therapist and ask them, but once they diagnose you, do not second guess it. I spent my entire college career going to different doctors (I think at least 10 or 11 different types, sometimes multiple doctors of each kind). I was convinced there was something wrong with me that no one could find, but the true culprit was anxiety. If you **feel** like you\u2019re constantly sick or dying, yet doctors can\u2019t find anything wrong, this is a clue that you have an issue with being a hypochondriac. You can go about fixing this the way you did in all areas of your therapy (I personally used the CBT method outlined in Feeling Good), but the important thing is to recognize that just because your brain is telling you something doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s true. \n\n**5.** Give it time. I\u2019ve said it before but it\u2019s important to reiterate. Recovering from this stage might take several months, so try your best to be patient. And remember, if things aren\u2019t the way you want them to be now, they will be soon.\n\nI think it\u2019s also important to discuss the idea of **cognitive fusion**, which you may have come across in your book reading, as I think understanding it will be really helpful. Google defines cognitive fusion as attaching a thought to an experience, but since that\u2019s kind of vague, I\u2019ll give my own definition. Cognitive fusion is when you take what your thoughts tell you as fact. In other words, you\u2019re using your thoughts to draw irrational conclusions about the world around you. One example of this is if you\u2019re someone who criticizes themselves too much. You might tell yourself \u201cthat conversation was so awkward, so that person must think I\u2019m a loser.\u201d In this case, whether or not the situation was awkward, you don\u2019t know what the other person is thinking. I used to think this a lot until I realized people really didn\u2019t see me that way, and all the worrying I did was for nothing. A healthy level of questioning can do lots to help you overcome your anxiety.\n\nAt this stage, I had the most trouble with mental symptoms, namely the feeling of going crazy. I thought the little floaters in my eyes were hallucinations, I always second guessed my own sanity, I thought the weird dreams or intrusive thoughts I was having were a sign of schizophrenia, and anytime I was happy, I thought it was a sign of bipolar disorder. This is another great example of cognitive fusion that took me a while to get over: I thought I was going crazy, so to me that was evidence that I really was. If you think this describes you, it might do you well to get into the habit of questioning your thoughts as well. Is it more logical that your psychiatrist, therapists, family, and friends are correct when they say you\u2019re not crazy and are just experiencing symptoms of anxiety, or that you\u2019re the one person out of the fifty who\u2019s somehow figured out you\u2019re losing it? This applies to basically every anxious situation you may encounter. Remember: **just because you think something doesn\u2019t make it true**.\n\nOne of the things that took me a long time to realize was that my constant worry over these things was caused by the fact that I was paying so much attention to them. At this point in recovery, it\u2019s absolutely **imperative that you keep yourself occupied, especially when you\u2019re most anxious**. I found that doing things like cooking and cleaning were ways to keep my mind off my anxiety without having to think about it. I suggest doing the same, as they\u2019re both productive and beneficial in the end. Eventually, your mind will calm down on its own and you\u2019ll find your own solutions to these symptoms. I find that at this point the really important thing really is time. Once I felt like I was going crazy for the hundredth time, I realized that if every time before this one was a false alarm, this one (and all the ones after for that matter) are false alarms too. This stage took about 3 months to recover from, but once I did, I hit the next stage.\n\nAnxiety is 1 - 3 most days, with some days feeling almost completely anxiety free:\n\nYou\u2019re in the home stretch. This is it. You\u2019re likely already giving yourself credit for all the hard work you\u2019ve done, but you should still take a moment to recognize just how far you\u2019ve come. For me, having a day where I go out and try something new with friends while anxious is something I wouldn't have been able to do even BEFORE my anxiety disorder. Certainly not anything I\u2019d ever dreamed of while in the thick of it. Seriously, if you\u2019ve hit this point, the light should be at the end of the tunnel. And on the days where it\u2019s a little harder to deal with, let me reassure you: you\u2019re almost home free.\n\nNote: your symptoms will still be present at this point. Some of the intrusive thoughts might still come, sometimes you\u2019ll have a bit of dissociation or an occasional almost-panic attack, but you know how to deal with these things. Your moments of panic don\u2019t last more than a few seconds, and your symptoms don\u2019t really illicit a response from you. At this stage:\n\n**1.** You know what works best for you. Keep doing it. You have your techniques and you\u2019ve clearly demonstrated they work. All that\u2019s left is to keep doing them and reap the rewards you know will come. On the worse days when your anxiety peaks at a 3 or 4, remind yourself where you were several months ago and how you\u2019ll never experience anxiety that bad ever again. Then gently engage yourself in something and ride the wave of anxiety until it subsides. \n\n**2.** Slowly lose your crutches. If you discuss your anxiety with your friends, stop doing so as frequently and eventually stop altogether. If you\u2019re still occasionally taking benzos, slowly taper off. The more of your independence you get back, the more confident you\u2019ll feel.\n\n**3.** Keep exploring other areas of your life where you\u2019ve had anxiety and use what you\u2019ve learned to stop worrying. For me, this meant things like conquering my fear of heights by going snowboarding, and confronting my discomfort with physical and emotional intimacy by going out of my way to discuss these things. The more of these long-standing anxieties you\u2019re able to ease, the better you\u2019ll feel overall. Plus you get the added sense of achievement for doing things that past you would\u2019ve never been able to do.\n\nThere really isn\u2019t much left to say at this stage. I found myself being discouraged more frequently at this point just because I knew I was so close to the finish line but not quite there. In case you need any encouragement, remind yourself of how well you\u2019ve done so far and that there\u2019s more to come.\n\nThen finally\u2026\n\nNo anxiety, with the worst days peaking at a 0.5 or 1:\n\nThat\u2019s it. All the voices in your head telling you you\u2019re not good enough have gone silent. All those symptoms you used to worry so much about don\u2019t really happen anymore. You might still be a bit fatigued or foggy some days, but most of the time you\u2019re energetic, present, and can confront new challenges with a sense of confidence you\u2019ve never had. It\u2019s been a few months since you\u2019ve even given your anxiety a second thought. You know some of your symptoms might come back for a short spell every once in a while, but you\u2019re not worried about them. You know exactly what to do when that happens, and that they\u2019ll go away just as quickly as they came.\n\nI don\u2019t have any advice for this point. You know what got you here and have built up the mental fortitude to know you\u2019ll keep on doing it. \n\nCongratulations. You understand how amazing it is that you got to this point. Remember this feeling.\n_\n\nMy therapist once gave me a great rule of thumb I think sums things up really well: whatever your anxiety is telling you to do, do the opposite. If it\u2019s telling you not to get out of bed, do it. If it\u2019s telling you not to go to a social event, do that. If it\u2019s telling you you\u2019re going to suffer from some grave illness, remind yourself that\u2019s not true. If it\u2019s telling you to google your symptoms or ask for help, don\u2019t. If it\u2019s telling you you\u2019re losing your mind, remind yourself you\u2019re not. Give it enough time, and eventually things will get better. \n\n**Summary:**\n\n**Ease into your symptoms. Remember that it\u2019s just anxiety and can\u2019t do anything other than make you uncomfortable. You\u2019ve been through this a hundred times before and survived every single time.**\n\n**Don\u2019t fight it. When you fight your anxiety, it only gets worse. So let your anxiety do whatever it wants and just watch as a detached observer.**\n\n**Keep yourself occupied. The more time you spend thinking about your anxiety, googling your symptoms, posting on this subreddit, writing in your journal, or just stewing in general, the worse off you\u2019ll be. Cook, clean, dance, exercise, paint, draw, do anything you can to forcibly rip your mind off your anxiety.**\n\n**Keep pushing the bounds of what you\u2019re doing. Expose yourself to more anxiety. Exercise harder. Try things you\u2019ve never tried before. Make your anxiety flare up as much as possible because you know it\u2019ll only benefit you in the end.**\n\n**Regularly question your thoughts. Just because you think something doesn\u2019t make it true. You\u2019ll find a hundred times out of a hundred the thing you\u2019ve been dreading isn\u2019t half as horrible as your brain has made it out to be.**\n\n**Give it time. You\u2019ll find once you experience the same anxiety for the same reason for the thousandth time in a row that it becomes a bit easier to stop believing what it tells you.**\n\nThank you for reading this.

An anxiety disorder is not a permanent condition. Much like any other illness or disorder, you can take gradual steps to recover. It may not come as quickly as you want and you will encounter plenty of pitfalls. But once you start counting your victories, however small, you'll realize what a **huge** difference your efforts can make.\n\nGood luck guys :)",

I know that seems silly, but when everyone you know has one and it's such a basic part of life, it really gets to you. I was also always embarrassed to show my learner's permit when buying alcohol because I felt like the waiter/cashier was judging me for only having a permit, even though they most likely weren't.

            "selftext": "*I've been having a not-so-good day, so I read a post of mine from a couple years ago that usually helps me a little bit. This is it:*\n\nI\u2019ve been dealing with anxiety for a long time now and I\u2019ve compiled some \u2018ideas\u2019 that have helped me out in multiple occasions. I\u2019m sharing them below in hopes others can benefit from them. I\u2019ve gathered most of them from the internet, so if you know the source ( I don\u2019t), feel free to give credit! Disclaimer: non-native English speaker. Expect more than a few mistakes, ;)\n\n**Future situations are too vague.**\n\nHow can you answer a question before it\u2019s even asked? How can you solve a problem before it presents itself? Is my boss going to be mad at me or compliment me for my effort? Is he even going to say something? Is he even going to notice? Future situations are too vague, and trying to sort them out beforehand leads to frustration. That\u2019s not smart. You will have the ability to deal with them if and when they happen, if nothing else because you\u2019ll have more information about them.\n\n**Most of my worries never happen anyway.**\n\nOr \u201cin my life I\u2019ve known many problems, most of which never happened\u201d (or something like that). That\u2019s very, very true.\n\n**If you treat every situation as a life and death matter, you\u2019ll die a lot of times.**\n\nThink about one of those \u2018huge\u2019 things that bugged you years back. Most of them don\u2019t seem so \u2018life and death\u2019 now, I guess. Be smart about it and learn from experience.\n\n**We have the energy to deal with today\u2019s issues, not tomorrow\u2019s (yet).**\n\nFeeling like you must have a solution right now to all the problems you\u2019ll face in your life is, obviously, too much. Nobody has. We all have the energy to deal with this very moment. Tomorrow, we\u2019ll have the energy to deal with tomorrow\u2019s problems (if they ever come to be).\n\n**We are all in this together. Nobody has life figured out.**\n\nEven though it may seem that some people do, it\u2019s just not true. We tend to overestimate others\u2019 knowledge only because they appear more confident than us. But I assure you that even the most confident person (your father, your boss, your teacher\u2026) has tons of doubts, makes mistakes and screws up on a daily basis. They just don\u2019t overthink those doubts and mistakes. That\u2019s key to being confident. Again: we are all in this together. NOBODY has life figured out.\n\n**Reality is uncertain. We all \u2018improvise\u2019 life.**\n\nReality can surprise you in a good or a bad way. Mostly, though, it will not surprise you at all. Whatever happens, you will deal with it when it happens. We all \u2018improvise\u2019 life.\n\n**There is no bear.**\n\nOur imagination is really powerful. That\u2019s why scary movies work, right? Unfortunately, we tend to imagine things that scare us all the time. If you imagine there\u2019s a big brown bear across the room right now, your body will react to that. So, the next time you get that \u2018impending doom\u2019 feeling in your chest, just realize that your imagination is messing with you. There is no bear.\n\n**We are all one small adjustment away from making our lives work.**\n\nYou are not a thousand miles away from a happy life. You are right there, on the cusp of it. There\u2019s probably just one small adjustment needed for your life to work. Maybe it\u2019s learning to not overthink life and just take it a moment at a time. From then on, things will start to come together for you.\n\n**This too shall pass.**\n\nGood moments eventually end. Bad moments do too. No problem or bad feeling lasts forever. They just make way for whatever\u2019s next.\n\n**Life is not about waiting for the storm to pass, it\u2019s about learning to dance in the rain.**\n\nLife is not a movie! It will never be perfect, period (for ANYBODY). You are allowed to have fun and enjoy your imperfect life, your imperfect moments, even when you feel things are \u2018wrong\u2019 \u2013 that\u2019s what life is about.\n\n**We adapt.**\n\nThings in our lives change sometimes, for better or worse. Don\u2019t let the fear of change feel worse than the change itself. We are humans and adaptation is our thing. You\u2019ll adapt to it in no time.\n\n**It\u2019s not the load that breaks you, it\u2019s the way you carry it.**\n\nStop overestimating your responsibilities. You will fail more than a few times - you are not a superhero, and people know that.\n\n**It\u2019s better to shit your pants than to die of constipation.**\n\nThe fear that precedes some situations is 99% of the time worse than the situations themselves. Acknowledge this and get them over with. No matter the outcome, you\u2019ll be able to deal with it.\n\n**This is probably not an emergency.**\n\nSo, it\u2019s okay to calm yourself down. You don\u2019t have to have an answer right now. You have time.\n\n**There will come a time when you\u2019ll wonder why you were so worried about it.**\n\nIt\u2019s happened before, right? Things eventually just worked out? Yeah, it will happen again and again. Take a breath and put things in perspective.",
