I submitted something in late and I was so sure my boss was going to blow up on me that I paced around for hours at home, but he called and was very understanding. It's exhausting having to live life as a panicky mess. \n\nI was scolded once by a strict coach when I was 15 and it took me actual years to get over it.

But with anxiety being as fickle as it is, it's hard to find something that sinks into the background without being too boring or stimulating.\n\nRecently I've been wanting to put free time to better use and get over my fear of talking to people, so as a person who tends to ramble on a lot, I thought it might be a fun idea to post my rambles online for other people to (hopefully!) enjoy. The general idea was to record myself softly talking the listener through something I'm doing or find interesting, but in a way that doesn't matter too much if you zone out a bit. Like Bob Ross, but with less paint and hair. \n\nI'm really open to ideas though and if any of you folks have any ideas for specific things you would like me to talk about I'd consider doing (free!) commissions.\n\nI look forward to hearing what you think :)",

I hate feeling this way.\nPlease tell me I\u2019m not alone? Is anyone else getting this feeling? Does anyone else feel this way?  :( \n\nI got surprised with a new car for an early graduation present from my parents. I\u2019m extremely lucky to have even gotten it since we aren\u2019t rich and don\u2019t have a lot of money.. I had a job but me and my stupid stress and anxiety had to quit my first job after two whole days because I couldn\u2019t handle it.. I wanted to keep the job so badly... I failed.. \n\nAnd today I got to buy concert tickets to some of my favorite dj\u2019s and artists. I\u2019ve never been to a concert before and I\u2019m extremely excited for it. \n\nAnyways back to the point of this post.. \nDoes anyone else get nervous and extremely anxious when good things happen? I\u2019m scared now that something bad is going to happen or that something will go wrong..  :( I\u2019m really scared and I don\u2019t know why or what to do. I hate feeling like this. \n\nThank you so much if you\u2019ve read all of this. It means a lot and even helps venting about this.\n\n\n\nEDIT: I\u2019m so sorry I can\u2019t reply to all of you right now. I will be replying to as many as I can! Thank you all so much! I\u2019m just also worried that this concert I bought tickets to, will end up being 18+ even though I\u2019ve looked everywhere trying to find out. The website does say all ages but I\u2019m just really scared because every time someone I really like and want to see comes anywhere close to me, (I live in the middle of nowhere in south Texas. The closest Walmart is an hour away), it\u2019s always 18+ .. \n\nHas anyone ever heard of Breakaway Dallas? It\u2019s a music festival.. or here is the website as well - [Breakaway Music Festival](breakawaydallas.com) \nCan anyone help me out with this? It would be a huge relief or I\u2019ll be stressing out until April 7th.. \n\nThank you all again. You\u2019re amazing people here.\n\nEDIT #2 : not sure if this is even allowed here, but if anyone has twitter or Snapchat or even pm here, and doesn\u2019t mind talking to me every once and a while, it would mean the world to me. Having someone to talk to that understands helps a ton. Yet none of my friends even understand and just laugh at me.. if you can talk to me, or want to, pm me? Thanks again. You\u2019re the best. *huge group hug* ",

            "selftext": "I hope some of you can relate to this. Last night I went to a concert. There was this girl there in her 20s and she was dancing like a complete idiot. Everyone was watching. She may have been drunk, but I found myself completely jealous of her ability to just not care. I haven't danced in 10 years, and maybe never with the kind of freedom she did. I'm too afraid of seeming stupid. I'm a lanky, straight, quiet, nerdy dude but it sounds so fun to just drunkenly shake my ass and really feel the music.\n\nOver the past two years I've developed an increasingly thin tolerance for my past self. It went from randomly thinking about stupid stuff I did as a kid or teen, to ritualistically checking my facebook memories every single day so that I could delete all my old stupid pictures and statuses. You ever wake up with a hangover and realize what an idiot you were last night? I feel like that *all the time* -- even though I've stopped drinking (because anxiety). I'm also a writer and this extends to hating a lot of my work and wanting to scrap it after it's already been released.\n\nI used to be the funny guy when I was younger, but now I realize how hurtful or stupid my sense of humor was to the point where I'm not sure what's funny anymore. When I do loosen up and let loose with a joke, people seem to enjoy it quite a bit, but I later realize that what I said might have been stupid or somehow mean. So I've started keeping my mouth shut more, but now I feel I've become really hollow and boring when I talk to people. I don't think my personality comes out at all. \n\nI'm always trying to be a better person but it's gotten to the point where the only certainty I have is my ability to be wrong and the fact that my motivations behind everything are somehow flawed. I don't want to hurt anyone but I also want to feel like people know me. Right now I don't. My wife is always telling me that everyone who meets me loves me but I'm worried that they can't, because they don't know me. Or maybe I don't let them know me?\n\nAny ways to cope with this? I already read \"the subtle art of not giving a f*ck\" but I didn't find it super helpful.\n\n",

For a short, one sentence reason why I\u2019m like this- I was raised in a home where I was emotionally abused and encouraged to not try to better myself or do anything but exist.\n\nAs a result, I have a difficult time participating in any sort of activity with other people. I\u2019ve come to fully expect to fail and be horrible at anything I do, and I feel like whatever people I meet along the way secretly hate me. This always seems to happen to me when I get really into something and get excited which is almost like a grace period, but then... it just crashes.\n\nFor instance, I just got into Dungeons and Dragons. It\u2019s been.... a month or so? And I\u2019m already wanting to quit after participating in four games because I feel like my character and abilities are awful and that the people I\u2019m playing with are only doing it because they feel obligated.\n\nI\u2019m fully aware that a lot of this is in my head, but as much as I try to rationalize it, I always find myself cutting it off and choosing to participate in activities that only require me, myself, and I.\n\nI don\u2019t want to be that old person who has literally nobody in their life and nothing to live for. I want so bad to push through it, but I just.... can\u2019t?\n\nCan anyone give me some advice as to how to better manage myself with this? I want to better myself as a person.\n\nAlso, I have a job that requires me to be friendly, well speaking and everything, and my problems there are far less severe. I still feel like I suck at it, but I\u2019m sure as hell great at acting in the moment.",

He is not at the pound and no one has responded to my posting campaign on local sites.\n\nThe idea that something could have happened to him is tearing my heart to shreds. I'm a grown man who keeps having to go to the bathroom at work and try to talk myself down from having a huge breakdown. \n\nIf something has happened to him, I feel like its my fault. Like I was supposed to keep him safe. \n\nThe longest he's ever been gone is 3 days. He's never been gone this long before and I'm in such mental anguish over this.\n\nI keep having these mental flashes of him being dragged off by coyotes or something. \n\nI don't know how to handle this and I just needed somewhere to vent.\n\nEDIT: thanks everyone. Loki is still not home but you\u2019ve all given me a bit of hope.",

I have flower beds all around my house and I view my plants as my \"babies.\" But last year my emotional support cat passed away at 12 years old and I feel like my soul went with him, it was the worst pain I've ever experienced. In my grief I completely neglected my garden for the whole year. That cat was like furry Xanax to me, and now that he's gone my anxiety has been at it's worst. But today I said \"no more hiding\" and I went back outside and weeded the beds, planted some more dahlias and lilies, mulched, and trimmed my roses. I even met the new neighbor without getting nervous and going back inside. Now my beloved garden has its life back, and I feel a little bit better. Now that I have new things popping up from the ground I have no excuse to ignore them. I hope I can muster up the strength to keep going. For today, I'm proud of myself. ",

I used to live my life with constant fear for my health the constant anxiety left me with chest pain and a constant feeling of impending doom. Then I moved from the country to the middle of a town and everything has changed for the better for me. I started going to the gym daily, playing basketball, and interacting with people more. I haven\u2019t been on any medication and I don\u2019t even  think about my anxiety anymore. Don\u2019t get me wrong every once in a while it is there for minutes at a time but limiting my caffeine to the morning and making sure I eat when I drink coffee combined with the daily exercise has done wonders for me. I know this isn\u2019t exactly new information for many of you but I want everyone to know that it can and will get better! You are stronger than your anxiety! ",
