Even though if they never show any anger towards me or mention it again, I always end up convincing myself that they hate me now because of what I did. For example, showing up late or leaving an event early without saying goodbye, or forgetting something like a birthday. Even if they act totally fine and forgiving, I just can't shake the feeling that deep down they don't like me anymore. And even thinking about the situation again triggers the start of a panic attack. I know there is nothing I can do in retrospect and over-apologizing can just make things even worse. I guess I just over analyze everything that I do wrong and have some insecurities in my friendships. Anyone else feel this was sometimes?",

            "selftext": "Hello r/anxiety: long time lurker, first time poster. Really struggling so any advice is welcome.   \nThis may seem odd, but there's something that's been bothering me for a few months now. I'm in my early 20s and only recently started dating. The first time I spent the night with a guy I became very self conscious when it came to cuddling and trying to fall asleep. I became very self aware. My every movement and every breath was suddenly very noticeable to me. At one point I swallowed and my swallow just seemed so loud - kind of like a mini gulp. Anyway, after I did that I couldn't stop thinking about swallowing, which resulted in me continuously having the urge to swallow. I know how strange this sounds, but please don't judge.   \n\n\nNow every time I spend the night with a guy I worry about this happening. I feel like my swallows are very audible. Especially because it's an anxiety induced swallow. Natural swallowing isn't as loud, but if you're swallowing because you're hyper focused on it, then A) you swallow more frequently, and B) the swallows become more audible since they are, in a way, forced swallows. I feel really ridiculous typing this, but please understand that this is an actual issue for me. I no longer want to date, and if I meet someone I'm genuinely interested in I start to get sad because I think nothing can ever come of it since I'll be so anxious when we share a bed.   \n\n\nThis isn't as bad during the day if said guy and I are watching tv or something because the sound of the TV will tune out my swallowing, and also because I'm more easily distracted. For example, the task at hand (like the show we're watching or our conversations) will distract me from my constant swallowing. However, when you're just lying there next to someone trying to sleep there's nothing there that can serve as a distraction or tune you out...I dated this one guy for a month, and we shared a bed a total of 8-10 times, and I couldn't fall asleep AT ALL any of those nights. Even when he was asleep I was still so tightly wound from my anxiety that I couldn't shut my mind off. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI think the best solution would be acceptance - like so what if I swallow, if he's a good guy he wont judge me, etc. However I can't seem to convince myself! I know for a fact that my swallowing is audible, and is frequent. And every time I'm lying next to a guy and I swallow, my heart starts to race. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI've struggled with OCD in the past (Pure O) and I wouldn't be surprised if this was just a form of that. Regardless, that doesn't really help me solve my problem. I just want to know if anyone else has ever had this problem, and how they dealt with it. Just knowing I'm not alone would really help me.   \n\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

Or which should i try first before going on to the more serious ones. He gave me Sulpiride (Dogmatil) which works quite differently than most antipsychotics, as it only works on dopamine receptors and doesnt touch serotonin. Should i give this a try first? I dont see it mentioned online much or it being popularly used which scares me away from it. However he also suggested Zyprexa, Abilify, Seroquel, Risperidal...what should i do here?",

I was dealing with hyperventilation since I was even younger than 7 again coz when I was young my parents used to lock me in dark so I remember those moments when I was panicking and crying in dark.  When I first started to go to school in (grade one) hyperventilation stopped and I didn't get it till I stopped going to school coz of some problems so I didn't get hyperventilation for 7 years coz I studied till grade 7.  I don't even know how I'm still typing this I'm dealing with anxiety now :/ so I remember when I got anxiety attack or something it was 7am and I was laying in bed watching movies I started to feel like I make noises when I breath that made me breath fast I went outside and that made it worse I remember falling down and saying I'm dying I was 15 I don't know how I made it to home I woke up my mom she took me to hospital this time they checked my blood, heart etc and said my problem was stress that kept happening till this day now I live alone and I wake up to focus on my breath I really need help I tried to kill myself I went to hospital more than 8 times and same thing I'm always OK when I'm asleep I wake up to hyperventilate now I'm all the time dizzy and with headache and feeling light headed i don't know if I spilled that right etc I don't know what to do in my life anymore I lost my best friend,  mom, grandmother before 3 months and my dad moved to the UK we talk once a month I can't go outside even going to supermarket  makes panic and hyperventilate the moment I'm far away from home I enter the panic mode I can't play soccer coz I always end up hyperventilating but I noticed that after I play soccer or do sports I breath OK and it relives my anxiety but I still have a bad chronic hyperventilation please don't say I have asthma or heart problem or any s*** every damn test said I was okay the doctor told me my heart is like a horse heart or something I don't have friends or anything I'm alone and always at home what did I do to deserve this? I live on a big building and I'm on the 10th floor and i always use the stairs coz I fear elevators I can't calm down what's wrong with me :/ I get weird feelings like I'm outside of my body and weird anxiety when I'm about to fall asleep I don't wanna end up in a mental institution what should I do? Is there a way to stop worrying about my breathing?  Sometimes I' stop breathing sometimes I'm. Breathing fast :/ I just wanna sleep all the time so that I never hyperventilate it's annoying and sorry for complaining here :/ I need to see a psychologist but I keep saying I'll never get treated I can't even concentrate on anything anymore how I'm gonna get a job? I don't know. Can someone tell me anything like anything or cheer me up I'm sick of going to the er. Again sorry and thanks and please don't be mean on the comments Ignore this if you've nothing good to say and thanks (@xuc.v) my instagram anyone can dm me and thanks (:",

Just a random person.  \n\n\nSo I've had anxiety for more than half of my almost 37 years.  \nI won't go into the details, but I consider it pretty bad. I've lost jobs, can barely make a phone call, etc. I consider it to be the absolute worst thing in my life. I'd do just about anything to take it away.  \n\n\nBut is anxiety a luxury? An easy excuse? A modern thing?  \nLook, I know my life isn't terrible. I have a two awesome children, a decent job, food, shelter, safety, freedoms, etc. I don't fear for my life on a regular basis, I've never had to worry about feeding my children or finding water. And I am thankful for and appreciate it. \n\nI can't imagine the countless millions, billions even, throughout history or even now, letting anxiety have such an impact on their lives. They would probably trade their hunger pains for my anxiety all day.  \n\n\nAnd despite knowing that I have it pretty good, I still freak the hell out over some pretty pathetic things.  \n\n\nPlease, forgive this post. I know that it's not that simple. And I'm sure I missed other things. It's just something I thought about earlier. And I'm not down playing anyone or what they feel.  \n",

            "selftext": "We aren't dating.  I don't think.  It's complicated but here's a basic back story for context (feel free to ask if more clarification is needed). \n\nIt all started just about a year ago.  I was really starting to like him. In my mind we were just friends, but it really seemed like it had the potential to be more than that.  I wasn't ready for committing to a real relationship and my self hate made me feel like it wasn't fair to him anyway because I suck and he's amazing.  I'd had anxiety for as long as I could remember, as well as other undiagnosed mental health issues (BPD, ADD, depression). He cared for me and gave me attention at a time in my life that I really needed it, and it scared me to need someone that much.  It scared me to wonder if he really cared about me or if it was all in my head. Eventually I couldn't ignore the severe panic attacks any more, so in the middle of an anxiety attack I sent him a bunch of confusing messages and we met up.  It was terrible.  I felt trapped sitting in his truck talking to him.  I felt like I'd trapped him by demanding answers to questions I didn't even understand myself.  To be honest, I dissociated and I really don't remember much of that day except that it was terrible and I don't want to experience that ever again, and I feel terrible that he saw me that way.  \n\nWe've seen each other since then.  We've had our ups and downs.  I finally got into therapy and got my diagnoses.  I'm doing better. But every once in a while I still freeze and it's like my mind shuts down and all I'm aware of is a tension, and I'm afraid. It's like there's a wall I'm hiding behind but it's pressing me and I'm trapped.  Sometimes I'm not even sure why I feel that way.  Taking deep breaths and grounding myself helps sometimes.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm anxious that I'll get afraid when I'm with him and be really boring company.  I want to be someone who deserves all the patience and kindness he's given me.  I've run to him and run away from him more times then he even knows. I'm scared I'll mess it up.  I'm scared and I suppose I'm hoping that maybe someone could empathize and give me some advice? ",

After being out of school for three years due to a bunch of mental problems making me a full-time psychiatric patient, I (19) am finally considered stable enough to take some courses at an upper secondary school for people who are in psychiatric treatment. So far, so good. \n\nIn English (my third language) class we are supposed to write a persuasive essay, and I find myself absolutely unable to do it. There is no topic I have such detailed knowledge about that I can rightfully argue for a certain point of view. (Or, there are, but they're unsuitable for school.) I've read the resources, thought about it so much that I can't focus on reading, tried to just scribble down ideas...and get stuck. I will just sit at my desk digging my nails into it, writhe, feel my heartbeat go up, and just freeze. Then sit there for 15-30 min doing absolutely nothing before I get up, try to clear my mind and get a fresh start. It doesn't work.\n\nI can't do this.  Gone so far as wasting time on writing a letter of apology now; wasting because I won't dare to hand it in, convinced it will only be seen as some lazy excuse for not bothering to do homework. It is frustrating, because I really enjoy English class in general, but completely lack the confidence/authority and rhetoric skills to justify writing something like that. I think it also plays a role that I do not at all like the idea of revealing an opinion (a part of myself; exposing myself, scared of being vulnerable) to a stranger just like that. \n\nIt ha gone so far as that I skipped all English lessons last week. My \"excuse\"; both times I had become so nervous an guilt-ridden the night before that I punished myself and had to go to the A&amp;E instead of school resp. lost consciousness. Yes, that makes me ashamed, and I can't exactly tell school that's why I didn't attend. Tomorrow there is English again. I wish I was able to get that essay done. I \"want\" to punish myself again, but it is reasonable to assumd that it would go too far tonight. Feel like I'll never be able to make it into that classroom again (And not to school, because I am terrified of getting confronted with my laziness)\n\nSorry. What an incredibly petty problem.",

I was lying on my bed, and suddenly I felt something really bad was happening, and I was shaking on my bed for like an hour without knowing what to do. Things like these have been happening for more than a year (I think I've had it four or five times). I ended the \u201cattack\u201d by breathing calmly and talking to people. \n\nWhen they happen, one of my greatest fears show up. I feel like all the reality is a dream, and I'm actually in a catatonic state. Stupid right? But it\u2019s what I feel. \n\nI tried LSD once. Yeah, stupid me. I had a very, very bad trip that left me with fear for some weeks. And I'm afraid that, that experience has gotten worse my attacks. \n\nI talked with my parents today (I'm 20, I live with them) about it. It was very hard for me because I never tell them about my problems or personal life. I'm a very quiet person about those things. I told them everything (except about the LSD, I don\u2019t want them to think that I'm a junkie. I don\u2019t do drugs. I had my moments with weed in high school and that\u2019s it), and told them that I would like to see a psychologist. I'm moving next year to another part in the country to study and I would like to go there without anything bad on my mind.\n\nThey got pretty scared. I'm an only child and they are very protective with me. But yes, I'm going to see a psychologist.\n\nSometimes I think I'm becoming crazy, but crazy people never notice that, so I don\u2019t mind about it any more.\n\n\nWell, that\u2019s it. That\u2019s my story.",

            "selftext": "I want to share with you all what I've used to essentially \"cure\" all my anxiety problems. The idea of a \"cure\" is a bit of a misnomer because of my ideology about mental health. In essence, the problem has always been about my *relationship* to the things in my head, not the experiences themselves. For roughly 5 years, I experienced severe anxiety, and was diagnosed with a multitude of things including OCD, unspecified psychosis, and generalized anxiety disorder. I still experience anxiety, however it's the same thing as experiencing sweat. Previously, I was like a gym newbie that was obsessed with never sweating and never feeling tension. Everything made me sweat, everything made me anxious, and there were particular things that I felt very sweaty / anxious about. Those stairs? Never in a million years. Those thoughts of religious scrupulosity? Not even a possibility. Generally, I avoided sweating and there were some things I was so dead-set about not sweating over, I became particularly easy at sweating about, and would sweat profusely about.\n\nMental health is all about the sweat-inducing tension of pushing into difficult experiences. What most people are concerned about in mental health is symptom reduction. That is the problem. If you told someone that you didn't want to sweat or feel discomfort anymore so you weren't going to the gym, they'd probably look at you funny. For physical health, it's intuitive and easily understood that in order to get stronger, it's inevitable that you will have to feel tension and push yourself even when your brain is telling you \"No, I'm uncomfortable, let's stop.\" It's the same way with mental health. \n\nThe main difference between the two, mental and physical health, is that we aren't being chased by velociraptors every day. Physical demands aren't placed on us like mental and emotional ones are, and without the proper training, knowledge, and skill it can become very easy to wrap yourself up in compulsions and beliefs about why you shouldn't feel or think x, y, or z. In the same way that a malnourished population chased by dinosaurs might try to avoid \"sweaty, heart-poundy syndrome,\" due to their inability to support their own growth, we as a society tend to avoid a different kind of sweaty, heart poundy syndrome because we lack the tools, experience, and knowledge to grow from it.\n\nIf you are interested in how to build up your mental health muscles, I recommend you pick up Mark Freeman's book \"You are not a rock,\" in the US or \"The Mind Workout\" in EU and elsewhere. Practicing mental health sounds complicated, something that requires medication, or something that's only for people who've been labeled with a mental illness. The book outlines the fundamentals of mental health and the common, everyday normal things we do that lead to mental illness. A brief overview:\n\n* You are not a rock. Rocks will always be better than you at not doing thing, not feeling things, and not thinking things. A rock will always be better than you at this and trying to be like a rock will only lead you in circles. Instead, mental health practice should be centered around what you can do instead of what you're trying to get rid of. Build yourself up instead of trying to tear the things inside you down. Learning how to be human instead of a rock means identifying your *values,* the things that you care about and are the center of your self expression. This can manifest inwardly or outwardly. You might decide to value appreciating everything around you, just for the sake of appreciating it, or practicing lovingkindness. You might value giving people things, physical or mental (ie: your attention and consideration). You might value making healthy meals for yourself, regardless of how much your brain screams for pizza and soda.\n\n* Mental fitness is the same thing as physical fitness. In order to stick with a mental or physical fitness plan, you need to make systematic changes to the way that you live your life that are intuitive and easy to sustain in the long term. Most people fall out of the beginning stages of habit with a physical fitness plan because they put a lot of stress on their bodies and minds that they don't believe they can keep doing consistently. Change is stressful and difficult, so we need supports in order to make habits that last. We need to eat well, sleep well, and practice things in our waking life that support these changes.\n\n* Everything we do is a practice. If you aren't in a coma, you are practicing something in your daily life, and you are getting better and better at it. If you practice doing nothing or compulsively reacting to desires to feel one way or another, you will become extremely good at it. Likewise, if you add in practices that are centered around your values and you continue to practice them, you will become better and better at them until they become as easy as where you're at now. The reason why what you're doing now is so easy is because you've been doing it for so long. Being stuck in a rut for a long time isn't a death sentence, it's just a matter of intelligently making systematic change that makes sense for your mind and body to do.\n\n* Mental health is about being yourself. When someone ends up with a mental illness diagnosis, it means that their life has been hijacked by patterns of reacting to judgments and beliefs. The natural result of reacting to judgments and beliefs are compulsions. Compulsions are cyclical desires to feel one way or another way, or be free of a certain feeling. The pattern of being yourself, and subsequently the pattern of mental health, is acting in accordance with what you value instead of reacting to the things that pop up in your head. Instead of saying you don't even want to go to this party, you don't like or know anyone there, or that you'll probably have a bad time you decide to act in accordance with the value of attending social events and expressing yourself. The focus is on putting yourself and your values out into the world instead of trying to control what you feel or don't feel. Maybe the party will suck and you won't have fun, but it's an uncertainty you have to accept in order to have great mental health.\n\n* Normal is what got you here. Many people want to go back to the way things \"used to be,\" when they didn't struggle with mental health problems. Some people don't have a \"used to be\" and their experience of building up mental health will be a first time experience. In the same way that a 20 year old might be able to down a keg of beer and gulp an extra large pizza without gaining any weight, but a 50 year old would, our mental health is subject to a variety of conditions which create different results. You may not be in the same conditions you were when you were younger that made it \"okay\" to do compulsions and still feel relatively comfortable. \"Normal\" is just the waiting room for a mental illness diagnosis. You can keep chugging beers and pizza, but if you continue that practice it will have consequences for your health in the long term, even if you don't experience them at this very moment.\n\nThank you for reading! I'm incredibly appreciative of the opportunity to share this knowledge and these experiences. If you are interested in buying Mark's book, you can find it in bookstores or on amazon.
