            "selftext": "I live in North Carolina.  I went to college, initially, for political science and economics, but about 3/4 of the way through that switched to education and biology because my gut told me to GTFO.\n\nIn high school, I took AP history and AP government and politics and fell in love with America's founding principles, the political system's design (and intent), and being able to have spirited, informative debates with my peers.  I was at Barack Obama's inauguration with my AP G&amp;P class, and it was wonderful.  One of the most amazing things I've ever witnessed.\n\nBut here's the thing...  I was ultra, ridiculously, lick-Ann-Coulter's-asshole conservative during that time.  I had grown up in a trite Republican household in the rural south with traditional right-wing values and a lot of Jesus.  My grandparents are also very conservative.  Fox News was *always* on.\n\nThings quickly began changing when I moved to Raleigh for college.  More racial and religious diversity, time away from Fox News, I discovered Reddit...  And then some personal things happened, as well.  I started having mood swings regularly, I had my first panic attack, I developed epilepsy, I was frequently in the hospital, I had no money...  I got pregnant and had an abortion.\n\nAll of this was very eye-opening.  I learned sympathy and empathy really quickly.  It was easy to be politically conservative when I was pretty much totally ignorant to the realities that most people face every day.  But going through all of that changed my view completely.  Suddenly, I saw why people needed government assistance for food, healthcare, transportation, and housing.  I understood why a woman should be free to make a choice about having an abortion (if that pregnancy didn't kill me due to my epilepsy, the child would have had major defects due to the medications I was on at the time).\n\nNOW, though...  Look at what is going on in the US.  Every time I think shit has hit the fan, someone reaches into the shit-bucket again.  It makes me so anxious.  My healthcare is going to be fucked with, I wouldn't be surprised if ADA got dismantled, women's rights are being stripped away...  Not to mention how racial minorities are being fucked.  I might be getting screwed for being a woman, but at least I'm white...\n\nMy parents, especially my father, love *all of this.*  I've been spending a lot of time with them following my hospitalization earlier this year from February-April.  Every time I'm there, if the TV is on, it's on Fox News.  If my dad's around, he won't shut up about how *wonderful* Trump is (without giving any real reasons), he says insanely racist things, talks about how people with disabilities are just exaggerating, etc.  It makes me pissed initially, but then I just become anxious because it's so upsetting to see and hear.  Does he think *I'm* faking it, with my multiple suicide attempts and scar-covered body???\n\nHe's even got a signed picture of Trump and Melania up on the refrigerator from during the campaign when he donated to them.  Even if I was still conservative, I would've taken that shit down early last year--and, in retrospect, things were mild at that time.\n\nHe asks for my opinions, more than likely, to try to confirm how he feels.  He'll loudly commentate on whatever story Fox has on at the time, blame a minority or liberal for something, then ask what I think.  If I didn't have the political background that I do, I would not know WHAT to say.  However, I know how to play along to shut him up sooner, and that's what I do.  It's never what I believe, though, and it's such a sad situation.  I can't even be honest with him or he might just tell me to leave.\n\n**TL;DR:  American politics is currently fucked, and it's really freaking me out.  My Dad *loves* Trump and watches Fox News constantly, even when I'm visiting, and gets all up in my bubble with his ideology whilst not knowing that I vehemently disagree with almost everything he says.**",

            "selftext": "I've had anxiety ever since I can remember. The past couple years it's gotten to a point where it was getting so bad that I was developing depression, ruining relationships with friends and family, not leaving my apartment, etc. It was causing a lot of strain on my relationship as well. So after years of saying I'd go see someone.. I finally started seeing someone about a month ago.\n\nLast week she wanted to do a Brainspotting session with me to see what kinds of mid-brain emotions and feelings we could uncover and release. And see how my anxiety manifests, and where, as we learn to identify my thoughts and find potential triggers.\n\nIt was intense. I remember when she first explained it to me, I was skeptical. I didn't understand how that could possibly do me any good or even get a reaction. But it did.\n\nWe did that for my entire session. I thought about memories I had long forgotten about. Felt my arms get painfully hot, then go numb. My temple throbbed where I get migraines. I cried - a lot. I found it hard to swallow and breathe.\n\nAnd then with I'd say about 10 minutes left, I felt relief. Not just from those things, but actual mental relief. I felt it leave through my fingertips. I smiled. I still was having thoughts of these people and events, but then went from being negative and hopeless to appreciative and grateful. \n\nMy anxiety over the weekend was basically non-existant. I actaully made an effort to see friends. I felt energy. I felt like a literal weight was lifted off of my shoulders.\n\nI'm not sure anyone else has done this yet, or what their experience has been with it. But I'm interested to hear if you have. And I know it's a fairly new practice, but it's one I'm excited to explore further to see what else can be uncovered and hopefully let go of. ",

If I exercise or meditate I\u2019m ok, but I had to be at work early and woke up later than I wanted. \n\nSo on my way to work I had a panic attack and it continued once I arrived. Had to go out to the parking lot for a while. \n\nI also gotta mention that my work isn\u2019t stressful. I\u2019m an infant teacher at a daycare and I love it. I\u2019ve had anxiety most of my life and it\u2019s been bad lately. Also, there were no kids that day because it was a \u201cstaff day.\u201d So, no work related stress to set me off. I have been concerned about finances lately so that might have done it.\n\nMy coworkers were amazing. They let me go to the parking lot to calm down and when I went back into the building one of them gave me a hug and let me cry.  Both of my bosses, the Director and Assistant Director, were great too. I\u2019ve been trying to find a therapist that works with my schedule, and sometimes it\u2019s hard to change schedules or leave early because you have to maintain teacher ratios. They assured me that they would work with me. \n\nI know I am lucky to work at a place with so many understanding people. It wasn\u2019t easy and a little embarrassing to cry about a panic attack to my boss but I feel that talking about my mental health issues without shame is important. I have a health issue, just like diabetes or any other chronic illness, and I shouldn\u2019t be ashamed. \n\nI hope you guys have at least one person at your job or school who will hug you after a panic attack and let you cry and ask if you need water. Know that you are not alone and I feel the pain of being at the will of fear and terror and not having control over it sometimes. I\u2019m getting help and I hope you will too. ",

I used to bite my nails so bad that the meaty part of the nail was exposed and for the next few days I had to deal with the painful throbbing sore in my fingers.

And that's not the case. Anxiety is ruining my life. I need help which I'm now thankfully getting.\n\nI'm not trying to say that everyone here is abnormal. Everyone will feel how they feel and you should have control over that. I'm just saying that, personally, I don't want to be told that *this* is normal. I want to learn how to cope with anxiety and have that be my 'normal'. \n\nAnyone else?",

I have no fucking clue how i'm supposed to be an actual person in the future, and I need to ask for help with such issues in my life, but it's so hard as I don't have a good home life. I can't do this on my own, and while I do often confide in my girlfriend, it's so hard to be alive. Thank you, I hope you all have a good night.",

            "selftext": "Hello everyone, I wanted to share my anxiety story with you, its probably gonna be a long post so bare with me.\n\nIt all started around 6 - 7 months ago, as I woke up, got ready to work, starting to feel weird, I just ignored it, as I walked down the stairs, I felt like I have to go to the bathroom like RIGHT NOW, started vomiting, diarrheas, felt like I'm dying any moment now, and all I could think is how I'm going to spend my the rest of my life in a psych ward, thought I'm going insane.\n\nFrom that very moment, my anxiety was over the roof, consistently, 24/7, if I had to describe it by a scale of 1 to 10, it would be 50, just feels like crap, and something awful is about to happen any moment, was stuck in my bed, with 0 motivation to do anything, just a constant state of anxiety and fear from the moment I woke up to the moment I went to sleep, sometimes having nightmares, and all of a sudden more and more fears are forming, fear of the future, fear of dying, fear of losing my mom, fear of aging, fear or relationships, fear of literally EVERYTHING.\n\nAt some point I even started having an existential crisis, asking myself whats the purpose, why are we here, I assume its called being suicidal? not too sure tho.\n\nFor the next two weeks, I threw up EVERYTHING I ate nor drank, even water, I visit the nurse a few times to get fluids by IV since my body was collapsing and I already lost 10 (hard gained) kilos.\n\nMy doctor sent me to a Psychiatrist, he claimed its Panic Disorder and let me off with Clonex and Cipralex.\n\nGot home eager to finally be in treatment and put it all behind me, I took the Clonex and absolutley nothing happend, maybe a bit tired and anxiety is still through the roof, and then I took the Cipralex but my body rejected it every time, I threw it up every time, managed to keep it inside a few times but it just worsen every symptom I had, by the fifth day I stopped taking them because I couldn't take it no longer.\n\nI've found a book named Hope and Help for you nerves by Claire Weekes, which helped tremendously with the physical symptoms and gave me a nice outlook as for whats going on, but it was no cure whatsoever, even though I'd recommend it for anyone suffering from anxiety.\n\nSo after a month or so, all of a sudden my mental state started improving quite a bit, started to feel less and less nausea, my appetite gradually built itself back up, started gaining my weight back up, and went on a vacation abroad with a  cruise ship with my mom, at that point I felt like \"I'm finally over it\", or so I thought, around a week after coming back, it all started happening again, at this point I felt really hopeless, why is this nightmare happening again? thought i'm over with that crap, I also started suspecting i'm bipolar, which raised my anxiety even further.\n\nA month later, being in the same state, I played WoW, and there was this argument over drugs in the global chat, and one of the sides claimed shes a psychiatrist, so I sent her a message, I asked quite a few questions and she was kind enough to answer them, but theres this one thing she told me that got me thinking, I claimed that the panic attack was random, out of the blue, yet she explained that a panic attack MUST have a source, could be a dream, a thought, doesn't matter what, but there has to be a source, some sort of stimuli.\n\nSo I started thinking, there has to be something in common that I did the first time it happend, and after I came back from the vacation, and there it was, a course of antibiotics, even though my doctor said antibiotics can not cause any of this, I googled \"Doxycycline anxity\" or \"Doxycycline depression\" and I was left speechless, HUNDREDS of people experienced the exact same thing as I did, further investigation explained that in our gut we have this delicate balance of good and bad bacteria, and antibiotics acts just like chemo, it erases EVERYTHING, both good and bad bacteria, when our gut leaves this state of balance, it causes havoc both on our body and our mind, its medical term is Dysbiosis, which means unbalanced gut microbiome, sometimes balance isn't restored by itself unless you step in. so people might suffer  for years before getting better.\n\nSo I decided I'd give this a shot, I started making changes in my diet, I took off all sugar from my diet since bad bacteria feeds on it, I started eating prebiotic food such as fermented vegetables, started taking probiotics, in short, started introducing my gut healthy bacteria, thus reversing the devestating effects that the antibiotics caused.\n\nAt first my symptoms  worsened a bit, since I made changes to the balance in my gut again, but after that, it all slowly started to fade, my fears started to have less and less grip on me, my appetite started growing back again, my mental clarity as opposed to the constant fatige state I was in, no more fears, no more anxiety, no more stress over nonsense, just back to being myself again, kinda hard to believe a simple antibiotic caused all of this suffering.\n\nI learned from my experience that anxiety is often our body telling us something is wrong, something is unbalanced, but it can not use words to pin points the problem so you gotta keep looking till you find whats causing this.\n\nAt the end I can say theres a side of me that is happy it happend, I had the opportunity to learn a lot about our brains, the anatomy behind it, the amygdala, the hippocampus, its relationship, whats incharge of what, etc.\n\nI also learned that our gut has a huge role on our mood, and what we eat can contribute A LOT to anxiety and might even be the cause.\n\nWish you all best of luck and quick recovery.",

            "selftext": "Does anyone else have really intense, prevalent anxiety over their parents dying? Whenever they\u2019re even slightly ill, even if it\u2019s just with a cold, I get so panicky and worried. Even just thinking about them dying can make me cry. It\u2019s got to the point when whenever I do see my parents or speak to them on the phone I have to tell them I love them before they go because I feel like if I don\u2019t they might get in an accident or something and die and they won\u2019t have known I love them. It\u2019s become almost obsessive to the point where I get really upset and can\u2019t focus if I don\u2019t leave on good terms with them or something. I used to always worry about them dying but never to this extent. It\u2019s become my biggest fear and I know it will happen at some point but I just can\u2019t bare the thought of them getting seriously ill or something happening. I think part of it stems from the strong attachment I have to them, especially to my mum, where she is who I look to for guidance, love and support in all situations and I honestly don\u2019t know how I would cope without her. She\u2019s there for me with all my mental health problems and atm I don\u2019t feel like I could do any of what I\u2019m doing if I didn\u2019t have her. Also I feel guilty for how ungrateful I may have been when I was young towards them and so worry that they\u2019ll die without me ever being able to make amends for that. And as i still live at home i also don\u2019t know what I\u2019d do financially without them either. Mostly though I\u2019m curious to know if anyone else struggles with anxiety over their parents/someone close to them dying? and if anyone has any ideas on how to decrease this and learn to just accept things as they are.

I've been on 100mg of zoloft for a month now.\nOverwatch is one of my favorite games and I've been trying to level up on comp and, the only realistic way is to use my mic and be strategic and grouped up. And I've always been too scared to talk to people but today I used it and I feel proud of myself. Even if it was just one match. It wasn't as scary as I thought it would be. And with the new update and endorsements I feel like it pushes people to be less toxic and more positive. \nIt also might be the zoloft making me less anxious? I don't know, but I'm going to keep pushing myself to talk with people. I need to get out of gold haha.\nSorry for the format I'm on my phone",
