I CAN\u2019T force myself to be happy and nice. I am disappointed. This accelerates the anxiety frequency and I can\u2019t control it. \n\nwhat triggered today's anxiety are my friends. I feel like my friends are not supporting, I\u2019m the giver. I don\u2019t feel like they see me the way I see them. They have weekend friends and I\u2019m not one of them. There is a clear separation between their friends and me. The problem is not me or my capacity to ask to join their group it\u2019s this weird culture they have which is not join groups of friends but compartmentalizing them. This makes me mad, Some times I get so upset that I feel like abandoning my friends all together. I just want this time to pass, Because I\u2019ve been through this for almost 10 years I feel like this is permanent and I\u2019m never going to feel happiness &amp; joy. I\u2019ve basically been numb for 10 years. The only thing I feel is sadness all the time, everyday. No breaks.",

I went through one for the first time when I was 16 and I was shaking the entire time. I stuttered the whole time I ordered and felt like crying afterwards. I refused to go through one again and avoided them completely until yesterday, because it was where my friends wanted to eat and customers aren\u2019t allowed inside. I was a bit nervous but I was surprisingly fine. There was no shaking. No stuttering. No wanting to cry. I feel like I could go through another no problem. I know this probably seems stupid but I was really proud of myself, and I feel like that was a big step forward in regards to my social anxiety :)",

It's not like I can stop them but I just feel bad. I mean, few months before- I was one of the people who'd get anxious and discouraged, I would end up deleting my post/comment if I saw a downvote. I don't mind it anymore but I've been seeing those who get downvoted delete their post/comments as well. I wish I could tell them to ignore it. It doesn't matter if you get upvoted or downvoted. You'll be heard either way. There'll be people agreeing with you, being able to relate with you. Don't mind the ones who are not on your side.

            "selftext": "I've always loved dogs and have wanted one for years. Back in February, my boyfriend and I moved into an apartment that allows dogs, and last month we finally got our 7 week old puppy! \n\nI moved across the country to live with my boyfriend about a year ago and have made zero friends because of my anxiety. But one of the most important thing about raising a puppy is socialization! That means meeting 100 new people in two months and as many dogs and puppies as possible... yikes. \n\nI live in a super dog friendly apartment complex, and several of my coworkers have dogs. Introducing myself to my neighbors has always been a no-go, and making plans with my coworkers outside work sounded impossible. But now, thanks to my new puppy who I love very much and whose healthy development trumps my anxiety, I've met so many of my neighbors and have made plans with coworkers and acquaintances for puppy play dates!! It's a small step but it's a huge start. \n\nNot only is my puppy a great motivator for meeting people and making plans, he's a great ice breaker! And not even an awkward one.

            "selftext": "So for a long while, I\u2019ve struggled with relationships, particularly those of a sexual nature. I\u2019ve also been bad at meeting new people and generally I will stay away from situations that are outside of my comfort zone. I\u2019m a very solitary person, I don\u2019t go to parties, I don\u2019t see friends often and I mostly just stay home and do solitary things. \n\nI have a friend who I\u2019ve known since I was a child, yet we drifted apart a couple years back and have started talking to each other again only recently. Anyway, yesterday evening he invited me out with his mates, most of them went to school with me but I didn\u2019t really know them well. I\u2019ve been feeling unusually rebellious recently and decided to go out with them despite how nervous I felt. I was mostly anxious because they were all guys and I didn\u2019t know if we\u2019d get along so well. \n\nWe drove down to our local lakes in my friends tiny old car (that vaguely smells of weed). We went on a pretty long walk. A few of them smoked a cigarette each, which would usually make me feel anxious but I actually dealt with it okay. They\u2019re all social smokers and I suppose I judge that less now than I did. During the walk we climbed up a pretty steep ledge, I would usually be terrified of falling but I felt spurred on by everyone around me doing the same. \n\nLater in the night we even went over to one of the guy\u2019s houses. I felt kinda weird and unwelcome at first but I eventually became comfortable. Then by a stroke of luck, my Dad texted me saying he\u2019d be staying over his gf\u2019s that night, so I invited them all back to my house. Also pretty nerve wracking, but it was great, I made them pancakes and we all just had a chill time. \n\nThroughout this whole night, I was chatting/flirting with one guy in the group who I\u2019d only met once, and despite how different we were as people we still hit it off. Let\u2019s call him \u2018J\u2019. \n\nSo for a long while, I\u2019ve been pretty insecure and in the past I would date guys I wasn\u2019t so attracted to because I thought they were my only option. I\u2019ve eventually become comfortable with the idea that I\u2019m not \u2018stuck up\u2019 for wanting to date an attractive guy, I\u2019m allowed to raise my standards and I can afford to. \n\nAny way, J is probably the hottest guy I\u2019ve ever had interested in me. The guy was model levels of attractive. I was apprehensive to his flirting at first but I couldn\u2019t help but flirt back as the night went on. He stayed behind after the others left and we ended up having sex. I was jittery with nerves as I asked him to come upstairs with me but I kept my cool.\n\nI\u2019ve never hooked up with someone outside of a relationship, and I never thought I\u2019d like it, but I really did. It was just so casual and not so anxious like my other sexual experiences. By no means was it perfect, but we figured stuff out together. It\u2019s hard to really get into it when you\u2019re both pretty tired, but it was still amazing regardless. He told me how pretty/hot/etc I was and hearing that from someone I found so attractive really hit different. I\u2019m always trying to be \u2018more\u2019 than I am and to feel so appreciated as what I am right now was great. \n\nI\u2019m fucking exhausted from how late the two of us stayed up, but I\u2019ve never been more thankful to have stepped out of my comfort zone. I just had a great time and I feel so comfortable in who I am. I feel so attractive too. \n\nI was bullied in school and I\u2019ve often been teased for being too straight laced. I don\u2019t drink much, do drugs or smoke at all. I always felt like a \u2018loser\u2019. But last night I really owned who I was and I was still appreciated. \n\nI\u2019m kinda cool just the way I am. For once, I really feel like I don\u2019t have to be someone else. And you know what? That means a whole lot me.",

            "selftext": "I do hope this fits the sub and the flair, if not please let me know!\n\nI've been struggling with social and general anxiety as well as overthinking for a while now and some weeks ago, I finally got regular appointments again after I stopped therapy for a few months due to the lack of harmony and trust between my therapist and I.\nMost strategies and ideas for reducing the severity of my anxiety are long-time things that mostly still leave me with some doubts, feelings of uncomfort, ... but in my last session, my therapist told me something that helped me out a lot so far. I've been in a somewhat rough and sensitive spot lately, taking a lot of things personal and questioning my own behavior as well as other people's opinions of me.\n\nBasically, it's about trying not to interpret actions or things that might get you upset. Of course, some people do things intentionally to make others feel bad, guilty, or whatever but the issues I was facing were mostly just me overthinking - thinking why did he do that, why was she so distant, why didn't they respond when I asked something?\n\nLike my therapist explained, it's like a dog wagging its tail and knocking over a flower pot. It didn't mean to make you upset by knocking the thing over, you might call it a collateral damage. It's just a dog wagging its tail with no bad intentions whatsoever, it's just what it does. Maybe she was distant towards me because of the bad thing that happened a few minutes ago that got to her, not because she was annoyed by me starting to talk to her. Maybe they didn't respond because they weren't paying attention, were focusing on something else, and not because they wanted me to feel ignored and left out.\n\nOf course, I'm still extremely anxious, I still think a lot about everything and worry about my future, my relationships, or if I still have my bus ticket on me. But trying to see the realistic reason instead of my own interpretation helped me out a lot in many cases where I would've otherwise just felt attacked and cut myself off to some extent. I could comfort myself a little, take some of these doubts and thoughts off myself.\n\nMaybe these thoughts and this mindset can help some of the anxious overthinkers like me raise your spirits and catch yourselves should you fall.",

            "selftext": "I\u2019ve had the worst week of my life. Pretty much lost the will to live. My anxiety has been at a all time high since I calmed it down a while ago. As seen via my last post I got sexually assaulted nearly 7 days ago and I\u2019ve been going off the rails ever since. I\u2019ve barely been sober and have been promiscuous which I\u2019ve never been before and I have no idea why after my assault all I want it for boys to respect me and say the right things before any sexual activity occurs. I had a boy say to me he wanted to get to know me before we had sex even though it was a one night stand and if it wasn\u2019t for that nothing would of happened between us. It gave me at the time some false sense of security knowing I\u2019m worth something and I\u2019m not actually just a disposable machine that\u2019s only good for one thing and that\u2019s it?\n\nI went out last night and I\u2019ll spare the details as about 5 different events happened all absolutely terrible and a lot of people fell out but I got a message from a friend saying to come to a party and I ended up calling him, the person who\u2019s party it was I had a thing with for 6 months last year but he messed me around and got on girls in front of me, so my mate went to pass the phone to him and he hung up, didn\u2019t think he wanted me to go from the start and I didn\u2019t want to either I was saying no to going for days prior when mutual friends were asking me to go then I find out it wasn\u2019t actually my friend messaging me it was someone who clearly didn\u2019t like me and wanted me to show up just to be turned away so luckily that didn\u2019t happen... until...\n\nI went to meet my other friend hours later who begged me to go back to the apartment with him and I said until you speak to the one who\u2019s apartment it is it not going like I\u2019m pretty sure he doesn\u2019t even like\nMe although I never done anything bad to him at all I\u2019m pretty sure I loved him but so my friend calls and he passed the phone to someone else who says to bring me and whoever else so we show up just to be told no I can\u2019t come in.\n\nI feel absolutely humiliated, I know a few of them don\u2019t like me that\u2019s evident and I\u2019m not sure why because I\u2019ve not personally met any of them that don\u2019t seem to like me, a lot of it has to be because of the guy I used to see and another guy I used to see who was also there. There was also drama as on friday someone slyly took a picture of me with a boy who had his arm around me who has a girlfriend (which I didn\u2019t know) so everyone knows it\u2019s me but they\u2019re only not saying anything because the boy would fight all of them and probably win and his girlfriend showed up and punched him in the face and said he cheated on her, so I was quite a big topic of conversation in that apartment clearly and it\u2019s giving me such bad anxiety I\u2019m just worrying what people think of me and what was said about me I just don\u2019t know what to do... I feel like I need to redeem myself but yet I\u2019ve just done nothing wrong?",
