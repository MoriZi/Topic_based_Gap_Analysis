Turns out, I just needed to find the right one. \n\nA few years ago, a judgy hygenist told me I had gingivitis and that I needed to \"get my act together\" or my teeth would fall out and the rest of my health would go with it. I was bleeding when she flossed my gums. Admittedly, I hadn't been the best flosser, but I had been flossing. \n\nFast forward and I hadn't been back to the dentist since. A lot of it had to do with anxiety about \"what if I have gingivitis?\" and \"what if they say all my teeth are going to fall out?\" \n\nI had an appointment with a new dentist this week. \n\nAlso, I asked my new hygenist if I had gingivitis because I could taste blood when she flossed.  She said \"most people will bleed when I floss and clean because I'm reaching areas that they can't. Most everyone has a little problem with gingivitis at some point, just like most everyone has issues with low vitamin D. \n\nThis helped me so much that I ALMOST told her I didn't need the gas anymore.   \nAlmost.",

I need activities to focus my mind on to keep me tethered to calmness and nor spiral from anxiety. Some things I do include gaming, reading, writing, walking/hiking, watching TV, and journaling.\n\nMore on the journaling- I'm not suggesting that I am neglecting or ignoring my anxiety; I dedicate times to journaling so I can appropiatley process my thoughts and feelings. It frustrates me a little when people on the internet are quick to coin the term \"distractions\" in what appears to be a demeaning way. Keeping in mind that I do devote time to acknolwedging my anxiety, there's nothing wrong with otherwise devoting my free/leisure time to my hobbies/passions for not only my enjoyment, but a relief from my anxiety, is there?\n\nAny input I could get would be immensely appreciated, please.\n\nThank you.",

            "selftext": "Lets start with i dont actually know what exactly it is. I could be anxiety, right ? or no ?\n\nI will try to make it as short as possible. I was getting haircut when my head started shaking for the first time ever. It was 8-11 months ago. After that time i started thinking about it, tried to think about something else while getting haircut, tried focusing on music nothing helped. After every haircut my shaking started getting worse and worse. Currently it evolved to shaking in front of people ( i work as a salesmen, i talk directly with people). Right now i cant even play the games on my computer. I mean i can but i shake all the time, there is no brake time. I dont shake at all when i walk, sleep, use my phone in the bed.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBefore we jump to conclusions some facts about me. I think it is most likely anxiety, but still i try to consider other options:\n\n1. I never cook. I always eat already prepared food like chicken, beef ( other kind of meat), fish, burgers, pizza, salad. I dont remeber last time i ate fruits, not prepared veggies. Also i skip breakfast for already 5 years. My first food comes at 1PM. It could be because i lack vital vitamins. \n2. I had depression, so i came up with solution to get over with. I started playing video games. It helped me to overcome it. I spent almost 6 years playing video games(i overcame depression in probably 1 year), i enjoy games up to this day. Currently i spend all the free time on games. I sit in front of my computer for almost 10-14 hours. Then i go to sleep, work for few days (talk with people), then i do it again. My other option is because of back problems. Tho i use gaming chair (dx racer something 300\u20ac) to keep my posture normal.\n3. I never leave my home. I simply dont enjoy going to clubs, partys or anything where i have to interact with people. Yeah i know, i got gaming addiction, but right now i dont care about anything else. I leave my home only when i have to go to work or buy some food. I never traveled anywhere, i dont go to cinema, i dont go to park, i dont like buying new stuff, because i dont care about it. Also no friends, only my colleagues, but i dont care about it. All it matters for me is spending time playing games. I am thinking it is because i am burned out. I need to go out more or take vacation. The thing is i am not bored from work or games.\n4. I work as a salesman. I talk all day with people that comes to the store and sell them stuff. Results are important, if you show bad result you can get the fu\\*\\* out. I never cared about money, all i need is enough to justify my needs. My needs right now are good gaming pc, that is all (already got it). But stuff happened, new people came in, old people left. Right now to stay in the top you need to put some actual effort. By effort i mean you need to concentrate on watching the store, if you see client and come  first to him is yours. Also you need to sell extra stuff(extended warranty, insurance and other shi\\*). It doesnt matter if he dont need it at all, YOU NEED TO SELL IT. If client only takes product(phone, laptop etc) it is not good for you. Other go in front of you and you can lose your job. I always acted like i didnt cared about it, but deep in my mind i knew that i want to stay on top, so every sale matters. Also i dont want to quit this job, because i love it. It is not like i am afraid of people or my job. I always go in with full confidence, you cant bring me to my kneels. I can find answer to every quesetion you will ask me(talking about customers) even if i dont know correct answer.  This compensates for living alone and spending all time playing games solo. I dont feel lonely in home, when i come back after work. For me it is balance. I talk few days non stop, then i rest few days, then repeat. In the end i think i started to care more about the job than i was caring before, i changed. This is last option and i think it lead me to ?anxiety?\n5. Was heavy energy drink user. I used energy drinks everyday for about 8 years ( currently 26 years old). I quit in a few weeks when my head started shaking a little. After then i never touched anything with caffeine in it.\n\nThis is all options i could think off. I could just go to doctor, but it is quarantine and it is not possible to do that right now. I am on my own.  \n\n\nThinking about trying xanax tomorrow, just one tablet. It is personal test, if it helps to reduce/remove symptoms i will label it as anxiety. If not i need to see a doctor.",

            "selftext": "My interview was supposed to be the second week of June but I called to ask if they could squeeze me in earlier if anybody else cancelled. The recruiter told me they had an opening TOMORROW! I\u2019m so anxious for this. I thought I had 2 more weeks to prepare and now I have less than 24 hours. I\u2019m excited to possibly get a job but I\u2019m also extremely nervous. \n\nWhenever I have to do new things or change my schedule I have a really hard time picturing myself actually doing the task. I know I\u2019m going to an interview tomorrow, but I can\u2019t see myself actually at the interview. I know I\u2019ll be working eventually, but I can\u2019t picture myself actually being confident enough to actually do the job... does anybody else have these feelings?\n\nLogically I know I\u2019m going to need to work eventually. I\u2019ve been going to school for 3 years for this so it\u2019s something I definitely want, but I\u2019m physically unable to imagine myself actually doing it well and being good at it. \n\nMy biggest symptom of anxiety is facial flushing... if I wasn\u2019t so scared of turning blotchy red I wouldn\u2019t even be nervous at all! I can\u2019t control it. Even when I\u2019m with friends and family my face flushes and my chest get splotches of red. My doctor prescribed me propranolol for \u201cperformance anxiety\u201d but I haven\u2019t had the chance to try it out yet and I\u2019m nervous that it won\u2019t work!",

            "selftext": "I feel a bit nervous about posting but here goes.\n\nI have had anxiety and depression on and off for many years now. I\u2019m currently on valdoxan for depression which works amazingly. I do CBT which has helped me in the past, and up until recently I think was helping me a lot.\n\nTwo weeks ago I found out my aunty, who has had terminal cancer for some time, is no longer receiving treatment and will only have a few months left. My mum (her sister) died very suddenly from cancer two years ago, and this aunty is like my second mum. I never got the chance to grieve properly for family, work and study related reasons, and currently in therapy, I\u2019m working on coming to terms with my mum passing. This news is stirring up a buttload of memories and emotions, which is fine, but my anxiety has gotten so bad to the point of me being unable to function day-to-day. I can\u2019t sleep, I feel like I\u2019m gonna throw up or choke, I have crying fits, I\u2019m scared to leave the house, and my mind is so noisy. I do yoga, running, mindfulness when I can (at the moment every other day). The anxiety often passes in the afternoon, but the mornings at the moment are unbearable, I can\u2019t live like this. \n\nI should add that I\u2019ve just recently moved abroad, and don\u2019t think I can get back to my home country Cos of travel restrictions. I don\u2019t speak the language here and so there\u2019s the anxiety from that building up too. \n\nSo basically, I\u2019m wondering if there\u2019s something that I can take occasionally when the anxiety is so bad that I can\u2019t do anything else to soothe it for a little bit. I have an appointment with psychiatrist tomorrow but I think it\u2019s always good to go in with some kind of idea. \n\nI really hope you guys can help. Thanks in advance.",

I haven't been on any dates in about 2 years. \n\nI'm very good at talking to matches from dating apps and at calls/video calls, but the thought of meeting up on a date fills me with first anxiety, and then dread. \n\nI have arranged dates multiple times over the past 2 years and each time as I have drawn closer to the date I have cancelled. I have lost many great girls like this. \n\nUp until about 2016, I could go on dates quite easily. I didn't have this sense of dread. Then about midway during 2016 I started to feel small degrees of panic. Losing concentration, intense nausea during dates, hot flushes, tight throat, sweating, unable to focus on what's being said, heart palpitations and perhaps some other things I can't remember right now. \n\nThis panic builds to a point where I'm possessed by a compulsion to \"escape\". I have to get out. \n\nThis has plagued me since then. Strangely enough, if I meet someone randomly, I can handle myself well. Similarly if I meet a female friend I don't have the same problem.\n\nDoes anyone have any helpful thoughts or advice? \n\nThank you,\nChris",

            "selftext": "Currently enduring forgetting to breathe / not breathing properly / not breathing at all / manually breathing / air hunger / breathing and heart stopping all day everyday.. am I going to die? \n\nDistractions are not working, even when I'm watching TV or listening to music or talking to others I can still experience and feel these sensations. \n\nMeditation and Yoga? It's my 3rd time doing YOGA and I don't know if it's helping but i kinda feel the same. Been doing meditation since last month, I feel it works during the moment then I'm back with the same sensations. \n\nExercise? I love doing workouts, I do it daily.  I do at home dance exercises and go for a jog and walk. \nI don't know if this is helping either. But when I'm outside I kind of feel back to my regular self. \n\nHelp? I've been trying.. I've been trying all week and since the start of this month trying to get through to my local doctors and university doctors and still no luck. Every day I'm tempted to call the ER/hospital because I fear something is terribly wrong with my heart and breathing and I'm dying inside. I'm also going to call those anxiety helplines because I need professional help and I need a resolution to this HA. Everybody is just watching me suffer. \n\nI need help... I need therapy, I need treatment, I need advice and support, I'm open to medication. \nI feel so lost during these times, I don't feel right nor okay in my body, I need a overall health checkup that everything in my body is fine and doing its job.\n\nThese breathing problems have been my BIGGEST challenge. Anyone experienced something similar?",
