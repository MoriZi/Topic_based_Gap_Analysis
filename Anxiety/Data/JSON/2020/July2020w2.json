Just going from being completely fine 10 level to horrific vomiting I need to sit down 2 level in literally seconds. For multiple reasons. \n\n\nI was adding BBQ sauce to some extremely cold almost frozen pork meat and it was mildly painful how cold it was but it was 3 minutes of doing that and I had a wave of severe nausea and high blood pressure for a minute while I was warming my hands back up in the sink then felt totally fine. That's never happened before and kind of freaked me out.\n\n\nThat's a complete coin flip though such as riding the bus. I can be completely fine and then be hit with severe carsickness and nausea and it can last the whole bus ride or just surprise 2 horrible minutes of feeling like I'm dying completely out of nowhere for no reason sometimes. Just wondering if that's a somewhat common anxiety feeling or if it would be more someone with thyroid problems feeling....",

And then I come home and get on my phone and see ads such as \"They turned OCD into a game\", and of course,  the ad is about organization and perfectionism. These kinds of things really hurt. I know these things can be expierienced by some people with OCD, but it is a very small percentage. I know whenever people use it as an adjective, they don't mean any harm, but this really needs to be talked about more often to stop the spread of false information.",

I was surfing the internet and I don't like someone with me when I spend time with me. And I suddenly started feeling anxious.\n\nI don't have actual reasons but probably the following ones.\n\n1. I saw a post about someone's death\n2. I have a lot of work to do, still, I'm wasting time.\n3. As I said before, My parent's were talking on the phone ( In my country people really talk loud at home and phone )\n\nI tried listening to music. It works but I was way too anxious, so It didn't work!\n\nI'm going to do my work maybe it'll help me. If it sounds stupid I'm really sorry for wasting your time.\n\nDo you ever felt like this and what do you recommend to overcome such anxiety?",

And a year ago, I was sorta okay with it  (It's not like I can do anything about it, and I didn't want to be the strict and possesive gf, so I tried to accept it) But over the year I've become more anxious.. \nI also by accident discovered his search history regarding the topic..  and the things he searched...... \nI am nothing like those things. Polar opposite to be exact. And also stuff that I know he likes or would like to try, but that I've said no to. \nAnd ever since I've had stomach aches, a feeling like a stick through my heart everytime he jokes about his porn searches. I've been thinking that I'm not good enough for him since I could never give or be those things. \nWe've been together for almost 2 years, but still.. I've cried myself to sleep about not feeling good enough for him and being afraid of losing him to someone who could be like/give that...\n\nSo what do I do and have anyone else experienced anything similar?",

            "selftext": "*(Sorry this ended up being so long, much appreciation to those who read it!)* Hey everyone, I have moderate health anxiety that periodically flares up whenever I experience something even remotely in the same area as something I worry about. For instance, I got a small surgical procedure on my tailbone a over half a year ago and was doing really well with it until I noticed a tiny little bump that appeared to be an ingrown hair. I simply tweezed it out and that was it, but my worries about it and what it means for my problem potentially recurring have run amok. Despite completely trusting my surgeon and going to about 5 follow ups and him telling me everything looks all healed and that I shouldn't be overly worried about recurrence, I find myself having a tiny ingrown hair and a tiny bump erasing months of my psychological and emotional progress.\n\nUpon reading about health anxiety on psychology sites, I came across [this](https://psychcentral.com/blog/hyper-worried-about-your-health-3-tips-to-help/) incredibly helpful article. It all makes sense to me, especially in terms of seeking reassurance about my symptoms and my position online. That's only temporary and simply perpetuates the problem. This I understand. But does anyone have any advice in terms of letting my anxious thoughts and feelings \"run their course\"? This is what I am having trouble understanding. As I'm sure many can relate, I have an extremely difficult time putting these thoughts out of my head. I go watch a movie to distract myself, in the back of my stupid head I think \"Well those actors don't have to worry about a \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_ (insert whatever health concern I currently have on my mind).\" It is completely irrational and yet I don't know how to deal with that. It's also all the more unusual because reasonably, I know its not a big deal. Even the absolute worst case scenario (such as, with this current issue, needing to go through the procedure again), isn't even that bad. I liked my surgeon. He also told me there's nothing to worry about. And I do believe him. But for some reason, I can't seem to let it go, and I certainly don't know how to or what \"letting it run its course\" means. If anyone has any tips or advice in this regard, I'd be very grateful!",

            "selftext": "I have a special kind of anxiety where certain life circumstances cause me to go in some kind of hyper focus. I can't stop worrying about my life, i am on edge constantly and i cant focus on anything else besides my thoughts and those life circumstances. Nervousness is supposed to help you so your senses are sharpened for certain situations. But if I cant even answer simple questions from my mother like \"what do you want to drink?\" or \"When did you wake up?\" my nervousness  is clearly toohigh. This constant state of alertness makes normal interactions with other people feel almost \"annoying\".  My mother always tells me \"You think too much.\" or \"Don't worry so much.\" when i visit her but I don't know how to stop this. I can't \"just stop\". I feel like I have extra weight on my shoulders like everybody else has, BUT in my situation I cant just take the weight off and be done for the day. I am constantly living in the future it feels like. I worry about stuff that is in the near future, in 2 years or even in like 10 years. I will push through tho. As i always have, but i just wanted to put this into a text. I always thought i had depression or something like that. But the base of it all is that i have anxiety problems it seems. Whatever.

            "selftext": "I went to my physical a few weeks ago (20F) feeling brave enough to talk about my anxiety, which I feel like has been getting worse.\n\nI\u2019m not diagnosed with any type of anxiety  currently, but my intention was to talk about it with the doctor. To me, the level of anxiety (+the things that come with it) I feel surpasses the \u201cnormal\u201d meter.\n\nSomething important to note is usually when I go here I don\u2019t see my primary care doctor, as he\u2019s male and I\u2019m just more comfortable around the female doctors/NP\u2019s for my own reasons so I usually see the same 2-3 women every time I come but this time I had one I hadn\u2019t seen. She isn\u2019t a new doctor but I think she was fairly new to the office.\n\n\nI had mentioned my anxiety to a different doctor here the previous year and I mentioned to her it\u2019s the main reason I don\u2019t drive\u2014 driving gives me a huge amount of anxiety. I don\u2019t remember if I specifically mentioned this to the current doctor I had seen.\n\n\nFast forward to the Dr\u2019s appt and it comes to the \u201ctalking\u201d portion and even though it\u2019s weeks later thinking back on it I feel like I did a horrible job at trying to describe my anxiety properly to her which resulted in her basically giving me an informational packet about it that she thinks will help with most of it. \n\n\nIt basically had things like breathing exercises (which I already knew), to avoid drugs and alcohol because they\u2019ll worsen the symptoms, and things like that. Even though this is the second time I\u2019ve brought it up to a doctor there it felt like she said my anxiety isn\u2019t \u2018enough\u2019 to really need to do anything and that a certain amount of anxiety is a good thing.\n\n\nNow I\u2019m thinking it\u2019s my fault because I did awful just explaining how I feel but it\u2019s because even bringing up anxiety to my doctor made me anxious, even just going to the doctor!\n\n\nI tried to explain how I often had been getting a huge sense of dread when everything is perfectly content, or how Id get a lot of anxiety before work too. She asked if it\u2019s ever stopped me from going to work and I said no because it hasn\u2019t- even on my worst days when I\u2019m crying up until right before work I still force myself to go even when my mind feels awful. However in person I really wasnt able to elaborate that, all I said was I just push through it usually and go to work. \n\nI also told her the overthinking keeps me up at night because my mind just won\u2019t stop, for this she mentioned melatonin (which I do take occasionally). At this point though I smoke some weed/eat an edible to help me sleep and be calm at night.\n\n\nThe thing is don\u2019t think it\u2019s normal to have to wake up and automatically feel anxious with a tight chest and no desire to get up because doing anything may give me that anxious feeling where my mind won\u2019t stop. I\u2019m a homebody anyways and with the pandemic it\u2019s not like there\u2019s much reason to leave your house besides work (for some), but generally even when there isn\u2019t a pandemic I don\u2019t like to go out besides with my really close friends.\n\n\nAnother thing that gives me a lot of anxiety is social interactions, before any social interaction with cashiers, etc, I\u2019m always extremely nervous. This part of my anxiety I feel like I\u2019ve helped myself with as usually it\u2019ll be fine if I rehearse what to say in my head, make sure I have the exact money out because I don\u2019t want to fumble, etc. but strangers *still* give me a lot of apprehension and don\u2019t even get me started on what phone calls do to me.\n\n\nAt this point I don\u2019t know what to do, I feel like I tried to get some help to improve myself and it failed. It\u2019s already hard enough for me to express my feelings as it is so I guess I\u2019m just feeling pretty bummed and decided to come on here and just vent.\n\nI\u2019d love to see what you guys think, if you have any advice or experiences yourself it\u2019d be deeply appreciated. \n\n*also, sorry for any typos or if this post is just everywhere, I\u2019m kind\u2019ve stressed at the moment and on mobile*",

I do attribute alot of these to my already anxious mind and long sitting laptop work and weird postures. Random shortness of breath and shallow breaths aswell. \n\n\nBut for the peace of mind got an ECG done. Came out perfectly normal. BP 126/83. Pulse was 95. Spo2 99. Sooo I am feeling a bit relaxed. Also doctor mentioned that a pain in arm that has been there for months wouldn't be related to heart and leans towards posture related issues.\n\nThoughts?\n\nI have health anxiety ofcourse.",
