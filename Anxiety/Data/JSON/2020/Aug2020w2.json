            "selftext": "I don't usually post on reddit, but I've seen that there are some really nice people in this community so I decided to post too. \nI have been struggling with anxiety for almost 2 years now, mostly mild but it has recently been getting worse, especially since covid broke out. \nToday I found out I have cancer, a type called Hodgkin Lymphoma. It apparently is, thankfully, one of the easiest forms of cancer, with a chance of recovery of about 90%. It also helps that I discovered it in its early stages and that I am an otherwhise healthy 18 yo. But, it still comes as quite a shock to be told that you have cancer, no matter what type or how likely recovery is. I still have to go through chemo now, which scares me a bit, but hopefully, it's not going to kick my butt too hard. To add to everything, the virus really scares me now, beacuse chemo and the illness will affect my immune system quite a bit, so it's safe to say my anxiety will skyrocket these days. I try to be as postive as possible but it's pretty hard when I think about everything I'll have to go through, especially since my mind tends to think about the worst. \nIf this post doesn't belong here, please let me now where I could post. I just feel really down right now, probably not going to be able to sleep due to anxiety.",

I'm finally out of isolation and ran out of Ativan. Now I can't sleep, been up for days and my anxiety is through the roof! I went to urgi care and they gave me ambian...didn't work so I resorted to xanax .5 at bedtime which ive taken twice and it worked. I took it last night and I barely slept. I'm really scared. I feel like I've gotten myself in a benzo trap. Doctor suggested I get on klonipin to taper off. Another doctor said I don't need tapering. I just don't get it!!! I'm at a loss. I just want to be able to sleep again and feel normal. I'm not sure if the insomnia is from my anxiety due to covid or from the 3 weeks of Ativan at .5 per day. Any thoughts?",

            "selftext": "My worst fear happened today. My boyfriend woke up feeling really sick today with a 102 degree fever, headache, chills, etc and i\u2019m terrified. I already have really bad health anxiety regularly and as you can imagine this whole pandemic has been extra stressful for me because of it. I have taken every precaution possible including quitting my job and ordering my groceries to be delivered to avoid even going to the market. My boyfriend was unfortunately required to return to work in the past months but did wear a mask the whole time he was there. I don\u2019t know how he could have caught it since we don\u2019t go anywhere but somehow he is sick. I\u2019m terrified because I live at home with mom who is 65 years old and I\u2019m so afraid of giving it to her and having something happen to her. When he told me he was sick I cried and then proceeded to cry several more times throughout the day. I began wearing a mask in the house to try and protect my mom if I am infected and don\u2019t know yet. We don\u2019t know for sure it\u2019s COVID but with his symptoms and the current state of the country it\u2019s impossible not to assume the worst while we wait for testing. Now i\u2019m getting a tight aching pain in the muscles between my shoulder blades and I\u2019m convinced it\u2019s the start of body aches or something. I\u2019m laying awake and can\u2019t sleep and giving myself a stomach ache from the anxiety. Any advice to keep calm during this time?",

            "selftext": "I got in an argument with someone back in early June and started having mild pain/squeezing/discomfort on my right side...i wasn't too worried as this usually has always happened to me whenever i go through something stressful or am flowed with intense emotions and anger.. also for note, prior to this argument, it has been a very stressful few months for me with a major breakup that has effected me immensely more than i could ever imagine as well as, 2 major deaths in my family in a span of just 2 months, along with major issues at work...&amp; money issues.. in a couple days the discomfort from my right side transferred to my left side which is where i become extremely concerned. I also noticed on my left lower side near my breast area when i first get an episode of intense discomfort i will get a red itchy patch that looks like eczema &amp; burns...usually it goes away within a few hours, even though the discomfort stays.. i had anxiety of what this pain may be, and it made me feel even worse as i went insane thinking it was a heart issue.. I went to the doctor and had an ECG done, and vitals and everything were perfect..i have a good heart rate monitor app on my phone and whenever i get the discomfort i check and my heart rate is normal. The doctor said i have Costochondritis which would make sense since the same day i was in the argument i was helping a friend move and did lots of pushing and lifting...ive also had other upper body muscle aches, arm and side of my ribs hurt so bad that the whole rest of the month of June i was basically was unable to move without feeling like i had just been in a horrible car crash.. taking advil every few hours as my doctor recommended however, those major body aches went away &amp; for the most part im fine but if i lift anything or tug on anything too hard my left arm particularly will start hurting and i will feel body aches again..so the costochondritis diagnosis does make sense for that reason...however...what doesnt make sense to me is that any confrontation i have..even..a small dispute, if i cry over something and feel \"intense\" feelings, usually anger..or even if i run or suddenly jump up (like a jump scare) i get the \"pain\" &amp; discomfort in the left side of my chest along with the weird feeling on my arm...it just feels my heart is going a million miles an hour .... &amp; i sometimes get really shaky for a while after...i usually take an aspirin or rub some vaporub and it eases, but usually once i get it..it lasts for hours all day until the next day or even 2..i'm a 23 yr old female &amp; don't have any family history of heart problems..&amp; while i do trust my doctor i also have had countless sleepless nights because my pain/discomfort gets so bad that im pretty sure im having a heart attack &amp; am about to die...then the worrying makes my heart beat out my chest more... i also noticed upon trying to sleep &amp; being in a resting state i get heart palpitations...but i always constantly feel like i \"am fragile\" and any little emotion even getting excited over something good will cause chest discomfort.. so ive really tried to just be numb and not feel anything lately...in fear of that chest pain/pressure...the last few months have been horrible and it is not an over exagerration to say ive had literal hell everyday.. I've never been in a deeper hole of depression than i am now...Does this sound anxiety/ depression/ stress related? Any tips, advice, comments or suggestions, or anything would be greatly appreciated...",

            "selftext": " \n\nHello, first actual reddit post I have ever made, as mentioned above I am going to be quitting weed to go on lexapro for anxiety. I have been smoking daily since I was 16 now 18, about a gram or half a gram a day. I smoke mostly for recreational pleasure, insomnia, and general anxiety. Weed really is the only \u201cdrug\u201d that I mesh with, don\u2019t really do anything else besides the occasional psychedelic trip. I have had anxiety in the past from school so I tested out and that seemed to stop it for quite awhile. Recently however I have been having panic attacks before work and some general anxiety that has caused me to go back to therapy. My therapist recommends I should try out anxiety meds to see if they could help me get everything figured out since this is the worst my anxiety has ever been. The doc wants me to stop smoking to start the lexapro off with a clean slate to make sure that the weed isn\u2019t causing me any anxiety (which I don\u2019t think it is but am open to it being a possibility). I still have a positive relationship with weed (although i know that long term chronic use can lead to some issues later in life and that does stress me out a little bit). I still am a little stressed about having to quit, fearful of withdrawals/insomnia. Any tips to stop smoking? Has anyone had any experiences with lexapro without using weed or experiences using both? Still not sure if I should use this opportunity to quit weed for good or to see how I am for a couple of months without it. Your thoughts and advice would be much appreciated.\n\nThank you for reading.",

I get really anxious cause of those critucs, therefore I barely go once in a year. I had to go this time cause I cut my hair too short and uneven at home, so I had to go to fix it up. Fortunately, My older sister needed a haircut as well, so I was fine going up together, it was a relief that I need not go alone.\n\nAlthough, I must say, I strongly felt to hide away and not go. Those flips in my stomach, ugh. I was so nervous and anxious but I just blanked out and simply moved my body. Whatever happens, happens. \n\nAh, I properly explained without stuttering or saying it too fast as to whatever he asked. Thankfully, the person who cut my hair didn't say anything to me at all. He just did his job, man, I'm so thankful for that. Ah, this was a bit challenging, but I'm glad I went!!",
