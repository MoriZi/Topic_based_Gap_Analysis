Sometimes I wonder what would happen if a plane crashed into my house and I died. Stuff like that. And I know it makes no sense to worry about it but its like my mind is attacking itself. I get intrusive thoughts i can't seem to control all the time. Has anybody else dealt with this? Any advice on some things I can do to help? It interferes with my life and its truly taking over me.

Still some panic attacks, but mostly because of some trigger (emetophilia mostly) \n\nBut the last few weeks, I started to have this anxiety feeling coming again strong, not just the occasional panic attacks.\nIn between few personal issues + covid, there are all reasons for, but I decided \"no more, not alone, not again\".\n\nI took an appointment with my GP for advice on who/where to go to start a therapy or something like that.\n\nIt's something so small, but it took me 20 years, since my first memory of anxiety issue, just to do it.\n\nNext step will be to actually follow her guidelines, but I'm already proud of myself",

I\u2019m sorry if this is a bit of a lengthy post, I\u2019ll try to keep it as short as I can. \n\nBasically, as the title says, my anxiety causes me to care way too much about what people think of me and it\u2019s really negatively impacting on me and my life. I am almost obsessed with needing people to like me and cannot stand the thought that someone might not. This isn\u2019t limited to friends, family and/or acquaintances either, this includes people I\u2019ve had barely any contact with and people who aren\u2019t in my life anymore. I know it\u2019s irrational and that not everyone is going to like me, but when I come across people who don\u2019t, I can\u2019t bare it; it causes me such extreme levels of anxiety and upset and massively ruins my self-esteem. I know that, to some degree, it\u2019s normal to feel a bit hurt/put out if someone doesn\u2019t like us, but the way it effects me is just not normal and it\u2019s hugely impacting on my life. It\u2019s exhausting and has gotten to the point where I feel like I have to prove myself to everyone around me. I\u2019m not sure how common these feelings are with anxiety, but if anyone has ever experienced anything like it, I could really use some suggestions on how to break these thought habits and reduce (even to a small degree) my need to be liked. I have tried counselling and CBT but, unfortunately, these have not helped this issue and so I\u2019m hoping someone might\u2019ve found something else useful? Any advice would be really appreciated or even just the acknowledgment that this is something someone else has been through because I feel so alone with this and unable to talk to anyone I know about it...again, due to my need to be liked/seen in a certain way.",

I know I\u2019ll pull out of it. Anyway my problem is I have this head sort of feeling where I\u2019m staring at something or moving my head and it feels weird like makes my heart start beating fast and makes me anxious. It feels like my head drop like you moved your head down fast but I haven\u2019t acc moved my head a lot of times. Feels like my head need to catch up. I\u2019ve gone from thinking it\u2019s epilepsy to a brain problem. Anyone else get this ? Also any tips to stop ? I been having loads of headaches since such and heavy head and pressure, pains. Dizzy/off balance feeling and lightheadedness. I get it most when I\u2019m hot and hungry maybe dehydrated but I only ever drink water nothing else! But that may not be the problem I\u2019m not sure what it is. Anyone have this ?",

            "selftext": "Hi guys, first of all I struggle with cardiophobia which induces anxiety and panic attacks, so summers are hard for me. \n\nSo basically today I was doing some work around the house which is kind of physically intense and I\u2019ve read about pushing myself out of comfort zone to kind of learn my body that everything is okay and that I won\u2019t die. (Funny statement to make but it\u2019s real, very real.)\n\nI did the first part and checked my heart rate which was 150 (normal for this kind of a job) and went inside to take a break. Heart rate went down to 80, everything cool. But then I started feeling anxious and had a minor panic attack.\n\nHowever, I decided to push myself today and went out to do the 2nd part. Almost at the end I started a serious panic attack but I pushed through till the end and then went inside.\n\nInside, I had multiple panic attacks, one after another. One started, lasted for 15 mins and ended, when I stood up and went somewhere - BOOM another panic attack. I struggled with them for about 90 minutes and now I\u2019m okay, feeling sore and sad but okay.\n\nShould I continue pushing myself every day like I did today? I\u2019m kinda happy that I managed to finish the work even if my heart was racing.\n\nAnybody with similar experience? I\u2019d love to hear your opinions or advice. Have a pleasant day :)",

            "selftext": "So in the various research Ive been going through Ive come across an interesting new theory that is a bit of a opposing stance towards meditation and breathing exercises. \nI was getting into the habit of stopping an all out panic attack by listening to particular 10 minute anxiety stopping meditation video. And it was super effective, relaxing, sometimes even got me to sleep instantly. Like this video was literal hypnosis. And I actually got kind of addicted to more hypnosis videos that were similar.\nThe big thing about them is they usually start the same.\n\u201cBreath deeply. Breath deeper than you breathed all day.\u201d\nThis is basically self induced form of hyperventilation. And hyperventilation (hv) can lead to other shifting symptoms you may feel.\nOnce your body feels a symptom the mind can then start the anxiety cycle based on that symptom and it starts again and again.\nSo while the meditations are very effective in the moment, they may just be band-aids and are not fixing the real problem. \n\nTL:DR\nBreathing exercises might imbalance the body\u2019s chemistry which can lead to anxiety caused symptoms.",

Idk, I'm taking my first 'vacation' from my first job all next week (using that term lightly since we are in a pandemic lol) and I feel like... guilty? I don't know. The days I had requested off from work were confirmed by my boss and he was okay with it, but I kind of spiraled earlier today thinking what if I get fired? What if it seems like I'm not taking my work seriously and I'm not good enough? I work in media, so the job market isn't very 'secure,'  that's all I'll say about that. This is my first real job too and my first paid vacation. I feel bad and like I'm slacking off?",

I\u2019m an infantry veteran of Afghanistan and I was medically retired from the army for depression, anxiety, and suicidal idealization. I went to school to become an electrician and after working in the field for a while, I found that the work negatively affects my already poor mental health. I\u2019m currently working in retail but I feel like it\u2019s a dead end. I can\u2019t leave it because of my spotty job history because I worked with three different employers within a year before my current job, and I still need a job to support myself. I\u2019ve thought of going back to school but COVID is going to prevent that to a point and I feel obligated to stay in the electrical field rather than pursue a different education. And I honestly don\u2019t know what career to pursue because I just think I\u2019m not good enough.\n\nWhat makes it worse is that I feel like I\u2019ve missed out on a crucial point in life: dating. I didn\u2019t date in high school because I was focused on my future in the army. And in the end I feel that women would be put off by a guy who hasn\u2019t had a serious relationship before and would walk away.\n\nWhat should I do?

Part of this comes from bad doctors experiences, poor experiences and treatment by the receptionist from the office, etc and part of it just comes from having anxiety surrounding talking on the phone and its unpredictability. Anyways, long story short I just moved to a new province (canada homie here) and I needed to get my prescription renewed and haven\u2019t been able to find a doctor here/clinics are over run right now from the ripple effects of COVID. I FINALLY got up the courage to call my doctors office back home just to ask if they could renew my prescription for a few months until I can get into a doctor or clinic here! The receptionist was snippy with me and tried to cut me off and deny my questions but i stood my ground (even though my heart was nearly beating out of my chest) and eventually she called back and gave me three months worth and I even went to the pharmacy did a long and complicated process to get it transferred and figured out (all things i have had anxiety over for months and why I have been putting it off) and i am going to pick up my prescription tomorrow!!!!! Just had to share this small victory with someone so here it is reddit world, i\u2019m feeling really proud of myself! :)",

            "selftext": "TL;DR The people who made me try to end my life are most likely coming to my school and just the anxiety alone is tearing me apart. I need any help/ advice you can give.\n\nJust for a bit of background, these are horrible people and drove me to attempt suicide a couple years ago, which opened the door for me to improve and get support. I moved schools and I\u2019ve come a long way, but I\u2019m really terrified because that was upper school and my new school has the most popular sixth form in our area, so there is a high chance at least one of them will be coming to my school. Furthermore, we will likely be travelling on the same bus if they do, and because of COVID our entire year will be in the same building, so I\u2019ll likely see them often.\n\nIf/ when I bump into them I want them to see they can\u2019t trample me anymore and to see how far I have come, but every time I think of them I feel small again. None of my friends get on my bus and so I\u2019ll be sat alone and I don\u2019t know how to handle seeing any of them.\n\nMy main emotional support is my sister but she\u2019s going to be miles away in uni and I won\u2019t see any of my friends until I\u2019m in school, but there is only one I can open up to. I am having a panic attack right now I think- that or I\u2019m just sobbing because I feel so out of control and scared. \n\nMy parents won\u2019t pay for me to have therapy anymore so I suppose I really just feel alone again, like I did when they were bullying me. I didn\u2019t realise until now how much this has been building up over quarantine and how stressed I am.\n\nI just feel so helpless and alone. I don\u2019t know what to do and I don\u2019t want to be weak again. Please help me. I don\u2019t know how but even a tiny  peice of advice or understanding would be amazing right now.

Espically the thought of having a panic attack half way there on the highway. I\u2019m actually very excited to see family but the nervousness is driving me crazy. Also Is there any positive anxiety group chats or anything, would be cool to have and give help when someone needs it.",

I will also get this weird tingly sensation in the middle of my back, like if my upper body was floating. I feel the urge to move around super fast so I rock back and fourth. I\u2019m constantly checking my heart beat. My heart rate goes to 100 - 110bpm by just sitting down or laying down. I\u2019m in fucking hell, sorry for my language. But sometimes I don\u2019t know what to do. I know how to get rid of panic attacks, but those methods don\u2019t work with my current situation. It\u2019s more of a anxiety attack. \n\nI started feeling like this after thinking if I took to much sodium because of my high blood pressure. Ever since then, my mind is going nuts on me. My own voice telling me I fucked up that I took to much, laughing at me, screaming at me, telling me over and over again that I took to much sodium. \n\nI know, I sound crazy. But I don\u2019t believe in therapy, i tried therapy from ages 11 - 16. It didn\u2019t do anything for me. I\u2019m terrified of taking medication. I\u2019m depressed to. I use to take Prozac when I was a teenager and did not like at all. Just want to know if they\u2019re is anybody out there like me, who checks their heart rate constantly, who drives themselves nuts like I do.",
