Not always, I still definitely struggle with anxiety still, but it\u2019s easier.\n\nI get this calmed down feeling like almost every day on the Prozac since it started working, I have no idea how to feel this calmed down normally. I was maybe this calm one time in the 6 months prior to noticing the Prozac working, and probably way longer than 6 months. Now it\u2019s almost every day.\n\nI swear I wondered if I was high the first time the meds started calming me down, I\u2019ve never been high but if you told me this was what being high was like...I feel like I can breathe deeper\n\nI\u2019m out of the depression I was in too, so that\u2019s cool. Starting to feel happy again.\n\nMy OCD is significantly reduced, things have been getting a lot easier there. \n\nI feel like I\u2019m more able to handle rejection than before too.\n\nI also apparently hit the jackpot because it increases my sex drive? Only other side effect I\u2019m sure of is vivid dreams.\n\nNot sure I\u2019ll ever get off this stuff lol\n\nETA: wow this got more comments than I thought lol, will try to respond but: obviously, consult a doctor before making any decisions with your medication. Anything I say is either my personal experience or what I believe to be widely accepted among doctors, and I\u2019m trying to be clear on which is which. I can pull up sources if anyone wants them.\n\nAlso interestingly I feel like I\u2019m not sure how much the meds help once something triggers my anxiety, but they definitely bring down the baseline. I think it\u2019s a little harder to trigger but maybe goes just as high when triggered? Idk. I do notice a lot less nausea, which I would have a lot from anxiety before. I would say my current anxiety/OCD is still above average but lessened.\n\nI got on them for depression but have also been diagnosed with OCD, depersonalization, and GAD. I would say the GAD is the mildest of them all, but I also used to think I had really low anxiety that I now know was actually just had a pretty constant level of significant anxiety lol. I\u2019ve never had a panic attack so I can\u2019t speak to that.\n\nI was diagnosed by a therapist and also had a full psych eval, so when I saw my doctor I had pretty complete documentation on all of my issues and had been in weekly therapy for a few months. So they didn\u2019t really question whether or not they should prescribe me medication. I was also having thoughts of hurting myself so I think everyone kind of wanted me on meds lol.",

There\u2019s just no way I can see myself living without any regret. I would love to, but I will regret losing my family and friends to death. It\u2019s the scariest thing I can think of. Not existing. Like, no matter what, you always have your own thoughts, that\u2019s the one thing almost every human is guaranteed, thoughts. But to just all of a sudden not have that, I just can\u2019t wrap my head around it. Like, what the fuck? You always have to like, be somewhere, you have to think of something.

I know everyone has moments when they cringe at something embarrassing they\u2019ve done but I feel like I really let things I\u2019m not proud of bring me down immensely. Especially things that are job-related. \n\nI took on a teaching job two years ago and I was definitely out of my element, I would even say I was catastrophically bad. To be fair I was not given much guidance and I was working far more than I should have been, but I still feel ashamed for not already knowing how to be a good teacher before I arrived. I know everyone says the first year of teaching is hard but I still feel like I was worse than your average beginner. \n\nI have since grown so much and I am proud of that, but for some reason I keep going back to how I was in the beginning. I\u2019m paranoid my coworkers think I\u2019m terrible despite my growth and accomplishments. I find I\u2019m comparing myself to other people my age and how confident they are whereas I feel like a fraud. I used to feel extremely proud for overcoming my challenges, meaning nothing could bother me and I felt great... until recently. Maybe it\u2019s the confinement? I find I\u2019m also super sensitive to comments lately (from anyone; friends, colleagues and acquaintances) and attach negative meanings to them that might not be there. \n\nWhat is something you think could help me move on from this?

I was so tired of Facebook and all of the stupid posts I had to see daily, so I impulsively deleted it in February and haven't looked back. I kept Instagram because I love photos, but after seeing a frenemy's holier than thou post tonight (one of many), I decided to ditch it since it gives me anxiety. I am keeping Reddit for the moment mainly because I like to peruse a few subs. I feel like social media causes so much inner turmoil and strife, and I finally feel free ditching it. Life is better when you aren't constantly being told how to live.",

            "selftext": "I have always been a crier. I hate confrontation, and any strong emotion brings on the tears, even when they're inappropriate for the situation or how I'm feeling.\n\nLike this morning, my boyfriend confronted me about leaving dishes to soak overnight. For context, our dish habits are foreign to each other. He likes things rinsed thoroughly and set on the counter to prepare for washing, while I grew up soaking things in the basin before washing to make it easier and save counter space. I usually accommodate him, but yesterday, I felt like shit. Depression and anxiety had me at the throat all day and I just wasn't thinking about it when I left the pots to soak.  \n\nNaturally, he was upset and talked to me about it. He was perfectly reasonable and kind. I knew I messed up and apologized. He apologized for ambushing me, gave me a hug, and it was fine...except it WASN'T and I was holding back tears the whole time and immediately started crying when he went to the bedroom. It's like I can't NOT cry because if I hold it back, it just eats at me for the rest of the day.\n\nI hate that my anxiety makes me so uber sensitive. I'm learning to live with it, but it's still embarrassing and hard to explain to people. Especially since I'm a bartender - if you're in the service industry culture, you know that there's a lot of pressure to be tough and impervious to negativity. I've been denied promotions at other jobs because some nights, I've had to remove myself for like \\~15 minutes just to screw my head back on. It SUUUUCKS...\n\nThanks for reading my vent, if you did. If you deal with this too, then you're not alone and I love you.",

I was constantly having panic attacks everyday while at the mental hospital and bothered them so much to get my vitals checked all 7 days. If I was at home I probably would have had 2 more er bills that\u2019s how bad my attacks kept getting. The doctor I had would ask me how my appetite and sleep was everyday because I was put on new medicine for anxiety and depression. The main thing the doctor asked me each day was how I slept and I would say about 5-6 hours but I didn\u2019t know because we didn\u2019t have a clock in our rooms. Today I feel much better than I have in the past month and it\u2019s because I finally got a full night of sleep and changed my diet and I started walking everyday.

I don\u2019t wish to be the cause of any upsetting thoughts. Just need a void to speak into, because I'm tired of existing when all I ever seem to feel anymore are thoughts of panic, despair, and anxiety.\n\nMy anxiety has been getting much worse lately, despite me being on Lexapro. It hasn\u2019t come out of nowhere; I\u2019ve been through a recent turn of events that have caused me to lose most trust in people, as well as a complete loss of self-esteem. Add on to that my bad ways of idealism and anxiety on BEHALF of others and everything gets worse. I\u2019m constantly having panic attacks, silently hyperventilating and crying \"on the inside\", becoming paralyzed, etc.\n\nI literally just wish I did not exist. I hate it when people look at me. I feel as though I am constantly being judged and that I am regarded as being one of the worst, most pathetic people in the world. I have nowhere and nobody to turn to because my own brain is sick and I can\u2019t trust anyone around me. Of course, with this quarantine, it\u2019s not like I can really go out anyway, but that actually makes it worse, because I know once quarantine is over and everyone is back to normal I will fall even more anxious because I won\u2019t be normal. \n\nI won\u2019t want to be seen out, I won\u2019t want to be looked at, I won\u2019t want to interact with anyone. I wish I could be invisible. A ghost carrying a bag of priority mail packages to the post office, a ghost carrying a wristlet down the sidewalk, a ghost that could see everything and everyone but not be seen, heard, or interacted with. I wish I could silently watch the world and not be regarded at all as I did so I could finally be safe.\n\nPlease don\u2019t regard this as me being suicidal; I\u2019m not suicidal at all. I know this will all pass, and I\u2019ll likely flatline within minutes and go \u201chuh\u201d when I reread this and feel fine. Then it\u2019ll all start again. I just wish I didn\u2019t exist so I wouldn\u2019t have to interact with anyone, especially myself. I wish my body didn\u2019t exist, that no brain was there to panic and think and live with myself, and that even in death I would just *poof* be gone. No body, no ashes. Nothing. Nothing at all.",

I remember spending my lunch break in first grade just running around the playground cause I needed to go the bathroom but couldn't bring myself to ask a duty. I have always had a feeling of being inferior to literally everyone and that something was wrong with me. Public speaking would lead to me just trembling as I try to say my presentation as fast as I could. Never told my doctor about these issues because I never really told anyone. Wouldn't have mattered since I was very against medication due to the belief it's all my own fault and that I could get over it. Never really have myself credit but I really really tried. Took speech class twice to give me that experience. Started rock climbing to get over my fear of heights (this took a long time). Despite my efforts I still found doing simple things like going to the bank extremely difficult. Would spend my days doing nothing and would stressed over doing nothing. I feel like I really missed the true college experience since I would never take people up on their invitations (or would force myself but still end up not talking to anyone). The thing that sucked the most is that video production has always been my passion and the anxiety was always in the way of succeeding in that. A bit after college I finally ended trying anxiety medication. It took a while and was losing hope but damn has Zoloft turned my mind around. The first time in my life I actually dont feel miserable all the time. Recently I went to the bank and felt so damn good cause it was actually easy! I see that I have worth and there's a lot to like. I can now see Im not too bad looking and dony feel the need change clothes five times before settling in something plain. I still have a lot of fears but can feel good that I am trying my best. Used to think I was super boring but now I think I'm actually a pretty funny and a genuinely caring guy (despite having the background I thankfully never ventured into the \"nice guy\" mindset). I have a lot of potential in video production and feel a lot more confident in producing some of my scripts (hell my film won best short at my University's film festival). Yeah I might not be strongest or the coolest person out there but I can now feel good about just being me. Not every one's gonna like who I am and for the first time I don't care.",
