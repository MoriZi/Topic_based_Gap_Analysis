            "selftext": "Back when I was 14 years old, whenever I was faced with something that really overwhelmed me, I'd have the absolute worst symptoms of an anxiety attack I've ever had in my life; my teeth would chatter, I would shiver severely as if I was very cold, and I'd also cry. It would take over 2 hours and certain methods to calm myself down from these symptoms. \n\nA lot of these attacks happened back when I was going to a school that made me stressed, even other sudden life events during this time made me incredibly anxious, like losing my dad to cancer and everything else. These have affected me so much that if I were to have one at school, I'd always have to go to the counselor's office or library to calm down; the teacher would notice and send me away for a bit. These especially happened *a lot* at school. I changed schools after my mom planned on moving a year after I started high school (where my severe anxiety started), and I calmed down more. It feels like a new life I started in another state.\n\nAnd as of today (I'm 19, will be 20 in two months), anxiety attacks are more rare for me. I sometimes get them, and when I do, they are way more mild. I just wouldn't imagine if I dealt with the same severity of my anxiety attacks today as I did when I was a bit younger. I definitely feel more calm and confident than I was back then. I still get nervous sometimes, but I'm better.",

            "selftext": "Possibly stupid question, I have mild anxiety issues compared to others here but I have attacks occasionally, usually around flying or things like when I was in a mild earthquake while in Hawaii last year. I have been very sick with the flu and have had a rough week, for various reasons. To the point, I worked myself up the other day about it being something worse (no, not corona... already went to doc and know I\u2019m fine but I think all the meds and weird foods were really doing a number on my insides). Anyways, I took just half of a pill (.5mg I believe, not in front of me) and it helped, but today the feelings are just lingering and creeping back in every time I start to feel like myself again. It\u2019s been all morning, I\u2019ve been up for like 6 hours, but my insides feel fine, I can tell I\u2019m improving from being sick (tho not 100%) but I\u2019m still just struggling and don\u2019t want to take more. Thinking if not the meds maybe it\u2019s just lingering from how close I was to having a full-on attack yesterday? Does any of this sound feasible or familiar?\n\nI appreciate any thoughts or conversation. It isn\u2019t the worst I\u2019ve had it and is no big deal compared to what others are going through... I just don\u2019t know why the lingering/creeping back in won\u2019t stop. I know exercises to prevent attacks but apparently don\u2019t have the skills to deal with this low level kind of dread.

            "selftext": "Hello there, I just have a couple questions about l-theanine. \n\nJust a bit of information to start off with my current medications are:\n* Trileptal 600mg\n* Ativan 0.5mg x2 as needed\n\nThe reason I've been looking at something else to help my anxiety is my love for morning coffee. I get really jittery from just a tiny bit of caffeine but it also clears that morning brain fog I have. Typically I won't drink more than one cup on a day off but on my days I work I get a 24 oz black vanilla coffee before work every morning (no cream or sugar, lol I get jittery enough). I was researching nootropics and came across the L-theanine+Caffeine combination from someone in the Nootropics subreddit. Also being a bit of an anxious person reading several people's review of the combination with the same success I wanted to try something I could get my hands on that day.\n\nIt's been about 2 weeks now and I take it everyday and I'm not sure if it's helping with my anxiety or giving me more anxiety in the long run. Mainly because if I don't take it, I can feel a difference in state of mind. While I know it's something any plain jane could buy, I don't want to become dependent on it. At the same time I've also been on the same dosage of meds for about 6 months now and I'd like to cut the Ativan down to 30 a month or 1 a day as needed. \n\nSo...TL;DR: Is it good to take l-theanine everyday? \n\nI like to have a routine so on days I work I've been taking 200mg AM, 400mg lunch, 200mg late afternoon. Also during these 2 weeks I've completely skipped out on feeling the need to take any Ativan so I just haven't taken any...Is that good? Will my psychiatrist think this is a good route to go? \n\nThat's another thing I'm worried about, while I love the l-theanine, it's definitely not an Ativan and I wouldn't want my psychiatrist to completely take them off or see this as self-medicating. My anxiety is super bad some days and working 12 hour shifts in a warehouse make me go crazy sometimes with my thoughts. So I don't completely lose my prescription, lol\n\nBig ramble, sorry.",

            "selftext": "I have a pretty consistent feeling of anxiety(even when alone and not doing anything). So I tend to go to the same places over and over so that eventually it's not so stressful. Recently I've been trying to do low waste and support local businesses more and therefore have been trying new places to see if I can upgrade any of my normal places from linear economy chains to more of a circular economy that helps locals not corporations.\nToday I was at a co-op market that has a bulk bins section and healthier food than the baby Food Lion closest to me(my normal place). As per usual, I got pretty stressed out by not knowing where things were and all the people (and it didn't help it was in a different section of the city so the demographic of people was as different as possible so they were acting differently than strangers in my area). When it was time to go I went to check out and the cashier was pretty much at the same level of anxious as I was and for some reason that made me feel better. Like she is there presumably 40 hours a week and she is still not completely okay with the crowd and everything so my feelings are reasonable being completely new to this environment. And we didn't exchange any words or eye contact because we were both concentrated on the transaction going smoothly and quickly which took some stress of interacting with strangers away. \nI don't know why she was the most memorable part of that trip but she was. Maybe it's because when I see anxious people out and about I feel proud of them and more comfortable at the same time. If they can be there then I can too and no one will think I'm that weird since someone else is behaving the same way. Does this make sense? I used to have a friend that loved going in public with me cause we would both be nervous wrecks but she would just apologize all the time while I was just weird and low key rude and it was always funny in retrospect especially since we weren't insecure just nervous.",

I properly hydrate and don\u2019t have any known deficiencies.\n\nIf I can Explain my dizzy explanation, it\u2019s not standard spins... it\u2019s very subtle, as if I am working out on a boat that is at dock and only rocking the slightest bit. My legs and hands also FEEL like they go numb.. but I know that they\u2019re not numb if I test by touching them. I\u2019m not clenching anything like my fists so I know blood flow should be going there. It almost feels like I\u2019m moving, but my legs are moving separately than I am, pretty weird.\n\nI get migraines with aura\u2019s, and in the past the aura has triggered anxiety, which then snowballs to worse.

I have been using medication for my OCD and yes, it did stopped my intrusive thoughts , but my anxiety and my manic attacks got worse. I got super nervous around adults and I really can\u2019t do anything, I tried to tell her this, but she didn\u2019t give a fuck. \n My grandpa came to visit us, and as always I was nervous so I couldn\u2019t talk with him. She made fun of me ( after she said she wanted to prove she was a good mom to his father) . I couldnt take it so I didnt left my room while grandpa stayed at home. \n I meet with my boyfriend to a little relax, but I return home 30 minutes late than she wanted me to do. After grandpa left, she started to yell at me, that I will die alone just like my father will. She thinks I got no manner, and all of my problems are just bullshit I made. I don\u2019t know what to do anymore, I can\u2019t take living with her, and my father doesn\u2019t own a house or any place to stay. I am stuck here for 2 more years.\n I cant afford a therapiyst, so all i have tons of boxes of prozac. Please show me a way out.",

I become socially exhausted so easily. I cant do this. Everyday I feel anxious. Everyday my head feels like its spinning. This is driving me insane. Going home doesnt feel like going home. I just hide in my room. I close the door and become invisible. Because im so quiet, nobody knows how loud theyre really being. When my door is closed i still hear everything. Even when they talk about me. They keep their doors wide open and think i cant hear. If i open my door it gets quiet. As if i didnt hear everything. Everyone always wondering if im okay because I dont always want to talk But sometimes id be just waking up having to rush to work. I dont think about saying anything. A simple hello is alot of effort for me tbh. You have to read the room and realize that the room is also reading you. I want to be seen when i want to be seen. If im not prepared for it it feels like im being hit with a ton of bricks. My heart drops and i feel a huge wave of discomfort and heat. But the most i can say is just dont have them over every day. :(",
