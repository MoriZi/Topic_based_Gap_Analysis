            "selftext": "I\u2019ve since I can remember have been filled with anxiety and it\u2019s no secret to my family or people who have known me for extended amount of time. I have always felt with this anxiety a lot of guilt which I don\u2019t 100% understand because I could have never even thought of the thing I\u2019m being blamed for and I\u2019ll react guilty because I\u2019m so fucking nervous! I\u2019ll have a million ideas running through my head including how believable is it that I could do that thing! With this guilt comes a lot of defensiveness. I\u2019m defensive with everyone but not always. Meaning it can happen at any time with anyone. I\u2019ve had many people discretely point this out to me. I have also asked a few people very close to me about these things and they simply responded yeah that\u2019s just how you are. But I don\u2019t want to be this way! It\u2019s ruined so many great relationships for me! Including my current relationship with my boyfriends. I am a very emotional person and I have extreme anxiety now, not always in life it\u2019s this extreme but at the moment it is. I have had a lot of my own issues in the past with anxiety depression bipolar whether it was me or a close relative or friend. My boyfriend has bipolar and i think I\u2019m more than understanding about his emotions and swings. I know I have these problems but I don\u2019t think he has the capacity to deal with mine all the time because of his. I truely want to seek out a way to find less guilt for myself! Because with him the situation is so classic. He will get paranoid and blame me for something he thinks could be going on or he thinks he saw happen. I then get overly anxious that he first off could even think this about me and then that he wants to blame me for something with no facts. He has done this so many time it makes me anxious just thinking about it but I think he was testing my responses to see if I still seem guilty. I always feel guilt. He sees me feel the guilt and he thinks I did what he said even if I tell him no. This trait is horrific. I cry so easily. I get overwhelmed very quick. It looks so bad to look guilty and then if someone questions me after I\u2019ve started crying and get emotional it comes off very defensive which doesn\u2019t help me at all. I honestly feel like a weak fucking child every time this happens to me. But I\u2019m so overwhelmed with thoughts that I can\u2019t stop myself, I can\u2019t calm myself down. It very uncomfortable and I\u2019m hopeful someone here has some insight? I just hope I\u2019m not doomed forever because if I didn\u2019t have this issue things would have been so much better, and so different.",

            "selftext": "My 30 year stint with my anxiety cant possibly be summed up as any one thing. My anxiety has certainly altered the course of my life. Ive been on disablitiy since age 19, but it began at the age of 16. The only time i was symotom free was when i had absolutely no pressures.  As bad as it was when i was young, it only got worse the older i got. I was diagnosed w bipolar in my 30s and finally started taking meds for that in my 40s. Ive been on benzos for 20 years. Thats a whole other story which currently i am having to deal with now. I never seemed to get much help when i looked for it so i have been going it alone for quite sometime. I always had good support from friends and family. But as i got older and things changed, i didnt have them to rely on anymore. 2 years ago i lost my mom which was the hardest loss ive ever had to deal with. God gave me grace there but it continues to be a source of lonliness and sometimes anxiety if i think about her too much. My significant other is very sweet, but it really is hard for her to deal with all the time. So im on my own. Literally my whole life has felt like ive been dumped out in the wilderness with nothing to survive on. The isolation gets worse and worse. I pray, read my scruptures. Ive always had a very close relationship w God. But this was something that for some reason he never chose to heal me from. It wouldnt be the first for many believers who face adversity. And this has been how ive done it. Living in a wilderness with only him. Im a singer and songwriter, and i even preach. In alot of ways these afflictions have made me have to grow in other areas. Its been an interesting journey and not a bad life inspite of it all. But there have been many times when i wanted it all to end. These days its been a particularly strong feeling. But i think about the prophet elijah who threw himself under a bush in the desert and asked God to take his life. After 3 years of flying by the seat of his pants,  it took one more incident to push him to that point. And yet God was gentle with him, let him sleep under the brush a while, woke him, fed him. Let him sleep more. Sounded alot like what ive had to go through mamy times in some ways. Eventually he went to meet God who sent him on last minute errunds. But now, its just harder to deal with. My blood preasure goes up when i have panic attacks, and now, thanks to constant elevated stress due to all the maddness this past year, i ended up hooked on extra meds that i am running out of and not sure how to get off of, which before was never an issue for me. It took 2020 to drive me there. All i can do is think its only going to get harder and maybe i need to imbrace the pain and finish this life as strong as i can. My life has seemed sad and ruined because of my mental illness but in a lot of ways, ive learned a lot about people and things and myself. But its been lonly. I have no group. I dont know where to go to find one, the process is too complicated, the county dont really care about the patients. Less than the bare minimum is done, and yet, at least its there. Its been very much been me in this world. Thats my story. Anyone has any commemts, help or suggestions it would be helpful. Thank you n God bless.",

She went to college and got a boyfriend and new friends, and I\u2019m so so proud and happy for her. But those new friends are going to be there today. Her whole family will be there today. Im so anxious I want to throw up just even thinking about being there. I\u2019m even anxious to see my friend, knowing I haven\u2019t seen her in person for months. This is the first big social outing I\u2019ve been invited to in MONTHS, and I don\u2019t think I\u2019m ready. I know I\u2019m not going to go, but I haven\u2019t told her yet. I know I\u2019m going to disappoint her, but I\u2019m literally petrified. I\u2019m going to tell her soon and I think she will understand, I\u2019ve always been open about my anxiety with her.. but I still feel like an absolute failure.

            "selftext": "This problem began ever since I learned the techniques of burping from my cousin, I was 12 years old: it was the winter of 2017. During that time I attended a boarding school with a middle school education that lasted from September 2016 until 2019.\n\nIt was a very tough time for me, I was taunted and bullied almost every week, I was the dump truck for the popularity of others, and it only increased my anxiety which made me belch even more air. The schedule was absurd, every day I only had 20 minutes at most to finish my meal, and no more food was served after that, because they didn't care to bother: the parents aren't around to accuse. I often went hungry, so I would pile as much food as I can and finished eating it before the next activity. But it had impacted negative side effects on my esophageal well-being. To sum it up, don't go to a boarding school when you're 11 years old.\n\nIn the summer of 2019, I was lucky enough to be remove from one hell of a playground, and moved 550km away, where I attend my first high-school, the home environment (not the school, and never the school) assisted me to emotionally relieve myself, but in turn it spiked up my swallowing problems, which was already there to hug me unconditionally.\n\nwOndEr hOw it WenT? On a beautiful sunny day of the October in 2019, exactly half a year after I left that damn school, I regurgitated my food during a tasty cereal breakfast on a freshly fixed lawn; the milk temperature wasn't how my stomach wanted.\n\nUnfortunate events began crumbling after, a month later, I couldn't swallow as properly (not saying that swallowing didn't hurt a year ago) and every bite was like a trip to the ER after breaking your legs from the third floor, nothing helped nor relieved my pain: Medicine (it made the situation worse because of the hard tablets), therapy, special \"fluid\" diets, etc, nope. It gradually went from eating a proper thanksgiving meal with a die-hearted chicken broth in the heaven of 2015, to something that had to be carefully prepared and scheduled or I will die on a hospital bed, nevertheless, those options never benefited me in any way.\n\nI've had a GI done while I was back in China, but they couldn't find anything and weren't convinced that I needed to get a Barium Swallow done. I had \"mysterious\" stomach aches whenever the food lingered in-between my esophagus, and more often than not I would find myself waking up in the middle of the night having to blow my nose with mucus full of what I had ate for dinner. Sometimes I couldn't breathe whenever I had food stuck, and etc, etc. The list goes on for so long I don't even recollect most of them.\n\nFor months, we visited doctors, and somehow none of them recognized that I had Dysphagia. Eventually, we found one, because the symptoms were becoming prominent, and so my father applied the treatment from the Medi-Cal insurance, and we waited. Fast forward to 2020, a year after, the insurance was still pending, as if praying that I would eventually forget about this and leave it alone. Spoilers, we didn't. We called them, and they told us to wait, but we already did. We still haven't found the resolution and I've visited the ER a couple times already.\n\nThere isn't anything special about this essay that I'm doing, I'm writing this because I'm desperate, I really want a solution, I feel suicidal sometimes because of this. The pain is unbearable; a needle poke felt like a gentle pat on head compared to my swallowing issues. Please, I want it to stop :(",

            "selftext": "I \\*think\\* I had my first panic attack yesterday. I was already feeling nauseous for a couple of hours before I started feeling my heart racing. About 20mins in I started worrying because my heart rate wouldn't go down and I feel like the worrying made it worse. Then during my zoom meeting I couldn't stop shaking my legs, my hands/arms started to feel numb, and it was hard to breathe and I think that's when I started worrying I was going to have a heart attack. And I know it might sound dumb but I tried calming myself down by thinking if I have a heart attack mid zoom at least there's someone to call 911 for me. I also tried taking a lot of deep breaths and drink a lot of water but it got to the point I left mid meeting to the bathroom and wash my face and do jumping jacks (yeah sounds dumb but I was doing whatever google said to do). It lasted for over an hour but I was so scared it wasn't going to stop. I texted two friends how I was feeling prior and during but none of them suggested it was a panic attack and told me I was going to be okay so that thought never crossed my mind until I saw someone's post on facebook about symptoms of a panic attack. If I did have a panic attack, I never knew panic attacks were actually this scary because I literally thought I was going to die. Just wanted to put this out on the internet because I mentioned it to my friends and they sorta just brushed the topic over. I've never experienced this in my 20 years of living and I'm scared of it possibly happening again in the future.",

Whenever I meet someone new, they are all surprised with my age since I look 2-3 years younger due to my height and weight(even today). Anyways, that night we had a couple of guests in our house that I haven't met before. My sister was 9 years old at the time and I was 14. One of the guests asked my dad if my sister was the oldest. 5 years guys 5 fucking years. He thought I was younger than her and she was only 9. I've always had low self esteem and at that moment my eyes were filled with tear and I remember the look that my dad gave me. He was pitying on me I felt so humiliated and wanted to leave the room but didn't want to be disrespectful.  I will never forget that look my dad gave me... I hate my body.I hate myself. Why do I even exist. I'm ugly. I don't have a friend from the opposite gender since elementary school. Why? What did I do to deserve this? Anyway, if you are still reading, thank you.",

My mother is the most anxious person I know and I think as a result of learning how to calm her over a lifetime I learned how not to be terribly anxious myself. But my husband has been having bad anxiety about COVID risks and I am at my personal breaking point. We've made so many sacrifices to placate the anxiety but he's asking me to go one step further than I can personally go. I'm drawing a line because it does not need to be done. The risks are so minimal but to him, any risk is enough to make a lifestyle change. How do I help him as we do the thing that makes him anxious? He will continue to be anxious as this is a lifestyle change in the opposite direction he'd like to go.",
