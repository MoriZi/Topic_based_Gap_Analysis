Eventually everyone went kind of their own way and we stopped playing together... except of this one guy that kept being friends with me. One day he gave me some bad gut feeling and I didn't know what it was but I have decided to not contact him as often. This is when he confessed to me. I was never interested in him because he was just not my type and lived far away so the relationship wouldnt have made it. I tried to reject him as politely as I could and give as little reasons why to not hurt him. He said that everything is ok.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe haven't talked for few days and then he started messaging but was sort of creepy. It took me a while because I am bad at comfrontations and said that I think it's not best for us to continue our friendship and this is when he exploded. He was telling me very disturbind things. He began to threaten me with various things and despite blocking him everywhere, he began to harras me through snail mail.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI have closed majority of my accounts as he always found a way to find me. I have changed passwords in remaining very few accounts. I delete and recreate new social media accounts frequently as he have somehow stalked me out and found me (I have pretty unique name and surname so I stopped putting these on my facebook, linkedln is hardest to hide, I can't put a fake name there).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI had gazillion of reddit accounts and always deleted them before they reached my cake day. Now this is the oldest reddit account that I have. Recently I got 3rd follower and it makes me super anxious that guy has found my reddit. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhat about police? Reported several times and they can't take it any further because they don't have enough evidence what makes me absolutely mad!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI just needed to let some steam out",

            "selftext": "I am feeling so incredibly overwhelmed and sad lately, and really need some support or advice .\n\nI started taking 5mg off adderall about a week ago. I find that it has helped stabilize my mood slightly . Overall small improvements.\n\nMy entire life I have struggled with self regulation because of my ADHD and childhood Abuse. Although I am a very functioning person on the outside, I struggle a lot internally. I feel like no matter how hard I try I cannot keep up with life. As of lately I have become even more overwhelmed. I don't normally struggle with depression but I've noticed that I've become more depressed lately. I got some blood work and it was noted that I am low in Vitamin D.\nI feel like I'm stressed about absolutely everything, my job, my relationship , money etc . \n\nMy mood seems to change either daily or hourly . Sometimes it's consistent for a week. One minute I'm motivated getting stuff done , positive about life the next I'm having panicking attacks, crying at work , worrying about absolutely everything.\nIve had this cycle for years although I notice it much more now that I'm in a relationship and live with my partner. \nI'm struggling so much. When I'm not anxious and calm . The things I normally worry about don't bother me as much but when I'm upset everything feels like the end of the world. I can get so overwhelmed that I become suicidal .\nI can't always get to therapy so I try and follow a lot of therapy, psychology , self help pages on Instagram and Facebook . I find them to be somewhat helpful but I feel like I'm getting waaaay too much information and I don't know what to do with it all. \nI try and have a healthy diet, take supplements and get exercise. My job consists of being outside all day ( traffic flagger ). I try so hard to not have any vices ; smoking too much weed, smoking cigarettes, drinking everyday, playing video games everyday, watching YouTube everyday . Sometimes it's so hard though and I wish I could just have 1 glass of wine or I'm stressed or smoke weed. I force myself not to when I'm overwhelmed though because I want to find healthier ways to get through things. I only smoke weed when I'm in a good mood , same with alcohol. I feel like I analyze everything so much to make sure it isn't toxic or unhealthy. I analyze the content I watch/listen , it gets to the point that even if I enjoy watching it, if part of me thinks there are bits that are \"toxic\" I stop watching even if it made me happy. I don't pursue friendships with many people because I can never find people who are \"healthy\" enough and thus I feel lonely. \nI wish I could just live. I wish I could just stop thinking. I can't handle this, I don't know what to do, I'm so scared and overwhelmed. I wish I could stop worrying if things were right or wrong , toxic or unhealthy . \n\nMy boyfriend ( 27 ) has mentioned that this can be normal for my age (21) and that after age 25 I will begin to get better at emotional regulation . He has been incredibly supportive and I love him so much but I'm even getting to the point where I want to break up just so he doesn't have to deal with me and I can just hide away.\n\nI really need help. I don't know what to do anymore, I'm so fucking sick of these cycles. It's like a never ending hell vs heaven . Please help me .\n\nTL:DR: Feeling incredibly overwhelmed, stressed, anxious , sad. I haven't been depressed in awhile and have begun getting depressed. Tired of my emotions bouncing all over the place . I don't know what to do and just need support \ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude25",

He was looking down for a solid 30 seconds, then looked up at me for a split second, then back down at his phone for another little while. \n\nI felt so embarrassed when this happened because I was obviously talking about something very personal. Being shy and introverted I just didn\u2019t know what to say in the moment... I wanted to say \u201care you f*cking kidding me??\u201d Not even my therapist wants to listen to my issues...... He clearly wasn\u2019t listening to a word I was saying because all I was getting was \u201cmmhmm\u201d or just silence. \n\nHas this happened to anyone else? Is this a normal thing for your therapist to be sneaking texts? I found it very inappropriate as I have been seeing him weekly for the past 9 months. I don\u2019t even want to go back now.",

It\u2019s not how I planned it or ideal but I think I\u2019d rather risk a short unemployment than continuing to work under constant anxiety and stress. \n\nI spoke with someone I currently work with and she agrees with my friends that it sounds like most issues stem from my boss not communicating or expecting too much that has been causing issues. I feel vindicated a bit. \n\nI don\u2019t know how I would have gotten through a few incidents without this sub so thank you.

            "selftext": "I had my cat for nine years, I raised her since she was a kitten and she was the cutest, sweetest thing. Last week Wednesday (3 March) she was found dead on the couch by my mom, my brother and me. My baby lied there lifeless and I can't get it out my head. I loved her so much. It was unexplained because she was so healthy, it was so sudden and out of no where and it feels like my heart shattered in pieces. My brother took her to the vet to see what happened and it turns out she had a heart attack during her sleep. I miss her so much, she slept in the bed with me, she was in the bathroom with me whenever I showered and would follow me around to be pet and loved and my god was she the happiest cat ever.\n\nI've always suffered from anxiety, I have anxiety medication but not even that is helping me. My chest hurts constantly, I can barely breathe and I can never sleep or focus. It feels like I am being stabbed in the chest 24/7. I'm behind in my studies because I can't find myself to remember anything I studied, I find it hard to study in general. Exams are hard because my thoughts are all over the place and the stress of failing the exam because of this anxiety makes me feel like I'm about to throw up or pass out. None of it seems real. Every thought of her makes me burst into tears.\n\nHere's a picture of this beautiful baby. The pic was taken a year ago:   [https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-HqWPk5B5ZF0/Xmk-ck2gRsI/AAAAAAAAewk/HPumgxbfPb4RLHuKN8cm2\\_Wlo1B4kLpnwCK8BGAsYHg/s0/2020-03-11.jpg](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-HqWPk5B5ZF0/Xmk-ck2gRsI/AAAAAAAAewk/HPumgxbfPb4RLHuKN8cm2_Wlo1B4kLpnwCK8BGAsYHg/s0/2020-03-11.jpg)",

            "selftext": "I dated my ex gf for 2 years since we where both 15 and 16. It was the perfect relationship, pure love and enjoyment, during the time we dated I had trust issues and was anxious because of it but never really told her, we started having problems around 4 months ago with little stuff like her being always late and both getting annoyed from each other so we both decided to break up sorta \u201ctemporarily\u201d. The thing is she has a friend (a girl) that is helping a guy get with my ex and since my girl and I ended things with getting back together in mind (even going to prom together) I\u2019m scared of losing her, my ex gf keeps hanging out with that guy and his/her friends even when she knows that guy is trying to get with her. I don\u2019t know what she wants anymore. I keep trying to talk to her but I\u2019m just not giving her the space she needs, but I can\u2019t get my mind off her, she has been a main part of my life for 2 years and I\u2019m broke right now. I miss her so much and its only been 5 days, I need to get help because this is killing me. \n\nAny advice?",
