            "selftext": "My family bought me a gift...but I don\u2019t have much use for it. This causes me a lot of guilt and anxiety and sadness.\n\nI guess first world problems...\n\nI just moved out of my mother\u2019s house and got married and have a place of my own. My husband is a gamer, but sticks to consoles. A couple years ago he thought he\u2019d get into PC gaming, but didn\u2019t so he has a REALLY good PC that he built himself. It has tons of storage and like I said, he never got into PC gaming so it\u2019s just been sitting there being used for menial tasks. That\u2019s where I come in. I\u2019m a huge fan of Sims and own from Sims 2-Sims 4 and play it a lot. Right now I\u2019m on my Sims 3 binge so if you know Sims, you know that Sims 3 isn\u2019t an easy game to play.\n\nBut my husband\u2019s computer has it running within 2 minutes and runs really smoothly throughout the game, even with CC and the mods - no lag or anything. This isn\u2019t a problem, again, because he mainly plays his consoles so when we\u2019re doing alone time, I gravitate to the living room with the computer and be gravitates to the bedroom with the consoles. \n\nMy birthday was August 22nd. My mom told me that she was working on a birthday gift that month but that it was running a bit late. No big deal. She gave no hints as to what it could be or anything. I had zero clue what to expect. My family has been struggling financially - especially with my wedding because my mom wanted to do things like buy my dress and help pay for catering or gifts, but has always been well, not great with money. \n\nBut my mom told me that because of money, the gift would be delayed. No big deal. Got married October 3rd, went on the honeymoon and then came back. My mom dropped off my gift today and well, uh, wasn\u2019t expecting it but she gave me a computer that she had her friend build and test...\n\nIt\u2019s not a bad computer as far as I can tell - but my husband\u2019s graphics card alone is 92% better in his words and we have zero need for a second one whatsoever. She said she wanted to give me my own Sims machine and that her, her partner, and my sister all contributed and thought it was the perfect idea, and again, mentioned that it was a lot of money and time put into it. We don\u2019t even really have space for a second one. She said she wanted it to be like a his &amp; hers gift so that my husband and I could do our own things - but again, when he\u2019s on the computer, it\u2019s usually to Google something. He has a few games, but nothing he plays a lot so sharing is not complicated and we just express what we want to do that day and plan accordingly.\n\nShe was so excited and asked if I liked it. I said I did, that I was just really surprised. I\u2019m scared that she could tell that I didn\u2019t like it. Or that if she couldn\u2019t, my sister could.\n\nI actually would have preferred a laptop because he\u2019s been using a laptop for voice over stuff and we broke ours.\n\nI hate gifts, by the way - because I hate the idea of not liking something and disappointing them. This is an on-going internal problem for me - I\u2019m not the best at reactions and I always feel guilty if I don\u2019t like something or love something; especially when people put a lot of time and effort into something. This feels doubly bad because I know how strapped for cash my family can be (even if it\u2019s because they\u2019re not responsible for it) and that a lot of thought and effort did go into this gift. \n\nShe told me that whenever we get it set up, she wants to see it. She even brought over a table and chair because she couldn\u2019t get us a desk.\n\nGuys, I just don\u2019t know what to do. I\u2019m probably going to cry and set it up, take some pictures, and shove it in the closet and only take it out if she\u2019s coming over. My husband says I need to be blunt, but that\u2019s just not in my nature. \n\nThis is causing me so much stress I\u2019m mad that I already had my therapy session for the week because I need to talk about it...",

            "selftext": "So Schizophrenia kind of runs in my family, amongst other mental health problems. One of my sisters has it &amp; my dad's mom had it. I believe I may be starting to develop it maybe? I have a lot of anxiety so I can't tell the difference sometimes. So, I keep making story lines and then I tell someone or think about it later on and it sounds crazy. For example, the other day I was getting gas &amp; right next to my gas station are the pro-life protesters next to an abortion clinic. My friends &amp; sisters have had a few... altercations with them &amp; So when i left the gas station I thought one of them was following me. I went all around way out of my way to get away from that van. Now that I think about it I think they only made 1 same turn as me.. I don't know why I was actually so scared in that moment. Also, when I was smoking weed in my car one night, i kept looking in the mirror and i thought i saw a tall man like in the trees &amp; every now and then i'll think there is someone standing in my peripheral vision. I may just be paranoid i have no idea... but I have noticed I'm more on edge lately or Ill have a sudden feeling on doom/guilt/ like something bad is happening. The last example I had is that I got a sudden feeling like my own sister was trying to set me up and kill me. The thought only lasted for about 1 minute before I was like okay no way. But the scared feeling I got and how I got all this \"evidence\" in my head about how that made sense that she was trying to kill me. I don't know what to think, i'm very scared. I really hope it's not that but I feel like I could have triggered it by using drugs or something? Idk.",

I'm not a small woman and have always avoided photos and mirrors to show me just how horrific I look. Because I'm tired of hating myself and because I can't achieve the same body positivity for myself that I truly feel for others, I'm getting bariatric surgery.\n\nI've already taken time off at work and I'm actually excited about the possibilities. But because of my past with my mother, I cannot figure out a way to tell her that doesn't expose me to her petty backlash, or her trying to convince me I don't understand it. If I don't tell her, I'll feel guilt for life and will eventually burst and it will be bad. If I do tell her, there's a good chance that she'll show up to my house (not in the same state as her) to \"help\" -- which means she will bring her judgement, shaming tendencies, and cruelty with her.\n\nI've been holding on to this fear for months. It's eating away at me and putting me on the edge of panic constantly. Obviously, I have an anxiety disorder. What do I do?",

            "selftext": "So my doctor is very adamant about not having me take Clonazepam every day. She fills my script for 15pills for the month. Which I guess I\u2019m okay with, though I\u2019d really like to have more on deck, just in case. My schedule is all over the place, so I never know when I need to take my meds and that makes it hard to plan out my months worth of meds. I mean, when I have only 15 I really have to use them sparingly. Which is okay, but if something happens on one of the \u201coff\u201d days, it messes up the pills I do have for the rest of the month. My anxiety is unpredictable. I\u2019m getting overwhelmed trying to ration them... I would feel so much better having extra, just so I know I have the option in case something happens. I don\u2019t need to take them everyday, But I\u2019d rather have some left over instead of stressing out about running out. \n\n\nAlso, It\u2019s been a little over two months now, and I don\u2019t feel like 0.5mg is helping as much anymore. I know it\u2019s the lowest dose, but I\u2019m afraid if I ask for an increase on top of asking to be scripted more monthly doses she\u2019ll think I\u2019m drug seeking. I\u2019m new to anxiety meds, but I know the stigma against benzos. But I see so many other people being scripted 30 pills a month, and sometimes even more for those who take it daily. I\u2019m just frustrated. She\u2019s very against taking it daily, but I don\u2019t feel like things are working the way they should. I have anxiety daily, so why shouldn\u2019t I be taking anxiety meds daily?? I just don\u2019t get it....",
