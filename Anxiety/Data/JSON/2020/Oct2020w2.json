Felt amazing the day after stopping, but then about 1am that night started to feel the adrenaline rushing and being completely on-edge and hyper-aware. Took a quarter of my 50mg tablet at about 2am and started to chill out a little bit, but couldn't sleep til 7am. \n\nSpoke to my doctor today and asked him for Propranolol to stop the physical effects while I wait for an appointment with a psychiatrist. Just wondering if they'll actually help my brand of anxiety? It's non-situational. I can just be sitting in my office like I have been for a couple of hours then suddenly feel a tinge at the back of my throat and descend into panic.",

            "selftext": "Hello, I am a long time lurker of this sub and I decided to post here, because I suffer from daily anxiety and honestly I am so exhausted of it. I can't seem to move on?\n\nIt began back in December, on the third...I was at school and I got this chest pain on the left side and I freaked out when googling because I seriously thought it was a heart attack! I freaked out so much that I became a little lightheaded in class and so my teacher called security to come and get me to the office, so my dad could take me home because I felt sick and dizzy, and couldn't breathe. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAfter that experience I couldn't go to school, and I vomited every time I ate. I became ill, weak and lost weight. I would scream for my parents to take me to the doctor every day  because I legit felt I was gonna die. \n\nThis lasted until Feburary, I think...though I did have two doctor visits in March but that wasn't really part of it. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut its October now, I can't seem to move on? Every time I start to go back feeling a bit normalcy, the anxiety spikes again and I feel unsafe and vunerable again. And it's ruining my relationship with my parents. My mom is frustrated at me, she's always angry that I can't just \"grow up\" because I am eighteen and I shouldn't act like this, cause its not normal for my age.  The doctors I went too also called me \"attention-seeking\" and \"oversenstitive\".\n\nI don't know what to do anymore, I can't see a pyschologist cause of the pandemic. I am always crying because I feel so bad everyday.  Sometimes I question if its really real or maybe I am just faking it to get attention, like everyone says. I feel like a coward..\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSorry for the long rant...I just wanted to get it off my chest.  No one really wants to hear how I felt, people tend to shrug it off in if I tell them what happened, because it isn't a big deal..i guess.\n\nIf anyone has coping methods that would be very helpful. Again sorry for the long wall of text.",

            "selftext": "So I have severe complex anxiety problems and panic disorder. I have not taken diazepam since March and when I did use them I never abused them and took very little. Now I'm asking him for one or two tablets to be on standby in case of emergency. My grandma is sick, 2 heart attacks within the past 4 years and shes been eating from a feeding tube in her stomach for god knows how long now. I fear that one day she might be rushed into the hospital again and I feel I'd be so disabled by the anxiety that I already have and the anxiety from the situation that I wont be able to go and see her. She is 86 any medical emergency could be it at this age. My anxiety is bad to the point of some days even struggling to go down and microwave my meals without being hit by panic. Just an example. My therapists reaction to me saying this is that is a hypothetical situation and that giving me ONE tablet would be a coping mechanism. I feel like this is a genuine worry, and its not only this one thing I asked for the backup medication for it could be any kind of emergency that pops up and these things do happen. Also all of my anxiety and panic stems from waiting for a panic attack like my first real bad one to happen again, I asked for the backup medication that my mum could keep on her if I really needed it if it were to happen again. I try to argue that I fear I would take an overdose in that situation because I would be so overwhelmed which I have done in panic attacks in the past. He argued that its all just hypothetical anxiety and that I don't need a backup tablet or two. It makes me feel like everything I say has no meaning because its just seen as my anxiety talking and not me being genuine about how I'm feeling and what I'm worrying about.\n\nI'd like to know how other people feel about this. To me its ridiculous, I'm asking for a single dose that someone close to me could keep if I REALLY needed it. I feel being this strict with medications for people that have real problems does nothing but promotes them sourcing these things in other ways.",

I\u2019m on gabapentin 600mg x2 daily for pain.\nI\u2019ve recently discovered that having untreated ADHD, Depression, cptsd and anxiety has led to my body literally turning on itself. I get so tense that my muscles involuntarily start to spasm causing shooting pain all over my body. (Imagine having sciatica nerve damage but all over)\nI first was under the impression my body was becoming inflamed and I was dying. I would stress over it so hard because I\u2019ve visited a ortho and a neuro doctor and they both could not figure out what was going on and why i was feeling what I felt. \nIt would start in my inner thigh (an unbearable Charlie horse feeling) then it radiate to my shoulders and jaw. I would CONSTANTLY be popping and cracking and it would go on all day. It\u2019s been 4 months of constantly being uncomfortable and basically bed ridden.\nThis past weekend, I had a get away with my fianc\u00e9 for her 25th bday... I got us a hotel on the top floor over seeing Waikiki beach (Oahu)... that weekend, it was the first time I was away and relaxed since my medical shit happened and guess what? NOT ONCE WAS A SPASMING OR STIFFED OUT IN PAIN.\nMaking that note, I realized how much I\u2019ve dissociated and how stressed out I was. The moment my mother called, the spasms started to happen. I laid on my back and rolled back and forth with my eyes closed. I did my best to not think of the pain but rather... how nice the bed felt, the smell of the room, the noise of the bed sheets rustling... the pain stopped.\nI\u2019m cutting off my gabapentin (tapering off) and trying to take a more holistic control of what\u2019s happening to my body. I\u2019ve been doing good, but after 4 days of doing good, I found myself falling into the spasms and not being able to think myself out of it. It\u2019s CONSUMING in a negative way where I\u2019m now getting chest pain(started today)...\n\nLong story short... I NEED TIPS. \nWhat do you do to calm down? \nWhat do you do when you\u2019re having panic attacks and there\u2019s nothing you can pin point that\u2019s triggering it?\nDoes enough sleep help? \nHow do you turn your thinking off?\nHow to you become more aware and mindful?",

            "selftext": "Hello, I  was just wondering if I could get some advice really.\nI work as a tattoo artist. I love my job and have worked hard to get where I am however It can be quite overwhelming with the workload and pressure to continue doing my best work time and time again. My confidence is very easily shattered and it often snowballs into anxiety and depression until I brake down and have to take time off work. I am currently taking setraline to keep me on track and have been advised to find work somewhere else if tattooing is causing me so much anxiety. As I said before I do love my job and would be heartbroken if I had to give it up.\n\nI have tried to cut back my work load and give myself Thursdays, Sundays and Mondays off work so I have time to keep on top of admin work such as drawing designs and replying to emails. This is working out really well for me and I feel a lot more in control. I can't help but feel guilty about taking the extra day for myself. Although I am self employed I feel that I'm letting people down and that people will think I'm lazy. I realise I may be over thinking this but it keeps going through my mind and I can't seem to shake it. I was wondering what other people think about the subject? Thank you in advance.",

I've been with my boyfriend for 4 years and have a very stable, loving, understanding relationship. We own a house together and a cat and a dog. \n\nHe has 2 older sisters and his mother. They are all very nice and welcoming to me. But in my head they hate me and think I am not good enough for him. Any comment they make, I spin it to be horrible and negative about me. This turns into debilitating anxiety - panic attacks and episodes that can last from 1 hour to 3 days. I am struggling to get over this anxiety and lack of confidence in myself. Has anyone experienced somethinf similar or have any advice? \n\nI am in therapy and take Lexapro for anxiety. TIA",

I can just feel the immense tightness and weight of it all bearing down on my chest. My brain feels so tight from all my conflicting thoughts and feeling insane for my overthinking slippery slopes. Almost to unbearable. I\u2019ve made an appointment for the therapist. However, it\u2019s not till early November and I am in a bad spot right now. It\u2019s really manifested itself in my marriage. My husband knows I struggle with it bad and has been very generous and patient. However with this peak, I believe he\u2019s hitting his limit of bearing through all my slippery slope overthinking accusations and constantly having to reassure me it\u2019s all in my head. Which in return, I am having a massive panic attack about that. I don\u2019t want my marriage to end over my anxiety when I\u2019m this close to my appointment. I know my anxiety is my issue, but he doesn\u2019t help. He will leave details out when I ask him things or not mention things or leave things out when I ask vague questions, to the point where I have to be extremely specific about things and I\u2019m constantly thinking well was I specific enough or was there a loop hole. Why didn\u2019t he mention it, is he trying to hide something? I don\u2019t know how to cope until my appointment though. Should I just stop being some burden of stress to him and take a break from talking to him till then? should I tell him the marriage for whatever reason is the main source for my anxiety? Help please I feel like such at a loss. So frustrated that brain is arguing against itself and logic. It\u2019s just really taking a toll on my right now and sending me only a swirl of despair.",
