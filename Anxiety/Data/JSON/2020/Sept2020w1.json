I started getting panic attacks almost daily, some extremely violent and scary. It's forced me to work from home since then.\nI've been going to therapy and I've been prescribed Xanax for my panic attacks. I've made great progress: at first, I couldn't get out of my house, but recently, I went on a ten days vacation.\nBut recently, my boss kept pressuring me, so I told my doctor I felt ready to go back to work. I actually kinda felt ready. I was still having attacks, but that was nothing compared to earlier.\nEver since I've made that decision, everything's gone to shit. The panic is back. I lost my appetite (again).\n\nI have to go back to work tomorrow. I do not feel ready at all anymore. I'm so fucking scared I can't stop crying. I just want to call in sick, but I'm scared of what my boss and colleagues will think (I know I shouldn't care), and I'm scared that I could actually be fine and that I'm just exaggerating to convince myself to skip work. I just want to stop being an adult for some time and stay home to relax.\n\nI don't know what to do. Just wish they would let me keep working from home, but that's a big no-no for them.\n\nI hate it here.",

            "selftext": "First of quick summary of me. I was in therapy for the last two months and have a break now. Therapy starts again next week but for now I'm by myself.\nI got a diagnosis and anxiety certainly is a Symptome. I always tend to overthink, but what I've noticed is that my problems are always worse in the morning. Plus occasional anxiety attacks at any given time of the day. But as I said right when I wake up I am ALWAYS anxious.\n\nIt's not that I've got anything to do that day. In fact I got nothing to do for weeks now. No work, no school. But when I wake up I suddenly get anxious for no reason. My heart starts pounding, I can't think straight and I certainly can't think rationally anymore. I seriously get afraid of everything I can think about. I once panicked because I just thought about how I bought my pc a few years ago. I was lying there like \"oh my God you spent x amount of money on the PC\" even though I never regretted buying it for a single second in my life. I also tend to worry about relationships, day structure, completely neutral things I did in the past and so on. Everything I can imagine makes me afraid in some way. These were just a few examples on how absurd my anxietys can get.\n\nDoes anyone else here experience this too? Does anyone have a solution? Thanks in advance for the answers.",

            "selftext": "10th grade, Aged 15. The school year when my mental health had reached its lowest point ever in my life. The school year started off okay but i noticed that I was ignored/abandoned with friends from time to time. I ignored it. I wasn\u2019t too close with my siblings to open up and talk about it. My parents were too busy mostly because my grandma was in the hospital at the time. That was until I started feeling very lost, upset, unwanted, full of fear, and felt so alone. All of this created something I never wanted. For days I felt like I couldn\u2019t breathe, sleep, smile, my body felt numb due to the tingling sensation, chest pain, heart palpitations, and I constantly felt cold which made me believe that I had a fever so I took a lot of pain killers. Nothing helped. I went to urgent care only to get yelled at to stop taking pain killers and to be told that nothing was wrong. The symptoms persisted. No one knew what was wrong. I couldn\u2019t handle it anymore. Thankfully my grandma got out of the hospital so my mom wasn\u2019t as stressed, but she got rly worried when my symptoms wouldn\u2019t go away so she took me to the emergency room which made me feel 100x more scared. I waited 6 hours in that dreadful emergency room only to be told that I have Anxiety. My \u201cfriends\u201d didn\u2019t care. I tried making new friends but that made things worse. They also didn\u2019t care about my mental health. Joined wrestling to get my mind off things. It was great! I was active, gained some pounds, learned new things, but I didn\u2019t rly make many friends bc everyone already knew each other and I had to quit bc of an injury and got surgery during the summer. So there I was, alone and bed ridden in pain physically and mentally. I lost 12 lbs, I lost my smile, and I lost who I was. I felt worthless. No one knew that I was going through this. Everyone I told kept ignoring me so I thought I was just crazy. I made online friends and they brought back my smile which I greatly appreciate, but we don\u2019t talk as much anymore due to busyness and time zones. My parents didn\u2019t and still don\u2019t know how my anxiety emerged. I will tell them when I\u2019m ready.\n\nIn my senior year my anxiety attacks have gone from an everyday thing to now only being once a month. The only symptoms I get nowadays is hyperventilation, heart palpitations, and restlessness. Decent progress.\n\nI went to therapy in my 1st year of university, but my therapist said all of this was \u201cbullsh-t drama.\u201d I felt pathetic and I never went back to that sh-tty therapist ever again. \nI just started my 2nd year of university. I have friends (met them in our 1st year) but I\u2019m still the third addition/wheel of the group (4 years in a row) it\u2019s always been horrible and the friendships never last because I leave due to being constantly ignored even after I told them about it. I have a boyfriend that I\u2019ve been dating for a year now and I do consider him to be my best friend, but it saddens me because we cannot see each other often due to different schools and the virus. I\u2019m happy that he has his own best friend and group of friends and doesn\u2019t have to go through what I have been going through. Except we do not have much in common. I have never had a friend that has had more than 1 thing in common. I have gotten busier including my college friends and I can\u2019t make new friends due to the virus and online learning. I plan to transfer to another university but who knows if I\u2019ll even be able to set foot on the campus. Not giving up on making friends and I\u2019ll continue to conquer my anxiety! Advice is greatly appreciated :,).",

I come downstairs this morning and I notice that the pull out bottom freezer is thawing and I hear strange fan noises. This fridge is only 4 months new. The ice bucket is half water, frozen pizza are soft, cardboard boxes are soggy from water. I immediately took out my phone and ran a diagnostic, said it was ALL good, no problems.  My thought it\u2019s probably on a standard defrost cycle. But the strange fan noise from the back is worried me. I then got out the manual from the draw and called the help line. Because of CV, I\u2019m  on hold for over an hour with no one answering after talking to someone initially for 5 minutes. I hang up and ponder what will I do if the fridge is truly broken. There not an exorbitant amount of food but enough that it would be a waste and loss to lose it to spoilage. Anyway 2 hours later, I go back and I can hear the ice maker working and the food is starting to freeze again. So it WAS a defrost, but I don\u2019t need this problem along with everything else going on.",

Last school year (my first year teaching public school) I had the same anxiety but just powered through it and despite the praise and recognition I got for a particularly good first year, I felt like it would all fall apart any minute and people would discover I\u2019m not capable at my job and give it to someone else. Today is a parent meet and greet(socially distanced). I\u2019m terribly anxious, and I didn\u2019t sleep well. Luckily I don\u2019t feel like this all day every day. Once I got into the groove at work I felt so amazing and happy to be there. I just get nervous and big staff meetings or places I feel socially confined. I also get nervous around authority figures.

            "selftext": "Two weeks ago a colleague of mine quit. I was told I had 3 weeks to learn everything I could off them and then I would be replacing them in their role (which they had mastered over the course of 3 years).\n\nNeedless to say, my anxiety was through the roof. But I was determined to eat, sleep and breath the job, working into the evening and on weekends.\n\nIt became clear to me that I didn't have what it takes for the role. I was in dire need of upskilling, but there just wasn't time. I started to become physically ill, had trouble sleeping and recurring nightmares.\n\nThis all came to a head last Saturday, I had a nervous breakdown and wanted to kill myself. My partner made an appointment with the only doctor who was open on a Saturday near us.\n\nThe doctor was an older man, and it was probably the worst experience I've ever had with a doctor in my life. My partner came in with me and I couldn't stop crying from the get go. Some of his nuggets of wisdom included:\n\n\"How can you be upset with such a pretty girl here with you?\"\n\n\"Don't you know how many people would kill to have such a pretty girl by there side like you do?\"\n\n\"I had a patient with renal cancer in here last week, your lucky not to be in his position!\"\n\n\"You know in Japan they are so work obsessed they top themselves over the smallest things?\"\n\n\"You aren't only ruining your life, but this pretty girl's life too!\"\n\n\\*slaps me on the shoulder\\* \"cheer up!\"\n\nBy the end, he could see how frustrated I was. So he prescribed me some anti-depressants and sleeping tablets.\n\nThat Sunday, I wrote a two page statement that I read to HR the following Monday morning. The HR lady was very understanding. She recommended I take the day off and  visit my regular doctor. \n\nI did that and my regular doctor gave me some numbers for therapists and gave me a sick certificate for the week.\n\nI spent Tuesday on the couch watching the Bill &amp; Ted trilogy.\n\nYesterday I went to visit my parents. I was scared what they would think of the whole situation as I never went on anti-depressants before. \n\nIt was then my mother revealed to me something I never knew. She has been on anti-depressants herself for 6 years when I was a kid. She had to take 7 months off work and could barely leave the bed. I was only 2 when I started so I have no memory, but it shocked and humbled me to hear. It really put things in perspective.\n\nI'm to go back to my doctors next Monday to see if I need more time off work. The anti-depressants have left me feeling dosed, sleeping a lot and with no appetite. \n\nI'm scared for what awaits me when I get back to work. I've purposely been avoiding my emails as I don't want to see anything that triggers my anxiety. My colleague will be gone at the end of this week and I don't know if they have found anyone else to fill his shows. My biggest fear when I get back is that nothing will change and I'll have to pick up from where I left off, leading to another breakdown.\n\nThanks for reading. Not sure why I felt the need to write this. Weird times.",

            "selftext": "As the title says, when I go away without my boyfriend for a weekend, a week, however long, I get bad anxiety. I'm super anxious with the days leading up to when I'm supposed to leave, and sometimes go as far as to cancel my trip. I have general anxiety on a day to day basis, but whenever I leave for extended periods it just exacerbates it that much more. The things I get anxious about range from semi-plausible to full on ridiculous (ex: \"He's going to have so much fun without me around (fear of missing out)\" \"He's going to cheat on me\" \"I'm going to get into an accident/something bad will happen to him\" \"He's letting me use his car, is he enabling me so he can do something bad??\"). I find myself checking social media, seeing if he's online more often too as a way to \"stay connected\" (even if I don't message him).\n\nI have a trip planned to see my dad for the long weekend coming up. I've been mulling it over for the last few days and almost at the point of looking for excuses to not go and stay home (\"Oh it might rain!\"). But every time I've done that, I just sit at home bored thinking how I gave up on my plans to do basically nothing at home with my boyfriend. What can I do to cope and ultimately silence the anxious rambling in my head, so that I can happily live my life without this constant dread?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFor a bit more info: I'm 30F, my boyfriend is 33M, living together for 1.5 years, together for 8.
