CBT has helped me manage my triggers and has been insanely helpful, but I still have sudden intense flashbacks, nightmares, or times where CBT techniques fail. And so, I use a Xanax, and I\u2019m able to work through whatever I need to work through. It works, it helps, and I only use it when I absolutely need to. \n\nEVEN SO every. Single. Time. I see a doctor or have to refill the Xanax Rx, they make me feel like sh*t for even using it in the first place. They lecture me on how I shouldn\u2019t depend on it, how it\u2019s harmful, etc and it makes my anxiety skyrocket. Once, it even prolonged a panic attack because I was terrified of using Xanax even though I absolutely should have. \n\nI KNOW not to abuse it; I KNOW it\u2019s not a long term solution and I\u2019m not trying to make it one. But it legitimately helps me when I need help in between me finding an alternative. Stop making me feel like an asshole for using something that helps me.\n\n(Want to make it clear I\u2019m not bashing on SSRIs/SNRIs; they are wonderful for so many people.

            "selftext": "Very unsure if my case is enough for me to be diagnosed with anxiety. I don't want to self diagnose, but I'm unsure wether or not to reach out to a psychologist.  My days are usually very on and off, some days I don't stress a lot, while some days I'm anxious about a lot of things. Some days I feel like I could be in public events and talk a little bit and not thinking about wether or not I'm going to come off as wierd, quiet or shy. But 9/10 times I'm constantly anxious about how I look, how I come off, what to say and what to do. Having presentations is way too hard for me and it has been like that since 9th grade (2 years). I started asking my teachers and I got permission to never have presentations again since I usually skipped school if they presented a video where I was in it or if I had a presentation. One recent example was that a good friend of mine was going to game a board game night where me, him and like 5 girls which I have barely ever talked to form my class were going to play board games etc. I knew I shoul say yes, but I just couldn't push myself. I am aware that my fear is irational, but I just can't help it. I NEED to push myself out of my comfort zone, but I just can't.\n\nI know this is poorly written, I just wanted to put this out there as fast as possible.",

            "selftext": "I have suffered with anxiety, depression, and chronic pain for ~15 years now. It got so bad in High School, that I just flat out refused to go most days (I did end up graduating thanks to online classes). I've basically been a hermit since I was ~15 years old, I'm 27 now. I've been on disability since I was 18, and I lived with my parents until I was 23.\n\nTo make a long story short, when I moved out on my own I was forced into doing things for myself, interacting with people everyday, and taking care of myself. I still hate interacting with people, and I sometimes still have anxiety attacks afterwards, but for the most part I'm okay. During interactions, I'm able to carry a conversation and act normal. All of this, coupled with forcing myself to take trips by myself to see my (long distance) boyfriend, I feel like I've forced my anxiety down several notches.\n\nNow that things are manageable (though I still get deeply uncomfortable), I find myself becoming impatient with friends who talk about their anxiety issues. I sympathize with them, and I get how they feel, but I get irritated when they say they *can't* do something.\n\nI've been trying really hard to encourage my friends to do things for themselves, despite how hard it is for them. I know how hard it is to deal with anxiety, and I know brute force doesn't work for everyone, but it did for me. I want to see my friends get better. Looking back at myself all those years ago, I see now how coddled I was. My mom did everything for me if my anxiety was too much. If I'd just pushed myself a little harder, things would've been different so much sooner.\n\nIt's so frustrating to hear a friend talk about how he refuses to stand up for himself with his parents, or how another friend printed a bunch of 3D stuff for a local con to sell but then wouldn't go and sent her sister instead. Or how another friend is nearly 35 and still living with her parents, despite being able to afford living on her own. Or how another friend can't keep a job for more than a few days because of her anxiety. \n\nSometimes I want to tell them to just get over themselves and just *do* it. Which is somewhat funny to me, because I hated hearing that when my anxiety and depression were at their worst. I know it's hard, but I fully believe now that if you do push through it, it gets better. If you don't try, nothing will ever change!",

            "selftext": "I have anxiety, i always have, but i never realised until i went to uni. Im a quiet kid but ive consistently maintained a few good friends throughout my life. University flipped my life upside down. I met many people throughout the first couple weeks but found it incredibly hard to keep up with them. I didnt go to lectures either.\nI am now in second year and dont talk to any of the people i met and hung out with in 1st year. I cant go to lectures because i am terrified that people are going to judge me. I am boring and weak to everyone around me, even to my housemates who all do their own thing now.\nIt all comes down to the fact that I am anxious of everything and i cant stop overthinking my flaws and inability to speak up when interacting with people. It stops me from going out because i know ill just be my weird self in that situation. I wasnt like this before uni, i was content being who i was. But now im more aware of who i am, I can see my flaws and cant stop thinking about them when im with people!\nI think i am a covert narcissist, i think i am autistic, i think i have bpd, but everyone keeps telling me im fine.\nScientifically, the reality is that my anxiety has caused me to act differently, such as jumble my words, which has reinforced my negative thinking and made me believe i am a awkward/boring person to the point where i act like one.\nYet i still fall into the same thought patterns and behaviours.\nIt seems like the only way to escape anxiety is to not give a shit about anything because i cant seem to find a balance.\n\nSo my question is: How do you stop thoughts about your flaws from getting in the way of living a normal life and talking normally to people when they make themselves known all the time?\n\n-I havent tried medication, only counselling which is bs imo",

There is lots of research about it, so look into it if you're curious. Anyways, back when I was taking it, I thought it was helping, but I ran out and forgot to buy more and life went on. Anyways, my anxiety has been out of control since this fall. Probably the worst it's been in my life. I don't want to drive, I feel anxious in any social situation, I can't go to church at all, anymore... doing basic things like showering and housework felt completely overwhelming to me. You get the idea.\n\nAnyways, my husband reminded me that we both used to feel better when we were taking it, so I started taking it. I have to say that I have been more productive in the week since I started taking it than I have in months. I'm caught up on laundry, I'm working on some house renovations, and I feel happy and calm. I just wanted to share that this is something that has truly helped me. I know everyone is different, but maybe this will help someone else! &lt;3",

Especially with the idea that a lot of people i know will also see it. A colleague of mine posted a photo of me in her stories; just sitting and talking to someone and i felt so cringy seeing it.
