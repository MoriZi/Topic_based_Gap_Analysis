However, I don't consider as being stressed right now. I have a history of being stressed/anxious but those past months it's like I only have physical symptoms. Does it happen to you too? It feel like I am in a loop of having shortness of breath because of anxiety which make me anxious and so on. Or maybe it is a accumulation of years of stress/anxiety which explode now?\n\nDeep breathing/ mediation is not helping but I may expect too much, too fast. I tried 4 weeks sertraline (50mg) but I ended up to the hospital because of hyperventilation nocturnal attack.\n\nThank you",

It\u2019s a small business so my boss is really struggling to make ends meet. He\u2019s still been running the office for people who on the off chance do need materials. So when he gets these small orders he deals with most of it himself but sometimes he has to enlist someone to help out if it\u2019s out of his wheelhouse. \n\nSo far I believe I\u2019ve been one of the very few people he hasn\u2019t asked for anything, even though I run a department. I don\u2019t know why he wouldn\u2019t be asking me questions or looping me in on what\u2019s going on. I\u2019m worried he won\u2019t end up bringing me back on once we can open again. \n\nBefore we left he said to everyone that since the economy will be shit after all this, he may only be able to bring back totally essential people at first until they get some money coming in so he can actually pay all of us. I just worry that he doesn\u2019t think I\u2019m essential enough to bring back at all. It\u2019s a really horrible feeling because I\u2019ve put a lot into this job and these people are like family. I\u2019m hurt that it seems like everyone else has had to opportunity to help and prove their worth, whereas I haven\u2019t gotten anything... I really don\u2019t understand, because I\u2019ve asked them time and time again to let me know if there\u2019s anything I can do at all, even off paper. I\u2019ve made it abundantly clear. \n\nI don\u2019t know if I\u2019m just being insecure and reading too much into it because I\u2019ve literally only had time on my hands to obsess. I\u2019ve spoken to other close coworkers about it and they think that he\u2019s just trying to bug as little people as possible and only enlisting who he absolutely needs to. I understand that my department isn\u2019t a huge one and he can do most of what I do - it just makes me feel so insignificant. I don\u2019t know if I did something wrong or if he just doesn\u2019t like me... I\u2019ve reached out to him a few times and asked him if he needs anything and he hasn\u2019t gotten back.

By listening to a song that reminds you of an old friend?\n\nI've thought of the idea to create a room through [JQBX.fm](https://JQBX.fm) where everyone experiencing those lonely 2am thoughts could come together and play some of our favorite music, to remind us that we aren't alone. To remind us there's people going through the same things, at the same time, all together in one space.\n\nWe could talk in the chat and everyone can talk about what the songs they play mean to them.\n\nDoes this sound look a good idea?

            "selftext": "My partner has told me how they felt everyday and I really want to help, in any way. I don't know what it is exactly, so to look up information on it, I don't know what to look for. I know I am not in any position to make a diagnostic, but I am only looking for a way to get a little more information. So I am asking in this subreddit if anyone can identify with what he has told me and tell me something that you would like someone you love to do, or stop doing. (excuse my english by the way)\n\nHere goes. He gets angry very easily, but always, always makes an effort to control agressivity. He is constantly thinking that he HAS to be the best in everything, better than everyone, and gets really irritated when someone who did the same as he did it better. He knows this, hides it, but can't control the feelling. This is present in every aspect of life: sex, work, and in conversations, he always turns it to himself, even when the other person sometimes has something important to say. He also rarely really listens to anybody. He know all this and hates it. It came to a point when I, while not yet knowing this, got a bit mad for some things and told him. A day after, he told me that after the conversation, he cried like he hadn't in years and was so angry at himself to the point of some mild (\"mild\" depending on your experience) self-harm. \"I was almost about to spend the whole night kicking a tree outside.\", he told me.\n\nAnd this worries me, and I don't know how to get better information on the subject, because when I look up anxiety, it's not exactly what I find on websites. He is a nervous person, he is insecure and NEEDS to be the best, he NEEDS to stand out, and he gets angry easily because of the minor competitivity or annoyance. (I should note that we never had a fight, and on the very rare times he shouts he is immediately sorry). And when I look up 'anger', I feel it's also a bit off.\n\nI should note as well that he suffered from anxiety as a kid because of bullying and when things get very very bad, he still has panick attacks, but hasn't had in around a year.\n\nI don't know if this is relevant or not, but with me being a relatively calm person, when he gets irritated or angry I always switch to a really calm and slow voice and try to understand what he's feeling (doesn't mean I always succeed ahah).\n\nI really really want to help, and being in isolation isn't the best. So if anyone has some advice out there, it'd really be appreciated :)",

A month and a half ago if you would\u2019ve asked me how my anxiety everyday and panic attacks were i would\u2019ve said awful. I would cry I couldn\u2019t sleep I was freaking out day in day out. Saw a good doctor who\u2019s now my pcp and got help. I was on different medications in the past, i\u2019m 23 and they didn\u2019t help just made me gain 55 lbs. I\u2019m on celexa and i appreciate everyone\u2019s opinions on the medication it\u2019s self whether good or bad. I\u2019m only on 10mg, he wanted me to bump it up to 20mg about 4 weeks ago but 10mg is working good for me. I\u2019ve had one little panic attack since starting the medication and that\u2019s about it. Sure I get my weird thoughts, but I feel \u2018better\u2019. Not 100%, but getting there. He wanted me to feel about 10 being the worst he wants by around a 5 by now and i\u2019d say it is. I have horrible health anxiety, i don\u2019t have any diagnosis other than anxiety / panic i don\u2019t have any serious health issues with my organs ect but it\u2019s heart health even though it\u2019s been testing i\u2019m a non smoker non drinker i eat healthy i exercise and i\u2019m losing the weight effexor put on me i guess i\u2019m here because what was driving me insane when i first saw the doctor was the heart palpitations. They didn\u2019t hurt and weren\u2019t accompanied by pain but startled me. I got them first in November and went to the ER unsure of what it was they said benign heart palpitations but said it\u2019s safe and okay and they go away and can\u2019t kill me. Otherwise my hearts healthy and he said they found just a couple. However my new doctor reviewed the EKG the last doctor took at the ER and said my hearts good and blood pressures good thyroids good all that. He did see a couple palpitations but said it\u2019s normal. I guess to me it didn\u2019t feel normal because i never felt them before november 2019. My only thought to this current date is that celexa 10mg is helping so much but i still get random palpitations here and there. Not a ton but if i do sometimes i can blow it off and sometimes i get super nervous. Will they ever go away? I was born with it they started not even a year ago. Also along side with my medicine i\u2019ll start speaking with a psychologist here in the next couple weeks! any information is helpful or maybe your journey to success too! i read every answer and response and take all advice to heart!",

I notice that if I am tense, anxious or sitting in one spot for an extended period of time, my heart will begin beating quickly. That is less common though. If I perhaps, go up a flight of stairs once, my heart will begin racing. It has to be built up tension...especially since the gym is closed after going EVERY night, lifting heavy weights. I went outside to play basketball with my neighbors today and my heart did begin racing in the beginning, but ceased beating quickly about 5 minutes in and started beating normally, even though I was still running around and engaging in vigorous exercise. I can run forever and do not get winded. I feel amazing afterwards.\nCould it have been just anxiety?\nAlso, I've had an EKG and 2d Echo done last year and they both showed normalcy.",

For example, \"this too shall pass\" or \"I am safe\".   \n\nThere is also the theory of determinism which can be defined as \"a philosophical\u00a0belief that all events, including human action are determined completely by previously existing causes\".\n\nI find determinism interesting just as a theory.  However, it also seems to have potential as a sort of mantra that can help shift some of the blame we place on ourselves for our actions.  \n\nHowever, this can have the negative affect of dismissing personal responsibility or even suggesting powerless over future choices.  \n\nIf anyone understands what I'm getting at, I am curious your thoughts.  Is there a compromise between a kind of determinism and free will that can be made so that a mantra emerges?  \n\nAlso, any tips on feeling less regret and rumination over past action or inaction would be appreciated.",

I started seeing her, but we didn\u2019t talk about exposure therapy at all, and I didn\u2019t feel like I was doing any better, so I stopped seeing her. I haven\u2019t really found that talk therapy has ever helped me.\n\n\nI\u2019m supposed to see the doctor again in a month. Do you think that with my symptoms, I could go on medication?

            "selftext": "Hi all,\n\nHave any of you dealt with anxiety when it comes to hanging out with friends? This isnt super relevant right now considering we can\u2019t see people...but even on zoom meetings, I get so much anxiety hanging people who I consider to be some of my closest friends. There\u2019s always just a lot of energy and stuff going on that I tend to panic and I end up thinking really negative things in my head. I have to fight to keep negative thoughts out but it\u2019s tough and tiring! I tend to feel worse after I try and fail to hang out with friends than if I isolate myself. So I\u2019ve mostly been isolating myself. What are some ways you guys have handled this/baby steps? I\u2019m worried my friends are going to think I\u2019m blowing them off. I want things to go back to normal, I\u2019m afraid people are going to perceive me as negative and antisocial when I\u2019m really just trying to protect myself from anxiety!",

I took it as I failed but kept moving on. In April I lost one of my dogs (I had 4 pugs) suddenly to an unknown brain tumor. Aslo in April I had to go on a heavy dose of antibiotics for lime disease after getting bitten by a tick on the first day of warm weather in spring (wear bug spray people) in October two days before his 14th birthday I lost my very first dog to kidney/liver failure. The day after Christmas I lost my 3rd dog to cancer. She was a senior dog as was all of them and couldnt have surgery due to other health conditions. All I had left was my dad's dog that I took in when he passed away a few years ago. He was diagnosed with Addison's disease and loosing the others took a toll on him. We lost him the day after New Years. The start of 2020 and I had lost everything, all my baby's that I had, had since I was 16. I am devastated. I hadn't even fully had time to properly mourn before all of this \"other\" stuff happened and now I am scared for my husband, my family and myself. I am pushing my self to stay busy the second I wake up to the moment I fall asleep, I cant take a second because my brain refuses to slow down, I feel like I'm constantly choking back tears.

            "selftext": "\\[In this post I will write the ideas that came to my mind that could be useful regarding my previous post.\\]\n\n**1. If you feel anxious about waiting for a video game, or if the wait becomes too stressful like it is for me:**\n\n*I was living perfectly well before I knew of the existence of \\[game\\], I was complete (I am complete), I don't need \\[game\\]. \\[game\\] is an addition to my life, not a need to be satiated. I'm good.*  \n*I have to get used to the idea that it is a long time before I can have \\[game\\] in my hands, so I should not focus my mind or time on waiting for that to happen, idealizing \\[game\\] or thinking about what I will do with it in the future. I must also understand and accept that I must be patient, and I must be aware that the work takes time. I don't have to occupy my mind with thoughts or ideas of \\[game\\].*  \n*I don't have to be aware of \\[game\\] if I don't want to/can't tolerate it. It is not necessary.*  \n*Developing a video game is a long, scary, but exciting journey. \\[game\\] is in the hands of professional people, who are aware of their actions and the repercussions of their actions, who know what they are doing and who are ideal for the work of making \\[game\\] the best it can be.*  \n*I have (or will have) things to deal with before I become interested in \\[game\\]/dedicate my attention to \\[game\\].*  \n*\\[game\\] is not (and should not be) a reason to live, nor is (and should be) any other video game.*  \n*The purpose of \\[game\\] is to entertain (it has no other purpose than to be enjoyed or to make you feel good). \\[game\\] is a (single) video game (nothing else).*  \n*I can't decide anything until \\[game\\] is released or is in my hands. I can't even do it after that.*  \n*I can live one day at a time. Can I ask myself, will I have \\[game\\] in my hands today? The answer is no, so I don't have to worry about \\[game\\] today. I'm anxious or excited, and it feels wrong, but I'm just going to focus on today, I'm just going to feel wrong/try not to feel wrong about today; I'm not living the future, I mean, I'm not going to trick my mind into saying that I'm going to feel the way I feel for weeks or months or years, because I'm feeling now, I'm experiencing the now. I can't live anything else but in the now, I can't feel anything else but what I'm feeling now, I can't adjust to anything else but what's happening now.*  \n*The future does not exist. Within an hour, within a day, within a week, within a month or within a year something unforeseen could happen that would make that \\[game\\] never come out, why worry about something that is not happening, why worry about something that might not happen?*  \n*It's going to be okay.*  \n*I'm not obliged to investigate the background of that video game.*  \n*I'd rather not hear about it. I voluntarily choose not to find out anything.*\n\n**2. If you feel you should be perfect, do everything perfectly, even knowing or playing games like me:**\n\n*\\[game\\] is not perfect.*  \n*\\[game\\] will never be perfect.*  \n*\\[game\\] doesn't have to be perfect. (I just have to enjoy it).*  \n*There are things I don't like about \\[game\\]. That's fine.*  \n*There will be things I won't like about \\[game\\]. That's fine.*  \n*\\[game\\] is like me: imperfect (forever).*  \n*Like with \\[game\\], there are things I don't like about myself. That's good.*  \n*I can enjoy \\[game\\], even if it's imperfect.*  \n*It's not my fault or my responsibility that \\[game\\] to be more or less perfect.*  \n*I can love \\[game\\] just the way it is.*  \n*I can enjoy \\[game\\] as it is.*  \n*I can feel good about \\[game\\] as it is.*  \n*I like \\[game\\]. I love \\[game\\]. The only thing I can do, the only thing my heart should do is love. And if I feel bad, I can try to stop thinking about everything, and just breathe or feel.*\n\n**3. If you have trouble connecting with reality, or feel that things are not real when you play, like I do:**\n\n*\\[game\\] is reality and ideas translated into its own language, which doesn't have to be my language. I also don't have to understand (or change) that language, that's not my goal or purpose.*  \n*\\[game\\] is not fake, it doesn't use a disguise, it's a skeleton, a body that dresses up to make dreams come true. It is a tool, it is a utility, and as such, it is not a trick or a gimmick, but something that is made to help.*  \n*I can see it as the architecture of a house or building: A house/building has a design or plans, it has a skeleton or base stones or foundations and it uses scaffolding and supports and that does not make the final result less valuable, good, real or true (than its bases). And, the bases of the building and the building are not isolated elements, separated or having nothing to do with each other. The bases of the building and the building are two equal parts of the same whole.*  \n*In spite of everything, I am not obliged to know what the plans or sketches of my house looked like or are like, nor to know how it was built so that I can live in it or feel welcomed by its walls or roof.*  \n*I don't have to be aware of or know the skeleton of \\[game\\]. I can immerse myself in it, (only) inside it, without doing anything else.*  \n*Likewise, I am not/do not feel obliged, nor is it my responsibility, nor is it necessary for me to follow up on a video game, nor know what or how its code or programming language is, nor its scripting, nor its 3D/2D or textured modelling, if that doesn't make me feel good or if I don't feel comfortable with it. I can perfectly wait and enjoy the final product (which should not be perfect, which will not be perfect, which may be imperfect) without any problem. I can play and enjoy and nothing more than that (just that).*  \n*All videogames have a background story, they have behind-the-scenes work, progress, developments, evolutions, regressions, errors. No game is more game or more perfect than another. Games don't come out of nowhere as an unattached, parallel and ideal reality from ours. There is no such thing as the perfect world of perfect ideas.*  \n*Even movies or TV series have architecture: writers, directors, actors, composers, editors and not because of that they are less real or true, nor less movies, nor do they stop being art, fun or charming.*  \n*Writers don't write a book at the first attempt. Painters do not finish their work on the first day. Musicians don't have a piece just by playing their instruments.*  \n*Every house/building has its architecture.*  \n*I have nothing to do with the development of \\[game\\].*\n\n**4. And don't forget that:**\n\n*You don't have to be the best player.*  \n*You don't have to be the most recognized player.*  \n*It's not your obligation to contribute to the game or the community if you are not capable of it.*  \n*It is not your obligation to edit the game wiki if you are not capable of it.*\n\n\\[I appreciate it if you read my post!

            "selftext": "\\[I've thought of some ideas to combat these problems, but I'll publish those ideas in another post so as not to embroil everything. (That doesn't mean I don't need help or advice).\\]\n\n**1. \"I can't wait!\"**\n\nIn December 2018 I came across a game that resembles my current favourite game. Since then, I've been thinking about it. I waited all through 2019 for the game to come out, only for the announcement to be made that the game would be released in 2021.\n\nLet me explain: This is a problem for 3 reasons: 1, I have too much free time to think; unfortunately I didn't get into college and I haven't gotten a job either; I'm a daydreamer easily. 2, I have depression; my reality is terrible, I don't like being in it, that leads me to wander in mental spaces. 3, I have OCD symptoms and suffer from anxiety, which means I have trouble relaxing, concentrating, using instant rewards, and doing repetitive tasks.\n\nI don't know how to stop thinking about that game constantly, and I'm stuck, because I can't possibly get ''satisfaction'' or ''gratification'' from other places.\n\nI don't know why, but my only current life purpose is to kill myself. It's the only real thing I'm supposed to have. Oddly enough, I also feel as if the only reason not to take my life is to not have played that game that I'm so excited about. I don't feel anything anymore, I don't care about anything, but that game is very special to me and I'm curious and hungry for it.\n\n**2. \"It has to be perfect!\"**\n\nIt's hard for me not to think about the aspects of each object or thing, video games are no exception. When I play, or when I follow the development of a game, I get a lot of stress, because I notice the mistakes or the \"things that could be better\". Most of the time I can't enjoy anything because of this desire for perfection, for accuracy, for control, for precision... I don't know how to relax and stop thinking.\n\n**3. \"It's not real!\"**\n\nRegarding the previous point, not only does the game not feel \"perfect\" but \"fake\". Going into how a game is made ruins my whole experience, it feels like an impostor or a malicious trick. I don't know why. Many times I've suffered from unrealization or disconnection from reality in my life... I don't know how to stop.\n\n\\[I appreciate it if you read my post! I wish you a great day!\\] \ud83e\udd17",
