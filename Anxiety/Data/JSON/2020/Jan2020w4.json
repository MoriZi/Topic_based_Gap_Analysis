There was this guy that I really liked for a long time and he asked me once if we could fuck when I was giving him head and I said no. I kind of wanted to but I get too scared and can't go through with it. I mean I want to have sex but I'm scared it will hurt or I'll get pregnant and they'll leave me. I know if you're wet enough it will hurt less but I can't even get wet and I won't let a guy go down to do it for me. One time this guy kept trying to take my jeans off and I held onto them so he couldn't get them off. He did finger me through the zipper part for a few seconds but it hurt and tickled so bad I told him to stop. \n\n\nI'm pretty fat and I don't want a guy to see me naked. A couple guys begged to see my boobs and I wouldn't let them see because I don't want them to see my disgusting body. I mean if I got naked in front of a guy he would probably scream and run away or puke. I have a skin problem where I have these red sore things on my stomach and chest. \n\n\nI have given head a bunch of times and been fingered from the back but that's it. What should I do?",

            "selftext": "I find when im stuck at home all day, thats when my anxiety and depression act up. I try and do things to pass the time and occupy my mind, but it seems like everything I do just doesn't bring any enjoyment to me, or worse, they, for some reason, become triggers. For example, im sick now, and ive been stuck at home since saturday. I've been trying to watch tv or movies, but everything I try watching, it's like it triggers my anxiety. It's almost like everything on tv, every movie, holds a triggering memory, which im not even sure exists. There isn't really anything else to do, because my depression makes everything boring and unenjoyable. So I just stay in bed, try and find *something* which will bring enjoyment, but nothing does. So then I feel stuck, with nothing to do. Which brings about even more anxiety (the feeling of being stuck or trapped makes my anxiety skyrocket). It's like depression has robbed me of enjoyment of things, and the inactivity makes me anxious. Of course, when im not sick etc, I go to the gym, or just try and go out, but when im sick, or stuck at home, theres nothing I can really do.\n\nI feel so hopeless. I've already sought help, but I feel like im not getting enough support. I also struggle with brain fog and stuff, and find it really difficult to explain what im feeling, even to myself. Im seeing a therapist, and am medicated (Cipralex and Wellbutrin). But every therapy session, I feel like I have way too much to get out of my head, that by the time im done talking, my time is up. I really feel like I can't be alone in this. I'd be open to support groups, but the ones ive found are either too costly, or im just nervous that all the talk of anxiety and stuff might trigger me. My body and mind feel so tense, and nothing i've tried doing can release it. I can't cry, even though I really want to. This anxiety has taken over my life. I'm 31, and had to move back in with my parents because living on my own was too much for my mental health. I'm working a shitty retail job because I don't enjoy anything, and anything i've thought about doing is too risky (i've always wanted to be a pilot, but I know i'll have an anxiety attack while in the air). Everything has been ground down to a halt.",

            "selftext": "So I am a female who is 22 and my boyfriend is 20.\nWe have been dating a month.\n\nSo, I just started dating him . I talked to him a whileeeee before we started dating though and I love him to death. However, my anxiety is really bad and all I do is sit in my head and think about things like, does he really love me? Or if he doesn\u2019t respond for a few hours I wonder if he\u2019s tired of me? I wonder if he thinks I\u2019m annoying because of my anxiety too. I have tried to talk to him about it and I know most normal people worry about things like this, but these thoughts just consume me sometimes. \n\nHe reassures me every time and tells me he loves me, but it\u2019s like I don\u2019t know. And he\u2019s reassured me multiple times but at this point I don\u2019t talk to him about it anymore because I\u2019m afraid he\u2019ll get tired of reassuring me for the same things over and over and that he won\u2019t love me anymore \ud83d\ude25. So not talking to him about it also increases the anxiety I have. I believe he loves me, I really do. I\u2019m just, I don\u2019t know...worried he just suddenly won\u2019t? Or that one day he\u2019ll just stop? \n\nI literally love him so much. He\u2019s my person. I\u2019m pretty sure it\u2019s the guy I\u2019m supposed to be with for the rest of my life. But I don\u2019t want my anxiety to ruin it, or to ruin my experience with him. I want to be present in the relationship and not worrying but I can\u2019t make it stop and I want nothing more than to stay with him for a very long time. I don\u2019t really know what to do at this point. I don\u2019t want to come off clingy or needy but it\u2019s like everything I do reminds me of him. I hear a funny joke and I\u2019m like , oh! I have to tell him. Or I\u2019m simply washing dishes and I remember a memory of us washing dishes together. It\u2019s like even the little things. Everything. And on top of that, he has a new job working on a boat where he works for a month and then comes home for two weeks and then goes back for another month etc. and he starts Monday. I\u2019m extremely stressed about that situation as well I\u2019m afraid he\u2019ll realize he doesn\u2019t want me or he\u2019ll enjoy being away from me.  But he assured me that he wants nothing more than to spend time with me and that he isn\u2019t going anywhere. But I still and so worried. I know this was kind of everywhere but PLEASE tell me what to do. I can not lose him. He really is my person.\n\nWhat do I do? I\u2019m seriously at a loss as to how to go about handling this. I don\u2019t want to be too needy and clingy by talking about my worries and how they consume me, but I feel like it\u2019s something I should talk about, but it happens so often I don\u2019t want to bring it up all of the time. It\u2019s so lonely though not being able to talk about it every time. Then I\u2019m just stuck in my head alone, and that\u2019s almost worse. \n\nTL: my anxiety is consuming me with thoughts I can\u2019t stop about my relationship. I\u2019m finally happy for once and I don\u2019t want to lose this guy. He is my person. I don\u2019t know what to do",

It takes a while for me to warm up to a situation before I come out and talk about any topic that comes to mind . \n\nRecently I was with some people I'm not too familiar with but I know them through a friend of mine . A part of me felt kind of closed off and not included into their conversations . They spoke to me a bit but never really brought me into what they were saying and when I did talk , it was as if they didn't get my jokes etc and I felt really isolated , my confidence in the situation went down .\n\nNow , these guys are what I would call \"bad boy\" type of guys . The guys who get all of the girls because they say whatever they want. This made me feel as if I was inferior to them and that they were the \"alphas\" leading the social interaction . My anxiety got worse when I realised this which ultimately led me to back off and leave altogether. They just weren't my click but I'm beginning to think about what my click actually is . \n\nI'm not sure if the problem is me not being open enough and showing more confidence or if it's otherwise. \n\nThanks",

If I\u2019m not hanging out with my boyfriend, chances are I\u2019m alone. I do have social anxiety so I struggle to make the first move in conversations (though I am trying to get better!!) and I just find that connections I do make don\u2019t turn into anything that lasts or anything beyond a classroom friendship. I\u2019m afraid that I\u2019ve missed my time and that all my lasting friendships would have come from freshman year. Does anyone have any advice?",

            "selftext": "I wanted a dog partially to help with my anxiety/depression. It wasn\u2019t the only reason I wanted a dog. I\u2019ve wanted a dog forever but had to wait until I was on my own to get one.\n\nI got my boy but I feel more stressed and sad than I was before. He has some issues (no former house training, nuisance barking from separation anxiety, ect). I knew I\u2019d need to work with any dog I got. But I think I\u2019m overwhelmed. I wish I could have a trainer to contact via text. Like a dog guru or something. My family doesn\u2019t own animals (I\u2019m the first in my family to own a dog) so they have no advice to give. I asked a friend who owned a dog and she gave me bad advice, telling me to hit my dog. Which turned into a whole big argument and sort of tore up our friendship a bit.\n\nI have no friends in the city I moved too. So no one in my area to call on for support. The next available training session I can attend is in two months. I cried from the stress of it all the other day as I feel I can\u2019t get anything done in my apartment I need to because I\u2019m constantly watching my dog as he tries to sneak off the pee in the house. It\u2019s just been a lot to deal with and I\u2019m not sure what to do.",

I\u2019ve only had this happen to me one other time where I was panicking for so long and was so tense that I started to get dizzy and felt like I could pass out. Well today I had to drive an hour away to a work event early in the morning on a highway I\u2019m not familiar with and I ended up panicking the entire time. It got so bad that I felt close to passing out so I hopped off the next exit and sat at a gas station where I cried, called my mom, and tried to calm down. I eventually was able to get back on, with her staying on the phone with me, and make it to the event on time. But it was awful. I hate this feeling and the fact that I\u2019m 24 years old and still call my mom crying about driving is embarrassing.",

            "selftext": "Where to start? \n\nLooking back, I\u2019ve had issues with depression and anxiety all my life. Neither became serious or intense enough for me to seek help until about ten years ago (I\u2019m in my early 40s). \n\nOf course, since being diagnosed, I\u2019ve been through the gauntlet of meds and combinations there of. I imagine it\u2019s the same for many people but, for me, they seem to help maybe 10 or 20 percent of the time but that\u2019s about it. \n\nI\u2019ve been married for a long time and, while we\u2019ve had ups and downs, things have generally been pretty good up until this past year. The digs and jabs at each other just started to get progressively worse along with a steady increase to just fighting in general and....you get the idea. Our fights have never involved violence of any kind until a few weeks ago. It was a bad one and we were both yelling a lot. My wife gets very malicious and cruel when she\u2019s angry. She knows just where the separations are in my \u201carmor\u201d and has no issue with exploiting those\nvulnerabilities. She began doing so during this fight a few weeks back and really hit a nerve that caused me to start to cry. I was reduced to the point of sobbing and I asked her for us to just call a halt to the hostilities and talk. I reached out to attempt hugging her and she hit me. Hard. She didn\u2019t hurt me and it hasn\u2019t happened since but she was clearly putting everything she had behind that swat and I never, in a million years, expected it. She never apologized but she hasn\u2019t done it since. \n\nI\u2019ve been here for a few years and met someone I thought was a kindred spirit in a sub a couple of weeks ago. I should have known better, but we became very close very fast and it felt great to have someone just to talk to that actually made me smile and feel good about myself. After about a week and a half, that all came to a screeching halt. Ghosted. Ghosted, but this is Reddit, so I got to still watch her flirt with and hit on other me.  Lesson learned. It was something that I shouldn\u2019t have been doing in the first place so I brought 100% of that hurt upon myself. Fuck, though, did it (and does it) hurt. \n\nWhile there\u2019s been no more boxing, the fighting just continues to intensify at home. Something that is new, though, is that she\u2019s started using my mental health struggles as ammo against me and holding them over my head during our arguments. \n\nThis week, after 20 years of busting my ass for the same company and working my way into a great, extremely well-paying job that I earned and loved, I was downsized. More fuel for the argument fires. \n\nI can\u2019t. I just can\u2019t. I want to sleep. I want to hide. I want to run away. I want to do whatever I need to do for this feeling to stop. After forty odd years of life, it\u2019s just shown me very quickly and in painful detail, how fucking disposable I am. Ok, universe. Point taken. Now what?\n\nIf I pull the rip cord on life, it will destroy my family and the thought of doing that to them makes me sick(er) inside. On the flip side, I can\u2019t face the thought of waking up tomorrow (and the day after that, the day after that, etc.) next to someone who is clearly done with me and will likely remind me of how useless I am before lunch time. \n\nFor those of you that read through all of my drivel, thank you so much. I have no idea what I\u2019m going to do but I know I don\u2019t want to do it. I just needed to get this off of my chest. \n\nLove to all of you that are out there and struggling. I know that it could be so much worse for me and I wish that I could do something to help each and every one of you that are hurting. \u2764\ufe0f\ud83d\udc94\ud83d\ude1e",

Starting about two months ago it has gotten to a point where it's starting to impact my life. I now walk to work every day. Doesnt matter if it's cold or raining really hard, I walk there and back every day. Luckily it's only about two miles. \n\nThe biggest problem, though, is when I have to drive my wife to work on my two days off each week. She works 30 minutes away and I have to drive through the city (the most anxious part of the drive). I get super paranoid and have thoughts like, \n\n\"what if I don't see a pedestrian?\" \n\"what if I accidentally run a red light?\" \n\"Did I just run that stop sign?\" \nEtc.\n\nI don't know where this anxiety comes from, I used to be a very confident driver. I've never gotten in an accident while driving, I'm never in a hurry or speeding, I've never even gotten so much as a parking ticket. I'm just so scared to drive all the time, and I have to go pick my wife up in an hour and I'm dreading it.\n\nThanks to anyone who reads this. None of my friends really understand when I tell them, and I just wanted to share my feelings with some people who have probably gone through this. Any advice is welcome.",

            "selftext": "Hi reddit. I am a 23F and I\u2019ve dealt with severe anxiety for as long as I can remember. Last year I began seeing a therapist weekly and stopped prozac. It really seemed to be helping me but a few months ago I began having strange episodes again (I used to see multiple doctors for these episodes when I was in high school and nobody could figure out what was going on).  These episodes seem to happen in crowded places with a lot going on, such as restaurants. I begin feeling strange and dizzy, next I will get physically sick and throw up or have diarrhea. I then begin to over heat and get extremely stressed out to the point where I want to scream.  During these episodes none of my calming exercises such as deep breathing seem to help me calm down. I can only focus on the overwhelming noise, smells, and bright lights. The only thing that helps is removing myself from the situation. My therapist diagnosed these episodes as panic attacks and told me I should start medicine again. I\u2019m not interested in taking meds anymore and I don\u2019t know how else to manage this. Has anybody experienced something similar and do you have any advice?  Please help me because I am suffering.\n\nTLDR: I get physically sick in situations I find overwhelming. This started a few months ago and my therapist diagnosed these episodes as panic attacks. They are becoming increasingly frequent and I don\u2019t know how to manage them anymore. Please offer advice or share stories if you\u2019ve experienced something similar.\n\nThanks.\nEdit: My therapist believes I have ADHD but she\u2019s still unsure.  I\u2019m not sure I agree with her but I\u2019ll trust her judgement.",

So I wore some nice pink shades and went out, only for my sister to be appalled by the colours on my eyelids  (mind you it really wasn't much), but because I'm Asian and our makeup style tends to be more 'Korean' and 'Natural', having something other than brown and solely ON your eyelid (not touching your brows), is considered too much. This was the start of me feeling anxious, but I brushed it off wondering what my friend would say more. Thankfully he loved what I did with my makeup, and we were talking about it when I said my sister had nice eyelids and I wanted to try doing her makeup and using her as a canvas. She declined and said she doesn't trust me, and that she didn't want to look like 'that' (insinuating I looked horrible) in front of a lot of people. \n\nHer new boyfriend, however, said that he preferred her to be natural, etc when he wasn't even 'in' the conversation. I playfully retorted \"no one asked for your opinion\" and then giggled. A part of me meant it, but a part of me also meant it playfully. However, I forgot that he was new to me and didn't know when I was playing or when I was being serious. My sister snapped at me pretty loudly and called me rude. Which was weird for me because she has said worse to me but we usually have a healthy laugh and it's just how we banter playfully with each other. I was taken aback. I clarified, and she was better, but I felt bad. After a lot of drinks, I drunkenly apologized to him when I got back, only for my sister to make fun of me being drunk. I wasn't \\*that\\* drunk but I was definitely tipsy. She always makes fun of me being drunk, but when she gets drunk, I always have to look after her, even though she denies being drunk. Whereas if I'm drunk, I admit it and then laugh it off and sleep. So my anxiety was already beginning.\n\nThe next day she had plans to celebrate new years. I was really exhausted mentally, physically and socially from the night before, but she told me it was new years and that I'd be lame and boring if I didn't go out and celebrate it like 'cool people do'. Being peer pressured, I agreed and called the same friend out. He's amazing and he helps my anxiety come down. So we went out and the night started out fine as I was at a different bar than my sister (though in the same area). After getting asked by my sister to join her several times, I caved in and joined her. And this is when it all went downhill.\n\nI was sober when I got there and joined her. After a few drinks we were playing around with the glow sticks and she would tease me and call me names, when I was just having fun with my friend. \n\nA little side/back story: the bar I was previously in was more of my watering hole, and the bar she was at was more her watering hole. My watering hole was somewhere I could drink till whenever I liked, and the staff would just let us finish our drinks as they closed up. This was something my sister also did in her own watering hole. \n\nBack to the story: One of the waiters at my sister's watering hole got drunk. And as I was heading to the bathroom, he grabbed me by the arm, wished me a happy new years and told me off that I shouldn't show up so late as he wanted to go home early. I apologised and said I probably won't. After some drinks, they were closing up, and they had other customers there too. I was itching for one more mug and then I'd leave. I asked the table (5 of us) if we still wanted a drink. We could get 4 mugs (1 set) and go home. Every one agreed, including my sister. But she said she'd give me 10 minutes to chug it and then we'd go. I agreed. I asked the manager nicely if I could get another set, but if they can't it's alright. I even offered the manager a mug and he happily said yes. The beers came and we were finishing up when the drunk waiter, who at this point was reaaaally drunk went off at me completely in front of everyone. He tried to shove me off my seat, yelled at me for getting another, told me to take my drinks out and drink it on the street and was just overall making me feel horrible about it. I just nodded, and chugged and ran out with everyone else. I was close to tears at this point, but I held it in. \n\nI was just appalled. I felt horrible. I felt bad. As I walked out my sister kept telling me it's my fault, I should've known better, I was being 'too much', etc. I was telling her how I asked and the manager happily said yes. If he had said no, I would've walked out. My other watering hole would be nice about it, and my sister's watering hole would be nice to her about it too. When she went to mine, they'd be nice to her, and when I went to hers, they'd be nice to me too. So it was nothing out of the ordinary for us. My sister would always brag that she was there till 6am all the time, so I thought since it's New Years, it would be the same case.\n\nMy friend didn't know what was going on as he couldn't understand the drunk waiter. He was slurring most of the time, and my friend couldn't catch what was happening. When I told my friend (days later), he was shocked and appalled that it was all happening to me. On the way back, my sister was just saying it was my fault etc. I came home crying. Called my friend and unloaded on him about everything my sister does to me and my mental state. \n\nTo summarise: All my life she's called me fat. She told me I couldn't wear cropped tops because I had a muffin top, said I shouldn't wear shorts or skirts because I had scars on my legs. We have different styles, and she'd call my style boring or normal. When I dress up a little, she'll say i'm emo/goth because I want attention, or if i wear something low cut or short, she calls me a slut. She says it playfully these days, but in the past it really did hurt. I just recently cut my bangs and she was horrified. Whatever I do, in terms of my looks, if I wasn't spending a bomb on it, I was ugly in some sort of way. I can't even play around with my eye shadow palette without her commenting that it's 'not enough' or 'too much'. She used to insult me for wearing eyeliner all the time (i did it for practice), but now requests my assistance in drawing her eyeliner for her because she can't do it in a short time (she takes hours). I'd get into what she says to me that's not related to my looks but that's a WHOLE other thing that I don't want to get into. \n\nAnd until today, I just... I'm not over it. I go to work, and I'm so tired I can't focus. I want to stay home all the time, but when I do it too much, I just feel overwhelmed by anxiety and my thoughts circling around me that I quickly text a close friend and head out. I wrote a whole medium post on [Asian makeup hypocrisy](https://link.medium.com/YLxV5ul8A3). And until today I still feel affected by it all. And I told myself this 2020, I was not going to take shit from her anymore, but I still sometimes do. She's my sister, we live together, sometimes she's nice to me... \n\nWhen my bestfriend told me that my sister should've defended me when the waiter was yelling at me, or at least knew better than to make me feel worse about it, was when I realised how toxic she was to me. I mean I knew she was always mean sometimes, but it was only now that I realised that even though I've grown from all her mean words and I 'don't care', a part of me does and though I shrug it off the moment it happens, I still think about it after. I just tell myself that it's okay, and that's just her and it goes away for as long as it does. It'll come back once in a while, but generally it doesn't come back and bite me \\*this\\* hard.\n\nBut that night made me feel horrible, and sometimes it plays over and over again in my head. She even made me go back there again when I swore to myself never to go back there (she hosted a family event there and I had to go) and I had to swallow all my anxiety for the night. And maybe that's why it's eating me up again and now I got to rant here. I can't even tell her I never want to go back there because I know she'd tell me that I was the one overreacting and that it's my fault anyway. She'd call me weak and stuff. If I could erase that entire moment from my head, I would. This post is in between \"i need a hug\" and \"venting\" really, but I'm going to put it as 'venting' because this is a long rant and I do apologise for it.",

I will try to keep this as short as possible...\n\nIm currently 26 years old, and have struggled with depression for roughly 10 years. My depression have come and gone as the years have gone by, but at my roughest point I planned to take my own life. Luckly my family and friends notice that something was wrong and \"helped\" me out of it.\n\nI have been very down lately and I have started to do something VERY strange, so strange that I have no clue whats going on here and Im kind of scared. I often don't sleep in my bed anymore, instead i sleep on the floor or in the bathroom (!)(?) - And I don't know why. I brush my teeths and I don't feel comfortable to go and sleep in my bed. Instead the floor next to the bed or the floor in the bathroom feel much for suitable or something. I have been doing this for a week know, and Im starting to think what the hell is going on with me?\n\n(English is not my first language - sorry)",
