            "selftext": "I\u2019ve been dealing with depression and anxiety basically my entire life, I just turned 40 last week. I\u2019ve seen therapists, been on meds, and have found little relief. Therapists have never been a help, and I\u2019ve been to half a dozen different therapists over the years. Meds helped, but I hated the side effects. The loss of libido is the big one I didn\u2019t like, but I also was incapable of crying for years while on meds, even when my father died. I gave up meds because I don\u2019t want to go through life being a zombie.\n\nMy stress and anxiety is always provoked by my job. I started a work from home job about a year and a half ago, and since then the anxiety from work has been manifesting as physical illness. I\u2019m not underperforming, everyone at work praises me for how good I am at what I do. But we\u2019ve lost valuable members of my team over the last few months, and all of their work has landed on my plate. That in and of itself causes anxiety.\n\nI started speaking up to management at work about the unreasonable workload and the fact that they haven\u2019t bothered to replace the 2 employees who quit / got fired. We are given a quarterly bonus, and last week I was informed that my bonus is being docked 25% because I\u2019ve been complaining about the workload. That fucking pisses me off, especially when my employment agreement outlines that one of the criteria for the bonus is that we push back when the workload is too much. But it doesn\u2019t seem to matter, they\u2019re still docking my bonus.\n\nThis is basically the last straw and I\u2019m coming to the conclusion that I need to quit this job. This decision is causing an immense amount of anxiety for me. On my actual 40th birthday last week is when this all manifested as illness. Total loss of appetite, complete exhaustion, body aches, I feel like I have a fever but the thermometer says no, I\u2019m nauseous, and I can do almost nothing but sleep most of the day.\n\nI\u2019m sure depression is at play here too, but I think it\u2019s the anxiety causing the illness. I am CONSTANTLY thinking about this job and how to get out. I wake up thinking about it, and the thoughts persist 24/7. Last night I tried some mindfulness and focused on my breathing when I\u2019d wake up in the middle of the night with anxiety. That helped get me back to sleep, for about 20 minutes, and I must\u2019ve repeated that a dozen times throughout the night.\n\nI\u2019m thinking that I need to get out of this job immediately, even before I\u2019ve lined up another job, which I\u2019ve never done before. That\u2019s causing anxiety and panic. Financially I\u2019ll be fine, I\u2019ve saved $30k in the past year and I can survive a while without a job if I have to. But that financial security does nothing to relieve my anxiety.\n\nSo I guess my question is - what do you guys do to prevent your anxiety from reaching the point of physical illness? And what do you do to recover after you\u2019ve reached physical illness?",

This is not self promotion, I\u2019m just trying to help out some people that feel the way I felt, because I felt like I had nobody. \n\nFeel free to message me if you need advice.

I'm feeling like my life lost its magic and specially the ones I love. I'm really really struggling with this, having a lot of repetitive anxious thoughts and sadness that keeps repeating over and over again everyday and then I search more about it and more... I was never religious, rather agnostic, but now knowing that most likely everything can be explain by the brain and all is determined is being so hard to deal with. Then I get into thinking that if we're all made of out the universe, all the suffer there is, all the pain, why does existence occurs? If time is relative, all the pain is eternal? Every conscious being that has suffer and will suffer, the notions of a Big Bang repeating over and over again...  I'm feeling so lonely with all of this.. I've seriously never felt so shit in my whole life.",

I blame it on the quarantine as I haven't been able to see my therapist for many weeks now and the whole lockdown thing has had a very bad affect on my mental health. My PTSD and guilt has come back stronger than it used to be, and every night I can't help but dwell on the abuse I've endured and paranoia about my ducks dying (they're perfectly healthy and there's nothing dangerous where I live, but when I'm trying to get to sleep my mind forces me to think about \"what if this happened to them?\" ) to the point of tears welling up in my eyes. It's affecting my relationships because I've been dwelling on past things that happened in those relationships, making me question them. I want to forget about the past and stop with the \"what if\"s, but I can't. I'm a massive \"what if\"-er, I get sad over things that haven't happened (for example, what if I stepped on a duckling in an alternative universe?). I know it's pointless because there's nothing I can do about it but I can't make it go away. Even if I watch funny videos of Scottish people in predicaments before going to sleep I still get these episodes. So, how do I ignore these anxieties and focus on more fun things?",

I felt like I could project myself onto these characters and take on a new identity.\nRecently though, with the stress of everything happening in the world, it feels like there's a barrier in my mind. \n\nMy anxiety causes me to re-read each sentence obsessively even though i know i have read and understood it. Before i flip the page I have to make sure i know every single detail of what happened.  Sometimes it takes me hours just to complete a short chapter. It's frustrating! I just want to be able to visualise everything in my head again without troubles. \n\nIt might seem really trivial but reading has always been a  huge part of my childhood. Now i have all these books around me but I don't know if I can start one again. I can't describe it. I really, really want to do it, but I just can't seem to. \n\n I used it as a coping mechanism, but now even reading is not enjoyable anymore.",

It could be someone I\u2019ve known for years and upon meeting them I\u2019ll get so nervous, jittery, not know what to say, and I\u2019ll start over analyzing my every word and move. This has caused me to avoid hanging out with friends or hanging out with them one on one. This makes me feel terrible because I do appreciate my friends but out of anxiousness I tend to decline plans a lot more than I accept them. I\u2019m sure this has caused me to look fake but I swear it\u2019s not my intention. Anyone else have any similar experiences?",

I should have my own solid opinion, right? And as I\u2019m writing this, I realize that this sort of thing is happening in other parts of my life. I love performing (acting, singing, etc) but there is that same voice in my head that\u2019s giving me doubt even though deep down it\u2019s my life long dream to pursue it as a career.  It\u2019s doing the same thing with my crush!\n\nSorry to go all over the place. I\u2019m frustrated with not knowing what my own thoughts are, ever.

I was breathing fast and my hands were shaking. \nI also thought I saw my ex at a drive thru and had a panic attack.\nI also almost had to have an interaction with a neighbor and thought I was going to have a panic attack.\n\nThis is abnormal for me.

Recently I got reconnected with my Best friend and she really helped me get myself together after I hit a fairly low point. I had really shitty job I thought I made friends with coworkers they weren't. I was a full blown shut in the whole time I had that job. After reconnecting with my friend I got a better job and got out my head more. To the point where I'm talking to my actual  friends more. The only thing keeping my anxiety in check is her and I'm scared it'll become a burden to her. It happened in the past before and she completely stop talking to me for a 13 months. So I think medication might be the only solution. I have a bad history taking too much Xanax when I was in high school and pretty much anything that makes me feel better I tend to abuse them to the point I can't function. I'm afraid that if I start taking medication I'll over do it and mess up everything. I'm not really sure what I'm expecting someone to tell me here I just thought I'd post it to get it out my chest.",
