Live on FB, the rioters asked where they were and had to read verbatim a sign that hangs over the downtown area- these people are not from my small town. If you live here, you know every part of the city. They\u2019ve posted ads on Snapchat and other social media getting people to come out. I have no problem with protesting as long as the protest stays within legalities of the law. But when these people leave, where does that leave us who still live here? Where does it leave the us who have jobs- no- had jobs. We\u2019re in the middle of a pandemic. Money is scarce, people are scared, and now our stores are burning. Our doctors offices are burning. These riots and looting are hurting the people that are already struggling. What about the people that invested every dime they had saved on their business to have it burnt down to a smoldering pile of black ash... So, what happens tomorrow?",

            "selftext": "I've had anxiety issues for a long time, some periods much worse than others. But I spent a lot of years in denial about how bad it really was. I thought that because I could function reasonably well, then it must not be much of an issue. Early last month, I was definitely feeling nervous and overly anxious due to the pandemic and a lot of issues in my life surrounding that. I didn't realize how much everything was impacting me until it all just came over me, a flood of panic. It started by just laying down with heart palpitations, being unable to sleep. Then I spiraled into panic mode and couldn't seem to calm myself. I didn't sleep for two nights. \n\nSince then, I've reached out for some help. But the past almost two months have been the most difficult my anxiety has ever been. The physical symptoms have really kept me in a spiral loop of constant fear. The palpitations have never gone away. It's a constant noticing of my heartbeat all day every day,  unless I'm completely distracted or walking, doing something that can help me forget. I had blood work, heart test, all normal. My doctors fully believe it's a symptom of my anxiety and I do too. But it doesn't make it any easier. It's so hard to feel like you can recover from intense anxiety when the physical symptoms are so difficult to accept. Can anyone related?",

            "selftext": "Hi guys,\n\nI\u2019ve been struggling with mental health for almost four years now. I have been suffering from stress, depression, social anxiety and I don\u2019t think a lot of people know that besides my best friend. I haven\u2019t told my parents either. Last night some guests came over and left after some hours. Today when I woke up my mom started berating me and started getting mad at me because I wasn\u2019t talking properly to them, wasn\u2019t showing respect, wasn\u2019t even starting a conversation, so basically I didn\u2019t give a fuck that they were here. I have been alone for so long now that I go into a state where I start thinking excessively and have negative intrusive thoughts whenever I\u2019m among a group of people or people who I don\u2019t want to be around. This was one case. Although I don\u2019t hate them I just don\u2019t give a fuck about them. And being a south Asian brown male (Pakistani), brown parents treat this as highly disrespectful and my mom kept saying that I need to socialize more and even go to their house (why tf would I go to their house when idgaf). I\u2019m sorry guys, I\u2019m just depressed and cried again after a very long time. I thought I was recovering but I still haven\u2019t. My parents fail to acknowledge my mental health issues. I\u2019m seeing my counselor again. Thanks for listening to my story. Again, I\u2019m sorry....",

            "selftext": "Hello everyone!  As I mentioned in the title, I am 40 years old and I have suffered from anxiety all my life.  But I had no idea.\n\nIn short, since I was a child I have always felt an obsession with death, an irrational fear of dogs, of being robbed, anguish, sadness, lack of interest in others and socializing and an excessive concern with everything.\n\nWhen I reached adulthood, I unconsciously realized that if I consumed alcohol, life would go better.  And, unfortunately, I chosed  this path.  Unsurprisingly, it didn't go well.\n\nAs I drank only at night, alone, at home, I increasingly isolated myself from the world.  I have reached this stage when I have no friends.  The only interaction I have with people is at work.\n\nAlso for professional reasons, today I visited a website of a clinic that also has psychotherapy and started to read.  I freaked out.  That was the description of what I have always felt.\n\nConclusion - I learned that all symptoms are not who I am, that is, they are not marks of my personality.  After all, I need help.  And that help exists.\n\nTomorrow I will make an appointment and start this journey towards a more serene, balanced and happy life.  I am anxious, but determined.\n\nHowever, I also discovered this sub.  I am reading your posts, and I must tell you right now that you are heroes!  thank you for sharing your life, your struggles, the small defeats but, above all, your big victories!",

I live about an hour away from Chicago and cities around me have already imposed a curfew due to violence, looting--NOT peaceful protesting.\n\nMy mom is a nurse who works across from a Target that was looted. I am terrified for her safety and the safety of my family and my town. The world right now is scaring me.\n\nI really can't make myself rationalize anything right now--it's like my brain is short-circuiting. I guess I just need to hear how other people feel and hear other people's perspectives so I can feel like I'm not so lonely.\n\nPeace.",

I know both sides thoughts and see them being pulled to further and further extremes ( due to growing up and training in vastly different types of communities I have constant input on social media from both sides).\nI feel everything is getting pulled apart and a fire has been set to already high tensions.. and a have this constant ball in the pit of my stomache I want to help I want to bridge them cuz they aren\u2019t that different. But I know nothing I do will help. No one wants to listen to a middle view. I couldn\u2019t even have a say as a health care worker about the virus, how am I supposed to say do anything on racial and police violence matters. I don\u2019t know what the truth is and I truely don\u2019t think anyone does.

Promise I\u2019ve read both sides and understand the concern of both... and don\u2019t know the right answer...

I was thinking the other day \"I am 26 years old, and its time to settle down which is something I do want, but what if my my anxiety about my relationship is actually a gut feeling or intuition that it won't work out?\". My boyfriend is incredible and our relationship is strong, although like all couples we have our ups and downs. We have been together for 2 years and live together. But through all of that my anxiety has been going crazy. And I wonder if it's actually my gut telling me that something is wrong with it. And I will be in this relationship for a long time, and then it will eventually not work out, just because I ignored my gut feeling.

            "selftext": "Hey everyone! I\u2019ve been working through some issues with anxiety for a long time now and I\u2019ve noticed that whenever I feel very anxious, I get this tingling/tightness but not quite either of those things in my chest. Sort of like stomach butterflies, but more like heart butterflies? Also like someone is gently squeezing my heart, enough that it doesn\u2019t hurt but feels incredibly uncomfortable. It doesn\u2019t feel like a rapid heartbeat, although I\u2019m sure my heart is beating much faster than normal. Does anyone else experience this and kinda understand the feeling I\u2019m trying to describe? I\u2019m curious if other people\u2019s anxiety manifests in the same physical way and if anything helps you calm it down. \n\nI\u2019d also just like to hear how anxiety affects you physically in general, if you wouldn\u2019t mind sharing!",

I understand the feeling.\n\n I hope you will not give up. I hope you will not hide. But I understand why you would. I hope you will overcome the shame spirals. I know you can use your voices, your time, your money, to do other things for the BLM movement offline. You don't have to be good at all the things. I would be proud of you if you just do one thing to help. \n\nThere is not much written on anxiety as a barrier to activism. It's not your fault if you're afraid of saying the wrong thing, or if you are already so debilitated by your mental health symptoms that it seems too much to add anything more to your plate. I say this because I have been there. I say this because seeing posts shaming others about saying nothing or doing the bare minimum or doing it wrong have only ever sent me into shut down mode. \n\nThere is no compassion for others who are held back by anxiety in this shameful messaging. No compassion for people with attachment injuries. No acknowledgment of panic attacks and emotional flashbacks. I know MANY OF YOU CARE AND ARE JUST SHUT DOWN RIGHT NOW.\n\nIf you want to know more about what you are experiencing on top of your base anxiety that is giving you this stress please read the book \"White Fragility.\" I also recommend \"How to Be an Anti Racist\" and \"The New Jim Crow\" \n\nIf you can't call your representatives, email them or write them letters. \n\nIf you can't speak out right now: donate, read, buy yourself some comfort food from a black owned business near you. \n\nYou can donate to: the Black Visions Collective, the Minnesota freedom fund, and many other options",
