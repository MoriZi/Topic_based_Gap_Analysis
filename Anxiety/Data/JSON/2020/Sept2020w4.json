            "selftext": "***If you have a fear of death, this might be triggering as I give specific details about my thoughts.***\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo... where do I begin? I'm really not too sure when this started happening but I think the first time I really noticed it was somewhere around six months ago. And probably within the last month or two, I am CONSTANTLY thinking about it. Obsessing. I can't talk about it... if I even try to I go into a panic attack. Just thinking about it fills me with such a huge fear. I'm terrified. Even physically I can feel the terror... racing heart, shaking hands, sweating, emotionally terrified. I'm not religious or even really spiritual. I don't think anything happens when we die. It's just the end. Total eternal nothingness. No memories, no nothing. I don't even know how to process this. I'm always worrying about the day I lose a loved one. My mother, my dog, my partner. My dog is my best friend, it's just her and I in the house. She's around 10 now and her face is almost completely gray. There are times, quite often lately, where I look at her face and just start sobbing and then go into a panic. I can't imagine my life without her and don't think I could even survive it. Then I go into these extremely vivid day dreams of her dying. Different scenarios. That are so real I feel as though it's actually happening and start to panic. My mom is starting to get wrinkles in her hands and around her eyes and I've become extremely aware of them. It starts to make me feel panicky and I have to really avert my brain to stay calm. My partner and I have a 20 year age gap. I don't think I've ever loved someone so deeply and I truly think I've finally found \"the one\". I'm constantly thinking about how much time I have with him. I imagined myself growing old with my partner but he will obviously get to old age much sooner than I. It's not fair finding your mate and being cheated on so much time.\n\nThe last two weeks have been so bad that I wasn't eating and slept as much as possible because being awake was impossible. My Xanax wasn't doing anything for me. And then I think since we're all going to die anyways, then what's the point in doing anything at all? It's extremely hard for me to have motivation or a hobby cause I don't see the point in any of it. And then that turns into me feeling like a loser and unworthy of other people because I'm boring and uninteresting. That's a whole different story though.... **Fucking anxiety am I right?** It's such a fucking joke feeling suicidal but also having a death phobia. HA. I was thinking how if I could run out into the street, get hit by a car, be put into a coma and dream the rest of my life away that I would be happy with that. This week however, my anxiety has eased up a bit. I'm not crying and having a panic attack every day thankfully, but I know it will return. I'm also bipolar so I think I'm on the opposite end now going up possibly into a manic episode.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**So now that I'm done venting... do any of you have this fear and how do you cope? How do you get it out of your head or feel at ease?**",

So, I have very bad health anxiety (or hypochondria) due to some complications I experienced with an ovarian tumour I had, about 4 years ago now. It was, luckily, a benign tumour that resulted in the removal of one of my ovaries, and that is that. It\u2019s had/continues to have lasting effects on both my physical and mental well-being, and generally makes me very paranoid and fearful for my life.\n\nNow, don\u2019t ask what triggered this thought process because I don\u2019t actually know for sure, but I somehow ended up on \u201cOvarian cancer\u201d symptoms and I have managed to scare myself into thinking that I may possibly have this. I _do_ have some of the associated symptoms which is my main concern, however I know that these could very well be to do with something entirely different. I think I will call the doc\u2019s on Monday just to make sure, however, I could do with a word of support or advice from anyone that\u2019s experienced something similar :) Cheers.",

I recognized he was trying to take advantage of me, so I held my ground. He then charged at me, invaded my personal space and threatened to knock me out. He also wasn't wearing a mask and was spitting everywhere, mind you.\n\nBut I wasn't even scared, or anxious. I was actually angry. My flight or flight clicked into fight for the first time in my life. He was a big guy and stood in my face and told me he was going to hit me, and I told him to just hit me. It's strange but as big as he was, he looked small to me. Like he couldn't even hurt me if he wanted to.\n\nAnyway, he stood down and I left, then told my boss about what happened and that I won't be going back. The panic began after the incident and is still happening right now.\n\nBut I hate bullies. I was abused and pushed around all my life. I am tired of living in fear.",

And since most people watch the news during tragedies, they try to make every news story feel like the end of the world so they can get that sweet ad revenue.\n\nBut in the process, you have scenarios like the one in the first paragraph.

            "selftext": "Hello everyone,\n\nI have anxiety related to work/study and intellectual performance. In the moments when I don't have a challenge, I feel perfectly fine and my mood is ok, but when I have to do something to do that requires using my intellectual skills I drown in shame even before I start and I self-sabotage myself with procrastination and canceling projects. I had some stress in the past two years and this is when this appeared and got stronger over the last year. I have been criticized during my childhood by a parent so this negative inside voice partially comes from there.  \n\n\nI  go in therapy, but the advice that I get and the inside voice of encouragement that I need to use in moments like this when I am stressed are impossible to listen to. When I am faced with a challenge I feel like a complete failure and I completely trust my negative thoughts that I cannot do anything, this is louder than the self-help techniques.  \nI take CBD oil and I recently started taking sleeping pills.  \n\n\nI really have trouble having positive thoughts and fighting anxiety in certain moments and I know that issues like this cannot be solved only with medicine but it takes work which I cannot seem to do.   \n\n\nAny advice or a technique that worked for you?",

She's been having a really hard time since the 10th, and I tried to help her long distance but it was useless and I can't even tell which one of her problems are real or not. \n\nIf you listen to her, everything in her life broke all at once, her keys were stolen, the fridge doesn't work or is poisoned, or it sometimes works, the stove smokes and sparks when she uses it and will explode the building, the outlets are not working, but they are sometimes working, or some are working, the cellphone charger is burnt out but it also works, but only in some outlets, but then it's lost, and then found, and then burnt out again, her pension is about to be cancelled, there is a problem with her taxes...all at once and she needs me to help her with all of that, and get a lawyer, and go to the federal government because only they can help her....\n\nAnd among all those problems, I know some may be real and most are not and some may be real but embellished with delusions because that's how she understands the world and everything gets added into the paranoid web of delusions, everything is related, connected, and has to do with her. \n\nI have no way of asessing the real situation over the phone and no friends or family to check on her, so I took time off work and now I'm traveling there to see her but I'm freaking out. Aside from travel being a horrible experience for me, always, her phone was dead all day yesterday, ever since the evening the day before, and I haven't been able to reach her, or confirm to her that I'm on my way. Normally we always talk when I leave and arrive.\n\n In only a couple of hours, I'll be there and will be able to see for myself whats going on, but my mind is filled with horror and I can't breathe. What if she electrocuted herself messing with her stove or her outlets? What if she fell and broke her neck? What if the last time I talked to her, I brushed her off because I was at work, tired and frustrated and she's been calling me literally up to 20 times a day for thr last 10 days at all hours of day and night, but that pushed her over the edge and she killed herself? What if I get there, and everything is broken but she refuses to replace anything or let the repair people in as she is suspicious of everyone? What if I get there and she doesn't let me in because she doesn't believe it's me? (Cuz she's already tried to make me recall obscure past events that only she knows about to prove I'm me). \n\nI feel like I might throw up, cry or scream right on the train. My head is dizzy and everything feels unreal, fake, like the train and the seats and the stuff outside is all flat and made of colored paper.",
