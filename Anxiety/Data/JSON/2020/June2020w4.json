            "selftext": "I\u2019m 30 years old, diagnosed with anxiety several years ago and on Buspar for it. Although I am not a super shy person and have what many people call an \u201cintimidating\u201d and \u201cfiery\u201d personality where I am always speaking my mind, I have never been good with speaking in groups. In college I gained a reputation among my peers and professors for never speaking in class, even though I was heavily involved in the subject matter. I always have things to say; they always sound great in my head and I can write them out very well, but when I start talking, I turn into a terrified, shaking mess. \n\nI was just on a Zoom call with a group related to activism. I hadn\u2019t said anything for the whole call even though I had ideas in my head. I couldn\u2019t do it. Then the moderator specifically addressed me because I was the only one that hadn\u2019t spoken. So I started...I tried so hard to convey the message I had been \u201cpracticing\u201d in my head the whole time and I just couldn\u2019t get it out. Even though this group was welcoming, and kind, and to be frank, a few of them didn\u2019t have anywhere near the level of knowledge that I do - I was almost stuttering, heart pounding, hands shaking, and I could barely form sentences. In a moment of panic, not knowing what to say, I just hit the leave meeting button, literally in the middle of my sentence. I\u2019ll say my phone died, I guess, if they ask me what happened. (Hopefully there\u2019s no way for the moderators to tell that I manually clicked the leave button...oh great, now I\u2019m panicking about that.)\n\nI am so tired of this. I\u2019m an intelligent person with things to say. I just have zero confidence when people are looking at me. I\u2019m terrified of being judged or saying some dumb. I can\u2019t be the person I want to be, in activism or in my profession, if this is always happening. I don\u2019t know what to do anymore.",

I think weekdays should be filled with taking care of your responsibilities of course,  but also with your favorite meals, books, tv shows, video games, etc. \nI feel like society tells us that it\u2019s admirable to be burnt out and that you\u2019ve given every last bit of yourself to your work or schooling, hardly eaten, and waved off simple pleasures in the name of productivity. But these little pleasures are what life is all about. And I\u2019ll be damned if I let anxiety or society tell me I can\u2019t have an extra special dressed up sandwich for lunch or take a bubble bath on a Wednesday night. \n\nWith anxiety and depression especially for me personally those little things can sometimes make the difference in how bad a day was. Just wanted to share in case anyone else does this to themselves...have the lunch you really want, play the video game, and let yourself smile like a kid again at the simplest joys of life.

            "selftext": "I started having anxiety around 2 years ago when I was 16 years old. There are periods of time where I would feel anxious and I have depressing thoughts, like thinking I had no real friends or a hopless future and stuff like that. I would have racing thoughts and felt like I had no control over them, so when I thought to myself for the first time that I wanted to die it was scary, but at the same time I kind of knew these suicidal thoughts were induced by anxiety and I would never kill myself.\n\nThis week has been one of the more rough ones. Two of my friends had their birthdays, so I ended up being heavily drunk on 3 out of 7 days. Eventhough alcohol usually silences my anxiety while im drunk, it gets way worse the next day, so it was only a given that something bad would happen at some point. Well I am at that point right now.\n\nWhat really kicked off the panic attack im having right now is the way one of my friends behaved last night. The problem is that he is straight and I am gay and I developed a huge crush on him like 4 years ago. I try to kill these feelings, I really do not want to love him, I hate myself for it. But I don't have much contact outside of my friend group so i dont meet a lot of guys, so im always kind of stuck with my feelings for him I guess.\n\nIn the last two years we grew a lot closer to each other. We're playing a lot of video games together online and often talk to each other. I really want to overcome my feelings for him, hoping I become really close friends with him, because I think he is a great person and I really want someone who I can talk with about my problems and struggles.\n\nWhat happened last night is that I got really drunk and he got somewhat too. At some point I blurted out, that I probably need to go to therapy because of my anxiety. (that was at that point really unalligned with the actual mood in the room but in my head it was the right time to say it)\n\nHe said: \"lol you're such a pussy\"\n\nHe later on told me out of context that I am a fucking idiot and later again said when I was talking that I really need to shut the fuck up.\n\nI don't know. Im overwhelmed with everything. I dont understand what I did so wrong that made him say these things to me. I don't know why I can't just stop loving him. I don't know what to do, what type of relationship with him would make me happy.\n\nAnd during all that confusion, my anxiety is going wild, fueled by all these negative emotions. For the first time, I feel like that these suicidal thoughts racing through my head are part of me. I can not differentiate between my own thoughts and my \"anxiety thoughts\" anymore. I've started to legitimately have the desire to hurt myself.\n\nBut I will still fight these thoughts. Tomorrow I will finally have the courage to ask my mother to help me set up an appointment with a psychatrist. And hopefully things will start to turn around in my life.\n\nTo the random person who read the whole thing, thank you for listening. I don't think need or want any advice. I just mainly needed to say these things \"out loud\". It really helped me dealing with the panic attack, I feel like its almost over now. \n\nOh and sorry for my bad english, im not a native speaker.",

The woman asked them to help her cross the river, now they have taken advanced vows and were not supposed to touch women. The older monk shrugged and guided the woman and put her on his back and  crossed the raging river. When they reached the other side, he put her down without a word and continued on. After a few hours, the younger monk asked him: You touched a woman, why did you do that? \n\nThe older monk answered:  we left her hours ago, why are you still carrying her? \n\nI dont know, there is something about this fable that made me think I am the one carrying all these things from the past that is making me suffer (anxiety and overthinking) maybe it helps to let it go and continue on like what the older monk did.",

Most of my anxiety stems from that phobia, but I also have significant anxiety about never being good enough, successful enough, etc. General anxiety. \n\nI\u2019ve gone to therapy for years, am on Prozac (it\u2019s helped), I work out, have a career, a stable relationship, and friends, but sometimes I feel overwhelmed by the thought that I\u2019ll have to feel like this forever. I\u2019m so tired of waking up everyday and having to stay constantly engaged so that I can function. I envy those who don\u2019t deal with this and often I feel depressed at the thought of spending decades of my life preoccupied with anxious thoughts. \n\nWith so much more discussion around mental health lately, it feels nice to open up, but I\u2019ve also noticed that so many people want to talk about their mild anxiety and in a way it still makes me feel uncomfortable about the fact that my anxiety is not like that. I know you guys know how bad anxiety can be, and it\u2019s hard to convey that to someone else often... like trying to explain my panic attacks every time I leave the house while trying to remain composed and friendly is overwhelming.  \n\nDo you ever feel so overwhelmed by the thought that you\u2019ll have to fight with anxiety for the rest of your life that you feel like eventually it\u2019ll be too much? I wonder if maybe this is just an obsessive thought of mine, but I often have suicidal thoughts because of this. I don\u2019t ever feel like I need to act on them, but they enter my brain almost daily.",

My anxiety is even causing stomach issues like acid reflux and it\u2019s honestly horrible and a cycle I don\u2019t know how to get out of! \n\nBut yesterday I randomly remembered that I owned an adult colouring book which I\u2019ve only used a couple of times (like years ago when I had purchased it). \n\nSo I sat down at my study table, dimmed the lights and played my favorite calming music (which is, not that anybody cares but, korean r&amp;b, but you can even play some soothing piano music on youtube, there\u2019s lots of amazing options. even rain sounds on YouTube!) and I just started colouring. I think I was colouring for an hour? All my anxiety and racing thoughts vanished. It was such a beautiful, calm hour. And I really want to tell you guys that this is always an option for when you feel anxious. Write it down somewhere just in case you forget that you can use this to calm yourself down!",

In the mornings I am completely fine but as the night time rolls around I start becoming anxious and questioning my health and that of my family. It of course doesn\u2019t help that I have been experiencing some chest / lung pain. I do not have any other symptoms other than the occasional scratchy throat, so I am attributing this to allergies/ the Saharan dust cloud that was happening and likely overworking my chest and back muscles in a workout a few days ago.  other than this discomfort, I feel okay. I just can\u2019t help but think about the unknown or the what if. Any advice is appreciated. Thank you!!",

I\u2019m 27(M) and these thoughts keep me up at night, during the day they stop me from pursuing any of my interests because I get overwhelmed with the thoughts and anxiety that in 20-25 years all of it will have been for nothing. I believe that the ultimate goal and purpose in life is creating happiness in your own life and how you live it. But with the way things are trending right now I struggle to envision a future that is full of happiness, a future for myself where anything I pursue will actually still matter or have any effect. I have things that I\u2019m passionate about but the anxiety of these thoughts that it will all be pointless and futile in my near future stop me from pursuing any of them. Sometimes it almost feels similar to playing a game you love, but you don\u2019t finish the final level because you never want the game to end. So you put it down and subconsciously satisfy yourself by never finishing it. Maybe if I never pursue these goals the future that looks so bleak in my mind will never come to pass. Maybe these goals I want to achieve and the person I want to be won\u2019t be futile and pointless in the near future because I never created that possible scenario of success and happiness in my mind in the first place. What\u2019s the point in putting so much effort towards something when the future looks hopeless?",
