            "selftext": "I\u2019ve been struggling with anxiety for 5 years now . Even though it\u2019s not as bad as it was before, it\u2019s still there. \n\nA while ago during one of my anxiety attacks and a usual dose of self hate and criticism, something in my mind clicked. My brain was being a toddler. I decided to try something new. I thought about it and realized that my anxiety was basically a toddler with major temper problems. I separated myself from myself to talk  to myself in my mind with the tone one would use when confronting a toddler. \n\nSay, for example, I\u2019m panicking about visiting a friend. Me panicking was that toddler throwing a tantrum and refusing to go anywhere. I\u2019d use my voice of reason and talk to this toddler in my head in a calm voice. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you want to go see your friend?\u201d this would prompt me to think about a valid reason. I\u2019d \u2018listen\u2019 to the reasons and rationalize them and give a response to the toddler to help deal with being afraid of going to see a friend. Explain in a calm voice and try to not lose your cool because if you lose your cool, you\u2019d have an upset toddler who wouldn\u2019t listen. Be patient. The more you listen, comfort care for and try to help the toddler, the behavior of the toddler would get better and the \u2018tantrums\u2019 would decrease. \n\nI have no idea if this makes sense to anybody reading but I hope it helps in some way. I\u2019m not sure what doing this would be called though lol. Doing this has helped me avoid many more anxiety attacks. Though it mightn\u2019t be completely effective, it could help in some way!",

I ask myself why the hell am I talking to anyone, why would they care about what I have to say\n\nI believe I have to cut everyone out of my life, I start deleting apps, removing myself from group. I'm so close to just snapping and telling everyone to stay away from me\n\nI'm crying constantly, my head tells me I'm worthless, ill never amount to anything, everyone worries about me and they will so angry when you realise they're worrying over a nobody\n\nI genuinely feel like I am an awful human being, I should subject anyone to me and I should hide or just die.\n\nI fight so hard to overcome it, I force myself to interact with people, to go into work calls but I just... Don't exist. I actually wonder if I'm a ghost. I'll write messages (trying to be happy and light hearted) and it'll be ignored and the subject will be completely changed.\n\nI try so so hard to be a good and kind person (because it doesn't actually feel natural, I have consciously be nice like wtf is wrong with me) and I find out people are actually uncomfortable with me and I'm too nice and giving.\n\nI don't actually know who or what to be because everything I do is just not good enough.\n\nSometimes I can cope through it. I can gaslight myself \"no, you took that the wrong way\", \"no, they are just naturally good enough. You have to try harder\" until I'm hit with actual stress and I just snap.\n\nI can't stop crying, my mood fluctuates so much I need a mood tracker, I'm self harming\n\nI'm actually scared, I don't know what to do and I don't have anyone to turn too because literally everyone around me struggles with mental health and I can't add to their stress.\n\nI don't actually feel safe because I know now I feel somewhat normal but if I crash again I don't know what happens.

            "selftext": "So a little background on me: I\u2019m 23, just graduated college in June, and my life has been completely derailed by the pandemic. I was dealing with some bad health anxiety and generalized anxiety during my senior year after a bad experience with MDMA left me with months of brain fog and visual disturbances, and just as I was starting to get better the pandemic hit. In the space of a week I go from having a promising future ahead of me to just disappointment and misery with seemingly no end. My graduation was cancelled, and was rescheduled to next year (but probably won\u2019t happen if the current vaccine timeline is correct). I got accepted to journalism school at Columbia University, but ultimately had to turn it down because I didn\u2019t think it was wise to pay such high tuition for what would possibly be more online classes, which I absolutely hated. I was supposed to move out and start and exciting new life, but that\u2019s not happening anymore. And to top it all off I can\u2019t even get a journalism internship, just rejection after rejection. \n\nNow the fall is coming and I\u2019m feeling completely miserable. The summer was ok, since I live in New York State and I felt relatively safe with the low cases and the opportunity to do stuff outdoors. But now, since my family is all public school teachers the small circle of people i was in contact with is now high risk and I don\u2019t feel safe seeing them, especially since my niece and nephew are attending preschool unmasked. My mom and dad are fed up with my worrying about long term effects, and I have essentially decided to isolate in my own house since my older parents refuse to see the risk in having said niece and nephew come over to play indoors multiple times per week. \n\nI might try to go back to journalism school next fall, but who\u2019s to say it won\u2019t be more of the same online bullshit? I just feel so upset knowing that probably 2 whole years of my life were just thrown away at the drop of a hat, and when this ends I\u2019ll be so far behind in starting my adult life. I\u2019ve only been on one date in my life, and I\u2019ll have missed out on two more years to do that. I can\u2019t shake the feeling that what should\u2019ve been the best years of my life were completely wasted and I\u2019ll never be able to make them up. I\u2019m trying to cope by reading and writing and watching movies but it all feels so futile since I\u2019m worried this will never end and even if it does I\u2019m just going to have to prepare to drop my life on short notice for a few more years. How should I deal with this situation, and how should I have any sort of hope for the future? \n\n[TL; DR: Recent college grad, entire life was derailed by pandemic. Feel like my best years are wasted and I\u2019m going to miss out on adulthood because of quarantine. Have to completely self-isolate for months since family isn\u2019t taking risks seriously. How to feel like life is worth living at all?]",

It is really hard but I'm hoping it gets even better from here. I'm noticing small things like sure I still bawl my eyes out with any confrontation, but I don't do it as quickly or as hard as I used to. I can start to process some of my feelings even when I'm emotional. \n\nThe realization that my emotions aren't a problem just occurred to me at 23 years old lol. \n\nAnxiety is a bitch but its so much more manageable than it used to be.",

It was a slow day in the server, not much going on, and there were few people talking about an unreleased asset (things like weapon skins, etc.) in the game files. They mentioned things like unpackeing the game so, I butted in and said \"Why use an unpacker to rip the game, if you can simply get the assets right away in a site\". I was smart enough not to give any direct links, but someone pinged and asked me if I tried downloading from said site, I said yes then I got promptly ip blocked from that server.\n\nMod says that what I did can be considered \"game hacking\" and an attempt to infringe copyright by datamining. Now obviously, any rationale sane person will laugh this bullshit claim off, but my stupid anxious brain is taking over and overthinking.\n\nI'm overthinking way too much for this, I can't sleep right now, my brain goes thinking: \"What if the game company takes action, they have my ip address on record, we might receive letters in the mail soon\". \"Fuck, I cloned the repo with my personal account, they might find out my email, my identity and press charges\"\n\nI fucking can't stop overthinking.

Lockdown has had a worse effect on me than I thought bc I've apparently reverted on all the progress I had made up till March when everything shut down. It's been a hard couple of weeks to say the least.\n\nBut yesterday my therapy place finally called back! They're a student clinic so the therapists are grad students supervised by licensed psychotherapists, but my therapist last year rly helped me! I'm still a little nervous about how my new therapist might be like but generally I'm so proud of myself for recognizing I needed help, reaching out early on and not waiting until it gets worse. I'm also relieved to have this weight taken off my shoulders! I can't wait to get help, lord knows I need it haha",

            "selftext": "So recently I\u2019ve been getting a lot of anxiety. I\u2019m 14 and it started on my birthday when i first smoked weed (please don\u2019t judge me bro i regret it sm) \nI always feel like i\u2019m in a dream since then and i keep having panic attacks thinking i have memory loss or thinking i\u2019m going crazy or i\u2019m gonna die\nIf my mind doesn\u2019t stop racing, which it doesn\u2019t, i have an attack about it.. \nI can literally be thinking about anything and I\u2019ll get scared, and think that i\u2019m overthinking too much...\nOne thing i\u2019m also really scared about is self harm and suicide... I really don\u2019t think i\u2019d ever do it but when i get the panic attacks (which usually happen everyday) it\u2019s like i\u2019d do anything to stop them. \nI got one the other day and i had a cramp while i was going through it and it took my mind off it for a bit until i started thinking \u201cWell what if i just hurt myself a little, it\u2019s not like i\u2019d commit suicide and it might take my mind off it..\u201d After thinking that these panic attacks just got worse and worse, because on top of everything else,,, i\u2019m terrified i\u2019m going to hurt myself.. \nI\u2019m also really scared this isn\u2019t going to stop.. I want. life and career and husband I don\u2019t want to have to deal with this shit i\u2019ve been going through it for about 3 weeks and i\u2019ve already had enough.. And everything i read says it\u2019s not going to go away... this just scares me even more...\nThis might seem rude but knowing other people are going through this the same as i am or even worse helps me a lot... It makes me feel like i\u2019m not alone..\n\nLast night i came to the revelation that nobody really knows me. I never speak outside of my mind, and when i say never i really mean never... I\u2019ll go on a day to day basis saying the necessities like \u201cThank you\u201d \u201cYou\u2019re welcome\u201d \u201cyes \u201cno\u201d \u201ci don\u2019t know\u201d and i\u2019ll answer questions if people ask them... but i never speak besides that and that scares me\n\nabsolutely nobody knows ME\n\ni don\u2019t know when this started or if i was always like this... everything is just all f\u00fccked up \n\nplease tell me i\u2019m not alone bro I can\u2019t even focus on the simplest shit\n\ni remember scrolling through insta or something and i\u2019d see someone talking about having an anxiety attack and i\u2019d think \u201cOh it can\u2019t be that bad...\u201d\n\nit really fucking is that bad \n\nI\u2019d also see people being happy that they didn\u2019t self harm and id think \u201cWell i\u2019d you\u2019re happy about not doing it why would you do it in the first place.. why would you do something that makes you unhappy?\u201d \n\nAnd it scares me because i understand why they would do it now.. I mean i haven\u2019t done it but I understand why... \n\nI really fucking hope someone sees this I really don\u2019t want to be alone anymore. Please rant in the comments about what it\u2019s like for you, get it all out... it may help you.. i don\u2019t know.. but what i do know is it will definitely help me.",

            "selftext": "Heeey\nIt's my first time posting something on here (I'm french btw, sorry if I make mistakes)\n\nA lot happened in my life recently. I'm 19 and just got to realise how stressful the world, life, really is. I've been pretty confused and stressed out about my studies (among other things). What drives me? What do I want to do in life? What if I never find out about that? What if I can't find a job? What if I end up lost? Unhappy? Unfulfilled?\n\nI realised I was not feeling okay with what I started studying this new year (it's been one month going back to class for me - also, i was studying something else last year so you can get how lost I really am) so I decided to quit. I'm going to give myself some rest. Learn to live again. To explore, to get to know myself, to become more independant... That's why I finally am taking a gap year.\n\nIt was really hard to announce it to my mom. She is not a really \"sensitive\" and sympathetic person (or at last does not seem like it)... \nWe were in the car with my sister when I told her what I wanted to do now (and before that, I was feeling depressed for days as I was so lost, quite conflicted and my mom wanted to force me to keep on with these studies).\nIt was so hard to get the words out of my mouth. This whole day in class I was picturing so clearly what would happen at that moment, in the car with her, I had my arguments, it was so convincing in my mind! But facing the situation in real life was nothing alike. I should have expected that. It took time but I eventually opened up and explained the whole thing to her. \nShe showed some reluctance, started talking loud (that's just how she is).\nI was trying hard to explain to her how anxious I was feeling and why I really thought it was the best solution for me to take this break. And then I told her something my therapist told me (I just had my first therapy this Monday and it already helped me a lot, and made me realize so much) about how I had this feeling of being abandoned (would need another post to explain all that! But some family issues - some little \"childhood trauma\" consequences, if you know, you know).\nShe took it personally, said something like she never abandoned me and my sister and giving arguments to explain herself... \n\nand then it just happened. \n\nAnd you know it is something I've heard about so much, read about, seen on tv... but in a way I never thought it could actually happen to me. It is so weird to even think about it again. \nI started crying and wheezing (and thought: okay I've been crying a lot these past days, it is just happening once again) but it was so out of control. And it was like having pins and needles in my hands and face (i don't know how to say it in other words, especially in a language that is not my first one) and it was like my hands were paralyzed in a way. Of course my mom got scared, my sister later told me she was crying on the backseat, seeing me like that. My mom was saying \"ok, fine you'll quit!\" but that was not making me feel any better honestly, just even more anxious about the fact that I'm disappointing her... she even stopped the car.\n\nI eventually got better. Then we talked again and things finally turned out to be fine. In a way I feel like I'm a bit happy that it happened (the attack... because it helped making my mom realize how bad i've been actually feeling). I know, I should not think that. And now I'm kinda scared that this just opened a door to more anxiety attacks and that it is just the beginning of it. Like, when it happened once, this is just the start, there is no way you can get back to how you were before.\nI'm writing way too much. I'll talk about it with my therapist anyway. But I feel like finding a certain community on reddit could also be a good therapy (Like talking to people that can relate to me, and that I can relate to, you know?). It's been a long time in my life feeling a certain lack of \"connection\" with people (maybe because I'm way too socially anxious). I do have friends but... I just don't really feel connected if that makes sense.\n\nI spent a lot of time reading people's stories on here before finally creating an account and posting for the first time (i still don't really know how reddit works tbh \ud83d\ude02). It is like a new chapter of my life has began though. \n\nSo thank you to anyone who's read my very - not so short - first experience with having an anxiety attack! That is very nice of you. I spent so much time writing this and I'm going to bed now (hoping to see some answers tmrw, we never know!)",

During these times I can do very little other than lay around in bed. No matter how many times I go through something, the worst case scenario thoughts never get any better. It's hell. I would rather feel depressed than be worried about something catastrophic or upsetting happening.   \n\n\nI generally don't like posting in groups, but I just want to know if anyone else experiences anxiety the same way that I do.

            "selftext": "I\u2018m 22. I\u2019ve suffered from anxiety + depression since 2011. In 2014, PTSD was thrown into the mix.\n\nI just think my existence is a huge mistake and I am not meant to be here. I am terrified of other humans. I haven\u2019t had a real job, other than working for my parents. This obviously doesn\u2019t help with my self-esteem. I graduated high school early and have not been to college, again, due to my anxiety.\n\nI don\u2019t understand how I\u2019m supposed to survive when I can\u2019t do the two basic things that everyone else seemingly does with ease. I also need to do those two things to live.\n\nI don\u2019t want to blame my parents, but they were very uninvolved in my life (too busy with work), so I feel like I had a loooot more \u201calone time\u201d than others growing up. Once I graduated high school, I feel like I was left like there was no longer this illusion of structure to hold me up, so I basically just fell into the pit of anxiety and depression, spending all day alone and in my head.\n\nThat\u2019s why it has gotten really bad since graduating high school. The worst it has ever been. I\u2019ve been in therapy for almost 4 years, and while she helped me so much at first, I feel like she has turned into a... friend? She was recommend by family. She no longer has her license. I see her at her house since she lives nearby. I love our conversations. She does hold me accountable. But I feel like the boundaries have been blurred. For example, I can text her whenever I want and she\u2019ll respond. I think this has left me texting her when I should be utilizing coping mechanisms.\n\nBut what do you know? I\u2019m too anxious to bring this up to her.\n\nI\u2019m too anxious for anything. I remember that I exist and it makes me feel like I\u2019m on the brink of a panic attack. Sometimes just perceiving everything overwhelms me, like I\u2019m being suffocated by stimuli.\n\nI don\u2019t know what to do. I was young enough to remember the entire \u201cit gets better\u201d phase that was happening a few years ago and... it\u2019s only gotten so much fucking worse. So much worse than I could have even imagined.\n\nAnd then I wonder: is this a self-fulfilling prophecy? Am I just doing this to myself? But I\u2019m suffering, why would I want to suffer? No. I want to live. But I\u2019m being bombarded by messages that tell me it\u2019s my fault, that I have to help myself, as if I haven\u2019t been trying.\n\nA million realities and perspectives bombard my head by the fucking second. What this person sees. What the other sees. What they think. How they\u2019ll react. What it\u2019ll mean.\n\nThe only times I\u2019ve ever felt relief from this are when I took a bar of Xanax or Vyvanse. Which I think are both controlled substances? And highly addictive? And don\u2019t last as long as I need them to?\n\nSo then I think about how it is actually possible to exist in the headspace I desire but I\u2019ll only ever achieve it short-term and through a pill... it makes me want to cry. \n\nI just feel like I\u2019m suffocating and drowning. I want it to end.\n\nI have no talents, I have no qualities, no strengths. Nothing to give anyone. I\u2019m just a ball of anxiety and fear, and I don\u2019t belong here.",

Can someone explain, Help?\n\nHey guys 21 m here help me out\n\nCan someone explain me what this is, \n\nI feel on autopilot all the time for the past 10-20 days. I don't feel anything much. I do feel really depressed or my emotions suppressed,  I sometimes  feel like what's happening around me feels so unreal or just weird. Like i'll be laughing and talking but in within a moment i feel numb. \n\nBut more importantly this feeling is what I don't understand, i am zoned out alot, i am doing things normally and suddenly realise i have been zoned out or i feel like i just got out of zoning out, and before i know it i am  again zoning out, like it happens constantly i guess, even right now maybe\n\nAnd this feeling like I'm talking to someone, (i can hardly keep up the convo, I've noticed i forget things while I'm speaking in a long sentence) . So i'm talking to someone, normally it appears normal , maybe cause I'm speaking in autopilot, and after speaking I walk away  and when i think or look back , I'm like did i just have the convo? Felt so weird, like did i or not? I clearly remember i did, but I don't feel it, and this is not just with talking to people but with everything else. Like i drive which suddenly feels  overwhelming and I suddenly reach my destination,  or even the smallest things, like I'm in the washroom doing my business i come out and sit and feel like did i just go or not? Like i did go, but it feels weird like I didn't feel it\n\nGUYS PLEASE HELP ME EXPLAIN THIS I HAVE BEEN FEELING THIS FOR THE LAST 10-20 days. \n\nI had a breakup for month which was really stressful, i was in a toxic relationship where we fought physically too but always made up, holding on to the breakup was painful cause i kept going to her and got rejected so came home feeling numb couple of times. And cried alot too, didn't sleep properly for a week(4/5 hours) , which actually triggered this , and i had left weed, 1/2 years ago which triggered a bit of anxiety. I have patched up now and things are great but i've been experiencing this and feel totally numb even around her. which is really disappointing cause I don't feel engaged i want to engage. I don't feel engaged with my environment too, things get slightly better for a few hours and really foggy or disoriented at times. \n\nPLEASE HELP ME OUT GUYS",

I really don\u2019t understand how people get so hyped for it when I\u2019m struggling to not shit my pants during the game. I even usually do really good on those, but the fact that you can tell EXACTLY who got it wrong just by the color of their screen is terrifying. I don\u2019t think I can listen to it without cringing anymore. I was hoping by junior year we\u2019d be done with that but ig not. My leg bounce is never as intense as it is during a game of Fucking kahoot",
