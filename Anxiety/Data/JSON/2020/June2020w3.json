Naturally she worked at walmart so I'm not surprised she got it and she was one of the first people to bolt when they opened up the town. I live in Texas so everything was back open super early. My mom didnt wear a face mask nor did she care about social distancing. And how she has it. And she said that the nurses said I most likely have it too and I should go be tested. Shes acting like it's not a big deal like people are dying everyday from this shit. My stepdad said shes fine shes only 30 so she wont die but my little brother (her son) has asthma and my little sister get sick easy. So yes SHE will be fine but what about us. I have general anxiety and ever since Covid  started and I soon realized how fucking dumb my family is, my anxiety has gotten worse. And now that I might have it and I've been feeding my dogs and touching things and not knowing that I might have it is making me freak the fuck out. And my mom who Definitely has it not do the right precautions is just tipping the scale. I feel like bursting out crying every 5 seconds because who know how long shes had it and how many people shes spread it too. She went grocery shopping today and idk what did she touch did she wear hand sanitizer and my stepdad is like \"Covid isnt that bad the flu is worst  so fuck facemask\" I feel overwhelmed and stressed and idk what to do.

            "selftext": "I've had anxiety for as long as I remember. As a child, I was constantly worried about my parents dying. Then it became about getting into trouble with the police/school. I used to pretend to vomit every Monday morning so I could stay home, as the world was just too scary. \n\nAt 13, I was diagnosed with emetophobia (fear of vomitting), and I completely shut myself off from all socializing activities because of it. I did have friends, but I never went the cinema, out shopping etc etc because I was too scared of being sick. \n\nThis then transpired into a general fear of panic attacks, most notably a fear of being in public in case I had a panic attack and looked stupid. This made Uni lectures very difficult. It made exams difficult. It's something I still have - i \"plan exit routes\" from every place I ever go into. \n\nEx-partners have commented on how much effort it takes to deal with me basically, with my ex-boyfriend I was paranoid he would crash his car, as he used to drive home from our dates at like 4am, and I thought he'd fall asleep at the wheel. I was constantly worrying about him. I feel like my neuroticism came across negatively to him, and maybe he found me really annoying. So I've decided at 24, that I won't get into another relationship. \n\nWhen I dont have work or uni (im doing a Masters atm), I sleep. I can't do anything else. If I don't sleep, I panic - so what's the point? I get about 2 hours between 9pm and 11pm where I feel calm as the days over, but when I am falling asleep I can feel my heart pounding again, dreading the next day. \n\nA lot of my anxiety comes from seeing topical things in the news, and applying them to my life, if that makes sense. I will always find an example from my past to become \"guilty\" The last 1 weeks have just been the worst I've ever experienced with this. The basic outline is: \n\n1. **(Monday - Wednesday) Fear that my relationship failed because of my racial discrimination**: I am following as everyone is, in utter disgust at how complacent white people have been in response to the Black community's appalling treatment. My ex was Black and experienced fucking hideous treatment - driving with him, we were pulled over 4 times in a 5 month period - I've never been stopped before. We always discussed race openly, and the difficulties that he was experiencing with a relationship with a white women. We broke up 6 months ago, his decision (posted about ex before for the backstory as to why). Now, for the last 3 months I have been at peace with his decision, even though it broke my heart. Now that little voice has started: *\"It's because you were racist to him, it's because he felt like you thought you were better than him. You're a racist. You're gonna have to pay for that. You'll lose your job.\"* (and this one's fucking annoying because AS IF a white woman should be making this about herself) \n2. **(Monday - Wednesday) Fear that I have plagiarized my whole dissertation:** I am completing my second Masters. I am a high scoring student. I know what plagiarism is and I would never do it. Yet, I have googled (individually) every. single. sentence. in my 35,000 dissertation and started rewording them all because I am scared it will flag up. \n3. (**Wednesday) Fear that past one-night stands were lying about their age:** when I moved to my current city, I didn't know anyone so went on Tinder. Obviously matched with people my age plus (24 and over). I matched with one guy who I ended up sleeping with for a while, and we sent each other nudes. I haven't thought about this guy for a very long time (was 3 years ago). Now that little voice in my head has started: *\"How can you ever really know ANYONE's age, without asking for their ID? You saw all your exes driving license, but you didn't see his!!! Sure, he said he was 30 and he looked it, but are you SURE? What happens if he just looks older? You've committed a crime!!!! You're going to be locked up.*\" This came from seeing a new story about a webcam girl who was jailed for not verifying ages for her shows.  \n4. **(Thursday - today) Fear that I have advanced decay and need all my teeth taken out:** I have had one filling in my whole life. I look after my teeth. I have a slight inflammation on my gum and a chip on my front tooth. I've spent 7 hours today googling images and videos of teeth extraction. I've calculated costs for extraction, implants and how I would get it/when. I am convinced that I will end up looking like someone who takes drugs with no teeth, lose my job, end up alone and unattractive and unable to afford new teeth. I have a dental appointment tomorrow and I am convinced they will pull my teeth. This came from the news that dentists are allowed to reopen after lockdown, and that there will be significant damage to vasts proportions of the population because of the 3 month closure. \n5. **(Thursday - today) Fear that I've made a mistake in a previous job and a lawsuit is being filed against me.** This is a general one that usually rears its head every so often. I've worked in so many jobs were this is the case. E.g. previously in a drug store where we had a Challenge25 policy. Always thought I was going to fail to ask someone who was underage and therefore get a hefty fine. Another time, I took a job as a carer but left after my first shadowing shift due to what I thought was inadequate care for a lady (not bad, but not caring or compassionate) - I always think that company will eventually get into trouble and my name will be affiliated with them and I will be prosecuted (which is obviously not true, as I didn't do anything, worked for 1 shadow shift and quit because I felt like it wasn't caring enough).\n\nThese are just the \"big\" anxieties that cause me massive panic attacks, crying fits and vomiting throughout the day. There are more, but they're more general ones (about my parents dying for example). \n\nI have high doses of Propranolol and Sertraline (i've been on every AD in the past). I also have had CBT and counselling. It's made a small dent in the anxiety, but not much. \n\nI just feel like my life is unbearable. I know this is anxiety, but when I am \"in it\" it's so hard to see past that, and to see it as being irrational - it's like all of the above is TRUE and WILL DEFINITELY happen, and I feel so fucking helpless. I am ruining my own life and I don't know what to do. \n\nHas anyone got any advice? Or experiences similar? \n\n**TL;DR: my anxiety is spiraling thinking that I have made massive (sometimes criminal) past errors that will come back to haunt me, and it's ruining my life**",

I'm nlt trying to be rude, I do value the friendship and never ignore them face to face or when they text something important or urgent, but sometimes I just don't feel like answering to you because text is a massive source of anxiety to me because I hate the idea of being available 24/7. Yeah I might be online and not busy, but me not wanting to answer has nothing personal to do with the person. Yet people do it so effortlessly, opening your text and leaving you on read and once again I don't care but once you're the one doing it to them they get mad. \n\n\n(I'm so anxious about it that I do actually answer all my text as soon as I read them)\n\nEdit : I feel like my post came across as me never answering the text. I answer right away urgent text. I answer under 24 hours for not urgent text. My problem is on messaging app without the \"seen\" option you can read it and answer later and everybody is fine, but for some reason the \"online\" and \"seen\" options make people think you're ignoring them when I'm just treating it like normal text messages.",

            "selftext": "There are countless resources, books, videos and analyses of how anxiety, OCD torture people for years.\n\nOne of the worst habits, the most depressing one, causing the highest sustained damage and singly maintaining your misery due to anxiety and worry, is **the habit of cautioning yourself in the belief that cautioning is beneficial or that it will protect you**.\n\n**It does neither**. It only uses your memory and your inherent mammalian ability to fear, in combination, against you, to keep you in a loop of self-inflicted fear, suffering and misery.\n\nIf in addition you have panic disorder, OCD or have faced betrayal, trauma or violence, those get added on to this memory link chain, in the false pretext of protecting you by cautioning yourself, and grind your sanity to fine dust.\n\nDon't do it.\n\nDon't caution yourself. Let risks remain and train to live with uncertainty - don't take life seriously, take it less seriously each day.\n\nDon't see only the dangers. See the positives too.\n\nDon't caution yourself, encourage and praise yourself too and don't end sentences in \"but, again, ...\"  No. Don't do that. Stop that. Start saying \"no buts, it'll work out, period.\"\n\nStop using threats and cautions in place of legitimate reminders to do things.\n\nDon't self-motivate by fear, threats and warnings. That's using the cruel Theory X of (de) \"motivation\"  against yourself. Use the Theory Y - encourage, allow calculated risks, allow failures, allow creativity, say \"no\" and \"stop\" regularly and firmly.\n\nIt can be done.\n\n**1000s of people recover from anxiety each year. This time, why not you?**\n\nYes, they relapse after a few years, but they recover again, and they spend those few years with 5-10% of their worst anxiety days. So why not you? They were all as or more miserable than you are today.\n\nI, for one, was. And now look at me, talking impossible stuff, almost lying to your faces.\n\nEither I must be a troll, or there must be some truth to what I'm saying.\n\nWhat if there is?\n\nWe're all in this together because all our patterns of suffering and recovery are studied and solved, and many of our behvaiours and problems are the same.\n\n----\n\n*Recovery is real. It's not a distant fantasy of the lucky few. It is the eventual destiny of many miserable wrecks like we have all been.*\n\nHappy recovery!",
