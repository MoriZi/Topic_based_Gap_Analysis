He just wanted to make sure I was okay and calming down.\n\nThank you to all of y'all out there doing this for us. This shit is hard. Mentally draining.

It seemed out of no where my mental health started making things that were once easy, very very hard. It's taken a toll on my self esteem. I'm starting over with everything. Myself, my home, my career, my education, my health, my relationships, nothing is the same. I've been battling bipolar depression, panic attacks, schizophrenia episodes, constant suicidal ideation and started 2020 in a mental hospital begging to just die. I've lost my identity in the process of everything. I've never been more scared. I'm trying medication again, I'm back in therapy and am having more good days. I'm working on reaching out more to people.  I'm thankful for those who made my quarantine birthday special. My mom made me a home made birthday cake with all my favorite things, my boyfriend had a paint night with me, my sister ordered me dinner to enjoy at home and the birthday wishes from everyone did not go unnoticed. I'm thankful to still be here, still trying, and still fighting &amp; I'm thankful for those that haven't given up on me when I've given up on myself. Here's to 25 and the rest of my life. \ud83e\udd73\ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffb",

I'm essentially convinced that everyone hates me and a lot of that is rooted in social anxiety and feelings of incompetency. I've never tried to make friends because I feel that they will not like me. I can't hang out in social groups because I feel that I act awkward, and I'm afraid that if I act awkward that I will be socially rejected. This really affects my life and my relationships with people-- I basically always feel incompetent. I interpret other's behavior through a very biased lens that harms me. My self esteem largely relies on how others feel about me (or rather how I think others feel about me). \n\nI don't know what to do anymore. This is a big struggle for me. I've attended therapy before, and it's obvious to me that much of this stems from unresolved childhood issues, but idk. I'm just wondering if there's anyone who feels like this because this makes me feel kinda ashamed and dumb.",

            "selftext": "So about 3 weeks ago I started getting these attacks that'd last 2-3 hours, and occur 3 times a day on average. I immediately started on Clonazepam because I just couldn't handle them, I even called 911 twice and ordered ambulances (I thought I was having heart attacks).\n\nI quit the Clonazepam 4 days ago (after having used it for 2 1/2 weeks) since I don't want to become dependent on it. I've seen Benzo damage first hand (dad tried to kill himself, withdrew for about 2 years in total).\n\nToday I woke up at 3AM and had a 3 hours panic attack and handled it like a boss. I deconstructed each symptom, tried to relax, did breathing exercises, put a Clonazepam pill on my table to assure myself (but I didn't take it).\n\n**It was hard as fuck but DAMN DOES IT FEEL SATISFYING!**",

I got chills and aches and my breathing was getting more difficult. Hmm maybe the flu? Back to my phone.\n\n\nStill couldn\u2019t breathe , now sweating and coughing harder. Hearts racing and on the floor scared and crying because breathing becoming impossible.\n\nI went and had a hot bath, drank hot tea , then went to bed .. where I had the worst night of my life .\n\nI couldn\u2019t sleep... I was up for 72 hours exhausted in cold sweats with breathing troubles . I finally called the nurses line and told them I was afraid I had Coronavirus.\nWe talked and they said to get to the hospital if I got worse , but to phone beforehand so they could prepare for me. \n\nMy heart sunk and my symptoms got worse. I cried as my kids slept, positive this was the end... I didn\u2019t want to kiss them and infect them, i kept leaving the room and taking deep breaths so I wouldn\u2019t drop dead. I texted my family that I loved them and was sorry for everything I had ever done. \n\n\nI finally passed out , then woke up and immediately ran to the bathroom where I threw up . I hadn\u2019t eaten in 2 days and still puked my guts out.\nChest still hurt, still having cold sweats and still coughing .. and now nauseated with a bad stomach. Maybe I won\u2019t even make it to the hospital. \n\n\nI watched a cnn video of one of their reporters who was sick with covid. He showed some breathing Exercises  and said To put your arms around your head and to hold it there . I kept doing that over and over and felt better each time. \nDidn\u2019t feel like I was dying as bad as a few nights before .\n\nHowever each time I read the news my symptoms got worse and my panicking was like nothing I\u2019ve experienced before .. I took some medicine and I cried myself to sleep. I finally slept.. briefly . I then woke up and had a bunch of mucus come up my throat and I began choking on it ..\nIt wouldn\u2019t stop coming up and my chest pains started up. \nThey called me and my covid test was scheduled for the next day. \n\nI took some mucus cold medicine which seemed to help as I slept for the first time since this hell started.. and I woke up feeling good. No coughing .. no cold sweats... no puking. Chest was still tight but I slept and that\u2019s just what I needed.\n\nMy test was at 1 and I was nervous , I pulled up and everyone was covered and masked up and I felt so alone.\nThey asked about my symptoms as well as if I had depression or anxiety... both of which I do. They checked my temperature, my blood pressure, my throat and swabbed my throat and both nostrils.\n\nI said I didn\u2019t sleep much and I was spending about 13 hours a day on the news.. mainly watching New York City and Italy.\nThe doctor stopped by and said DO NOT.. watch any news outside of where you live (our province) she said \u201cwatch/read only your province news as everything else will only make your anxiety worse than ever.. Just focus on keeping yourself and everyone around you safe. Keep washing your hands frequently and stay indoors and away from others.. and that includes your grandma\u201d \nShe is my grandmas doctor and knows how close we were. \n\nI went home and cleaned and for the first time .. stayed off international news. That was a few days ago and I have yet to go back on any... and I haven\u2019t had a single anxiety attack since. All my symptoms besides chest pain went away... when I start to think about it again (like right now) they come back a bit .. so I\u2019ll turn a movie on and they go away.\n\nSo when I got my results I just thought wow\nAnxiety is one of the scariest things... I truly thought I was going to die.\n\nI know there\u2019s a lot of scary horrible things going around our world right now , and I hope it is over soon, but watching the news 24/7 isn\u2019t going to help anything especially if you are mentally ill like me.\n\nThe best thing we can do, is stay busy and stay safe and stay off the international news .\n\nI just wanted to post this incase anyone was like me browsing here wondering if you have anxiety or if it\u2019s covid...\n\nAnxiety is a true evil and will make you think you have whatever it is you\u2019re scared of. \nDeep breaths and put your focus elsewhere.. like a meditation app.\n\nThinking of you all.

Everyday I\u2019m reading more and more about how this virus cannot be stopped, it\u2019s surviving longer and longer, they keep pushing the stay in dates, longer and longer, just lying to us so we stay calm when it\u2019s going to be lock down until like 2021/22. I\u2019m worried that riots are going to start, break ins also, worried about my grandparents because they will be targeted first. This world feels like it\u2019s ending too me. I\u2019m trying to stay positive for my girlfriend, and all my animals. I\u2019m scared a war can start from this and I\u2019ll just be drafted and whisked away to die, I\u2019ve been depressed for a couple years now and it\u2019s getting harder to see a light at the end of the tunnel. Like what is even happening right now? It doesn\u2019t seem real, we just got fucked. No one ever believed this could happen to us...",
