My anxiety has started getting really bad again. I just got a new medication and I l am open to trying it seriously\n\nHowever I still can\u2019t help but be hesitant hearing about the sexual side effects. Like having a sex drive is one of my favorite parts of being alive. And while my anxiety has impacted it. I\u2019d still rather try to do something else.\n\nI know that with cognitive behavioral therapy it can be just as effective if not more\n\nthis is kind of a dumb question to ask because I know I should be taking my medication that my doctor prescribed. But is there any luck with trying to make lifestyle changes and doing other methods as apposed to medication. In the case of severe anxiety",

            "selftext": "Hi, one of my anxiety triggers is stomach aches. I don\u2019t like stomach aches because I am very much afraid of vomiting. So I associate stomach aches with vomiting. Even though I have not vomited in like 7 years, I still fear it. So every time I get a stomach ache I also start to get anxiety. It is not always bad. Although since my stomach aches can last a while my anxiety tends to fluctuate. So when I am feeling my worst with my stomach ache such as feel like I am going to vomit then my anxiety picks up too. I get sweaty feet and hands. My heart rate goes up and I start to have some thoughts of what is going to happen such as vomit. The thoughts are not good because I just scare myself in which makes my anxiety worse. I have always felt like this. Since I can remember. Maybe because I can specifically remember the 4 times I have vomited throughout the years. I am now 24 so it infuriates me a bit that I\u2019ve been afraid of vomiting my whole life. Well since I can remember. \n\nAnyone else with a trigger similar to mine. If so are there any tips you have. I try to calm myself when my thoughts are racing. Or I sometimes pace around. But I haven\u2019t found anything else that can help me ease my anxiety with this trigger. Oh I also do take medicine for my stomach ache such as a tums, pepto bismol, tea, ginger tablets, and other. Sometimes these help me in the moments but after a while if they aren\u2019t working my anxiety goes back up.",

What sucks is I have no one to talk to about this, I have 0 real friends, my family don't understand when I try talking to them about it like they brush it over and make my anxiety seem like no a big deal. It really sucks I've gained alot of weight in short stints feel like I'll be alone for life since I haven't had a meaningful relationship in years.\n\nI'm only 20 so I know I have time on my side but it just sucks when I can't join in a conversation because I have a habit of mumbling or I feel like I'm being judged by everything I say or do, I overthink literally everything and I feel like I simply can't be happy.\n\nAlso are there tips not to be so self conscious and to stop worrying what other people think about me? I really hate having that extra stress but it's inevitable right now for me.",

            "selftext": "Some background first; I am currently in the process of applying for Grad Schools in Speech Language Pathology. I am coming into this field with a degree in Theatre. I love performing and want to continue performing, but need a career that is stable enough to rely on. My day job is working as a nursing assistant and that's how I found Speech Pathology. I was attracted to it because it uses a lot of what I've learned in theatre (voice work, connecting/understanding people) and loved about nursing (caring for people, helping them get better, learning about who they are). \n\nI have bad anxiety, but have felt in the last few months like I was coping really well. I've been making sure I get plenty of sleep, exercise, have been eating healthy and have avoided caffeine and alcohol. I've been journaling and meditating when I can. I've never been good about that stuff, this is the longest stretch in my life of getting enough sleep each night. Yesterday though, I had a break down. \n\nI'm working on my cover letters and asked a friend who is in grad school for physics if I could read hers. It just made me so sad and defeated. She has such a passion for her field  and it shows with everything she's done. Dozens of conferences attended, she's lead several workshops at elementary schools in physics, has volunteered in multiple research labs and more.  It made me question everything I'm doing. I like speech pathology, but it's not my passion, like physics is her passion.  I don't go out of my way to volunteer more than I have too. Speech pathology is a very competitive field too and I just know I'm going to be up against a lot of girls who have resumes like my friends. But I feel like I don't know what the hell I'm going to do if I quit trying to apply to grad schools.\n\nI feel so lost, mediocre and just... I don't even know. I can't stop crying, my chest has hurt for the past 24 hours. There is so much I have to do right now too, like stuff that needs to get done **today** if I am going to keep going and that is just making it worse. It also just sucks because I've come so far already but now I just feel stuck in the mud.\n\nHas anyone ever felt like this? How did you get through? I feel like my life is falling apart",

I start thinking about all the things that have happened in my life but nothing fun or exciting it\u2019s always the traumatic things I\u2019ve experienced. The older I get the more often these things pop in my mind. Somethings I think about different things and sometimes I go weeks just thinking about the same experience over and over. \n\nLast night it was 2am and all I could replay in my head over and over was when I was a junior in high school I had a long term boyfriend. He lived with us most of my high school. He cheated and lied and abused me. Never any marks lucky for him, but over the years this one time always come back to me I think about it all the time. \n\nI was late for school my mom was leaving to take my siblings and I ask them boyfriend to take me at 2nd block so I could get finished. (He had dropped out already and had a license.) after my mom left he wanted me to have sex or give him a BJ in order for him to take me to school. I said no and we got in a huge argument. He started getting aggressive and I don\u2019t remember what happened in the room I just remember running out of the bedroom and to the front door to leave he grabbed me and shoved me onto the couch. I don\u2019t remember what was said after but I just remember him grabbing me by my throat and throwing me off the couch. I landed on my back trying to catch my breath since the wind was knocked out of me. (I\u2019m 5ft and he was 6\u20192\u201d) as I was laying there he just walked over and kicked me. \n\nI got up and was crying he started throwing a tantrum i was yelling for him to leave, my mom got home asked what was going on and I told her he was moving out. Well that just made things worse and he stormed out grabbing his things. My mom asked me what I did..... \n\nThe next thing I remember is him calling threatening me and me begging him to come back telling him I was sorry. \n\nI think about this all the time. How alone I felt all those years. How sad I was. So I lay at night thinking about the fact that I was 16 and now I\u2019m almost 30 still being able to feel his hands on my throat. That was just one morning of the 4 years I was treated this way under the same roof as my parents and siblings. \n\nMy mom liked him. She liked him more then she liked me. We are estranged now.\nMy dad was too drunk to care. \nI had no friends and I just wanted to be loved by anyone.",

I have panic attacks daily, I havent been to work this week due to being ill and probably won't be in work until atleast Monday. My anxiety has been so bad and I just don't feel like I can do this job, even though I've actually done it before. The scariest part for me is my girlfriend is relying on me with this job which just compounds the anxiety even further. I feel depressed and so anxious over this and I don't know what to do.

This started my bad mood but I was like okay he tried this is my problem. \n\nSo he goes to do other stuff and while he is away I randomly end up on this girls instapage (the girlfriend of one of his friends) that he has previously messaged several times trying to be funny and I saw he liked all her photos where she is wearing underwear or little clothes. She is ALOT pretterier than me, and he doesn\u2019t even know her. At this point I am fucking fuming because I feel so ugly, I know he likes her type of body. How can he do this to me, doesn\u2019t he think about how it makes me feel that he likes these pictures for everyone to see of his ideal body type?? \n\nWhen he comes back he notices something is wrong but I just cannot for the life of me tell him what is wrong because then I\u2019ll be the insecure crazy girlfriend, so I say nothing is wrong and it\u2019s quiet and weird and I\u2019m boiling on the inside. We go to the store and when we come back he asks if he can play ps4 with his friends and I say yes and go take a shower. \n\nAfter my shower I manage to push the glass soap dispenser off the sink and it of course breaks. He lives with his parents so now I freak out because I ruined something and he comes to clean it up as I\u2019m only in a towel. When I get back to the bedroom he has filled my waterbottle and put out cookies, muffins and a shot of some healthy vitamin stuff that I really like for me. \n\nSo now I feel really guilty for being angry and dissapointed in myself that I couldn\u2019t tell him and be a healthy partner just because of my anxiety. I also feel really sad and like I\u2019m not good enough. I have to stay up all night because I have an early appointment and it is 2 hours of sleep or no sleep so I chose no sleep. \n\nHow do I better manage/cope with my feelings? How can I let go of these feelings and not go crazy during the night? I want to be better but I am going crazy and I feel so fucking lonely in all this... I am begging for some help here D:",
