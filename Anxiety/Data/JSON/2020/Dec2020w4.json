I find myself constantly yawning to try and free this urge but it's impossible! \n\nThe only relief I have is sleeping and it does not interfere with my sleep and I don't even notice it even when I'm in bed I don't notice it either only when I'm wide awake do I feel it. \n\nI've gone to a handful of doctors and taken dozens of tests in my lungs and nothing has come up so they believe its anxiety. I've been going to a therapist for about 6 months now and I still have it, all the medications and suggestions they have given to me have not worked. I am losing hope that it even is anxiety but something like GERD or LPR.\n\nDoes anyone have any suggestions on how to cope with these symptoms? Thanks!",

            "selftext": "I haven't struggled with anxiety in a few months (which I'm very happy about) but I still get super anxious when I cook and it's fucking annoying, I'm sick of looking stupid because it takes a while to sort out what I have to do. \n\nWhenever I cook something, no matter how simple it is, I have to have everything sorted out, be sure that I know the exact order of the steps. I also have to make sure that I'm as efficient as possible because I feel very guilty if I use too many utensils, let alone break them. And things work out fine when I'm on my own and I can take my time preparing everything.\n\nBut if I'm with someone else and I'm rushed, I just kinda freeze until I have everything sorted out in my head. And I feel stupid doing it with someone around because all I can think about is how stupid I look being unable to follow some simple instructions. And then I get overwhelmed and my only option is asking the person exactly what I should do, which, again, makes me seem even more stupid. \n\nFor some context (why this is plaguing my mind), a few days ago my mom melted some chocolate in a bowl, and since she didn't use all of it for her recipe, she asked me if I wanted to use it to make some hot chocolate. Which would be simple enough: heat up the milk, pour it into the bowl to melt the chocolate, put it back in the pot. Except I just froze because I was too scared that the glass bowl would break from the heat, then got scared that the milk had stayed too long in the pot without being stirred and would then burn the pot, and i had to ask mom to guide me through all the steps so I could actually do it. It was fucking hot chocolate, why was it so difficult for me to do it. \n\nCan someone help me out with some advice?",

How bad is yours and what do you do to manage it?\u201d \nY\u2019all, I bawled like a baby.

She is now at a stage where she is unable to enjoy anything, and switches between two modes: completely unemotional (neutral to everything) or angry. Almost everything sets her off: kid not brushing his teeth or washing his hands correctly, me putting something in the wrong place, her mom calling at the wrong time. She is so distant I feel like I live with a very angry stranger who doesn't have any empathy for anyone else. It is very difficult, especially with a small child in the house.\n\nAny talk of therapy or even just talking to someone  immediately results in fury, uncontrollable crying, and shutting down. \"I never want to talk. I'm fine. I'm upset now only because you want to talk.\" Etc.\n\nNo suicidal thoughts or direct self-harm, but she is massively self-destructive. Pushes the few friends we have left away, same with family. Gives up on exercise. Weight gain, compulsive eating, then beating herself up for eating, endless cycle.\n\nDoctor told me he can't do anything unless she is willing to enter therapy or other treatment. She is \"close to a mental health crisis\" but \"too strong willed\" to have a breakdown which puts her in limbo where the health care system is concerned.\n\nI realized this morning i actually dread waking up because it means dealing with the anger and distance caused by whatever happens during the day. And we're just entering two weeks of covid Christmas. Which she wants to cancel because \"presents are stupid and a waste of time.\"\n\nShe used to be such a loving and warm person. Now she is a shell of anxiety and depression and anger, and i have no idea what to do.",

I remember being very talented due to my belief in myself. I remember being able to recall names, words and past events instantly without forgetting them and living without brain fog. The more time passes the more I feel like I'm missing out living life in a normal manner. I know what it feels like to be normal, I envy everybody else who doesn't have to go through this. Whenever people get worried about everyday things I feel like these are just small problems I wish I had. I can remember being normal perfectly and know that it is a real thing, but I can't go back no matter how hard I try. Ever since moving to another country and being diagnosed with hypothyroidism my life has been a constant fight and it's been more than 13 years. My day is all about spending most of my energy trying to memorize things, pretending to understand stuff while I'm struggling to concentrate, focussing on not looking stupid. I have very intense depersonalization/derealization, feel tired all the time and have an empty stare. Due to my lack of decision-making I chose the wrong career and studied 8 years, now being unhappy with where I am heading to. I wasted all of my attention and energy on something I don't like, disregarding everything else. I feel like a child who hasn't learned the essential things that really matter in life yet.\nI don't know what to do anymore, Reddit. I feel like this constant chat with random people on the internet has been everything I ever did, my life. I have a nice family, have had a few cool experiences in my life, but was never able to fully enjoy it due to my anxiety and it's making me hopeless I will ever feel happy again. I can't love myself because there's nothing I can be proud of besides of the fake persona I have become. I don't know what to do anymore.",

I have recently come to understand that my speech impediment is most likely caused by my anxiety.\n\nI was ridiculed by family, peers, teachers, coaches, etc growing up for my lack of clear speech. I was quiet because I had bad volume control/awareness (mostly an ADHD thing), I couldn't and still struggle to articulate my words and stutter to this day.\n\nBecause of this constant nagging growing up, I realized I totally shut down. I thought I was just a shy kid who didn't talk a lot, but I realize now I wasn't talking because I was afraid to. I even notice now, how at 21 years old, I restrict my speech to the bare minimum. If I don't know exactly what I want to say and how to say it without a stutter or pause, I won't say anything. This makes me seem sort of rude sometimes when I can't respond to simple questions like 'what's your favourite colour' in a fully fleshed out manner. Unless I'm with the friends who I feel totally comfortable with (maybe 2 people), I just can't get the words out.\n\nI guess I'm just wondering how I get over this? I'm getting better, I've tried talking to more friends one on one, practicing my speech and to professors. But the second someone tells me to speak up, be more clear or laughs at my stutter, I shut down. I completely regress back to that scared little kid and I don't know how to break the cycle. I'm trying so hard and love my friends so much for helping me. \n\nIf anyone has any advice I would appreciate it with my whole being. I just want to be able to be the person I know I am deep down.",

I referred myself for help in October and after an assessment I got referred to some other people who won't contact me until the start of January, which isn't long now I know but I'm sick of waiting. And explaining the same things over and over.\nI just feel so fucked up lately I'm tired of it. I'm tired of worrying and I'm tired of thinking.

They have been married for 20+ years and I am quite shocked to find out about this. Other people told me i should not be affected about these kinds of things, but i just want to help my dad overcome jealousy. I want my family to be happy.\n\nSo, a few months ago my grandmother passed away. A few days after that, the wife of one of our neighbors passed away too. Since then, my mom and my neightbor(mom-49, neighbor-over 55) have talked a little, mostly about funeral organization and stuff like that. Now, my mom is very religious and I dont think she would cheat on my dad. But my dad is obsessed with this and he got drunk 2 times this month because of it (which he mostly never does). He even found a way to record my mom and found that she said to someone: \"we'll go for a walk tonight\" (she was referring tk the neighbor). My dad also saw them one day walking together. \n\nNow, my mom doesnt have barely any friends, and i dont think that she likes the neighbor romantically, but how do i convince my dad of that? My dad is not very masculine (he is not the dominant one in the house) and i want to help him. I want to explain to him that jealousy is not healthy and he should be more masculine and continue to court my mom (my dad almost never takes my mom out if she doesnt suggest it). I hope nothing bad will happen and everything will come back to normal.\n\nHas anyone been in this situation? Can you help me with some advice?\n\nThank you a lot!",

            "selftext": "(Throwaway account - also intentionally vague, I would be happy to explain in DMs to whoever is interested!) I got into a fight in college (which was provoked, but I ended up getting heat for reacting to the provocation) and the person involved made a huge Twitter thread about it a few months ago, saying I was a white supremacist. They included my full name and I received dozens of messages about how awful I am, how I'm racist, how I should be afraid. I didn't respond or anything - just hid. A lot of it was completely false and misleading - I told my boss about it and he was very supportive, so my life wasn't completely ruined. All of my friends tell me to just move on, it doesn't matter, but the thought of people thinking I'm racist or irrational or anything negative makes my heart hurt so much.\n\nI live every day in fear, I always think about it. Mostly about my reputation - I definitely think the other person was acting in malice, but my anxiety tells me that they know me better than I do. I ended up cutting ties with my therapist because after a year, she laughed at me about the situation and told me I couldn't move past the situation because I wasn't willing to consider that I was wrong to be defensive of myself. I just want to figure out a way to stop caring. This happened over two years ago. Any advice?",

My parents are quite supportive although I know they are struggling and get frustrated easily sometimes shouting which has created fears added onto myself and my siblings that If and when they get angry it makes the situation very hard to deal with. My sister also is struggling to deal with it not feeling she can trust anyone to stay calm with her as she talks about it.

            "selftext": "I have been going through some debilitating anxiety lately and 3 weeks ago I started on Celexa 20mg. A week ago I went up from 20mg to 40mg and I haven\u2019t noticed any improvement in my anxiety from the start so far. Did anyone here not get better in the first couple weeks but got better after more time? I am really worried that it\u2019s not going to be working for me and my doctor told me this is pretty much my only option and the best thing to try for anxiety treatment the only other thing would be trying a different SSRI",
