I ram into the back of some soccer mom or redneck truck driver (sometimes it's a complete wreck and total of both cars) who then proceed to yell at me, say I wasn't paying attention or texting and driving because I'm a dumb teenager and that's just what teenagers do.\n\n Then come home to find someone took a video of me \"not paying attention\" and they upload it to r/idiotsincars and I'm the laughing stock of my neighborhood and my family is put into massive financial debt because of 'my' fuck up.\n\nI s\\*\\*t you not, this nightmare happens all the time and I'm terrified to drive in real life because of it. It's not like it's a justified fear either, I've never even checked my phone for the time while driving, let alone text someone. (and never will.) I've never put anyone I've driven with in any danger\n\n I went and talked to a therapist about it for a while and my confidence built a little, but then my mom got cancer a couple days later and then there was encouragement to drive her 2 hours both ways to the hospital for doctors appointments. Completely shattered what little confidence I had and I can't even drive around the block without getting shivers anymore.\n\nI don't expect to get any advice that'll make me feel better or make the nightmares stop, just wanted to get it off my chest and vent.  \n(Also my doctor gave me a low dose prescription of Ativan to relax, didn't help, still shivered like a little b\\*\\*\\*\\*.)",

            "selftext": "Hi everyone, \n\nI've been taking propranolol 20mg as needed for the past year or so and benzos as well though I am very cautious with those. My anxiety is more physical than emotional and so propranolol has been great at helping with my most challenging symptom of heart pounding and unease in the chest when nervous/anxious. I'm going through a bit of a high-pressure moment career/studies wise so I was okay'ed to take 20mg two-three times a day as a consistent prescription rather than as needed only. \n\nNow, my question is: has anyone had experience with taking propranolol daily? If so, how was it? A more important question though is whether anyone has the experience of taking it daily backfiring and anxiety actually increased over time like it does with benzo use? I am experiencing more unease and heart flutters and am not sure if it is due to the propranolol or that I am a bit more stressed at the moment. \n\nThank you!",

            "selftext": "It is my (17F) second semester of senior year. I go to a smaller, private, college-prep Christian school. I took a leave from school in 2018 due to mental health issues, then returned to the same school. Last semester, I missed the last two weeks due to anxiety and health issues. Second semester just started and I missed the first two days because of anxiety. Anxious because I am disconnected from the people at my school and because I disappeared at the end of last semester. Also anxious of judgment due to very judgmental and not understanding people at my school. I am super anxious about going since I have been gone so long. We are making a list of possible 504 plan accommodations that would help my success in school with my guidance counselor. Possibly spending the period of a stressful class in the guidance counselor\u2019s office. What are some ideas of accommodations to include? \n\nThe days I\u2019ve spent at home I\u2019ve done nothing. I haven\u2019t talked to anyone or worked on schoolwork which makes my anxiety worse. I also have depression so I do not get pleasure from anything and it is hard for me to do anything. I am not close anymore with the people at my school, but I wish I could hangout with some outside of class as that would be the most helpful in lessening my anxiety about school. There are some very nice acquaintances I could reach out to, but I don\u2019t know how to suggest hanging out. My mom suggested I express my fear of judgment with them, because they likely know the feeling but I do not know how. I know the more school I miss, the worse it gets, but what will help me get to school tomorrow?",

            "selftext": "Hi, I\u2019ve been suffering from ocd for nearly 8 years. Last year, my ocd aggravated owing to something and I believe, I was half insane during that period. During that stressful period, I spent most of my days doing compulsions for nearly a month. Following that stressful period, my ocd had worsened and the impact was extremely severe(lasting till now). \n\nI would like to talk about one incident which has scarred me and scared me for life. In April, while studying for my finals, a thought suddenly popped up from the ocd stating what if I constantly bombard your mind with images and distract you. This immediately induced panic  and I started worrying that my life is screwed and that I\u2019m going to end up in a psychiatric ward forever. That being said, this only lasted few days but the impact was extremely intense . For some time , when I was trying to study or even take a dump, I would have intrusive thoughts. It would randomly bring thoughts about god or other thoughts with the aim of distracting me. \n\nNow , this didn\u2019t exactly last long but the fear of it has lingered. Since April, it has kept scaring me by saying I will bombard your mind and this thought has constantly aroused fear and led to me performing a repetitive compulsion of rationalization.i had also started counseling and I learnt that the problem is the compulsions. So, eventually I weaned off it over a long period of time and infact, since 2 months, I\u2019ve been doing good wrt my mental health(it still bothers me, but, at a minimal level). I should also say I\u2019m on 80 mg Prozac and 1 mg Ativan. \n\nBasically, when I have to do any activitiy whether it\u2019s driving, or even something as mundane as brushing, it immediately tries to say-\u201coh, I will distract you now\u201d and it has been doing this for exams and speeches too. Granted, the intrusive thoughts don\u2019t really come like before they come although it induces anxiety and it can effect my mood. I know it is extremely stupid too albeit many times when I have to do an activity, it tries to distract me and the fear of being distracted is too overwhelming and it capitalizes upon that fear. It tries to induce a fear of dropping out, because I can\u2019t study and it capitalizes on that by saying, I won\u2019t let you study.\n\nWhat is your advice for this, and , please please help me. And yes, I do go for counseling and do visit a psychiatrist.",

            "selftext": "Im terrified of school, the social interactions. I dont want to go back to school, last time I was there, I delivered anonymous holiday cards that said nice things about people, too nice things, and people made fun. I didnt even make it through the day, I left in the middle of it. Then I didnt go to school for the rest of the week, then was christmas break and now im still sitting at home, recovering from the flu. I dont want to go back and be alone again. What if they found out I wrote those cards? It would be emberassing. Wish I didnt write them. I hate how I sometimes do these things. I think that theyre going to be just some nice, kind thing for them, but they dont even care. Its just my alone and lonely and sad and anxious and introverted brain talking. People dont care. Theyre being nice out of manners. God I dont want to go back and face the anxiety, I'd rather stay home and be dumb like I already am. I hate this. I hate living.\nIt doesnt help that I have a boyfriend who I have never met. We met through a video game, knew eacher for a couple of months, he said he liked me, we started dating (now its 3 months that we are). Sure, we video call, but rarely. Mostly we play together every day. He knows I have social anxiety, but he doesnt know much more. I havent been diagnosed with anything else, but I dont feel right. Im not gonna say I have anything else unless diagnosed, but boy.. I feel like a depressed little bitch.\nThat doesnt matter though. Not what I wanna vent about. What I want to vent about is the anxiety im getting from this relationship. Im scared. Im so scared. We'll probably be able to meet in the summer, when he'd visit me. But I dont know how to feel. I'm scared that I'd fail him, that I'd dissapoint him. I dont think i'd be able to talk much, I'd be so anxious and I'd take me so long to get comfortable, that he'd already have to leave and it'd be a waste. But what would someone do when you wait 9 months to meet someone and you end up not liking them in person or it just doesnt click, or it just feels wrong? Normally, wouldnt you break up with them? I'm just scared that he'd stay with me because of that time. What doesnt help is that I've been getting thought of just shutting him out of my life, of leaving. Hes a wonderful guy, but I'm not sure I like his 'rude' side personality. He makes rude jokes, and im fine with them on a small basis, but when theyre all his jokes, its a bit too much. Doesnt help how he only says bad things (about thr game) when we're playing. He has such a nice side though and those rude things are jokes and he doesnt care about the game (if he loses or wins) (as he says atleast), but it doesnt seem that way tbh. Seems likr hes genuenly frustrated and it sucks to play with that. Especially when he bm's people for fun. I've been on the other side of those people he bm's and its not good. But now I cant even help those ppl feel better, because then im not supporting my bf, and he doesnt like it when im not on his side and I mean, who wouldnt want their partner on their side, but I really dont like how inconsiderate to others feelings he is. Sure, its in a game, but there are fragile people there. I was one of them once. Sometimes, I still am. But now atleast im confident enough to not care. Still hate myself though not as much.\nIf you want to answer or know, understand more- im 16 and its my first relationship. I was deadshit terrified at the very start, especially since I didnt know how i'd work, but for some reason I was afraid to ask.

I hate anyone coming round. I hate my house, I am embarrassed by it and everything in it. My mum offered to come in and be with me but it's likely I will go hide in my bedroom, something I can't do when they are there.\n\nThey said they would move furniture and take down curtains and stuff but I'm dreading what they will think of my house.

            "selftext": "First... I apologize for the long-winded post.\n\nLike many others, everything happening in the world has thrown my anxiety into a tailspin. I open r/WorldNews and see thread after thread about either the Iran-US situation or Australian wildfire. I go on Facebook and see posts about Australia, or WWIII/Draft memes. I\u2019d had this feeling of dread and lots of anxiety. I\u2019ve been afraid about what could come - what if WWIII actually does happen, what if it escalates to nuclear war? What if we get plunged back into the dark ages? I\u2019ve been so afraid that Trump is going to press the button or do something really bad.\n\nThis subreddit has really helped relieve my anxiety. It\u2019s helpful knowing I\u2019m not crazy or alone. Reading through this subreddit has made me realize that maybe I\u2019m overreacting, and I shouldn\u2019t be as anxious as I am.\n\nI was diagnosed with anxiety/depression about 6 or 7 years ago when I was about 13 years old. Ironically, I was diagnosed after having a constant fear that the world was about to end and we were going to be in a nuclear war. Those fears were primarily propagated by religion - so for a few years now I\u2019ve been non-religious. (Despite my family\u2019s criticism - they\u2019re deeply religious.)\n\nI was on medication and seeing a psychiatrist (and a licensed counselor) for a few years until I lost my health insurance a couple years ago. Ever since, I haven\u2019t been able to see a psychiatrist or receive my medication because I can\u2019t afford it. I\u2019ve been on my own since, talking to counselors provided through my university.\n\nI\u2019ve been through a lot. I was feeling optimistic that 2020 would be my year and things would give my anxiety/depression a break. But I had my doubts, because it seems like the last few years have been getting worse by the year.\n\nIn 2017, my grandmother was diagnosed with stage 4 cancer and my dog passed away. In 2018, within a two-day span my grandmother passed away and my parents separated (after being married for 40 years, they split on my birthday.) There was some fallout between me and my mother (who had severe mental health issues) after the split, but I\u2019m thankful to say that we were able to reconcile.\n\n2019 was by far the worst year of my life. Things were going smooth until April, when I found out my mentor would be leaving. The next Monday, I received word that my mother had unexpectedly passed away. Immediately following that was the extremely traumatic and horrible fallout that followed with her family, who has essentially be enemies with my family. Two of her family members blamed me and my father for her \u201cbad life\u201d, said we \u201cabused\u201d her and then proceeded to threaten me and my father\u2019s lives. In May most of my friends graduated. When I returned in August I found out I no longer had a job, which forced me to scramble to find a new job. At that same time my counselor dropped me, so I\u2019ve been seeing a free counselor provided by my university that isn\u2019t as good since. And in October I had to go the ER, where I fell $2,100 in debt to the local hospital. I can barely live on my wages after paying the hospital.\n\nI was hoping 2020 would be better but so far it\u2019s not looking it. Politics and this conflict have surged my anxiety. I\u2019m a liberal, non-religious person who lives (and grew up) in the Midwest in a deep-red state. My entire (extended) family is super-conservative and very religious. Many of my friends are conservative. (My high school held a mock election in 2016 and Trump won like 80-85% of the student body.) I want de-escalation and don\u2019t want war. I don\u2019t want to see innocent people (on both sides) die for nothing. But many of the people around here want war. Ever since the bombing I\u2019ve seen more Trump flags and \u201cTrump trucks\u201d than I have since the election finished. I do not like Trump and constantly live in fear of what he may do next.\n\nI\u2019ve been really trying to focus on my mental health (and my health in general.)\n\nI\u2019ve been trying to do things that I enjoy to take my attention off everything. I\u2019ve been watching positive TV shows and trying to play positive, non-violent video games. I\u2019ve been focusing on continuing to build my Minecraft world and have started playing Stardew Valley, both of which are pretty relaxing. I\u2019ve been riding my bike, setting new goals each day and trying to push myself to go further each day. I\u2019ve tried to think positively in general and think about a great future.\n\nI hope some day I can get back on my feet financially and be able to afford professional mental health. I\u2019ve wanted to see a licensed counselor rather than my current one, which never provides feedback but just listens to me and jots down notes. I hope to some day get back on my medication that helped reduce my anxiety/depression, and maybe even get an emotional support animal to help. I can\u2019t afford it now (especially with the whole hospital situation) but I hope some day in the (hopefully) near future I can.\n\nI just wanted to introduce myself. This subreddit has been very helpful in controlling my anxiety, and I wanted to say thanks.",

            "selftext": "       So I\u2019ve posted on this subreddit before about how I have night anxiety. A few months ago, I went on a new medication that really helped up until a little while ago. I\u2019m basically having anxiety for no reason at night that can result in crying or panic attacks. I\u2019m not worried about anything, in fact, I could be having a great day until my body decides I\u2019m not. The only thing that helps is going to bed at 7:00 or earlier before the sun sets. \n       I haven\u2019t been able to get ahold of my psychiatrist because he got surgery and is on break. His nurse has been raising another one of my meds that she feels more comfortable raising without him. Although it helps a little, I still can\u2019t stand staying up past 7 or 8. I\u2019ve been trying to get them to raise the one medication that actually took it away completely. Today they told me that they wanted me to try \u201cfighting through\u201d the anxiety and seeing how late I can stay up before I can\u2019t take it.\n       Are you kidding me? I don\u2019t think they realize the severity of my problem. I think they want to see if raising that one medication is really necessary or if I really need it. \n       So basically I need to cry or have a panic attack tonight for them to believe me? I don\u2019t know. Tonight is not going to be a good night.",
