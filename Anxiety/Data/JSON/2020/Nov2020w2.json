I havnt been myself since this started. It coincidentally and sadly started right after we had our first child. I have looked into post-partum stuff but I am a male so idk if it applies or not. Anyway, I've just been told I have severe anxiety and not OCD. Has anyone else gone though this? Did it get better? What helped? Thanks for your time",

            "selftext": "This is gonna be a longish post. \n\nI have been an anxious person my whole life but in this pandemic my mental health took a nose dive and left me stranded. In March Covid cases in my country rose up significantly and so did my anxiety. I was running and working out every day and meditating daily as well. But as my anxiety rose, I stopped doing these activites and couldnt sleep very well. In June I had a panic attack which made things even worse. I had very high heart rate and severe palpitations and thought I was gonna die.\n\nI was in a deep dark hole. My parents were angry with me because of my anxiety and this made me even more anxious. I struggled A LOT. One thing that pulled me out of this hole was MEDITATION. Every day I was worried about having another panic attack. Those two weeks were hell. I would get these surges in my brain and I'd stop doing everything,close my eyes and start focusing on my breath. \n\nSlowly things improved. I started studying again. I had to get off the drugs cause they made my totally no functional during the day. So I got off of propranolol slowly while carefully handling my fragile mental state. I still had to take xanax and getting off of it was much more difficult. It took me two weeks to start the weaning off process and I quit taking it last week.\n\nThese 6 months have taught me two things. \n\nFirst, I am not as mentally weak and fragile as I think and secondly no matter what happens, I am gonna deal with it head on. In the end things turn out to be okay. I am pretty proud of myself for getting out of that deep dark hole where every day was a battle with my own mind and thoughts. I have started C25K again today and gonna graduate this time.\n\nOne thing that helped me in all this is MEDITATION. It made me able to see into my own mind and thoughts and realize how anxious I was in the subconcious. \n\n\nThose of you who are struggling, Dont give up. Do whatever it takes to pull yourself out of that hole. Things will get better I promise you. If I can do it then you can do it too. Stay Strong!",

I\u2019m also kind of scared to take medication however my GP just prescribed me trazadone to help me sleep/be less anxious. Has anyone tried out trazadone and if so has it helped? \n\nI\u2019m gonna try to find a therapist soon but for now I\u2019m debating whether or not I should actually take the meds. \n\nThanks!",

I think I\u2019m having a mixed manic/depressive episode, but it could be a panic attack? I\u2019ve had both, and I know what triggered it. I\u2019m competing in a zoom tournament for competitive public speaking and acting from home right now. I have a piece I perform that unfortunately makes me relive some trauma, but I perform really well with it. In this very huge tournament, I made it to the semifinal. I gave my all into that round, and I didn\u2019t make it to the final. I got really upset about it because I poured my heart into the round and didn\u2019t make it. But I found this out right before I had to perform for another semifinal round, and it made me get really nervous and mess up in the round. \n\nThat was a lot, and obviously I take too much stock in what people think of me, but goddamnit I work so hard. So so hard. And my team has shown a history of only caring about me when I make final rounds. So it kind of sent me into a downward spiral (I was already on adderall today too), and now I can\u2019t stop frantically breathing and crying. Maybe it\u2019s just a panic attack? Dangerous thoughts are coming in my head though. I know this is stupid, something so seemingly small triggered this, but I really don\u2019t feel okay right now. \n\nI don\u2019t know, but I have another semifinal to perform for, so I really need to calm down before my next round. Please let me know any tips or tricks you may have to help me out.",

            "selftext": "Reposting this here as well, in hopes to get as many answers and help as possible:\n\nHi everyone, I am feeling lost, and I really, really don't know what to do.\n\nI don't think that anybody will have a miracle solution for me, but I really need to vent, because I am constantly on the verge of crying...\n\nIn my country, we are forced into mandatory service for about 3 years. I was recruited, obviously, against my choice, and worked in an office job due to asthma and various problems. I basically did the dirty work for officers at higher ranks than me, arranged schedules, summed up things and made coffee, a secretary. I feel like I've \"Wasted\" 3 years of my life doing practically nothing, but that's okay, I felt more than overjoyed when it was over, and always dreamt about how I'd pursue my dream career and fulfill my dream, living as a free man and working at a moderate job that I'd be happy with. It's been a year since I've finished my service, and during the first months, I couldn't ever be more overjoyed. I soon after started taking something called a \"Psychometric Exam\" (Which are pretty much the local SATs, only that they are taken way more into consideration here when enrolling to University more than anything for some reason) and paid for it with the grand the army gave me. I worked part time as a teacher assistant at school and things were quite stressful but okay. Covid stroke mid-way through my course, delaying it from 3 months to 6, but at the end of things, I aced this exam and enrolled onto quite a good University at a Computer Science major. Ever since I was a child, I grew up with a Gameboy Color and a copy of Pokemon Silver in hand. I was infatuated with this small machine, and told myself that I want to make things just like this when I grow up, I decided that my dream was making videogames, and that this is the career that I want to pursue. Although, as I grew older, I found out that I am also fascinated with just creating my own projects in generals, I think I'd be pretty happy making apps, games or websites. When I was 12, I began pursuing my dream and learnt art and animation out of all, and I was horrible at it at first, but now I think I make some quite decent graphic design and animation in 2D with Adobe Flash CS/Animation CC. Even though I had the art and visual aspects of a game, I never had the programming talents. But I decided that once I'd start my degree, I'd get hang of it and be able to profess and maybe even mix both of my loves for art and creation. About 3 weeks ago, I have started my Computer Science degree. A degree I've pursued for a while, and was sure that I was on the right path in life. Yet my whole world fell apart quite quickly. I don't do well at all under pressure, and maybe it was very naive of me, and please, don't judge me harshly there, I am already super hard on myself, but I simply collapsed. I was never the top of my class when it comes down to mathematics, I was pretty average. Yet, I just couldn't comprehend that this is the level of math required for this degree. I was overwhelmed, I barely Understood a thing, and 90% of my classes were mathematics. I found myself studying it all day, every day, at home from my small room with my PC 8 AM until 6 PM, then overflooded with assignments every day from 6 PM until 10 to 11 PM, yet I \\*still\\* couldn't keep up with the pace. I barely made it in time for my assignments, I barely understood my professors, and more than anything, I felt lost and anxious. My body reacted badly, very, very badly. I felt the constant need to vomit, I was crying all the damn time, my heartbeat was rising out of the blue like mad, I had headaches, I felt fatigued all the time, I couldn't eat a thing, and I even couldn't sleep. I remember the last week fondly in that regard, where I actually had to wait for the professor to upload the next assignment, it was the first night in two weeks where I had \"no assignments\" at all whatsoever until the next one was uploaded, yet I was so tired, it was 7 PM and I've just finished school, so I decided to go to sleep. Yet all that ran through my mind was formulas that didn't even exist, I felt insane. I tried so hard not to think about a thing, I just wanted to sleep, yet I woke up every 15 minutes, during the whole night, I waited in tears to tell my mom that I just couldn't sleep at all that night. And I felt myself collapsing. I saw a doctor, which offered me pills and a psychiatrist, but I've turned the offer down, not wanting to take chemical pills on a regular basis, I went for a natural remedy, which did basically nothing, if anything, it made me feel even more fatigued. I talked to my friends, to my family, to people who had completed this degree and people who were one year above me, looking for answers, for a tiny peak of hope. The people who did it told me that if anything, things gets worse, you get even less free time, and you get even more courses, and the courses obviously, too, get harder. I felt myself suffocating until I couldn't handle it anymore, and last Friday, I quit. I didn't feel relieved until a few days ago, but now the anxiety had replaced itself with depression. Suddenly, the whole world seems gloom, gray-scaled. I can't find any passion that I want to pursue, I can't even focus on my hobbies anymore. I've been told by friends that I absolutely dont need a degree in this field, yet that it would certainly help. But I am dreadful, I at first thought that maybe this profession ain't for me after all, and to be frank, I still ain't so sure. But earlier this week, I took some courses on uDemy, learning some different things rather than the abstract mathematics and C langauge they've told us in this brief while that I already collapsed during. I found Javascript and Python quite enjoyable, but of course, I am just a beginner, so it might not reflect anything, but I do enjoy this front-end course I am taking. Yet, I am filled with dread and confusion, I don't know which path to take, everything seems so big and scary, I am afraid of finding out that I won't even like computer science, because I absolutely have no other passion, I am afraid of not having a degree, that no employer will look at me seriously, or heck, that I might even find myself 5-10 years into the future at some lousy job/fired and then stuck with no degree in my late 20s/30s. I thought about maybe taking night courses that are spread across 3 semesters instead of 2 a year in college instead, which means a less prestigious degree, and also nobody promised me that it'll solve the problem and make things easier on me. I just wanna calm down, I wanna know that things will be okay, but everything is so scary and depressing all of the sudden. I still cry a lot, and now I am also in debt to the University, demanding 40% of the first year's payment because I quit, which is ridiculous. I come from a poor family, and I really want to break the cycle, but for the first time in my life, ironically, just now, when I tried to, I feel poorer than ever. I actually feel what it's like not having money. Courses are expensive, so is University and College. I don't know what to do...",

It's ruining my relationships and my motivation to study (I'm in college).\n\nHow do you guys cope? What can I do ? I can't see a therapist because I'm not financially independent so that's not an option. Does meditation really work? Because I don't think so. Help me",

            "selftext": "For as long as I can remember I\u2019ve also had anxiety, specifically social anxiety. Growing up I was deadly afraid of speaking in front of others, ordering food, talking over the phone. Luckily as an adult I have moved pass those anxieties, now that I\u2019m college student my anxiety is often triggered by deadlines, poor grades, and asking for help. I\u2019m an Art major, so there are many moments were the attention is on me and big expectations to produce quality work, so often these are triggers for me. I can\u2019t help to care so much about my work and it often leads to me missing deadlines, and I know it makes me look like I\u2019m lazy and that I don\u2019t care because I\u2019ve been told so from other students. The fact is, I\u2019ve had many sleepless nights, days of not showering, days of not eating because I\u2019m so dedicated to my work. Being at home during the pandemic I\u2019ve slipped back into my depressive comfort of my room, specifically my bed and because of that I have no motivation to do my work until the last minute and then I hate myself for doing such rushed-poor work. It is all a cycle that I experience daily. On top of this my anxiety has caused me to be ultra-aware of body, and often times when I may have leg pain, indigestion, itching throat, body aches, I rush to my mother and tell her how I may have cancer or COVID-19. I know she gets annoyed by this and like many mothers, she tells me \u201cdon\u2019t worry\u201d, etc. and lately it\u2019s gotten me frustrated because it seems like she doesn\u2019t take my concerns seriously. For example, today I receive a ring in the mail and I tried it on and of course it got stuck. I panicked and begun crying and become hysterical as the ring wouldn\u2019t budge. My mom suggested using soap and water remove it and it worked, but like she does, she told me not to worry and that it\u2019s fine, and it made me snap. I yelled at her and begun punching my leg and skull. I do this to calm myself, as my anxiety and anger become so overwhelming. I\u2019m not quite sure why I do self harm, but I think it may be because when I was younger I would throw phones, plates, food, remotes out of frustration. My mom would then yell at me and tell me not to do it, so now I hit myself. I do think about suicide and how my mothers life would be better if I wasn\u2019t in it. I often blame myself for everything and I tell myself how unimportant I am because I\u2019m such a failure. I\u2019ve told my mother about my anxiety/anger/depression and it often leads to more fighting afterwords. She has told how I need to go to a hospital and that I\u2019m crazy, but those statements only make me hate myself more. I do want to get help, but I\u2019m afraid of being honest and opening up. I\u2019m trying to figure how I can cope with my issues at home.",

It doesn't help that our training was essentially useless and didn't even include a walk through of the actual phone program, so I don't even know how to call the mentor line for help. All we have for help right now is a Skype chat room which is constantly bloated with a dozen different people simultaneously flipping out with two trainers to help us all. I have spent almost every moment since I clocked out on Friday on the verge of tears, just dreading Monday morning. The feeling of having someone on hold, knowing I have no clue how to help them and the trainer might be busy with someone else, especially when half the callers are mean as shit and extremely impatient right off the bat, is enough to make me want to scream.

We fuck up so that we can pass that knowledge on and possibly help the next person. All we have is a shitty \"road map\". Slight guidelines we've picked up from rom-com's and Disney movies. You grow up, you find a fantastic job without any issue, you just happen to run into the person thats \"meant\" for you. You buy a house, get married and fall deeply in love, pop out a few kids and Ta Da! you did it. \n\nWe all know its bullshit. And it is so comforting for me to think about how we're all just trying to figure it out. Trying to figure out how to be happy. No one truly know how to do it. And no one ever will. So we just have to help each other. To find out own personal versions of happiness.The ultimate goal in a world where it's near impossible to keep a straight and narrow path. \n\nThis was on my brain and I felt I should share. As a person who deals with anxiety and depression, I found this thought to be very refreshing. It helped me and made it a little easier for me to breathe. I hope it helps you too.",

I don\u2019t want to stand, shower, brush my teeth, anything. I quit my job because I thought it to be unfair to just call in sick every day because I can\u2019t even go outside without freaking out. I feel like I\u2019m dying every second of the day, and I\u2019ve been self harming after a year clean from it. I feel hopeless.\n\nI have an appointment for my doctor on the 16th, but that\u2019s just too far away for me to continue living like this. I\u2019m on propranolol to help with my anxiety, but no matter how much I take, it doesn\u2019t take away my anxiety, which freaks me out more. I have not been able to eat in three entire days and it\u2019s been freaking me out. Every time I go to eat I feel sick, and I genuinely don\u2019t want to eat. I\u2019ve dealt with anorexia in my past, but thought I was doing a lot better lately. I\u2019m so skinny and weak, always dizzy, feel numb, and can barely talk to anyone about anything. It\u2019s too much for me to take.\n\nHas anyone experienced anything similar to this? How did you go through it? Im so hopeless. Thank you.",

Im struggling to eat because when my anxiety gets extremely high I usually throw up. This is as you would guess make my anxiety even worse.  I'm on vacation trying to enjoy myself but when thoughts are constant about my next meal and if I'll be able to eat it are making it very difficult to enjoy this time. I'm scared that this trouble eating will stick around for some time and I'm stuck in this looping thought process. I could really use some advice, I'm at a loss.",
