            "selftext": "My sister is a prime example of someone that never worries, dont get me wrong I've seen her worry but never to a point of obsession. Recently she got a letter from the IRS saying that she filed her taxes wrong and she was overpaid. She had to set up a phone meeting with someone  to discuss it. She was more annoyed than worried, and after she read the letter she went out with her friends for dinner and was fine. If that had been me I would have obsessed and been so consumed with the entire thing. I started googling things and read horror stories about the IRS taking people's wages etc. I was worried for her.  But she just went on with life, when I asked her if she was scared she said \"Scared for what shit like this happens all the time I'm not the first person who's done it\". Long story short she spoke with someone from the IRS she set up a payment plan and will be paying them back, no big deal. \n\nI've always been amazed at how she can just brush things off like that and just go on with life. Granted she can be a bit careless at times and has done some risky things  but sometimes I wish I was like that. \n\nHave you ever been in awe by someone's ability to just not worry about things? lol",

I never went as a kid(too poor) and I went for the first time when I was 18 and it wasn\u2019t a good experience at all. The doctor was really mean to me, so I always put off going and only go for emergencies (2 times since in the last 10 years). I wanted to change this and do better and go. I worked up the courage to go if my husband would come with me and stay with me and help answer questions so I didn\u2019t start having a panic attack. I get way too overwhelmed. The morning of the appointment (today) I had two panic attacks and my husband was the cause of one. He didn\u2019t mean to be, but I showed him something with my teeth and he made a disgusted face and it sent me spiraling. I still decided to go forward with the appointment, my husband said he would do all the talking and stay with me. He told me he told them I need to be with him during my appointment. Immediately upon getting there, They separated us and I had to do the appointment alone. I tried really hard to hold it together for like 25 minutes. I got through the scans and a million questions but eventually I started having a panic attack. My husband showed back up then but did not comfort me. Everyone kept asking me questions and my husband wouldn\u2019t answer for me even though I was not able to speak. Eventually another dentist came in and was trying to talk to me again and I couldn\u2019t do it. I said I had to leave and asked my husband for the keys and went to the car. I cried in front of 10 people (I do not cry in front of other people) and was in hysterics. My husband got the information from dentist after I left. I am so upset with my husband and I feel like he let me down in a profound way. I don\u2019t know what to do. The dentist wrote me a prescription for Valium if I will come back but I don\u2019t think I will be able to go back now. I feel even more embarrassed and traumatized about the dentist then before. I have also now lost all faith in my husband to be supportive with this in the future.\n\nI don\u2019t know what to do about my husband or myself.",

I\u2019ve recently gotten into journaling my anxiety experience and wanted a separate place to do so. \n\nQuick background: Anxiety and what appears to be a panic disorder began for me roughly five years ago. I had a difficult five or six months coming to an understanding of it which then led to a respite lasting a few years. More recently over the past year, I\u2019ve experienced a resurgence. The frequency and length of episodes has increased. In a sense I can blame covid for making life full of stressors, but my anxiety doesn\u2019t feel like it stems from social/pandemic reasons. In short, it feels like obsessive thoughts about falling back into a place where I thought I had overcome. \n\nCan anyone relate? I\u2019ve recently begun meeting with a therapist who seems fine, supportive, and understanding. She\u2019s given me a few strategies to manage symptoms (grounding and mindfulness, although the mindfulness strategies were there from years ago when it started). Grounding hasn\u2019t helped much yet; mindfulness/meditation is a bit more effective. \n\nThe root cause of anxiety is fear. Fear of fear, in my case. Fear that the physical symptoms my body manifests will shut me down. Fear that my two kids (8 and 3) won\u2019t have a functioning parent when anxiety takes hold. Fear that my spouse has to pick up the slack (note: he\u2019s amazing and we\u2019ve had specific conversations about this) and because of his long hours at work, he\u2019s physically unable to. \n\nSo... tbh I feel slightly better after writing this. Maybe sharing my experience and journaling specific pieces of my anxiety is therapeutic after all. I welcome any and all thoughts, stories, experiences. I\u2019ll probably write again soon. \n\n\u262e\ufe0f",

I always close my eyes and tell myself that there\u2019s nothing wrong and it\u2019s just a test but still i freak out and get a high reading. \n\nThank you for your time!",

            "selftext": "So I\u2019ve actually gotten to know my anxiety pretty well. I know what triggers me, sometimes, I know the physical symptoms, I can pinpoint where I carry tension, and I have a bag of tricks that work for me to calm down. I have anxiety induced IBS and haven\u2019t had a serious inflammation in a bit. \n\nI started a new job and have a date this weekend. I woke up this Monday morning so nauseous. It\u2019s like my college days. Everything I eat gives me diarrhea. No appetite. This time luckily I knew what was going on so I feel like I\u2019m not really anxious in my brain, just in my body? And I\u2019m sleeping like a rock which is a god send. \n\nSometimes I stop sleeping for a few nights when I\u2019m anxious. Sometimes it just goes away but before I\u2019ve taken Xanax, felt the blissful relief, get a good nights sleep, and that honestly does it for me, I keep sleeping well. It\u2019s like I jsut need that little push, and it unites the knot, like a reset button. It\u2019s been a while since I\u2019ve lost my appetite like this, and I was hoping it would take the week and go away but no such luck. \n\nI\u2019m thinking of taking a Xanax jus as a reset but am not super sure on timing. My anxiety is at its absolute worst in the morning. By midday I usually can pick at some food and am pretty relaxed by night. I don\u2019t especially want to be on Xanax for my date, but I\u2019m nervous about taking one in the morning, and by evening feeling that terrible feeling of being flooded with panic for no reason. \n\nI could take it tonight, the night before, and hope I wake up fresh? Or tomorrow morning when I\u2019m at my most anxious? Or a bit before the evening time so I keep it away for my date. What do you all think?",

Anxiety triggered that same night because Dr Google said I had fatal symptoms of Covid. Long story short, my mind jumped from serious disease to serious disease for 4 months and prolonged the stomach bug for nearly 2 months because of the anxiety.\n\nFast forward to last month, my anxiety getting under control and my appetite finally back BUT I developed an internal hemorrhoid from all the junk food so unnaturally but naturally I thought CC. Next day I focused all my stress into stomach...like Goku made a spirit bomb...I could just feel all the anxiety channel to my stomach.\n\nLast few weeks I've been getting control back but stomach issues (not nearly problematic but uncomfortable at times) flare time to time. I can feel the anxiety trying to work it's way back when that happens and worry about what I'm feeling. Anyone else get over anxiety related stomach problems? How long did it take to subside? Anyone still going through them?\n\nWhat I feel random times throughout the day and majority of the time when I'm sitting:\n\nStomach might turn, not a pain but like a spot of discomfort that jumps around right side, nausea seems to be pretty much gone, light pressure in stomach. \n\nI feel like I'm so close to beating this but the finish line keeps getting pushed inch by inch.",

            "selftext": "Life in Los Angeles was changed dramatically during 2020 and I wasn't prepared for it.\n\nIt is hard to remember what life was like before, but I remember being busy. I was on a kickball team that played every Sunday, I worked a Monday-Friday Job which of course took up at least 40 hours a week. It is funny when you work a job that's 40 hours a week it really takes up a lot more once you factor in lunches, getting ready, travel and everything else. 40 hours means just sitting at your desk but it actually takes up even more time. I always thought, once I graduated college and found a good job, life would be complete. What I did not know is how hard corporate America is. If you get sick, if you have lots of Dr. Appointments and you are not on an executive or manager level, life gets difficult. At least that was my case, I could never keep any PTO time because I was always using it for my appointments. How are we supposed to keep up with everything if we get such limited time off, it just made it impossible. My last job in LA was working for Colliers International. Wow., I thought, I had a great boss who was flexible, treated me nicely and overall was excited to be working there even if my office was in a parking garage (which I hated). The point of what I just wrote is that once all this is taken away from you, your job which you spend so much time at, your social activities that you looked forward too, life changes and questions arise. Such as what am I on this Earth for? What am I supposed to do with my time. I remember my mom saying to me, how are you going to pay your bills. My response was, well isn't that why you made me - so I can work to make other people (companies) rich and pay bills to do basically do the same thing.\n\nI was not prepared though for all these changes because on March 15th life as I knew it, really had changed. We were out at a Drag Show celebrating my Birthday with a couple of brave souls who came out even when the pandemic was just starting. That day, our Mayor issues that all bars must shut down and we partied until they closed. We did not know how long this would last or how intense it would get. Shortly after, Safer at home orders were issued. Suddenly, I am working from home and scared every day that I have contracted COVID-19. Suddenly my job went from manageable to beyond stressful. My boss\u2019s efforts to make sure we were adding value to the properties we were managing meant harassing tenants for rent due and tracking a portfolio of failing businesses. Prior to Covid, I saw how small businesses in retail and restaurants were already struggling. I saw the difference between anchor tenants (Target, Ralphs, Best Buy) how they are treated versus small businesses. Large tenants are permitted to have large balances and avoid much harassment from the landlords, the philosophy that they will always pay in the end. With small businesses, they do not get the same leeway that large companies do. As these small businesses had their income drop to levels never seen before, the large companies were still open and, in some cases, thriving. How is this possible? Well the definition of \"essential\" really meant Target, Ralphs were able to stay open and were busier than ever while most small businesses were closed, restaurants struggling to conform to take-out only and sales dropped (we had to track sales each month and it was staggering the drop). All this really started to weigh on me as I am seeing small businesses go out of business and the owners pleading with me to help them.\n\nCombined with what felt like my life being put on hold, my social life ended, my anxiety went through the roof. Suddenly, I was beginning to feel like I could not sort anything out in my head, work was becoming intolerable and I felt like I was falling apart. I become depressed, was not sure what my future held or what my role was on this planet. I became even suicidal thinking how much easier it would be to leave the world then continue to live here on the Earth. This of course scared me even more because I have battled depression and situational bi-polar disorder before, and I felt that it was back. Every day I was crying, and the ups and downs became too much for me to bare. I had to seek out help. Seeking out help wasn\u2019t as easy as I imagined, I had a primary care Dr., who basically said it\u2019s a tough time for everyone., you just have to hang in there and speak to a psychologist. Seems easy enough, except with my insurance I was not able to get an appointment for weeks which was like how am I going to make it weeks when I am not sure I will make beyond today. I called everyday and every location to see if there were any cancellations and tried to just keep swimming (just like Dory). Finally, probably about 2 weeks later and 3 over the phone Dr. appointments where I was having panic attacks, I finally had a video chat with a psychologist. He starts out by prescribing me about 4 medications, one to help me sleep, one to help my mood, one for anxiety and one for depression. I am not someone who likes to take a bunch of medicine, but I knew I needed a lot of help. My biggest immediate stressor was my job when I asked my primary care doctor or psychologist to place me off work each said the other doctor should be the one to do it. California has a short term disability program, which is basically a state wide insurance plan which money comes out of our paychecks for but neither of my Dr\u2019s wanted to place me on disability instead opting to say it\u2019s the other Dr\u2019s responsibility. I decided I had to get another opinion. I reached out to my previous primary care Dr., who agreed to help me even though my insurance did not cover her. I would have to pay for some services out of pocket (a video call for 15 minutes is $450)., but I thought it is a small price to pay to get some much-needed relief.\n\nThis was the day my healing journey started and what a journey it has been. She placed me on disability for the month of June., and step one is to inform HR and then your boss. Colliers had a leave plan where basically if a Dr., takes you off work \u2013 no problem just go through Liberty Mutual Insurance and they handle the leave claims. You just need a Dr. diagnoses which I had and a treatment plan which I also had. My boss was less than happy that I was taking time off and the last couple of days I worked he barely spoke to me. My district manager sent me a crazy email with a snarky reply, saying sorry working from home has been so hard on you. You must remember a lot was happening. George Floyd had been murdered, I had friends who had Covid; we had curfew in LA where we couldn't be out past 8 P.M. somedays. I was just not able to process everything that was happening. I would watch the news and just be crying the whole time. I would be crying during my meetings at work, I just was so unhappy and lost. Now its almost June and my Leave of Absence is approved by Colliers.\n\nIn June, I started therapy in addition to my psychologist and my therapist suggested I also incorporate Group Therapy. But by June I had already been surviving for about 2 1/2 months of extreme anxiety and depression with little assistance or understanding what I should do.\n\nI was reluctant that this group therapy could help me but decided it was worth a try. The group was called mood boosters and it was a 6-week program that met virtually and it was starting at the end of June.\n\nEven after not working during the month of June, I was still experiencing a lot of anxiety, depression and insomnia. I then had a follow up appointment with my previous primary care Dr., near the end of June. It was decided that I should be off work for July as well to continue working on my mental health. I sent in all the necessary paperwork into HR and my manager but didn\u2019t hear back which I thought was odd because HR had even called me asking how I was, if I knew when I was coming back to work etc., a very cordial email exchange was had previously. I did not hear back for about a week until Friday about 2:30 P.M. I receive an email saying my Leave of Absence extension had been denied and that benefits would be ending in 4 days. This HR representative stated that someone would reach out to me Monday but that she had no further details for me. I was so shocked and texted my manager right away. He initially said he had no idea and would investigate. Later that day at about 5:30 P.M., he texts me that the company is doing poorly due to tenants not paying rent and that they\u2019ve decided not to extend my leave of absence along with he believed I\u2019d still be able to return though.\n\nThe weekend hits and I am unsure what is going to happen, if I will have insurance \u2013 my husband is under my plan or even have a job anymore. Monday roles around and I do not hear anything from them. I email everyone like hello can I get an update what is going on here. Finally, I get a call from HR who says my boss is also on the line although I never heard him say anything. HR goes, okay Alex your termination date is June 30th\u2026..this lady did not even know who she was terminating. Alex is my boss who was on the line. They offer me 2 weeks pay and 1 month of payment for cobra which is $1300. The call lasted 2 minutes at the most and suddenly I had 1 more day left as an employee of Colliers.\n\nThis was a hard blow for me to swallow. First, I was not going to have insurance in 2 days in the middle of a pandemic, I had just started group therapy and take medicine every day that helps to keep me alive. I became even more stressed, anxious and just upset with how my life was turning out. They wanted me to sign a 6-page document which said, that I would not ever say anything about Colliers that would tarnish their good name, etc...\n\nI declined to sign and got a lawyer. 14 days later they offered me my job back. I couldn\u2019t believe it; I remember reading the email from my lawyer in disbelief. How could I go back to a company that treated me so poorly and what would my life be like if I went back. I decided I could not work for them and this was a ploy to stop me from suing them. Imagine going back to work like Hi everyone, just had to hire a lawyer to get my job back; I did not think I would be treated very nicely by management if I went back as well.\n\nIt\u2019s important to note that my husband and I were able to get insurance for July 1st., through Covered California (thank you ObamaCare)., I was able to continue my group therapy because I found an option on there to go with a plan similar to the one offered by my previous employer.\n\nWhat makes this story even crazier is that when I started working from home, the phones were forwarded to my personal (not re-reimbursed) cell phone. June 1st I texted my boss because I was surprised that even though I was off on Leave., in which you are not supposed to do any work (company policy along with a requirement of being on disability)., the phones were still forwarded to me. I gave him a heads up the phones were still being forwarded to me and his response was, \u201cthank you.\u201d June 1st, I still took a meeting with a lady from our Marketing department because she had questions on a project I had been working on, even though I informed her I was already on leave. For the whole month of June, I was still getting all of Colliers calls to my cell phone. With no way of knowing which call was for me or which call was forwarded; I was still working. Answering tenants\u2019 questions and directing callers to the right resources. I thought this was what they wanted me to just to, \u201chelp out,\u201d even though I was on leave and not getting paid.\n\nThe day Colliers informed me of my impending termination; I sent out an email CC\u2019ing everyone of importance asking for them to please stop having the phones forwarded to me as I was still getting a lot of calls. No response. This continued until the end of July. Keep in mind, I would get phone calls any day of the week at any time and had sent many emails requesting that this be stopped, all which were never responded to. During June, I had even had to send codes to my boss and answer questions what I did not know is that they had a TEMP who was pretending to be me. I checked my work emails, to find that in June the Temp was impersonating me. He was using my work computer with my log in and had just emailed tenants pretending to be me. I couldn\u2019t believe it because I had also sent a couple very personal documents to HR via my work email which this temp had access to; along with all my log in\u2019s and chrome passwords etc\u2026, it made a lot more sense too because I never knew what tenants were talking about when they called me but they made it seem like I had just been emailing with them.\n\nFinally, the calls stopped, and it felt like a big sigh of relief but the scars of how I was treated remained.\n\nMy Dr. ended up extending my disability until the end of September. As I am still battling Anxiety and a little bit of depression, but I finally feel like I am on the mend. I finally feel like I am starting to be able to be myself again.\n\nStarting tonight I am starting a 10-week Cognitive Behavior Group Therapy and my goal for the end of it is be able to move through life, stronger than ever. I think there is no shame in asking for help and recognizing when you need it. My healing journey is not linear and has found many obstacles, but one thing is for sure, each day I get a little stronger. With that I can smile knowing I am doing the work and starting a new chapter in my life. Los Angeles is opening up slowly, I am still scared of COVID but I know that no matter what happens the future is bright not just for me but for everyone. We are going to get through this and I believe be stronger than ever.\n\nWe have an important election coming up, so it\u2019s important that if you not registered you do and then actually vote. This is our chance to have our voice heard and we need to hear everyone\u2019s voice, it what makes a democracy work. Take your time when you fill out the ballet and read all the directions because we also must make sure our voice is not thrown out because we did not follow a direction or missed something.\n\nI am excited to restart my blog and start my next chapter.
