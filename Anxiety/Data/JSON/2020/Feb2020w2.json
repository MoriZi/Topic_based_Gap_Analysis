After graduating college I\u2019ve struggled to keep a job for longer than a year.  I am recently unemployed as of last week and anxiety is at a peak.  I have issues sleeping and also issues of even being able to get out of bed.  I feel like such a lazy asshole and blaming it on my depression just seems like an excuse but it truly is a chore just to get out of bed in the morning.  I\u2019ve lost passion for all of my hobbies and just sit on reddit all day in bed on my phone.  I\u2019ve tried 5 or 6 different SSRIs and now I am on Prozac and it doesn\u2019t work just like all the pills I\u2019ve taken before this.  The only thing that helps is my klonopin script but I always run out about 2 week before my next psych appointment and my doctor refuses to give me more.  I feel like I\u2019ll never be able to hold a job with my anxiety and panic disorders and it\u2019s quite discouraging.  I\u2019m not quite sure why I\u2019m posting this, maybe just to get it off my chest and ask if anyone has any helpful tips to get out of this slump.",

How the friendship ended wasnt clean or concise it just ended out of nowhere. There are times i just post memes or articles coping with loss and feelings of anxiety never naming anyone on social media. Then one day she just outs herself on my posts calling me obsessed and creepy and such saying i should stop with all of that. Not saying shes wrong i couldve had more of a different outlet but having someone who caused it telling me to seek help was kinda a kick in the teeth i was just wondering not that i want myself to be like this always having anxiety attacks barely sleeping. Is the obsessing part of having anxiety? Or is it just me?",

            "selftext": "Hello everyone,\n\nI haven't been on Reddit for a while, so I apologize for any posting taboos/mistakes in advance.\n\nSo, I have anxiety. I grew up in an abusive home and have had it since I was about five years old. I was an angry kid growing up and crazy depressed in high school. My anxiety worsened in university \u2014 to the point where I knew I needed to see someone. So, my anxiety/depression/OCD wasn't officially diagnosed until I was 19 (I'm 27 now). \n\nI was on several different medications when my diagnoses were first provided. I was on Cipralex at first and then moved onto Ativan for panic attacks. I was also given a stronger antidepressant, but I forgot what it's called. While I was on my second round of medication, I weaned myself off of it before having to see my doctor for a refill. I felt that the pills weren't working any better than writing and therapy was. I was also fairly sick of having to constantly up my doses. \n\nI haven't taken medication for about two years now. I've been in therapy, though, and write all of my anxious thoughts down in my journal. However, I feel as if my anxiety has only gotten worse over the last year, despite these coping mechanisms. I'm seriously apathetic, constantly on auto-pilot, and am experiencing disassociation. I often feel as if things aren't real, dangerous situations won't hurt me because none of this is really happening and that I could blink at any moment and my whole life will disappear. Like, all of this is a fever dream.\n\nI don't know if any of this is normal or if things are only getting worse because something more serious is going on. Is this common in people with anxiety? I certainly haven't experienced disassociation before, but I'm going through it now more than ever. I also haven't gone through anything particularly traumatic in the last few months, but I've been disassociating a lot since January. \n\nI was wondering if anyone else experiences this and if so, what methods I could use to keep myself grounded.",

            "selftext": "\n\nI am a 20 year old female, with a 16 month old son. I got pregnant when I was 18 years old, the guy was 32. We met at his work (he sold me a vehicle) and I was super into him immediately. I found that as we went on dates, I was very confused. I noticed he was very dry at times. He barely texted me, didn\u2019t try to hold on much of a conversation on dates. Then other times, he was a lot of fun. I think I was just excited someone older was into me. I had sexual experience before and a couple \u201cin school\u201d boyfriends, but he was the first real guy I actually went on dates with. I got pregnant very fast. I knew him about 3 weeks, and was pregnant. I tried really hard to make things work for the fact we had a child together and I wanted us to make this work and be a family. He promised me he loved me, didn\u2019t want anyone else, wanted to spend his life with me. I was very immature and broke up with him every other week. Once I found tinder in his phone and he told me that it was there from before we met, but I never remembered that. I was very drunk that night and we were staying at a resort for his work function. I got upset and left the hotel room. I ended up in his co workers room asking him to call my boyfriend. He tried to feel me up. He was a disgusting old man probably early 50\u2019s. My boyfriend came to the room and just said \u201clet\u2019s go\u201d. He never tried talking to me about the tinder thing. He never tried apologizing. He made no effort at all to really be with me. The next issue was when we were supposed to be moving in together. I expressed I didn\u2019t feel safe in the neighborhood at one set of apartments and he said \u201cwell I won\u2019t be outside\u201d.\nHe was very selfish. \nWe broke up a bunch more then got back together after he came to one of my ultrasounds. Finally broke up for the final time. \nAll I wanted was for him to try. I wanted him to be more of a man, take more initiative to make things work instead of just letting me go so easily. He truly made me feel like he didn\u2019t give a damn about me or my safety. He was 32 and a virgin. He never had sex before or a girlfriend. He had issues staying hard and thought his issues stemmed from his childhood. \nHis father murdered his mother and step mom.\nEven though me and him broke up, I secretly was hoping he would try to change or work on himself. Or that we could at least be friends and raise the baby right together. \nWe had a lawyer together and sat down and made a parenting plan.\n3 weeks later he gets into another relationship with a woman. He never ask how my pregnancy is going. I had to get upset and argue with him about why he seemed so uninterested in the pregnancy. He acted like it was an issue to buy baby supplies knowing I was only 18 and a student. \nInstead he could go over to his 37 year old girlfriends house and give her money for loans and spend time with her child. He knew this woman 3 weeks, and wanted to introduce her to me. \nI was 6 months pregnant, in constant pain, and he wanted me to meet a woman he has known less than a month. I was a floored.\nShe helps him pick a custody lawyer and I get severed with a battle that costs my grandparents $14,000.\nHe involved her in my pregnancy. Let her listen in on our phone calls. He even tried asking to be in the delivery room and I was on the news. Then he tried suing for the baby to take his last name even though we were never married and I was the primary custodian. I was on the news again. \nI did some research on his girlfriend to find out she is a radical atheist. She says people who believe in Gods are shit and deserve to die. She is off the wall politically crazy, and every word out of her mouth was profanity. She had a history of drug use and prison time. The local police department said she was a troublemaker. \nI expressed all this to him and he had no problem with it aside from her cussing. I cried and cried for him to please drop the attorneys and just try to get a long for our child\u2019s sake. I couldn\u2019t believe he wanted to expose our child to something like that. \nHe ends up breaking up with her the month our son is born. The judge put her in a parenting plan that said she is to never be around our child. \nFast forward a few months and the issues still didn\u2019t stop. He wanted overnights at 3 months even though I was breastfeeding. He wanted people I never met around our newborn. \nI didn\u2019t trust his judgment anyways after the woman he tried to bring into our child\u2019s life. I started coming over having sex with him. I wanted to get back together with him to make things cordial enough for our son. That led to me falling deeply in love with him. Getting married. And now, I\u2019m pregnant again. I have already scheduled an appointment for an abortion. \n\nI have suffered from panic attacks since I was 12 years old. I had a fear of big open places. Once I left whatever was triggering me, my panic went away. My anxiety has gotten significantly worse. Starting in October I have had to call an ambulance out multiple times. My attacks get so bad I cry, hyperventilate, I get dizzy, my heart rate goes up. I feel like I will die. \nYesterday it was so bad, I had to take half a Xanax. It calmed me down immediately. \n\nMy question is, is me focusing on the issue of him being with another woman and putting me through that a part of my OCD and obsessive thought process, or is it a warning I should leave him? I love my husband with all of my heart. He has apologized many times, and said he would never do that to me again. That he knew it was so wrong. We\u2019ve been doing better. The thought of leaving him makes me physically sick because he does help me through my panic attacks so much... but yet I wonder if he is the reason I\u2019m having them. \n\nI think about this constantly and the entire situation makes me sick.. and it was 2 years ago. This has been going on since September. I am wondering if I should leave him, or try to make this work?",

Fearing I was a monster I kept it in, for more than 15 years. Today I wrote a long letter and delivered it to my psychiatrist. Within 5 minutes I got a call that I have to see him tomorrow. I'm terrified. To make matters worse I came home and my mom pressed me on how I was doing and when I told her about the letter she again pressed about what it said. She then blew up and started telling and throwing things. Telling me my mental illness effects everyone around me and that if I was anxious I just needed to go out and do stuff. I felt so ashamed and hurt that I've been hiding out since.\n\nTo clear up my harmful thoughts are excessive and detailed but they be are thoughts. I don't intend to act on them and don't think I could even if I choose to. My friend told me she deals with the same thing and it's known as harm ocd. I hope this sheds light on a subject that perhaps isn't mentioned much in r/anxiety and I hope that if you suffer from this you get help rather than feeling like a monster",

            "selftext": "Im in my last year of school and have offers to study maths at uni next year, i never really thought id get to this point because ive struggled with anxiety and depression and shit mental health, for what feels like my most of my life. I know its a massive acheivement to get this far but now that ive got these offers even the thought of uni stresses me out to no end. Ever since i got my first offer ive just felt stressed constantly and its starting to take a real toll on me. Ive got my exams in June which decide if i go to uni but the stress and anxiety im feeling is stopping my doung work in lessons and revising. \n\nPart of me knows why im stressed, but another part of me doesnt. The idea of uni is freaking me out, ill be living away from home and have to make friends and interactt with people . I havent had any friends for years and i dont talk to anyone at school and usually im fine with that. I dont find myself craving the social interaction and the few times i ever manage to go to a social event i find it really boring and stressful and end up wishing i hadnt even bothered.\n\nAnd tbh ive feel ive spent the majority of the last few years in a depressed haze. Ive been majorly depressed for my teen years and i feel like ive missed out on development not just socially but also mentally if that makes any sense. Like i have no personality, im the most boring person alive, i wouldnt be my own friend.\n\nI just feel so lonely i have no one to talk to. And even though usually it doesnt bother me, infact often i dont even notice it. But currently i have so many thoughts going round and round my head and i have no one to talk to. The only person i talk to is my 9 year old brother. But hes half my age so they dont really count do they. I also talk to my mum but its usually just about my brothers. And i havent told her how im feeling about uni, partly because i know she will just say that i dont have to go this year but i know that if i dont go this year i wont ever go. I know it doesnt make any sense but i do know myself. Also she would just tell me i need therapy. And i know i do, god theres so much trauma that ive just sortof squashed and try to forget about. I know i need therapy but for one the autism complicates things also the idea of therapy makes me so anxious that i dont want to do it. But i also dont feelni can tell my mum how im feeling because i know shes already really stressed out dealing with my brothers who have there own share of mental health issues. Thanks for that dad.\n\nI dont know what to do, i dont know who to talk to. I just feel like such a burden on everybody. And i know im as low as i could be but i also know if i leave things as they are then im gonna get to that point again. Where im wanting to chuck myself off the roof or just wishing for a car to veer of the road and run me down. But also why bother talking to anyone when there nothing they can do, my heads just so fucked up",

            "selftext": "I am not sure if this is the correct place to post this, but really just sharing this seems warranted at this time for me. Forgive me if out of place. \n\nLong story short, I had been self-medicating anxiety with sex, alcohol, work, and fitness for many years. I always felt the undertow of anxiety, pulling me into chronic dark mental places if unattended - and figured staying busy was the best solution. I took up meditation and other coping mechanisms in my teens, which seem to keep the wolves away from the door and instead roaming along the mental tree line, where they belonged.   \n It wasn't until I turned 30 that I began to really investigate the subconscious origins of my anxiety. It was a very serious relationship, actually, that caused me to question my beliefs and my thought streams more seriously. \n\nThe origin wasn't a surprise. It was the root of a dark tree, sprouting rotten fruit that I knew very well, but pretended didn't exist. It was my childhood. I won't delve into it. But one of my first memories in this life was sitting in the back of a police squad car, with blood on my forearms, sirens dancing through my iris - desperately watching my mother try to murder her lesbian lover with a hammer in our front yard, in Daytona Beach Florida. \n\nI decided to do what I've never done, go to therapy. Initially, they were impressed with the amount of self-awareness I had around the issues and the methods I developed to cope. \n\nBut they had a next-level solution. 3 milligrams of Klonopin per day. \n\nI knew that road leads to a dark place, but in this moment, immediate relief was more important - as my inquisitive nature into my repressed memories seemed to have unleashed new bouts of rage. \n\nI took the Klonopin as prescribed, and felt better than ever. In fact, I stopped drinking. The thought occurred to me that this is how life must feel for the more fortunate people with Rosey childhoods, or proper brain chemistry. \n\nThis newfound self-awareness, which felt like a lucid dream, soon became a putrid nightmare. My wakefulness and mood started to slip. My entire attitude became dependant on a refill. \n\nI, against my better judgment, decided to stop taking them after a very fast rief 3-day taper.  Ambitious? yes. Stupid as hell? Even more yes. \n\nI ended up waking up at work to police and EMT's standing around me. Apparently I had a seizure and was unresponsive for 7 minutes. \n\nMe, being the well-adjusted adult I am, woke up in a rage that people were standing over me. My employer ended up letting me go because \"this makes us look bad\". My doctor, who is now under investigation for overprescribing patients, cut me off with a 3-week taper. \n\nI had to sell everything I own, flee my home, and spend 90 days shaking in bed at my grandparent's house. \n\nWith the help of CBD, meditation, cold showers and the slow grind of time, I  have somewhat returned to this world.  Moved to a new city, started a new career. Slowly getting back into the gym, etc. \n\nBut, I will never forget the feeling of having to go through job interviews, my face is maniacally twitching with every word I speak and every smile I half- attempt. \n\nI will never forget squinting at daylight with a raw nerve for a mind and hoping that this heart palpitation actually kills me this time. Egging it on to finish the job. \n\nI will never forget finally falling asleep after 4 days of tremors and waking up to the bed soaking wet and shaking. \n\nI will never forget these things, but I don't remember who I am. \n\nIt's been 8 months. I am going to keep going.",

            "selftext": "I already posted this in r/mentalhealth, but I want to post it here too since my issues seem to primarily be anxiety...\n\nTo give some context, I've been dealing with anxiety and depression for many years - since I was a kid. Although I can function, I have been absolutely miserable for most of my life. I can't find joy in anything. I just fake anything positive - in reality, I'm almost always scared. I worry all the time and cannot stop it - I've gotten so worked up from the anxiety that I've actually (mildly) dissociated many times. The real world is terrifying. I feel like a burden on everyone, and I feel like an idiot with no potential. I know it's illogical, but it doesn't make a difference. I can't just talk my way out of it, and experiences in my life don't encourage me. If anything, it makes me feel worse because I continue to feel awful despite positive events in my life.\nIt all kind of came to a head a few years ago. I was going to go into a medical program at community college. I did very well in my coursework, and made it into the program. I immediately dropped it; I had very intense anxiety for almost a year and just knew that if I kept going, I would have a breakdown - if what I was having wasn't the beginning of a breakdown, or a mini one (I wasn't really...functioning). I knew it wasn't for me, despite doing well in the classes. Despite working hard for it, dropping my place in the program was an easy decision.\n\nI had been passively suicidal for a few years before then, but this time it just got more intense. I researched methods. I probably wouldn't have gone through with anything, or I would have picked a shoddy method like slitting my wrists or overdosing - one with a high chance of failure. I posted on Reddit asking for advice then, too. Someone suggested making a drastic change in my life, since I really had nothing to lose. I decided they were right, and instead of taking any plans I had further, I chose to get my bachelor's degree so I could teach abroad. I've definitely still had my moments where the suicidal ideation has gotten more intense, at times it's been more active than passive. But I chose to keep going. I wish I knew why. I worked to gain experience to help me teach. I took courses that were terrifying because I knew they would help me be a better teacher and a better individual. I pushed myself to get out of my comfort zone. It's been so hard making it through these past few years, but I've somehow made it through.\n\nI was successful; I'm going to be leaving in about a week to teach overseas. I've prepared for this specific job for a full year, and I've invested a lot of time and money into it. I am literally about to leave my job, sell my car, etc so I can move across the world in 10 (!) days. I'm not ready for this at all. Despite everything I've done, I'm convinced that I'm going to fail or have another breakdown - but this time, I'll be on my own. I feel like I'm delusional for even trying to make this big move. I thought I had a handle on my mental illnesses, but they are really really overpowering me right now. People tell me not to discount the hard work I've put into this. They say I worked hard and remind me that I graduated with highest honors from community college and university. They point out that I've done all of this on my own. I wish I could say I felt proud, but in reality I know that my \"success\" was fueled by anxiety. Every single assignment and class felt like torture, like life-or-death. I had to continue to do well, or else I may as well drop out.\n\nI wish I attempted suicide a few years ago instead of choosing to do something like this. Maybe then I could have actually gotten help for this anxiety and depression. I've gotten therapy multiple times and tried about five medications since the medical program fiasco, but I still feel like I struggle to cope. It's silly, because I function very well. I just don't know if I can handle the stress of leaving my life and going across the world. I've been crying for the past two weeks. I can't focus at my job. I've been obsessing over this move at unhealthy levels. I feel like I'm already losing my mind.\n\nIf I don't figure out a way to manage this soon, I will have a breakdown overseas. I'll be out thousands of dollars to return home, and I'll have to deal with the shame from ruining my life and showing that I can't be a real adult. I'll have to deal with it without any insurance, since leaving this job means I'm also out of insurance.\n\nI'm so, so scared.",

            "selftext": "Hello! To start, I\u2019ll give a bit of background.\n\nI  go to a relatively prestigious \u201cbaby Ivy League\u201d university. I  transferred into this school after completing my associates at community  college. I transferred here on a full tuition scholarship that several  other community college transfers were awarded. We were all members of a  summer program together at the university prior to transferring and  this experience was amazing to me and I bonded a lot with the people in  this program. Most of the people I made friends with in this program,  however, did not end up transferring to this university.\n\nThe  university I now go to is incredibly affluent, very preppy, and not  diverse. The summer program I was a part of was for low-income community  college students and I suppose is mainly meant to increase the economic  diversity of the university. Luckily, I am one of the more \u201cwell off\u201d  individuals from this low-income group. In other words, a lot of other  people that did this summer program came from much worse backgrounds  than I and they had to go through a lot more shit in their past to get  to where they are now.\n\nMy feelings  of depression stretch back to the latter end of high school (I am 20  now). After getting out of the high school environment, I somewhat  flourished in community college. I felt like I could be myself and I  became happier, even though my social anxiety could still be crippling.  But everything was going well! In May, I met my first girlfriend and we  hit it off over the summer and we are now in a long distance  relationship as she goes to a school about 3 hours away.\n\nI  typically think of myself as a pessimistic person and I always expect  the worst of the future. This led to me thinking the summer program  would be awful, but it ended up being amazing! So, my expectations of  coming to this university, for the first time in god knows how long,  were incredibly optimistic and I couldn\u2019t wait to start my junior year  on campus.\n\nBut as soon as I arrived in August, it feels like everything that could go wrong did go wrong:\n\n1. On night 1, I had to stay up until 5 in the morning because classes were already hurting that hard.\n2. I  rarely saw any members from the group of community college students  that I transferred with, as I don\u2019t share a major with any of them.  Also, I am very unproductive when studying/working around others, so in  order to get all my work done, I basically had to isolate myself at all  times. Also, they are all SO goddamn motivated. All of them. They own it  and love that that is a trait of our group. But I\u2019m not motivated at  all, so I feel like I don\u2019t have anyone in this group who I can relate  to.\n3. I  joined the crew team, as their workout regimen is really good and was  similar to what I was already doing, but I figured it would be a good  idea to join to meet some friends and to force myself to stick to this  workout regimen. But, as a transfer, I was isolated from the  upperclassmen because I was a first year rower...and I suck. I\u2019m like  54th out of 55th on the team. So as a transfer, it is an odd position,  as the first years live in the same halls together and they all have the  complete meal plan so they eat together, but I\u2019m not able/willing to  socialize with the upperclassmen as they look at me as a first year and  have already known each other for 2+ years.\n4. Long  distance relationships just suck. I found that out quick.  Miscommunication is easy and I am constantly missing her. It got better  as we both got more used to it though. Also, it sucks because we each  took turns visiting each other every weekend. So while I\u2019m with her, I  don\u2019t want to be bogged by work so I have to push really hard during the  week to get mostly everything done before the weekend. I love our time  together though and I wouldn\u2019t sacrifice it for anything else.\n5. I\u2019ve  been sick since August essentially. I have a terrible immune system as I  have a chronic condition, so I\u2019ve basically had a cold for 5 months. I  got over it over break but of course as soon as I came back it came  back. I can\u2019t take medication for it because it conflicts with the  medication that I have to take for my chronic disease.\n6. The  overall social culture of this school is overwhelmingly stuck up, upper  class, and generally unfriendly. I feel like I\u2019m on the outside looking  in. It\u2019s to the point where you stick out if you wear sweats around  campus. It\u2019s a very \u201cuppity\u201d atmosphere and everyone just seems so damn  motivated and naturally smart. It\u2019s a good thing, I don\u2019t look down on  these people because of how they are, but I definitely don\u2019t fit into  this culture. For example, at 9am in a very difficult physics class, the  majority of people will be sitting there, looking slick af, smiling  (like wtf), and asking competent and relevant questions to the professor  and seemingly understanding what\u2019s going. Meanwhile, I\u2019m sitting there  tired and unable to understand what\u2019s going on. It feels demotivating  and isolating.\n7. Overall,  it just feels like people have their shit together when I don\u2019t. People  are more mature, motivated, and overall just seem to be happier and  more well adjusted.\n\nIt  feels like everyone is very motivated in their major and truly enjoy  doing their work and searching for research opportunities and  internships. They enjoy speaking with the professors and having  intellectual conversations with each other. What do I want to do? I want  to get my work done, so I can watch a video game let\u2019s play, smoke weed  and chill with my girlfriend, or just relax and chill by myself for 2  seconds. But these aren\u2019t productive. But I have to be productive. I  feel like I cannot sacrifice this scholarship, especially in my junior  year, but I just feel no intrinsic motivation. I\u2019m just motivated by the  fear of what happens if I stop. I have no motivation or passion in  life, so if I were to stop, I feel like I\u2019d just become a loser.\n\nIn  conclusion, I feel out of place, lonely, overwhelmed, unmotivated, and  I\u2019m not sure what to do. I\u2019ve talked to therapists, but all of them have  said I\u2019m completely normal. I\u2019m going to my next appointment tomorrow,  as I really feel that my depression is getting worse.\n\nAny advice? Thanks.",

            "selftext": "I thought about posting this in /r/relationships but I kinda know that there's nothing I can do at the moment.  I'm just panicked.\n\nLong-story short, I broke up with my fiancee last spring.  It was a super slow burn and I pretty much left the relationship feeling fine, I had grieved it and healed from it while I was in it...if that makes sense. So I was casually dating over the summer, but not really investing in anyone.  Finally, I decided around October/November that I wanted to get back out there and start dating, I felt ready.  \n\nIn comes a woman, let's call her Jane.  Jane and I's first date was far and away the best I had been on (I was on about 7-8 first dates between my fiancee and this date, so I feel that's a good sample size).  She was legitimately everything I wanted.  I must have a dozen things I wanted in a new partner, expecting to find someone who hit 3-4 and be ok with that, only to have Jane hit all 12.  We met up for a 2nd and a 3rd date, each one more spectacular than the last.\n\nTowards the end of the 3rd date we talked about what we were looking for and I confessed about having a broken engagement the year prior, expecting it to be a red flag/dealbreak, the usual anxiety.  Only it turns out that she had a broken engagement the year prior too, around the exact same time.  I can't explain the feeling I had when she said that.  It made me realize how alone and broken I had felt prior to meeting Jane.  Having a broken engagement at 27 years old felt like a scarlet letter, like I was broken and there was something wrong with me.  I felt whole again, and I didn't feel alone.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMonths later and we've fallen deeply in love, albeit quickly, but not once in my life have I felt this way.  I have never felt so connected, nor loved someone so deeply.  I was in a 7 year relationship prior to this one and not a single day felt close to what I feel for Jane every day.  I didn't believe in soul mates until Jane, I didn't think I could ever love someone the way I love her, and I **hate** saying that because it makes me sound like a 14 year old.  It's only been a few months!  But when you know...you know.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHowever, Jane's relationship ended differently.  I left because we were headed in two different directions, and to be quite honest I just slowly fell out of love.  I left and never really looked back and immediately felt happier and more like myself.  Jane was cheated on and was shattered from it.  She really only dated as a means of slowly acclimating herself to her new life.  She didn't expect to meet me, for this to happen.  She's still getting over her loss, but doesn't want to lose me.  So it's definitely been a struggle for her to heal while she's also with me.  We've talked about it, and I've tried to be incredibly understanding, and I think I have been.  I let her lead.  She asked me to stay over the first time, she said \"I love you first\", she was the one who wanted me to meet friends first etc.\n\nBut she confessed last night that she feels like she's been lying to herself.  That she's trying to force herself to be ok with being in a relationship, when she may not be.  She wishes she met me six months from now when she could be a true partner to me, and not have this emotional wound she's still carrying.  It came to a head last night when she said she didn't know if this relationship was good for her.  **I** was good for her, but the timing might not be.  She doesn't know if she could heal while being with me, but at the same time didn't know she could love someone as deeply as she loves me.\n\nJane's going on a trip this weekend to see an old friend, and I have a ton of work I need to do.  So we're taking a break from the conversation until she comes back, but still talking over the weekend.  However, I can't help but feel like I'm about to lose something that I'll never ever regain.  I don't consider myself an emotional or dramatic person, by any means.  I pretty much shrugged off my 7 year relationship/engagement.  So me feeling what I feel now tells me how rare it is.  And I have no idea if I'll ever find it again.\n\nI'm just beyond myself at the moment with anxiety, and I can't focus on anything or do anything.  I feel like I'm losing my mind.",
