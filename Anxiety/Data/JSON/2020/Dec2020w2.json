            "selftext": "Hello, I am 30, 31 in two days time. I've been living with depression and anxiety for 16 years, managed quite well for  13 years, then due to work and health related circumstances I had a break down and had to reach out for help. I have had CBT, multiple medications and nothing has worked to help me get back to a manageable mind frame, I am currently house bound, I can't work as I can't leave the house without my wife anymore. My anxiety is heavily focused on the social aspect, I can't talk to a stranger for more than about 2 minutes while alone, and then even when with my wife she has to input on my behalf heavily. My insecurities and paranoia are centered on my own self critical thoughts, I have lived the better part of my life believing I am scum, worth less then the air everyone else breathes, undeserving of happiness, I was a huge self saboteur, used to self harm a long time a go. This year has been horrendous, we lost out baby, was to be our third child, at the beginning of the year, we had to make the choice to end the pregnancy early, then coronavirus happened, getting stuck in the house, not a huge loss for me being a huge hermit and anti social and full of anxiety, more of a impact on my wife though. Which leads to the past week, I thought I was handling this year better than I actually am, thought I had everything under check, more motivation, less shouting in my mind, calmer and cooler. However this is not true, my wife, whom I should clarify we have been married for 3 years, together for 9 years and known each other for 15 years, best friends, we are each others soul mates, not a term I really like to use but it is the case for us, which is why I am having such a difficult time. My wife has started doing a great thing, doing things to make herself feel better, just little things, getting dressed daily, started yoga, make up on daily, she also deals with anxiety and not liking herself, so it's great that she is taking steps to feel better in her own skin. She watched a lot of YouTubers, especially The Sims tubers, which led to twitch, which led to other streamers that don't really play games she's interested in, but the people themselves are grand people, then she becomes friends with some of them, super, we are both friendless, have been for ages, just been us, especially this year, this took place over a few months, then this past week, she became best friends with one of the streamers, male, straight, long distance girlfriend, has issues of his own not my place to say. He needed a friend the other night, my wife was there for him, good, answered the phone to him, the only person she will talk to on he phone is me, has been for years, she has huge anxiety when it comes to phones. First time I felt it, paranoia, jealousy, the undeservingness, then I thought I picked up on her being secretive, putting headphones on, so she doesn't distract me, taking her phone upstairs on a night more, talking to this new friend, a lot, like the level we did when we first got together, like when you have a crush, I got so stupid with it, started ignoring my wife, acting like it was falling apart, when there was no evidence of what I was thinking, in fact the evidence proved the opposite, my wife still told he daily she loves me, there was no gap, no love lost, she was just, or is just having a new friend, and her own anxiety makes he need to talk that much and respond fast so in her words doesn't upset anyone, she finally pulled the truth from me, and understood me, understood why I was being this, why it hit me hard, and I got over it for a day, then got stupid again, my paranoia and anxiety niggling in the back of my brain, shouting at me that something was happening, I got quiet again, we had another good cry and talk and I told her more of my feelings, again got back to normal, then without realising I was still judging her, kept looking when she picked up her phone, this was yesterday, we argued, cried, talked and all the soppy stuff, she still loves me, and now I hate myself even more for letting things get like this, I loathe myself on a daily basis, my biggest flaw is how critical I am to myself, every time I have looked in he mirror today, I have felt physically repulsed, just wanting to hurt myself, punish myself. My wife has offered for me to talk to her friend, even asking me to just lurk on the streams, join in when I'm ready and join the group become friends, or at the very least find someone to talk to, make friends of my own of I can't join hers. So TLDR, I am a mess, need advice or just a friend, I have no-one, don't want to worry my wife more than needed with my inner most thoughts, but I can't keep going on like this, I am so angry at myself right now, like I am the devil incarnate on my own eyes, I usually play video games to distract myself from my thoughts, works for the most part, but right now I can't do it, I have no interest in anything but despising myself and wanting to make sure I don't upset my wife more, the only thing in my life that matters to me is making my wife and children happy, somehow giving them the life they deserve, but I think I need to do what my wife is doing right now, find a way to be happy with myself or at the very least for the mean time not hate myself so much. I profusely apologise for the length of this super essay, but I don't talk to anyone at all so, I have less social skills than a limbless mime, so I find it hard to condense or just talk, sorry.",

            "selftext": "Hello everyone, heres a little bit of background: I am a 21 year old male who has always been somewhat of an anxious person, but around January this year, it got a whole lot worse. I would notice that when I was at work or would meet up with friends in a public area I would start to feel extremely short of breath. Not just like, mildly winded, but I mean barely breathing (or at least thats what it felt like). My fingers and toes would go numb and I would feel like I was going to pass out. I noticed that eating a full meal before leaving the house would help a lot with that, so that gave me a peace of mind and I was able to continue doing the things I enjoyed. Then COVID hit. While we were on lockdown, i started running daily and that helped with my symptoms as well. When we came out of lockdown and I went back to work, I noticed my anxiety manifested itself in a different way. If I was around too many people I would start to get dizzy/ feel unsteady and would start to have a mild panic episode. The only thing that would calm me down is if I got away from everyone and sat down and took deep breaths. \n\nWhen summer came along, I noticed a little bit of relief, but not for long. More confusing symptoms just keep arising when I am put in anxious situations. At the moment I am mostly dealing with a strange heat sensation creeping up my spine when i start to get nervous. It's so weird. Other times it's uncontrollable shaking. My therapist thinks I'm having mini panic attacks. \n\nDoes anyone else experience these physical symptoms? If not, how does your anxiety manifest physically for you? Does klonopin help with the physical symptoms? \n\nThanks in advance!",

            "selftext": "\nI have a super crazy boss who's unorganized and tells us stuff in the last minute. She also treats everyone horribly. Usual crazy boss situation. It has caused me to have constant anxiety because anything wrong that happens is my fault and she usually acts rude towards me when she's stressed or if I make a mistake. I'm on constant edge waiting for to scold me or get mad at me. I've never felt this way in a workplace until I started working here. Its been a culmination of events at work that has made me this way.\n\nSo a few weeks ago my boss told me about a conference and a presentation proposal to see if I would be interested in submitting something since my boss was also interested in submitting something. Problem was that my boss shared the info with me 2 days before the proposals were due. I replied back that I would be interested in submitting something but would need more time to plan what I wanted to do. Boss replied back with that they will check with organizers to see if they are extending deadline for proposals since it got sent out late to everyone and let me know\nSo after that week I went on vacation for a week and forgot about it.\n\nFast forward 2 weeks after my vacation, boss comes in today and asks if I submitted a proposal for the conference. I was surprised and said no, since the deadline had passed. Boss proceeds to say that they extended deadline and that proposals are due today and asks why I can't write something quick. I told her that I was thinking about submitting something with another coworker. Boss proceeds to say that I should have followed up with her and essentially blames me for not checking with her about the extension.\n\nMy boss does this alot and blames others for her mistakes or lack of communication. I know it's partly my fault for not checking on it.  I keep blaming myself and feeling guilty. But I hate how she acts towards me.  Any tips on getting past making mistakes and dealing with people who are rude.",

            "selftext": "Accepting your thoughts does not necessarily mean you agree with them - it means knowing who you are/want to be, and taking the high road. It means making the decision to engage with them or not (hint; we think 1.6 thoughts per second, 99% of them are garbage/random); don't take your thoughts to seriously or personally.\n\nImagine your most radiant self. If you struggle with this, imagine somebody you really admire (a family member, friend, religious figure, cartoon character, whatever). Somebody who shows love, kindness, patience, or whatever strong values you hold.\n\nWhen that inner critic arises looking to beat you up or start an argument, focus your attention on that person you admire/you want to be. Would they agree with what that critic says? Know that the critic will never bow down, no matter how hard you argue with it... maybe like a boomer on facebook over anti-abortion laws. As much as you disagree with that boomer's opinion and want to prove them wrong, you can focus your attention elsewhere in another meaningful, constructive manner. Think to yourself, \"you are wrong, I appreciate where you're coming from, but arguing with you is pointless. I have other important things to focus on\".\n\nThe first few weeks of doing this will be hard. Those criticizing, nasty, and negative thoughts will come swooping in at full force. Some days will be harder than others. They will retaliate with vengeance. \"You've fed us for so long, where's our attention? Where's our food?\"\n\nMindfulness means choosing your thoughts. It means focusing your attention to the qualities you value, and knowing that all that overthinking, those intrusive, unwanted, negative thoughts are just **distractions**. Those neural pathways have been fed for so long- with reactions like anxiety and depression, which reinforces your brain to think they are important. But what if you chose to disengage with them? What if being powerful meant focusing your attention on what matters to you- instead of wasting your precious present moment on living in a \"should've, would've, could've\" world?\n\nWhen those thoughts become too intense and overflowing, be gracious with yourself. Imagine that radiant self/person you look up to holding you and saying, \"it's okay to cry and feel. It's time to ask for help. It's time to take care of yourself; journal, breath, exercise, play a video game, ask to raise your medication dose... you will be okay, and I am here for you. This moment will pass. Just don't give this feeling or thought the power to consume you,\"\n\nPeople often journal incorrectly, which is why they say it doesn't work. Set a timer for 10 minutes and word-vomit all your negativities and anxieties. When that timer goes off, look at those thoughts and identify the [cognitive distortion](https://psychcentral.com/lib/15-common-cognitive-distortions/) and [create a new thought](https://www.therapistaid.com/therapy-worksheet/socratic-questioning/cbt/none) with that in mind. At the end, think of 3 things you hold gratitude for- it could be anything that resonates with you.\n\nFor more information on ACT (acceptance &amp; commitment therapy) here are some [worksheets](https://thehappinesstrap.com/upimages/Complete_Worksheets_2014.pdf) that my own counsellor approved for me to use; google is also a useful tool.",

I usually do it on the day it runs out and go down to the pharmacy to pick it up after 5pm, but not only did I forget to order it until the day I ran out, but this time I also forgot to go and get it. \n\nThat meant I had to go the full weekend until Monday with no medication. I started having mild withdrawals and felt like shit. \n\nThat being said, I am incredibly proud of myself. I forced myself to eat tea downstairs with my family, and I then refrained from buying alcohol to make the night easier. I barely smoked too, compared to the usual amount. \n\nI\u2019m just very proud of how I dealt with running out and coming off the meds, :) thanks for reading",

It\u2019s killing most days, and on days when it\u2019s not, I am still anxious for the next killing task on my way. I don\u2019t know what I would do next, or if I will be able to. It feels like forever that I\u2019ve been stuck here, I am overwhelmed, unsure and going insane every day. And I know these are enough reasons, yet somehow I am not able to take the step and have some faith in myself that I am not completely vain. Any advice would be appreciated. \nThanks.",

A dog can't consent and this is absolutely disgusting. I don't think I interpreted it as a sexual thing, more like a funny thing. I didn't take it seriously. But a dog can't say no or yes and I feel like I forced him to do it. \n\nYou can hate me if you want. I feel horrible.\nBtw, I'm 24 years old. Not a teen.",

            "selftext": "I have been doing kick boxing for almost 5 years now and I\u2019m one of the more advanced students at my martial arts gym. I am young so a lot of the time I am up against people who are bigger than me.\n\nToday was my grading so that I could move from my blue to red belt which meant I had to do 6 consecutive 2 minute rounds of sparing.\n\nOn my 5th I was pared up with a much bigger guy to just to boxing and he knocked me around good. He got me good a few times and it really took the energy out of me.\n\nFor my sixth round I had to spar with one of the very advanced people in my class but that 5th round really took the energy out of me. During the 6th round to catch my breath I backed away and sort of adjusted the pads that I was wearing but in a way I was just trying to catch my breath. \n\nNow I feel this extreme guilt because I was being graded on these fights and it feels that I cheated in a way.\n\nI am just venting.

(\"this is a sort term situation; this too will pass; remember that compared to X happening, this isn't so bad;\" etc.)\n\nMy SO has always had some level of anxiety, at times crippling. Over the many years we have been together I have tried to help when things get bad for him.\n\nBut recently I was put on an anti-cancer hormone blocker. I was having some typical physical issues, but the WORST was the anxiety. Any little stressor was sending me into spiraling thoughts that would not stop. And the thoughts were always the worst-case scenario type. My heart rate would go from 0-60 and then not calm down for hours.\n\nI felt like my body was betraying me. My mind was trying to have the same calming conversations but my body was like \"RUN RUN RUN this is BAD\".\n\nI had a follow up with the doctor last week and while in the waiting room I read an email that, on a normal time would piss me off but I would deal with; this time my blood pressure shot up, heart pounding, face flushed and honestly I was glad because the doctor got to see what I was talking about first hand. \n\nHe immediately took me off the drug. It's been 5 days and I already feel soooo much better.\n\nAll of this to tell you all that now I understand the inability to get into a more calm place no matter how hard you try, your brain just won't let you. I told my SO the same thing: *I get it now*.",

My nerves are about to break. My head is a mess, my sleep is a mess and my face is a mess too.

My family have only just stopped screaming at me for it. I feel like such a failure. I made it all the way to the last year, and crashed out with four months to go. I just don't know what to do now",

            "selftext": "Alright. So this is gonna be a sorta long post, and most probably gonna get buried. So if you're reading this, thank you, I really had to get this off my chest.\n\nMe(16) and my family moved to a new country just over a year ago, and the first 3-4 months were terrible. Constantly anxious, and super alone. It was terrible. The main issue my anxiety stems from, is being alone. I just hate being alone. It's terribly unhealthy, I know, but I just can't help it. I need constant connection to someone, to something. \n\nSeveral times, the remedy for anxiety is 'work on yourself' or 'take time for yourself, forget everyone else' and I'm sure it's great advice for many, many people, but it just never works for me, just makes me feel more disconnected, and alone. I've always had anxiety to an extent, but before moving I always had friends to distract myself, to make myself feel better. Moving was terrible, and shook me up more than anything else ever could.\n\nThe reason I'm making this post is the past couple months I finally felt like I was a bit better. The anxiety was there, but not constant anymore. The last couple of days, I feel like I'm right back where I was a year ago, and I feel absolutely terrible. I honestly just so tired, and I wanna be 'normal' so damn bad. Like I said, I just feel like I had to shout this at the wind for my own sanity. \n\nHope y'all are having a good day out there. \n\nD.",
