            "selftext": "So, my brothers been like this ever since university. I'm pretty sure the stress of deadlines and responsibilities made him the way he is today. Prior to studying he used to be in a band, used to play video games, was always playing his guitar and was generally a happy person. Now all he does it philosophise about life, tries to convert everyone is to a vegan and says he hates the way the world is. He believes that hobbies are a waste of time and deters you from more important things in life. He preaches how he wants the world to wake up and spends all his time in thought. You can barely have a conversation with him because something is always troubling him and on his mind. Some things are laughably trivial. We keep pushing him to get help, see some psychiatrists, try some medication, but he seems to think he's okay. Some days he'll be so much better and he'll listen to you, but most days he'll brush everything off and won't listen to you because he's over encumbered with thoughts.\n\n My family and I don't know what else to do, we're all so worried. I just want my brother back, my brother who used to wind me up for my shitty Justin Bieber haircut, my brother who I used to look up to because he was cool as fuck playing guitar on the stage in front of hundreds of people.\n\nAnxiety is a bitch",

            "selftext": "Had an uptake in energy these past couple days which I thought meant a turn for the better, I even managed to meet a friend/acquaintance today after turning her down so many times in the past. Thought I could be this positive self I\u2019ve idealised in my head, but instead there was just trauma, anxiety and sadness spewing out of everything I said. Didn\u2019t mean to make her a therapist. Left feeling like pure shit and couldn\u2019t stop crying on the way home. Can\u2019t stop now.  I\u2019m just so fucking tired. Of fighting myself. At least when I have have no energy I just fucking lay there. Now I can\u2019t get hurting myself out of my head. I don\u2019t want to be stupidly self destructive.\n\nLife feels like constantly losing everyone and most pointedly, yourself. I don\u2019t want to deal with anymore grief or pain. I know it\u2019ll happen again and again in the future and I\u2019m terrified of it and I know I can\u2019t cope. I\u2019m 20 and I\u2019ve never even had a job. I\u2019ve just finally clocked that I\u2019ve subconsciously been trying to keep myself away from having money so I can\u2019t buy drugs. I don\u2019t want to lose anymore of myself. But the escapism is addicting. I wish books were still enough. I wish music was. I wish people were. But even my best friend of 16 or what would\u2018ve been 17 years soon, just abandoned me. Maybe we were toxic. As much as I hate her for it I miss her so much I can hardly breathe. I woke up after 3hrs sleep last night, from the sound of her calling my name from the bottom of the stairwell. My brain even perfectly captured the muffling of my bedroom door and the echo of the hallway. I shouted \u2018where are you?\u2019 before I realised it was a dream.  I can\u2019t convey the agonising emptiness when it hit me. Lol. \n\nThere was too much trauma between us. I can\u2019t get the abortion out of my head. Her bleeding all over the hospital floor. Her screaming. Her begging me to save the fetus that sat there right in all that blood because she just couldn\u2019t flush it she couldn\u2019t let it be buried in the cold hard hospital she couldn\u2019t. Using a water bottle to save it and keep it for her. Her switching off and laughing with him again less than a minute later like nothing had happened. The sound of him fucking her and her begging him to stay the day before it happened, when she\u2019d already taken the first pill. I couldn\u2019t deal with it. I stayed with her for a week. We were only 18. There was nobody else. I paid the electric at hers because her mum wasn\u2019t there the entire time. But it was too much too much too much. The nurse told me not to cry, some women came here alone. And all I could think about was my mother. I was 9 or 10 at most, when she told me so excitedly I was going to have a sibling. Sure it would be with the abusive piece of shit that had just invaded our home, but I\u2019d always wanted a sibling. She aborted it a week later, after another fight I think. I can\u2019t remember. I can\u2019t remember most things from back then to be fair. My mind won\u2019t let me. I wish I\u2019d been there for her. I was only a child of course but there\u2019s nothing more heartbreaking to me in this life than her pain. I\u2019m well acquainted with it. Became her therapist. Loved her when she was a raging alcoholic and tried to make myself good enough for her. Every time she got blackout drunk and/or tried to kill herself she\u2019d talk about all of them. The abortions she\u2019d chosen to have, and the one she didn\u2019t when she was only 15. Just a couple days ago she was screaming drunk for her dead mama of about 25years. I\u2019ve dedicated my whole life to wanting to save her and I don\u2019t think I ever will. I want to so desperately. I want to take her pain, all of it. But I\u2019m also so angry. \n\nI tried to explain to my friend how traumatic the abortion was for me. How I couldn\u2019t cope with it. How angry I was at her for guilt tripping me into being there the next year, the anniversary. She thought I regretted it and resented being there for her. That I regretted ever being there. She couldn\u2019t understand the nuance that I was angry that she didn\u2019t understand that I couldn\u2019t talk about it, that she didn\u2019t acknowledge how deeply traumatic it was for me to see that. I didn\u2019t want to steal her trauma. It was traumatic for me as a friend in a completely different way and she struggled to acknowledge that. It\u2019s hard to blame her though. Or me. We were both drowning in trauma. But I\u2019m so angry at her about the acid. She begged me to do it with her for a week and her fucking boyfriend was there and I\u2019m so angry at myself,  I let myself down why did I agree to do it. I haven\u2019t seen her since that day in September. She left me sleeping in her room and I never saw her again. I don\u2019t even know how to process the trip. It was hands down the worst experience of my life. I was going to kill myself. Everything in the world was just so fucking ugly how did I ever see anything good in it. I finally remember HIS face with disgusting clarity after 2 years and I broke down to her. It should\u2019ve been a breakthrough supported by my friend, but instead she saw all the ugly and broken in me and just left. After 16 years. I know I was cold to her bf but I was breaking down about the violence of men I\u2019ve endured in my life, confiding in her how much they terrified me, told her he was terrifying me. And he was so terrifying on acid I won\u2019t get into it. I told him it wasn\u2019t personal I was just traumatised. But she still fucking left me. \n\nOne of my best friends, who was also my first love, told me a couple weeks ago that mum was pregnant. Whilst I haven\u2019t seen them in some time, I love her family. I was with them when her dad went to hospital for another round of cancer treatments. When her sister got hospitalised. I\u2019m shitty at being there in the happy moments but I\u2019m always try to be there when it\u2019s bad. I was so angry when she told me about the pregnancy because what would I do if it went wrong? I could simply not think about it, distance myself from it, but I couldn\u2019t help the love pouring out of me already. I was going to be a tita! I saw a different future, one where I was reliable, focused. I was going to crochet a blanket for when it came. I started learning tagalog. We couldn\u2019t wait to teach it so much. so much. \nAngel Uriel passed away 20/02/20. Rest in peace mahal. \n\nAnd now my favourite person is stepping away from me, is out of love with me. She won\u2019t admit it but I can tell I\u2019m not an idiot. This, I don\u2019t even know how to touch. She won\u2019t call me anymore. She\u2019s there if \u2018I need her\u2019. But ultimately is too much of a pussy to tell me she doesn\u2019t want to be. I don\u2019t blame her. Or well, I do. I\u2019m furious but I get it I hate me too. Since she moved further away for uni in august ( she\u2019d been out of home for 2 years at this point but just further away now) she withdrawn from me, her sister, her mum. I feel like I don\u2019t know her anymore. Like I had a home and now it\u2019s gone. And I can\u2019t even be angry about it or grieve it because she\u2019s trying her best she\u2019s so busy. But I know that\u2019s an excuse. I\u2019m so tired of loving. We\u2019ve been friends for 10 years, she was the first person I ever told about my home life. I was an only child, threatened to be quiet about shit many times in my life, and I\u2019d finally found a kindred spirit. I miss being 12 holding hands with her walking home in the snow. I miss feeling like it\u2019s just us in the world. It\u2019s not even the new people around her. It\u2019s her. It\u2019s her changing her name (not a trans thing, a race thing). Which I\u2019m supportive of it makes her happy, but it feels like the symbolic death of a person I once knew. I can\u2019t deal with this half love she\u2019s giving me. It\u2019s making me feel crazy. I wake up just crying. I go to sleep crying. I don\u2019t know what to do to have that again and I\u2019m scared I never will. I\u2019m scared if I do have that again it\u2019s because I\u2019m finally not depressed all the time. I don\u2019t know how to reconcile with the idea that she\u2019s just straight up repulsed by my emotionality. She keeps on saying it\u2019s hot or attractive, when I deal with a traumatic situation by compartmentalising and not outwardly expressing my sadness/grief. When I say shit like lol I\u2019m tired of crying I\u2019m just getting on with it. It makes me feel worthless at my most vulnerable and pathetic. I haven\u2019t even told her about the baby yet and I used to tell her everything. \nMaybe it was codependent. Maybe I don\u2019t know how to be anything but codependent. I can\u2019t see the point in this fucking life if I\u2019m not connected to someone like that. I know I should be enough for myself but I hate me. Ik it\u2019s not anyone else\u2019s responsibility to stay in that dynamic with me but I\u2019m so fucking hurt. \n\nI\u2019m tired of living in this old body, of pain it holds.",

            "selftext": "Hi everyone, I'm currently working as a kennel hand/animal attendant at a vet clijic while I study for my certification in veterinary nursing (Australian). I love this job and it's been great. \nThe downside is, I'm 6 months in and I still find myself making small mistakes. For example, yesterday I forgot to mark a cage card for urine and faeces. Just one, and it's so basic but for some reason I just missed this one. Tonight is really bad for me as Ive built up a lot of anxiety thinking I've made a mistake at work today even though I've combed through my day several times and the only thing I can think of is possibly missing a cage card again. This has extended to me now freaking out wondering if I remembered to lock up correctly. Has anyone else experienced things like this? I can't sleep; all I can think about is getting that call tomorrow morning saying something was missed. I've never been this anxious about a job, but at the same time I've never wanted to do so well in a job before. Any ideas on what I can do to stop this snowballing?",

It scares me, I am deeply afraid of nothingness. The thought of me dying and the world ending is truly terrifying. I'm not religious but sometimes when having these thoughts I'll talk to go or whoever if anyone is listening and just ask, why?

            "selftext": "Hi guys.\n\nI always have this problem. Someone starts telling me a story about an accident they had or some gory thing that happened to them and I start imagining it with lots of details and I start feeling like I\u00b4m about to faint. It also happens when I just start thinking about gory stuff or remember some gruesome story someone has told me.\n\nI tend to imagine everything that I\u00b4m told with great detail and it sometimes triggers this reaction. It\u00b4s not like I\u00b4m worried all the time that I\u00b4m gonna faint in the middle of nowhere or anytime but when I\u00b4m in the circumstances described above I tend to get into \"dude , you are about to faint\" mode pretty quickly. \n\nOver time I have managed to somewhat try to mitigate it. When I feel like this is about to happen I grab my phone, open Youtube and start watching a random video of my interest while telling myself \"Just relax, nothing is gonna happen, you are fine\". It works but it really takes time to get to a point where I\u00b4m normal again. It really sucks because I think it hinders my ability to take part into some social interactions and I\u00b4m also worried when I watch movies with gore because I\u00b4m afraid of fainting in the movie theater.\n\nThe only time I fainted because of this was after watching a video of some girl suffering of pain because of an infection and rotten skin caused by some drugs. I watched it with my friends for a brief moment and 40 seconds later I fainted. The other time where I have been really close was when I was watching a video about skin removal surgery and the guy talked about the post-op and showed the scars that the surgery left (totally cured , not gruesome at all).\n\nIs this some kind of anxiety? Do I just have a phobia to blood or gruesome stuff? Is this treatable?",

            "selftext": "Hi,\n\nSo I've been with my partner for over 2 years. She's my rock, my best friend and is everything to me. I live with her in rented house and we have just purchased our full house (agreement in place, contracts not exchanged yet). We have 4 kids in total, 3 from her previous relationship and 1 from mine, all kids under age of 12.\nWe used to make time to go on date nights and we still go on occasional getaway and up until recently I thought all was well, I'd never second guessed it really other than our occasional spat.\nIt's important to say I've just had a promotion also to manager at my job which I love - it's second nature to me but the commute can be stressful to me. She recently.got a night shift job as an admin and we only see each other in early.mornings during weekdays as well as an hour usually before she leaves for work when I get back from home.\nThe honeymoon period ended a while back so that's no concern to me, our sex life slowed down a bit but I suspected that's just how relationships go (certainly has been the case in my prev relationships at least). Our kisses turned more to pecks and lips aside from during intercourse where we are pretty active bit not as so we were at the start. She comments on this occasionally over the last half a year or so but it's never caused is any great problems.\nFast forward to yesterday, we went to take the kids for a viewing of the house we are planning to move into once solicitors have finished their work etc. I was just getting ready to leave combing in the mirror and bam - full blown, shaking, stomach cramps and panic attack. Pure anxiety. I've no idea what caused it, but all I could think of after was do I love her the same still? If you asked me if I love her I would say yes, I believe I do with eveyrthing I have but there's thoughts running throughout my head asking if I'm in love with her, why doesn't it feel the same as it used to? We are also moving the kids away from their schools to new place 35 minutes away so they will see their dad less and have to go through new school process.\nI'm terrified, I feel like everything I've felt and worked for over the last year's is falling apart. I've spoken to her about it and she's trying to be understanding but I know I'm.scaring her and we are on a time limit to pull out of our purchase of the house. I don't know what to do, where to go or how to act. I can't sleep or eat and I've been sick with worry and an anxiety thinking about it.\nI'm going to see a GP tomorrow morning to see if they can give me anything to calm down but important try and see a therapist or counciler of some sort as I know I need to speak to a professional.\n\nI hate what's happening. I don't want to lose her but I know I'm making it worst being this way - I simply can't help it.\nI'm usually the bottled up type, I keep myself to myself mostly to a fault and only express anger on a whole, but I've been crying on and off over last 2 days over this.\n\nIs this relationship anxiety? I spoke to my parents who my dad suffers with anxiety also and says this is nothing to do with my partner it's because of the major changes and stress in my life recently.\n\nIf I could take a pill to go back to feeling how I did 2 days ago I would in a heartbeat.\n\nDoes anyone have any advice? Please, I'm desperate.",

            "selftext": "I just need to get this out because I guess I just had an awakening. \n\nBackstory, diagnosed with OCD when I was 10 which I got under control by 15 and have been managing fine since until now. Then when I was 18 I was diagnosed with anxiety for which I\u2019ve been on and off Zoloft for the past 10 years. Fast forward to now. \n\nThe core of my anxiety comes from being raised to be perfect and to always follow my parents commands. I was an only child and terrified of defying them so I always but them first. Catholic school did not help. Fortunately my parents recognized the stress they were putting on me and by the time I was 10 pulled back, but the damage was already done. \n\nI come from a family of attorneys and always knew I did not want to practice law. I just wanted to be a mom - sahm, or work in an office setting making enough to get by as an assistant or something. I never had crazy career dreams, but my parents did.  I just wanted to raise a family. \n\nI was afraid of defying them and due to high student loans I went straight to law school from college. I did very well but after 1L I had a mental breakdown. I did not want to do this. Too much stress and it triggered the anxiety in me that I had when I was a child. I did not like it enough to pursue, but I was afraid of defying my parents. So I continued and restarted my anxiety meds to get by. \n\nFast forward six years and I landed a great job  which I\u2019ve been working for almost three years now. And I still hate it. I still have to see a therapist and psychiatrist monthly for no other reason than dealing with this profession. \n\nNow, for the past maybe two years, I have not had a social life. I push myself so hard during the week that I turn down plans or events with friends on the weekends. In fact, I literally just sit on the couch and vegetate the entire weekend. The most I will do is go shopping or to the mall to just get out and breathe. I have not seen my friends in over a year. This is not normal. \n\nMy husband and I started trying a year ago and got pregnant in May. I was in the middle of a huge project at work and more stressed than usual getting barely any help from anyone. I miscarried and I blame the stress. That is when my mental health took a serious nosedive. I have not been able to properly concentrate at work since. We could not get pregnant despite the doctors not finding anything wrong with us. Finally, we did through IUI in November and are expecting our first baby girl in early August. \n\nIn November when I found out I was pregnant all of the stress and anxiety of work melted away for months. I could care less about anything other than my growing baby and was totally exhausted doing what needed to be done and whatever else I could. Again, there was no help. But as I entered my second trimester, that euphoria disappeared and anxiety and OCD returned worse than it ever has. The multiple annoying OCD rituals I can deal with, but not the anxiety. This isn\u2019t normal. In dealing with it, I\u2019ve been able to put things into perspective. \n\nFor the past two years, I had patches of anxiety lasting a couple months, then subsiding for a month, then another anxiety patch, etc. for a period of five months straight though, I cried every day on the way to work. And throughout the entire time I\u2019ve worked as an attorney, I\u2019ve had panic attacks as frequent as once a week, crying and worrying if I did something wrong or how something would turn out the worst. This isn\u2019t normal. \n\nI got into an argument with a client this week where some personal things were said to me and I realized this isn\u2019t normal and this isn\u2019t fair to my child. I can drown myself in the anxiety and stress on my own but I can\u2019t with my daughter. It\u2019s not fair. I can barely function on the weekends now, forget during the week.  I can\u2019t do this. Crying daily before work isn\u2019t normal. Not seeing your friends for this long isn\u2019t normal. Vegetating on the couch every weekend isn\u2019t normal. Weekly panic attacks aren\u2019t normal. None of this is normal in the face of the fact that it all stems from a job, and it cannot continue. I need to leave, and I am leaving once this baby arrives. \n\nSo now I\u2019m faced with the reality that I\u2019m going to let my parents and myself down. I know I have a lot of talent and I\u2019m afraid of not seeing what I could become. I am in massive student debt complicating things. But we will deal with it. \n\nIt\u2019s embarrassing going to law school and working for as long as I did only to drop out of the profession completely and do something entirely unrelated. I don\u2019t know what I\u2019ll find out there and I\u2019m scared shitless. But this is my life, my health, my daughters health, and my family. \n\nI stayed this entire time because I lacked courage. I\u2019m realizing for the first time now that the first step to moving on is finding the courage to do so. Baby steps. I\u2019m taking comfort in that. \n\nDealing with this during pregnancy feels impossible since I\u2019m without Xanax and klonopin. But Knowing I\u2019m not going to be voluntarily doing this in the future is helping. This is stupid. I feel stupid throwing it all away but a job is not worth getting sick over. \n\nI don\u2019t know why I\u2019m posting this and if you\u2019ve read this far thank you. Just needed to get it off my chest.",
