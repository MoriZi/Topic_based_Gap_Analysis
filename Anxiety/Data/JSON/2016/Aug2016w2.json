            "selftext": "I have a experienced a LOT of panic attacks in my life and unlimited amount of anxiety but this year life it's better because it does not trigger that much.\n\nBefore I go into the tips I just want to make something clear: No matter your situation and symptoms you can always improve and easy your anxiety. Here we go:\n\n1. Quit Caffeine. ( this was a huge step)\n\n2. Hang out with friends and do this a lot ( if you don't have any just go to the nearest coffee shop drink your lemonade and watch people passing by\n\n3. Eat mostly clean but if you crave something just do it once or twice a week. \n\n4. Meditate at least 15 minutes a day ( especially when times are bad is when you need it. ) \n\n5. Go exercise. I can't stress this enough it has helped boosting my mood and my self - esteem a lot \n\n6. Sauna, Jacuzzi, Massage . Do those, sometimes the tension we feel is trapped inside of our bodies and we really need someone to get it out \n\n7. Force yourself to go outside the house everyday even walking 5 minutes.\n\n8. Rest and do this a lot, don't find this as an excuse to proscastinate but really take a break you might be doing too much and some things people do efforless we put to much energy and struggle to do it and that burns as off. Just rest. Play your favorite video game, have a beer if you like, talk to someone just take a break. \n\n9. Talk to people: Just say hi and contunue your day, this will help you understand that people are not monsters and they won't bite you. \n\n10. Always remember that you are awesome and your life it's the most precious and important thing you have and at the end it's you vs you, bad times maybe here and you think now that they won't surpass but DO remember and believe that it will get better and it **WILL** you just have to help yourself.\n\nEDIT: I hope this helps, take care guys please! \nEDIT 2: Oh oh oh and don't forget to be patient!! That's really really important.\n",

You can still eat bad food, just eat less of it. Make bad food the exception, not the rule.\n\n**Exercising**\n\nTry to get some kind of exercise in at least once a day, it's incredibly helpful for your brain. I lost close to 100lbs and now I'm in great shape. Remember, you don't burn fat, you exhale it. Find an exercise that will elevate your heart rate and get you exhaling more.\n\n**Resting**\n\nDon't forget to get your rest, try to sleep 8 hours a day. I've found this is also incredibly important for my brain.\n\n**Becoming more goal oriented**\n\nHaving something to work towards can often take your mind off the things that are worrying you.\n\n**Less social media**\n\nSpend less time on social media in general. Go outside and enjoy the world!\n\nThese may seem stupid and simple, but they have worked for me and I wanted to share.",

            "selftext": "When my anxiety rears it's head, the main result is sleeplessness, which then leads to worse anxiety, and on and on. I wake up in the night, realize I haven't gotten much sleep, then feel even worse, and just descend into a helpless, scared panic, unless I can head it off, usually with the help of drugs. \n\nThe past few nights I've been listening to [Sleep With Me](http://www.sleepwithmepodcast.com/). It's a podcast wherein the host tells long, rambling stories designed specifically to captivate but not excite the listener. The idea is to keep your attention, distract you from yourself, and ease you into sleep. I woke up last night, starting out of sleep with a jolt, and normally that would have meant a restless night. But I had left the podcast playing, and it gave me something to focus on besides my fearful thoughts. I was back asleep within ten minutes.\n\nThe host has an inimitable quality of voice to catch your attention and hold it, but to let you drift along with him, filling his stories with boring details, side plots that go nowhere, embelishments that don't add anything, little asides that always seem about to reveal something profound but just sort of lilt back down like a falling leaf. It's not like white noise or beach sounds or whale song because there's an actual \"narrative\" that tricks you into paying attention. And all in a voice that's part Bob Ross and part bored DMV clerk; it's hard to describe, but the host - Dearest Scooter - has a tired, earnest voice that you *want* to listen to, but never *says* anything. There's no coherent plot, but you're never tempted to switch off, because the next moment maybe - *maybe* - it will lead somewhere. It's hypnotic and distracting and it puts me out like a light.\n\nI know what it's like to be trapped away from sleep. I was skeptical of this podcast; it seemed too simple, too easy. If anyone else here has trouble sleeping, or you need something that will distract you from your thoughts without further exciting them, I cannot recommend this podcast high enough. It's free and there's hundreds (400+ and counting)* of episodes. You'll never run out. Please please *please* try this. It could help you. I hope so. \n\n*edit\n\nhttp://www.sleepwithmepodcast.com/\n\nhttp://www.dailydot.com/upstream/drew-ackerman-sleep-with-me-podcast/\n\nhttp://www.newyorker.com/culture/culture-desk/the-podcast-that-tells-ingeniously-boring-bedtime-stories-to-help-you-fall-asleep",

            "selftext": "The first step towards managing your anxiety is to be able to identify your anxious thoughts. To help you do this, please read the linked post about identifying problematic thinking patterns: \n[Be aware of your distorted thinking](https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/4p6r8y/be_aware_of_your_distorted_thinking/)\n\n\nKeep a journal to help you identify what types of anxious thinking you engage in. Think about which types of negative thought patterns interfere with your life the most and focus on those. \n\n**Have realistic expectations.** The goal is not to completely eradicate your anxiety. The goal is to manage it. Expecting to get to a place where anxiety is no longer a problem for you is setting yourself up for failure and a form of perfectionistic thinking.\n\nRemember that even though you struggle with anxiety, you can still be happy. You can still live an interesting, pleasurable and rewarding life. Your life doesn\u2019t need to be perfect in order for you to be happy.\n\nOnce you have good idea about what types of anxious thinking you engage in, you will need to generate new thoughts that will eventually replace the old, anxious, thoughts. \n\nThe goal is to use your conscious mind to beat the new thoughts into your stubborn subconscious using repetition, practice, and effort. This will take a lot of work and time, but that\u2019s ok. \n\n5 tools to help you generate new thoughts:\n\n**1) Generate new thoughts ahead of time:** Write down what your anxious thoughts are, and then beside them write down what you *wish* your brain would automatically think instead. \nNext time you are in the situation that makes you anxious and your subconscious starts being a dick; use your conscious mind to repeat the new, positive, thoughts, which you generated earlier, over and over again. (Obviously just do this in your head, don\u2019t do it out loud or you will look insane) \n\n**2) Probability flow chart:** Think the situation through by making a probability flow chart about your anxious predictions. \n\nMore often than not, we underestimate our ability to cope with \u201cbad situations\u201d and we overestimate the likelihood that these situations will actually happen. \n\nMake a flow chart: Identify your anxious thought. What is your anxiety telling you about the probability that your prediction will actually come true (probably 100%)? What is the objective probability that it will actually come true (probably &lt;5%)? Really focus on how the objective probability of this \u201cbad\u201d thing happening is much lower than what your anxiety is telling you.\n\nOk now lets say your anxious prediction actually does come true. Continue the flow chart. What is your anxious prediction about the situation that would follow? Assign objective and anxious probabilities to the new prediction. Now what if this one comes true? Continue on the flow chart assigning anxious and realistic/objective probabilities to each new link in the predicted chain of events. \n\n Continue on to show your mind that is it overestimating the likelihood of these anxious predictions.  Since these are dependent events, the probability of the very worst thing possible actually happening, (the prediction at the bottom of your flow chart), actually coming true is next to zero. \n\nThis tool is slightly abstract so here is an example: [Probability flow chart example](http://imgur.com/a/IIhVf)\n\n(Math geeks: For fun, determine the final probabilities using the rules of dependent events for both the realistic probabilities and the anxious probabilities. Notice that the final probabilities are incredibly lower than you would think! Even for the \u201canxious\u201d predictions)\n\nPro tip: really think about the \u201cSo what if this does happen\u201d before you move on to the next prediction. You\u2019ll often realize that very few things are as important as your anxiety makes them out to be.\n\n**3) Method of extremes:** Generate new thoughts by asking yourself and writing out answers the following three questions:\n\n1) What is the worst possible outcome of (the thing I am anxious about)?\n\n2) What is the best possible outcome of (the thing I am anxious about)?\n\n3) Ok, what is the most likely outcome?\n\nThis one is a nice quick way to get your mind thinking more rationally by looking at positive extremes for balance. \nOften us anxiety-ridden folks focus on the first question (the negative extreme) without giving any thought to the other two. Get yourself thinking about the other two. Make conscious efforts to answer the 2nd and 3rd questions.  The more conscious thought you spend on alternative views, the more your subconscious will begin to accept these views. The brain is an incredibly malleable organ. \n\n**4) Three method:** Recognize that what you are anxious about doesn\u2019t really matter in the greater scheme of life by asking yourself: Will this matter to me 3 minuets after the situation is over? Will this matter to me 3 weeks from now? Will this matter to me 3 months from now? Will this matter to me 3 years from now? \n\nVery few things effect people\u2019s happiness for longer than 3 months. Here\u2019s a TED talk about it: [Science of happiness](https://www.ted.com/talks/dan_gilbert_asks_why_are_we_happy?language=en)\n\nPersonally, three minuets after the situation I was anxious about is over, I don\u2019t think about it at all anymore. While you\u2019re in the situation focus on the fact that in 3 minuets (or hours or weeks or whatever) this won\u2019t matter at all to you. \n\n**5) Change your ideas about the anxious situation.** Instead of looking at the situation that makes you anxious as something to be feared and dreaded, look at it as an opportunity to practice dealing with your anxiety. Decide that it is an opportunity for you to conquer your fears. We all know that exposure to something leads to desensitization. \n\n*Remember:* changes do not happen over night, but if you are persistent and make a significant effort to change your conscious thinking, your subconscious will follow. \n\nMore Tips: Avoid caffeine, exercise vigorously, and don\u2019t fall into the trap of numbing your anxiety with alcohol. \n",

            "selftext": "The other day, I posted on here about how scared I was to go to a Demi Lovato concert I won tickets for in a sweepstakes. None of my friends could go, and I was extremely frightened by the prospect of going there by myself. I've never been to a big city before, and it took a lot of encouragement and positive self-talk before I finally convinced myself that it would be the right decision. \n\nI almost talked myself out of it when my parents offered to let me stay with them for the weekend as an alternative to \"being lonely\" up in Kansas City, as they put it.\n\nAfter I posted about my dilemma to r/anxiety, the positive feedback I received was enough to make me reconsider the concert again, and I decided to drive up there yesterday.\n\nDriving in the city was scary at first, but I managed to stay calm by listening very closely to the GPS and focusing on the road ahead. \n\nOnce I got to the hotel, everything went off without a hitch. I checked into my room (first time I've done that by myself) and I got my stuff ready for the concert.\n\nI managed to get a fantastic parking spot at the very front of the venue by going there 2 hours in advance, and I picked up my free tickets at the box office (to think that my parents had told me that the tickets I won were 'just a scam'!)\n\nI bought a Demi t-shirt and I fucking rocked it! The majority of the audience members were girls, and some of them probably assumed I was gay, but honestly? I didn't care anymore! I made it all the way to this concert *by myself*. I never in a million years thought I could do that!\n\nA wave of anxiety hit me right before the concert as a bunch of teenagers flowed in behind me. They were gossiping about celebrity drama, taking selfies, and Snapchatting which reminded me of the types of girls in my old high school who wouldn't give me the time of day. I got really quiet and anxious for about 20 minutes, worried that I wouldn't be able to enjoy the concert as much as I thought.\n\nBut when Demi hit the stage...*I freaked out*. In a good way! Everyone around me was screaming at the top of their lungs, and I joined in, relieved that any negative attention directed at me was dispelled by the sheer enthusiasm and noise. I even found myself dancing. Dancing! Knowing all the songs and most of the lyrics was an absolutely incredible feeling since I could easily got lost in the music, and, for the first time in a long time, I was actually enjoying myself in a sincere, anxiety-free way.\n\nThis experience was proof to me that I am capable of anything if I put my mind to it. My anxiety doesn't control me, and I can put it aside if I need to. And that's something I never thought I could ever say. Thank you so much for giving me that last essential push of encouragement, r/anxiety. You guys are the best.",

A is putting his arm around our friend (all these \"friends\" are girls, to be clear) to comfort her when she feels sick or upset, and the first time I see him do this it feels deeply wrong to me. Why the touching? Is he unaware of her personal space? And why does she apparently not care?\n\nThen, another day, A casually turns to our friend and compliments her for looking \"very nice today\". Wait, what? You can do that? I think I missed out on that one, too. \n\nAnyways, you see my point.

            "selftext": "My life is essentially falling apart right. I've had anxiety *forever*, and it's always been severe (I have panic disorder, multiple phobias, GAD, and serious health anxiety - I've also started to developed some obsessive tendencies). \n\nI've been this way since I was a child. I'm 24 now. I've seen psychiatrists, psychologists, and counsellors. They've helped in the past, but my life right now is just too much for me. During my last therapy session (about 3 months ago because I moved two hours away and still need to find a new one), we discovered my anxiety was causing mild-moderate depression. I spoke to my doctor about this, and she officially diagnosed me with severe anxiety and moderate depression. She has been urging me to take medication for years, but I've always refused because I have a phobia of allergic reactions.\n\nI finally got the medication during my last visit, but I still haven't worked up the courage to take it. My husband really wants me to take it, and so does everyone else around me. I know I need to. My anxiety/depression is completely ruling my life right now. I almost dropped out of school AND quit my job (a job IN my field!) yesterday. My parents even offered to stay with me for a week while I took it to help ease the anxiety of something happening to me while my husband worked. \n\nI just...need encouragement. The last three months of my life have been hectic: I moved to a brand new city, at least an hour away from everyone I know, I started a REAL job, I am still finishing off university courses, my husband got into a serious car accident and our car was totalled, he started a new job...it's just been a lot all at once and I don't do well with change.\n\nI know that was all over the place. I'm kind of having a panic attack right now, so, yeah.\n\n**TL;DR:** A lot of things have changed in the last few months. I know I need to take medication to control my anxiety/depression, but I'm terrified. Help.\n\n**EDIT: Thank you all for your advice!! I read through all the comments but don't have time to respond to them all. Just know I'm GOING to take the meds either tonight or tomorrow morning, and I will post an update...I need something to keep me accountable.**",

I feel stupid, ashamed and even more depressed or anxious about my situation. \n\nI can't help but look at these people i've wronged to see how happy and successful they are and say to myself \"these people are working their butts off and deserve all that goodness.

I always get this feeling of inadequacy and that I don't really deserve anything good, despite having a good family and friends that care. \n\nLong story short, it's so hard for me to let go of the past.

Well on the first day I had bad heart palpitations and I almost left but I stuck it out. \nI'm so used to Wendy's bullshit I can deal with it and my anxiety but probably not much longer. I wake up crying and all that fun stuff. \nI've been looking into remote jobs but I have no skills, experience, or degree. I just think that would be the better choice while I stay at home and heal. I just can't afford to stay home and not work obviously. \n\nI'm not really sure what answers I even want! but would a work from home job be the better choice with someone like me? maybe I could spend time learning a skill or something... hmm. \nkind of a messy post, anyone wanna join in?",

            "selftext": "Hi All,\n\n\nI've had panic attacks on and off for years. Here's how I solved them. They're actually pretty simple to cure.\u00a0 I hope this helps you.\u00a0\n\n\n1.) First, understand that panic attacks are simply your stress system misfiring adrenaline. It's not a mental illness; it's a physical response designed to protect you. Panic attacks are NOT designed to hurt you and they are physically harmless. They are uncomfortable but not harmful. No one has ever died from a panic attack. When you're having a panic attack, keep telling yourself that it's uncomfortable but not harmful...uncomfortable but not harmful.\u00a0\n\n\n2.) You have to stop fearing your panic attacks. I used to worry about them constantly and the worry would add stress and drastically lower my quality of life. I was afraid that I'd get one and freak out at work or at a social event. It was the worst. Worrying about an uncomfortable but harmless panic attack made it much worse.\u00a0\n\n\n3.) When a panic attack hits, sit still and let the adrenaline rush wash over you. Know that it will be gone in a few minutes. Know that you've survived panic attacks in the future and you will survive it again in the present. Don't try to fight it; it will only make it worse. Tell your panic attack to \"bring it on\" and it will go away.\u00a0\n\n\n4.) Face your fears. If you're terrified of going to a mall because you'll have a panic attack, then go to the mall and try to have a panic attack. The odds are that you won't have a panic attack at all.\u00a0\n\n\nThat's it.",
