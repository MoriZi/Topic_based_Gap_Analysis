            "selftext": "So I'm on Zoloft and I've been noticing over the past month or two that I have days where I have little to almost no anxiety, but then all of the sudden I get bad anxiety for day or two at a time. It sucks cuz when I'm going through my days of no anxiety I feel great and I feel confident, but there is always the thought in the back of my mind that the day or two of bad anxiety is coming. Usually when it does come I'll feel myself getting anxious at night and then waking up with anxiety. I can control it for the most part and push through it, but sometimes (like today where I skipped my night class and stayed at home all day) I just can't bring myself to go about the day. \n\nAt first these days of bad anxiety made me feel like I was having a setback and that it send me back down that spiral I was in last year and years before. But the way I've been dealing with this is by telling myself that I just came off a few great days and that this one day is just that...one day. So I try to remind myself that it isn't necessarily a setback that I have bad anxiety today, but it's more of an obstacle and kinda just \"one of those days\". It doesn't mean it's going to be like this for now on, and I think that's helped me a lot because I fell fast down the anxiety hole in the past (last year in particular) but now I feel like I have a lot more control on myself. I guess I'm just wondering if anyone can relate to this and what strategies you use for when it happens. \n\nI just feel a little guilty for lying around all day and not going to my class and I also had some other stuff I could have gotten done that I didn't. So any advice or kind words or really anything would be appreciated!",

            "selftext": "It's something I'm really tired of hearing of. It's something I get told by those close to me when it comes to hobbies I actually enjoy and generally getting out of the house and making friends. Each time I always say that I wish it were just that easy to change. If I had the choice, I wouldn't constantly be alone at home or afraid to put out what I enjoy to the public, and stand up for myself when someone treats me terribly instead of breaking down. The fear of being judged is just so strong. I know if I say I've been trying, it won't be believed because I have no way to prove it. It's thing that occurs in my head after all. No matter how much I try to explain, it doesn't seem to change a thing. \n\nI think a major part of my anxiety is my fear of being judged by others. I think it may stem from my past where family and people around me would nitpick about the way I hold myself or the way I act. They were usually all really small comments but I feel like they've just stacked up. Now I'm at a point where I want friends, to talk to family, and be proud of something I do...but once I try, I freeze up and my head just gets filled with these 'What if' thoughts. It's not like I visibly have a anxiety or panic attack either, which is both a good and bad thing I guess.\n\nHonestly, I'm just tired of comments like the one in the title and \"Just Relax\". They don't help at all. If I could do those things in an instant, I'd chose to be a kind or chill extrovert and do what I've always wanted to do and get a job, but no. I'm still struggling to fight my thoughts and force myself to not to externally freak out when I interact with people that I know don't care about me like cashiers.\n\nSorry for the vent, I'll admit I just had my mood ruined after being really excited for something. Plus had a bad day of hearing these things yesterday. I've felt pretty alone when I've tried to explain my anxiety. Please feel free to delete this if need be.",

My presentation\nInstead of not trying, I got up, brushed my hair, did my makeup and chose an outfit that made me feel good every single day this semester. Every time I was on campus I made sure I made an effort in my personal appearance and people noticed. \n\n2. I worked hard. \nI didn't let my inner saboteur dictate what I couldn't do. My designs turned out beautiful and one project is now being used as an example for best practice in my unit.\n\n3. I pushed on.\nWhen I slipped halfway I gathered the pieces and kept going. Even though I couldn't get out of bed for two days I didn't give up due to the shame of it. When I started having panic attacks I prioritised and honed in on what needed to be done.\n\n4. I socialised.\nInstead of giving into my social anxieties I talked to people. I made sure to say thank you if they held a door for me instead of nodding, I told a dumb joke if there was an awkward \"I know you but don't know you\" elevator moment, I offered them stationary if they were looking for something, I focused on asking questions about them instead of worrying about what to say when they asked about me. I had someone to talk to every class and I learnt some really interesting things from the people I spoke to. I smiled so much this semester and people smiled back.\n\n5. I used selective honesty.\nI was honest with my teachers, I didn't just slink away or brush myself off when I slipped but I didn't subject myself to oversharing either. It took me a long time to realise I don't have to volunteer information. My teachers don't need to know I failed a subject last semester or that I've struggled through my degree but they do need and want to know if I'm struggling now. It felt good to feel in control of how much I would share while not being dishonest and they helped me when I asked for it.\n\nI'm really proud of myself. Even though my life's messy I'm learning to manage finally. It's definitely not perfect and my mental health definitely isn't 100% but my self management skills improved so much this last three months so I'm kind of thankful to have this anxiety because without it I wouldn't be sculpting out the person I'm becoming :)",

            "selftext": "One of the most troubling issues with anxiety is the constant flow of intrusive and unwanted thoughts in our minds. They flow with such force that it seems unstoppable.\n\nMost often, these are thoughts that can range from mildly unpleasant to utterly scary! When I was in the throes of anxiety, my mind would be beset by the same intrusive thoughts every day. I would constantly think \u201cAm I going insane?\u201d While another part of me would wonder \u201cWill it always be like this?\u201d\n\nSometimes, the thoughts won\u2019t even make any sense. It would be nonsensical. Just a fusion of unrelated words and concepts traveling at lightning speed inside my head.\n\nIt felt overwhelming and as if this wasn\u2019t enough already, I would have music stuck in my head all the time. Sometimes, it would play awful top 40 songs that I would never explicitly choose to listen to otherwise!\n\nIf you are suffering from OCD thoughts, do not worry! You are not alone. We can learn how to make them go away. OCD, which stands for *Obsessive Compulsive Disorder* is when we have, among other things, an obsession with certain thought patterns and feel a compulsive urge to do something about it.\n\nIn most cases, that something we do is to find different ways to distract our attention away from such thoughts. We switch on the TV, put on our headphones and listen to music or keep checking our mobile phones regularly. This may provide some relief, but often, these thoughts almost always return.\n\nA cure always starts with an understanding. Once you understand why your mind is riddled with unwanted or intrusive thoughts, you\u2019ll be able to make them go away. It usually won\u2019t happen overnight, but with patience and understanding, your mind will eventually learn to rest, and the intrusive thoughts will be extinguished.\n\n**Mind Agitated**\n\nAnxiety is a state where our mind is never at rest. It is constantly fired up. Even when we feel like we are resting for a few minutes, we are hyper vigilant in the background and scan for internal and external threats.\n\nBecause of the mind-body connection, when we are in this mental state, our body starts to produce adrenaline in excess. When there is excessive adrenaline, it starts to affect the way we think.\n\nAdrenaline agitates the mind. When we are in danger, we need to think and act fast. The mind feels energized and spends this excess energy by firing off many thoughts that are aimed to tackle the threat. But when there is no immediate outside threat, as it is mostly the case with the vast majority of people with anxiety (how often do we encounter a hungry lion on our daily commute?), the adrenaline powered mind starts to fire off thoughts as a way to expend the excess mental energy.\n\nBut when there is no immediate outside threat, as it is mostly the case with the vast majority of people with anxiety (how often do we encounter a hungry lion on our daily commute?), the adrenaline powered mind starts to fire off thoughts as a way to expend the excess mental energy.\n\nWhat happens now is that we start fighting or try to run away from these dreadful and intrusive thoughts. This creates additional stress, which produces more adrenaline. Remember, the amount of adrenaline secreted in your body is directly related to your stress level. This excess adrenaline, when it reaches the brain, energizes the mind even more and the cycle thus perpetually continues.\n\n**An Analogy**\n\nBy nature, water in a bowl is still. Our mind is similar, such that when we are healthy, it remains still and takes care of the essential functions of day to day activities. Stress-induced adrenaline is similar to dropping a stone in a bowl of still water. When the stone is dropped into the water, you\u2019ll start to see ripples on the surface of the water.\n\nThe drop of this stone has energized the water, which now creates ripples to expend that excess energy so that it can come to stillness once again. As long as we keep dropping the stones or disturbing the water, there will always be ripples on its surface. The more energy we apply to it, the bigger the ripples are. This is similar to what happens in our head. With more and more adrenaline being pumped in, our mind tries to spend this excess energy in the form of thoughts (just like the ripples on the water\u2019s surface).\n\nBy understanding this mechanism we can now come to a solution. To stop these unwanted or intrusive thoughts, we need to stop adding more stress into the mix. We need to break this adrenaline-thought cycle.\n\n**Breaking the cycle**\n\nThe easiest way to break this adrenaline-thought cycle is to stop the adrenaline from being secreted over and over again. You do that by letting your body and mind know that these thoughts are not a threat.\n\nWhen we experience intrusive or unwanted OCD thoughts, our first instinct is to fight them or try to run away from them. This is why we try to distract ourselves in myriad different ways or keep fighting such intrusive thoughts.\n\nWhen we fight or try to flee from the thoughts of our minds we are sending a signal to the body that we are facing a threat. By doing so, we add stress to the body and mind. Our mind cannot hide from or fight itself. Doing so only produces additional stress. This additional stress produces more adrenaline, which keeps these thoughts going.\n\nOn the other hand, when we stop fighting and instead of running away from such thoughts, remain internally steady, we send a signal to our body that the current situation is not a threat and that it can stop producing the excess adrenaline. When this adrenaline stops, the mind stops becoming agitated. This leads to the eventual extinction of intrusive and unwanted OCD thoughts.\n\nNext time, when you have such thoughts, try to face them. Know that they are just excess mental energy and that they cannot do you any harm.\n\nThe nature of your mind is to return to stillness just like water. By letting these intrusive thoughts come and go as they wish and not fighting them, you are not considering them as a threat. When this happens, the body learns to stop secreting additional adrenaline in your blood.\n\nOver time, the mind spends all of its excessive energy and returns to a place of stillness and stops producing these automatic unwanted thoughts.\n\nOne piece of caution is that this practice requires patience. Do not expect these intrusive and unwanted thoughts to stop immediately. It takes weeks or even months for the adrenaline in your bloodstream to return to normal levels. Give your body and mind all the time it needs to return to the healthy stillness which is their true nature.\n",

It's led me to lose a lot of sleep and I've been generally quite exhausted. On top of that, I've just started juggling a part time job with a full time degree, so things are super busy.The best time ever for anxiety to rear its head!\n\nLast night, things really came to a head. Despite being absolutely exhausted, I couldn't get to sleep until about 4am due to worry and feeling generally awful. I was due to be up for work at 6:30, but I just couldn't face it. I'm tired, I feel so anxious and ill, and I just can't function properly today. \n\nMy workplace is generally very chill and I'm on a zero hours contract, so I was able to take the day off without any repercussions. However, I've been overcome with guilt all day about staying home. I feel weak, like a failure, and like everyone is judging me for letting this get the better of me. I'm scared that my SO (who works at the same place I do) will look down on me and be disappointed that I took the day off (even though he's been nothing but supportive of me in the past and I have no reason to think he'd react this way). I'm worried that anxiety isn't a \"serious\" enough issue to take days off, and that I'm just being pathetic.\n\nI guess I'm just looking for some reassurance here. Has anyone else ever taken a sick day due to anxiety? Is it a \"good\" enough reason for me to take time off? I just feel so shitty right now!  ",

The thing is i never talk at school, and i'll have conversations some times but it doesn't revolve around me not saying simple phrases. I've removed all communication from my friends as she requested, I didn't tell her so i'll let her see the outcome when you completely close out socialization \n\nJust thought i'd share that words hurt, especially by someone you thought loved you \n",
