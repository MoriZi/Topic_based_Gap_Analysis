If I don't feel like running, I will walk twice as long. Get moving! Just do it. \n\n2. Weight lifting. When you see yourself becoming more physically attractive you'll have less anxiety. \n\n3. Quit masturbating. No one wants to talk about  this, but if you watch porn, jerk off all the time. Quit that shit. Helped me and helps a lot of people. I'm not a doctor and I don't know why it helps, but it does. \n\n4. Eat better. Doesn't take much effort or money. Start by cutting out the junk food. Eat more veggies and fruit. Don't like veggies and fruit? Eat them anyway. Eat more protein. Learn to love it and your body and mind will reward you. Potatoes are inexpensive good food for example. \n\n5. Supplement. This is different for everyone. I'm always playing with this and changing it up. I always try to take a multivitamin and  omega supplements. Because I can't afford to eat like a king nor do I have time. \n\n6. Take up some hobbies that get you involved with other people, preferably members of your own gender. If youre a man with anxiety, you probably could benefit from learning more about actually being a man. This was a recent wake up call for me to grow up. \n\n7. If youre a single or married man, learn to up your game in general. Read books about relating to women. It will improve your marriage. If you're single, it will improve your relationships with women. If you're a woman, I don't know the best approach for you in this category. \n\n8. Save money. Be careful with your money. Make a plan for what you will do with your saved money. Your life might be boring because you don't know where you're really going. This was my issue. Once I had solid plans for what I wanted to do as I grew older, every aspect of my life improved. Quit spending so much money on stuff that gives you instant gratification. Bank it instead and prepare your hail Mary. \n\n9. Meditate. Set aside time each day for your mind to think about nothing. Just sit there and breathe. Let your mind do the rest. 10 minutes is enough but do what is practical for you. \n\n10. Quit spending so much time on the Internet. The Internet has all your answers I'm sure. But only in words. You must act to see results.",

            "selftext": "At a neuronal level, what do you think is going on with people who experience anxiety? I have suffered from anxiety for as long as I can remember. For the past year and a half I've been on the SSRI fluoxetine. I noticed a slight effect for a long time, then a much larger positive effect after upping my dose. Eventually my anxiety almost completely disappeared. I became accustomed to feeling pretty much like a normal person should and figured it had been me who had matured, and that the drugs were just a boost in the right direction but were now incidental. I no longer felt the need or the desire to keep taking three small capsules every morning. So a couple months ago I decided to come off the fluoxetine. Much like how my progression to feeling normal was a slow process, my emotional state has steadily been declining since I came off. It's different to how it was before, because pre-antidepressants that persistent feeling of anxiety and dread was the only feeling that I knew. That was my baseline. I figured that was how everyone felt. Now as I feel myself slowly slipping back into this familiar mindset I realise that this feeling of impending doom that I am constantly experiencing is being created by some neuronal process in my brain. I know for a fact that it is artificial but still I cannot overcome it with will power. The well-reasoning part of my brain (which is slowly losing its power to the emotions of dread and anxiety re-colonising my brain) is screaming at me that this is not right. There is no way that a human being should feel like this simply by existing. Okay, now I don't even remember why I started writing this post. Oh yeah, so neurologically, what is it that separates 'normal' people from those with anxiety disorders? I guess my point was that now that I've been on both sides it has become clearer that, in general, the world does not change, only your perception of the world changes. It's not the experiences you have, but how you view them that gives them meaning. Notice how I said 'how you view them,' not 'how you decide to view them.' I've realised that although you may have some small notion of free will when it comes your judgement of experiences, you are programmed (biologically and through your upbringing) to respond emotionally in a certain way to an experience. This deep-seated emotion (anger, fear, dread) then affects behaviour, which in turn affects emotion again in a feedback loop.\n\nMy thoughts are scattered and I don't know where I'm going with this so I'm going to stop writing now, but I'd like to hear what others are thinking.",

In fact, it wasn't too long ago I was so anxious that I couldn't have a friend over because of randomly generated agoraphobia. I was terrified up to it... I couldn't even eat. I had it written down but improvised a bit, got a lot of laughs,  etc. \n\n\nI just wanted to say if I can do *that*, you all can do anything. I was so relieved to just be over.

The first time it happened, I thought I was dying and sent myself to the ER, wore a 48 hour halter monitor, only to have my results come back normal. I'm 23 now and since my anxiety is so bad and I was an alcoholic up until a few months ago, I got them very frequently. In fact it's hard to tell at this point if I get them because of anxiety or if I get anxiety because of them.\n\nEvery single day, up until tonight I lived in fear of something doctors, friends and family told me was very common and nothing to worry about. I refused to exercise, eat too much, and basically engage with my life on any significant level out of fear of producing palpitations.\n\nBut I just found this article that explains not just what causes them, but why they happen on a biological and physiological level. NOTHING has ever managed to set my mind at ease like this; from snooping on here I've noticed a lot of you have anxiety about them and I urge you to read this: [http://www.nomorepanic.co.uk/articles/palpitations](http://www.nomorepanic.co.uk/articles/palpitations)",

            "selftext": "So long story short, my dad passed away 2 years ago in a sudden way, and I was left a bit traumatised by the event. \n\nSaw a therapist to deal with PTSD and uncontrollable \"flashbacks\" and such and that helped, then fast forward to early this year and it starts to become apparent that every time I get anxious my stomach cramps up severely and I have to run to the bathroom, and then this repeats every 20 minutes or so until I'm empty.\n\nStarted seeing the therapist again and we've been working through what seems like complicated bereavement. The anxiety attacks have lessened as well as the stomach cramps and bowel irritability, though it's still there.\n\nBut now over the past 2 months something new and a bit worse has cropped up. Every few weeks I wake up in the early morning with severe diarrhea and usually throw up. Once it's over I'm fine and can eat as usual. It's happened 4 times now and my therapist tells me it won't last forever and it's due to the complicated grief, but honestly I'm just so tired, man. \n\nLike honestly it's just making me feel like a damaged piece of shit, and I don't know, I just want someone to tell me they've experienced the same or similar and reassure me it will get better...because right now it seems like it won't :(\n\n**Edit: Thanks for the advice and kinds words, everyone. I very much appreciate it. It really does help to know that I'm not alone in this mess.**\n\n**To clarify a few questions that have turned up. I'm 26 year old male, 75kg and 5\"10. Diet is mostly chicken, vegetables and whole foods, and I usually eat the same meal every day. I do some strength training 3 times a week. I don't think the issues are diet-related though since as I said I eat the same food daily, but this morning-nausea problem is fairly new (from 2 months ago onwards) and happens once every 1-3 weeks it seems now**\n\n**My therapist is confident it's all related to anxiety and my mind. He is likely correct, I believe. Last time I had an \"episode\" was after a bad week where my girlfriend broke up with me, it was my dad's birthday and soon after the 2 year anniversary of his death...So it was a shit week. Then this episode had me upset and anxious a few days back with comments a colleague made that left me consumed with anger for a whole day, then a lot of family frustration the night before it happened.**\n\n**So I mean, if it's IBS related, I do think it's mind related and not diet specific. I hope that makes sense. I guess I need short term ways to manage this while the long term solution (i.e. continuous therapy) takes its course**\n",

            "selftext": "Edit:  Whew!! I'm sorry this is so long!! \n\nSo I just realized this today...but it had been a while since I was on this sub (I'm sorry, I still love and support you all)...the correlation was I left a job where I was at my boiling point. (After writing this all out, it feels a bit clich\u00e9 so I apologize but I hope it helps someone!)\n\nThis job was a terrible night schedule in which I was not able to have a social life, I dealt with awful customers daily and by the end of the day, I was completely emotionally and mentally drained. I spent Friday night worrying about Monday; my weekends were wasted in my mind. My relationship suffered tremendously and I ended up going to the doctor and a counselor for my anxiety as I was scared it was turning into depression. To sum it up, spending 40 hours in a toxic environment can be devastating both mentally and emotionally. I realized my limits had been pushed so I set out on a job hunt.\n\nI managed to get a job, albeit lower paying, and was so excited about it. I had a panic attack on the 5th day and left. I got another job within 2 weeks where a co-worker told a story that fell into 'sexual harassment'. Left day 1. I was feeling *so* down, as up until this point I had not been unemployed in years and it was very out of character for me. I had never gone into an interview where I had to say \"I am jobless\". I was so far out of my comfort zone. I cried to my SO telling him how sorry I was to put this burden on him, but he is my rock and I attribute all of my motivation to him.\n\nBeing unemployed with anxiety was a new and strange beast for me. At one point, there were just so many worries financially that I completely broke down and slept for about 3 days and finally I just snapped and said \"Fuck the world, I'm finding a fucking job\" (easier said than done). I buckled down and promised myself I wouldn't accept anything less than what I am worth. While this was expending a ton of my energy, I couldn't continue to watch my SO work 80 hour weeks while I sat pantless all day on Reddit. I sent my resum\u00e9 to dozens of people in higher up positions that I respected and got lots of feedback. I cruised Indeed, Craigslist, ANYTHING for about 3 weeks. Then I started reaching out to people and my luck changed.\n\nI finally had an interview with a FANTASTIC company in a great position. It took about a month for this job to get back to me. All other jobs looked so pale in comparison; I had my heart set on it. Never mind sitting and picking apart literally *everything* I said during the interview- every day I sat refreshing my e-mail, watching my phone and my anxiety was absolutely off the charts. They set timelines which were not met and while I want to say I sat waiting patiently, I couldn't. I finally reached out to them after 2.5 weeks and basically just asked if I was still being considered. To my surprise, I was. (relief). About a week later, I got a call with the job. I literally had dreams about this moment. I quickly called and cancelled 3 other interviews I had lined up in the next 2 weeks. It is not customer-related at all and while I still have a few days of freedom to go, I am so excited to feel like I'm worth something again.\n\n**All in all of my experience:** When looking for jobs while employed, everyone continued saying, \"Make sure you have a job lined up before you go onto the next one!\" and while I do agree with that- everything is a chance and sometimes that chance is worth your mental well-being. Had I saved the funds properly, I would have left far earlier than I did. You could have a job lined up and have that one fall through and fall flat on your face again, like I did. Or you could move on and flourish. \n\n*No job is worth your health.* Do not be afraid to take those chances- but be smart about it. The only advice I have if you are in a similar situation is to have money to last you for a few months. Continue through to make sure that you will not have financial burdens while job hunting as that is where most of my anxiety has (and still) lies. I hope that this next job doesn't cause too much anxiety and I hope this was able to help someone. If you've read this far- thanks for reading :) xx\n\n**TL;DR:** Left job that induced anxiety daily, fell flat on my face after 2 failed jobs and finally have a new one in which I had my heart set on and fingers crossed will be minimal anxiety.",

Every time I try to start I get overwhelmed and ignore it instead. \n\nI clean up garbage and stuff so it's not anywhere near hoarding levels. It's more that I have a ton of random crap that I don't know what to do with so it ends up just sitting in one spot and living there. I know there's tons of advice on clutter/organizing and all that.. and I know I could use it.\n\nThe problem is that I have an all-or-nothing attitude that makes breaking large things down into manageable chunks very hard. \n\nSo instead of being a reasonable adult and maintaining a clean environment by doing like.. 20 mins of work a day... I'll avoid it for half a year, spend an entire day deep cleaning until there's not a spec of dust anywhere.. and then rinse and repeat 5-6 months later.\n\nThis also doesn't really organize things either. Stuff just gets migrated into either a box, some shelf, or somewhere else. Just glancing right now I see: a tube of fish food for the goldfish I have not had for over 4 months, a heating pad from when I hurt my knee, a roll of paper towel, a relaxation cassette tap from the 80's, a tape measure, 3 cans of condensed air for cleaning computers (actually relevant and useful, but somehow I ended up using all 3 at once so now I have 3 of them), a CD with drivers for the Dell computer we had 10 years ago, a photo album that somehow ended up living next to the compressed air cans... you get the picture.\n\nLogically, I know what to do to clean up.. just start SOMEWHERE. I just hate the idea that I'll probably do what I always do and just shuffle everything around or stick random crap in boxes. \n\nPlease tell me others deal with this bullcrap. It's an eyesore, it stresses me out, and it makes me feel so incredibly stupid because it's NOT ROCKET SCIENCE on how to fix the problem...\n\nBut somehow I still end up taking one look and thinking I'll start on it in an hour.\n\nI decided to set aside 20 mins a day at a specified time to force myself to just start on it.. because otherwise I just keep avoiding it until I snap and clean everything in a 5-6 hour time span. \n\nWhat is silly is that I have pet birds and I have no problem cleaning their cage weekly and doing all the daily maintenance required.. it's just when it's random crap that somehow my brain chemistry malfunctions and I suddenly don't know what to do with anything.",

I just wanted to update everyone that gave me advice, and give a huge thanks to everyone that responded. I was surprised by how many people gave me advice/support on this and it helped a lot, so thank you!\n\nSo, the TLDR of my post was basically I got mixed signals from a girl (named G in my post) who I was into and it was giving me some nasty ass anxiety. I took more or less the average of all the advice that I was given, and realized I was being clingy as fuck. I decided that I wasn't gonna totally stop talking to G, but since I still don't know what the fuck G wants I'm just going the \"just friends\" route. Once I got my shit figured out my anxiety dialed back and I started feeling better. We've hung out a few times since then, she invited me to lunch once this week, and we have plans to hang out next weekend. \n\nI also said that there was a German quiz on top of everything else that had me anxious. I studied for like four hours for that quiz, and it turned out to be fucking three multiple choice questions. Aced that shit. \n\nAnyway, I just want to thank everyone again that came forward with advice, it helped me a lot and I am going to go talk to the help on campus about anxiety some time this week, because I didn't have time last week.

            "selftext": "Hey guys so some back story to this,\n\nDuring primary school everyone would mistreat me, no matter how much I cared or respected a friend, I was always that.. 'Friend' the annoying one, or the one everyone excluded. I never really new why. Everyone just happened to treat me like that.\n\n\nFast forward to high school I finally had manage to get a group of friends, there was about 8 of us, we were little trouble making boys, and then one day I went to school and all of them hated me, they all started talking shit randomly. All because one of them spreaded a rumour about me and the whole group sheeped him. He said shit like I was using them, I stole his girls, said so many things. Of course everything he said about me was made up.\n\n\nSoon after everyone, everyone in my year level knew about it and I had no one to hang with, and even though it's been 4 years now since that happened, everytime someone gets a little angry at me or when my friends joke with me on Facebook posts (saying insulting jokes)  and random people like their comments i auto assume the person who likes their comment hates me. And they're spreading shit about me. \n\n\nOr when someone tells me that 'this person' was talking trash about me, I assume that person had told a heap of people and their group hates me.\n\n\nI don't know how to stop assuming that everyone hates me once one person does.. How should I come about this problem? Usually when I hear something like that I get kinda angry and it ruins my whole day.. thoughts like what did I ever do to you? :( \n\ntl;dr \nI assume people hate me over the smallest things, and that once a person talks shit about me, I assume everyone who they tell will hate me as well. Very paranoid about that. Idk what to do to diffuse my feelings towards people talking trash about me ",

            "selftext": "I've had bad anxiety since high school. I used to be too anxious to get out of bed, I missed so much school I had to do make up days just to get credit for my classes. I had the same issue, only worse, in college. I ended up dropping out because I was just wasting loan money and failing. \n\nI now have an apartment and I'm finally supporting myself. I'm happier than ever and I have a fairly easy and enjoyable job, but I just found out I'm going to be laid off for budget reasons. I have one week. \n\nI've lost other jobs due to my attendance issue also, and this is the first job I've ever been successful with. I just had one of the worse panic attacks I've ever had when I found out about the lay off. I grew up very poor and in an unstable household, and the idea of not being able to support myself is terrifying. I finally have security. I can pay my rent and bills on time. I can eat when I'm hungry. and now I'm losing that.\n\nI've been job hunting online all night and I keep having to stop and breath for a moment so I won't panic again. Every job I find sounds daunting in relative to my anxiety. I feel like such a failure that I can't do simple minimum wage jobs. I know I'm strong and competent, but sometimes I just can't do it and I hate myself for it. \n\nI can't apply for disability because my anxiety hasn't even been diagnosed yet. Even if it was, disability where I live required that your anxiety must have been preventing you from working for the last 12 months (what the hell? If I hadn't been working for the past 12 months, why would I suddenly need money to survive now?).\n\nWhat do I do? I'm absolutely desperate and panicking. I really don't want to get on daily anxiety medication, I've seen what that does to people.",
