Breathing that makes your chest move and breathing that makes your stomach move. The one we want is the stomach breathing.\n\nTo learn how to do this, put one hand on your chest and one hand on your stomach. Now, try to breathe in a way that your chest doesn't move, but only your stomach moves in and out. You might notice that your breathing feels deeper than normal. This is what we want.\n\n(Obviously you don't need to have your hand on your stomach, this is just how you might learn.)\n\nDo this deep stomach breathing. It reduces anxiety because it lets you take in more air than normal. You can breathe like this 24/7 if you want. Practice it a few times a day at least. \n\nI hope this helps you.",

I called it 'being shy' back in the day.. I hated knocking on doors, I got 'performance anxiety' with figuring out what I was supposed to say, when I should say it, and so on. All these strangers doors...\n\nThen at some point, one mean adult ruined Halloween for me, by snidely remarking that I was too old. After that, I stayed home, alone.\n\nI wasn't a popular kid, never really got invited to parties or anything.. and being an only child with parents that worked during the day, I was often sitting at home alone as the sun set, and the youngest Trick-or-treaters started traversing the neighborhood with their parents.\n\nThey'd ring the doorbell, and I'd freeze up. My parents expected me to get on the 'giving out candy' bandwagon.. but I started freaking out. Usually my Mom would come home relatively early, and then once she was home, I was free to just hide in the livingroom.\n\nFor a while, I was involved in some Star Trek clubs (RL) and we usually had a little get-together, so I often found someplace else to be. Then shortly after, I moved to a little town in Oregon.\n\nUp here, it rains a lot. And so the trick-or-treaters aren't too common. In fact, there have been years where we've bought candy, only to have no one even knock... but still, I've hidden in my room, or gone to a friend's house to avoid the door responsibility.\n\nAnd still, my heart jumps into my throat when the doorbell rings.\n\nThis year, I've moved in with the friend-I-used-to-go-over-to's-house.. so there's noplace for me to go and hide.\n\nHe's bought candy. He's decorated our little apartment window.

            "selftext": "Pardon the rant. You may recognize yourself here:\n\nI've reached the point where I literally have no idea what's going on. I don't remember my past, my appointments, my plans. I've begun canceling everything and avoid people at all costs rather than deal with the three days of horrific anticipation before I so much as go out for a drink.\n\nThis situation led me to see doctors. Bood tests, cognitive tests, the works. The consensus? I have all the symptoms of dementia but not dementia. It's probably just stress! Oh, great. I've been seeing a therapist for that for years. Not much has changed.\n\nIt's terrifying. I can't function. And people are very quick with advice. \"You just need a system to remember things\" or \"put it in your phone\" or \"hey, don't worry, I'm the same way!\" They have no idea how bad it is.\n\nThe 'put it in your phone' is a classic example. If I put something in my phone I then spend days freaking out over anticipating the reminder. I'll forget about it for a few minutes and then panic and think \"oh shit what's the thing I'm supposed to do!\" My entire life becomes about not missing the fucking reminder.\n\nIt's now reached the point where I voluntarily walk the dogs, go to the store, and nothing else. We're theater buffs in a great city for it, and I was going to lots of plays and so on, going out with friends, etc. Now I'm canceling everything I can. My wife of course is out of patience. I keep telling her to go with somebody else. Anybody else.\n\nNot looking for advice or anything. I know what needs to be done -- so far I haven't been medicated for it but that is going to change. Just wanted to rant a few minutes. Anybody else falling into the memory hole?\n\n\nEDIT: thanks for the replies. Now on 50mg Prozac daily. It's helping!",

I require too much coddling in order to feel like I'm doing a good job. Every day at work, I'm just silently wishing someone could compliment my work ethic or output. Unfortunately, if that were to happen, I would get so self conscious that my work output would suffer because I get so worried about the quality of my reports. \n\nI want a hug but I know that receiving and asking for one are both extremely unprofessional. Some people do hug in the office, but I'm supposed to be the prodigy. I'm supposed to be the one worker that can do what they are required to unprompted and in great quality. I'm the kid that was offered a Case Management position without the industry standard of a Master's degree because I was impressive.

Just recently, I have discovered my sexual orientation and not much sooner than that, I realized I was transgender.\n\nAfter coming out as a transgender woman, I have noticed my social anxiety has decreased dramatically and my general anxiety is almost nonexistent. My mild depression also doesn't happen on the days I truly feel like a woman.\n\n Because I realized my true identity, my anxieties and depression has lowered and some days, I don't even feel them! And I barely started my transition. I'm pre-HRT and have modified my appearance to look more feminine.\n\nI just want to say, thank you /r/Anxiety for all the help you have given me.

            "selftext": "Some people are genetically predisposed to anxiety, some struggle because of stressful circumstances, and for some, physical conditions play a role.\n\nBut this isn\u2019t a post about what causes anxiety. This is a post about what not to say when someone\u2019s panicking.\n\nAnxiety can completely overwhelm your mind and body, and we often exacerbate our pain by being cruel to ourselves in our head.\n\n\u201cGet it together!\u201d we scream at ourselves. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with you? Why are you such a mess?\u201d\n\nBut none of these thoughts are helpful. Though the people who love us are generally not as cruel, they sometimes say less than helpful things, as well, solely because they don\u2019t know any better.\n\nEven as someone who has experienced anxiety, I have said some of the things below to others because it feels powerless to see someone struggling. And when you feel powerless, it\u2019s hard to think straight.\n\nAll you know is that you want to fix it for them. You want to have answers. But sometimes when we\u2019re in fix-it mode, despite our best intentions, we inadvertently add fuel to the fire.\n\nSo, as someone who\u2019s been on both sides of the coin, I\u2019d like to share some phrases to avoid when someone is dealing with anxiety, and offer a little insight into what actually helps.\n\nFirst\n\nWhat you\u2019re stressing about won\u2019t even matter in a year.\n\nIn many cases, this is true. If someone\u2019s worrying about a minor car accident, it\u2019s entirely likely what they\u2019re stressing about won\u2019t really matter in the grand scheme of things. But this isn\u2019t a universally true statement.\n\nA minor accident could lead to major car trouble, which could lead to missing work, which could lead to lost pay, which could lead to getting evicted. And that could very well matter in a year. Is this chain of events likely? No, but it\u2019s still possible.\n\nIt\u2019s not reassuring to tell someone the worst-case scenario won\u2019t happen because sometimes, it does. But more importantly, in that moment when someone is in the midst of anxiety, it feels catastrophic, and you can\u2019t rationalize those feelings away\u2014at least not immediately.\n\nWhen someone is panicking, they don\u2019t need logic; they need validation. They need validation that yes, life is uncertain and \u201cbad\u201d things do happen, and validation that it\u2019s okay to feel scared\n\nSecond\n\nLife\u2019s too short to worry.\n\nAll this does is create more anxiety, because in addition to whatever that person was initially stressing about, they now have to worry that they\u2019re missing out on life because of an emotional response that feels beyond their control.\n\nYes, life is short. And we all naturally want to make the most of it. But you wouldn\u2019t tell a diabetic \u201cLife is too short to have too much sugar in your blood.\u201d Sure, you\u2019d encourage them to make healthy food choices, but you\u2019d realize this phrasing would vastly oversimplify the effort required from them to manage their condition and maintain healthy habits.\n\nThe same is true of anxiety. Anyone who\u2019s struggled with it understands there are far better ways to live, and this knowledge pains them. What they may not know is how to help themselves.\n\nThird\n\n\u201cCalm down\u201d is the goal, not the action step. It\u2019s what we all want to do when we\u2019re panicking. It\u2019s the shore in the distance, and it can feel miles away as we gasp for air in the undertow of emotion and struggle to stay afloat.\n\nIf you know any good methods that help you calm yourself\u2014deep breathing exercises, for example\u2014by all means, share them. But it\u2019s probably best not to get into much detail in the moment when someone is panicking.\n\nImagine someone hanging off a cliff, about to fall into a pit full of tigers. That\u2019s what anxiety can feel like.\n\nIf you were to stand at the edge and scream, \u201cCOME TO YOGA WITH ME TOMORROW! DID YOU KNOW THAT YOGA CAN HELP YOU\u2026\u201d that person would likely be too consumed by their terror to hear you your convincing argument.\n\nWhat they need to hear in that moment is \u201cTake my hand!\u201d And the same is true of anxiety. Hold their hand. Help them breathe. Help them come back into the moment. Then, when they feel safe, that\u2019s a good time to tell them what\u2019s helped you.\n\nThat\u2019s another important thing to remember: We all want to hear what\u2019s helped other people deal, not what someone who\u2019s never experienced our struggles has read about. Share your experience, not your expertise. None of us need a guru; we need friends who aren\u2019t afraid to be vulnerable.\n\nWho Agree with me ??",
