            "selftext": "I have this big problem where I randomly get anxiety with no clear triggers (likely not the only one) and it causes me to not do any work since my body refuses to do anything. This delay of work causes me to worry about not getting it done and then I get anxious about it sitting around which then makes the problem worse. Eventually I just end up not doing it which hurts my grades and career which then makes my anxiety worse. I now have so much regret and just want to reset my life, but I know that's not how it works.\n\nI'm sure I'm not the only one with this problem so this is honestly more of a rant than anything. My doctor doesn't want to give me any medication even though I have tried all his other techniques. \"Luckily\" I've had hives these last few weeks due to the anxiety and I now have a meeting with my doctor tomorrow to discuss options so maybe I can finally get my life on track.\n\nSorry for the long an unnecessary post, but I'm really hoping someone here relates and can help.\n\nI apologize too much. Sorry.\n\nEdit: Since a lot people have seen this, I just want to say thank you to everyone who has commented and shared with me. While I am sorry you deal with it, too, I am glad I am not alone in this. Not sure if anyone cares, but I just got off the phone with my doctor and he is finally giving me something so I am unbelievably happy. Thanks again, everyone.",

I do what I have to but it is becoming that I am not able to handle the minimum.  \n\nI feel broken, and weak.  I am having trouble collecting my thoughts as i write this.   \n\nI am getting emails rignt now i thought you were going to get me that quote.  it is an easy quote should take me 2 hours to get it out but i can't and I don't know why.  i  don't even have an excuse as to why.\n\nI don't know what is happening.  I don't know if it can be fixed either.   \n\n/Edit:  Thank you for the responses, this morning I was having a panic attack, my first one.  Being almost 40 and trying to keep my depression at bay on my own has caught up with me.  I decided to try medication and therapy, the medication amplified my emotions quicker than I anticipated.  I was able to take the rest of the week off, and go see the mental health nurse today.  Now I feel normal, and looking back I wonder if I over reacted.  I almost expected to identify feelings that were induced by the drug and regular feelings.  Venting here really helped me calm down, Thank you!\n\n\n//Edit2: I want to say I have read and reread all of your comments, Thank You.  It really helped to hear from you yesterday.  ",

The other person is his girlfriend who moved in about 6 months ago.\n  \n\n\nHer and I had never really talked before, apart from casual passing hi's and goodbye's/how's it goin'. However, tonight I walked into the kitchen after a couple of beers, and she was making dinner. I bravely queried about her night out with my mate last Friday night, and she responded positively and eagerly, sharing her experience. She then followed up by asking about my Uni life, which I - emboldened by the liquid courage - shared my progress, hopes, fears and doubts. She responded so encouragingly and genuinely interested, I felt so elated and confident. I offered to show her (and my friend) the recordings I'd performed/created (I study Audio Engineering) the past 6 months, and she was very supportive and curious. After a bid goodnight we returned to our respective rooms.\n\n\n\nI sat in my chair grinning ear to ear, hugging myself. Man it felt good to have a perfect conversation with someone that ended on a good note. I hope to have more of these more in the future!\n\nJust thought I'd share. Thanks for reading :)",

Typically i try to shut down the conversation and move it to something else, or make an excuse to leave the situation ASAP. \n\nFor example, it's almost my birthday and people keep asking my what I want as a gift or how I want to celebrate it. For some reason I just can't bring myself to think of anything I'd want for myself,  and even if I did I'm pretty sure I could never bring myself to tell anyone about it. It's only a few weeks away and I'm terrified that Im going to start weeping if my girlfriend asks me again what I want to do. \n\nThis is a problem in other aspects of my life including sex, food, dreams/ambitions, work life balance, mental health, hell it took me weeks before I could even bring myself to post something here about it... I end up feeling selfish and panic-y as soon as my needs are brought up. \n\nI was talking with a therapist at the beginning of the year,  but stopped because I felt stupid, selfish, and guilty talking about my problems. I am currently trying to bring myself to make the call to set up a new appointment,  but I don't know if i can handle that right now. \n\nFor the most part I feel like I'm pretty decent at managing my anxiety,  but this is a roadblock I really struggle with. Does anyone else have freak outs the minute you start considering your own needs and wants? Any advice for overcoming this? ",

            "selftext": "Wrote this last night. For some reason I was having mental breakthroughs and felt compelled to write them down. And post it in spite of the great anxiety doing so gives me (fear of negative evaluation and all that).\n\nAt some point you realize that it's more than just shyness. Intimacy provokes fear/anxiety, anxiety provokes avoidance. So you don't learn the right social skills because you don't put yourself in social situations. And as you get older, and you realize how important society and social interaction is, it just suddenly dawns on you just how stunted you are - people spent years and years honing these skills from elementary school to high school, while you spent those years hiding in fear, fortifying the iron bars of introversion you caged yourself in. You try to take the mask off, to break free of that prison, but you realize you spent so long hiding that you never learned how to act, how to be genuine and \"normal\" around others. The mask is more normal than you are. Like learning a language, the only way to ever be truly fluent is to learn it as a young child. I can gain competency, even working fluency in it, but I'll always be an outsider, an alien stepping into a foreign land and disguising himself as one of its people. My mother tongue will always be different from theirs. Social skills like playing games, sharing secrets, making friends, trust? They were born in it; molded by it. I didn't think about those things until I was already a man, and by then they were nothing to me but distant concepts, buried in the abyss of ancient defense mechanisms and anxious thoughts I call home.\n \nAnd I've been here so long, hiding behind walls of defenses I never even knew existed, I can't even determine what's real, whats true and what's false. I don't trust my own mind anymore. Everything could just be another excuse, another instance where I procrastinate and fail to tackle the real issues. And it makes you feel insane, sometimes, you know? I'm like a victim of self-inflicted solitary confinement. We are social beings by default - we gauge our behavior and moderate our thoughts and beliefs based on those of others. I never had that. I never had the back-and-forth of friendly arguing, the ability to \"normalize\" my thoughts in accordance with others. I never wanted to play with other kids, never wanted to talk to anyone, I just sought the safety of my room after every school day. That portion of my brain that was supposed to be shaped by intimacy, trust, and friendship is instead shaped by fear and avoidance.\n\nThere's more, I posted the rest in r/depression but thought it was a little too much :P. And not something I can TL;DR.",

Basically you go down the list of some of your senses and focus on things one at a time. You find three things you can see, two things you can hear, two things you can feel and so on. You focus on each thing individually, picking out as much detail as you can. In this way your mind is occupied until the attack passes. It's kind of a grounding thing.",

I get separation anxiety when I am separated from a person who is a regular in my life, especially a significant other.  I believe I am far too dependent on the presence of others to keep my anxiety at bay.  I am now on Effexor for anxiety/depression and I take hydroxyzine whenever I feel a surge of anxiety.  I also enjoy recreational drugs occasionally to help with severe cases.  I have an extremely hard time finding soothing activities because when I'm anxious, I can't concentrate on anything and it seems impossible to bring myself down from that.

I was super anxious the first weekish, but after that I'm feeling SIGNIFICANTLY better. My daily anxiety went from about a 5 to a 0, and I haven't had a panic attack since I started to normalize.\n\nSorry if this is inappropriate for this sub, but I just feel like I want to shout this from the rooftops, that weed may be exacerbating your anxiety, not curing it as I once believed.
