Orders are given and in no time it's your turn. Everyones looking. You glance down at the menu. \"Uhmm\". \"Uhmmmmm\". The rooms getting awfully hot and things are getting frantic, someone who knows you well points out that you always have trouble deciding, *thanks for that*. \n\nThe waitress offers to come back later and everybody laughs, oh god no then people are waiting for me to decide. You look down and just blurt out the first thing you see. *Phew*, that was bad. Then you realize you really didn't want that at all, now you're worried about **that**.\n\n**WELL NO MORE**\n\nJust find the menu on one of those review websites, theres usually photos of the food on there as well! This is the future, we can finally take an hour (or more) to decide what we want without the intense fires of hell that is the situation that I described above. This might be a well known thing but I only thought about doing this the other week and it's changed my life.\n\nNow all you need to do is be confident in your decision once you get to the establishment and manage to speak with everyone looking at you. *Also* , asking to \"hold the _____\" or \"but without _____ please\" is still terrifying.",

            "selftext": "Today, I'm in a class of nearly 40 Japanese JHS students, every English teacher in the school and important people from the board of education. The lesson, which is usually made by me, was very poor because Japanese teacher I work with made the plan and I translated it though her (low level) English. Today she was a nervous wreck and I was cool, calm and collected.\n\nI'm an Assistant Language Teacher in Japan. Been here for over a year and a half. I came here as a challenge and to see the world. About seven years ago my psychologist said that I would be exploring big cities like Tokyo one day. Back then I didn't believe her. \n\nAt 18 I was diagnosed with panic attacks, depression and anxiety. The combination of genetics, an abusive parent, poor grades, a shitty job, living in a tiny and remote town and no direction. I managed to only pass high school because we worked out a deal where I sit at the back of the exam room and allowed music. Thinking back now, I can't even imagine what I looked or sounded like.\n\nEventually an incident at 19 got me kicked out of home and into the world. Most people head around the world or into higher learning at this age. Me, I just started working the same shitty job but this time in a new town. Even that proved too much and I ended up on unemployment benefits. Sometimes I had a job but nothing lasted more than 3 months, like any relationship I had.\n\nStayed there with various minor substance abuse issues and other addictions until 25 when I finally got the psychiatric help I needed. I found out how abusive that parent really was, how my thinking could be changed and new paths that I could take to recovery. \n\n26, I moved to the city and by 27 I was traveling the country. At 28 a job fell in my lap and I took it. Teaching students one on one. \n\nI still had my off days at work but my boss was supportive. I managed to work there for two years while I studied for my degree. I was still on benefits but my reliance was becoming less and less as my employment confidence grew.\n\nThen I got a job in Japan, sold everything I had and moved countries. I remember being on the train coming into Tokyo from the airport, \"What my psych said came true. I'm actually doing this!\" When I stepped into my first class it was the worst class in the worst school. That's when I thought \"What the fuck have I done.\" At 18, I would have run away. I wouldn't know how to manage my emotions. All I could think was \"just stay put and focus on the task at hand\".\n\nThat's what I did and I survived. Since then I've had other days like that but I know I can deal with them. Now I'm teaching full classes with relative ease but it took a while for the training wheels to come off.\n\nToday my anxious Japanese teacher was all over the place. Coming up to me and wanting to change the plan. Erratic in her thoughts and actions. I could see why (because she wants to do a good job) but it was unnecessary. Just relaxing and working through what we planned was best. I look at her and see my old self. I respond to her in a calm voice and tell her that it's okay, everything is under control. I'm responding to my old self as my new self.\n\nThe class went fairly terribly but after in the meeting I stayed relaxed. I spoke when I felt it necessary and didn't take anything personally.\n \nDuring and after the class I had a few moments of zen. Realizing how far I had come and how hard I've worked at controlling my emotions. If my 18 year old self was told what I was doing now he would never believe it.\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nI must say that I have little reason to come to this sub now. I try to look to the future instead of my past. That said, I hope that my story can inspire others. I have been long term unemployed, on the brink of homelessness, had breakdowns, throw out of share houses, failed subjects, been addicted and isolated myself. Somehow I made it through and each little success (now matter how small) built me into who I am today. I'm still learning but today warranted some reflection.\n\nTL:DR - Used to have crippling anxiety and now I don't so much.  ",

            "selftext": "Hi everyone, \n\nWhile I may appear like I am a functioning human being, the reality is that I need a ton of alone time to get by. I work 40 hours a week, and in the evenings I barely ever make plans because I need time afterwards to decompress, as work is extremely stressful. When the weekend finally comes I spend at least a full day recovering in my apartment [resting, cleaning, cooking, watching Netflix, whatever]. Sometimes for the whole weekend, the only time I'll go out is for groceries out of necessity. I'm anxious all the time and feel like I don't have enough free time. I feel I'm on the edge of major burn out. I'd stay in more if I could. \n\nI recognize that a 40 hour job isn't that much on my plate. I'm lucky I don't also go to school, work a second job, or have a demanding family. Instead I'm alone, single, and don't really have friends, because keeping up a social life just sounds exhausting. I don't want to live like this forever. I want to do more. \n\nDoes anyone else relate to this?",

She was so young, we barely even have shit figured out in our lives and she's fucking gone. What the fuck. \n\nI remember hiding in her closet playing pokemon together, I remember running around the outside of her house making up stories and fantasy worlds, I remember having christmas at my house and her and I feverishly talking about what we got in my room, I remember our sleepovers together and how we would try to stay up past midnight, I remember how we joined the chess club together in elementary school so we could hang out together even more.

When I read her post I just broke down and cried for hours. \n\nI have never seen anyone post something like that before and it hit me hard. I found I wanted to thank her so much for that simple post but didn't know how. Outside of professionals I have only ever been able to talk to one friend about my anxiety and the thought of actually letting her know was too much. Eventually I thought about a different situation where my counselor suggested I write a letter to a someone about how I felt even if I never give it to that person it could help me process my thoughts.\n\nSo I sat down and wrote a thank you note. After I got done I still had the strong desire to let her know, and I somehow decided the best way to get her the card I had wrote would be to send it with some flowers. So I went to a local florist and picked a small bouquet of flowers out, had them attach my card and paid them to deliver it all to her work. \n\nUp until I was leaving the florist I don't think I ever actually thought about what I was doing I was on autopilot and doing it because it felt right, but as soon as I walked out my anxiety caught up with me and I started freaking out about what I had just done. What if the florist delivery person had my name on their delivery paperwork and told her who they were from, what if she somehow figured out who had sent them some other way, what if she didn't like them or thought it was weird getting flowers anonymously. My heart was racing for pretty much constantly and I was always checking Facebook to see if she had posted anything. \n\nWhen she finally posted a picture of the flowers on Facebook it was probably the biggest moment of relief and happiness I have felt it a long time. She said thank you to whoever gave her the flowers, that she felt 'blessed' and that she was always there. \n\nI don't think I have felt this good about anything I have done in a long time and I just felt like I needed to share it with everyone. I still can't believe I did what I did without overthinking everything like I normally do and that it turned out so well. \n\nI know this was a long post, so if you made it this far, thank you.\n\n********\nEDIT: I want to thank everyone for their responses. I know this meant a lot to me, but I never expected this type of a response from everyone. So here are the flowers to hopefully add a little cheer to everyone's day: http://imgur.com/a/6L0Ek",

Being anxious makes us over think these things. \n\nIf you can help it, don't identify with your anxiety. Face it, and accept that it is there, but don't let it become who you are.",

Never wanted to go to bed because I didn't want tomorrow to happen.\n\n\nHated my weekends because I knew I'd never get the mental rest I needed, and they'd just fly by anyway.\n\n\nDidn't have enough time or energy after work to engage in any of my hobbies or personal projects, or give my sick dog the attention he needed.\n\n\nBut when I was laid off, I was relieved. Relieved I had that freedom back to dedicate all my time towards my responsibilities and not feel overwhelmed. \n\n\nI can't continue to live like this, however  (not earning any income). Although I feel really passionate and proud of the mobile application I've spent 3 months working on while unemployed, I have to sacrifice that joy and passion for another mind numbing, demotivating, soul crushing full time job for some corporation. \n\n\nI don't think I'm cut out for this world because I can't handle a job like everyone else. I get burned out and overstimulated too easily. \n\n\nYou can't survive and support yourself without money. Guys, I'm not lazy. My work ethic is great. Even at my last position, I outperformed in most of my tasks. But that didn't stop me from thinking about jumping on the tracks during my commute everyday. I'm not suicidal, but I'd rather die than continue living this way. \n\n\nI spoke about this with my psychologist, and I'm not sure if she understands the extent of what I'm going through. \n\n\nThere is statement on the submission page that says \"Breathe Deep ~ It's gonna be ok &lt;3\" but it does not feel that way at all.

            "selftext": "I've been reading a lot about meditation and how to cope with anxiety. But one thing that I've been having trouble with is the idea that \"the key to letting go of your thoughts is to acknowledge that they can't hurt you\".   \nHow do I do this without abandoning my problems? I have no money, I've been forced to move back in with my mum. I haven't had a job in over a year, Christmas is coming up and my suicidal thoughts have been getting increasingly stronger and it scares me.  \n\nOnly one of those things are in my head. Letting go of my anxiety of these problems feels like I'm pretending they aren't problems. I'm stuck between wanting to give up so bad and to just \"let go\", and knowing that I still have this giant mess that needs cleaning up or else it becomes someone else's problem. I feel pathetic complaining but these things are real for me.  \n\n\nI would love to get a job, I've been trying so hard, but the anxiety of working makes it hard to even look for work at times.  \nI would love to move out again, but nobody wants to rent to someone on taxpayers' money.  \nI would love to buy my family nice gifts for Christmas but I'm so pathetic that I can't even take care of myself.  \n\n\nHow am I supposed to let go when the idea of pretending everything is okay seems so self-destructive. I've tried it before, I ended up quitting my job and moving out with friends. It only made my life even worse as it has now come back around to bite me on the ass.   \n\n\nHonestly, I'd love nothing more than to simply let go and let my life go its course as my whole world crashes down around me. I'd love to just go batshit crazy and end up in a hospital where nobody cares if you don't have a job or stable home. But doing so would cost those around me. The other option would be to kill myself but I'm afraid that people I love would follow me. I'm stuck in this prison of a life, forced to work to pay for a life that I don't even want to live. How the fuck am I supposed to let that go? How do you tell yourself that nothing can hurt you when you are already in so much pain?   \n\n\nMaybe I've just forgotten how to live without anxiety. Sometimes I think anxiety is the only thing stopping my depression from taking over. Maybe my \"fight or flight\" is actually working to keep me alive, but torturing me in the process. Tell me what's worth more, a peaceful mind with no will to live, or an anxious mind that's too scared to live or die?\n",
