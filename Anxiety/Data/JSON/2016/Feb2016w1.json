It's not even that big of an assignment - worth 5% of the overall grade - and the professor basically implied it was free marks. However, the thought of working on it makes me so anxious I feel physically uncomfortable. The past couple of weeks I have just completely put it out of my mind and told myself \"I'll start tomorrow\", but now I've run out of time to procrastinate. \n\n\nLast semester, I just didn't do papers/assignments/exams that gave me anxiety, and I ended up failing a class and landing myself on academic probation. As I am writing I just keep having doubts like maybe I'm doing it wrong, misinterpreting the assignment, going to accidentally plagiarize, the professor is going to think its stupid, I'll get a zero, etc. Eventually my fear of failure leads to me abandoning the project.\n\n\nAm I alone in this? If anybody has experienced something similar, do you have any advice for me? ",

I have 4 months left of funding on my PhD which will take 6 months to complete if I didn't have an anxiety disorder. Worst of all a very close friend of mine killed himself three weeks ago (funeral was Friday). This led me to take a cocktail of drugs and alcohol to try and cope, but when I asked my friends for help they ignored me and haven't spoke to me since.sincerely \nI just don't feel like I can keep myself safe. I have attempted suicide a few time before. I have meeting with psych nurse tomorrow, but every second is a struggle. I just need a way out. I'm sorry.\n\n\nEDIT. I'm home now. Not feeling great but have taken my prescription diazepam and feel a little less on edge.  I dont know how I can fix this but I'd like to thank you for your concern. If anyone would like to pm me I'd appreciate it as it will keep me busy until my appointment. ",

These past few weeks I was spiralling downward feeling worse and worse, and on the verge of having no hope. I would cry every night, shake from panic at placement, insomnia, nightmares, puffy eyes. I felt like I was dying. I saw your post, found the one magnesium tab in the back of my mom's  cupboard, drank it down and: the relief was unimaginable. I'm now the proud owner of a tub of magnesium powder, and continue to feel more amazing each day since. Thanks for thinking to share, it changed my health 180 degrees.\n\nEdit: hi everyone! I have a lot of responses asking what and how much I've taken. I just wanted to post to remind everyone that medical advice over the internet is good, but should be always taken with a grain of salt! If you think you have low magnesium, but are taking lots of medications or are just unsure how much or what kind to take- please please call your doctor. They know your situation, and can give the best advice. Everything you take (vitamins, meds, even just water) has an effect on the body, and can be helpful or harmful so it's best to consult a professional about interactions or side effects. Treat supplaments (even though they're 'natural' like medications, because they can and will interact with meds, and have side effects. Especially electrolytes like magnesium or potassium which can have cardiac effects if thrown out of whack)\n\nEdit number 2: found the post I was speaking about :)\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/43u7o0/magnesium/",

Then he left and my dog went after him and wouldn't come when I called so he ended up walking back to the house with my dog trailing him.

            "selftext": "So for whatever reason, I couldn't leave my apartment for 6 months straight. I guess it was some kind of phobia or severe anxiety.\n\nI had zero support and couldn't pick up a phone because I didn't have one.\n\nAnyways, I recently got myself to a hospital and was discharged and harassed then abruptly sent home.\n\nToday, having had enough of this bullshit, and wanting to take things into my own hands, I forced myself to go outside. It wasn't broad daylight, but it was evening and there were quite a few people up and about, so I consider it a step forward.\n\nThere was a problem however. While I did not faint and have an adverse reaction, I was acting *odd*.\n\nFor example, the way I walked was very weird. I could feel it. It was like I was bent over, or limping. This wasn't due to back pain, just me being stiff from anxiety. I was also very sketchy and twitchy, looking at people funny, and avoiding eye contact.\n\nNot everyone let me be. Some people laughed and pointed, some people avoided me noticeably (they would literally step on to the street to avoid being on the sidewalk with me as they crossed my path). Some people clung onto their items tighter. I felt like crap.\n\n But this is to be expected after nearly NO CONTACT WHATSOEVER for all this time.\n\nMy question is this: Are these effects permanent? Will they wear off? \n\nI'm not really a suicidal person, but I cannot imagine living the rest of my life like this. This is a little too much.\n\nEDIT: Thank you all SO much for your words of advice and shared insight. It's great to see so much good intention in one place. I've constructed an exposure ladder around an hour ago and i'm going to follow it till I can dance around in broad daylight while keeping a straight face. Stay strong everyone! ",

            "selftext": "Long story short I have some pretty terrible anxiety. When I had health insurance I was seeing a doctor and taking pills, but everybody complained to me that I didn't need pills so I stopped taking them and let the insurance expire. \n\nToday I went to a fast food place to grab a bite to eat, drive through. Person ahead of me ordered like 30 dollars worth of food, I ordered just a regular meal. \n\nGet my food, and proceed to pull behind car that was ahead of me. They aren't moving. I wait a little bit, thining they're just texting. Still not moving. Still not moving. I get a little closer, still not moving.\n\nAt this point my heart rate is increasing and I'm becoming flustered, so I send a little love honk their way. Still not moving. Not even acknowledging my honk. By now I'm becoming increasingly flustered and my heart rate has increased, I start wildly throwing my hands in a very animated fashion and proceed to send a few more love honks. The lady yells something at me, but I couldn't hear it. I yell back and tell her to move out of the way.\n\nBy now the people behind me have gotten food, and since I am not going anywhere, they can't go anywhere. \n\nThere is another lane to use, but we're all so squished together that nobody can get to it.\n\nIt's at this point where things just kinda blur. I proceed to lay on my horn. Like, non stop. Someone steps out of the car and I proceed to go into full panic mode. Thinking I'm about to get jumped or someone's gonna try to injure me. I roll up my windows and lock all my doors and proceed to hold my hands above my head\n\nInstead, the person explains that they are simply waiting on their food, and they were told to pull upto this spot. \n\nIt's at this moment, where everything just seems to reset, and return to normal levels. My heart rate slows, my breathing calms down, and I know the person could see the confused, puzzled look on my face, as if I didn't know where I even was. \n\nFinally their food is delivered and they proceed to go on their way, but not before the lady hurls some slurs at me. \n\nI went home and honestly threw my meal away, didn't even eat it.\n\nToday my anxiety beat me. The last time it did this, I walked out of my job cold turkey, and that was months ago. \n\nMy brain was so fixated and concentrated on a specific thing, that I didn't even consider they may just be waiting for food. And then what I like to call the aftershock came. Oh I'm a failure, I suck, I'm stupid, I'm never going to do anything important, I don't have a future planned, etc.\n\nWhen I was home I drank 5 out of 6 beers, and proceeded to emotionally dump all over Facebook, which wasn't perhaps the best idea, but I have literally zero people to talk to in my personal life about  this kind of thing.\n\nAnyway, apologize for writing the mini-book.

I seriously think that I'm one of the ugliest people I know and I've been left out of a lot of stuff (especially when girls are involved) because of that.  I feel really anxious whenever I go outside and I'm surrounded by normal, nice-looking people.  I have Asperger's and I'm pretty sure that I have facial features consistent with having a developmental disorder so people can tell something is \"different\" about me from how I look.  I've never had a girlfriend and I feel like women get uncomfortable when I approach them, like they think it's weird or gross that I'm interested in them.\n\nMy forehead is disproportionately large (and my head in general, see the second pic) and my jaw is kind of sunken in so I need to grow a beard to hide it.  My hair grows in a weird direction so there's no way I can have a cool hairstyle.  My teeth are chipped and crooked but it's hard to tell from the lighting in the pictures.  I think that my features give me kind of a retarded vibe, like they remind me of the features I've seen in other people with disabilities, during job interviews I always feel like the people I'm talking to can tell I'd be a shitty worker from the vibe I give off.\n\nHow do I deal with this?  I'm honestly considering getting plastic surgery or dental work at this point, I'm tired of not being able to fit in with other people just because of how I look.  I go to the gym every day and I feel embarrassed being surrounded by attractive people, I feel like I really stick out.  I want honest feedback, I don't want people telling me I look alright just to make me feel better.\n",

I struggle to understand reading for school (college freshman), when I once had reading comprehension scores in the 99th percentile. I feel like I can barely understand what's going on anymore. I was playing a video game with some friends earlier, and it felt like I just couldn't do what I wanted to do. I would know that I have to do something, but it would always come too late, or I would mess up an input. The only time when my mind seems to work at full speed is when I'm panicking about some health concern. Now I'm starting to think that my mind is deteriorating, early onset Alzheimers or something like that, and it's tearing me apart mentally. I don't know what to do anymore.",
