            "selftext": "I recently moved to Michigan from California for College. It's my and my wife's first time living alone. It was a big step. Since the move I have been struggling with anxiety. I came out here to attend a certain academy that I have been looking forward to for years. I ended up having multiple panic attacks and decided it wasn't going to work out. It was a huge blow to my self esteem. I was lucky though because I was able to transfer into a similar program that fits my needs much better. For a few days, I was doing good. Everything on paper worked out but yet I was still miserable. This is when I knew I had a problem. My mind was constantly racing and ripping apart my sanity. Last night was bad though. I woke up this morning feeling sick to my stomach. I was physically tired and felt like I wanted to throw up. Enough was enough. I called and made an appointment with our school counselor and I feel good. I look forward to starting this journey of fixing whats broken. I wanted to be strong and I thought that meant sucking it up but that didn't work. Sometimes we need to accept we have problems and we need help from others. My appointment is first thing in the morning. \n\nThanks for reading and I truly love this thread and everyone in it. ",

Coming from a family that doesn't see mental health as an importance, I've never really looked for help. I'm 24 now and I finally think its time to seek for help. I basically jut called the number on the back of my insurance card and they set me up with a therapist and psychiatrist. I typically avoid most doctors unless its absolutely necessary, but I've reached my limit here.\n\nI'm just so nervous/stressed/anxious about the upcoming appointment. My biggest fear with doctors in general is not being taken seriously and them understanding what I am trying to say. When  I get put on the spot I tend to not explain myself very well. Or what if I say the wrong thing because I couldn't explain myself and they end up thinking I'm a lot worse than I really am. I don't drink or do any other drugs besides weed, and I'm afraid telling them will change my treatment or any future medications. \n\nPeople with experience please give me some insight/reassurance.

They are work to me. I don't dislike talking to people but I have a threshold. \n\nProblem is this causes anxiety because I don't want my coworkers to think I dislike them and have them not want to include me in stuff.\n\nAnyone else relate to this?",

I apologized to the friend and thought that was that. \n\nHa, I should have known anxiety and life weren't going to let that happen. \n\nA friend messages me because of a comment I left on a picture. I've had problems with this friend but we've been trying to work it out. She chastised me for not asking to hang out. This month has been terrible. My family is having serious financial problems and my grandmother got hurt. My phone bill hasn't been paid (due 30th of month) so it's not even on. I told her this and apologized and got told \"more excuses.\" This was enough to set me off, of course(!). She then told me that the friend I was supposed to go to the car meet with said something similar. This would be out of character for that friend but idk. \n\nI'm depressed, anxious, and the headache doesn't help. I just want to disappear. \n\nI'm sorry to take up your time if you read this.

But i'm 19 going on 20 soon, I dropped out of school officially when I was 17 but hadn't been there for almost a year before signing the papers because of my Anxiety and Depression. I've been pretty fucked up ever since, living the NEET life leeching off my mum, which i'm really not keen on.\n\nI've done very minor \"work experience\" related things but my anxiety took over and I screwed up both of them. This is only my first shift but I think this time things are different. I felt like I was actually being inducted properly and they were actively expecting me to make mistakes since there's a lot of things to learn and remember. So I spent the shift just trying to learn and take in as much as I could and help out where I could.\n\nI can usually barely handle going outside to take the garbage away and yet today I spent 6 hours with 4 other people i've only just met and had to speak to several others.

            "selftext": "I'm in 11th grade. Today was my first day of school. We only had three hours.\n\nBy the second I was struggling to breathe. Hid it until the end of the day, got home, told my parents everything was good, had lunch, went in my room and struggled not to selfharm. Something I haven't done in months, and haven't thought of since the start of August.\n\nA summer's worth of therapy to be prepared for school, tore down in one day with time to spare.\n\nMy mum is confined to a wheelchair after beating cancer and she has more energy than me. I know a 55 year old man with ALS that has more energy than me. My classmates endure whatever they have while still maintaining an intense social life, a relationship with an SO, and school.\n\nAnd then there's me. Too tired and afraid to get a decent haircut, too selfhating to even think about having a romantic relationship, too paranoid to maintain a friendship without convincing myself that they hate me every couple months, too panicky to go to school.\n\nThere are several things I could be doing to help myself right now. I could finish my homework, which I mostly didn't do because it made me think of school and that made my anxiety levels spike to the roof. I could ask my therapists to move my next appointment closer to plan something. I could cry my heart out to my closest friend, whose reasons for caring about me I can't understand. I could('ve gone to) buy school supplies as so far I've bought a couple pens, a pencil, an eraser and a sharpener. I could shower. I could work out a bit.\n\nBut any of those options requires effort and social interaction. I'm too sad for the former and afraid for the latter. So instead I've wasted the day by reading stuff on reddit and playing videogames - which I didn't enjoy because doing either makes me feel ashamed and worthless. And it's been my only coping mechanism for the past 15 years - I had another, but as it's cutting my arms, I had to stop.\n\nI already know what's going to happen tomorrow (mostly because I've played it again and again and again and again in my head since the end of last year): I'll wake up, I'll go to school while everything in my body is telling me not to, I'll take the bus, get off a couple stops late, I'll wander around school trying to make up my mind, I'll miss the entrance, and then the panic will set in. Might even make some of my classmates worry as all of them know I'm not completely right in the head after having several panic attacks at school. Afterwards... I suppose I'll either go home and lie about going to school at all, force myself to go to school anyways and have a crisis there, or come home and tell my parents the truth - which scares the hell out of me. And if I go to school there's also the possibility I'll be hospitalised if I don't snap out of my crisis in an hour.\n\nI'm demoralised and exhausted. I've been given Xanax, Lorazepam and Quietapine - and none of them worked. I'm starting to consider more and more seriously the thought of killing myself and it terrifies me.\n\nI've never been very happy. As a child I cried a *lot.* Probably more than twice a day, everyday. Kept at it from 1st to 4th grade, when I stopped because everyone shamed me for it. Then my dad cheated on my mum and I spent from 5th to 8th grade hating him. Middle school was horrible, I was the weird loner that no one liked, got picked upon by the few friends I had and spent the last year there silent - I spoke to no one and no one spoke to me. Then came high school and I wasted the first year because the first \"friend\" I made turned out to be manipolative - isolated me from the rest of class and laughed at/hit me in private until I managed to distance her. Last year I changed psychologist, the new one laughed at me when I had a panic attack mid-session. And then I started having panic attacks everyday.\n\nI've always been a mess. I'm a mess right now. I can't see anything but being a mess in my future. I'll probably cry myself to sleep tonight.\n\nI couldn't handle middle school, I can't handle high school, how the fuck am I ever going to handle living?",
