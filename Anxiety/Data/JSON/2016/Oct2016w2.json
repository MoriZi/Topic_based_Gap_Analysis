I only ever got anxious at appropriate times in my life before I've had these problems with my anxiety, say for a big test or a school play. But since August I've had pretty terrible anxiety, more specifically health anxiety. I would overthink and cling to a terrible thought over a benign pain or feeling in my body and have a feeling of impending doom for a time. Lately I feel like at times I can't speak or write descriptively, sometimes I know a word but I can't seem to get that word, like that word is out of my reach. Sometimes I would test myself to think about some certain topic and talk about it in my head, but I would end up having to stop at points or the whole sentence would feel like it was written at a 4th grade level. There were times where I was talking to someone and my words would run off and I would speak like I was having a stroke. I feel like I'm losing my mind sometimes.\n\nThis has been my main gripe for the past week or so because I aspire to be a journalist/writer when I'm older and I feel like that will hinder my chances of getting my dream job. I also do commentary for my high school's basketball games so I feel like if I can't keep my anxiety in check, I'll look like a complete idiot and possibly lose my job.",

I was just starting to eat my food when i noticed a strange feeling in my head, I start to get anxious because this feeling in my head usually triggers my panic attacks, but I try my best to control it.\n\nI make it through the dinner, my mom kept asking me if everything was alright, because Iooked concerned about something, i just said im fine. In the car going home I start to get a really bad feeling, like i have a brain tumor or im having a stroke, this feeling escalares to a point where i just snap, i say to my mom \"please help me\", i feel the left side of my face to go heavy and numb, and i just go fucking crazy, i knew i was having a stroke for sure, i screamed a lot, and i said \"im going to die here\" my dad stops the car, i just scream \"hospital\", we get there, im not sure how im still alive, and long story short they gave me a pill to calm myself down, i get a brain scan that showed i had no problems at all.\n\nI am now at home, they prescribed me some pills and i am going to see a therapist, I hope this is the start of a new life for me, anxiety has been with me for a long time, and I finally had the courage to admit i have a problem, if you too live with this disease, please seek help. Im still recovering a bit from the panic attack, but now i know i have no problem, and that it cant kill me. \n\nThanks for reading this, stay strong.\n\nEDIT: Thank you all very much for you comments, i woke up today still feeling a bit anxious, but now i am feeling okay and it gives me hope that i can go through this :) We are all gonna make it, im sure of it",

However, I was distracted by this horrible pit in my stomach the whole time and couldn't enjoy any of it. I kept having intrusive thoughts about how someday my parents - especially my dad, who I'm somewhat closer to - would be gone someday, and I had better enjoy this while I can before I'll never be able to experience it again. Of course, these thoughts had the exact opposite of their desired effect and I was anxious and sad the whole time. Lately this has been happening more and more; thoughts about death and mortality, about how temporary everything is, and also a suffocating sense of dread that something terrible and life altering is going to happen very soon. Even though my dad is in his early seventies, both of my parents are in good health, so I know that my worries are unfounded on that front, but it's still something that plagues me daily. It's gotten to the point where I can't sleep, kept awake by my fears of the future. I'm self medicating and trying to spend every spare moment I can asleep, just to avoid these thoughts. I'm in my very early twenties, I shouldn't be this consumed by thoughts and fears of death. I feel like I'm going insane. Help?",

            "selftext": "Never thought I'd say that. I genuinely, whole-heartedly miss depression. I was clinically depressed and experienced all that comes with that for over a decade. I didn't want to live. I didn't think I could possibly be in more agony than I was then. Boy was I wrong. \n\nThe anxiety started with a bang. My first panic attack. Knew I was about to die. Thankfully my best friend was there who has GAD otherwise I would have called an ambulance. Then nightly panic attacks, because I feared panic attacks. Great cycle. Thanks Amygdala.\n\nNow, I might have a panic attack once every few weeks. But the baseline of my daily experience is general anxiety. Any situations I can't bail from if I need to sets it off. I can't have a shower without being on edge. I go to work for an hour then leave because I am going to pass out, I just know it. The health anxiety - before my first panic attack I barely thought about my health. Now I do, nearly every second of every day. I'm going to have a heart attack, a stroke, a brain aneurysm. Hell, maybe all three at once. I am constanly on the edge of panic - sometimes I'm distracted enough that it recedes, but it's always in the background, ready to be triggered by some small non-event that normal people deal with daily with ease. \n\nI am always experiencing an adrenaline rush or adrenaline fatigue. The only solace is sleep. It takes me over an hour of a racing heart beat and intense body rushes to fall asleep. I drink. I abuse painkillers. It helps, barely. \n\nSo I miss depression. Desperately. I'm far too anxious to feel depressed. Anxiety is an immediate danger, it saps all of my energy and demands all of my focus. I don't have time to ruminate and wallow when I'm constantly battling my fight or flight response. \n\nWhilst my depression was a black cloud, a weight on my shoulders, a heaviness in my soul - anxiety is a wild relentless storm, pummeling me, it is a crushing weight in my chest, it is tearing apart my soul and sanity. There is no comparison between the two.\n\nI hope one day I will be calm enough to be depressed again. It is a foe I understand, that I can face, that I can sometimes escape. Thanks for listening. If you relate to this, I wish you didn't, I'm sorry your life is like this, I love you. \n\n",

            "selftext": "Anxiety is a never ending cycle and I want it all to end (the anxiety). I miss not panicking over every little health issue. This was supposed to be my fun last year of high school but anxiety and some health issues are crippling me from doing anything. I feel so nauseous everyday and my emetophobia prevents me from eating or even playing tennis. Senior year is supposed to be the best year but I wish this anxiety wasn't so crippling to me... I feel so upset about this and I can't even talk to my parents about it because they don't understand how anxiety works. They tell me to \"just stop thinking about it\" or that I'm faking all of this. I'm not... why would anybody want to fake something like this... all of my doctors and therapist are concerned for me and they suggest I go back on antidepressants. I mean I guess antidepressants have helped in the past but the withdrawal effects lasted a really long time and were really bad. I was on one of the lowest dosages of Zoloft at the time too so it was drastic. I don't know what to do anymore. I wish I wasn't like this.\n\nI've recently started taking birth control so that may be a factor, I switched medications yesterday because I didn't feel right on the first one. Today I feel the need to cry every time my parents talk to me and I just feel really sensitive today... maybe that's why I feel this way today. Or everyday. ",

Let me preface this by saying that usually I enjoy alone time, especially working 8-5 M-F a night to myself is night because I can go to bed early if I want or read all night and it never bothers me. Something about a no planned Friday night though, really puts me into an anxious sad state of mind. Maybe it's because I feel like everyone has plans on a Friday night and here's my lame ass just chillen with nothing to do. \n\nHow lame is this? I feel like a fucking retard for feeling this way. Why is being alone some times awesome and others (like this) make me feel so anxiously depressed? \n\nAnyone else deal with something similar? How do you cope? \n\nThanks ",
