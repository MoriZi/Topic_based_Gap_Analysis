            "selftext": "I posted the other day regarding being admitted to the hospital for lung problems that were just getting worse despite treatment. After a lung biopsy, which was luckily able to be done by sticking a needle through my back and ribs to get to the lung and not by a bronchoscopy. \n\nTurns out all of my doctors have been wrong about my condition. They all believed I had valley fever even though blood tests came back negative, my infectious disease doctor assured me that the tests usually weren't very accurate and I had that disease. But even with the treatment I was getting worse to the point where I was having trouble breathing which landed me in the hospital days ago. Now I have a worse diagnosis, I was diagnosed with COP-BOOP.\n\nCOP stands for cryptogenic organizing pneumonia, meaning that my lung is being taken over by fibrous tissue causing pneumonia, this type of pneumonia is not infectious to others but is causing swelling and intense pain while breathing. \n\nI've been prescribed big gun steroids that I will be taking for at least 6 months to a year at my doctors estimate. However, even so, my pulmonologist at the hospital does not know if this will treat it completely.\n\nWants me to watch my symptoms and go to the hospital if they worsen, such as more stabbing pain and shortness of breath. If I do not have worsening symptoms then I am going to be getting a cat-scan after 3 months of treatment and if they infection remains at 19.5mm after that time then he wants to immediately perform a  more extreme procedure. Which will be a lower left lobectomy.\n\nResearching this was confusing because average age of the people who get this disease is late fifties to sixties. I'm 21 so lucky fucking me. (Frustration talking, sorry) \n\nCryptogenic in the name stands for basically \"we have no idea what the fucking cause of this is\". Dr was surprised at this diagnosis and frankly so am I. It fits, however it is suspected to be because of an underlying illness that they have not been able to pin down yet.\n\nSo begins a new long waiting period. 3 months (maybe less if I worsen) I'm waiting to see if fibrous tissue and inflammation begins to shrink or else I'm going to lose a big piece of my lung. \n\nThank you to all of you who sent wonderful supporting messages, I really appreciated it. I don't have a large Social Circle by any means so it was nice to see even strangers caring about me. Thank you for all your kind words and messages. I really wish this update could have been better news, however with the size of the problem it's not looking like it's going to be a good ending. If I get worse I will be scheduling an appointment with the pulmonologist at the hospital again so he can admit me and get the surgical order drawn up. He told me that this is most likely because of the size of the tissue taking over my lung, if it spreads upwards even more or even worse becomes a bilateral problem then I will be out of options. Didn't think I'd be saying this but my doctor and I agreed that this will be the best course of treatment to prevent spreading and ultimately loss of function of both of my lungs. I'd rather not have this problem but I am facing the reality that if I do have to make a choice it's going to be better to just lose one part of my lung. \n\nThanks again for reading this as well. I don't know if it is really set in yet with me, the reality and gravity of the situation, yet in a way it has because I am still scared of yet another treatment not working. You will stay safe and stay healthy. I'm going to try my damndest to keep my head high and make that choice if needed before it's too late. \n\nGoodnight people. Peace.",

I had a med switch recently, though, and I don't think my body is handling it well. \n\nIf I *had* to have a panic attack in class, this was probably the best way it could have happened. My students were in writing groups scattered throughout the seats in our auditorium (I'm a music and theatre teacher), and it started in the last 5 or so minutes before the lunch bell. I felt it starting and quietly went to a seat and hugged my knees until I had to spit out instructions to pack up. As soon as the bell rang and they cleared out I ran backstage and curled up in a ball on the floor until I calmed down. A few students asked if I was cold, but other than that, no one noticed. \n\nI got very lucky. We could have been in my classroom. I could have been teaching a lesson. I could have been rehearsing with my chorus.\n\nI'm been doing okay so far today, and I'm crossing my fingers that there isn't a repeat occurrence. We'll see what my psychiatrist has to say about this next week. ",

I missed a semester worth almost (minus maybe three or four) labs and classes, and also assignments and exams. I couldnt find it in me to leave my room. Finals are next week. I have not talked to professors yet. Got to school clinic, discussed suicidal thoughts and inability to shower or eat or leave room for a week at atime, got prescribed with klonopin and some other pill I havent looked at yet, took one yesterday got a headache. Am at a complete loss, parents expect me home in a week with a degree. Can I request an incomplete for all classes in a semester? Are professors understanding. Is it too late to get registered with disability services, do I need a consultation with a psychiatrist, will that diagnosis take too long. I cannot stop out or withdraw, all of it is paid for, money is not an option for me. Please anyone if you could message me back and forth or skype or anything my mind is racing I feel completely hopeless.",

Her anxiety attacks stem from smelling any hint of marijuana. I really try and help to calm her down when she smells it, but she normally wants to be alone so I respect that. We live in a college town so it's difficult to avoid. \n\nThat's not even the real issue for me though. The issue is that she is so mean to people and just annoying at some points. When we are out she talks loudly about her sex life, sneers at people if they bump into her, gets angry when she doesn't get her way, complains all the time about how she's fat while continuing to chug beers, complains about anyone and everyone (most of her talking points) and interrupts me while I'm talking CONSTANTLY. I don't know if it's the extremely low self esteem she has, or the anxiety and depression or maybe she's just a shitty person all together, but I feel like I can't be friends with her if she continues to act like this.\n\nI don't want to abandon her because of something she can't control but it's almost embarrassing for me to go out in public with her, anything I can do to help her without sounding like the biggest bitch in the world? She doesn't take criticism very well. I just want her to be the funny, caring person I know she is on the inside.",
