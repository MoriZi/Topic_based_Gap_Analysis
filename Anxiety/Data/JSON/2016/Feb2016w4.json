Encounters like this bring on shaking, nausea, diarrhea, hyper vigilance, crying fits, insomnia and nightmares, all lasting several days.  \n  \nIt's sometimes even a much smaller trigger, or one I don't really pick up on at all, but I feel absolutely terrified nonetheless.  \n  \nDoes anyone experience this?

We bounce day to day from being optimistic to utterly hopeless.\n\nHe has credit card debt to get under control, and me finding a job that payed above min. wage would help, too, but it all just seems so impossible. Our rent is 750 right now. That's practically a house payment. But that's not counting water, food, electricity, etc you'd need to pay for a house. I feel like I need someone to hold my hand through the rest of my 20s and into my 30s, and not because I'm lazy, but because I'm completely clueless. I don't know how or what I need to know about growing up and I feel so lost. I've been checking out /r/personalfinance but...fuck, man. I'm still 100% lost. \n\n\nMaybe if we cut it up into goals?

            "selftext": "I'm so worried. I have some sort of flu which just isn't leaving. I developed it last Thursday, had a uti as well which I was taking antibiotics for. Felt a little better Monday, but woke up at 7am after 4 hours sleep and couldnt get back to sleep. Then this is when I just went downhill. Monday evening I got this horrible feeling in my sinuses and throat, like something had swelled up inside my nose. I didn't have a blocked nose, it felt like it was behind my nose almost. So I tried to sleep and breathe through my mouth. I got this horrible burning sensation and an incredibly dry mouth, I felt like I couldn't breathe at all now. Spent the next few hours panicking completely because I couldn't breathe. I then had a coughing fit because of the flu, and I was choking. I couldn't breathe at all. Thought I was going to die. I woke my mum up and she got worried and phoned the paramedic, he arrived and said I could breathe fine, and my temp was a little high but that's all. I then went to my doctors office, she said I was fine but have a respiratory infection (cold/flu) and gave me antibiotics which doesn't make sense considering they're useless for viral infections. Anyway I felt like I was breathing in hot and thick air ever since Monday night. I feel like my heart is racing 24/7 and I'm unable to concentrate on absolutely nothing other than the fact I am feeling this way. I feel this lump in my throat when I breathe in or swallow, and I've been unable to sleep. I was literally awake 56 hours and each time I'd start to go, I'd make this noise and jolt up awake. I finally slept at 11am yesterday until 5pm. Feeling was still there! All day yesterday I spent feeling panicky again, worrying over why I don't feel normal. I also feel extremely disoriented, heavy eyes, dizzy, blurred vision and I can't focus on anything. Last night I got to sleep at 7am, it was a huge struggle to sleep and I was freaking out massively over why I'm not sleeping even though my body is so exhausted it feels like collapsing. \n\nI am just so fucking tired of this, I feel like I'm not even myself. I feel my life ended on Monday evening, because I haven't felt right within my mind since. I'm so tired in the eyes but I just can't seem to sleep or focus on anything. I have been inside a week because of this sickness, and its just not improving. I don't know if it's because I'm sick or because I'm experiencing some sort of long panic attack. I haven't been diagnosed with anxiety, but before this I often wondered if I had it. I've never felt this sort of panic before though. Can anyone help me?",

            "selftext": "long story short I have a lot of student debt and still have 2 more years to go until I start making any real money in my field. It IS a lot of debt, and I was very up front with him from the beginning. I told him I don't expect anyone to help me, but I was realistic and said if you want kids sooner rather than later I will need financial help with this.\nMy fiance makes about 50k a year and I make very little right now becuase Im just starting out but once I get experience I can command at least 65-70k minimum.\nIve struggled a LOT with feeling like a failure becuase I took out so much loans to start with and I changed my career becuase the first one wasn't my passion and wouldn't have made a lot of money anyway. Its been incredibly hard. I can't even afford to fix my cracked teeth or get a nightgaurd that I need to prevent more teeth from cracking.\nI work all the time and study every night and Im so fucking exhausted.\nThe stress HAS been getting to my fiance though. He grew up with parents who were very well off and I don't think he knows how to handle this. He has decided to get therapy becuase he has developed anxiety and I fully support it. I feel so bad becuase I know his life would be so much easier without me. But he says Im worth it. He says he knows this will be better in two years once I make more money and he doesn't want to miss out on me because he wasn't patient. Either way, I wont let him marry me until my position changes financially. I do NOT want to trap him.\nI found out his mom (and possibly his dad) thinks he should just break up wtih me. They think that while Im a good person, my past mistakes are just going to bring him down. This really hurts. I dont know how to forgive them, and I can't even look them in the eye anymore.\nThe worst part?? His dad supported his mom entirely through med school. The only fucking reason they have money is because he took financial care of her while she was incurring debt. I realize the situation is a little different here, but it feels so fucking hypocritical.\nI just feel so bad and so ashamed and like a failure. All Im doing is trying my hardest and to hear that I dont have their support kills me. Recenlty she messaged me on fb saying my status changed and she wondered if anything important changed. Idk what she was talking about but I feel like she was hoping we broke up!! Idk what to do :(",

            "selftext": "First off, I'm not putting this out there for attention. I'm not putting this out there for pity. That's not who I am or what I'm about. But I am putting this out there simply because it's not talked about enough. It's ignored. People feel ashamed talking about it. The stigma is real and harsh. But I'm doing my part to help reduce the stigma by talking about it. The more you talk about it, the more you realize YOU ARE NOT ALONE. I have made new friends, and grown closer to others because of this.\n\nI had a TERRIBLE day yesterday. One that rivaled my traumatizing summer of short term disability, major med changes, and SEVERE mood swings. You know how sometimes you wake up and you just KNOW its going to be a bad day? That was me yesterday. It took me about 2 hours to get out of bed. I went to work, but hour by hour I got progressively worse. The negative and racing thoughts were too much. \n\nI did what I do on rough days. I take an index card and write out every half hour with a check box. 1:30 to 2:00, 2:00 to 2:30, etc. Every half hour I get through my work day I get to check a box off. It gives me the feeling of accomplishment and helps me focus. I make my judgement call at my first break. Can I keep going? Can I make it to lunch? Ok. Lets keep going. Lets make it to lunch and make another judgement call then.\n\nI had two days this month that this worked for me. It's so silly, but it's huge for me when I can make it through a work day when I'm mentally and emotionally just ready to quit. When all I want to do is go make a blanket fort, grab my cats and coloring books and just shut out the world. \n\nYesterday I lost.\n\nYesterday I called off work at 7pm with only three hours left in my shift. I simply couldn't do it. I was overcome with so much guilt, but I had to do it. I HAVE to put my health and well being before my job, otherwise I wont be able to DO my job. But the guilt just made it worse. I know, \"that's what it's there for,\" but I hold myself to a high standard. To be there for my team, to be there for my customers. When I call off, I feel like I let everyone down. And even though I do it to help myself, sometimes it only makes it worse. Its a vicious cycle.\n\nAs terrible as my night was, as terrified as I was, I found comfort. I had my cats, I had support group of friends who are there for me no matter what, and I had my boyfriend (last, but absolutely not least.)\n\nThere's really nothing anyone can do for someone when they're feeling this way, except to be there. I know the supporting people must feel absolutely helpless, but I want them to know that they ARE helping. Just being there, being a distraction, being on the other end of a phone call, putting your arms around me and just letting me cry into your shirt and babble on about insignificant nonsense that is COMPLETELY illogical.... that's what I need. Your time, your support, your love.\n\nThat's all anyone can really do. Love and support, be there, and make time. It makes all the difference in the world. The rest is out of your control.\n\nThank you to my friends, family, coworkers, and especially my boyfriend or constantly being there. ALWAYS being there. Never complaining about having to 'deal' with me. Without you, I wouldn't be where I am right now. \n\nAnd I beg of you. All of you. If you are suffering in silence, raise your voice. Don't be alone. Being alone is scary sometimes, and can be dangerous. Reach out to someone. Reach out to a loved one, a coworker, a supervisor, anyone. \n\nCall your doctor. Sometimes it takes more than just antidepressants, and sometimes the antidepressants make it worse. Ask for a recommendation to see a psychiatrist. See what options you have in your health insurance or any sort of benefits from your employer. Some employers offer EAP (Employee Assistance Program) that will give you a set amount of health care appointments for free. Thats how I started my road to recovery. I started with free EAP therapy appointments. \n\nPlease do not sit around and let depression and anxiety slowly kill you. Do something about it. Take action. It's never too late. It might take EVERY LAST BIT OF ENERGY you have. But I know you have it in you. You can do it. And you will be glad you did.

I knew I was going to have to face the cult of girls that had been relentlessly bullying me for months at an after school activity (I saw them everyday, but it seems that it was just the breaking point). I honestly thought I was dying of a heart attack and had to be sent home from school once I finally came out of the panic attack because I was so upset I threw up. \n\nI'm 26 now. Ten fucking years of therapists, anti-anxiety medications, countless panic attacks, etc. Years of people telling me I just need to \"relax\", my own family not really taking my anxiety seriously, awkwardly having the discussion with close friends and significant others on how to handle a panic attack if I go into one around them. \n\nAs I was in the fetal position of my apartment yesterday during another one of those wonderful attacks brought on by (wait for it) the bill for my most recent therapist and insurance fighting the claim (Haha. ha.) a lightbulb clicked. \n\nIt may not be rational, but I can't help but blame those fucking high school bitches for creating me into the anxious monster that I am. I think that my experience being bullied altered the person I was becoming in a major, major way. Don't get me wrong, despite the bullying I grew up to be a very successful person and I've surpassed all the \"bullies\" in terms of leading a great life with an extremely well-paying career in a field I honestly love. But at the end of the day I am an anxious little ball of shit and at times it destroys me. \n\nMoral of the story, don't bully other people. Just be a nice person for christ sake. ",

            "selftext": "I had to get an ultrasound for my neck the other day and in the waiting room there was this lady who kept staring at my arm. She was so lucky that I was only sat down for about a minute before I was called in. I felt like going mental on her and I was on the border of having a panic attack. I've never had someone stare out my scars so much, especially after I had made eye contact with her twice. Like, wtf? Seriously lady? Did you not get the memo? You look at me as if I had just fucking murdered someone. Do you think I want you or other people constantly looking at me? Do you think I enjoy being stared at like I'm some kind of freak? No, but I'm not covering them up when it's scorching hot outside and the weather is humid. Have some damn decency for fucks sakes. And before anyone asks, I wasn't imagining anything. My sister saw it and even told me as well. \n\nUgh. I hate my scars so much. It's not to do with how they look though, it's more to do with the fact that they bring me so much attention. I'm not trying to seek it and I sure as hell don't want it. I don't want anyone's sympathies, I don't want anyone's eyes on them, and I don't want to feel like some deranged monster every time I walk into a room. I just want to be treated like any other person. If I could go back in time, then I'd cut in some place different. I made a mistake. It's my fault. I get it. But I don't want to be reminded of it every day.\n\nThere was also this incident that occurred about 5 minutes after my appointment. We were walking back to the car and there was this guy on his bike. My mother points out that he's staring at me and so I turn to look. I look and I see the biggest smile on his face. We held each other's gazes until he had passed behind me for a few seconds (still grinning at me very intensely). It freaked me out and I began panicking because I thought he was laughing at my scars or something. Well, he wasn't, because I was hugging my jumper and my scars were hidden. I asked my Mum why he was smiling and I asked if my scars were showing and she said they weren't. I'm a bit slow sometimes and I hardly get out of the house but I eventually realized why (I'm sure you can all too), it just caught me off guard. \n\nThis isn't a humble brag and I'm not trying to say anything about my appearance at all, I just honestly and truly HATE being stared at for whatever reason (most of the time), whether it's good or bad. It makes my anxiety go into overdrive and I just can't handle it, I get so overwhelmed. I realize that I can't control people's actions and that's it's only realistic for things like this to happen, but how the hell do you deal with it? I have a prescription for Oxazepam but I don't like relying on it all the time for when I need to go out. Can anyone relate?",

            "selftext": "For as long as I can remember I have been scared. \n\nWhen I was child if my parents ever went to date night I had fear they would die on the way home. I very vividly remember pacing the hallway at like 7 years old so scared I'd never see them again. \n\nI raised in a very strict southern baptist household, Christians believe that the only way to heaven was to be \"be saved\" by asking forgiveness for their sins and accepting Jesus in their hearts. I did this, as I was expected too. But I was always scared I did it wrong, what I wasn't fully repentant? What if that one sin made it all go away and I had to do it again? What if Jesus wasn't listening? I was always scared of Hell, dying, and the rapture. \n\nI no longer believe as a christian and am an atheist, it was amazing the relief that has caused. but sometimes I fear I'm wrong, what if there really is a god and I'm going to go to hell now. \n\nIt takes me forever to leave the house in the morning. I have to make sure all the small appliances are unplugged, check the door (try it 2 sets of 3 times), I have to touch each knob on the stove 3 times. I have to check each door in an order. I have turned around after leaving my house because I couldn't exactly remember if I had checked a door. The other day I stood outside and almost started crying because I wouldn't let myself leave. I knew the door was locked, but I didn't believe myself. Then I thought my dog had gotten outside even though on the way out I remember petting him on the couch. but, what if during the split second I had the door open walking out he had gotten out. Even though I couldn't see him...I had to go back inside and check if he was still on the couch. He was. \n\nMy husband asked me if I had turned the coffee pot off because it was off when he had gotten his last cup of coffee. In my mind, even though he said it was off, was that the coffee pot was still one and it was going to explode and the house would burn down and our dog would die or get loose. I almost left work, which is 20 minutes away, and went home to check. My heart rate elevated, I almost started crying, I tried to calm myself and tell myself I was over reacting but it didn't work. \n\nNoise causes me stress and anxiety. People who smack, slurp, pop gum, whistle, scrape their teeth on the fork, sniffle, repetitive noises and movements like a leg shaking. all of those things, and more cause me stress. To the point it's hard for me to focus on what I need to and can only focus on what is bothering me. I've lashed out verbally at my mother and brother, I've physically grabbed a pen from a coworker because she was tapping it constantly. I will stare at people, or mimic whatever they are doing. \n\nIf I come home from work it's hard for me to relax when I know there are dishes in the sink. I have to check that the toilet seat is down because what if the dog drinks out of it and he gets sick?\n\nIt's hard for me to make decisions because I'm always scared it wrong, or will disappoint someone. I'm scared to do things because I don't think I can accomplish it. Like studying for my GMAT, I don't start because I'm scared of it.  \n\nThese are things I deal with almost daily. Not to mention my health anxiety. \n\nI had cancer and everything that is weird in my body is automatically cancer again. I'm high risk for another cancer and am constantly scared of my preventative screenings coming back positive. \n\nThese symptoms did not start after I got cancer, I've been like this for years. It has gotten worse recently though. Well I feel like it has. I haven't done the best job of tracking it. \n\nI don't know if it's anxiety, or OCD, or just over stress. I am going to see my therapist soon and have not expressed these things to her previously and will. I just wanted to see if these were symptoms that any of you experience. I've been previously diagnosed with depression and was on medication. I exercise regularly, though I have only recently been able to start again due to recovery from cancer treatment. ",
