As much as I admire Gullermo del Toro's work, considering I've been struggling to get out of bed lately, I don't feel a realistic horror film about a haunted house is going to help chill me out or lift my spirits! \n\nBut, I worried that Dad would be offended by turning him down, or would see this as some sign of relapse, like I *should* be going, to get out of the house etc.. And now I'm having flashbacks to times I disappointed people, made them upset and one time in particular I reduced someone who I care for a lot to tears, she's no longer in my life\u2026 this is despite the fact Dad has said \"it's OK don't worry\", my brain is screaming HE'S LYING. \n\nHistorically when this situation has turned up I have sometimes been frozen with anxiety all night from guilt shame and the 'what if', and turned up late for work/voluntary/lectures/friend's socials/doctor's apt.s etc. the next day. \n\nIn other incidents I would get the sudden idea that e.g. people wanted me to get really drunk so I'd 'fit in' better, and I end up compulsively drinking\u2026or I'd get the idea my girlfriend wanted to break up with me and was planning to cheat on me, so I'd start sabotaging the relationship until surprise, they actually *did* want to dump me. Sometimes this occurs when I'm an insomniac paranoid state and not entirely aware of what is going on. \n\nI seem very susceptible to unusual or 'overvalued' ideas one of my old therapists said, and compelled to act upon them to relieve the anxiety.\n\nAnyway does anyone else struggle with these sorts of thing and how did they learn to manage it? \n\nedit: Mother of up votes, I guess that's another 'DAE has anxiety disorder' question unanimously answered by the sub today!

            "selftext": "There's a recent post in here where OP was scared about nothing being real and going crazy, and I shared my own experience with derealization. It's such a recurring feeling for me that I too am worried about my mental health. I try my best to ignore it but it always comes back, occasionally in the form of a coincidence or deja vu. Sometimes it's as though I'm in a dream and the world seems fuzzy or hazy, then other times it's like I'm living in some heightened sense of reality. \n\nEvery once in a while out of nowhere it'll hit me so strongly that my stomach will drop and I'm shifted into some altered perspective of what's real. Then once I'm in that state of mind, there's always one word that pops into my head: old. The first time I felt this I was in elementary school.\n\nI always try to tell myself that it's just anxiety and everything is fine, until I remember that I exist in a universe that either came from nothing or always was, and I'm living on a planet spinning around in space when really existence itself is a mystery. Why is there anything at all? How is it that the human mind evolved in such a way that we're aware of our own existence and mortality? Regardless of whether or not you even have anxiety, you must admit it's all so strange. \n\nSometimes I look in the mirror and say \"this is me\". It may sound odd but when I stop autopilot and allow my mind to realize itself, my reflection almost seems unfamiliar.\n\nKeep in mind that I don't always think this way, but it's enough to make me question my sanity even though I live a seemingly normal life. Wondering if the entire universe just exists in my mind isn't something normal people do, is it?\n\nI just want to see if anyone else can describe their experiences with derealization/depersonalization so that I won't feel so alone. Hopefully there's someone out there who can relate.",

They can literally have only had one beer and I still become extremely anxious. \n\nI'm not sure why that is. It never used to be a problem but has developed and it is really effecting my marriage. My husband drinks and when he does it turns me into a mess. For example, last night I kept having panic attacks despite loading up on Xanax.  How do you mentally get past a trigger like that? ",

When I'm drunk everything is normal, ego is at the normal level, not every discussion is an attempt to manipulate me, not every discussion is supposee to be either perfect/awkward. Most conversations are in-between even amongst non anxious people there are a lot of awkward moments. Anyway my idea is that alcohol gives me good self esteem, self love and makes me deal with people for who they are. If they are good I'll be good to them, if they're bad they'll get equal treatement.

But what I realised with the counselling is the weekly emails didn't help when I needed it because I could maybe have a 1/2 anxiety attacks in between each email and spend hours thinking about what to write in each one. \n\nSop what I am asking/proposing is some of us form a group so that when we have good days we can all celebrate and communicate and on bad days we can be talked out of our anxiety/encouraged. This could be on reddit/whatsapp/email or whatever platform but just to feel constantly connected to a supportive group any time someone has negative thoughts or a big win that they have noone else to share with.\n\nAny thoughts please share, I may also post in other subreddits.",
