It made me extremely depressed, caused me to space out, I lost my short term memory while taking it, lost my sexual libido, horrible nightmares, insomnia, and I was incredibly jumpy/on edge.\n\nI talked to my doctor after I finished the prescription for the month and told him it wasn't worth it.\n\nI mentioned that my sister takes Lexapro and it works for her and I asked \"Since she's related, will the medication work similar for me?\"\n\nHe said it's a good idea to start with Lexapro (10mg) since we're trying new medication.\n\nAnd holy fuck.\n\nThe first week after I got off Zoloft, I felt a million times better. I don't owe that feeling to Lexapro, it's just I finally got off a medication that didn't work for me.\n\nNow it's three weeks since I started and God damn. I didn't know the \"non-anxious\" feeling existed.\n\nMy girlfriend noticed a change for the better. Increased libido, happier, no longer spacing out, no more waking up in the middle of the night from nightmares... ...and finally, no longer as anxious as before.\n\nI go back to the doctor next week to tell him about this trial period for Lexapro, and I think I'm going to stick with it.\n\n**TL;DR - Just because one medication isn't working for you but it did for others doesn't mean it's meant for you.

            "selftext": "So yesterday I took a reluctant return back to Facebook after about a year and I immediately regretted it.\n\nSo first off, I'll explain why I stopped using it, firstly it was adding to my depression, I am definitely not one of these people who sees their friends doing awesome stuff and gets inspired to get their shit together and do the same, I just ruminate on how much of piece of shit I am, not so much anymore though. I also find overly happy people annoying above all else, I am not sure why but it just bothers me, maybe it's because I cannot for the life of me understand how someone can be so content. But it was also because it was a major point of anxiety for me, I would refresh my feed to see if anyone would comment or like and I would feel weird answering right away to I would wait 10 minutes or so and then comment and a bunch of shit, that in retrospective, is stupid.\n\nWell yesterday I made a post addressing the people complaining about Game of Thrones spoilers. I, in summary, said that the people spoiling a major plot point are arseholes but the people who are complaining should really know what to expect as the current season is five or six episodes in and whenever a new episode comes out there are always the same people complaining about spoilers. Now I may have been a little more abrasive and more generous with my favourite swear word, cunt, but that was the gist of the status. Now I thought it was not only a valid point but also a tad funny, apparently not, some people were legitimately mad.\n\nMy therapist encouraged me to be more myself in public and I am trying to be more active both on FB and Reddit but it seems I can't be. I honestly feel as if I can't be myself around my \"friends\" other than a select few. I feel as I should dilute myself and be less confrontational with my opinions but that wouldn't be true to me and I have lived too long with a mask. \n\nSorry for the long post but has anyone got any advice for me?",

I came out of the house one day to find someone had broken into my car--I made the appropriate phone calls and got everything taken care of in 24 hours. My best friend got married last summer, and everything was going wrong on the wedding day--I helped keep her calm and kept things flowing. I moved almost 2,000 miles across the country and didn't shed a single tear or have a care in the world...until two weeks later. I've had *many* people tell me I'm someone they would want around in a crisis. \n\nI could give a million more examples, but the gist is that I rarely feel anxiety in the moment when big things are happening. It always comes a few days or even a couple of weeks later. Then it's at a point where I have a hard time connecting the anxiety to the thing that triggered it because I'll be in the middle of doing something benign and start freaking out for what feels like no reason. \n\nDoes this delayed reaction thing happen to anyone else/ any idea if it's normal? It's almost like I turn the feelings off in the moment, and then they pop back up later. \n\n\n",

I'm so tired during the day but if I go to bed then my brain decides that it doesn't want to sleep. It's like I have this hyperawareness of my surroundings, and I can't turn my brain off. This has been happening for about 2 weeks now, but it feels like several months. Benadryl helps, but it knocks me out and I end up with a massive hangover, and it feels like I didn't sleep at all. A few times, I was able to sleep without Benadryl, but I woke up several times, and again, it feels like I didn't sleep at all. It's like being out of school completely fucked up my brain. Sleep deprivation heightens my anxiety, and I can't enjoy anything without dwelling on how tired I am. It's infuriating, and I wish my brain would just shut the fuck up and go to sleep. I hate being so tired, and then hitting the pillow and being washed with energy. I hate being afraid of my bed. I want the success of a good night's sleep. I tried all the tips, like deep breathing, counting, meditation, and sleep hygiene. It's really frustrating. I've never seen a doctor for my issues, because my parents don't believe in mental health problems, so  I've never been officially diagnosed with anxiety. The only reason I call my issues anxiety is because my symptoms mirror every symptom of anxiety. I finished my senior year of high school, and I'm waiting for college to start. I'm just hoping that, in college, I can find my own help. For now, I just need to make it through these next few months, and right now, it's getting really fucking hard.

Ok, so my name is Lukasz, im 23, 4 years ago I was diagnosed with panic disorder. It started with IBS(irritable bowel syndrome), which then developed into a constant fear about leaving home and being in places with \"no escape plan\"(for ex. a bus, Im sure you know what I mean). I missed almost 2 months at school, but as I was one of the best students, I didnt have any trouble to get through to my senior year. I started taking medication(paroxetine), and it seemed to work, at least for a time. Last year at school just flew by, some days were bad, some days were good, but overall I felt happy, I felt strong, I had the will to fight. After passing every exam with flying colors I got myself into a university, that's where things start to go downhill. New place, new people, new challenges, lecturers who treat students like sh*t.. I became very anxious, my self-confidence was gone, and in fact it still is since then. I passed 4 semesters(3 left), but on 5th I had to take a year off, cuz I just ceased to function in this world. Depression took over my life. I'm exhausted. I tried for 4 freaking years to recover, I feel like I just cant take this anymore. Nothing works. Medication sucks. Therapy is very difficult due to my hopeless personality. My \"friends\" are only there when they need their computer fixed(Im an IT technician), otherwise no one cares. I'm sure there's something in me that would show them \"hey, Im better than this, Im not a failure\", but umm.. I dont think I can show that something sitting in my room all day and dreaming about the better future I'll never achieve. It's not easy to find motivation when you're wasting your life. Oh man Im pathetic. Thanks for stopping by and reading this nonsense, it means a lot to me, hope someone understands what I'm going through..",

I feel like I'm \"saving\" them and that their affection for me validates my existence. I'm obviously not turning into an animal hoarder (had the cat for 8 years, dog for 3 years, small birds for a little under a year and the pigeon for two weeks after months of consideration) but I wonder how healthy it is to be doing this. My social anxiety is from fear of people acting unpredictably because of my dad's severe alcoholism in the past. Animals are straightforward in a way I find comfort in. If I pet my dog the wrong way, he nips, if I take him to the park, he'll be excited. Maintaining the animals' health and taming them also helps take my mind off of things. My budgies used to be terrified of people but now they'll fly into your hands for treats. Is anyone else getting sucked into a life where most of their relationships are with animals, though?",

Then I started to have hot flashes bad. I took my blood pressure at home. My blood pressure was 148/109.  I went to the hospital my pulse was 121. I was told I was having heart murmers. It was a horrifying experience. I am currently seeking a therapist because I am afraid of what will happen to me if I continue to stress myself out like this. Sorry for format I'm on my phone.\n\nEditing to say I am not concerned about anything medical. I am aware this was an anxiety attack and I do know nothing medical is likely going on.",
