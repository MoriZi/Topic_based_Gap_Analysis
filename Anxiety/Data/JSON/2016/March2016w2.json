            "selftext": "For the last few years I've dealt with higher than normal baseline anxiety, usually blaming it on work or other stresses in my life. However after multiple therapy sessions and medication trials it became apparent that my mind was not anxious about normal things. It was mostly around my health and \"odd\" bodily sensations. \n\nGoing to the doctors multiple times for GERD, nausea, eye issues, shortness of breath, excessive sweating of my feet, etc. became the new norm. My primary care doctor put up with my complaints but reassured me time after time all my tests were normal and was very healthy.\n\nThen within the last year I started having extreme panic disorder. These panic attacks were different than ones I had in the past. They didn't go away within minutes like before. They would hit like waves and continue to hit for hours on end. It felt like I was pumped with adrenaline and had no way to combat the feeling other than popping more benzos and crying into my pillow.\n\nThen one day during work I got up to get some food after sitting all morning and ended up in the ER from having a \"panic attack\" with a heart rate in the 170s and feeling like I was going to pass out.\n\nBecause of my anxiety history I knew how this was going to go however there was a young doctor on staff that day in the ER who took special interest in my case. She was very smart to note that even though I was provided anxiety medication and IV, blood tested and had passed my EKG, my heart rate was very sporadic when I would interact with her. So she decided to do a test. She asked me to lay down very still for a few minutes while monitoring blood pressure and heart rate. Then again after sitting up. Then one more time after standing up.\n\nThe results? My heart rate changed from 80 laying down, 100 sitting up, and almost as high as 140 standing. What was even stranger was that my blood pressure stayed the same throughout the test.\n\nBecause of these results I was ended up admitted overnight for observation. Doctors came in groups asking questions and studying me as they believed something else was going on other than anxiety. Basically the told me I had [POTS (Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia)](http://dinet.org/index.php/information-resources/pots-place/pots-symptoms). This was later confirmed at a Neurologist using a tilt table test.\n\nPOTS explained everything I was going through. I was relieved to finally have something to point my finger at.\n\nPOTS essentially is a syndrome where your heart has to beat faster to get the blood to your brain when standing due to poor circulation mostly caused by pooling in the feet and legs. Being dehydrated and not having normal electrolytes caused my ER visit to begin with.\n\nI know this may not help everyone here but I hope it may help a few. Salt and staying as hydrated as possible has now lowered my daily heart rate which as a result prevents the body from releasing adrenaline to fuel my heart to pump blood throughout my body fast. I still feel a little anxiety, mostly due to the months long worth of attacks and agoraphobia but I am now battling back with my new diet and doctors who will most likely prescribe some additional meds to help me address these symptoms.\n\n**TLDR** Got lucky with a smart doctor at the ER who diagnosed my HR increased over 30BPM from laying down to standing which is a strong indicator of POTS (confirmed later at neurologists). Told me to eat more salt and stay hydrated (especially in the morning) until the neurologists can manage my symptoms better with medication. No more panic attacks, GERD, or other odd sensations.\n",

            "selftext": "Hello,\n\nI try to be as active as possible on this subreddit to pass on encouragement and advice to others; even posting myself occasionally. I just wanted to pass a message on to others as it has helped me a lot.\n\nWhen you begin to have a bout of crippling anxiety you should take a moment and write two things you like about yourself. They can be large things like \"I believe I am a kind person\", or something as simple as \"I cook really good stir-fry's\". Sounds dumb but personally after about 6 months I mounted up many many pages of these. The only rule about myself is I cannot repeat anything. What this has done for me (along with medication and prof therapy) has allowed me to find some good within myself in my darkest hours. As you know, when you are overwhelmingly anxious you feel so trapped. \"Nothing will help, nothing will change, this will never go away...\", I see this feeling of fear in a lot of posts, and I just want to tell you, YOU ARE NOT ALONE.\n\nYou are beautiful. You are unique. You are special. YOU are the master of your own universe. Sometimes you will feel like the wall in front of you is so high that you can't climb it. You look at it and think \"hell.. i'm going to spend the rest of my life trying to get over this thing...\"\n\nBut the truth is- what they don't tell you is the higher you climb, the better the view becomes. I think our society paints an image of people living life in constant euphoria and happiness. We see movies, television shows, news articles; all looking at how brilliant others lives are and we wonder, why can't I have that? But in reality, everyone has there own demons. NEVER beat yourself up because you struggle with Anxiety. You are braver then you know. You are stronger then you realize. And you WILL get past those dark moments, and it makes the \"bright\" ones that much better.\n\nIn the past 4 years I have been so low that suicide came to mind (which was terrifying), but I've felt moments of pure euphoria and happiness.. however brief they may be. But the one thing I have learned from my own illness is that denying yourself the right to seek help will only make things worse. We all fear that if we tell the people around us the extent of our illness that they will be repulsed or overwhelmed.. I used to think this is part of the illness alone but I think it attests to how separated our society has become from our own emotions. As a young boy, I was raised to think that tears were a sign of weakness, and emotions were something to be ignored and bottled up. But no more am I going to allow myself to suffer in silence. I am soooo far from perfect. I've made mistakes that have hurt me and even worse hurt those I care about- but this does not define me. I have days where I can't leave bed, can't talk to others... this does not define me. I have days where I truly feel that life is too much to handle and it will never get better- but this does not define me. Don't let your illness become how you define yourself. \n\nI have the utmost respect for EVERYONE on this subreddit, and I have not seen any other reddit community that is this supportive. I came to this subreddit in a moment of despair, made a post- and had complete strangers display that they cared about me. It blew my mind. How could these people who I never met extend so much kindness towards me ? It's because when we are alone we feel trapped and helpless. But together even in our darkest moments we have a community that understands what we are going through. I don't expect any replies to this, this is merely me extending my gratitude to all of those who participate in this Subreddit. \n\nThank you everyone who subscribes to this, and I want to let you know that whether or not you have been told this- your participation here changes the lives of others. There are people here with no one else to turn to, and I think it is beautiful that everyone here opens there arms for them in their time of need.\n\nNewMarylandVape.\n\n\n\n\"I refuse to be defined by the walls that confine me\"- T.V.\n\n\nEdit: TL;DR: You are so much more then you think you are. Thank you for being a participant in this sub-reddit. It changes the lives of people with no where else to go.",

            "selftext": "My friends, I so wanted to post here a week ago when I was shaking and trying to shoo away the feelings of undeserved opportunities along with the agony of even having to go through with it, but i did it. I did an interview. \n\nAfter all the pain and pent up stress I gave myself, all the regretting of even applying in the first place, along the mind set of \"how COULD they ring me to arrange an interview?? did they read the wrong CV????\" All the thoughts that seem to go hand in hand with anxiety about not even wanting the job, how homelessness was a good alternative because I wouldn't have to work and interact with people! How every job must be exactly the same environment as my old job, which in retrospect, sales + anxiety = not the best combination I have found.\n\n The aftermath of finishing the interview, being the first person to be interviewed and convincing myself I would never have a chance because clearly all the people after me would be 100x better and more friendly than myself, and well versed to the job, and why would they want to hire ME anyway? I wouldn't hire me! BUT after it all, I did it. I got the job. Anxiety is like that nasty girl in high school always whispering things about yourself that aren't true, or very warped to existence. I hope in my new job I can leave a bit of that stress behind, the people seem lovely and the job is very low stress and casual office stuff.\n\nIf I can do it, so can you! I believe in you all, and wish you the best of luck if you're still job hunting, it can be done! And not all your experiences will equate to what your jobs in the future may be like. Stay positive :) ",

Today I was only there for ~5 hours before I started feeling physically ill and just had to leave.\n\nBoth yesterday and today I had to lay down when I got home and ended up passing out for a solid 6 hours. I've been seeing a psychiatrist for the past two years (the panic attacks in particular started about a year ago) and currently am on Paxil and Klonopin.

            "selftext": "Hi all - I've been suffering with anxiety for about a year and a half now - but I've made a couple of lifestyle changes that have really helped me out - thought I would share, maybe it can help some folks...\n\nStopped drinking soda - for me it was Coke Zero - I would drink a 20 oz bottle in the morning and a 20 oz bottle in the afternoon (and sometimes one at night) - I don't know if it was the carbonation, the caffeine or the aspartame (my guess - the carbonation probably constricted my breathing a bit - and the caffeine heightened my anxiety - I probably would not have been quite so concerned with the very slight breathing constriction had the caffeine not had me so on edge).  I also take Zantac regularly just in case my acid reflux acts up - but frankly I think the reflux was just a by-product of the soda intake.\n\nBegan using nasal spray - I've noticed that the anxiety worsened in the winter - I didn't know if it was because of seasonal affective disorder or just being indoors so much or if it was something else.  My nose was running a lot, so I bought some generic Flonase(just for the stuffy nose - did not think it would affect anxiety one way or the other).  As my nostrils unclogged and I began breathing easier, I became a lot more relaxed (particularly while driving - the gas from the soda and the clogged nostrils would REALLY set off panic for me while in the car - it's usually where I had my worst attacks - hyperventilation, etc.).  Again, like the soda - I probably wouldn't have thought much of the stuffy nose had I not been so anxious in the first place.\n\nI guess both of these changes relate to breathing - when I was anxious, I would get fixated on my heart, digestive system, lungs - whatever I thought might be causing (in reality, very slight) breathing problems - these simple changes have really helped out over the last two months or so - it's been the longest period without panic for me since I first started experiencing anxiety issues in Oct 2014.\n\nAnyway, I realize there a variety of reasons panic gets triggered - hoping these tips might help someone though...\n",

For a little background, I get very self-conscious and anxious when I, like many others, feel like they are being judged. I fear being laughed at, doing something wrong in front of a crowd or any person who might pass judgment on me. Anyway to the example. My stepdad who is a very extroverted, uninhibited, say-whatever-is-on-my-mind-idgaf kind of guy asked me to put a ladder in our little car. I knew he was watching me to see how I would do it. Not a very difficult task on its own. A little maneuvering and the ladder would fit just fine. But I immediately felt the anxiety flood my mind and I just couldn't process what to do. I couldn't fit the ladder into the damn car. He then puts it in the car correctly and says something about me not being smart enough to pass a test. I know I would have had no problem doing it on my own or around people I'm comfortable with but as soon as I feel the pressure that someone might highlight my faults or try to evaluate or embarrass me, my anxiety spikes and my brain turns off. The common sense just leaves me and for the next hour/day/however long I beat myself up mentally over not being able to complete the simplest of tasks. Does this happen to anyone else? :/",

            "selftext": "I am 22F, who has suffered a mix of anxiety and skin-picking OCD since, at least puberty. Pretty consistently throughout life I've had anxiety attacks and meltdowns, which often involve self-deprecating, negative thought cycles, picking my face until it bleeds, pacing around, and inevitably doing nothing at all (not getting out of bed for like two days straight). My \"triggers\" feel like things like most everybody should be able to deal with without breaking down- a bad memory, social interaction, money, etc. \n\n\nI developed a pretty decent set of coping mechanisms on my own. I really didn't want to have to talk to someone about \"what I do,\" because even to me it seems **crazy**. My repertoire includes: long-distance running, biking, breathing exercises, daily journaling, and allowing myself decompress time before and after social events.\n\n\nSometimes those things all worked, and sometimes they didn't. Sometimes I felt like a functional person (and adult), and sometimes I felt like everything in the world was wrong and I was alone and soon my facade of a life would come crashing down.\n\n\nWhen I was 19, I decided to go see a counselor at my university. It was awful. It was always uncomfortable talking to my therapist because he was constantly trying to fit my behavior into some unfitting label. In the end he admitted that OCD and anxiety were out of his expertise. \n\n\nSo, obviously that wasn't so great. I waited another three years before seeking help again. I had **huge** reservations about it, and was scared of pretty much every step. What drove me forward was: talking to my Mom (someone I trust) about it; the fact that I clearly wasn't going to \"grow out\" of these problems; the fact that my coping wasn't working that well anymore, and anxiety was debilitating daily life with me missing classes and falling behind, worrying about losing my job, etc. \n\n\nThe second counselor I saw was much better. If you've had a terrible time with therapy, I can only encourage you to try again. This time, my therapist was a woman who listened patiently. She also didn't know quite what I meant when describing \"anxious picking meltdowns,\" but instead of trying to label that, she encouraged me to keep talking so she could understand better. She recommended me to a physician (also within the university health center), who was very familiar with patients with high anxiety. \n\n\nWe discussed options for medication, and I expressed my fears about side effects. I told her that I had been dealing with \"raw\" anxiety for a long time. It's a difficult but familiar factor in life. Changing that by some unknown degree, with meds, is terrifying. I think this was really important to recognize. \n\n\nI'm now a month and a half into 40mg of fluoxetine a day. Not terrible long, but I could cry for how drastic the shift was. Within a week, it was like my anxiety was just smeared away. I found myself getting \"nervous\" before social interaction instead of \"anxiously terrified.\" The OCD- the skin picking, did not just miraculously disappear (of course, since it's partly habitual), but my urges to pick and instances of it have been reduced drastically. As well as meds, I have been meeting weekly with my new therapist and physician. I'm terribly lucky since I can do this through the whole university network, for minimum expense on my student account. That said, I really really encourage looking into all the options out there, for meds or not... a huge factor in moving forward was being forced to articulate, and talk about these issues. When they're out in the open, suddenly it doesn't feel like this huge dark secret anymore.\n\n\nAs far as side effects go: I still feel like myself. I still have a full range of emotions and don't have a \"fog.\" I haven't gained any weight. My mind feels bright and awake, I **care** about daily life again.  I HAVE had trouble sleeping... which is a problem. But before, I was able to sleep 14+ hours a day. Now I just have to adapt to more like, ~7 a day. \n\n\n**tl;dr: Lifelong anxiety and OCD; sought help for the second time and everything went better than expected. Now take low-dose fluoxetine.**\n\n\n\nThis is only my personal experience, and of course everyone has different circumstances, and certainly different reactions to medication. I just wanted to share as a \"success story,\" to encourage anyone to get help in a way that is feasible for them. Thank you!\n\n\n\n",

Ye I hated each and everyone of them at first, I embarrassed myself on several occasions and hated every minute of the idle chit chat at the party but I did!! I actually did it! You wouldn't believe how hard these things are for me to do. I decided at the start of this week that I wouldn't be a prisoner to my anxiety anymore. Believe me it's been tiring and I'm currently sprawled on the sofa exhausted but I'm so proud of myself. I'm sure it probably won't last but it's a start!\n\nI'm currently seeing a therapist and she's been amazing. Its honestly helping. I can't recommend seeing one enough.\n\n\nMe - 1 Anxiety - 0",
