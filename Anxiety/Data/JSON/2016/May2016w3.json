I think about what conversations we had, word for word, and dissect what I said as being unforgivably obnoxious. Even online.\n\nI think this started with people telling me I didn't read social cues easily, so now I take every facial expression as meaning I'm overstepping my bounds and being annoying. Because of this I'd rather just be by myself and not talk to anyone, most of the time, even though I crave social interaction. \n\nI feel this has even spilled over and is affecting my relations with people I am close to. I talk very quietly in general and when they ask me to repeat myself I get very flustered and assume what I said was ridiculously stupid and say it doesn't matter anyway. \n\nI just wish there was a way to know if I REALLY am super annoying or if I'm just sensitive because of the comment that I wasn't good at reading social cues.",

My mom doesn't want to bring me to a doctor.\n\nI have 90% of the time a severe nervous tension in my chest, especially when I breathe out. I just get a sudden burst of panic, no matter the situation, and it's fucking exhausting and I hate it so much. I worry constantly about everything to the point of not functioning properly. I set myself stupidly high goals (I have a list of a large amount of things I have to do every day to get myself to where I want to be, but what happens is I do them for a few weeks then get burnt out and depressed for weeks) and I know I shouldn't but I can't help it. If I don't, I feel worthless and like I'm wasting my time. I've basically stopped messaging people on social media and so on because I feel like it's taking up too much of my time, but I end up spending a lot of time on there anyway, idling flicking down, ignoring my friends. I feel so fucking guilty about it and it weighs down in my mind all the time. I feel like I'm losing all of my friends, but it's always just easier to not message them or not go out. I've had a few traumatic experiences in my childhood, but I've only really started being like this after a specific traumatic incident last summer. I didn't believe that things like this could really happen, especially not to me (I guess that's a common feeling), but after this event I just haven't felt normal. I've never gone out with anybody and I feel like I never will because I'm not attractive and because of my cycles of putting pressure on myself to spend all of my time \"wisely\" I never have time to put into people. There are very few other gay guys around me, which makes it impossible really to date. Being gay actually hasn't really caused any anxiety for me. \n\nSorry for the block of text, but I just don't really have anyone else to talk to about this. Thanks for reading.",

I've had a lot of physical anxiety symptoms this year - vision problems, problems breathing, racing heart rate, etc.  But I seem to also shiver more often when I'm not in a full  on panic. This often happens when I  go back outside after a meal, after socialising.  It is colder on the street, but the shivering feels excessive. Like I'm one of these tiny scrawny dogs that is always in a state of nervous agitation and needs three jumpers.\n\nSorry if the question is stupid, I just wonder if this is really an anxiety thing.",

For the most part I handle my symptoms pretty well. Like any disorder, there are good days and bad days. Tonight just happens to be a little rough. \n\nI usually sleep with a light on (except when I am at school with my roommates or I am staying the night with my SO or friends). I usually sleep with my closet light on because I hate the shadows inside it. Within the last year I have gotten in the habit of sleeping with another light on too. It's usually a little lamp, but I recently started using my salt rock. Tonight, I am also sleeping with a set of string lights that are hooked to my bed frame. \n\nI am afraid to look in the two mirrors that are in my room. I hate looking at my reflection in the mirror at night. I also just hate looking at mirrors at night. I don't really know how to explain this, but I get really anxious every time I look at them when it is night time. \n\nI am also afraid of looking at my door. It's currently shut, but I also hate looking at it. It makes me feel anxious too. I also can't sleep with my back turned to the door. My bed is in one corner of the room, and the door is basically in the opposite corner. \n\nMy dog sleeps in my bed with me, which helps because if there were an intruder into my room he would wake up. But if an intruder were to break in to my room and harm me, my dog couldn't stop him. He's a tiny dog, and I would hate for anything bad to happen to him too. \n\nI know this will be completely ignored, and that is totally okay. But I just had to get my thoughts somewhere tangible (in a sense). I left my journal across the room and stepping my feet on the floor and around the bottom of my bed frame freaks me out too. I know there is no one under my bed, but I hate leaving my ankles at any thing's access I guess. \n\nWhat is horrible is that I am a psych major. I have been learning the  \"ins and outs\" of anxiety disorders, so I know the science behind what is going on. I logically can tell you that what I feel does not fit the context of my situation - I am safe, I will see nothing but myself in my mirrors, and nothing but clothes and boxes under my bed and in my closet. But I can't help it. ",

But what added to the uncomfortability of the situation was that teacher told about someone she k ows who has OCD and the symptoms and people were laughing about it. Someone has to do specific things in order to leave one's house and people just laugh?!
