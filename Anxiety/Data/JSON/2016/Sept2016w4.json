It has taken me 10 plus years to finally figure this out. \n\nI wanted to control my anxiety without meds, but I realized that isn't possible. I will forever be on meds but if that means my life is happy and I have no limit on what I can do mentally and emotionally, consider me happy to be medicated. Just wanted to share my story. ",

            "selftext": "TLDR: If you are under 30 in the Bay Area join our Slack by PMing me your email. We can organize events there and just chat. Pressure and judgement free chat. Just type away, no need to re-read what you typed, no need to edit, just send. Even if you don't think what you typed isn't worth sending, just send the message. Sometimes we just need acknowledgement from others. Lets band together, support and improve each other.\n\nWould anyone be down for this? Low pressure group with only one rule, NO JUDGING EACH OTHER, so everyone feels comfortable.\n\nEdit: I've created a Slack group. If you don't know, Slack is a chat client that you can download on your phone or use in a web browser. PM me your email so I can invite you. I thought a Slack group would be best because I know many people with anxiety freak out when they make plans on a specific day and leading up to the event can't stop thinking about it. So how it is going to work is anyone can suggest and event and whoever wants to go can just go. I'll make an effort to lead the charge for planning events. Also I want this Slack group to be your go to place when you are feeling anxious or just want to chat. For example if you are at a party and are panicking, go on Slack and start chatting. It'll make it seem like you are messaging very important people and it'll offer some anxiety relief. Also PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE don't be anxious to chat. I want this Slack group to be a place where people and freely speak and not feel the burden of doing so.",

I currently work from home as a freelancer (not by choice), and it\u2019s getting harder and harder to keep things in perspective. I get irrationally worried that I\u2019ve made a mistake, and when I DO make the inevitable mistake, it feels as if my entire world is falling apart. Like I\u2019ve failed in the one thing I still have in my life, and am therefore undeserving of life. Outwardly, I can accept criticism gracefully, but on the inside I\u2019m a screaming disaster.\n\nI can deal with those feelings. It\u2019s awful and makes me want to vomit until I die, but I\u2019ve somehow managed for years. What\u2019s giving me problems now is what I call \u201chiding.\u201d I\u2019ve become so afraid of these feelings that I\u2019ve started avoiding working by default. I don\u2019t open emails that have the slightest possibility of criticism. I put off sending emails that might lead to more work. I\u2019ve started avoiding social media because I might see criticism of my work (even though that has literally never happened, and rationally I know it won\u2019t). And with no boss or co-workers to check in on me, I don\u2019t have any impetus to snap out of it.\n\nThis self-isolation is bad for my mental health (I live alone and have little enough interaction with other humans as it is), and it\u2019s incredibly damaging to my work life. I need advice on how to stop. I\u2019m planning on seeing a therapist as soon as I can afford it\u2014but if I can\u2019t snap out of it first, I won\u2019t ever be able to afford it.\n\nHas anybody else experienced this?

REAL MEN don't need to reach out for help bc of a mental condition. REAL MEN suck it up and push forward. \n\nHow wrong I was. You know what REAL MEN do? Real men take care of their responsibilities, and above and beyond all, your health is your responsibility. There is SO much help out there for you and SO many ppl willing to help you. Lifestyle changes, talk therapy, outreach groups, psychotherapy, medication, journaling, exercise, religion to name a couple. In my darkest hour I told myself that I needed to fix myself on my own or else I was weak, inadequate and a failure. I told nobody about my situation and internalized everything. I can tell you first hand, this gets you nowhere. Talk to someone. Vent on Reddit; message somebody (message me!), try bringing it up to your most trusted friend / family member. Find a therapist near you and just send them an email. \n\nOnce you realize that you're not alone, things can became much, much easier. ",

I'm the type who never gets annoyed when someone shows me their photo album of their pet with 100 pictures in it :P\n\nI have always loved animals and more importantly, I love caring for animals. Don't even care what animal/pet it is. If it's mine, a friends, or out in nature, lol.\n\nI have grown up with dogs but currently have a rabbit and 2 fish and have been obsessive about making sure they are OK and always comfortable/not sick/bored/etc. I want to rescue so many more, but currently space and funds will not allow. I do what I can for now.\n\nI was at the pet store obsessively deciding between 3 different types of foods and how happy it would make my fish. I think caring for my pets diverts my attention from my own health and I can project that into (onto?) another being. I may not be able to take the best care of myself, but my animals will be treated like damn royalty. I always thought it would be awesome to have an emotional support dog, but, for reasons above, I can't. For moments out of the day, I can get out of my own mind and focus it solely on another and it just feels so wonderful knowing they're happy.\n\nTell me about your animals and how they have (or haven't) helped you :) \n\n**EDIT:** OMG! I can't take it--all of your stories are so wonderful!!! I've read through each and every one with a stupid grin on my face. So many animals and so many beautiful stories. Hold them close (if you can) and cherish your bond. And rest in peace to the sweeties who left us too soon &lt;3 ",

I can remember a time when life was easy, no panic attacks, no worrying. But, I was only a child. My anxiety has gotten much worse over the years. There are times when I feel okay and it isn't that bad, but recently it has gotten so bad that it is ruining my relationship. Me and my girlfriend have been together for about a year and a half. She is so adventurous. Always wants to go out and see the world. But me.. I wish I could go and do those things. Currently I can barely leave the house to go down the street. She doesn't understand the anxiety. She gets upset and frustrated when I can't do things. Which sucks because that isn't what I want. Little does she know, I want to go out and do those things more than she does!! But I just can't. I'm letting my anxiety win, which is something I have fought for so many years to not let happen. I just recently came across the term agoraphobia. I read all about it, and I'm sure I have that too. I am way too scared to go to the doctor. I just feel like they will tell me I have all these things wrong with me. I just started being open about the anxiety I have. I just don't feel like I'm living anymore. My relationship is deteriorating right in front of me. And I have no idea how or what to do. I need help. I'm just so scared to get it. And I don't know how. ",

This makes me feel like I have no value to people and that I will not make any friends or girlfriend.\n\nIt also shows how uncomfortable people are around me, because all the friends I make stop talking to me after a short period of time, and this is making me feel angry at myself, even though it's not my fault at all.\n\nWhen it comes to girls it's even worse. Girls want a guy who isn't going to make everyone feel uncomfortable (obviously), and I fail to see how the f*ck i'm ever supposed to land a date when i'm so awkward and weird.\n\nWhere the f*ck are all my social skills? I wasn't always like this. I used to be WAY above average when it came down to socializing. I used to be a top level charmer. Now i'm literally behaving like i'm autistic.\n\nAm I f*cked for life? If the answer is yes, i'd like to kill myself and get this shit over with. I can't take the humiliation even one minute longer if this is the way it's always going to be from now on.",
