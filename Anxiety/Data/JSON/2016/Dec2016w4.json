            "selftext": "I have never really been a very good writer or story teller, but I struggled with anxiety and depression the last few years - and I still do today but things have gotten a lot better over the last few months. I guess I'm just writing this because I know how difficult it is to live with anxiety and I hope maybe I can help maybe just one of you. I've never written anything outside of essays for homework before so I apologize if it doesn't read well.  \n\nI'm 24 years old, I live in Northern California and as long as I can remember I have had anxiety, I don't remember where it came from, it kind of just appeared. I think it may have appeared in high school due to stress, self-image issues, the pressures my parents put on me, and the pressures I put on myself, and things like that. I started smoking pot, almost every day, went to music festivals and did ecstasy, etc, staying out late drinking at the bar with friends - and all of this I was very against in high school. I went to a community college for a year and a half and ended up deciding to take a semester off because I couldn't go to class without breaking into a panic attack and being covered in sweat and before I knew it that that semester turned into two years.     \nI tried talking to my family and friends about anxiety, and that I was close to being suicidal because anxiety was ruining my life but none of them really thought it was serious so they kind of brushed it off. On the outside I looked like a normal guy, people liked me, I got along with my friends but on the inside I was crumbling and falling apart. I am a fairly attractive guy and never had a problem with women, they usually would just fall into my lap but I couldn't take them on dates without suffering from a panic attack. Somehow I ended up with a loving girlfriend that cared about me and somewhat understood my anxiety but was on the verge of breaking up with me because I couldn't go sit down and meet her family for dinner. I wasn't able to get haircuts without freaking out. I couldn't go to the doctor, and I couldn't even go to church with my family anymore without having a panic attack. All of this led to depression and suicidal thoughts for the last few years.\n\nThis last year I was tired of being hindered from my anxiety and I did as much I could to stop it. Here are some of the things that have helped me.\n\n1) I stopped smoking weed. I thought it was the drug that cured all my problems. I loved it. I loved the smell, the taste, the culture, and it did stop my anxiety while I was high, but when I wasn't I suffered from anxiety. I still smoke occasionally, maybe once or twice a month, but not 4 times a day like I used to.\n\n2) I cut back on porn and masturbation. I went from watching porn and masturbating once or twice a day, to doing it a few times a month.\n\n3) I started working out, which helped with my self esteem issues and generally made me feel better. \n\n4) I manned up and went to the doctor. She prescribed me Xanax and Propranolol. I don't take it everyday. Maybe once a month when something nerve wracking comes up like going to the doctor, or a haircut. \n\n5) I reduced my caffeine intake and just recently started taking L-Theanine. I used to have multiple cups of coffee, soda, energy drinks, and pre-workout in a day. Now I just have a small cup each morning with the L-Theanine and drink a TON of water throughout the day. I'm not sure if the L-Theanine is just a placebo, but it is working wonders for me. I feel much more calm throughout the day. \n\n6) Meditation. I used to think meditation was corny. I thought I had to sit on the floor like a monk, hum, have candles lit, and incense burning. You don't need to do any of that and it is one of the most important things I have done to help with my anxiety. I used an app called HeadSpace and guided meditation to get me started, and now I just do it on my own.\n\n7) I started making lists. I make lists for everything. I made a to-do list and every day I tried to knock three things off of the list. I used to be extremely stressed because I felt like I had so many things to do, and I was overwhelmed but after a couple days the list was empty. Another phrase that helped me that I picked up from Reddit is \"If it takes less than 2 minutes, don't procrastinate, just do it.\" or something along those lines.\n\n8) I started listening to audiobooks. I could never read a book without getting distracted but I just discovered audiobooks and now I've been listening to self help books on the way to work. They keep my mind from wandering, and help me relax.\n\n9) Cutting Back on Social Media. I never really have been too big on social media, but for a while I did go on Instagram, Snapchat, and Reddit more than I'd like. I spent too much time on them and I noticed that I would get depressed when I'm on them because I would find myself comparing myself to others. Theodore Roosevelt said \"comparison is the thief of joy\" and it is very true. I found out that if I move my Snapchat/Instagram/Reddit apps off of my homepage and into a folder I don't go on them nearly as much. Out of sight, out of mind.\n\nI'm definitely not anxiety free, I still suffer every day but a year ago I would say I was a 9 out of 10 on the anxiety scale, now I'm on a 5 out of 10. I was able to ease my way back into to school this year with online classes and I'm continuing to go next year in actual classrooms, I also just went to my girlfriends family Christmas party and they all loved me, both things I would have never been able to do at the beginning of this year.\n\nI know this post was kind of long, and after writing it I kind of want to delete it because I think it is poorly formatted and written, but I hope this can help somebody. \n\nEdit: Of course I spelled anxiety wrong in the title.",

It's the most absurd thing. Two days ago I knocked it out of the park with some things I was assigned to do, and even today I got an enthusiastic \"Thank you!\" text from one of my bosses who I helped out with a last minute thing, but now I'm frantic because it's 40 minutes til work is over and I haven't heard from my boss in over an hour, which isn't unusual, over a project that won't be necessary to discuss for at least a week. I'm partly frantic because I will be off all of next week, as will my bosses, and we won't be able to discuss anything and I'm afraid we'll all come back and realize nothing I was working on was correct. The craziest thing is that this week off is a reward for doing well and helping them outside of my regular duties over the past few months, yet I just can't shake the feeling that I'm going to make one of them mad and/or get fired.\n\n\nDoes anyone else feel like their employment is hanging by a thread even though your boss gives you feedback that you're doing a great job?",

            "selftext": "For a bit of context, I am in my first year of university. The school that I go to is fantastic, the people in my department of study are like one big happy family, and my professors are all super supportive (it\u2019s a relatively small school, so we can talk to and get to know the professors well). \nI am the kind of person who really likes to support people when they need it. Since uni is full of stressful times for everyone I have been able to bond with a lot of people and we come to trust each other pretty quickly. I\u2019ve been able to help a lot of people, and they help me too. \n\nI have a really good group of friends, but I am also a huge introvert, and have struggled with social anxiety for a large part of my life. Most of my friends know this, and they respect that, which I am always grateful for. They know when I just need to stay in my room instead of going out with them, and they know that when I am going through a rough patch and just don\u2019t want to be touched they do other things for me like message me and send me things. Everyone at that school is so amazing, except my dorm mates. \n\nThere are 16 girls in the hallway that I am in. With the exception of my roommate (who is really sweet and shy, and we get along really well), all the girls are very much the typical party-going, loud, preppy university girls. Not to say they don\u2019t have their positive attributes, but in my experiences with them, the close-mindedness they possess toward things like other people, different life-styles, and respect toward personalities other than those that match their own has become very irritating yet constant aspect of my day. I have often wished that I could have gotten to know them before high school or something because they might have been nicer, but because that is not case, I don\u2019t know them and they don\u2019t know me. \n\nNow to the actual event that I am frustrated with. One day the apartment representatives decided to do a Q and A with my dorm about life in uni. (It\u2019s important to note that my roommate had gone home for the weekend and was not here at the time) The questions were all anonymous and we just wrote them on little cards and put them in a bowl. Questions were asked like \u201cHow should I organize my room?\u201d and \u201cWhy are we not allowed alcohol in dorms?\u201d. I thought it might be a good time to ask a question, so I wrote down something along the lines of \u201cWhat are some good actions to respect people of different personalities (e.g. extrovert vs. introvert)?\u201d, with the hope that it was specific enough to find some suggestions, but not draw attention to the fact that I wrote it. I waited for a while, and thankfully my card was chosen. \nThe answer was not as I had hoped.\n\nThe conversation that followed started with the dorm representative talking about the difference between being outgoing and being reserved, basically stating that outgoing people take more risks and tend to get better opportunities for success and have a larger group of friends, while reserved people are safer with their decisions but it makes them less appealing, less likely to find a fun career or get married, reclusive, and more negative. She said that when it comes to an extrovert being friends with an introvert, it tends to be the extrovert who carries the introvert through life because according to her, more reserved people don\u2019t have the mental capacity to deal with social situations \u2018that are vital to succeeding in life\u2019, and often the introvert can pull the extrovert down, and it\u2019s important not to let that happen. She said that as women, it\u2019s our job to be the kind of girl that a man will find attractive, and if we don\u2019t put ourselves out there then we will never be wanted. One of the girls asked out loud what they can do to interact with and better understand introverts (which I thought was nice of her to ask), the response was telling the dorm that if your friend is an introvert, the best way to help them is by trying to break them out of their shell by forcing them to go to parties, keeping them entertained in social settings, and introducing them to your friends because if the introvert knows more people, they will feel more comfortable. The question concluded with the representative saying that if the person does not wish to follow your attempts to make them more outgoing, they probably don\u2019t have a positive influence on your life and you should surround yourself with people who will be more supportive of you. \n\nFML.\n\nAfter that question I told my RA that I had to go study for an exam, and left before my tears were too noticeable. I walked back to the empty dorm and just sat and cried for a while. I had no idea that what seemed like a simple and helpful question would turn into the head of authority in the building telling everyone I am living with that all the aspects of my personality that I cannot change is a negative influence on everyone\u2019s life and it should be their mission to either mold me into what they are, or to block me out completely. Before they came back, I thought it would be good to maybe talk to them about my point of view so maybe they can understand where I am coming from, but as I sat in my room and heard them come down the hall, the only topic I could hear through the door was about how good the advice was about how to \u2018deal with all those shy people around campus\u2019. I realized that I couldn\u2019t talk to them, both because I felt ashamed of myself for apparently being something inferior in their eyes, and because I didn\u2019t want to face them if all they would do is criticize who I am. \n\nWell the semester is over and I just got an email from my roommate saying she isn\u2019t coming back to the dorm because of the unhealthy environment the other girls had created in the dorm. I honestly don\u2019t know what I am going to do if one of the other girls moves into my room. The dorm has already become a stressful place to be for me because of them, and I don\u2019t know how I will make it if my room (which has previously been my sort of safe haven because I can lock the door and block out some of the sound when I just can\u2019t deal with people) is no longer safe for me to be. I hate this feeling, and while everything else makes me excited to go back to school next semester, I am actually scared to go back to my dorm. \n\nEdit: Thanks guys, I didn't realize I would get much response so soon. \nThank you so much for the support, I did send an email a while ago about it on behalf of my roommate (who did confirm that she is not coming back). I also ended up talking to a friend on campus about it, and  have gotten some help from them. Although *some people* might not understand the importance behind this kind of thing, I appreciate all of you so much, even if my petty worries are the least of a lot of our problems. Thanks again :) ",

            "selftext": "I've never been very good at making friends. Every single person I've become friends with approached me first. I have no idea how to make or join into conversations and I tend to keep quiet to people because of how self-conscious of a person I am. Very little people know anything about me, and this includes my own family. When someone asks me a question about myself, be it one of my interests or something about my life, I normally don't respond to them. \n\nI always feel lonely at school, but the problem is I have no clue on how to get people to want to talk to me. Not only does my appearance drive other people away, but whenever I *do* speak to someone, all I can do is stutter, mumble, and talk super fast. Plenty of the girls at my school share interests with me that I'd love to talk about, but I have no idea how to bring them up to people without coming off as incredibly awkward. Plus, I never want to admit any of my interests to people, anyway. Be it bands, video games, or what I like to watch on YouTube, I won't tell anyone anything about it. I've even started to become afraid to share things about myself with people on the Internet, which was something I never worried about before. \n\nI can't deal with the anxiety anymore. I am constantly scared of what others think of me and it's completely taken over my life. When I give someone my phone, I have to delete all the music and pictures I have on it beforehand. I can't buy things at the store, because I'm scared someone will see what I'm getting and judge me for it. I avoid other teenagers outside because I know they'll make fun of me if I happen to be nearby them. I've started losing my sense of self because of how many times I've pretended to like something just so I could fit in. I constantly think people are mocking me or are going to mock me and because of that, I never speak to people, which just ends up making me feel even more anxious and depressed. It feels like a cycle I can never escape out of. No matter how hard I try I just can't open up to people, even though I want to. ",

            "selftext": "I have been trying all kinds of things over the last year or 2, and i have just recently found a great point in my life where i am living anxiety free once again! I won't bore you all with a long story, but here are my most recent changes that have led me to become anxiety free and live a calm and peaceful life...\n\n1. Caffeine Free Life - i haven't had any caffeine for about a month now and i love the way my body feels\n2. B Vitamins - i have been using B vitamins to replace caffeine when i need energy, however cutting out even B vitamins has helped even more so\n3. Meditation - i try to meditate at a minimum of once a week, but preferably everyday or every other\n4. No Alcohol - i found that alcohol would cause my anxiety to worsen the day after consumption, so i stopped drinking it altogether\n5. Cannabis - may not be for everyone, but i use cannabis legally in my home and it has had very positive effects on my life\n\nThat's all! \ud83d\ude0a\n\nEdit: I am not denying that cannabis can in fact CAUSE anxiety to worsen in some people. It helps me, but for obvious reasons it is not for everyone and i don't claim it to be.\n\nEdit: For those interested, i also use a CBD Tincture on my bad days to help manage my anxiety without resorting to my xanax.",

The worst part is, i cant remember what its like to feel. memories are fading away and im just left with a vague husk of a memory. my memories are now chronologically twisting and turning together, my memory of yesterday is as vague as a memory from 2 years ago. im constantly confused and my reaction time has slowed which is not just hurting my emotional health, but my social life to. im even more awkward then i was before. i feel like im fine until i think about it, then i almost turn into different person who is aware of the situation and cant remember whats going on. please help. im sorry if this post sounded rambley. i just needed to get that off my chest..",

I can't sleep and I can't eat. I really can't do anything right now. I'm panicking really hard. Please. I'm so sorry. \n\nEdit: Thank you so much for all of the kind words and advice. I never thought so many people would respond to me or even care. I'm honestly so touched right now. It's Christmas Day, I'm crying super hard, and everything sucks, but everyone's kindness has made this so much better. Thank you so much. I can't even begin to express how much this means to me. ",
