A lot of my anxiety revolves around uncertainty and fear of losing control. I have a lot of what I've heard described as existential dread, and I've experienced agoraphobia and panic attacks off and on throughout my life at varying intensities.\n\nLast week when we met she basically told me that just b/c something is uncertain doesn't make it bad. Very simple statement but helped me a lot this week. \n\n:)",

            "selftext": "So be prepared for a HUGE wall of text. This isn't a throwaway account because I'm tired of hiding from this. Anxiety is a mental issue that people have been trying to bring to light (thankfully!). I would like to talk about my specific kind of anxiety. Everyone's fear, nerves triggers, and symptoms are different. Mine are very specific and I haven't attempted to get help until now. SPOILER ALERT: that was a mistake. \n\nMy family has a history of gastrointestinal problems. Although I don't always feel the family legacy, there are plenty of times I do. Sometimes, when in public or around people who don't know about it, I'm not in the best position to understand the plight of my family. I've had bad moments in long car rides or in situations where a bathroom isn't accessible. I'm sure we've all seen those commercials. While it isn't nearly as common for me, I've create a fun game for myself.\n\nSometimes, when I was in a bad position, I would begin to panic that those few moments from the past might happen now. I'm almost predisposed for it. My mother still struggles to this day. It's in the stars that I'll have a life of struggling with gastro health problems. This has caused me anxiety for the last 12 years. It was very manageable for awhile...in fact, I barely knew that's what it was.\n\nAnyone who has constant anxiety knows there are triggers (two to be exact). There's the first trigger that starts up the anxiety and ball of nerves you become. It could be a big test, a doctor's appointment, or being in large crowds. Then there's the second trigger that kickstarts your inevitable panic attack. That could be an answer on the test you actually don't know or a loud noise in the big crowd. It gets so bad you can actually see it coming, almost annoyed by its presence. Abdominal pains used to be my only trigger. Unless I was home or in a comfortable place, I'd start to get anxious and panic if I thought my gastro issues would show up. Left untreated, I developed the first trigger. Some PLACES would start to turn my stomach because I was afraid of what COULD happen (ex. cars, parties). If you haven't guessed, a car is my biggest trigger.\n\nNow, 12 years later, I find myself with what I call pre-anxiety. It's that knot of nerves in the pit of your stomach when you have a presentation or job interview. I have a long weekend trip next week. Every time I think about the four hour drive or various aspects of the agenda, I get that knot. I can usually make it go away, but I know I WILL panic on this trip...and that makes me a nervous wreck. Trust me, I don't want to be THAT person. People with anxiety would give their left leg to make it go away. It's something we feel burdened with. I'm seeing a psychologist on Monday to discuss my trip and more professional ways to deal with all this. And it will be the FRIST time I'm discussing this with a professional (never wait until your anxiety is CRIPPLING).\n\nFor now, I'm here because I've created a villain in my own life. And I know I'm not the only one. I refuse to not only pretend it doesn't exist, but continue to be embarrassed by it. I have anxiety due to gastrointestinal issues. And I will beat it. ",

            "selftext": "Happened in the Netherlands, Amsterdam.\n\nLast night I was with friends at the recordings of a local television show. When I was biking home to the student campus, I was on my own at that time, someone biked up from behind, stopped in front of me and took out a gun. \n\nI immediately stopped and raised my hands in the air. He wanted money so I gave him my wallet. There was 2,50 EURO in it so he asked for my pincode. I gave full cooperation while he also took my phone. I was forced to follow him and was told not to do anything stupid. We biked for about 2 km untill we got to an ATM. In the meanwhile he gave me back my wallet, asked me how much was on my bank account (answered I did not know) and said I needed to withdrawal 50 for him. \n\nAt the ATM, I withdrawed the money and stupiditly also went for the reciept, which I hid in my jacket. He told me to follow him some more. Asked me where I needed to go (gave vague directions \"Campus Southeast, which there are more of). I asked for my phone, because I had cooperated (don't know why...) and got it, if I promised not to call anyone. \n\nAt an intersection, he went left and send me right. Told me not to follow him, and that he would take measures if I did... I went right and biked for about 10 minutes before I had the guts to call my mother, a friend and 112 (police). \n\nNow, I have filed a report for street robbery, but also for being taken hostage. By law, it is forbidden to take someone, somewhere by force/threats by weapons. For a short amount of time, I was a hostage. \n\nI come by that area every single day. On the most diverse times. On tuesdays, it is around 3.45 AM for example. I am on the board of my study association so I often have weird schedules or events in the evenings nights. The road is basically the only one I can take without biking for 10 extra minutes and is not near much houses. \n\nRationally, I think I am safe now. I was at the wrong place at the wrong time with the wrong person. However, emotionally, I do not feel safe. I keep checking if passersby are the culprit of yesterday and I'm afraid to go there. Today I went there when it wasn't dark yet, but it just does not feel right... \n\nI was lucky. The thief was utterly stupid (why ask 50 and not try to max it out) and the weapon was probably fake. However, I'm scared shitless... ",

This whole week my anxiety has been extremely high, to the point that I wanted to cancel. This was an optional surgery, but something that will help me feel a lot more comfortable so I really wanted it. This morning I was expecting to have panic attacks the whole time when I was waiting to get put under. But I surprised myself. My heart rate was 120 so I was clearly anything but relaxed. Despite that black pit of fear ready to consume me, I did it anyway. I stuck it out. I didn't panic. I am sharing this because I am damn proud of myself and I also hope someone else can remember my story the next time something scary comes along. I was terrified and I did it anyway.

The combination ended up sending me on that lovely ride we all know and love on a daily basis. It wasn't until one of the doctors recommended I get labs drawn up. Of course I was low on vitamin D (living in the north west), but I was surprised to find out I was stupendously low on MAGNESIUM. This little bugger is responsible for helping in the function of over 300 systems in your body. Including your central nervous system. After my first 200mg, I felt the difference in less than 15 minutes. It was spectacular. I ended up buying a whole bottle and I haven't looked back since. I would say taking it regularly (200mg twice a day) has kept my anxiety at bay more than 80% of the time. As someone who's done the xanax thing, the hospital thing, the hermitting thing, and the full on avoidance of everything thing for about eight years, nothing has been more efficient for me than these tablets. I don't know if it will work for everyone, but I do know it worked for me. And if I can contribute to just helping one person away from this nightmare, this is totally worth sharing. \n\nLong story short: Magnesium glycinate helped me tremendously and I hope it helps some of you too.\n\nLink the the brand I use: http://www.amazon.com/Metagenics-Mag-Glycinate-Tablets-Count/dp/B004GLGXVO?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1&amp;redirect=true&amp;ref_=oh_aui_detailpage_o07_s00",

My sister is 16 and in high school. \n\nWhen I was 18 I started having severe issues with panic attacks and anxiety, I had to beg my mom to take me to the doctors. I was never taken seriously. I tried to tell my parents and was simply called lazy or was told to get over it. I stayed in my room for almost a year because it was so bad. I would sleep till 5 pm. My parents never did anything for me. They never tried to help me. \n\nRecently my sister who is 16 has been having issues with her teacher at school and has told my parents she had an anxiety attack in class from it. My parents were instantly concerned about her and my dad told her that they will talk to the school about it and try and get her out of that class. She is going to the doctor today because she revealed to my mom that she was so upset she thought about cutting herself. She has only had 2 anxiety related issues and my parents are doing everything they can to help her. \n\nI can't help but feel full of rage seeing this happen. Nothing was ever done for me. I was never taken seriously. I have self harmed multiple times. I know it's good that my parents are taking her to get help. But I can't help but feel so mistreated and angry. I never got any support from them. \n\nEdit: \nThank you for your replies. I'm happy to know I'm not alone in this. I am trying my best to not let these negative thoughts overpower me. I just can't help but feel so wronged by my parents. I have been writing in my worry diary every day. It helps but doesn't take away the feelings completely. I contacted the place I had a psychological assessment 4 years ago. They still have my record but they turned me away because my case wasn't urgent and it's something I have to go to my family doctor for. I finally want to get help because I feel scared and at the end of my rope. I want to talk to a professional about my problems. I was shocked when I was turned away. Does the noose have to be around my neck in order for me to get help? ",

Feeling sick or just not like myself triggers it too. I have nightmares about it. \n\nI practice mindfulness meditation, I'm on meds and I have an amazing therapist. I'm in the process of learning how not to fight the anxiety and the difficult feelings. It's incredibly hard. It's hard especially because when I do feel anxiety, I try SO HARD to use all of my skills to get rid of it, while at the same time knowing that fighting it does not work. It's very frustrating and scary to be caught in that place. \n\nSo anyway, hi, this is me trying to come to terms with the fact that yeah, I get anxious sometimes and yeah, I am imperfect and human and that's ok. All of you are too. It's ok not to be ok. \n",
