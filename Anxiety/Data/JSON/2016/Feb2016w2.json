I used to watch the History Channel and Discovery and stuff like that, and now all I watch is Adult Swim and cartoons. I mean, there's nothing WRONG with that. I just used to have a balance in my life. Now it seems like I can't bother booting up my brain or getting it to pay attention long enough to watch any of the educational programs I used to enjoy. I noticed when my boyfriend turns the TV on, it's How it's Made, or whatever he likes, but when I turn it on I automatically turn to cartoons or something lazy my mind doesn't really need to follow.

My biggest problem when I would get clean would be all of that anxiety coming back to the point where it would be hard for me to even order food from a drive through. So this time I began working on my self-esteem and I think I am making progress! I quit smoking cigarettes, started working out a little, and having small conversations with strangers or store clerks when I get the chance. I realize now that a lot of my social anxiety came from feeling alienated due to social stigmas placed on drug addicts.\n    \nI have been a long time lurker on Reddit and always afraid to post or comment. I would often begin to type things and then be afraid. I had such low self-esteem that I was afraid of what people over the internet would think of me who couldn't even see me! I'm proud to say that this past week I have been able to speak freely on here without getting nervous at all! I feel bad for those struggling with this as well but remember that it really can get better if you work hard at it. I may never be the most outgoing person in the world, and I know it might not seem like a big deal but it is to me. Any progress is a big deal!\n\n\n\nEdit: Thanks Everyone!

Don't get me wrong though, it was a great night and I had a shitload of fun but I just felt crap afterwards(I guess that's what anxiety does, huh?)\n\nAnyway, 2 days later today, I get these messages from my friend(whose birthday party it was)\n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/DOGw7tV.jpg\n\nI had to walk around grinning like a fuckwit. I'm so happy, I feel like I'm finally being who I wanted to be. I am just so over the moon, had to tell all you wonderful people.\n\nIt's been years of shit, but this stuff makes life worth living.

This is just something I have been doing lately and it has helped me so I wanted to share.\n\nIn those times when your anxiety is overwhelming and you're pacing the floor trying to get a handle on yourself, it's ingrained in us to try and calm yourself down by repeating, \"I'm OK. I'm OK.\" The problem is you're not OK, not even remotely, and this has always caused my panic to rise because it's not magically making be feel better and I'm not calming down. The more you focus on *not* calming down, the worse it gets.\n\nI've changed it to \"I'm *going* to be OK.\" which allows me to know that right now might suck and I'm having a hard time, but it' *is* going to pass and eventually I *will* be OK. Distract yourself if you can, but keep that mantra in the back of your head. Allow yourself to acknowledge that this shitty thing is happening, but it *will* end. Don't fight it - that will only exhaust you, ride it out as much as you can. This doesn't always work, sometimes the attack is just too damn strong, but give it a shot.",

            "selftext": "Backstory: I'm a 17 year old male. She's also 17. I asked her if she wanted to see Star Wars one week after it came out. (8 weeks ago) we planned to see it then that night she had to cancel. We rescheduled it for the next week. She canceled again. We rescheduled the next week for noon (I work evenings starting at 5 pm. She knew that) then she sleeps in until 2. I told her it could still work as I have freedom to be a little bit late. She decides it's not worth it then cancels again. Then as I get to work I check Twitter and can see she tweeted \"I just want to watch Star Wars\". I'm quite upset as she's making it look like my fault that we hadn't seen it. Then we scheduled to get lunch in two weeks (about a month ago at this point). As you probably guessed she canceled again. My mom tells me just to be done with her. I don't because she's the first girl to seem interested in me. The girl and I schedule dinner this time since I had the night off. She cancels 45 minutes before and it was getting late so I can't go with any friends. Then this weekend she came to me to schedule lunch today (Saturday) and she cancels because she doesn't feel well. I then see on her snapchat story that she is with friends. \n\nI'm now realizing that my mom was right about her. How do I go about telling her how I feel and see that it really hurt me without seeming rude?\n\n\nUpdate: I did it! It feels great to be able to stand up for myself for once. She was talking to a mutually friend saying I'm being dramatic(even though I gave her 8 2nd chances). I feel like I dodged a bullet.",

            "selftext": "I've always done this. When I was a kid I used to dream about being a part of the Harry Potter world. Back then it wasn't really a problem, or it wasn't bothering me. But now, it's becoming really annoying.\n\nIt's completely ridiculous. Right now I'm kinda alone so I mostly imagine a reality where I have a boyfriend. I'm having conversations in my head, arguments. Sometimes I imagine meeting his parents and reacting to situations that might occur. I imagine their personalities, what they think of me and how they react to me. \n\nSometimes it's my friends or people I know, sometimes it's some famous people I'm currently interested in - again, detailed conversations, situations.\n\nThe reason this is a problem is because I can't control it. It's too satisfying to be in this imaginary world that I just can't resist it. I can't pay attention in class, longer conversations with other people turn into me saying \"Can you repeat that?\" every couple of minutes. Studying is almost impossible - I actually failed this semester because I wasn't able to do a single exam. Before I go to sleep it's probably the most intensive, sometimes I have trouble falling asleep because I think too much.\n\nI'm going to see a therapist this Thursday but I fear I might fall back into an \"apathy state\" (which happens quite often) that basically makes me say fuck it, and during that time I'm not bothered by anything. If I was to see him right now I would say exactly this but I won't be able to in a couple of days...\n\nDoes anybody have a similar experience? What can I do to stop living a life that doesn't exist?",

I usually find myself sweating and then try to excuse myself to the bathroom for a moment but knowing some of my teachers, they don't allow students to leave the classroom for the toilet. And when I get told I can't leave I start feeling worse, mentally, emotionally and physically. \n\nI've been to the doctor in the last 6 months and was said to have some gastrointestinal problems where basically if I wasn't eating/digesting, the acid in my stomach would give me a burning sensation. But this is not the feeling I get when I feel anxious. Other than that the doctor said I was healthy young man and just needed to excercise some more.\n\nSeveral months have passed since then visiting the doctor and I still get regular upset stomachs now and don't know why. Logically I shouldn't be feeling anxious for anything, it's not like I come to school dreading an exam or something. I really shouldn't be feeling this way but unfortunately I do. General anxiety / anticipatory anxiety kinda sucks since I feel like I have to live my life around it :/\n\nThanks if anyone even bothered to read this. Just kinda needed to vent.\n\nEdit: Thanks to everyone that commented. I feel almost relieved after reading every comment knowing there are others that feel similar to what I'm experiencing. For now I'm going to research the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems, watch even more carefully what I eat, log my feelings leading up to the event and search for breathing techniques to help.",

I am also quite busy with school subjects I need to learn for my exams.\n\nHowever everyday around the last 4-5 hours of the day during the evening, I start to feel a sense of impending doom, like I am losing it and the world is collapsing. I don't know what is bothering me, I'm not sure if it's loneliness or something else. Am I not breathing right or something? I just feel like I can't withstand \"something\" anymore. Like it's all over.\n\nIt feels like I am about to perform in front of an entire crowd, but the feeling lasts for much longer with breaks in between. Sometimes even an hour. I don't understand the cause of this. Is this an anxiety disorder or a panic disorder? A panic attack? I am not shaking, I just feel pain in my stomach area. Very powerful butterflies.\n\nI don't understand why I feel like the entire world is ending when I have just been socializing.\n\nYesterday I felt like I was going to lose it, but I didn't so tomorrow I am going to call a therapist.",

            "selftext": "Hi guys,\nUp until last summer I had pretty severe anxiety. Not going to go into details, but life in general felt like wading through a river full of pirahnas, even though on the surface things were pretty good.\n\nSo I went to my counsellor to ask for CBT and whether I should go onto meds, and he said yeah, I should try both. So I did.\n\nThe first week on sertraline at 25mg, I felt so ill, dizzy, nauseous, anxious, everything, that eventually I called quits on my whole life, built a blanket form in my room with my xbox and stayed there for 3 days until I started to feel better. Then my doctor upped me to 50mg (as per standard procedure), which luckilly didn't make me ill again. 2 months later, I was feeling better, but still not brilliant, so my doc upped me to 100mg. Again, no significant illness on upping the dosage.\n\nI have now been on 100mg for almost 4 months, and I feel 600,000,000x better!!! I can live my life without constant terror and mental exhaustion, my relationship with my boyfriend has been better than it ever has (my anxiety was driving a wedge between us), and I am having minimal side effects.\n\nSide effects I am having are: \n1.) Increased UTIs -- not sure why, but in the first 3 months of going on I had 2 SEVERE UTIs within two weeks. This has settled down quite a bit, but I do get much more frequent twinges of pain down there than I ever used to.\n2.) Intolerance of salty foods?? Also not sure why. I've never been a very salty person, but since going on I have found I really really can't stand very salty things. I suppose it could just be related to being more thirsty. \n3.) Derealisation -- This is probably the most noticeable and affecting me. I frequently have the feeling like I'm not really living my life, or that I'm in a bit of a constant dream state. I often have to think hard about whether a memory was real or a dream.  This would be freaking me out more if a) my anxiety weren't so low ;) and b) i know that it is directly connected to the meds, and that I'll go back to normal when I hopefully come off in another few months.\n\nOverall, sertraline combined with some very successful CBT (I found that attention-training works really really well for me, and focusing on this is what I'm hoping will allow me to come off the meds) has changed my life, and after this stressful final year of uni I am very much hoping to hold on to these changes without the meds!!!\n\n....Although I was just awarded a place in a great PhD programme, so not so sure I'm gonna be stress-free for the next few years ;)",

I've had bouts of depression and other things. My anxiety, however, boomed when I hit puberty- I didn't want to go out, I felt odd, unaccepted and would constantly flake on people.\n\nI fought back for a while- I went to uni, made friends, graduated and got a good job. Now something happened at this job, I started to swallow really hard and loud. I was nervous being in an open office with new people. This hasn't stopped and I've been here a year. The past three months it's started to happen at home. Some days I'm in agonising pain and have to take my dads prescription acid tablets.\n\nI've tried ignoring it, calming myself down, making noise to mask it but it's got to the point where it's causing acid reflux, swollen throat, lack of saliva and nervousness around people when drinking/eating.\n\nI want to go to the Doctor, I want to work a way around dealing with this but I have no idea what to say or what to expect?\n\nAny advice would be greatly appreciated!",

I try to take it one day at a time, but with anxiety my worry often takes control and i get anxious about the future and if I'll always be strong enough to get through it forever.
