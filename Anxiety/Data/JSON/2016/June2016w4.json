            "selftext": "In general, there are 6 types of distorted thoughts that lead to anxiety.\n\nPersonally, being aware of these types of distorted thoughts helps me to identify which of my thoughts are anxiety and which of my thoughts are valid. Being able to identify anxious thinking is the first step in dealing with it. \n\n1) **Probability Overestimations**- Exaggerated beliefs about the chances of a negative event or outcome happening. \n\nExamples: Thinking that there is a high chance of dying in a plane crash. Assuming that your best friend doesn't like you anymore because they didn't respond to your text right away. Most \"What if...\" type thoughts. \n\n2) **All or Nothing Type Thinking**- Black/White thought patterns, judging everything as good or bad without recognizing that life is, in fact,  mostly \"grey area\". Judging something as negative when it is actually neutral. This type of thinking plays a big part for people that struggle with perfectionism. \n\nExamples: Interpreting someones neutral facial expressions as negative because they aren't obviously happy- \"If it's not positive than it must be negative\". -On diet&gt; eat cupcake&gt; think diet in now ruined&gt; proceed to eat entire XL pizza &amp; wings b/c your diet is \"ruined\" anyway due to the cupcake. \n\n3) **Catastrophic Thinking**- Exaggerating the importance of an event or outcome. (Not to be confused with point #1: probability overestimation, although the two are intimately related.) Underestimating your ability to cope in the unlikely event that the \"worst possible case\" does come true.  \n\nExample: \"If this first date doesn't go well I will probably die alone with 80 cats.\" When in reality, if the date doesn't go well it holds no power over the rest of your life. In reality, 5 minuets after the date is over, it doesn't matter anymore.\n\n\"It will ruin my life if my new coworkers don't like me\" When in reality, even if they hate you, you can always get a new job, or even be professionally successful without having a personal relationship with your colleagues. \n\n4) **Personalization**- Blaming yourself and only yourself for negative situations. \n\nExample \"That was an awkward conversation because I am awkward\". When in reality the other person has 50% responisibilty for the conversation.\n\n5) **Mind Reading**- Making assumption about what others think. \n\nExample: \"That server was a dick to me because she doesn't like me\" when in reality she was just in a bad mood because her husband cheated on her. \n\n6) **Selective Attention and Memory**- This is the tendency to focus on information that is consistent with your beliefs. If you believe that the world is dangerous or that people don't like you or that you are unworthy etc etc, your brain will pay attention to \"evidence\" that is consistent with your beliefs. Kind of like how you always notice cars on the road that are the same as yours. \n\nExample: You notice the 3 people who you perceived to look negative during your presentation and ignore the 15 that looked positive or neutral. Or worse, you perceived the neutral to be negative (see point #2).\n\nWhat types of distorted thinking do you engage in the most? What are some specific examples? \n",

A small thing will happen, and my paranoia will set in ultimately convincing me that I am going to die. \n\nI had a pain in my chest when I woke up. Anxiety immediately says, \"You're having a heart attack; you'll probably die.\" But knowing that it's probably just gas, I kept repeating, \"We're not gonna do this today. You're probably fine, and not gonna die.\"\n\nSurprisingly, this worked! I also kind of just accepted my death, just in case. But here I am, alive and well.

Anxiety can be really tough to endure and you may have a hard time thinking of something else, but whenever you're having anxiety just think of this quote and hopefully it can help keep you grounded.\n\nEDIT: a lot of people are posting saying that this quote is bullshit and that it won't actually help anyone with anxiety. Obviously I didn't post this thinking \"people are going to read this quote and their anxiety will vanish!\" It's meant to be a simple observational quote that may help you think of the reality of the situation. It's not meant to instantly make your anxiety go away, or even to help it in some cases. I thought it was a nice quote worth sharing.

In fact I used to have a job where I made phone calls every single day. But in the last few years I have mostly avoided making them (asking others to call for me when there was no email option for example).\n\nI have milder (but still bad) fears about people knocking on my front door, and answering phone calls, but nothing like how I feel about having to make phone calls of my own. Yesterday someone asked me if I could make a phone call for them today while they're at work, and I forced myself to agree. I wish I just said no. My day has been completely ruined by worrying about making this phone call. It's come to the point now where I'm running out of time and I still can't do it. I'm sitting here with the phone beside me and my heart racing at a million miles every time I go to pick it up. I don't know what's wrong with me or where it came from.",

            "selftext": "I'll keep it as short and sweet as possible. I texted my therapist yesterday at 6:50 asking if we could find a time next week to meet. I put my phone down and leave the room for about 5 minutes. Within that time he's called me twice and left two text messages, one saying \"I'm going on vacation next week can you call me immediately?\" and one three minutes later that said \"Guess not.\" Before I get a chance to even look at my phone he calls me again, I don't recognize his number right off because I don't have it saved as a contact and I accidentally answer then reject the call. Then he texts me \"U just hung up on me\" and I finally read all the other texts and stuff. His prices are very high. I didn't like how within three minutes he replied with a snarky remark, maybe thats petty. I just told him not to worry about it and to enjoy his vacation. He didn't get the hint, called me like two more times and texted me to say I had to call him to make an appointment (I generally let my Dad handle the scheduling because he helps me pay for my sessions). I said plainly as possible I didn't want to schedule an appointment anymore and to please stop calling my phone. He told me he would \"tell my father about this\". I'm 20 years old, I get that I look very young, but I took offense to this comment. I also felt it damaged the integrity of the privilege I'm supposed to have as one of his clients, it felt like he was threatening me with the only thing he had because I did something he didn't agree with. All of this unfolded in the span of 10 minutes. Was I too reactionary in how I handled this? Am I being petty? Its just I have another therapist I often see who would never do something like this, and I'm confused. \n\nedit: I got a ton of responses to this post I didn't expect. It seems to be unanimous that this was bad business by my therapist. I appreciate everyone's comments. Sorry I couldn't reply to everyone. ",

            "selftext": "I'm not sure why I'm posting this. But it's 4am here and it's another sleepless night for me. I can't sleep through a night  and have at least 2 nights a week with literally 0 hrs  of sleep. I simply cannot handle my brain not shutting up. Only times I ever feel calm anymore is if I take a sedative and then feel loopy for a while which I hate. I've tried to fake it till I make it per say. Try really hard to be happy until I become happy but  I can't do it. Technically my life is 100 times better than it has been in the past having lived  in unsafe places and rough conditions. I have amazing friends and family...some of the best people in the world. And I cannot stop being scared  of how they will suffer one day, pass away etc. \nI'm completely stuck and I just want it to end. I'm tempted to just stay home or somewhere and try to live out the rest of my life as I don't want to commit suicide or anything like that because I'm too scared and I don't want to hurt anyone. Basically I don't want to live and I'm too scared to die and I don't know what the alternative is anymore. I'm just so tired.  \nMy spouse always tells me, worry when shit hits the fan....and it makes sense to me (he's the greatest soul btw). Why am I spending beautiful days scared of what ifs. And it makes sense for brief periods of time and I have clarity and peace for a few mins but it never ever lasts. But I also find it hard to believe that my anxiety is an imbalance...It feels like it's very real considering how horrible the world is and how much suffering happens...why shouldn't I be anxious.  It makes me sad that my parents did everything and sacrificed everything with the main goal being their children's happiness yet I can't be happy...I just fake it. \nSo I guess with this incoherent rant I'm just looking for some words of wisdom and comfort. I don't like talking about this to a lot of other people in my life as unfortunately a lot of them are dealing with their own huge stressors and I feel bad complaining to them...thank God for the Internet where I can just post a random rant  and vent",

            "selftext": "Hi everybody. I really need help. I've been meaning to post about this for a while and I haven't been able to get myself to do it, and you'll see why if you read on. \n\nThank you to anybody who actually reads this. Please help me. I'm desperate. \n\nSo I'll tell you what my life situation is currently, and hopefully someone will be able to help me. \n\nI'm currently on summer break from college. I'm living with my dad. My dad and I have a pretty good relationship for the most part but for some reason talking to him really stresses me out lately. He never (read: very often) understands what I'm trying to say, and talking to him always (read: often) makes me feel worse. He always assumes that I don't know what I'm talking about, which is really insulting and just makes me feel really frustrated. Obviously I've tried talking to him about all this many times but he doesn't really listen or it has no effect. \n\nI don't have any friends here. And even my dad is gone most of the day on most days, so I rarely talk to anybody and am alone with my thoughts most of the time. \n\nSo here's the main reason I wanted to write this: My anxiety keeps me from doing anything that gives me joy. The main thing that I really enjoy is watching movies. I'm probably the biggest film buff you've ever met. I get so much spiritual fulfillment and joy from an amazing movie. You have to understand this because it's very different from how a lot of people just kinda half-assedly watch netflix to entertain themselves and kill time and then a month later don't even remember the title of the movie. This is different: it is my passion.\n\nBut my anxiety keeps me from watching movies. I compulsively worry about not having the perfect movie-watching experience. I'm worried that I'm going to ruin it. I know logically that this is absurd but as you guys know that doesn't mean shit. I worry about worrying and this keeps me so in my head that I can't even keep my attention on the movie and completely zone out and miss it and therefore ACTUALLY DO ruin it. It's a self-fulfilling prophecy. It's an impossible dilemma. \n\nI am literally constantly \u2013 I'm going to say it again \u2013 CONSTANTLY worrying about stuff. I worry about getting worried. I'm so busy worrying all day that I can't even devote my attention to anything. \n\nIt keeps me from doing anything productive too but what bothers me most is that it ruins everything I try to do to relax or have fun. I can't relax or have fun anymore. I want to cry but I can't do that either. I feel trapped and unable to do anything. I feel like the pressure keeps building and building and never lets off and I'll never explode or somehow feel better. \n\nI feel so claustrophobic. Even in my room with the door closed I feel like I can never be alone and have peace. \n\nI currently have a house in the town where I go to college. My housemate and best friend is already living there. I could be living there right now but the reason I'm here is that my parents just got divorced last year and my dad is not doing so well and it really comforts him to hang out with me. I NEED to get out of this house. I know that if I went to live with my best friend in my own house I would feel so much better, but I feel like I can't because of my dad. \n\nBut the longer this goes on and the worse it gets the more I think I need to just do this for myself. My dad doesn't know what I'm going through. I feel like a caged animal. But god I would feel really bad to leave my dad. \n\nAnyway I didn't just write this to talk about whether I should move out or not. Even when I'm out of the house and living with my best friend/roommate my anxiety is definitely better, but still bad. However I do think I'll talk to my dad about this when he gets home. God he might be mad or really sad though. I guess I'll just try to tell him everything I said here except leave out the stuff about him. \n\nI know you guys will try to say to just work out the communication issues with my dad but I've been trying for years and he just doesn't get it so that is not the solution. Obviously nothing is impossible but some things are very implausible. Just take my word on this. \n\nI'm super lonely too. I know it's a clich\u00e9 but no one understands me. I have good friends and a good dad but I still don't have anybody I can be really open with. I really just want more than anything else to have someone to love. I just mean a really close friend \u2013 no possibility of a girlfriend. I feel like that would make all of this other shit bearable and I would be able to handle it. I've posted this before and people tell me to love myself. I try but I can't really do it. I know it will probably come in time but right now I just can't see it. \n\nPeople on reddit tell me to go out and do shit in the community but \n1) I can't drive. I have no idea why. I've been driving with someone else in the car for 5 years and hundreds upon hundreds of hours but I still can't drive for shit. I have no idea why. I have an appointment with some kind of brain doctor in a few days to see if we can figure out what's wrong with me.\n2) What the fuck would I do? Pottery? I've never played and have no interest in sports.\n3) Why would the people there be any different? What are the chances I'm going to meet someone there who could be my best friend?\n\nBesides, I already know what my passion is. I love movies and my dream is to make them myself. I know I can do it. But right now I'm stalled. I need to get this 3-minute short done by August 10. I've never done this before so I'm nervous about it, even while at the same time being very excited and optimistic. I don't know what it's going to be about so I've got to figure that out. \n\nPeople tell me to get a new hobby or exercise or meditate or do any number of things and I really really try to but I'm just too fucking stressed to get myself to do anything. My anxiety totally paralyzes me and keeps me from doing anything at all. Especially things which are supposed to be pleasant and fun. I really need to solve the anxiety problem first. Telling me about things I could do doesn't help if my anxiety completely keeps me from doing them. \n\nPeople also tell me I should be on medication but that's not an option. \n\nI guess I could try to find another therapist but I just kinda think it's bullshit. But my school offers some free counseling so once school starts back up I'll do that again. \n\nSo I guess that's all I had to say. Thank you to anyone who reads this. I appreciate any help I can get. ",
