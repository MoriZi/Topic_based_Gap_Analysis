            "selftext": "Lately my anxiety has been terrible but I've been managing with therapy, meds, and a benzo (only .5mg) when it gets real bad. It's really hindered my drive to go out and I can feel underlying agoraphobic that I'm desperately fighting to not let win. \n\nAnyway there was this huge Miata meet today that I had been planning on going to for months. The thought of not going crossed my mind many times this morning but I remembered something my friend and psychologist said which is just do what you would have done before the anxiety started, so I went. \n\n40 minute drive later I was one of the first cars there, these random guys that were behind me most of the way there parked next to me and started talking to me immediately and I think that broke the ice. There were over 150 cars and I walked around the entire time, never once did I feel panic, need to go to a quiet space for a second, and my worst fear, having to leave early. I was totally fine and calm once I got there and started walking around. What was even better is that I talked to so many random people! I was there by myself and figured I wouldn't talk to many people but I found myself going over to people and asking about their cars or them asking about mine. I was pretty much talking to a random person at all times for over 4 hours. I met a lot of great people and stayed until the very end with only minor anxiety. \n\nSure the benzo did help but lately even with that pill I've been struggling a lot, especially in social situations where I used to thrive. Still, I don't even remember myself being this social before my anxiety got worse, so that's awesome. Just wanted to share, that anxiety can be beat, wish you all the best. \n\n[Bonus pic of my car today, it's the red one](http://i.imgur.com/q782d2y.jpg)",

            "selftext": "A few days ago I picked up a book at a discount store about positive psychology (the study of how people with optimal mental health live their lives), didn't think much about it, but started reading. I came across something called ['defensive pessimism'](http://academics.wellesley.edu/Psychology/Norem/Quiz/quiz.html). A defensive pessimist is someone (who typically has anxiety) who can easily imagine the different ways things can go wrong. For them, lowering anxiety involves ruminating about all the worst case scenarios and preparing/bracing for them. Crucially, *not* thinking about the worst-case scenario and setting positive or high expectations about the situation they're anxious about actually *raises* their anxiety levels. \n\nThen we have the strategic optimist (people who typically don't have anxiety problems). For them, the opposite's true. If they dwell too much on worst-case scenarios, their anxiety increases.\n\nI'm, quite clearly, a defensive pessimist. I hate people telling me that something's unlikely to happen, because in my mind, there's *always* a chance that something bad's going to happen, no matter how small. And I wasn't a fan of CBT for this reason, though there are some techniques that might be useful, the majority of it was like, \"oh that's unlikely\", \"you're catastrophizing\", \"stop expecting the worst!\". And it just didn't fucking work. Now I know why.",

My gf was studying abroad for 2 and a half months, and we were definitely having some rocky moments, but I figured once she got back everything would be okay. I knew that things were different about a month or so ago when she stopped supporting me as much and being there for me when I was in need. Today we talked on the phone while I was at work and she broke up with me. I was kind of expecting it but it still feels like I was blindsided by it. I knew that we had our issues with me always wanting to stay in and her always wanting to go out and drink, but this summer I started therapy and medication and I'm living with some new guys next year that I think I can actually be friends with. So I thought I was making at least some progress and that we would work this out like we always do, but I guess not. I could really use some kind words.\n\nTL;DR: I have bad anxiety and depression and no friends at school and my gf broke up with me today\n\n\nEdit: Thank you everyone for your support. It means a lot to me. I'm still pretty broken up (no pun intended) about it, but what I miss the most is simply the companionship and having someone by my side, and I'm just really going to miss that. Plus she was my only friend at an out of state college and I'm just really scared to go back in less than a month now. But thank you for all of your nice comments, it helps. :)",

            "selftext": "my life story;\n\nSo I developed pretty late. From grades 6-11 I was ugly, I had a chubbyish face, wasn't fat but was very untoned, and was very awkward looking. I got bullied a lot back then and I remember I used to hide sometimes in toilets to avoid getting picked on. I only remember how much I was bullied when one of my highschool friends brings it up as a joke when are meeting up. I used to feel inherently uncool, like I could never have good friends, that no chill person would want to be my friend. \n\nin about 11th grade my face shed of its fat, my jawline came through, and I became really good looking. I was still bullied in grade 11 because I had become a target almost, people said I was easy to target because It was like after the years of bullying, my balls were gone, I became a bitch, they had bullied my confidence/self esteem right out of me. \n\nThen I went to college and tried to be a completely different person, tried to get my mental/outlook frame to and on par with the other good looking people. it worked on the odd times and people used to treat me much differently to school. But I could never make moves properly on girls/was kind of awkward and couldn't talk well and confidently with people even tho It was starting to piece togather.\n\nI realised these good looking people around me had been like that since they were so young, but for me it was like being born again, I didn't know how to act/do things, I always felt no one really liked me and always felt I was being used in some way or form.\nI smoked weed  and that made me even more paranoid, I used to feel I was ugly and my good looks were an illusion, that everyone was making fun of me and I was worthless.\n\nIn college I made quite a few friends but ofc never ever spoke about my past. To them I was this good looking guy who seemed to be a bit arrogant even, and quiet, and even not that smart. My looks were there, but the personality was lacking far far behind. How could I make up in 1-2 years for what others spent their entire youth mastering? \n\nI read everything I could, how to win friends and influence people etc.. I became better with girls quite a lot but I still am awkward in person a lot of the time, they just dont percieve me as an awkward guy because of how I look. I just come across as someone who is a bit full of himself or something. I've been called an asshole quite a few times for that. Sophomore year I became better, I began to realise weed was no good for me, I realised that my friends liked me for who I was, and that the silliness I had from highschool, was still there, I began to study more and showed my intelligent side (I go to a highly ranked university). I began to smile, appreciate others, care to make good friends. The fear of people no liking me based on how I look is going. I am still pretty self conscious which is something I need to erradicate as soon as possible. \n\nI'm entering my junior year at college, with set goals. I need to 1) lose my virginity 2) get a beautiful girl as my girlfriend. I've never had a girlfriend, the thought of rejection would have buried me with my low self esteem and extreme boughts of anxiety.\nTHe anxiety tells me I am worthless, that I will never get a girlfriend, that such things are not for people like me, its terrible, I can often not sleep and toss and turn a lot. Im still very insecure about my looks, I look in the mirror a lot to check if I look half decent. many people think I am a narcissist or something because of it.\n\nI wish  I could download all the experiences other guys had during highschool, and college, and be able to feel that different mental/frame outlook. It must feel so great to believe so many girls are into you, to have that mental outlook of confidence, to know u can always do and achieve, and get beautiful girlfriends.\n\nI know this is impossible, and I will HAVE to have these experiences. Wisdom/experience cannot be derived from books, and only experience. I know I must fail a bunch more times with girls quickly before I succeed. The Anxiety bouts I have at times are severe. I don't take any medications tho nor do I want to ever. I get depressed and look around my room or wherever I am to things I can use or where I can hang myself. end my poor little life.\n\nI have to convince myself I am good looking again, I am worth a lot, its my own mental frame that is fucking me over, crippling me, that I have so many friends who are very cool at university who I could be even better friends with, I could play less games with girls and be open/honest and genuine with them. I just fucked it up with a girl I had a huuuge crush on and that is killing me rn, and has been for the last few days. I feel so shit, the anxiety is ruining me. \n\nI have a shredded/muscluar body, I'm a pretty short guy at 5'8 but I've learned that is inconsequential as it is the confidence that comes with height that is so attractive (tho I know height is much sexier). I have a face like a less hot more cute version of Zayn Malik.\n\nBut this past month I stopped working out, began smoking a lot when the anxiety trips were high. my diet got shit.\nI still look the same, I haven't lost any of my gains/look very fit, but I am weaker. I've stopped smoking so much now only like a cigarette a day and I'll get over this girl soon.\n\nJunior year is where I want to come in strong, use all my wisdom from the last 2 years and realise my potential. to make all the moves I can with girls, be fun, be genuine, accept myself for whatever I am, be happy, smile, show interest in others, and accept that I am a good looking guy, I am very very lucky to look and have the life that I do, and if my mental frame is gonna keep fucking me, its not acceptable. I am still a slave to my anxiety but I am fighting, each day I tell myself don't just don't start the thought cycle where I am useless etc..\n\nSorry for this long essay to those of you who stuck around to read my life story.",

My doctor gave me a perscription of 10mg of Celexa to be taken every day and .5 mg of Larazapan to be taken as needed. I've also been seeing a psychologist once a week. \n\nHowever since the last week of June (when this flared up) it's been hell. I've had to take a benzo pretty much every 24 hours to even pull myself out of bed or eat anything. Every day I've tried to push farther without the benzo but I've had to give in and take it, until today!\n\nI successfully have gone over 24 hours without taking a benzo and feel pretty good! Granted today was a really chill day: I accidentally slept like 10 hours, it was my day off, and all I did was drive around a bit, but it was also in the high 90s and I've been planning some stuff for the weekends, both of which have been setting off my panic lately. \n\nI'm not sure if it's the Celexa working (doc said 6-8 weeks for it to work, it's only been 3) or the CBT skills kicking in, but I'm really glad I got through today without one. In not against medication at all but I've heard benzos aren't something you want to be on long term. \n\nGood luck everyone!",

I've had only one panic attack since I started taking it and I've been sleeping better, though if I take too much I feel even more tired. But anyway, the point of this post is that the other symptoms are still there and I don't know what to do about them.\n\nI still feel very forgetful and unable to focus. If someone tells me something at work, I'll have to ask them to repeat it five minutes later. I still have to ask the same question every day because nothing seems to stick. I can almost feel sentences going in one ear and straight out the other. I used to be a top student and have a razor sharp memory so it's more than a little frustrating. I'm still constantly anticipating the worst too, thinking that every mistake I make is going to get me fired, but it's not accompanied by the usual heart palpitations/shaking/nausea.\n\nI feel like if I can just conquer this \"mind blank\" problem, it'll be a huge step forward and would make so many of the other issues I've been dealing with easier to manage too.

Trying to rationally disprove your thoughts or the lack of logic behind your compulsions will just lead to more doubt and questioning.\n\nMeanwhile, a common CBT exercise for Generalized Anxiety Disorder suggests that you make a list of \"Automatic thoughts\" and counter each thought with a \"Rational response\". e.g., \"Automatic thought - my boss will fire me. Rational response - it was a small mistake, Phil in accounting did the same thing and no one cared, I'll probably be fine.\"\n\nAs someone with comorbid OCD and GAD, sometimes I have worries that are overtly one or the other, but sometimes there's an overlap. So I'm not too sure what to do in those situations. \n\nNot really sure what my point is here, just wondering if anyone else has noticed this. ",
