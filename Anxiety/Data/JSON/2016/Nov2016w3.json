            "selftext": "I\u2019m not a doctor. Simply compiling everything that\u2019s been helpful for my anxiety and wish someone had told me this information years ago. I\u2019ve posted this on a few other threads but wanted as many people to see it as possible. Apologizing in advance for formatting and length. But please give it a go. Some of the information could be really helpful!\n\nBackground: Got diagnosed with GAD and OCD a while back and have been dealing with anxiety as far back as I can remember. Was on 10mg of Lexapro once a day for a year and a half. While it helped me get through some really tough life shit, the withdrawal, in my opinion, was not worth it. However, this isn\u2019t the case for everyone so do what feels right for you! Anyways, here\u2019s the meat:\n\n1) Diet \n-Cutting out processed sugars and starches has made a huge difference. I've noticed that when I consume said foods, my anxiety \"brain fog\" and depersonalization/derealization gets significantly worse. However, starches can be hard to give up completely. As a fellow carbosaurus, I understand the struggle. I found that replacing white bread with wheat bread has really helped. Wheat pasta is a good substitute too, and there isn\u2019t (in my opinion) a huge taste difference. Also, brown rice instead of white rice. White rice has a high glycemic index and can spike your blood sugar, which leads me to my next point --&gt;\n\n-Low blood sugar can play a huge part in anxiety. Snacking on protein rich foods every few hours can help this. I carry around a bag of bulk cashews to snack on in case I can\u2019t access other food. Most grocery stores now offer those one-serving packets of peanut butter and almond butter, which are so convenient to carry around with you. Slim enough for a pocket even!\n\n-Speaking of sugar, even artificial sweeteners (Sucralose, Saccharin, etc.) have been shown to heighten anxiety. These can be found in diet sodas, low fat foods, gum, and even dairy items to name a few. Honey or agave nectar can be good substitutes. BONUS: Consuming local honey exposes you to allergens in your area, which can help with allergies!\n\n-Eliminating all beverages except water. Caffeinated and/or sugary drinks are basically the devil when it comes to anxiety so I'd cut back on those if it's hard to eliminate all together. \n\n-Alcohol and other drugs can cause anxiety to soar. I've noticed after a night of drinking my depression and anxiety sky rockets.\n\n-Daily Omega. I take two Omega 3-6-9 blend fish oil pills every day and can notice a difference if I don't take them for a week. \n\n-Magnesium glycinate supplements have been said to work for a lot of people. Be careful though because certain magnesium supplements can cause explosive diarrhea\ud83d\udca9\n\n-There\u2019s still debate on this one but salt. Apparently in the refining process of table salt, it gets stripped of minerals and trace elements. Pink Himalayan crystal salt contains 84 minerals and trace elements. Some people even add a tiny sprinkle to their water bottle every day. If you want to try this, be careful not to overdo it as salt can cause uncomfortable bloating.  \n\n2) Meditation CAN'T SAY THIS ENOUGH \n\n-No exaggeration, this in combination with a fixed diet has been my savior. I feel so good I can't go back to living without meditation. \n\n-You don't have to be a guru hippy Mother Earth child to benefit from meditation or even learn how to meditate. There is an app called Headspace that provides excellent guided meditation highly recommended \n\n-Another user told me about an app called Breathe. From what I've read it's provided people with relief and is a great meditation tool. I\u2019d recommend looking into both Headspace and Breathe, as people will always have a preference.\n\n-Guided meditations are great but it's important to know how to meditate in silence as well (you won't always have access to your smart phone for a meditation app). When I do this I set a timer for 10 minutes on my phone. I'll take five deep breaths (in through nose, out through mouth) and then close my eyes on the last breath out. Begin to breathe normally. I'll then focus on my breaths, counting to ten, and then start back at one. Side note: It's okay to lose focus! And tell yourself that when you realize you're not counting breaths anymore. \"Oh, my mind went off track and that's okay. I'm going to focus on my breaths again\" and resume counting. I've been meditating for six months now and still get sidetracked frequently.\n\n-Simple breathing. Whenever I feel the anxiety/nervousness/worry/etc. increasing, I'll go to the bathroom or another private place where I can sit in silence and count my breaths. This works as a good checkpoint through out the day, as I can try to \"refocus\" my mind.\n\n3) Therapy \n\n-Yay therapy! I\u2019ve been in therapy for the past 13 years. It has literally saved my life countless times. Therapy is beneficial for EVERYONE, especially those of us who suffer from anxiety. \n\n-I know some people have a hard time fitting therapy into their schedules or due to financial reasons (right there with you). A quick google search of \"best online counseling services\" ought to do the trick.\n\n-Not sure how it is in other countries but in America most colleges (and probably some high schools) provide free counseling services. These are real counselors and legally cannot contact your teachers, peers, or employers. Also, if you are nervous about your peers seeing you at the counseling center, think about that for a second. You are seeing them at the counseling center. Chances are they are also there for counseling. This can create an immediate and intimate bond between you guys, and maybe even someone to talk to about what's going on in your head. \n\n-For those afraid or who get anxiety about going to a counselor/therapist: Therapists are genuinely caring people. Most of them became therapists because they themselves have struggled with some sort of mental illness and/or a traumatic event. And they are legally required to maintain the integrity of your conversations, meaning they won\u2019t talk to people in your life or others about what you say. Everything you say is confidential. (That is unless you talk about harming yourself or others). I cannot stress how wonderful it feels to have someone in your life whose sole purpose is to listen to you vent about your feelings. One of our basic needs as humans is to feel heard. When we get that need met, we feel acknowledged and loved. This can mean all the world when it feels like no one in your life listens and/or understands the intensity of your anxiety. \n\n4) Journaling\n\n-Bring that pen to paper and vomit out all of your fears, angers, frustrations, sorrows, etc. Sometimes our anxiety gets stuck, and when we give it an outlet, it can make all the difference. \n\n-Writing virtually is good but I\u2019ve found that the act of physically writing out my emotions is so meaningful, and I feel a higher connection with my mental and emotional body.\n\n-In a previous thread I posted this information in, some people mentioned they didn\u2019t like reading their emotions because it made them feel guilty, angry, etc. It is okay to feel these emotions! BURN THE PAPER. Seriously. Burn. That. Shit. Up. Tear it up. Watch it go through a shredder. This is therapeutic! Feel like I have to say this\u2014make sure if you do decide to go the burn route that you do it outside in a receptacle that can handle the heat! \n\n5) Podcasts \n\n-There are a number of very helpful anxiety podcasts. I'd recommend The Anxiety Coach's Podcast. There are two new episodes each week (Wednesdays and Sundays) that somehow relate to anxiety. The host provides listeners with MANY tools for helping with anxiety, as well as an extremely diverse range of topics. I've found that even episodes I don't think apply to my anxiety have always consisted of useful information and helpful tricks.\n\n-Other good podcasts include Anxiety Slayer, Anxiety Guru, The Anxiety Podcast, and The Anxiety Guy. Just like the meditation apps, give them all a try! If you don\u2019t like one you\u2019ll probably like another one more\n\n6) Exercise \n\n-GO OUTSIDE. Studies have proven time and time again that even just sitting in nature and hearing the sounds it has to offer lower cortisol levels (stress hormone) \n\n-Yoga. Any type is beneficial! I've found the most anxiety relief from Restorative Yoga. The whole class consists of three poses (they aren't super complex yogi stances, usually lying on your back in a certain way) \n\n-Cardio is great for \"happy\" hormone production. \n\n-It's important to note which types of exercise make YOU feel good, as it's not the same for everyone. For example, running is great for you but if it's physically hurting your knees, ankles, etc. it's probably not the best for you. There's always a different form of exercise, and fortunately all types of exercise result in decreased anxiety! Any type of movement is better than no movement when it comes to anxiety :)\n\n7) Medication\n\n-Anxiety can be fucking torture. There is nothing worse than feeling like a prisoner to your own mind. Medication can definitely help soften this, especially if you are feeling like you can no longer go on.\n\n-Research your options. Talk to people you know who are taking something about what they like/don\u2019t like about being medicated. Read reviews. Read side effects (this might not be helpful if you are extremely prone to the placebo effect or have health anxiety).\n\n-READ ABOUT WITHDRAWAL. Once again, I am all for medication if you feel it is right for you. When I decided to go on Lexapro, I was 100% sure I wanted to. What I do regret is not researching withdrawal. Not only did I experience two weeks\u2019 worth of physical symptoms (night sweats, racing heart) but also experienced severe depression and anxiety that was far worse than what I\u2019d experienced before going on it. I also have social anxiety now which I didn\u2019t have before. Anyways, the point of this is to research, research, research, and know your options!\n \n8) Random \n\n- \"You Are the One\" by Kute Blackson is an inspirational read for anyone with anxiety \n\n-Posture makes a difference. Sitting up straight builds self-confidence and becomes easier with time \n\n-Write down quotes or phrases or mantras or whatever makes you feel good and hang them up in places where you\u2019ll see them frequently. Bathroom mirrors and inside front door are two really good places I utilize regularly. You can even write down reminders of why you\u2019re working on your anxiety.  \n\n-PM me if you ever need someone to talk to! I\u2019m in the process of becoming a therapist myself so please please please contact me if you need to talk. I will not judge you and love to listen. Anxiety doesn\u2019t need to be a social taboo. \n\nIt's important to note that working on your anxiety is a process. There's not one thing that is a magic cure-all. You'll have great days, weeks even, and then not-so-great days. It's crucial to remember that the down days don't last forever. And as a reminder, be extremely gentle with yourself. It is okay to feel other emotions besides happiness. This may sound weird but welcome them. Allow them to be. The more you resist them the harder and stronger they\u2019ll come back. \n\nOnce again, please feel free to PM me if you need to talk/vent. Best of luck to you on your journey and thanks for reading!",

Some people were talking about how much they \"hate\" their part-time jobs, and as I was thinking that at least they can have a job and not be miserable, my teacher basically brought that up. It was kinda out of the blue. But here's what she said:\n\n\"Well, I mean, there are some people with social anxiety who just can't do those sorts of things. They really want to spend time with people but it has to be on their own terms. And then, because of that, they have to be alone a lot of the time and it makes them really sad.\"\n\nAnd the whole room just fell silent. I'm sitting there, staring at nothing, letting all of it sink in with me, trying not to cry. But that's the first thing that's given me a feeling of actual sadness in a long time. So that's good.\n\nAnyways, it was a weird and depressing experience. And I felt really frustrated afterwards, but I'm not really sure why. Maybe I was mad at myself, or maybe I wanted to stand up and raise both hands and say, \"Yup, that's me.\" I think it was just hearing my own thoughts out loud that got to me that most.\n\nBut yeah. Just thought I'd share.\n\n",

It causes stress beyond proportions.\n\nI'm only getting 3-5 hours of sleep a night.. I can't understand how I've not snapped yet.. there's just so much build up from my thoughts. I wish I had an off switch. My first response would be \"ahhh\" relief. I've tried explaining to my fianc\u00e9 but it's probably hard to understand something you don't experience.

It might be a bit long, so thank you for giving me a few minutes of your time.\n\nI'm a long time sufferer of anxiety. I remember being a child and having the same feeling in my stomach as my anxiety gives me now. Back then I called it a tummy ache and it's been with me ever since. I never had many friends when I was a kid. I was slightly bullied (the way girls do, by just freezing you out).\n\nI suck at social interactions and have a really hard time connecting with people (unless it's about to become a real, sexual relationship. I can do those. I CAN connect to my family as well). I have (had?) friends but my anxiety combined with depression makes me isolate myself and I leave my friends on the outside of my bubble. I don't reach out to them because I don't want to bother them and to be honest I don't have the energy to do shit in real life right now. I'm working on getting better and it takes a lot of my time. \n\nAnyways, most people with social anxiety seem to be able to make internet friends. I've never been able to. I can't get over the fact that people online are actually real people with real thoughts and feelings. I need to talk to people other than my SO and my closest family, but I'm too afraid to. I want friends tho. I want people to talk to that I enjoy talking to instead of trying to figure out what they really think of me.\n\nAnyone who knows what I'm talking about? Or does anyone have any suggestions on how to make some nice internet or real life friends? I've played MMOs but I never talk to people on there either. I always feel like I'm the odd one out when it comes to other people and I just don't know how to reach out...",

I've encountered establishments before that didn't have full knowledge of ADA law but were more understanding once they realised, but this is the first time I've actually had a place refuse my service animal because it was \"bad for their business\". They were really condescending about it too and honestly didn't give a crap whether it was discrimination or not. \n\nI argued for a long time. I've already filed an ADA complaint and written on their social media pages. It gave me so much anxiety that I couldn't sleep until after 6 AM, but I'm proud of myself for standing up for my own rights and against discrimination. \n\nEdit: She IS a service animal. I have anxiety but that isn't what she is trained for. I know ESAs aren't covered by the ADA. \n\nEdit 2: I was avoiding having to explain why I need her, but apparently people really want to know. She is a psychiatric medical response service animal for panic attacks. I have a long history of panic attacks (since mid-teens) stemming from violent trauma issues from my childhood, which is both a mental and physical event. I've been told it's PTSD but I don't get flashbacks, just panic attacks and intrusive thoughts. I have had to admit myself to the emergency room/urgent care for the severe ones. Now I have daily medication on top of emergency, strong prescribed medication, and my service animal, who is trained to deal with me during my panic attacks. I try to carry my emergency medication with me, but it becomes less effective with more use and is known to be addictive, so I am not given a lot of it. \n\nPeople were very concerned that I was trying to be vague to the establishment. I wasn't. I told them clearly what they can ask me and offered them time to read up ADA laws. I would've happily told them what she is trained to do. They just didn't care because they didn't want to let her in either way. She is very well trained and well behaved. She goes with me everywhere and staff regularly comment on how they forget that she is even there (which is the goal in public).",

            "selftext": "For several years I took 20 mg of Prozac for GAD and OCD. It helped wonderfully, but caused me to gain weight and virtually took away my ability to climax. In March of this year, I decided to stop. I was newly married and wanted neither of those side effects. Plus, if I wanted to have a baby in the future, I didn't want to be on the medication.\n\n\nBut Lord I didn't realize how much the Prozac helped me. Since stopping, my anxiety is in high gear once again. My periods are awful and come with significantly more depression than they did on Prozac. My IBS is once again terrorizing my stomach. I get dizzy, out of breath, nausea, sweaty palms, and racing thoughts. I took the absence of these things for granted for those years on Prozac. I forgot how bad it can be.\n\n\n\nSo I have an appointment set up for a new GP to go over this laundry list of concerns, and I think I'm going to ask about starting Prozac once again. The weight gain and sexual dysfunction is better than thinking I'm going to die everyday (hyperbole). I also am on a waiting list to start seeing a therapist who specializes in GAD/OCD with exposure therapy, since I've had CBT in the past and it didn't work much for me.\n\n\n\nI thought I could handle this on my own, but as more days go by I realize that I can't. While I feel pretty shitty right now, I at least feel good that I'm moving in the right direction.\n\n\n\nThanks for hearing me out &lt;3 ",

            "selftext": "I don\u2019t think anxiety ever goes away. At least, for me it doesn\u2019t. Maybe there are some #blessed people out there who have figured out a magical way to defeat their anxiety once and for all. But for most of us, there\u2019s no cure. There\u2019s no mountain you climb, or bridge you cross, so that you can get to the other side where you\u2019ll be free from worry and fear. It\u2019s more about learning to deal with anxiety when it comes, and learning to treasure those beautiful moments in time where it\u2019s temporarily absent.\n\nA life plagued by anxiety is one of racing heartbeats and fast breathing. Your shoulders often feel heavy and sometimes you\u2019re almost sure that you can see a dark cloud hanging over you. There\u2019s a strange fear that doesn\u2019t seem to stem from anything specific. It\u2019s just fear. It\u2019s just there. \n\nSometimes you can\u2019t enjoy a nice, peaceful train ride. Or a trip to the movies with your friends. Because the minute you sit down, you\u2019re forced to be with your own thoughts. They start running around in all different directions. You\u2019re thinking of possible dangerous scenarios, or things that have caused you anxiety in the past. Or you just feel scared for no reason at all. It just happens, and you wish it wouldn\u2019t.\n\nIt\u2019s worse in the winter. So much worse. The days are short and the weather is cold. It seems like it\u2019s always dark. The small amount of sunlight we experience during the day doesn\u2019t even feel like sunlight. It just feels like a strange and brief phase of the day that will be over quickly. Darkness will descend in no time.\n\nThis is when it\u2019s the hardest. When everyone feels cold and bitter and cranky and cooped up. We can\u2019t distract ourselves with light breezes and bright colors. We can\u2019t walk around outside for hours and free ourselves from our own heads. It\u2019s winter. Everything is dead and gray and muted and cold. This is when your state of mind and your way of thinking can either make you or break you.\n\nYou have to acknowledge that you probably will not defeat anxiety. You don\u2019t need to focus all of your energy on \u201cfixing yourself\u201d or finding a cure. Stop making yourself feel like there\u2019s something wrong with you. Stop making yourself feel ashamed of your anxiety. Stop being frustrated with yourself. Just because you can\u2019t beat anxiety doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re letting it win.\n\n\nYes, you\u2019re probably going to have to deal with it for the rest of your life. Not all the time, of course. Sometimes you will have incredibly wonderful periods of time where you don\u2019t have any anxiety. You can go days without it. You can go months without it. Sometimes you will go years before you have to deal with it again. But often, regardless of how long it\u2019s been, anxiety will find its way back to you. You do not have control over the cure, but the beautiful part is that you do have control over how you handle it.\n\nThe most important thing you have to work on is your state of mind. When anxiety starts to take over, it\u2019s tempting to give in to your thoughts. To let yourself crumble under the fear and the worry and the terror. What you have to remember is that you\u2019re not alone. You are not by yourself. You may feel like you are the only person in the world to ever feel like a prisoner inside their own mind, but you are not. There are so many others who have been where you\u2019ve been, but they eventually got free. Not free from anxiety, necessarily, but free from the dark way of thinking that anxiety can cause.\n\nA lot of people struggle from anxiety. Not everyone, but enough people to show you that there are others who have gotten through this, just like you will. You\u2019re struggling now. You\u2019re terrified now. You feel alone now. You\u2019re telling yourself it will be okay. You\u2019re telling yourself you will get through this. You\u2019re telling yourself you will be stronger when you come out on the other side. But you have a hard time believing it. That\u2019s okay. As long as you\u2019re trying to believe it, as long as you are wanting to believe it, those thoughts will carry you through the darker moments. And eventually, they will start to make sense. They will start to seem possibly true.\n\nA lot of people will give you a lot of different advice on how to deal with anxiety. Some of it will work for you, and some of it won\u2019t. Some of the things that do work for you will not work for your friend or your coworker. Everyone is different. Everyone\u2019s mind is different. So everyone will deal with anxiety a different way.\n\nHere\u2019s what you need to remember: there\u2019s a lot of advice floating out there about dealing with anxiety because so many people have had to deal with it. So when you\u2019re feeling ashamed or frustrated or exhausted or embarrassed about your anxiety, just remind yourself that you are normal. You are not a freak. You are not the only person in the world that has ever been this terrified. A lot of us are fighting it. A lot of us are scared. A lot of us have had bad nights that we didn\u2019t think were ever going to end, just like you have.\n\nYou are human. Which means you will get through it, just like so many other people have. You will not defeat it forever. But you will learn how to be okay \u2013 and more importantly, how to be happy \u2013 in spite of it. ",

Granted, I know my boss or coworkers wouldn't mind much, since I'm the first one in and last one out (managing a database for the state). But I can't help but feel like I'm letting them down just because I slept in an hour late for something I don't have much control over. I apologize for the wall of text, I don't know who else to talk to about this (I'm currently sitting in starbucks for the whole day so parents don't know). I also apologize for the rambling, it's so hard to stop thinking about it. Also, this is my first post on this sub, so I don't know if this is an acceptable post or not. Back to the point:\n\n**TL;DR:**\n\n**DAE** call out sick when they sleep in because of anxiety then end up having panic attacks for missing the work and lying to get out of it? All help is appreciated greatly.",

Not only is being disciplined more difficult for people with anxiety, but we have to do it more often because so many things seem scary.\n\nIt's like they don't understand what it's like to have to (metaphorically) crawl through barbed wire every single time you want to get something done. That's insanely difficult. \n\nSorry, I just needed to vent. I actually tried to push through the anxiety and get things done recently, and all that happened is that now I know exactly why I didn't want to do so in the first place. I recall the exact instance of when and how my anxiety started to get worse, and now all I want to do is avoid that situation even more.",
