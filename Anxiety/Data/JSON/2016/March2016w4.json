I've been taking photos for 10 years but finally got to take my first actual class, and I love Psych/hope to major in Psych and work in the field in the future.\n\nI haven't been in class since Winter quarter of 2013. My life was slowly falling apart and was officially in shambles by March of 2013. I didn't even withdraw, I just stopped going and failed, and was placed on academic dismissal. I won't get into everything that happened between March 2013 and March 2014, but it was pretty bad, and the culmination of many years of trauma and issues I had not dealt with, plus one big huge thing on top (I was sexually assaulted). I took 2014 &amp; 2015 to work hard on my health, my mental health, and myself. I got my own stable place for the first time in a long time, good jobs (as a nanny), fell in love (am still in love), and started living semi-normally... aside from severe anxiety. Which is something I've always had, but it has gotten more severe since 2014. Panic attacks regularly. Daily struggles to know what is something to worry about or something to ignore. Most of 2014 I was miserable. I didn't think I would ever live a normal life or be able to go back to school.\n\nWell I did. And I finished today with straight A's. And I haven't been having an easy time, even. I got sick three times, and when I get sick my anxiety flares up REALLY bad. I have an ovarian cyst, my sister was hospitalized, I went through some weird emotional stuff (I mean... who doesn't sometimes though)... yet somehow I fucking DID IT. I feel so proud. There were some days I wanted to give up and never go back. But I did it and I haven't felt so great in so long. I'm less than a year away from getting my AA finally and I'm so proud of myself.\n\nRanting here... but it is possible. My anxiety hasn't been debilitating as of late, or else I would not be able to attend school. But some days, it was. Some weeks, I had panic attacks between classes. But I did it. And I'm still in one piece. It IS possible.",

            "selftext": "A couple days ago I posted here explaining my constant 24/hr anxiety and panic episodes and how I was thinking about going to the doctors to get checked out. So here's the story,\nThis morning I woke up to my heart fluttering in my chest so I woke up my boyfriend and told him once again I think there's something wrong with my heart. He listens to my heart and says \"okay I can hear some irregularities let's go.\" Hearing those words you have no idea how scary and suureal It felt  to think I was going to find something life changing about my health. So When I get into the hospital I feel at the peak of my dizziness and luckily got a room right away. The doctor comes in and runs an ekg which I was mortified would come back with  bad news. It didn't and my heart was perfectly normal but to make sure he set me on a heart monitor to keep an eye on it in case I had more palpitations. But basically ruled me as having a severe panic attack.\nThroughout the rest of the morning I had a lot of counselors come and talk to me about how I felt, what was going on in my life currently and in the past that might have brought me to this point in my life now. Needless to say I broke down and let it all out. I spoke out about my constant obsessive thoughts about dying, my living situation, struggles with myself, self harm and all things that were deep inside that needed to come out that i haven't even thought about in years. It really made me feel good to have support for once that wasn't me reading shit online or asking  for support from people who dont understand how crippling anxiety and panic can be.\nAnyway, after talking to many counselors and after many tears they told me about an inpatient program that is from 9-3 everyday that focuses on group therapy,  emotional intervention and recieving intensive help from mental health professionals. So I am going to do it. And I am so excited to start the first step in receiving the treatment I need. Thank you for reading. I hope that anyone who is feeling scared or anxious knows that it's okay  to face your fears because after you know the truth all that's left is getting better.",

            "selftext": "For a lot of us with anxiety disorders, the morning is one of - if not THE - toughest parts of the day. Soon after waking up your mind is already jumping ahead to the day's tasks, and no matter how mundane these tasks may be, our anxious minds makes them all seem monumental: making food, showering, driving to work, working a full day, socializing, trying to act normal, etc. The idea of leaving the house and entering this big &amp; scary world becomes a daunting and nerve wrecking task in and of itself, and hiding in bed seems like the best option. Trust me, I know what this feels like.\n\nWell, there are a number of ways to deal with this morning anxiety, and some don't even require you to leave your bed. \n\n1) Exercise. I have found that the BEST way to kick morning anxiety is exercise: running, biking, or even going for a morning walk. It is an AWESOME way to start the day. However, I know it's not always possible due to lack of energy/motivation or other reason. \n\n2) Meditation. Breathing exercises and guided meditations are a great way to easily bring your mind back to the present instead of worrying about the day ahead. I've used the apps 'Breathe' and 'Calm', which are both great. Breathe has morning meditations which allow you to destress without even leaving the comfort of your bed. \n\n3) Yoga. I don't mean going to a yoga class or doing some extravagant hour-long yoga session. A nice 8-10 minute morning yoga session works well with meditation to help bring your focus to your breath and focus on the present. I use the app 'Daily Yoga' which has a great morning yoga routine.\n\nHope this helps somebody. Take care all.",

            "selftext": "I felt I needed to share this nightmare week with Japan Airlines.\n\nI have anxiety and depression, and along with medication and lifestyle adjustments, I also have an emotional support animal. I know that a lot of people do not agree with or understand having an emotional support animal, but that point is moot - she is licensed, I have the documentation and i am protected by the Air Carrier Access Act if I want to bring her with me on my flight. She is registered with the city government, so I have an assistance dog tag issued by the city. Even though I have the right to put her on my lap, I choose not to because I don't want to inconvenience any staff or passengers with her presence, so I choose to keep her in her carrier under the seat in front of me. She is well trained, does not go to the bathroom at all (during the whole 9-10 hours) and does not bark. Most people don't know she is there and there has never been a complaint.\n\nI have flown with her every year for the past 5-6 years, sometimes twice, when I return to Japan. The people at the airport, the USDA, and the ministry of agriculture staffing Haneda International Airport know me - I always have all my documentation in order and keep on top of everything. I have always notified the airline within 48 hours of BOOKING the flight, even though their website requests 48 hour before BOARDING.\n\nThis time was no different. I had all the relevant paperwork, I had my medical notes within one year, I had notified them and they called me a few weeks later to confirm my seat and that everything had been cleared with Haneda. Last week, we got a call from the JAL office in Southern California telling me my documentation was insufficient. They demanded I send my medical paperwork to their generic \"help desk\" email.  I told them I felt uncomfortable and would prefer sending it to a representative that could handle my case, rather than to their \"contact us\" email address. They refused, so I relented sending the note and a photo of the front and back of my city issued assistance dog tag. I asked her why there was suddenly a problem with my flight this time and she claimed I had never flown with them. She made me look up my own previous flight records and give her the dates - all of which are on their website using their mileage bank account. She then said I must have snuck my dog onto the plane or just shown up at the airport with my dog and pushed my way through. I told her that I always gave notice within 48 hours of buying my tickets and she scoffed at me.\n\nThe next day they called demanding a \"certificate\" from the US government that another passenger had sent them. After some prying, it turns out someone had recently sent them a certificate from one of those pay websites that make you a fake service dog certificate. (https://www.usservicedogregistry.org/) I informed them that my tag was city government issued and the certificate was a scam. The woman on the phone yelled at me and threatened to \"call the number on the tag\" and that she was going to find out that it was fake. I told her she was more than welcome to call. She wanted to prove to me the certificate was real and my tag was not.\n\n10 minutes later I got a much more subdued phone call from her saying she had called and it did indeed turn out to be the city office and that they assured her the tag was authentic and that my dog was definitely a recognized assistance animal. She said she would get back to me later.\n\nThis past Friday, she called saying my doctors note was missing a medical license number so i would need to get a new note. Inconvenient since I fly on Tuesday evening, but I made an appointment with my doctor for Monday (the soonest available) and got a new note with all the relevant information that they requested. I emailed that to them and they said they would get back to me later.\n\nAt 8 pm tonight, I received a phone call from a very rude and angry woman at the southern California office saying she wasn't allowing me to board my flight because the medical license number was written as CA LIC # _________ instead of as a sentence stating \"I am licensed in the state of California.\" She accused me of faking the license number and said there was no way to recognize the letters CA as California, despite the address of the doctor's letterhead also using CA instead of writing out the word California. We told her she could easily look this up on the medical board website (www.mbc.ca.gov) and verify the doctors name, the license number, the state in which she is licensed to practice, and the year she began practicing medicine. She said we were lying. She then laughed at me having a disability and laughed that I have anxiety and she said she didn't care that it wasn't acceptable for her to deny me access to the flight. She said there is no law or any legal right for me to board the plane even with all the documentation and laughed loudly at both me and my husband while I was in near tears. We tried to tell her how to look up the number and all she did was constantly scream and talk over us and told us to be quiet while laughing at me being disabled.\n\nIn tears, my husband and I packed up all our documentation, rented a car, and drove to the airport immediately after. We called someone from JAL at the white courtesy telephone to ask them what we should do because I am supposed to fly tomorrow. The staff that came down knew my name and recognized me as the girl who does this regularly and always has all the proper documentation and that there will be NO problem tomorrow. She checked my documents and assured me that if they call again, to ask they call SFO and check with the staff at the airport because I am cleared to go tomorrow. I felt so much better. The staff at SFO were amazing and very comforting and even though it was a hassle to rent a car late at night to drive out there, it was worth it to know that we were safe.\n\nNone of this excuses the behavior of the staff in Southern California. No one should be persecuted and mocked for having anxiety or a disability. I have never had this kind of treatment with an airline. My husband and I both felt attacked particularly after pointing out that they had been given a false document by a previous passenger. Also, those fake websites and fake registries for service animals need to be shut down. It makes things difficult for people who have a medical necessity and have the proper documentation.\n\nAll of this was ridiculous. I have not been offered an apology nor any compensation. I just needed to get this out there, it has been a very long week. :(\n\n-------\nedit: As of 10:30am, JAL corporate in Tokyo has been in contact with the JAL SFO staff who told them what is what and that I am getting on that plane. The woman who yelled at us last night from their american customer service office called us - and my husband is making a complaint as I type. We are going to do what we can and will discuss with the staff at SFO when I go back for my flight tonight. I cannot stress this enough, the staff that we spoke to in San Francisco at the airport were amazing and are still working on my behalf. I cannot thank them enough for everything. I am sad to think that if I had been a new passenger and the staff not recognized me, that I would be alone with no one in my corner, but hopefully through this nightmare they will overhaul their process in dealing with ESA in the future. If JAL wants to continue service into the US, they will need to comply with our regulations, so something needs to change!\n\nIf anyone has any questions about flying with an ESA or what information you need to discuss with your medical provider, feel free to message me. :)\n\n----\nWe have slowly worked our way up through their staff in their southern california office and are filing the appropriate complaints. They have been pretty smug saying they are \"allowing me\" by way of their very generous nature to board the plane despite all of our incomplete paperwork. By incomplete they are citing the fact that our doctor wrote CA instead of California. They never sent us any guidelines as to what should be in the letter, we had to research this ourselves and added everything every other airline has listed as necessary and even more detail into my condition than is required. We also redirected them (again) to the specific section of the Air Carrier Access Act on the Department of Transportation website that protect the rights of disabled persons, and we are filing a complaint with the DoT directly.",

Hearing people have panic attacks and feeling helpless makes me panic, so I was also panicking, doesn't justify it but yeah she said I've been cold for the past while, she said it with lots of bitterness and resentment in her voice, like she was just sick of me. I don't blame her, and I actually feel the same way, that I have become less understanding, more isolated, cold, bitter, removed, numb, etc. But it hurts so so badly hearing someone you just love with all your heart say that. I wanna kill myself again, and might go through with it. She is right, this thing has taken away completely who I am. I am usually empathetic, compassionate, understanding, loving, pessimistic yet optimistic and just kind of humourous about it all, etc. But lately I've been cold, removed, dark, rude, crass, numb, end just wicked and I guess she feels it the most. I don't know what I hope to accomplish by posting this, just that this illness has ruined my life, my personality, my friendships, and now the thing that is literally one of the two things I love for: My relationship with my girlfriend. Wish me luck making it to the end of the fucking year.\n\nPS if anyone at Okanagan College wants to take my place for a journalism course when I kill myself, PM me \n\nEDIT: This is probably the most upvotes I've ever gotten on a post...Im actually very touched you guys all care.

Sorry that this is so poorly written, I'm just so shaken.\n\nI just need to get this off my chest to someone or something. I've been best friends with this girl for the past year and I've known for quite some time that she has anxiety, before she did even. I talk to her every day, some days it's talking her through panic attacks and some days it's just talking to the person I love. We started dating recently and it's been so wonderful, but her anxiety has gotten so severe. The past two nights have been so incredibly rough. She's been on Zoloft for about a month now with a day or two where she has actually felt no anxiety whatsoever. She was prescribed this after having daily panic attacks and it hasn't really done anything in the bigger picture. Two days ago, she was prescribed the generic Diazepam for her panic attacks and anxiety. She's supposed to take one at night, and so that night she took one. The very next day (yesterday) I saw her at 4:30, and at 4:55 she started having a panic attack. This panic attack wasn't like any of the others one I've seen. It was the worse one she's ever had. This attack shook her violently and had her in absolute terror, lasting for six whole hours with a maximum of 5-10 minutes of relief in between every so often. We took her to the ER and arrived at 6:20. She wasn't admitted to a room for another hour and half and once we got in, the nurse essentially said all they could give her was a sister drug of Benadryl. She took as many as 4 different types of drugs last night and not a single one helped. Today was even worse; her panic attacks shook her so bad it was like she was having a seizure. My heart just hurts so bad. I can't do anything but watch her in absolute agony and I just need a place to express all this. I wish I could help and she says I am the one thing that helps, but god it hurts so bad that I can't tell her if things are going to get better. I guess I post this here for advice from those who have been in similar situations on either side. I just needed to get this off my chest.",

I used to be a fairly heavy coffee drinker, 2-3 large cups per day (though I know many people have way more). Even though I felt anxious during my coffee drinking stint, I blamed myself for feeling that way and never considered giving up coffee; to me, everyone drank it and it seemed to be a necessity it to be productive at work. I'd experience mood swings, anxiety, and overall discomfort but attributed a lot of this to work stress/other factors. \n\nRecently went on vacation (drinking more coffee than usual) and noticed that even in the absence of work and it's related stress, I was still experiencing mood swings / depression. I decided to try cutting back on caffeine by switching from coffee to tea, and noticed a nearly instant difference. Mood swings significantly diminished, anxiety lowered, mental clarity increased, sleep improved, and overall state of mind was much better. Caffeine detox wasn't easy, but man it's worth it.\n\nI'm not saying coffee/caffeine is inherently bad, but it is addictive and for some people - especially us with anxiety - we should be watching how much we intake. It's not for everyone. \n\nJust a thought. Hope somebody finds this helpful.",

            "selftext": "I'm pretty sure nostalgia is generally supposed to bring warm feelings. Even though the definition implies a longing for the past, it still generally seems to be a happy longing like \"yah, that was awesome\". But for me, it just fills me with regret and negativity. I just think about how much better things were, or how I could've done things differently to not be where I am now. This happens with lots of things in my past that I'm nostalgic for.\n\nTo be more specific about what made me think to post this, I have always loved Japan. I studied abroad there and loved it. My whole college period was based on getting myself to Japan. However, I'm extremely indecisive, so I changed majors a few times, and even entered grad school without thinking and am now gonna drop out after a semester because it's not what I want. It seems the only way left for me to get back is to either become an English teacher and be poor forever and have student loans over my head forever, hardly get to experience much while I'm there, and never get to travel. Or I can hope that I'll get there in another career in 10, 15, 20 years, if I'm lucky.\n\nThinking about that just kills me. I had accepted for the past month or so that I will be ok living here, cause I still can live in awesome places like Chicago, Seattle, New York, Miami, or some big city. But I saw something (a Wikipedia article about a small train station I frequented in Japan), and it just crushed me. It brought back all those memories and the regret I feel for screwing up my dreams.\n\nI wish I could just be happy where I am. I mean, everyone has grand dreams that go unfulfilled or they know are unlikely, and they seem fine where they are. Why can't I just live in the present and be happy with my life? And why don't I have confidence in myself at all? Cause maybe it is possible. Maybe I could be an entrepreneur or something. But I'm so negative about my future and have no self-confidence, that I wouldn't even take the steps to accomplish that. Nostalgia sucks. Sometimes I wish I could erase some of my memories or forget some of my dreams entirely.",

            "selftext": "Hello!\n\nSo, I've gone from having an average of 10-30 panic attacks a day while waking to having up to 50 in a 24 hour period...  This is because, within the last week, I've started having panic attacks in my sleep.  I am usually (80-90% of the time) NOT dreaming when these happen.  They wake me from my sleep, cause me to run around frantically, beat my fiance awake, and then vomit.\n\nI already have terrible insomnia, and this just makes things worse.  I feel like I'm slowly losing my grip with reality.  It's so disorienting waking up in full panic mode, in the dark, and desperately sick to my stomach...  and it's only been a week, and it's wearing me down already.  I can't even find peace when I try to nap during the day if I have the time.  And it's having a kindling effect--I feel like the more I have, especially while asleep, the more severe, prolonged, and frequent they become.\n\nHave any of you experienced this?  Has anything helped?  I'll even consider additional meds...  This is unbearable.  I took 10 mg Ambien last night to help me calm down, but in the wee hours in the morning after it wore off, the panic jolted me awake again for several hours.  Self-harm is the only way I can snap myself out of panic attacks, especially if I'm alone.  I look terribly gnarly right now.\n\nI'm beyond frustrated already...  I'm having up to freaking FIFTY panic attacks in 24 hours.  This is ridiculous.  I'm still going about my daily life fairly normally, but this is really putting a strain on my life in every aspect.  \"Distressed\" is the only word I can think of to describe how I feel.\n\nWhat do I do?\n\nEdit:\n\nTo those of you who have PMed me rudely and downvoted me for any reason...  I have to ask WHY?  I came here for help, and I'm just being met with skepticism and some cruel remarks.  NOT HELPFUL!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",
