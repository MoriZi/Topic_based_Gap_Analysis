I refused but the pressure was unceasing and I started crying. \"Just play the piano and it'll be over!\" I ran and hid under a table in my friend's gazebo. Everybody ran and followed, then started pressuring me to come out. \n\nMy mom threatened to take my books away if I didn't play the piano. When we got home she yelled, \"YOU'RE SO ANTISOCIAL IT'S SCARY! YOU'RE NEVER USING YOUR COMPUTER AGAIN!\" I got fucking grounded and had my computer taken away, like everything was 100% my fault. \n\nThat is absolute hell, being surrounded by people pressuring you to do something that you have a phobia of doing. It would be so easy if a firm \"no\" would stop the pressure, but it only seems to bring more attention and pressure to yourself. If/when the pressure stops, you are seen as rude, unfun, and scared of \"nothing\".",

Just like how I used to be when I was younger. Well not quite, I've come to realize I've always been somewhat anxious, but nowhere near my current state. Last weekend I felt so unhindered. Taking my due slice of the social cake, and joking with everything and everyone. After a flurry of successful jokes and context related friendly disses, a friend of mine who knows a tiiiny bit about my issues, said \"you become more like your younger self when you're drunk\", referring to me 3-5 years ago when I was like this pretty much all the time. I've always had moments of what I think I could describe as anxiety, in specific scenarios like talking to someone I don't know and with no one else that I know with me.\n\nI hadn't considered it all that much until he said it, but since then I've thought alot about it and I truly feel the same.\n\nNow, I don't drink very often; once a month or so, and I don't mean to sound like \"I want to be drunk all the time\", far from it. But I wanted to mention this and hear from you guys if any of you have felt the same thing, and your eventual thoughts on it. Do you feel your anxiety is lessened when drunk?",

I thought about my most scary thoughts and they did nothing for me. I thought about failing life, school and friends and I still felt safe and happy. \n\nWhat the hell is this state? It only lasted for 10 minutes and it gradually went away to the 'normal me'. Is this really how normal people live life? Are we missing out on this feeling all the time? Fuck man.. that would be so sad :(.\n\n\n**edit**: I have drastically changed my lifestyle although it's been only 2 weeks. Although I don't feel very different from how I normally feel (GAD), I do feel like i'm heading upwards. I want to thank everybody for the positive words. I will stick to it and hope i'll feel better, not only for me but for all of us. I know I sound ridicilous right now like I am at the oscars, but hey, just needed to vent this haha.",

I know -- stupid. Then afterwards did research and found out they are a cult. Although I have not heard reports of violence, I have heard reports of stalking. I am now up late at night and my anxiety is through the roof. I don't think I'll be able to sleep tonight.

            "selftext": "Hi all!  I have been feeling great as of late, better than I've ever felt in the past.  I'm finally feeling a healing feeling, rather than a coping feeling.  It's been weeks since I've had a panic attack. Although I have anxious moments, I'm able to recognize them and let them pass better than ever before.\n\nI'd thought I'd share some tips.  I've tried to list them from most general to most specific.  Don't worry about cost - all of these tips include free resources.  Don't worry about your interest level - if any of these tips help you, that is great, and if not, it is ok, just leave them be :) \n\n*  Develop a diet plan.  Although it's easy to stress eat/drink when you feel anxious, you know that you'll always feel worse afterwards.  Once you start eating better, you'll recondition your mind and body - it will feel better, you will feel better, you will associate that positive feeling with this better food, and a negative feeling with bad food.  Eat a diet that is conducive to feeling calm and peaceful.  For me, that means avoiding high salt/sugar foods, fried foods, milk, coffee, and alcohol.  \n* Develop an exercise plan.  Exercise is a huge release of endorphin, as well as an improvement of body image.  If you don't feel comfortable in a big gym, just try to get moving - walk outside down the street, in a park, or walk your dog.  Exercise at least 3 days a week, 30-60 minutes each day.\n* See a therapist.  If your anxiety feels severe, see someone at least once a week.  If it's not so severe, see them at least every other week.  I recommend therapists over psychiatrists because therapists are there to focus on you and your cognitive therapy, while psychiatrists are there your medication and drug therapy.  (Please see a psychiatrist if you feel it is necessary though!)\n* Remove yourself from the most stressful situation in your life.  For me, that meant quitting my job.  I've been working part time, and that's helped me float along while finding another job.  However, while I've been unemployed, I've been working on the following tips.\n*  Work on building up your self-image.  It will re-program your inner thoughts from negative to positive, from fear and scarcity to love and abundance.  Listen to motivational tapes every day, while in the shower in the morning, while working, while exercising, or while driving.  It takes a few months and a few listens - repetition is key.  If you don't like a particular speaker or a particular message, it's ok to search for another one.  There's a lot of positive and motivational content out there.  [Les Brown](https://soundcloud.com/larry-amos-jr/day-8-les-brown-self-approval) is my favorite speaker.  [Joseph Clough](https://soundcloud.com/larry-amos-jr/sets/joseph-clough-nlp-coaching) is another good one.  This has been the LARGEST change for me.\n*  Work on meditation.  This is difficult for people with anxiety, because our minds are always racing.  Meditation is a dedicated time to focus on thinking positively and introspectively.  Let your mind wander, and then focus on positive mantras as they come to you.  There is a lot of [meditation music](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nb3okem4OCk), as well as [guided meditation videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vx8iUvfyCY) - I find these help a lot.  While I've been unemployed, my mantras have been, \"You are a good person that will find the right job.\" \"You will be successful at creating your own career.\" \"Your credit score is irrelevant - you have everything you need credit for anyways.\"\n* Work on shaping your thoughts while interacting with others.  Those of us with anxiety, especially extreme social anxiety, are very very uncomfortable when speaking with others.  We might be thinking people are constantly judging us, or we might constantly judge others.  We might be thinking of what we will say next, to appease the other person, rather than really listening.  We might not really be listening at all, because we are so nervous while interacting with others.  Instead, I have been focusing on re-programming my thoughts about interacting with others.  The two biggest influences here have been [How to Win Friends and Influence People by Dale Carnegie](https://soundcloud.com/larry-amos-jr/sets/dale-carnegie-how-to-win), and [177 Mental Toughness Secrets of the World Class by Steve Siebold](https://soundcloud.com/larry-amos-jr/sets/177-mental-toughness-secrets).  It has helped me to make others feel important, avoid criticism in my speech, avoid ego-based thoughts, and connect much more genuinely with people.  I practice these tips every day, and get a little better each time.\n* Create your own opportunities for your life, through your job, and your thinking.  Build your dream, and make it a reality.  Name the thing that you've always wanted to do, and do just a little bit of it.  Then build it, grow it, nurture it, and go after it.  It is your dream, you deserve it!  [Les Brown](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlUMrzwmbyo) is a great resource for motivation, and [Jim Rohn](https://soundcloud.com/larry-amos-jr/sets/jim-rohn-how-to-build-a) and [Tim Ferriss Four Hour Workweek](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hiNWwPAfV4) are great resources for business thinking.  You don't have to start a business, but there is likely an idea that you've had that you haven't done yet because you didn't believe you could, so you've been holding yourself back.  It is really powerful once you face your fears and do it anyways.  For me, that meant starting my business, and leaving my full-time job.  Since then, I've been able to work 10 hours a week, do home improvement projects, volunteer for a political campaign, and work on an app start-up.  I'm able to spend my time the way I want to.

            "selftext": "I have lived thousands of miles and several timezones away from friends and family, in a totally different culture, where to understand the local language you need to learn three new alphabets, but now that I am back in my home country and considering moving away from the big city and my hometown (to somewhere quieter, to do something less stressful), I am finding it hard to overcome anxiety and actually make the move.\n\nI have travelled alone for several months in far away places, taken risks like leaving a stable job to work as a tour guide, but since a traumatic experience at the end of my time overseas, I have been experiencing anxiety.\n\nI have never experienced this kind of generalised anxiety before. Previously I would have embarked on this kind of move knowing that there were risks but also that it was worth the effort.\n\nI came back with some savings and wanted to give myself a break since my time abroad was a bit intense and my job when I came back was not at all interesting. I have already left the job but now each day that I don't do anything it's very frustrating and hard not to become negative and feel stuck (trapped).\n\nI'm sure I'm not the only one who has experienced this and I am sure there is a different way of looking at it. I am looking for examples of how you may have overcome this kind of situation.\n\nThanks for reading and I value your comments, thoughts or advice.\n\nTL/DR: Moved back home after three years living abroad, want to move away to a quieter, more relaxing place and do a less stressful job but finding it hard to overcome anxiety.",

In my province there are 3 levels of license (G1, G2, G), the last two of which require a driving test. I only really started driving when I was 24, and have had A LOT of anxiety about driving. Fear of not being good enough, getting distracted, ruining someone's car, etc. I failed my G2 test twice in large part because of my anxiety (of both driving AND being tested/observed). So when I realized my G2 license was going to expire in March I started panicking...Despite having driven halfway across Canada with a friend, driving on the big highways regularly alone, etc. I was so nervous that I would fuck up something basic and fail the test. \n\nBut I passed! On the first attempt! I practiced with a few people in the weeks coming up to the test, really focused on my weakest driving areas (parking, ugh) and only told 3 people I was even taking the test. That was huge in reducing the anxiety I felt when thinking about having to tell everyone if I failed. In the hours before the test I kept reminding myself \"either way you'll be done in X number of hours\" and that lots of people fail their first try. Add in a beta blocker and I passed. \n\nHope this helps some of you :) \n\n",
