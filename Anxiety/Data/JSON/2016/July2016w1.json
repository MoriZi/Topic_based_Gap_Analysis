Sorry, I just wanted to share with someone who would understand what a big deal this is. I can't believe I did it!\n\nEdit: Thanks so much for all the support, I didn't realize how many people have anxiety about driving. A lot of people have asked questions about how I got over the anxiety, how I made myself take the test, etc. My biggest fear about driving was that I would confuse the gas and the brake. That did happen once, but I was able to correct it, and hasn't happened since. It very quickly becomes second nature.\n\nSecond, driving really isn't as scary as you think. Everyone on the road is a person, everyone makes mistakes driving, but you can quickly correct the mistakes. Its okay to make mistakes sometimes, just stay alert enough to notice and fix the mistake.\n\nThird, you just have to do it. I swear, your fear is worse than driving. I was absolutely terrified of driving, I just got home from my first time in the car by myself. It really is okay.  And driving is so freeing, I had no idea what I was missing out on.

I got a call from a gas station saying they'll give me a shot. I've been out of work because of my anxiety for four years and today I feel like I can do anything. I have climbed a mountain and my head feels clear. I know its not a big deal working at a gas station but I will be able to get out of the house everyday. Anyway Im sorry if this is the wrong place for this. I just wanted to say thank you and to everyone who is also struggling like I am to not give up. One small step at a time has given me so much right now.\n\nEDIT: I'll never understand how many beautiful people are out there.. You all made me cry a bit. I was thinking this would just go unnoticed but to see so many people happy for me and working through things like me makes me feel a lot better about overcoming this. I leave in an hour and I am really terrified. The hardest part now is going and starting. Learning everything, meeting people and I admit, I'm afraid I'm too out of shape and will not do my best. Four years is a long time to stay in my home worrying about the outside world. I gained weight and didn't take care of myself. But if you all can promise to try to do your best then I can promise I'll try my best today as well. When I have to overcome something that my anxiety is telling me I can't or it'd be easier to not, I tell myself \"One step at a time.\" Before you know it, you're out the door and making a life for yourself and your loved ones. Don't let that evil monster ruin who you are and who I know you can be. I wish you all the best.",

I started reading The Anxiety and Phobia workbook which helped me out so much. I changed my attitude and outlook on everything. Changed my diet and started walking/running. I still have moments of anxiety and depression which I am hoping therapy and possible medication will help but if you truly want a change you have to make it happen.",

My boyfriend of three years snaps at me and says 'why can't you just behave like a normal person. I hate the way you drive. I don't have anxiety so why should I have to deal with it.' I broke down crying right before my appointment, and he apologised straight away, but I can't shake it. I already feel like such a nuisance. I already know the way I act isn't normal.

            "selftext": "Hello guys, my name is Paulo, I'm from Brazil and new here. And before everything, I used to be a productive guy that studied a lot about everything in my course(comp. Science).\n\nBut then I have this problem since I left my first internship in a startup company, which I worked with games. There I used to work 7-9 hours a day, and sometimes 11 hours. After I started to maintain three different games, came the huge responsability and pressure from my bosses to make everything faster. So I started to feel bad and have fear to fail in my tasks.\n\n\nSince then, I can't hold a job for more than a day, I started a job in a Bank and left in the same day, I felt disgusted there, the ambient, the lack of emotions in the employees, the feeling of working only for money and nothing else... All this together drove me to leave in the first day of job. I felt bad and mediocre, my family and bf judged me because I left a good job. Actually the interview process lasted for 2 weeks and I did not even worked there for more than a day, it was hard for me too....\n\n\nAfter that, I tried another internship in a small startup, passed in the interview process and left before the first day, I could not stop thinking about going there and failing on all tasks they would ask me to do. \n\nSo, lately I applied for internships and always give excuses to not go to the presencial interview. It seems that I already gave up the entire job market, it just seems corrupted.\n\nNowdays, I have only 2 semesters left in university and I can't study anything, having the feeling of wasting time... Maybe I don't like my field of study anymore.... Now I'am very interested in languages... I am learning french and japonese now, and this is the only thing I can keep going with excitement. \n\nI hope you guys can understand what I mean, maybe I did not explained very well because english is not my native language. Therefore, my situation is a mess, I hate the job market for now, they make us slaves, yell at us and treat our emotions like shit(because you must be a robot, right?). Probably I'm going to be a teacher and help others grow intellectually and personally.\n\nThat's all, thanks! =)",

            "selftext": "Wall of text incoming(?)\n\n\nI just don't understand it.\n\n\nI've always been a good student. Straight A's all throughout elementary and middle school for as long as I can remember, other than the 7th grade. Got A's in all of my 9th grade first semester finals, finished first semester with 1 B, 3 A's, and got 2 A's and 2 B's for second semester finals. Finished second semester with all A's. I plan to always take honors, which is something I've been doing, or possibly go into AP courses.\n\n\nI'm moving into 10th grade now, but it was around when I had second semester finals that things just felt... different. \n\n\nAt the time, Spanish II was one of my courses. It was easily the most stressful out of all, English is my native language, and there is just something about learning a new language that is difficult for me. \n\n\nIt was a few weeks before finals when things began to be noticeable. I would walk into my classes, mainly Spanish, and I just forgot. I didn't know what some words meant, even some obvious words, it felt as if half my vocabulary had vanished out of thin air. Not to mention that paying attention in class was difficult as well. I tried my hardest, but it all felt as if I was in a dream. Words that I should obviously know, I didn't. \n\n\nNow, it also feels like I don't know as much of my native language, English. I used to be an avid speller. I would enter spelling bees all the time throughout elementary/middle, all the way up to 8th grade, and I'd always place. Now, it seems much more difficult to form words and sentences. Words that I should definitely know how to spell, I don't. Sometimes, when I read, I just completely don't understand what the passage is saying. Sometimes, I'll have to read over something several times in order to fully comprehend it, which is something I never used to have to do.\n\n\nNow, it also feels like I'm losing grasp of basic concepts. Just a few moments ago, I was looking at 3 handed clock, and I just completely forgot how you're supposed to tell time like that. I didn't know what the numbers represented, what the hands represented, or anything. I was able to recall the memory after a few moments, but I've never had that much trouble trying to recall such a simple concept that I've known basically throughout my entire life, and what should be known as common sense.\n\n\nI'm afraid of the 10th grade now. I'm afraid that things won't click, that I won't be able to understand and comprehend, or even remember concepts that were taught.\n\n\nNow that it's the Summer time, I thought that I could just relax and not notice a change, but as time goes by, it just feels more and more prominent. \n\n\nIf anybody has any insight, or any words/opinions, they are all welcome. I can use any thoughts that anybody has.\n\n\nThanks for reading.",

Lately my memory and concentration are just shit. I have like 45 open excel documents right now with partially done things and my boss came over here and I told me to do a really simple small task and I wrote it down word for word on my hand to keep from forgetting after asking her to repeat it twice- I'm sure she thinks I'm an idiot. I work 8 hours a day and I have no idea how I spend so much time getting nothing done. \n\n\nI've noticed this memory/concentration problem occurring as my anxiety seems to be on the upswing again. The last time I was on Paxil I felt like my memory and concentration were great so I was thinking about going back on it. I did a google search for Paxil and memory and apparently memory loss is a side effect? Now I'm afraid to get back on it because if anything makes me lose any more memory I will be drooling into a cup asking everyone to repeat themselves because I can't remember 5 seconds ago. \n\n\nDoes anyone have any experience with this? Does anxiety cause memory issues? I feel like I'm going nuts. \n\n\nThanks! Also sorry if this post is rambly and inconsistent-- that's kind of the problem haha.",

I'm new to this sub, I have anxiety myself, and I completely understand why some of you are calling out for help. \n\nBut I'm also noticing that so few of your are receiving responses, which is very frustrating and probably doesn't feel too good. I have my theory as to why this is happening. Many of us need help and are in no position to offer any. I read some of your posts and say, \"Oh, I know what I would do in this situation,\" but I don't want to say anything. This is not out of selfishness\u2014it is out out caution. I know that I'm not okay. If I'm not okay, how could I have the audacity to offer any of you advice? I'm no counsellor or therapist or psychologist. What if my advice makes somebody worse off? \n\nI would like to know if any of you acknowledge this or feel the same. The reason I bring this up is because there has to be a better way to make this sub more productive for more people. I would like to help make this happen. It is human nature to be concerned primarily with yourself and your own experience, but what if we could make this our experience? What if we could collectively channel our energies into something that benefits the majority? \n\nWe all have such different experiences, it becomes exhausting for a single person to read everyone's stories and respond, no matter how much some of us might like to. Hopefully I'm not alone in this. I'm open to hear what you have to say.\n\ntl;dr: There are too many people here asking for advice and too few offering any. How can we make this community more beneficial for everyone? ",

I love animals to death, but I've been having suicidal thoughts and severe, severe anxiety - I don't think it's worth it at this point. \n\nANYWAY, \n\nI put up an ad online to try to find him a loving home, because I don't want him to end up in a shelter. I mentioned the reason for getting rid of him was because of his behaviour towards my new dog (I didn't really want to get into my mental health issues on a public forum!) and some lady sent me this long, aggressive e-mail ranting at me because I am so \"cruel\" to re-home my cat. \n\nThis person doesn't know me or my situation and chose to judge off an ad - and even took the time to send me a lengthy, rude e-mail on top of that!\n\nI don't usually care what people think but this incited SO MUCH rage and anxiety, I've been stressing about it for hours :(",
