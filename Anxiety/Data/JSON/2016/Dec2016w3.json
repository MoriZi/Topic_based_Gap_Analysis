This itself is interesting to me because it shows how each person is effected differently.  \n\nIt's also kind of alarming how people talk to each other here, like there's no way these people actually speak to people face to face like they do on here.  You can have a really negative interaction with someone, and see in their post history that they're intensely unhappy people, because they spend most of their time fighting with strangers on the internet.  \n\nAnd then there's smaller subreddits like this one, where people are struggling to get through the day, but we're here to help each other.  These smaller subs are the bees knees, though!  Everyone is so supportive and helpful.  \n\nTL;DR  Reddit is an interesting slice of life.",

Some may consume the flesh during an episode.\n\nI recently found out there's a name for a bad habit I have, which is due to my anxiety.

Ive probably dedicated over 30 hours this week to studying. I've gotten 3 hours of sleep everyday since Monday, and at around 3am today and my 4th cup of coffee I realized how much I still did not know. I waited until last minute to study Calculus because I wanted to focus on Biology, and as I looked at the lists and lists of information I didn't know I felt like I was drowning and the walls were closing in on me. I couldn't breath, and I felt so alone and isolated. I rarely cry, but I instantly broke down in panicked sobs and called my mom. I feel delirious from lack of sleep and everything I read makes no sense, even if it did before. I'm lying in bed now, but I know I will not sleep. I feel so incredibly stupid and gross.  I know it's only my first semester of college, but I am just so disappointed and embarrassed. I used adderall for the first time this week for studying, and that makes me feel so disgusting. I didn't even want to mention that but I feel like it's important. I used it three days in a row, and now I feel like the shell of myself. I know the side effects can be periods of feeling \"low\", which was a really stupid fucking decision on my part considering my default setting is already low. \nI just felt like I needed to say this, for myself and for anyone else who is feeling the same way about finals. Test taking is not a testament to your self worth. Take care of yourself and your body above all, don't try to take shortcuts, perform to the best of your abilities and be proud that you gave it your all. Exams are so stressful, especially to those with anxiety, so just by taking them you accomplished so much. Congrats to everyone who had finals this week, you made it. ",

            "selftext": "I've been nervous and easily stressed all my life. I feel afraid most of the time, even about things that seem silly, like making a phone call. I haven't been diagnosed with anxiety, but I've always assumed this is because my nervousness about doctors has kept me from actually going to the doctor and asking about it. I've had some recent changes in my life that have been motivating me to take positive steps in my life. To that end, I made my first appointment with a therapist, but they had no open dates until February, so it'll be a while before I can go. I've also been considering just putting on my big girl panties and dragging my frightened ass to the doctor to see if they can help me. That said, I have several concerns about going, so I thought I'd post here and see if you all have any thoughts for me. \n\n1) I'm very functional. My anxiety makes me unhappy often, but I've been dealing with it my whole life and I'm good at handling it. Maybe I'm afraid all the time, but that hasn't stopped me from forming solid relationships, earning my degree, or getting and keeping a job. Is a doctor likely to diagnose me with anxiety if I'm anxious all the time but it doesn't really interfere with my life? I'm terrified that I'll go and they'll tell me there's nothing wrong with me. \n\n2) I've read up on medication for anxiety and it seems that a lot of it can really decrease your sex drive and that taking most medications for anxiety means you're not allowed to drink. My sexuality is a big part of who I am and I really don't want to lose that. Additionally, I'm really interested in craft beers and ciders, and while I don't drink to excess often, I love having a beer or two while playing board games with my friends. Tasting and trying new beers is a big part of my social life and I don't want to lose that either. Is it worth asking my doctor for medication if there isn't anything that won't interfere with my sex life or my love trying of craft beer? \n\nOverall, I'm finally willing to go to the doctor about my anxiety if it has the possibility of being a positive step for me. However, I'm terrified of the doctor and it doesn't seem worth putting myself through the stress of going if they're pretty sure not to diagnose me or if there's no medication that won't take away parts of my life that I love. Is it better to just continue dealing with my anxiety until I can get in to see a therapist or should I struggle through the visit to the doctor?",

            "selftext": "[This is the post I wrote today to inform people about our condition (I suffer from GAD). I translated it just for you from Italian, my mother tongue]:\n\nI just wanted to remind you that, even though many of us smile in their daily lives, pretending nothing has happened, many people out there suffer from a lot of mental illnesses. You shouldn't tell us that it will go away, that it's just a phase, that we're inventing what we're going through, that everyone of us suffers. An analogy I am fond of is the wine one: drinking a glass of wine per meal is healthy, drinking a bottle per day is not. The same goes for anxiety, and the other negative feelings. We're all anxious in our daily lives, but try waking up feeling like crying, the body so stiff that it hurts and having trouble breathing only because our body feels scared.\n\nI can understand, but not justify, the reason why many people go away from who has these problems, for the fear that they themselves will be infected. Someone among us is so reluctant to speak about their own problems for the fear of being labelled a psychopath. As if being in a perennial conflict with our own head were a shame, as if it were our fault. As if being sick were a shame, when the real shame are these people who spend their time taking candy from a baby. \n\nI do not care if this post will be seen by my family, my friends or even some girl I want to date. If somebody cares about you, they care about you for who you are. That's it. If you do not want to deal with or if you don't wanna fuck me because I publicly admit I suffer from anxiety and I do activism regarding this matter, because there is a stigma about people having mental illnesses... it's your fucking business. You are the ones losing out. I may lose someone along the way, but I have the awareness that with time I will achieve something much bigger: succeeding in life relying on both my strengths and my weaknesses.\n\nHave a nice day and a hug to you all.",

            "selftext": "I wish I knew how to explain to people that anxiety isn\u2019t something that you want. It\u2019s not something you just wake up one day and decide to have. It\u2019s not romantic and it\u2019s not cute. It\u2019s fucking scary and it\u2019s absolute, unending, crushing instability that you wish you could rip from yourself. \n\nI don\u2019t know where people got this insane idea that anxiety is this cute little quirk that makes them more desirable to the opposite sex, but if you really want to have it that badly, take mine. I could do without it for a while. \n\nPeople with real anxiety issues don\u2019t tell anyone about the crushing weight that settles on them because they don\u2019t want to seem as if they are one of those people who tries to romanticize the idea of a mental disorder like it\u2019s something that we can fix with a kiss on the forehead and a boyfriend\u2019s hoodie. I would rather pour acid on myself than have people see the panic attacks like the one I had tonight at work. At least then I could scream like I want to and people wouldn\u2019t question it or act like I was crazy.\n\nIf you have even an inkling that anxiety is some romantic, adorable thing, I want you to imagine this for a moment: Imagine you are standing in the middle of your work day, doing something as meaningless as sorting clothing. You\u2019re working alone. No one is bothering you, no one is near you. It\u2019s something you do every single day and there is nothing different happening. Suddenly and without warning or reason, the room starts to spin. Your chest gets tight, you feel like you can\u2019t breathe. and your whole body starts to shake. You feel like you\u2019re losing your grip on reality. You can\u2019t calm down and you can\u2019t bring yourself back from the edge. There\u2019s no reason for it. Nothing happened. Nothing. You were thinking about something completely trivial - Christmas and your family holiday. You rush to the restroom, trying to make sure your face doesn\u2019t betray even half of what you are feeling. And in the restroom, you huff and puff and lean against the wall and try with all your might to calm down and stop sweating and stop panicking over absolutely nothing. You try for what feels like hours but is something more like five minutes. And then even though the only thing you\u2019ve succeeded in doing is straightening your clothes and making the room stop spinning, you have to go back to your work, even with a heavy chest and ringing in your ears, because if you stay gone too long, someone will know you\u2019re crazy or think you\u2019re wasting time. \n\nDo you really want this? Do you really want this to be your reality every day? Because this is what I go through. This was my night at work. This is what people with real and lasting anxiety issues go through every single day of their lives. \n\nYou can try to romanticize something as hellish as someone\u2019s every day demise. You can try to make yourself seem adorable by acting awkward and shy when you really aren\u2019t. But for God\u2019s sake don\u2019t wish for something that real people everywhere would set themselves on fire to get rid of every single day. Don\u2019t ask to have something that envelopes people in complete nothingness for hours, days, weeks on end, something that takes years of medication and therapy and conditioning just to control. \n\nAnd if you do suffer from this hellish misery, please know that you aren\u2019t alone and there are others who struggle with this every day. You aren\u2019t crazy. You aren\u2019t a baby. It\u2019s real and it\u2019s there. I am sorry you are dealing with this plight. You are stronger than this and you will make it through. I promise.  ",

Strange how it works with humans.
