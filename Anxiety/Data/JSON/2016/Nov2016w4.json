You'll have weeks were you feel very low anxiety, then weeks were you feel very high anxiety, with no real reason or explanation why.\n\nSo say when you feel low anxiety, your baseline is say a 0 or a 1, and doing an anxiety inducing event may add 4 to that point bringing you up to 4 or 5 out of 10.\n\nBut when you have high baseline anxiety, you're a 3 to 4 pretty much resting and an anxiety event raises that to say a 7 or 8 out of 10. \n\nSo on the 'low anxiety' days you can do anxiety inducing events, but on the high anxiety days you're pretty much a wreck before you even start and feel dizzy, lethargic, upset stomach, tension headache etc just by doing nothing.\n\nIts incredibly frustrating and I don't know what creates such a variance.",

I admit I'm pretty nervous to talk about all this, so bear with me. \n\nI'm a first year university student and I feel like my world is sort of falling apart. I've been stressed about choosing the right program, and I do like (I guess?) what I am enrolled in as of right now, but this is where my thoughts always spiral. \n\nI know I'm very lucky and extremely privileged, as my parents are fully supportive and are able to pay for the cost of my undergrad degree. I don't want to come off as trying to rub it in people's faces, I'm just writing this down for some background info. However, this causes me extreme stress as I feel as though I am wasting their money pursing a degree that I may not want to continue with in the future. \n\nI also feel guilty because I've been finding the workload pretty intense, so I've had to quit my job I've had for two years, and I feel like I'm not putting enough \"responsibility\" on myself if that makes sense. Sure I'm going to work during the summer, but I feel like I'm kind of taking the easy road, and my grades have fallen a lot (going from low 90s to 70s) despite me having more spare time to study. \n\nI feel like my life is going nowhere, which I know sounds dumb for someone in first year, but I'm always afraid that I'm not smart enough or putting enough effort in and screwing everything up. I get pretty anxious at night which keeps me up, and this feeling only slightly subsides during the day. I have these thoughts pretty much every day, and I tend to worry about everything anyways so it's really exhausting. \n\nI'm not sure if I regret the choices I've made (quitting my job, my program choice, the school I went to) or if I'm being irrational. I'm feeling pretty hopeless about everything...\n\nMy mind is always everywhere and I'm not really sure if I should ask for help because \n1. I wouldn't even know what to say? Or who to go to? A family doctor? \n2. I feel like there are others who have it so much worse than me and have real stressors in their life, that I feel like I'm kind of being a whiny child. \n3.I feel like I'm kind of a lost cause because nothing is really wrong in my life, looking from an objective standpoint. I have it good, so I don't really deserve to be sad/ stressed? I'm not sure. \n3. How do I know if I have anxiety? I've been feeling this level of stress for a long time, probably since the end of grade 11, but it's only recently where I've pinpointed it down to school as a major cause. Usually I'm just anxious about everything, is there a test that doctors can do on me? \n\nThanks for reading this. ",

Then it hit me - I didn't have any plans. No pressure. No waking up early. No pretending to like food that I don't really want to eat.\n\nI'm going to wake up whenever I want, cook and eat whatever I want (still Thanksgiving food but more of what I like and less of what I don't like!), and do whatever I want. I get to be alone! I will probably spend the day cuddling my dog, playing video games, and maybe taking a short hike. My dog will also be getting a special Thanksgiving meal of fresh meat and veggies.\n\nWe feel so much pressure to celebrate birthdays or holidays like this, and a lot of the time it becomes a source of anxiety and expectations. It becomes less of a holiday and more like a chore. We should let ourselves have a real holiday from time to time. \n\nI'm so excited. ",

My therapist told me about the possibility of taking drugs, and I totally agreed with that from the beginning. So I started to see a psychiatrist to help me with this issue.\n\n24 hs after taking the first half pill, the intrusive thoughts disappeared. The second realization was that I could remember things faster. My eloquence came back and I stopped mixing words when I am talking.\n\nI became pro-active without thinking about the tasks so much. Things I was avoiding all the time because I was thinking I was lazy, I can do it right away. Even it works with people, normally friends or family. I don't want to avoid them anymore with silly excuses.\n\nThe most important part is: I can see the canvas of the future again and draw on it my dreams and projects one more time.\n\nIt is too early to come to conclusions, I know, but I wanted to express my joy to live again a normal life.",
