My entire life suddenly changed and this caused a lot of stress and anxiety.\n\nSince October last year I've constantly been extremely stressed out and I haven't been able to sleep. It felt like I was living in the hotel check-in scene from Fear and Loathing In Las Vegas. I was hard on the way to get kicked off of the school and get blacklisted, and this fear consumed my life or the past 9 months. \n\nWhat would I do next? I had nowhere to go.  How would my parents react? Probably furiously. \n\nSo in a last-effort attempt to save my ass I sent a letter to the dean to ask for a second chance next year, which is something that only happens in very special cases. \n\n\n\nToday I got an e-mail.\n\n\n\nIt was the dean.\n\n\n\nI can start over next year.\n\n\n**FUCK**\n\n\n\n**YES**\n\n\n\n\n\n",

She knows I'm going to miss her a lot. We have a really strong connection.\n\nI asked her if we could be friends when I come back for graduate school and she said of course. That we could grab coffee or go get dinner occasionally. I told her that I don't want to be a burden to her in any way, and she promised that I wasn't being one. I didn't want her to feel obligated to have a friendship with me, since there is quite a difference in age (about 20 years) between us. \n\nI'm going to miss her so much, but knowing this makes me feel so much better. She's the most compassionate and genuine person I've ever met. It makes me so happy I don't have to lose her forever :)",

Being ugly is not a fact. It's an opinion. So just because you think you're ugly, it doesn't mean everybody else does. Just because one or more people think you are ugly, it doesn't mean that everybody does.\n\nBeauty is in the eye of the beholder, you can't change the level of attractiveness that one person has for you, and nor can they. So why spend time worrying about something that nobody can change? (boy I wish it was that simple.) \n\nSo yeah today I walked to the shop with that in mind and it just seemed to be such a huge confidence booster for me. I'm hoping it can be for you guys too, even if it is for just one person out there. If anyone ever compliments your beauty, don't reject it. Embrace it. \n\nEdit: Edit: I'm giving out advice that's helped another anxiety sufferer (ok its me) so if you want to reject it, fine. You can only help yourself, nobody can force you to help yourself.",

            "selftext": "I am a singer-songwriter who performs regularly on various stages across the country. I suffer from social anxiety, which deters me from many normal type social settings, but I am able to get on stage and perform and talk with fans after the shows successfully because I have figured out a way for me to handle myself and my neuroses. \n\nThe main element of my coping mechanism is that when I get in the car and am driving to wherever the show is that night, I am preparing myself mentally much in the way a method actor would prepare for a role. I immerse myself in this \"stage persona\", that is, the person who is outgoing and emotionally vulnerable and entertaining. By the time I get to wherever I am playing that night, I am essentially acting. I am playing the role of an outgoing extroverted version of myself. From the stage, I am able to exude the confidence as if I were an actor in a play, allowing my fears and insecurities to remain safely hidden away for nobody to find. I only give them what I want to give them. I feel I have complete control over this outgoing person that I am portraying. \n\nBy the end of the night, when I get in my car to go home or to the hotel or wherever, I remove the metaphorical mask and breathe a sigh of relief as I made it through another evening unscathed. I usually drive in silence, allowing myself to begin the recharging process. \n\nOver the years, it has gotten a bit easier to get into character and handle the intensities of being in that limelight, but it is still something I consciously do and it has allowed me to have a career as an entertainer. I love playing music more than anything else and I would be devastated if I had let my fears and anxieties stand in the way of that. \n\nGive it a try sometime. Perhaps the next time you venture out to a bar with friends, or a situation in which you are reluctant to participate. \n\nYou are strong enough, you have to believe it. \n\nI hope this will help someone. Feel free to ask any questions. ",

            "selftext": "Hi,\n\nFirst of all, let me introduce myself. I'm 28 years old male and working as a senior software engineer. I'm good looking, live in a 3 floor house (doublex). My family is middle class, all alive and healthy. I saved enough money to purchase a flat just in 2 years. I have passive income from the games/projects I developed in the past. I have no trouble finding jobs. I can speak english like my native language and I am overall pretty smart, as I taught myself everything alone. English before I was 10, software engineering before I was 20 and I am still learning new stuff every day. I don't smoke, I don't do drugs, I don't do anything that is bad for my body or my life. If I am driving, I always stay below the speed limit just incase a wild animal appears on road from nowhere so I could brake quicker to save his life. People act like \"Come on... it will take ages for us to reach our destination. Speed up a bit.\" but I reject it. We can be late but we can save an animals life unknowingly and prevent outselves from compunction. I am very emotional but usually I follow my logic.\n\nWhen I bring my issues up, people act like I'm bleufing and tell me that I should be happy because they just don't believe me and always bring the \"There are people whom is in worse conditions than you, feel better.\" card. I just can't be happy. Every single day I feel closer and closer to a suicide and lately I'm thinking about what kind of suicide I should prefer. Seriously, all I want to do is get on top of a mountain during midnight, lay down, watch the space for a hour in complete silence thinking I'll be the last man alive on my entire birth chain, close my eyes and let myself fall down... I'm not kidding the slighest. I've always been suicidal but recently it got to a point where a it all matters on one-second decision.\n\nI don't know what is wrong with me but I will write my symptoms so perhabs you can help me identify my issues and seek treatment.\n\n---\n\nDuring my childhood I always ripped my eyebrows and hair. Half of my head was bald and I had no eyebrows until highschool. My parents moved me from a physocologist to another because they didn't know why I did it. My parents are very protective. I'm getting close to 30 and they still call me every hour. Where are you? Whom are you with? What did you ate? How much you paid? It is sickening. As a result, I have no friends because nobody wants someone like this in their group. The only friend I have is a guy whom I know since birth. We were raised together, went to same school together and he is like a brother to me. You may think it is a good thing because true friends are hard to find. Let me clarify. He is the only one I went out for a walk for the past 3 years, the one I talked on phone. I just don't have anyone except my family and this guy. No school friends, noone in neighbourhood, nothing. This brought me another issue: I can't stand being in group of people. I've never been to a walk or sit on a table where there are more than 2 people.\n\nIn addition, I'm also having mini-heart attacks even if a leaf drops next to me because I am so used to silence. A small sound such as a leaf-drop makes me jump from my chair. This grew another level of weirdness: I hide under my bed when it is stormy outside and I plug my earphones with maximum volume so I don't hear thunder volume/see the light. Those mini heart attacks/shocks started to hurt. I black out for like a second. My heart always aches. When I go outside and it is about to rain, I am literally closing my eyes and praying it doesn't start raining before I get to home. When I get to home I instantly plug my earphones and hide under my bed. The worst part is, I had to do this when there are people in my house. Everyone was like \"Wow... how disrespectful!\" but they just can't understand the fact that I'm not doing this intentionally. I lock my room's door so nobody can see me hiding under the bed.\n\nThere is one more thing I fear so much: getting laughed. God knows how many times people laughed me and thought I was some kind of a loser in my entire lifetime. \"A guy whom hides under his bed, haha. What a loser.\" People gave me all the weird nicknames on high school and made fun of me. Dead, zombie, graveyard, funeral, corpse, coffin... anything. My teachers were always proud of me and told my family that I could learn things in the future but not grow a decent personality like this. I wasn't good at school because I went my way. People would study biology, physics, math as our school curriculum consisted it. I would escape school to play games and do programming.\n\nAnyhow, after spending an entire life in front of my PC alone, in silence, I had alot of time to question everything. Nowadays, I'm in a complete emptiness. I was religious but I stopped caring about religion. I loved humananity but seeing how I was always abused I stopped caring about humanity. I stopped caring about my nation. I don't care about traditions. There are always huge crashes in me. I want to break my chains, I want to do something; on the other hand, I can't make decisions because I love my family so much and I don't want to be without them.\n\nMy mind is full of negative stuff. It started to be a problem in everything about my life. For example, my company (where I work remotely) planned a trip to another country in this december, all expenses paid. I bet everyone would be amazed to hear it. Me? I keep dreaming about plane crashes, I keep dreaming about being put into prison for something I didn't do, I keep dreaming about how I will get scammed and physically hurt. Worst part? My coworkers whom never saw me before but always appreciated my skills, may notice what kind of weird guy I am. A guy escaping to it's hotel and laying under bed just because there are some rain clouds on the sky. I won't be able to be with them and it will always put me behind everything. I will be a random stranger in the company while they all become friends.\n\nWait, there is alot more. I always feel worthless. My family tells me to find someone and marry as I'm almost 30 and have a job. Are they kidding??? I can't even make eye contact with anyone. I never spoke to a woman (except my mother and few relatives) on my entire lifetime nor touched anyone's hand. Whenever I tried to do it I laughed to me face. For the past 15 years I didn't even say \"Hi\" to anyone. I'm still a virgin. I can't even do anything sexually. I will never do it with money either because I am sure I will question what made her do it for money. I will never abuse someone just because life was harsh to them. I will dream about her birth, her mother holding her and wishing a good future for her. You know what, people laugh when I say it but who the fuck cares. It is either full white or full black to me - there is no gray, and I will stand by what I believe to be true.\n\nPeople are greedy. (well, science also says so) They dream about marrying, buying a car, having a house, growing kids, earning more money etc. I will never marry, I'm not confident enough and I fear not being able to protect her. Even if a miracle happens I happen to marry someone; thinking about dancing in front of people during my wedding increases my heartbeat and makes my hands shake. Did I tell you how I stopped caring about tradition and it is all black or white to me? I'll simply tell her about not making a wedding and tell everyone that they should feed 4 animals/children instead of buying us presents. (I always do those weird stuff and annoy traditional people. Their stupid beliefs make me laugh.) Rejected? Okay. White or black after all. Bye. She will feel like she is going to die in the first week and forget it on the second.\n\nI don't care about money. You will laugh at me... but few days ago I almost burned all my savings (valued approx $300K in United States) because I was pissed off. Decided to break my phone into pieces instead and told me mother to hide them somewhere I can't react so I don't do stupid things when I'm angry. A guy telling his mother to hide his own money, all my savings for years, so he doesn't burn them for fun. I sure sound normal, right?\n\nThe negativity I have is unbelivable but people think I'm just bleufing. My company wanted to give me a salary raise this year but wanted me to sign few papers for legal purposes. I rejected. When I sign papers I feel like it will be used to scam me (as our family had troubles with this in the past) so I reject everything. Currently, I work without a contract, which means I'm not working legally/I'm an illegal worker in terms of law.\n\nI always question everything. There are like hundreds of questions on my mind at any given time. What's the purpose of life? What is the purpose of gods? When will my family die? When will I kill myself? How should I kill myself? How can I tell people to fuck off during my funeral? How can I reject the \"funeral tradition\"? Should I write a death note and tell them to not make any funerals for me or my ghost will chase them eternally? Should I be buried or be burned in a crematorium? Where should I ask them to bury me in? Believe me, even at the most normal days, I think those like hundreds of times in a single day.\n\nMy parents were so strict about me and it could be \"one of the\" reasons why I became like this. I'm allowed to bicycle but only on the road next to our house so they can watch me. Not when I was 6 or 7. When I was 19 years old grown adult. I went to a school trip in my early 20's and they wanted me to call them every hour and give reports. My friend sometimes makes jokes about this situation and asks me if I am going to call my mother when I lose my virginity. \"Yeah mother, she has a hole. We're still at the oral part. She went to bedroom to take her clothes off.\" Like, what? He is joking but that is the truth, sadly.\n\nIn addition, I was always compared to other people. The random girl in neighbourhood whom scored A on exam, my father's friend's son whom was a decent soccer player. I never had a compliment until I started making money from my hobby. (programming) Nowadays they act like: \"Come on, why are you so negative? You're making a decent amount of money and your job is a great skill in today's world.\" Fuck the money if my family questions every single purchase I make. I can't even go out and have a nice dinner alone because they would complain and tell me that I could eat X instead which costs less. (remember that I told you our family had some troubles legally. We had to pay loads of money for something WE DON'T KNOW) I'm sick of this but on the other hand... I understand why they are like this. They don't even turn the light on so we could lower our electricity bill a bit. I don't blame them, because the next day our phone may ring once again and all my savings could be gone the next day.\n\nSo, the crashes in me... Should I live freely or support my family till the end? Should I move to another country and finally break my chains and start a new life, or should I keep staying with them till the end? Should I be ignorant like everyone else, follow traditions, marry, breed, be happy, or continue doing whatever I believe to be correct and honorable? Why should I care about people's validation if I decide to ignore all of them and live happily with loads of dogs in a completely isolated wooden house? Humans in my eyes (except a minority) are virus. Their genes are greedy. They are greedy. They will destroy the planet they live in. They will blame you if you tell them their beliefs and traditions are stupid. They will spit on roads, they will rage during traffic, they will tailgate you, they will laugh at your face when they get the chance, they will scam innocent people.\n\nMy anxiety is so intense. I can't even go to a 1 week all-expenses-paid company trip. I just can't guys... I fear everything. I can only work in remote because I hate open-space environment. I hate asking for private room either because it makes me feel bad when there are others working in open space. I'm not special. I feel bad when I treated differently. I rejected many jobs because of this (not offers, but when they told me to stay tomorrow. I took my papers and left the building) although I was jobless and were treated like a shit for a very long time.\n\nCollapse over collapse, crash over crash and I grew a severe anger problem. The guy in traffic did something wrong, opened his window and blamed you? My eyes turn red, my body starts shaking, every single hatred I grew for humanity instantly adds up to my anger. I want to crash his car intentionally. I want to hit his car over and over again. I want to pull him out and punch him until he learns basic traffic rules. I fear myself hurting someone because I hate people who abuse innocent living beings. You may say, \"We all feel the same, traffic makes the people angry.\" If you ever chased a car just to intentionally hit from behind, let me know.\n\nNo, I'm a calm guy, really. I just instantly explode with anger on certain circumstances, especially when people are wrong but they believe they are correct and want to take advantage of abusing the innocent one.\n\nI also don't forget anything negative. If someone tells me \"Oh hey mate, we didn't see eachother for the last 25 years. How are you doing?\" I can simply tell them that to fuck off just because they told me stupid and laughed my face 25 years ago. People's instincs never change. If they abused someone whom was weaker than them once, they will continue doing in the future.\n\nSo, here I am. Perfectly normal looking guy with a good job, family and a bright future, yet there is a complete chaos and clashes inside me that nobody can see. Why should I care about a car, or a house, or a wife, or fame, or compliments, or money, or life itself when an epic ending to million years old life chain sounds much more tempting? The only reason I don't do it right now is because I don't want to make my family feed bad after my death. It must be a terrible feeling for my parents to lose their son.\n\nLastly, I can't remember things anymore. Half of my thoughts are real, half of them are just made up assumptions. I am leaving house, coming back to check the door. A minute later I forget if I checked it, coming back to check it again. A minute later, once again and this time for good.\n\nWhen I google my symptoms up I get alot of results. Severe anxiety, socialphobia, paranoid anxiety, astraphobia, panic attack, borderline personality disorder, even early levels of schizophrenia.\n\nWhat do you think about my issues? Should I write a small note (a summary of everything I wrote here) and bring it with me to my physotherapist?\n\nSorry for the long post. Wanted to give details as much as I can.\n\nThank you.",

            "selftext": "I'd had enough. I walked into the doctors last Thursday, and asked if they had any appointments. When the receptionist said they didn't have any appointments for a month, she asked if I was well. \n\nI said \"Mentally, no.\"\n\nShe made me an appointment the next morning. I didn't know this was a thing. I didn't know I could go in and say my life was slipping away from me and they'd actually take me seriously. \n\nI went home, and I told my wife. I'd love to say either of us broke down but honestly, she was just relieved and supportive. I just felt tired.\n\nI realised that anxiety had become a lens through which I viewed the world. A shield that had somehow grown into a wall. I had been scared of taking antidepressants for so long because I thought they would change who I am, without realising the anxiety was already doing that. \n\nI went to the doctor and told her the problem. Living with my sister-in-law is hard, but my anger and reaction to her has grown wildly disproportionate over time. The doctor asked if I thought about killing myself, but I said I was more worried about the stress giving me a heart attack than anything else. She wrote it all down, weighing up i'm sure which drug would cover the most (or at least the most important) problems. \n\nShe gave me a prescription, and I started taking it a few days ago. She said it would take about a month, 6 weeks to really kick in. But just taking something, telling someone I need help, has given me hope that i'll get better, i'll be a good husband again, get a job and get us out of here. ",

            "selftext": "Hi all,\n\nI was hardwired at a very young age into thinking that you cannot succeed at everything and that something bad will happen to you if you do. \n\nI have this memory of being a child (maybe 7-8) in my parents' car as we were driving through this rich neighborhood, and I saw a beautiful house by the water and told my mom: look how nice that house is, and my mom replied: \"well that guy probably is dying of cancer or something. You cannot succeed at everything in life\". \n\nI'm 35 today and I'm realizing that this phrase has affected me deeply. I can't blame her though because her mother told her the same thing so it's passed down every generation. Also this was something a lot of people said and believed in when I was a child, not just in my family. \n\nNow I'm reaching a point in my life where I feel like I CAN succeed in everything. I won't get into details but basically all the doors are open in front of me but I'm afraid of opening them. Basically I'm self-destroying myself to make sure that at least something is wrong in my life. How horrible is that? Whenever everything is too good I tend to develop anxiety and start looking for things that are wrong. When people congratulate me for having done something great, I am anxious instead of happy. I'm constantly worried about my health and cancer and heart issues when things are too good.\n\nHere is where I'm at today:\n\n- I know that you definitely CAN succeed at everything if you want to. The world is full of examples of people that lived happily and died past 80 peacefully in their sleep in their large beautiful mansion surrounded by a large loving family. \n\n- I understand 100% that this is a wrong through pattern ingrained in me from childhood and I wish I could detach myself from it.\n\nWhat do you guy suggest? Any way I can either detach myself from this type of thinking and see it as \"an external entity\" and not part of myself, or perhaps change the way I view it somehow? \n\nAny modern psychotherapy approach could work in this case? CBT or any of that stuff? Or perhaps a technique I can practice daily to ignore these thoughts?\n\nAt this point I'm considering an Ayahuasca or Iboga psychedelic experience to try and dive into this inner world of mine and figure out how to deal with it because it's making me unhappy and I'm only living at like 50% of my true potential.\n",

I definitely have performance anxiety and feel like I'm walking into something I have to be perfect at.  I know this isn't the case and I am really trying to stay calm but these kinds of things are really hard for me.  Telling myself it won't be as bad as I think it is makes me more anxious because what if it is.  \n\nAnyway, figured I'd post here as way to get these thoughts out and calm myself.

            "selftext": "I've had generalized anxiety my whole life, but the last few years have been focused on falling behind. I'm 23, graduated college with a bachelor's last year and have a good job in the design field. But it never seems good enough. I always worry that my job isn't design oriented enough (I have a lot of administrative duties) and I am falling behind. I fear that if/when I ever need to get a new job, I won't have the skills. I don't want to leave my job though..the pay is decent, I have a set amount of hours, and for the most part (other than the crippling anxiety which would come regardless), I can leave work at work. I know I have it pretty good but my anxiety refuses to let me calm down.\n\nI thought maybe selling designs on Etsy would help with the anxiety...I could do this to keep up with new designs and make some extra money. But I recently read that people are cracking down on trademarks and copyrights, which pretty much everything is now and I have an extreme amount of anxiety about getting sued. So, so much for that.\n\nSo now that Etsy fell through because I'm terrified, I don't feel like I'm doing anything productive at home. It's like I always need to be productive and work on improving my skills otherwise I freak out. It's exhausting and no matter what I do to improve those skills, I'm not even sure if they're the right ones to be improving.\n\nMy social anxiety makes it worse because I don't want to ask for advice from anyone in person. I wouldn't even know where to start with looking for a mentor to help guide me...\n\nAny advice on how to calm these thoughts?",
