I've seen so much downvoting lately that it is really starting to irk me. Why are you here? Is it because you need help, or would like to help others get through hard times? When someone asks for help, even though you don't see eye to eye with their problem, you shouldn't be downvoting them, period. We are all struggling individuals trying to figure life out, and it may be more confusing to some than to others. Putting people down asking for help is just mind boggling to me. If someone gives bad advice, don't downvote, reply with your opinion so that OP has information from different points of view. We are here to seek help and to give help. If you're not here for that, please excuse yourself and be a civil human being. So many people are hurting, and seeing them put down even further in places they are trying to seek guidance just doesn't make sense. Everyday I struggle with my issues, but when I see someone asking for help, I still try and take the time to use my negatives for them to try and find a positive, or make sense of what they are going through.

            "selftext": "I started Effexor and therapy about 5-6 weeks ago and feel happy and so much less stressed. I wasn't depressed before so that wasn't an issue for me but the anxiety (GAD and OCD) made me feel consumed. I am still titrating the medicine and have one more step to go but I already feel so much better. The OCD has been improved. I don't obsess over every negative thing in my life anymore and I don't compulsively lock the car doors anymore. I was able to work through it yesterday and even though I was questioning if I did it or not, I just stopped myself from obsessing about it and it helped stop the compulsion of going back out to re-lock them. The therapy helps so much too because being genuinely heard and not judged is so refreshing. \n\nThere's no point in my post other than to let others know there's hope and to not give up on your journey to a life with less anxiety.

            "selftext": "I wrote a reply to someone elsewhere about my anxiety -- and it made me think about finally speaking about it more publicly. Perhaps some people can benefit from my long, embarrassing, terrifying journey. The pictures in this post merely represent improvement over time, although the video would help a lot more, I am not sure if I should publish them or not, at least yet.\n\nMy journey with anxiety still continues after five years, but at varying points I have had improvements. \n\nI lost a job as a result of anxiety, and gradually anxiety took over my life, ending up pure agoraphobic. I did not leave my house for 3 months, and then a few months later I agreed to take Fluoxetine (Prozac). \n\nI started at a mere 1mg because I believed that the medication would make me worse, and result in my death. Gradually I rose it over a few weeks until I [finally took my first full pill](http://i.imgur.com/TFWnfA7.jpg). \n\nTo be honest, it gave me headaches but I did sometimes get a feeling of different peace. But then I would often feel quite hyperactive. I started walking to places again, but was probably still using a lot of alcohol at the time.\n\nAt certain times I would also use Propranolol but was convinced it would also kill me. One day I managed to have dental work done, but they gave me 2 diazepam (10mg). The feeling from those finally gave me a feeling of freedom for the first time. I was no longer inside the zone of anxiety.\n\nA couple of months past by, and I started acquiring it. Eventually I was taking about 10-15mg/day, and the doctors wanted me off it, so I decided to taper. Eventually I was off that and onto Pregabalin, as it helped the side effects. Pregabalin definitely helped me and was the first medication I liked besides the previous diazepam.\n\nI have also taken citalopram and hated it, and flipped out and went on an 8 hour bike ride hoping it would come out of my system. Although I have had similar thoughts before. Sometimes I would freak out and think maybe if i slit my wrists I could bleed out a chemical or something. I guess that is why I was eventually put on something called Early Intervention for Psychosis.\n\n**I didn't leave my town for 4 years.**\nI used a lot of alcohol. I had incidents were I passed out and the usual stuff, and I believed that ultimately, I was going to die. I had nightmares daily about dying in plane crashes. There mere noise of a bus began to eat away at me. I believed that death would be an option, however I never truly acted upon it with intention.\n\nI decided to take Sertraline at the recommendation of multiple doctors, and all I can say with regards to that is it did help me a bit. Gradually I started walking further. But to be honest, I have become very apathetic on it and feel it is time to stop. Not to mention it gives me slight diarrhea sometimes. No headaches though. \n\nInterestingly once I started sertraline, I started therapy, and had a worker within the NHS that drove me to see the sea. [For the first time in 5 years I could hear the waves](http://i.imgur.com/Ya38rRK.jpg) -- it was an incredibly experience as quite honestly I believed I should have been dead.\n\nI was on 100mg/day, I'm now on roughly 12.5mg. [I caught a bus for the first time and went ...maybe 1/4 of a mile.](http://imgur.com/PVgAmUh) But that was a success also.\n\nI'm a bit more stable these days, however I have relapsed on benzos. At the end of the day benzos are *fucking effective*. They are the gold standard for anxiety. The problem I have right now is I probably should taper but tbh I do not see the point right now -- as I am presently on sertraline still, including ~30-40mg propranolol, ~400mg pregabalin and 10-30mg diazepam.\n\nI eventually overcame my fear of propranolol and it actually proved fairly useful. Infact in some cases it is more useful than a benzo... sort of.\n\nToday I am slightly more stable IMO, and propranolol and diazepam and pregabalin maintain stability for now. I'd like to try and just decrease all of the drugs in my system. Although some people take way more than me :)\n\nRecently I finally had the courage to travel in a car to other places. [I sat in a city and had no anxious thoughts. I was present.](http://i.imgur.com/SevUSRR.jpg). \n\nI am determined to beat this, and I hope my story and pictures can illustrate how when you are in your darkest moment, [there is a chance to see the light](http://i.imgur.com/W1dttSj.jpg). \n\nYou can get better, although I am still on that journey myself. We must learn from each other. \n\nPersonally I am slowly coming to terms with the idea I may eventually die, and as such have prepared this however I am determined to live. Good luck to you all.",

Or thinking about dropping/throwing my phone or keys down a drain, but I also get really really bizarre ones. The weirdest one is when I walk past a wall that is around eye level or a sharp corner on a shelf or something similar I get this horrible vision of me slicing my eye on it and it makes me really panicked more so than the others do, I have no idea where this thought stems from but it's so bizarre and causes me far too much stress. Does anyone else get weird intrusive thoughts like this? \n\nI spoke to my therapist about intrusive thoughts in the past and she didn't really understand what I meant or offer any way of helping them so any ideas as to how to help shut them up would also be greatly appreciated.

They aren't big lies and I'm not actively trying to manipulate people, but I regularly lie to other people as a way to protect myself.\n\nFor example, I'm embarrassed about a TV show I like, so if someone asks I tell them I like something else that I deem as more socially acceptable. Or a friend asks to hang out and I tell them I have to work instead of just telling them I don't feel like doing anything. Or my Mom asks how my work is going and I tell her \"it's going well\" because I don't want her to worry.\n\nAll of these little lies are some lame attempt to control what others think about me and maintain my reputation. This creates stress as it requires mental energy to maintain the false versions of myself that I am presenting to various people.\n\nI'm not saying there is no place for lies, although I think radical honesty is worth contemplating and experimenting with. Regardless, I need to start being more honest with people. I guess the only thing holding me back is the uncomfortableness and fear of rejection (which is definitely the source of my social anxiety).\n\nI'm interested in hearing others' thoughts on this. I have relatively mild social anxiety. I've made some big strides the past few years and I feel like tackling this honesty problem could be another big step for me.",

I have never even had a boyfriend in my life.\n\nI've had \"friend with benefits\" who in reality were not friends and have not benefitted me. I can see now I was used a practice girl before they moved onto women they actually care about.\n\nI have social anxiety and hate myself so expect others to hate me too. Things like eye contact are very difficult. I use alcohol as a tool to try and be fun but it never really works out. Not fishing for compliments here just being straight up : I am not a good looking woman so this also doesn't help. \n\nLast year I decided to take the plunge and started online dating as I find typing easier than talking. I went on my first ever date last year. I went on a few very unsuccessful ones but eventually found what I'm looking for. He is kind, funny, caring, compassionate and understanding of all my crazy. The first night he put his arms around me I freaked out - no one has ever done that to me before. Then I realised what it was and it is the single happiest memory I have. I felt so safe and lucky to be the one he chose in that moment.\n\nOn the night i plucked up the courage to say \"I love you\" for the first time in my life, he dumped me before i got that far. I'm not angry, I don't blame him, he just didn't feel the same way I do.\n\nIt's left me absolutely broken. I believe im not good enough for anyone and don't see the point in going on anymore. I just go through the motions every day without feeling anything. \n\nI am on meds and see a doctor regularly but nothing helps. I tried counselling and could not talk. I have a history involving suicide and sexual assault and so trust is hard for me. \n\nI don't know where to go from here. ",

I really think for most people there may be things to try before going on meds. \n\nI wanted to share a few of those things, in an event it helps someone out there in my similar situation.\n\nI'm 33yo. Wife. 2 small kids. Self employed.\n\n1. I started meditating every. single. day. This is by far the most influential factor. r/meditation to learn more. \n2. I researched and learned a little bit about CBT online. (Cognitive Behavioral Therapy). I've used this in conjunction with meditation and mindfulness.\nBasically, thoughts are constant and random. Sometimes, we take the negative thoughts (again, completely constant and random) and put a lot of value on them. This, in turn, leads to negative feelings, anxiety and emotions. Usually, these feelings are completely based on nothing.  The goal is to recognize these thoughts as just thoughts. See number 1 in order to better your ability to do this.\n3. I exercise more often. 4 to 5 times a week. This is also key.\n4. I stopped spending most of my free time on my phone/laptop/TV. See #1\n5. I stopped drinking coffee. Switched to tea.\n6. I greatly reduced (very recently) the amount of alcohol I consume. \n7. I've also lowered my caloric intake in general (maybe as a result). I never really ate badly, but if I did eat badly, I would have stopped that. I just eat 'less' now.\n8. Probably the most important, I had a deep down interest to change the way my brain was working and how I was moving through life. Mainly because I didn't want my kids to experience the negative results of my shitty moods/anxiety. \nFeel free to shoot me a PM if you have specific questions. I really hope this may help someone struggling with some degree of anxiety. \n\n",

Now I'm excelling at my job, taking on the world, and am able to do little things I used to not be able to do thanks to some new anxiety meds. I feel like a normal person.  Anyways, I still get severe anxiety about my email inbox.  It's the strangest thing.  Does anyone else experience this?  My job isn't super stressful, but when I see an email come through I get extremely anxious.  Same with my personal emails, especially emails from my freelance clients (I'm working on growing a side business).  I fear the worst and get all anxious and freak out. Anyone have any tips?  I can't seem to get rid of it. ",

I've had a bit of a rough past of abuse from my father which lead to self harming, but thankfully I've recovered from that. I'm still recovering mentally and trying to figure myself out and my bf says I'm being too hard on myself and that I should just \"live.\" I don't know how to do that! I'm constantly in my head and I'm constantly seeking approval for just about anything I do. \nAn example: I do pretty much all the laundry and I took care of a stain on one of my bf's shirts - then asked about 50 times if it was okay that I used ___ stain remover instead of ___ stain remover. \nOr I'll ask to go to the store instead of saying I'm going to the store... I hate this. I hate this automatic response I have where I feel the need to explain my every thought or action.\n\nThis is a bit scattered... sorry about that, but any advice is highly appreciated.",
