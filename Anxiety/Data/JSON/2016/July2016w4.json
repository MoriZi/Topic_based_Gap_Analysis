My hands were shaking as I used the touchscreen to buy my ticket from the automated ticket dispenser, but after a deep breath, I managed to click \"confirm\". \n\nI actually came at a pretty bad time, because the theater was absolutely packed with kids and parents. As a 22 year old male, I stuck out like a sore thumb. Thankfully, the lights were low when I walked in, so nobody even gave me a second glance. \n\nGet this! Since most of the seats were taken, I had to take a seat at the very front! I was extremely self conscious for the first 5 minutes, as I imagined everyone staring at the weirdo without kids who came by himself. As the first trailers started to play, I calmed down a lot, and from then on, it was easy to relax and enjoy the movie. I even laughed along with the rest of the audience during the movie's funny moments.\n\nI am so proud of myself today. I didn't get any rude or mean comments from anybody, and I saw a movie that I've been wanting to see for awhile. This day was completely awesome :)",

This can be anything from putting of school work/opening important emails/dealing with 'serious' things, to silly things like opening texts from friends &amp; replying to them/returning phonecalls etc that don't even feel 'scary' to me at the time. Sometimes this leads to fairly big problems or at least completely avoidable problems that weren't an issue until I'd procrastinated them, or just to things like people getting frustrated with me or me feeling guilty because I take days to reply to people who have just said hi or are being friendly and making an effort to contact me. I don't know if this is somehow related to anxiety and my brain just not wanting to deal with anything til it has to (fyi I have varying levels of anxiety pretty much constantly about a lot of stuff so the procrastination isn't my only 'symptom') or whether I'm just lazy and wanting an excuse to make myself feel better...does anyone else get this?

            "selftext": "So, I woke up this morning from a phone call from my best friend. She was crying and said that her roommate was breaking the lease and she felt pressured into signing(she also has anxiety). \n\nReddit, I have been sulking around since the semester ended. I clean around my parents house and try to do things but I always feel empty by the end of the day (I also have recurrent depression). \n\nAnyway, I digress. I got up, got ready, and went to comfort her. I saw that her problem could be fixed by a new roommate. \n\nI made a call to my sister, who also has anxiety and was job hunting today, asked her if she was still interested in working at a doggy day care that an old friend of mine owns and we applied together. I went home, made a phone call to the old friend(this was hard as I panic over phone calls). She hired my sister and I as soon as I told her we applied. I know, it's kind of cheating to know the owner, but this was huge for me. \n\nAs soon as I got home, I told my mom. She flipped her shit. She was not okay with me getting a job and preparing to save up to find an apartment with a friend. I should point out, I sat down and did some budgeting and found that I could totally live in an apartment with a roommate(it's Tulsa, cheap rent), we're just going to wait a few months, save money and find a new place. \n\nNo one said congratulations or anything. It just happened quickly and I was getting yelled at by the person who I expected to support me.\n\nEventually, I told my best friend, who took the time to say she was really proud of me. \n\nIt feels like everyone else is being cautious and waiting for me to ruin this. I just wanted to get this off my chest. My parents have always fully supported my brothers, who are all older and struggling through life (except one, he's amazing but my parents don't talk to him because he came out years ago. I talk to him every other day). My sister and I always get criticized. \n\nI can't stand it here anymore. I'm saving up and moving to another state (I'm looking at you, Colorado). My family is absolutely toxic. I can never imagine myself coming out to them or telling them I'm not religious. \n\nToday was a big day for me and they were completely awful. I'm so excited for this new job. I feel like this is a great step and actually have some energy to go out today. I actually fought my anxiety today and felt like a different person. I smiled at strangers instead of looking at my feet. I even managed to accept a dinner invitation and go out with another friend. \n\nI'm so proud of myself, Reddit. Sorry if my order is all messed up. I kind of just needed to rant about this.",

            "selftext": "**My Experience with Anxiety**\n\nAnxiety runs in my family. My dad has always had an anxious side to him, and, growing up, I always dealt with social anxiety, fear of public speaking and humiliation, fear of the future, intrusive thoughts about death of myself and those I love, and more. I had always been able to manage it until last year.\n\nIn December of 2015, I suffered a really bad panic attack that sent me to the ER in an ambulance. It was the scariest moment in my life. I truly thought that I was dying from a heart attack. I spent a couple of hours in the ER, but was eventually calmed down and sent home. Following this event, I suffered through a couple months of awful anxiety. I had continued panic attacks and terrible symptoms (you can read about some of my experiences in my previous posts [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/howtonotgiveafuck/comments/4anzt1/if_you_live_in_a_state_of_constant_worry_your/), [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/4c1zx1/the_irony_of_anxiety_and_the_vicious_cycle_that/), and [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/4bhuly/looking_for_help_in_dealing_with_health_anxiety/)).\n\nMy anxiety took over my life completely. I had a hard time functioning on a day-to-day basis, even during normal tasks such as going to work, making breakfast, and sitting on the couch watching TV. It was like having this creature on my back at all times, pestering me with thoughts of my health, life and death, my past, my future, etc. This went on for roughly five or six months or so.\n\n**The Symptoms**\n\nBefore I had that first panic attack, my anxiety had always just been a subtle fear of the world around me; it had never been physical. Following the panic attack, it became incredibly physical. Here's a list of some of the various symptoms that I experienced during the worst of it:\n\n* Sensations in my forehead and chest\n* Heart palpitations\n* Sensitivity to my heart rate\n* Insomnia (this was one of the worst and I discuss it [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/4ruf1o/anxiety_and_insomnia/) and [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/sleep/comments/4sayq5/how_to_deal_with_pseudoinsomnia/))\n* Stomach aches and cramps\n* Diarrhea\n* Dizziness\n* Light-headedness\n* Tightness in my throat\n* Chronic cough\n\nWith each of these symptoms came incredible fear. They all appeared out of nowhere and with each one, I found myself panicking.\n\n**What I Tried**\n\nI took a lot of different approaches to try to relieve the anxiety that had taken over my life. Some of these approaches brought relief, but ultimately, none of them tackled the anxiety at the source.\n\n*Xanax:* This was my crutch. For months, I was on and off the drug, which was a huge mistake. I had become so dependent upon Xanax that it made recovery incredibly difficult. Xanax only helps you manage anxiety, it cures nothing. Taking a Xanax made me feel normal again...until it wore off. Then the anxiety would come rushing back and usually, it would be more intense than before. For more on my Xanax experiences, see [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/4huo9e/xanax_withdrawalmisuse_leading_to_insomnia/) and [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/4md05n/withdrawal_is_very_real_and_its_something_that/).\n\n*Doctors:* As much as I respect doctors and all of the good that they do for the world, anxiety is not their forte. I can't even begin to count the number of doctors that I saw for all of the various symptoms that I experienced. Doctors take a look at physical symptoms and try to determine which medications will help relieve those symptoms. I was told that I had bronchitis, whooping cough, low blood sugar, and (the best of all) nothing wrong at all! I don't think I had a single doctor consider that it might be my anxiety that was causing so many physical symptoms. Please see my advice below for how to utilize your doctor for anxiety.\n\n*Therapy:* I saw a therapist for a couple of weeks. While she helped with some of the underlying causes of the anxiety, it was ultimately just a talk and listen session each time. I would leave each session feeling a bit of relief, but after a day or two, the symptoms would come rushing back. Please see my advice below for how to utilize therapists.\n\n*Family and Friends:* I felt the most amount of comfort throughout all of this when I was surrounded by family and friends. Having other people around me made me feel safe. As soon as I was on my own again, the symptoms would come rushing back.\n\n**What Worked**\n\nAll of the events that unfolded during my bout of anxiety have been necessary for me to reach the place that I am at now. I needed to work through it. I needed to experience the lowest of lows and seek out all of the potential solutions. They've lead me down a path to recovery and, from where I am now, I feel more prepared to take on my life than ever before.\n\nUltimately, it was a book that helped me the most. I recently read [DARE](http://dareresponse.com/) by Barry McDonagh, and it has given me understanding and acceptance like nothing else. Here's why: *recovery from anxiety can only come from yourself through acceptance, rather than resistance.* For months, I fought and fought with my thoughts and my symptoms. I was frustrated over my struggles. I perpetuated how terrible I was feeling by fighting it at every step of the way.\n\nWithout trying to reduce the process too much, once you understand what anxiety is, the symptoms that it can cause, and that it's your behavior that's producing the stress response within your system, you can begin to heal. In reality, anxiety is simply a mixture of hormones and chemicals that are produced by your body in response to situations that it thinks are dangerous. When you're not in any real danger yet you continue to feel high levels of energy and awareness, you're experiencing anxiety. How you respond to these high levels of energy will determine how anxious you will feel. *Anxiety is an attack on your confidence. You will not begin to feel better until you begin to feel confident again.*\n\n**Some Advice**\n\nIf you're living with anxiety, it's okay. A quote from Lord of the Rings stands out to me the most now that I'm beginning to get to the other side of this challenge:\n\n&gt; Full of darkness and danger they were, and sometimes you didn't want to know the end because how could the end be happy? How could the world go back to the way it was when so much bad had happened? But in the end it's only a passing thing this shadow, even darkness must pass. A new day will come, and when the sun shines it'll shine out the clearer. \n\nDuring the worst moments that you'll experience with anxiety, keep pushing onward. Understand that, as much as it seems like it will never end, it will! Here's some of the points of advice that I offer to you based upon my experiences:\n\n* In the midst of your anxiety, avoid caffeine and alcohol. These will only make you feel worse, trust me! Once you get through the anxiety, you can return to them safely.\n* Medications like Xanax, Celexa, and Prozac WILL NOT cure your anxiety; they will only calm you down temporarily. You should use them in moderation, but avoid using them as a crutch.\n* Always see your doctor first. Have your doctor rule out any major health issues. DO NOT EXPECT THEM TO BE THE END ALL BE ALL FOR YOUR ANXIETY. Once they clear you of any major health issues, check that off your list of concerns.\n* If you'd like to see a therapist, find one that understands anxiety. If the therapist is not well-versed in the symptoms and source of anxiety, he or she will not be able to help you reach recovery.\n* Ensure that you're able to get enough sleep each night. Insomnia was a killer for me. I had to reinvent my sleep routine in order to even get any sleep each night. I had periods of several days to a week during which I didn't sleep at all. When you're sleep deprived, your body cannot heal and your mind will be operating at a reduced capacity.\n\nIf you have any questions, please feel free to ask. I highly recommend finding reading material that will explain anxiety in full. I can only summarize what I've experienced and learned in this post. The main point is this: recovery from anxiety must come from within through the regaining of confidence and an understanding and acceptance of the functions of anxiety. Anxiety comes from your behavior. Change your behavior and you will find peace. Good luck!\n\nEDIT: Typo.\n\nEDIT 2: I just want to clarify a couple of things. 1) I am not a doctor, a psychologist, or a psychiatrist, and I have no credentials in terms of a medical or psychological education. I do not think that I stated anywhere that I do. I only have my own experiences and how I managed to work through my anxiety. 2) I am not trying to sell a book. In fact, I don't care if you read that book or any other book or if, in fact, your recovery is aided with the help of a therapist. Again, I am simply describing what helped me understand my anxiety. 3) I am in no way claiming that doctors or therapists do not know what they're talking about. With that being said, however, doctors are not therapists. They can describe to you, from a biological standpoint, what is occurring in your body, but they are not going to help you understand the source of your anxiety. My doctors filled my medicine cabinet with countless prescription drugs, but none of them helped me get to where I am today. I am 100% positive that therapy helps people - it was just not my particular path and it might not be for everyone.\n\nEDIT 3: Thank you for the gold! I've read some good criticism so far. Everyone has good points. Again, I am simply speaking from my own experiences. I am not trying to promote anything or dismiss anything. I also do not mean to imply that anxiety can be \"beaten\" and that once it's done, it's done. I still suffer from anxiety every single day. Now, however, I know how to respond to it. Rather than running to the bathroom out of fear of hyperventilating and passing out, I am able to recognize it for what it is, accept, and dismiss it. This is what I mean by understanding the link between one's behavior and anxiety itself. Regain your confidence, learn how to recognize and understand anxiety for what it is, and you will find yourself in an amazing place. Your symptoms may come and go, but you will at least be prepared for them.",

Usually, this has to do with relationships.\n\nIf I'm in a bad romantic relationship, my friends will hear me complain for a year or so before I work up the courage to breakup, and even then, exes stay in my life for a long time after because I suck at clean breaks. \n\nDon't like my boss? I'll grin and bare it, but throw epic rage fits about it around my friends. I don't have the courage to leave the job because while the boss sucks, the job is good and I'm scared of losing it.\n\nSomeone is taking advantage of me? My current situation. My friends will get me really pumped up to walk away from the situation, but when the time comes, I can't do it. \n\nA lot of times, I'm scared I'll regret walking away from something, be it a boyfriend or an opportunity. I also feel terrible when I let people down. I'm a massive people pleaser. Add a smidgen of sunk costs to this equation, and the person I'm trying to walk away from will find some way to convince me to hang around for a bit longer. It's odd that I keep doing this, when all I've ever felt from walking away from these situations is relief. \n\nMy friends eventually get upset with me. I've even lost friends in the past because they'll hear me complain, but then stay in the situation. I usually get to the point that I just don't talk about it anymore because I don't want to lose their friendship.\n\nI'm feeling pretty alone right now, and anxious because of all the things I've agreed to do for this person who's using me. I plan on telling him this weekend that he can't use me as free labor anymore and I fully intend to make a clean break. He's very manipulative and much older than me, though, and I'm a fool falling for his empty promises because I don't want to regret walking away from this, but I'm determined.\n\nI'm looking for a little encouragement from people who understand, and also for others who struggle with the same thing.\n\nEdit: the thing I'm walking away from is a startup. We had some hiccups and I'm not getting paid, which is understandable, but the workload is killing me. Other, older, wiser people have walked away, leaving me to take on the extra work. The person spearheading this has been talking me out of looking for work or going back to school. I can also tell I'm not getting the whole story from him.
