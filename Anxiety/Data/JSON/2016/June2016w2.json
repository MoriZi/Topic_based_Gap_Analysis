We were due to attend a family event together but, as she has only just started therapy, she didn't feel comfortable in going to the do. \n\nI informed family, some by text due to the time restraints on getting everyone told, some face to face. One members response, not directly to me but another member of family, \"we all suffer with anxiety don't we?\" \n\nSo this got me to thinking, do people actually understand what it's like to have anxiety as an actual mental illness? Do people who might be a bit anxious about having an interview, meeting or something along those lines think that's the only form of anxiety you can have and that when it's over and done with you're miraculously cured? It was a comment that really irked me. \n\nI don't really know what I'm trying to say here but I feel that this is something that gets over looked and that not enough people understand the actual illness where people suffer constantly with this issue and more should be done to help raise awareness so people understand more. \n\nAll I'll say to all of you on here is stay strong use the support you have around you and don't let people's comments about something being daft or stupid or that you're worrying over nothing make you doubt yourself. Be honest and be truthful when people tell you you're stupid tell them you're not don't sit quietly and suffer in silence. ",

            "selftext": "Its so strange because, I know they're not. Like logicaly I know everyone who is just laughing cant be laughing at me. But for some reason its like my knee jerk reaction. And even when I tell myself. \"Hey they're probably not even paying attention to you, you're not even on these peoples radar\" And hey, even if they were, like fuckem. I feel like I *shouldn't* care what people think ideally, but I guess I still do. Anyways, even if I tell myself all the logical reasons why they're probably not laughing at me, or ask myself what the advantage to caring would be, still I, I have this feeling like they are or it still effects me emotionally in one way or another. \n\nI know sometimes, some people might laugh. I'm sometimes awkward or clumsy but \"even the pros mess up\" and everyone has their moments. And really, I might laugh too If I was them. But it's not all the time. My knee-jerk reaction is almost always \"they're laughing at you\".\n\nI feel like people are talking about me 'behind my back' as well. And again, I know this is probably not true, but even when I tell myself that, dude you arn't even on the radar bro. I still cant shake the feeling.\n\nI was out practicing my basketball shot today and there were a group of 'loud guys' gathered around a truck in the parking lot near by. They were laughing and talking loud and in general having a good time. They probably couldn't see me very well, but they could hear me playing, and every time they'd laugh I'd wonder about if it was something I did.\n\nIm a fair player and I had all these thoughts like \"You wouldn't laugh at me if you played me\" (so serious) but hahah it's very likely that they would with that attitude.  \nRegardless of what I told myself, It seemed like when they would talk real loud or laugh it would effect my shots for the worse.\n\nThese guys are probably really nice and considerate, and would probably be very fun to hang out with/ play ball with/ whatever if I could get over my nerves and insecurities. I mean, they could be total assholes, the kind of people to leave broken glass on the beach, or throw a bottle at you at a dark field party or something just to get a rise out of someone or start a fight. \n\nBut I think most people are friendly and cool and Its the minority of people who will actually pick on someone.\n\nBut I wonder, because these \"kind of guys\" (loud, social, unstifled, lots of friends) were the kind of guys that used to pick on me in highschool...\n\nIt might be some kind of conditioning from highschool where I did get picked on a lot. \nWhere people did indeed say kind of nasty thing about me etc. \n\nEven after highschool Ive had some experiences where I feel like people were picking on me, but maybe I was just interpreting their actions as hostile when it could have been something else.\n\nMy question is, is this something I should see a mental health professional about? Ive heard this kind of thing could be paranoia. \n\nIs it a conditioned response?\n\nOr is it just my insecurities flaring up?\n\nWhats the fix?",

            "selftext": "I'm going to preface this by saying that I am a 25 year old male living in the northwest. I share a showspace with 4 roommates and my dog. I've been experiencing low-levels of anxiety my entire life, with the effects of it gradually 'ramping up' to the point they are at now. The first debilitating panic attack I experienced was this time last year. I had to leave my work and felt uncomfortable even taking the bus home. Since then it's gotten more prevalent in my life and the panic attacks have been way more intense. \n\n\nI'm a heavy drinker, I smoke a fair amount of weed, and have dabbled with psychedelic use and pharmaceuticals. After my panic attack yesterday I am trying to stop drinking, and believe that I may have been experiencing/still experiencing DTs. This last weekend was my birthday and I spent thursday-sunday drinking heavily, smoking weed, and not taking care of myself. All of this activity hit me like a brick wall around 5pm yesterday. I spent most of the day nursing a hangover, and slept until 2 in the afternoon. I was watching TV around 5 when I started feeling the panic attack brewing inside me. My chest started feeling heavy, I was having difficulty swallowing, my vision was blurred, classic panic attack. My panic attacks come in waves and remind me somewhat of an acid flashback, except for the trips are bad, and more subtle than your regular acid hallucinations. I have an over-whelming feeling of discomfort, I can't seem to focus on my breath, and my vision is warbled. It's been ridiculously hot the last couple of days, and I figured I'd take a cold shower to alleviate my anxiety. This only made things worse as it put my body in a weird sort of shock, where I couldn't feel anything.\n\n\n I called my girlfriend, and she came over to my aid. After a couple hours of experiencing these symptoms in waves, I decided I had had enough and went to urgent care to get evaluated. The doctor prescribed me with about 15 or so 50mg pills of hydroxyzine. I've been eating them in halves, having consumed 100 mg every 4 hours or so since last night. I feel the effects of the drug as a light grogginess, enough to put me to sleep and deal with the fatigue of detox. The doctor set me up for psych evaluation and I'm going to get my head checked up next week. I've been putting off visiting the doctor for so long and I'm glad my girlfriend helped convince me to go through with it. I'm working on cutting alcohol out of my life completely, and am still weary about self-medicating with weed, and becoming dependent on the hydroxyzine. My advice to everyone out there is to seek the help you need, even if your wrong with your self-diagnosis, the comfort of having a doctor check me out, and the ability to sleep and go about things pseudo normally today have made this experience extremely worth it for me.",

When I was younger I used to go out boating all the time.  I always found paddling to be really relaxing. Lately I've been wanting to get back into it, but I've struggled to get passed my anxiety to leave the house on my own, rent a kayak, and go out on the lake.  \n\nWell today I did just that!  I had to work up to it slowly, starting with getting use to driving to the rental place, and then hanging out in the nearby park until I felt comfortable with the area, but once I got out on the water again it was all totally worth it!

            "selftext": "Hello all, \n\nI began doing some research on Reddit and was very interested to see how many people on here share a similar story about their first panic attack or depersonalization episode being triggered by smoking marijuana.\n\nI too had this experience when I was about 14 years old and had reoccurring panic attacks and depersonalization for years to follow. \n\nI have done relentless research and inner work in order to heal myself from my anxiety. I am medication free and live a low anxiety life. \n\nIn regards to the marijuana induced panic attack experience, I have a perspective and some information about this that I have not found anywhere on this subreddit and feel the need to share. \n\nFor years I thought I triggered some mental illness by smoking pot. It seemed that during my first major panic attack (which was induced by marijuana) I was in a dream-like state, felt like I was going to die, and began to lose touch with reality (called depersonalization). For years after this event, I could almost will myself into a panic attack/depersonalization simply by reliving that original experience within my imagination. \n\nIt wasn't until recently - some 14 years later - that I was having a conversation with a psychologist friend of mine, explaining this story to her. She asked me a few questions about my experience and calmly suggested to me, \"you had/have PTSD\". I was surprised to hear that since I had never heard the suggestion before, but continued to look into it. \n\nI quickly realized, she had a strong argument. For anyone unaware, PTSD is defined as *\"an anxiety disorder that can develop after experiencing or witnessing a traumatic event, or learning that a traumatic event has happened to a loved one. DSM5 defines a traumatic event as exposure to actual or threatened death, serious injury, or sexual violence.\"*\n\nIn short, the first panic attack or depersonalization experience feels like a near death experience. It is intensely traumatic and mimics threatened death. \n\nI also found a statement (sorry I can't find the source) listing that over 50% of people who experience depersonalization suffer from ptsd.\n\nSo, in conclusion, I wish for anyone interested to do some simple google searches with terms \"PTSD + ANXIETY\" and \"PTSD + DEPERSONALIZATION\" (or dissociation) \n\nThere is much to this, so I won't write too much here. If anyone has questions about my own experience, please feel free to DM me. \n\nHope this helps!\n",

And I'm just sick and tired of it at this point. I feel so discouraged by the fact that I haven't been able to overcome any (or all) of my anxiety disorders yet, and so exhausted by the daily battles against my anxiety that I have to wage. I just want to give up and wave my proverbial white flag. I give in. I'm done. No mas. If only it were actually possible to give up in this fight. But, unfortunately, the only real way to give up against anxiety is to kill yourself, and I've promised my parents multiple times that I wouldn't ever do that, so I'm just stuck. Stuck and exhausted and frustrated and angry.\n\nThanks for letting me vent. Don't worry about responding to this. I know I'm just being whiny right now.",

It was pretty amazing so I decided to have my boyfriend try it. We did it together and really enjoyed ourselves and had the best time together in a long time. Then, on the 10th of June we did it again. I know this is a terrible choice  seeing as you're only supposed to do Molly once every couple months. I Did not know this so we took the dose as normal. \nWell, he seemed to have a pretty good experience rolling but mine never really started. \nSince I know this is not /r/drugs (which I have written to them about this too) I will not go into much more detail about the Molly. \nIt may be important to add that I am also a drinker and have been for the past 4 years. I never used to get this Feeling when I woke up after a night of drinking. But ever since I did the Molly I have been waking up with the worst anxiety I ever have had. About my relationship. \nThis scares me quite a lot since I have been with this man for 5 years now. I am hoping this all blows over, since I do not want to be having such anxiety over the man I love. \nI am wondering if I should just cut drinking out of my life for good now that it feels like I might have some trouble with this Feeling. I wake up with no spit in my mouth and feeling like a house was dropped on me. I just want to feel normal again and I am scared that this is what it is now. \n\nSorry if I posted this to the wrong subreddit, wasn't sure where else and just trying to get some answers. \n\nThank you all.

I been on celexa, prozac, buspar and ativan. I have not been on meds in over a year and now I am having severe anxiety on a daily basis again, hence making a dr visit. I am 32 yrs old, i been at my job now for 10years and i feel done with it. I am not happy, i dont feel fulfilled with work, i feel like just another needle in a haystack for a big company. I have my goals and aspirations but majority of the close people in my life laugh and doubt me. I cant go to restaurants, amusement parks, movies, big family events or gatherings. I stick to my safe zones and secluded places knowing i wont have attacks or if i do ill be able to leave the situation. I know the dr today will put me back on meds, is that ok? What should i do? I just feel so overwhelmed with my mind and my body like i have a bad seed in me thats ruining my life. Thanks for letting me vent, its never easy telling my situation.",

I think so. \n\nAnyway, I just started on Lexapro, and I'm hoping for the best! I finally made an appointment with my doctor to speak with her about my anxiety and how it's basically ruining my life. Nervous all the time, elevated heart rate, random sweating, sleepless, irritated, several panic attacks a day type deal. My doctor was receptive to my request for an aid in handling my anxiety so she prescribed me Lexapro. This is my first time using it, but not my first run-in with antidepressants; I tried Zoloft when I was 16 (22 now) and experienced only adverse side effects, but I have a tremendous amount of hope. The only weird thing I've noticed is that I was pretty shaky when I woke up this morning and went downstairs, but I could attribute that to hunger, my upset stomach, or that I jogged 4 miles last night and haven't done that in a long time. \n\nAny words of wisdom or success stories concerning Lexapro? I'd like to avoid any negative experiences so I don't develop a bias\u2014I'm misanthropic enough to do that to myself without any help. :) How are y'all doing today?\n\nP.S.

            "selftext": "I hope I can make it through this.\n\nAlright, so I've been living with my disorders for a while now, and I'd been doing decently with coping, I had my two best friends to help me out, but I recently graduated college and now I'm without their support. Now I'm alone with my own mind and things are getting worse as far as convincing myself to go and try to do things outside my room. I want so badly to go and try to make friends with new people, but then my anxiety kicks in and I start to freak out over meeting with new people and trying to talk to them, so then I just avoid that chance at all and then my depression tags in and kicks me when I'm down.\n\nExample, I want to go find a place to play MTG somewhere, but then my anxiety kicks in and things like 'what if you're the oldest person there?' or 'what if no one wants to talk to you' or 'what if everyone thinks you're weird' or 'what if people won't like you' and the big one that haunts me for everything 'what if people are just being tolerant of you and they don't want anything to do with you?' Now apply those 'what if' statements with everything else in my life, and that's roughly what I deal with on a daily basis. With each missed oppertunity my depression creeps in and pretty much knocks me down to the point of making myself feel worthless, and that I don't want to crawl out of bed in the mornings because I'm such a F*** up.\n\nI honestly don't know how to make friends any more, I only had my two friends because of classes, but now that I'm out of college I don't even know where to go find others who would be interested in the same things as I do. It seems like all my hobbies are solitary things anyhow, video games, writing, and reading. How would I even meet new people? What Would I say? Would I annoy them? For that matter, I can't even make friends online, I don't feel right just messaging a person because we may be in the same FB community, it just seems weird.\n\nI'm a very shy person, so that doesn't help anything either. I've never been good at talking to strangers, basically because I think that I'd be a bother to them or they won't be interested in talking to me. I'm writing this here because I hope that someone out there knows what I'm going through and can help me better myself. I'm tired of living like this, and I want to better myself, I just don't know how and I just can't take living in isolation anymore.\n\nSorry for the length of this, I kinda just let my mind run.\n\nUPDATE 6/12/16\nThank you everyone for giving me your encouragement, it means a lot to me. As far as medication goes I was on a variety of different ones for 3 years just trying to see what would help me, but nothing did the trick and the therapist at the time suggested I get off of them to see how I would fee. I think I hit my one jackpot in life because I felt the same off as I did on meds. I'm trying to find a therapist, but with no job it kinda makes things hard. I just want to say thank you all so much for being so cool, the world needs more cool people like you all :D",
