            "selftext": "Here is a list of \u201cCommon Cognitive Distortions\u201d from the 2012 book *Treatment and Interventions for Depression and Anxiety Disorders* by Robert L. Leahy, Stephen J.F. Holland, and Lata McGinn.\n\nMy therapist gave me a copy of this list, and told me to familiarize myself with all 12 cognitive distortions. I\u2019m supposed to label them whenever I catch myself doing one in real life (ex: I just used emotional reasoning). He says that putting a label to it will help you to distinguish between what is a cognitive distortion (read: your anxiety) and what is rational/legitimate. It keeps you from letting your anxiety take over your thinking. \n\nI was surprised about how many of these I do! I do pretty much all of them. I do \u201cblaming\u201d the least, but I catch myself doing using these cognitive distortions countless times every day. \n\nWhich ones do you do? Try to hold yourself accountable! Put a name to your anxiety, so that you can help control it! :)\nHere\u2019s the list:\n\n1.\t**Mind Reading**. You assume that you know what people think without sufficient evidence of their thoughts. \u201cHe thinks I\u2019m a loser.\u201d\n2.\t**Fortune-telling**. You predict the future negatively: things will get worse, or there is danger ahead. \u201cI\u2019ll fail that exam\u201d or \u201cI won\u2019t get the job.\u201d\n3.\t**Catastrophizing**. You believe that what has happened or will happen will be so awful and unbearable that you won\u2019t be able to stand it. \u201cIt would be terrible if I failed.\u201d\n4.\t**Labeling**. You assign global negative traits to yourself and others. \u201cI\u2019m undesirable,\u201d or \u201cHe\u2019s a rotten person.\u201d\n5.\t**Discounting positives**. You claim that the positive things you or others do are trivial. \u201cThat\u2019s what wives are supposed to do- so it doesn\u2019t count when she\u2019s nice to me,\u201d or \u201cThose successes were easy, so they don\u2019t matter.\u201d\n6.\t**Negative filtering**. You focus almost exclusively on the negatives and seldom notice the positives. \u201cLook at all of the people who don\u2019t like me.\u201d\n7.\t**Overgeneralizing**. You perceive a global pattern of negatives on the basis of a single incident. \u201cThis generally happens a lot to me. I seem to fail at a lot of things.\u201d\n8.\t**Dichotomous thinking**. You view events or people in all-or-nothing terms. \u201cI get rejected by everyone,\u201d or \u201cIt was a complete waste of time.\u201d\n9.\t**Blaming**. You focus on the other person as the source of your negative feelings, and you refuse to take responsibility for changing yourself. \u201cShe\u2019s to blame for the way I feel now,\u201d or \u201cMy parents caused all of my problems.\u201d\n10.\t**What if?** You keep asking a series of questions about \u201cwhat if\u201d something happens, and you fail to be satisfied with any of the answers. \u201cYeah, but what if I get anxious?,\u201d or \u201cWhat if I can\u2019t catch my breath?\u201d\n11.\t**Emotional Reasoning**. You let your feelings guide your interpretation of reality. \u201cI feel depressed; therefore, my marriage is not working out.\u201d\n12.\t**Inability to disconfirm**. You reject any evidence that might contradict your negative thoughts. For example, when you have the thought *I\u2019m unlovable*, you reject as irrelevant any evidence that people like you. Consequently, your thoughts cannot be refuted. \u201cThat\u2019s not the real issue. There are deeper problems. There are other factors.\u201d\n\n\nEDIT: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_restructuring\n\nHere's a useful wikipedia article on how to deal with conquering these distortions, thanks to /u/1210MK2!",

            "selftext": "Late last night I was doing my typical 2-3 AM reddit browsing/gaming, when I came upon an interesting post in one of my subscribed subreddits (I'm kinda scared to name it/be detailed about it). The post was a about a laptop that I happened to be curious about, being a computer guy. The OP had posted a link to an image gallery of their newly-acquired laptop, and I looked through it in awe.\n\nGoing further, one of the images had the laptop placed upside down on top of a desk, with two batteries on top of the laptop. Both of the batteries were the same brand as the laptop, so I assumed they were both designed for simultaneous use in the laptop, since I actually own a similar laptop with 2 batteries, with the same manufacturer but a different model.\n\nSo then I posted a comment on the reddit post, complimenting with how impressive the laptop was, and I then proceeded to post the voltage, current, and wattage details about the two batteries as the initial image was upside down, thinking it would help save peoples' time.\n\nFast forward about 12 hours, I get back on my computer and go straight to reddit, and see that I have unread messages in my inbox. Now, most of the inbox replies I've received have been stuff like \"Thank you\" for helping others or just general, non-hostile comments. So I felt reasonably confident whenever I went to read my inbox.\n\nUnfortunately the negative had hit me. Two replies was about how one of the batteries was actually for a different laptop model, and that's when I felt the negative \"I'm such a fucking idiot\" thoughts struck me. I can't remember what the contents of the third reply were as I was desperate to get away from them, and delete my comment that I had posted there. Then I started blankly staring at my computer monitor and could feel my hands shaking a little, and started heavily breathing.\n\nIt depresses me. I'll probably start getting scared again when I get inbox replies. I was doing so well up until now. :(\n\nEdit: really didn't expect his post to blow up the way it did. I feel heaps better now, thanks for the support!",

I've tried for a long time to tackle it on my own. Too many years of hearing, \"it's all in your head. Just don't think about it. Don't feel anxious.\" And in all my struggles, it just seems to be getting progressively worse. So I will be going to the doctor tomorrow afternoon to discuss with him this matter. I also have ADD which I am kind of finding out has a sort of link to anxiety disorders in itself, but I guess what I'm getting at here is, is there anything specific that I need to mention to the doctor tomorrow? I'm not sure really what to say to him or how to explain what goes on in my head. I just can't deal with it alone anymore. It's beginning to control every aspect of my life. So, any advice would be greatly appreciated in what the doctor may need to know =). Thank you all so much for even taking the time to read this if you did. ",

I found out that I'm actually hypoglycemic.  It has been causing my panic attacks for quite some time.  I had no idea.  Something as simple as eating better and getting some sugar in me actually helps considerably.  But doctors never bothered to check.  Sugar has been as low a 25.   Granted, over time, the anxiety starts to develop on its own, but for me, there was a direct cause-&gt;effect relationship.  It just astounds me how that was missed by nearly every doctor.",
