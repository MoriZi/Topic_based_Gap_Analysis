Well I said the same thing I have told her like hundreds of times \"I will lose my mind any second, I will go crazy and lose sense of reality.\" Her next response has kept me going still, \"You are afraid of something that you have no control of. You're afraid you're going crazy? Then go crazy, now. See? You can't do anything about it so why worry about it. It's 'only anxiety' and you know it. It will feel bad, really bad, but it will not kill you, it will not make you lose control. Don't try to fight it, you're only making it worse. Let anxiety come to you and don't be afraid of it. The moment you stop being afraid, the moment you will be free.\n\nEnglish is not my first language so I'm sorry if you can't make sense of my comment, my point is that just learn to face your fears, cliche I know, but it really helped me and I hope it can help some one else.",

I love you when you get caught up in your thoughts, when you are stressed, when your stomach hurts, when you feel whole, when you feel empty, when you feel grief, when you feel shame. I love you when you're anxious, when you have panic attacks, and when you're super relaxed. I love you when you can't concentrate and also when you get in the zone. I love you when you're being mean to yourself and when you practice self compassion. I love you when all you can handle is watching TV all day. I love you when you're sad and when you're happy and when you're excited and when you're exhausted and when you're scared and when you're brave. I love that you are sensitive and feel things deeply.

For awhile I was happy about the decision, despite the constant struggle.\n\nThe past 5 years have been especially tough and it's been a downward spiral. Every time I told myself I'd call the doctor, I'd chicken out and push the thought in the back of my mind.\n\nThen this weekend happened. My oldest daughter is away from me for the first time since she was born. I'm terribly sad and anxious about this and the house has been insanely quiet.\n\nWhen we got home from dropping her off, the neighbor stopped by and informed us that his dog chased our cat up a tree, and the cat fell and died. I loved this cat more than I knew possible. He and I were best buddies. He was great with my kids. He was fearless, an adventurer. He likes to go for walks with me to pick up the mail, and sounded like a tiger when he walked. I'm so devastated and have barely stopped crying since we found out on Sunday.\n\nThe worst part is that my daughter doesn't know yet. We don't want to ruin her trip.\n\nThat said, this was the last straw. The cat dying gave me awful depressive thoughts and anxiety beyond control. \n\nI must have picked up the phone 10 times yesterday but finally I did it. I went in, cried at the doctor, and got a prescription for zoloft. After 12 years trying to deal with this shit on my own, I'm ready to deal with some of the side affects if it means that I can quiet down my never-ending anxiety and depression.",

There is no gradual change from my normal self to worse, it seems to be normal, then a gigantic panic attack, however it takes a lot to get me to the point.

I write down what I'm thankful for in my journal and when and where my panic attack started. Lotion to focus on my hands and gum. Xanax is my last resort, of course. \n\nDo you guys have something like this too? Share your kits, post pictures! I'll post a picture of mine later.

One of the best things I ever did for my social anxiety was to get a job as a cashier at Panera bread. It gave me the opportunity to talk with people all the time. Just forced myself to talk about the weather or what was currently going on in the moment. I became better as time went on. By forcing yourself into this position it will help you become more social. It was so freaking hard the first six months. The amount of anxiety I felt was so over whelming. But eventually when you do something so many times you get bored. That is the trick. Do it enough times so you get bored instead of anxious. Hope this tip helps someone. Good luck and stay strong! Love this Reddit! :)",

Anyway, when it comes on it's usually random and I am not worried about anything, it's just there.  I am not in fight or flight mode at all, just very anxious.  I hate it because IT IS JUST A NUISANCE, I don't care about it, I am not worried about ANYTHING, nothing is wrong or off about where I am or what I am doing.  So, does anyone else feel this way? The racing heart, the fluttering of the stomach, and the restlessness, but a completely calm and collected mind other than the obnoxious physical symptoms increasing distraction?  Haven't found anyone to relate to because I always hear about the worries, fight or flight responses, or adrenaline involved that don't really impact me at all.",

But now, suddenly, they're gone and I still have anxiety but its... different. I dont know how to explain it. I feel like I dont know who I am. I feel like I'm on a different plane of existence than everyone else. I don't feel human. I also can't seem to think rationally anymore. My common sense is gone, I cant remember anything, I can't focus on anything (I had trouble focusing before too but now its basically completely gone). I'm having trouble telling right from wrong as well. I just feel so inhuman. And I cant stop hating myself. I feel so disgusted by myself and my existence. I've never felt this much hatred and disgust before. I saw a video of myself the other day (it was taken the same day) and I looked so ALIVE in the video. I was moving around and eating and reacting to my environment, like everyone else, but in reality I dont feel real or alive at all. I feel dead. I dont feel my environment. Everything is so dimmed and dull, nothing feels real. I think I'm really losing my mind this time. I'm so scared I don't know what to do, I dont wanna become insane. ",

            "selftext": "I had my first counselor appointment 2-3 weeks ago. I had set up an appointment (today) with a psychiatrist, followed immediately by my second appointment with my counselor. She had told me at the first appointment, that I should tell my psychiatrist I'm not interested in medications. However, the psychiatrist convinced me to try Wellbutrin, although I'm still a little on the fence. \n\n\n\n\nWhen I went to my counselor appointment right after, I told her about the Wellbutrin, and then at the end of the hour, she opened her calendar, and flipped to August, and said something along the lines of, \"so I think you should call around early August to schedule an appointment. If you end up deciding to go off Wellbutrin you can call to come in earlier, or if you feel like you need to come in earlier, you can as well.\"\n\n\n\n\nI'm really confused, I had been told generally people have meetings every 2-3 weeks, and that the psychiatrist prefers people to keep seeing the counselors even with meds. I feel like I decided to try meds and she pushed me 3-4 months away. I know meds won't keep my family from being a huge stressor in my life, along with school. \n\n\n\n\nIs this common? Is seeing a psychiatrist AND a counselor something that's just not common?  With my personality, I tend not to open up to people I don't know, so if I only see her 4 times a year, I'm going to get nothing out of this. Very frustrated.\n\n\n\nEdit: Thanks all for taking the time to write out advice or give me support! :)",
