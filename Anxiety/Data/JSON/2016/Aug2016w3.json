            "selftext": "My old post from yesterday: https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/4y96lt/im_21_years_old_and_tomorrow_i_am_going_to_face/\n\nIf you are struggling like I am please read this (or at least skim) because I have some super-valuable-might-solve-your-problems tips for you. This is going to be long but I am just going to spill my guts on what Ive been doing for the past month before my test.\n\nWhat a day. At times my heart was pounding, almost all day my palms were sweating. Sometimes I thought I was going to be sick. But I was there. And I did it. I took the test.\n\nNo, I didnt pass. I was so nervous that I made mistakes that I dont normally make, mostly dealing with observation. It wasnt awful. I drove quite well through most of it. I just happened to make 2 mistakes that were bad enough to make me fail by 4 points.\n\nBut I dont like using the word \"fail\", because I didnt. I did something that at one point I truly thought I would never do in my life. In that, **I succeeded**. And I am fully ready to dust myself off and try again. Now, some words of advise for people who are in the same position as I was.\n\nJust GETTING to this point was an incredible challenge, and I had to do some very specific, and actually non-cliche things to get to where I am, mentally. I recommend doing all these things while your anxiety is being treated by a professional, whether that is just your GP or a CBT.\n\nFirst of all, **stop looking at this as a success or failure thing, as though its really that simple for us**. Imagining yourself with only those 2 options puts too much pressure on you. Dont ever look at it like youve only got one shot in your life to take your drivers test, or that youve only ever got one shot in your life to be successful. Thats not true. You need to look at it as you simply doing a task that you need to do, like running an errand. Either you complete it today or you complete it another day. You dont fail/lose if you dont complete it today. Just take the action of doing it. If you dont get what you need to get done done then you can always go back and do it again, just like forgetting eggs at the store and having to make a second trip.\n\nNext, I have a question. **Have you ever pictured yourself driving before, or does your mind always imagine you in the passenger seat by default?** Dont look at it as though you *belong* in the passenger seat, like its just some natural thing to you. Listen to me, you *can* drive. You have that ability. I mean that. Picturing yourself doing this is the most important step you will ever do in this process. You need to just close your eyes and picture yourself driving normally. No drama. Stop picturing some deadly crash, or embarrassing blunder. Which brings me to my next point.\n\n**Write about it.** Cant picture yourself driving normally without bad things happening? Ok, heres what I did. On your computer, make a secret place to write. Nobody will ever know about it. Its your private space to vent. Write about driving. Write anything you want, but you need to find a way to put a positive spin on it. You need to end your writing with *something* about you achieving your goal. You can write a little story about you taking and passing the test. I wasnt able to do that, so I just settled with typing out the pros and cons of getting my licence, ending my little diary entry on the pros. I just really let my thoughts flow. I wrote everything I was thinking. It felt so good to let out these thoughts that, honestly, I was running away from and trying to ignore a lot (for the sake of not getting anxiety)...but, bottling things up creates anxiety of its own. You need to express your thoughts somehow. When your done writing about driving, read what you wrote back to yourself while doing calm breaths. Then just spend some time thinking about it. If you know how to lucid dream, I highly reccommend trying to dream about driving. That is part of how your brain processes things, and I think the trouble with anxiety is that sometimes avoiding an anxiety attack about something means you dont let yourself think about it, so you dont let your brain process stuff. Dreaming is literally designed for your brain to process different situations so this is a great technique.\n\n**Anxiety will always try to fool you**. Listen, I know that car accidents happen, but your anxiety is making you think they happen way more often and to way more people than they really do. It blows up your perception of the likelyhood of something happening to you to extreme proportions. Stop looking at it as though something WILL happen. I IS good enough to say \"it probably wont\". You act as though saying \"it probably wont happen to me\" is you fooling yourself into thinking your safer than you are, but thats not true. Instead, you are fooling yourself into thinking you are in more danger than you are. *Live your life*. Dont be imprisoned by anxiety. Break anxieties illusion.\n\n Anxiety is tricky, because it puts us inside of an illusion. **You need to learn how to recognize when you are seeing the world through anxieties illusion, or through what it really is.** What a wonderful thing that we live in the age of the internet. Do not always assume the worst. I can assume that I will win the lottery tomorrow. That doesnt make it true. Instead of assuming, wouldnt it be smarter to look up the statistics of me winning and come to a conclusion based on that? I can do that with google. Information is so freely avaliable to us today. Allow yourself to think critically instead of emotionally when assessing risks. \n\n* There were 29,989 fatal motor vehicle crashes in the United States in 2014. The American popuation in 2014 was roughly 318,900,000. What a small number of people compared to the entire population! **Now think**. How many of those people were drinking? How many of those people were high? How many of those people were texting? How many of them were being dumb with their friends driving recklessly for fun? Guys....you have anxiety. Are you really going to do those things? We are so damn cautious. When you cut out all the people who were under the influence and being stupid for funzies, what is left? How many people got cut out of the number 29,989, out of 318,900,000?\n\n**JUST DO IT.** This is for people who already know how to drive but are terrified of taking the test. Go to the DMV with someone you are close to and schedule your appointment even if you are completely not emotionally ready. Now, this wont work for everyone, but for people with anxiety who are big on deadlines this might be the push you need. Make sure you give yourself time to process your fear. Dont just say \"yeah, Ill take it next week\" if thats a completely unrealistic time for you to process things. For me, I scheduled mine a little over a month ahead. And, yeah, I wasnt sure if Id be able to process it in that time either but what matters is you are giving yourself a lengthy amount of time, but not so lengthy you think you might back out of it. Sometimes its good to put pressure on yourself. And you know what? If you back out you back out. But, you want to do this right? Just chance it and schedule the test....just to see what happens. Make sure you do all the steps I have talked about before if you do this.\n\n**The day before and of your test, put as many other stressors behind you as you can. Dont you dare think about anything but happy/calm things and your test**. If you can put anything off for a day or two, you need to do that. (**This includes any thoughts of the future or \"what if?\"s.**) Just do it until you take your test, then you can worry about other tasks and stressors when you are done. The trouble with anxiety is that we tend to focus on all our stressors at the same time and it overwhelms us. Well, just like some of us are able to avoid thinking about driving, you can do the same thing about any other stressor. Shift gears and ignore all stressors except for driving for a day. Again, Id like to emphasize that this does not mean do nothing but think about driving all day long. It just means that driving takes up enough stress in itself for you so you need to make room for it *should that stress come about*, instead of overwhelming yourself with everything at once.\n\n**THE DAY OF, think about the fact that you have anxiety and are scared out of your freaking mind as little as possible** or else you will start making excuses for yourself and also psyche yourself out. Positive or neural thoughts only. If you arent sure you are going to pass, dont lie to yourself and say \"oh yeah, Ive totally got this\", because that puts pressure on you. But also dont think \"Oh god I am going to fail\". Instead go for a neutral thought that is *true* like \"You know what? I am just going to do this.\". Everytime feel a negative thought coming on switch to \"You know what? Im going to do this.\". \n\nFinally, **you may or may not have people you want to get the licence for, but at the end of the day nothing pushes you better than the desire to do this for YOU.** Honestly, that was the final push. And, you know what? I didnt decide I wanted to do this for me until THE DAY BEFORE THE TEST. But now I am more determined than ever. I feel like before I *thought* I wanted to get my licence for me, but, really, a piece of me was still secretly copping out and feeling ok with going the rest of my life without driving. How can I respect myself and think that? What a disservice I would be doing for myself. DO THIS because its good for you. DO this so you can remove limitations that not having a licence puts on you. Do this because you love yourself and you want to help yourself. \n\nPlease let me know if you have any questions or thoughts. Id love to hear what you have to say and help whoever I can.",

            "selftext": "Almost a year ago I started finishing every shower with 30 seconds to 1 minute of cold water. I did this as a part of a 30-day challenge with my brother and a mutual internet friend we met on Twitter. The 30-day challenge was spurred by [this episode of the Tim Ferriss Show with Wim Hof](http://fourhourworkweek.com/2015/09/07/the-iceman-wim-hof/).\r\n\r\nWe all completed the 30-day challenge with relative success, only skipping the cold shower a few times each throughout the challenge. What we found most interesting about the cold showers is that we all felt they enabled us to do everyday things that we typically would avoid or delay because of anxiety.\r\n\r\nFor example when we did the cold shower in the morning, we found it was easier to make a phone call that we were dreading or say Hi to an acquaintance in public. Our explanation for this was that cold showers are an anxiety inducing situation, but a safe one that you can do on your own with no one watching. When you do it, it puts a win under your belt early in the day which you can build on. It also just makes your body feel really good, so you get an immediate reward for doing it.\r\n\r\nSince that challenge, I have kept the cold shower practice going and continue to experience these results. A cold shower isn't going to eliminate your anxiety, but I believe it is one small thing you can do every day that helps.\r\n\r\nOh and I'm not under the impression that we discovered anything new here. Polar bear clubs have been doing this for years. Our cold shower challenge was the same exact concept: challenge ourselves to experience cold water and do it in a social context so we can hold each other accountable. It's just a little easier to incorporate into your daily routine.\r\n\r\nOne thing that might limit your results is if you live in a relatively hot climate. Cold water just isn't as cold in Texas as it is in Michigan. It's all relative though, so it still might do the trick for you.",

            "selftext": "On July 2nd I left my long time SO. The main factor, or rather the straw that broke the camel's back was the fact he didn't understand my anxiety and would worsen it with thinhs like his idea that holding me down during panic attacks was brilliant. I told him time and time again that it would only make things worse. But he refused to listen. He had been doing this for about 6 months, but it got to a point where he was causing them out of nowhere. \n\nI started medication 3 months ago and hadn't had an attack, aside from when being held down, in weeks. But that night he insisted I be held down. I immediately went into full panic, and tried pulling myself out of it. But he wouldn't let go, and he kept yelling and pulling harder. I was struggling as he progressed things, which only made me pull harder. He slammed my head into the ground and held me down until my arms were covered in bruises. [My eyes were black](http://imgur.com/ITI5zVO.jpg) and [my forehead had a huge goose-egg to go with my bruised arm](http://imgur.com/o4njqqP.jpg)\n\nHe spent years convincing me I was broken. That he was helping me by doing the things he did. He convinced me that my anxiety made me crazy. That he didn't have to answer to me about anything. If he disappeared for 4 hours longer than he said I was insane for checking up on him. I was so convinced I was in the wrong. That he really did have my interests in mind, and I was too far for help. \n\nSince leaving him I've never felt better. I realized just how much anxiety he caused, and that anxiety doesn't mean I'm crazy. It means I care more, I'm more cautious, that I think before I act. It means I will listen to you, and validate your feelings. \n\nAlthough I'm anxious about all of the court things, and feeling like he's going to come for me, or that my career will be ruined before it even begins, I'm able to recognize that they may not happen instead of being bombarded and told I'm insane. I have someone who listens to my thoughts and talks me through them instead of calling me stupid. It's so freeing to be anxious, because I don't feel like I have to hide it until I explode.\n\nEdit: Thank you all for the kind words of support. It's been a rough time, but I feel so much happier in general. I reconnected with a guy friend of mine, M,  and we've begun a semi-relationship. He's much more understanding, and tries to help me cope with my anxiety instead of ignore it. He finds my neurotic habits endearing, and he's been around to listen to my stresses with this situation.\n\n I showed up at court today only to find my request for a deferred prosecution was granted. With this he will be unable to contact me or get in any legal trouble for a year. If he gets so much as a speeding ticket he will be back to court for this. Essentially I just wanted to let this die for now. I have my junior year of college coming up, not to mention many other stressors and truthfully I just want to move on with my life. I'm ready to progress my relationship with M, to make new friends, and to live my life for myself. \n\nI will likely be posting more, as I'd like to speak to others about my anxiety when I have a much better hold on it. Lately I've been able to see the build up and slow it down as opposed to being pushed into an attack. So I will likely chronicle it. :) \n\nThanks again all!",

            "selftext": "I traveled to an international academic conference by myself. I'm pretty well-traveled, but being all alone in a professional social setting and leaving the comfort and safety of my home resulted in a panic attack on the 11-hour flight over. I worked through it, forced myself to sleep instead of throwing up, and survived. Yesterday I mustered all the courage I had and started a conversation with another girl at the conference who appeared to be all alone. That one girl turned into four other nervous solo travelers from all over, and now we've attended conference talks and dinners together as new friends. Sure, we'll only see each other literally once a year at the conference, but that makes a world of difference. \n\nHere's to surviving. \n\nEdit: Thanks, guys! :)",

            "selftext": "I haven't drunk coffee for a year. Until today.\n\nI really loved coffee, the flavor, the taste, but it was giving me instant panic attacks more often then not, so I decided to give it up. \nI've been working on myself really hard for the past ~6 months though and have been feeling particulary rebellious against my anxiety lately.\nSo today I decided to give my beloved coffee a go and see what happens. And basically... nothing happened. So a few hours later a followed the coffee with a strong black tea (I've cut out all sources of caffeine for that year). \nI started to feel maybe a little jittery, but decided to push myself further and went out for a walk and grocery shopping.\n\nYou see, I tend to get anxious everywhere besides my home just by being there. Shops and the subway are by far the worst. I'm hypochondriac and always afraid that I will faint/get nauseous/get a heart attack and I'm often paralized by the fear that other people will see it.\n\nThat's why going for a walk and some grocery shopping was a push for me.\nAnd yeah, those thoughts \"You will get sick\", \"You'll faint\" popped out, but I thought back \"Kay, bring it\" and they basically disappeard.\n\nI am feeling super fine now.\n\nI'm not posting this to say that it's a great idea to down as much caffeine as you can, or any at all if you're struggling with anxiety.\n\nI guess I'm just posting this here, because it's such a huge victory for me, conquering so many things at once.\n\nI realised that at this point it's not coffee/city/shops that are giving me anxiety. It's anxiety that's giving me anxiety and it makes me feel much more free if it makes any sense to you.\n\nSo, anyways. It gets better. If you put the work in something, you'll get the results. That's my message. :)",

            "selftext": "I've had anxiety for as long as I can remember but never experienced a truly crippling panic attack until yesterday. I have an interview for my dream job on Tuesday and while interviews always make me anxious, I've been feeling pretty confident this time around. \n\nYesterday I spent some time preparing answers to potential interview questions and after an hour or two of productive work I decided to take a break. I was feeling excited and hopeful, confident that I had done more than enough to prepare. No more than 5 minutes later my chest tightened up, my heart started racing and I felt chills all over my body. Initially my mind was free of anxious thoughts, however, physically I felt as though I was no longer in control of my body. The feeling of no control eventually lead my mind into its own state of panic. \n\nI took a Klonopin and went to lie down to try some breathing exercises and relax. Usually when I'm feeling anxious, lying in bed is the only thing that makes me feel \"safe\" and relaxed. Unfortunately, it backfired this time. Lying motionless made my rapid heart rate much more noticeable and only added to my panic. \n\nAt the height of my attack I recalled someone mentioning that coloring was the only thing to bring them peace. Lacking any supplies, I thought about walking to CVS to buy an \"adult\" coloring book and pack of colored pencils. I don't know how I managed to get myself out of the house, but once I stepped outside into the fresh air and sunshine, I began feeling a small sense of relief. I don't know if it came from the fresh air or the fact that I somehow regained control of my body, but the ounce of relief I felt was undeniable. \n\nAs I made my way to CVS, my mindset slowly began changing from its state of overwhelming panic to a state of comfort. I didn't feel quite like I could see the light at the end of the tunnel, but I knew it was there and slowly approaching. Recognizing the difference helped ease my mind and slow my rapid heartbeat. \n\nI walked into CVS and made my way to the school supply section. The shelves were completely ransacked and mostly empty and my panic began creeping back as I realized Back to School is upon us. I scoured through the disarray of what was left and managed to find the LAST coloring book (lucky for me it came with a pack of colored pencils).\n\nI went straight to checkout and headed home, protecting my coloring book as if it was a winning lottery ticket. When I got home I plugged in my noise-cancelling headphones and turned on some therapy music and got right to work on a heart-shaped bouquet of [flowers](https://i.imgur.com/6yxCTq2.jpg). \n\nFilling in the last flower made me feel as though I had left all of my anxious thoughts and feelings on the paper and replaced them with a colorful bouquet of happiness. \n\nAt first I was skeptical that coloring of all things would help, but it did! It was incredibly helpful in changing my focus from my anxious thoughts to careful concentration of coloring. I would absolutely recommend it to anyone who needs to distract themselves from their anxious thoughts. Even writing this post a day later has been therapeutic and has made me realize that things do get better. I will definitely be keeping a coloring book and pencils handy in case of another emergency!\n\nUpdate: Thank you everyone for all of your support! Just had the interview and I think it went well! The questions were surprisingly difficult but I think I answered them to the best of my knowledge and handled it with grace. At the end, before I could ask about \"next steps\" the interviewer said they would let the team know about our call and she would contact me later this week with next steps. I'm hoping this is a good sign, but I will keep you posted! Thanks again for your support, /r/anxiety! &lt;3",

I know how to drive, but the test terrified me. I was afraid I'd have a panic attack and have to pull over and fail. Or that I'd just be so nervous that I'd make dumb mistakes that would screw me over (I did sort of do that in the beginning. I guess it's to be expected) but I PASSED!

I've finally been able to face my anxiety, put a real face on it and finally been able to fight back against it.\n\nI made the major change of forgiving myself for the mistakes I've made. Maybe I didn't do the best in school or university. Maybe I don't have a job right now because my anxiety kept me from working. But it just doesn't matter anymore to me. All that stress? all that extra baggage that was weighing me down? It's gone. I've finally achieved my nirvana. I have to take medication or the negativity will sit in my head. But the medication works. It actually works and now everything in my life is finally coming together.\n\nI stood up to my sister and mom and was finally able to establish the boundaries in our relationships that I've needed to do my whole life.\n\nI've rebuilt my relationship with my father.\n\nI had a friend over for the first time in a long time. He's so positive now, he's reached his Nirvana as well and we just fed off it. We were laughing and smiling and having a wonderful time. I think I could end up getting the best friend I always wish I could have had when I was a kid.\n\nThe girl I love is taking baby steps back into my life. Now that the negativity is gone there's a light.\n\nI went from.. underachieving. Always feeling like I wasn't good enough for anything. Hating the world, hating everything.\n\nNow I have this light that just propels my forward. Positive people are coming back into my life in droves.\n\nIt's funny. I used to look at motivation speeches and think it was garbage. Those super passionate teachers I had that always said \"you'll love me when you're older, but you'll hate me now\" they were fucking right.\n\nI've got what I need now. I grew my spine back. I feel like I finally realize that all the limits in my life were limits I just put on myself.\n\nEveryone of you can do it too. You just need to have faith.\n\nRemember. You're all worthwhile, no matter what anyone else tells you, no matter what your inner monologue tries to tell you. You're worth it.\n\nI reached my Nirvana and I will fight tooth and nail to protect it.\n\nI'm free.",

            "selftext": "I thought I would post about my experience with neurofeedback in treating depression and anxiety.\nA little background, I've always had underlying depression and anxiety, but didn't start dealing with it until about 4 years ago when I kept having issues getting to work and having panic attacks. My social life suffered too, pushed away a lot of friends in that time, wanted to be alone yet I was lonely. I've done therapy (still do), tried several different medications, and had my ups and downs with my symptoms, but earlier this year, things got bad. I missed work several times, was very hopeless about the future. I even looked into going on disability just to not have to deal with anything anymore. At least that's the short story.\n\nMy therapist had just hired a person that specialized in neurofeedback treatment and she recommended I try it since I was struggling so much. I got more information on it and decided give it a try, I was desperate. The way I understand it, they match these sound waves to match the frequencies of your brain, then they adjust the frequencies to \"calm\" your mind. Overtime, your brain responds to this and changes. I would ruminate a lot, and get emotional about it, panic...well this like slows down the rumination. This treatment is used for other mental conditions like adhd and addiction (which I also have issues with). I can't remember the exact type I did, but I believe it is a slow wave form, perhaps infra-low frequency neurofeedback.\n\nAt the beginning of each session, not sure if this common though, I would do some slow breathing first and practice breathing deep. Then, she (my specialist) connected these electrodes to my head, and she put a movie on and played these sound waves that respond to your brain patterns. The movie is just to occupy your time, each session was 30 min. My specialists would ask me questions about how I was feeling and adjusted some things (the frequencies?) to tailor it to my needs. I had some weird effects early on, like I would feel itchy sometimes, or I could feel pressure in my head. But after a couple of weeks I was starting to feel better. Like, while I still wasn't happy with some things in my life,  my anxiety decreased drastically. I started it in February and by May my outlook on life was changing, I was more optimistic and didn't dread the future as much.\n\nI have concluded my treatment for now (August), but I am a changed person. I haven't had a panic attack in a long time. I am more social, and I am actually looking forward to work. If I do get down or worried it usually has to do with my missing a dose of my medication (Viibryd). I haven't even taken a xanax in months.\n\nI wanted to post this as a recommendation for those who are struggling. If I could be a commercial for this I would lol. I can't believe that it worked for me. Your brain can change! With anxiety and depression it's like the wiring in your head is just messed up, this like tunes it back up. I see a lot of posts that remind me of myself on here (or perhaps my \"old self\") and wanted to share this in case it could help anyone out there. Of course, naturally I do worry that it won't \"stick\", but according to the research, it should, but I can go in for a \"booster\" if I need to.\nMy insurance covered it, I had to do it twice a week at first, then dropped to once towards the end. Talk to your therapist or doctor and see if you can find a specialist in your area.\n\ntl/dr- Neurofeedback saved me from the grips of depression and anxiety, it \"calms\" your brain down. I hope it can help you too. Talk to your doc or therapist about it.\n\nIf you have questions, I'll try my best to answer them.\n\nTake care everyone!",
