            "selftext": "There doesn't seem to be an in between, and it feels like flipping a switch sometimes. For the record, I am on medication (Wellbutrin) for depression and ADHD, and seeing a therapist, though it's been a month. \n\nI was feeling like I was doing really great at work lately: been there for over a year and finally starting to carve my niche, good camaraderie with co-workers even if my anxiety prevented me from taking them up on invitations ever, newer coworkers came to me needing help which made me feel competent and needed, I was being recognized for my sales numbers -  I feel like a normal person would look at this, and be like, wow, I'm doing great. And I did, until today, when I didn't. \n\nThis morning, I got a bill from the hospital from a biopsy I had done last month (want to talk about anxiety inducing? Waiting for the phone call to find out if you have cancer or not). I was expecting it, but the amount still shocked me. It was more than I had in my account. But I was running late for work so I put it in my bag and left. Today was an important day, and it was very busy, and I was already on edge. I work in sales, I sell electronics, and normally I think I am pretty good at it. I'm good at dealing with difficult customers, being patient with people who don't understand technology, etc. But today they just made everything worse - after a few old people who don't know how to work computers yelled at me, I had to excuse myself to the bathroom and sat there for 15 minutes hyperventilating and crying. When I get out my manager can tell I've been crying, and asks me what's wrong, which sets me off again. Long story short is, I left work early and spent the rest of my day beating myself up and thinking how I'm going to get fired. Even though my workplace is very understanding and everyone today was supportive when they saw me upset. I hate crying in front of people and I'm terrified of going back tomorrow, thought I know I have to. \n\nI'm normally good at reminding myself all the positives about my life - until I have a bad day, and then it feels impossible even to say to myself \"I'm not stupid,\". What do you do when you have a day go out of control like that? How do you get yourself out of that bear-trap of negative, untrue thoughts? One thing that helps, a bit, is the non-zero way of thinking, there's a post somewhere on here but I think you can google it too.  Sometimes, if I can tell myself to just take things one micro step at a time, one foot and then the other, I can dig my way out and just focus of mundane, tiny victories until I feel less anxious. \n\nSorry if this was unfocused or doesn't belong here, I don't post often.

Tracking my mood and energy level over time is really helpful with dealing with my anxiety especially, and I've been using pen and paper to do so. Now, as I implement features (ie stats and graphs) i'll be able to see what sort of things bring my mood up or down.\n\nHere is the link:\n\nhttp://mood.marcelli.ca\n\nRegistration is 1-step mostly because I haven't implemented 2-step. Quick and easy. Try not to kill my droplet &lt;3.\n\nIf you are interested in helping dev:\n\nhttps://github.com/lucasmarcelli/mood-tracker\n\nIf you have suggestions, raise an issue on github or make a comment here. \n\nPlanned features:\n\n* Stats and Graphs\n* Allow user to track custom metrics\n* Facebook/google/othermedia integration \n* Email to limit registration if not using facebook/google(pls no spam guys...)\n\nEdit:\n\n94 users signed up and made at least 1 entry, 85 have made 2. I'm really, really happy that the response to this is so good. This is doing WONDERS for my anxiety right now guys :)",

I wouldn't ever kill myself for several reasons, I don't think I would actually be able to go through with it, and I would never do that to my friends and family. But, honestly, I think about how much easier it would be if I were just dead. \nAgain, I'm not suicidal. I'm just so incredibly exhausted from just barely making it through the day because of my anxiety. I'm so tired of ending the day with the thought of, \"oh I just need to sleep it off and I won't be worried about it tomorrow\". And while that's partially true, yesterdays anxieties are just replaced with new ones. \nI feel so trapped in this cycle. It feels like there's no hope of ending it, and that I just have to live every day in fear of the next day. I end every day feeling empty and shaky, so mentally fragile that the slightest upset will break me. I can't see myself ever getting through my anxiety, I just can't possibly imagine a solution at all. \n\nEdit #1: Just to add a bit of information, I am on medication. I've been medicated for 3 years now. My therapist and I messed with the dosage for a while in the beginning, but it has stayed consistent for the past 2 years. Because of my switch in doctors recently, I asked about possibly changing meds or at least the dosage of my current medication. I really feel like I need something that you take as needed. My new doctor informed me that with OCD, it typically doesn't help to have a take as needed medication. I feel like my baseline anxiety level is lower than it was in years past, but I am more prone to panic attacks than I was before. I feel like it comes in waves now, and the anxiety I have during those waves are much more severe than my baseline anxiety was on a general basis. Keep in mind, this new doctor is not a psychologist or psychiatrist, just simply a general practitioner that I sought out in order to fill prescriptions here in college.  ",

The decision itself worries me, the money and debt terrifies me, and then it goes on to thinking about what it will be like to be somewhere new. Will I break down once I get there? Probably. I used to think I had my shit under control but whenever I start to think that, a major breakdown happens. It's constantly on my mind and it makes me sick.\n\nI can't clear my head at all. I feel defeated. My life is a wreck and I'm supposed to make important decisions. I can't deal with change. I need to find a way to deal with this. I'm increasing my dose of klonopin to help after having panic attacks at school every other day. I'm getting frustrated at my inability to deal with normal things. ",

Well today I wrote a draft of a cover letter to a company in the state I'll be moving to.  It was just a draft for a volunteer position, not a paying job, but my friends and I agree that I'll need to secure a situation to give me some structure in order to stay sane, while I look for paid work, so they are supportive of me trying to find a volunteer opportunity now so I'll have that when I go out there.  \n\nI'm proud that I worked on the cover letter, and it also eases my anxiety when I actually face the task that I fear so much.  \n\nI also got to the gym today.

I recognize the title of this post may seem like an irresponsible child trying to have his cake and eat it too, but I'm really just looking for information.\n\nI love beer. I'm a beer hobbyist. I brew. I drink. I take vacations specifically to places with quality beers I want to try. Beer is a favorite hobby of mine. I respect beer and the laws. I drink responsibly. I get drunk sometimes. I never treat alcohol as a poultice for the mental wounds of the world (although it's *real* tempting some days). I'm just a beer lover. \n\nI'm also getting horrible panic/anxiety attacks (\"chronic stress reactions\" is my official diagnosis) and have, recently, had to check myself to prevent from getting up in people's grill for talking at me (\"at me\" not \"to me\") at work. I cry on the way home some days. If there was ever someone in need of medication, it's me. However, I've held off on being seen by a therapist because I feel like once I get my pills, that's the end of my beer drinking which, honestly, is like the Ninja Turtles giving up pizza. I'm \"the beer guy\" in my circle. It's part of who I am. It is known that I have a love for the oat soda.\n\nSo I'm looking for information on how to reconcile the need for medication and the hobby I love. I know that drinking on meds is by-and-large a no-no, and if that's the answer, then that's the answer and I'll live with it, but does anyone have any experience in drinking while on medication? Can I get away with once a week? Once a month? I don't know what the rules are. Anyone have any information that might help me out? ",

I told him my anxiety story, how it started and how I struggled with it.

            "selftext": "So backstory- I have had generalized anxiety disorder for a little over 4 years. Past all the medicines and therapists, I have learned to control it fairly well over the years, with just some occasional flair ups. \n\nI'm sorry this is long. \n\nTl;dr: a six hour panic attack sent me back to square one in my anxiety. Everything that is usually easy is so hard for me to do right now. I need to know I'll be okay. \n\nI don't even know what happened last night. Everything just went downhill so fast... \n\nI was coming home from visiting my family, and during the hour and a half drive by myself, I started getting bad dissociation. So bad I almost pulled over twice to panic, but I kept myself on track.\n\nI finally got home, and found my boyfriend asleep. I woke him and asked him to come into the living room with me. He was very groggy and upset and I started panicking. \n\nHe eventually went into the living room with me and then I accidentally knocked over something of his and started crying hysterically because I thought he would be mad at me. \n\nHe told me he couldn't deal with it so he left to go to the gas station. I started to calm down. He came back. Later, he went to bed and I followed. \n\nI have an intense fear of the dark and the night. And the left over panic started creeping back. I started crying, and my brain literally felt like it was crumbling in on itself. I felt like I was going to go mad. I contemplated going to the hospital. I couldn't stop thinking about terrible things, and shaking. \n\nWe laid down at 11, but I didn't get to sleep till 2.\n\nI woke up at 11am, and I was so incredibly exhausted. My eyes are still heavy, and my brain is foggy. \n\nI'm currently at work and I feel like I'm doing everything wrong. I am usually on top of my game and can get everything done quickly, but today is so much different. I feel like I'm doing everything wrong. I can't deal with the crowds that flood in every half hour. \n\nMy eyes are heavy, my brain is heavy, I have tunnel vision and I feel like I'm on autopilot. I don't feel like myself. I haven't felt like this in years. I'm on the verge of panicking at any second. I just want to be okay. I just want to feel normal and not have these lingering feelings that I had last night. \n\nThis panic attack took a huge toll on me. A toll I haven't felt in years. \n\nHas anyone else went years without something major and then all of sudden it's like you're back to your worst point? Cause that's how I feel. I want to know it'll pass and I'll be okay again. \n\nSorry if this is a jumbled mess of words. I'm so tired and my brain just hurts. I needed to get this out. ",

Having to clean my room, clean the dishes, getting out of bed, sex, going outside, being with people, trying to fall asleep, reading the news, trying to learn something, reading something cool, watching an engaging series (if it's something really cool that makes you go like \"holy shit\" and like life more it actually makes me anxious for no reason), sound.. Sorry for the rant I just don't know what the fuck to do and the only thing making it go away is nicotine, self harm etc. My boyfriend helps a lot but yeah as I mentioned now I can't even have sex with him. Have an appointment with the psychologist tomorrow, want to ask again (sigh, again) for meds",

But, I don't want to put her through that stress if the outcomes aren't going to make a realistic, positive change on her, and our, life. \n\nWhat therapy is available?
