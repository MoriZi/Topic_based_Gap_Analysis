            "selftext": "Came across news this morning that Hip Hop celebrity Kid Cudi checks himself into rehab for depression and suicidal thoughts. He wrote this letter to his fans where anxiety is mentioned.\nJust wanted to say that none of us are alone in our fight with anxiety.\n\nHere is the letter: \n\n\"Its been difficult for me to find the words to what Im about to share with you because I feel ashamed. Ashamed to be a leader and hero to so many while admitting I\u2019ve been living a lie. It took me a while to get to this place of commitment, but it is something I have to do for myself, my family, my best friend/daughter and all of you, my fans.\nYesterday I checked myself into rehab for depression and suicidal urges.\n\nI am not at peace. I haven\u2019t been since you\u2019ve known me. If I didn\u2019t come here, I wouldve done something to myself. I simply am a damaged human swimming in a pool of emotions everyday of my life. Theres a ragin violent storm inside of my heart at all times. Idk what peace feels like. Idk how to relax. My anxiety and depression have ruled my life for as long as I can remember and I never leave the house because of it. I cant make new friends because of it. I dont trust anyone because of it and Im tired of being held back in my life. I deserve to have peace. I deserve to be happy and smiling. Why not me? I guess I give so much of myself to others I forgot that I need to show myself some love too. I think I never really knew how. Im scared, im sad, I feel like I let a lot of people down and again, Im sorry. Its time I fix me. Im nervous but ima get through this.\n\nI wont be around to promote much, but the good folks at Republic and my manager Dennis will inform you about upcoming releases. The music videos, album release date etc. The album is still on the way. Promise. I wanted to square away all the business before I got here so I could focus on my recovery.\n\nIf all goes well ill be out in time for Complexcon and ill be lookin forward to seeing you all there for high fives and hugs.\n\nLove and light to everyone who has love for me and I am sorry if I let anyone down. I really am sorry. Ill be back, stronger, better. Reborn. I feel like shit, I feel so ashamed. Im sorry.\n\nI love you,\n\nScott Mescudi",

I am so scared of missing out of the things at home, messing up at work, going for job interviews, making phone calls. I cannot be a functioning member of society. I wish I knew why I was like this, but I don't understand it myself.\n\nMy family and my boyfriend harass me about it nonstop. Asking multiple times a day if I got a job, to just suck it up, that \"nobody wants to work\". It has done nothing but hate myself more than I already do. I go to sleep stressing about a job, its the first thing I think of when I wake up, it's always the main conversation. My boyfriend is constantly upset with me because I don't have a job. I'm upset with myself.\n\nI live within my means. I don't go and do anything super expensive, I make sure I have money from babysitting gigs, etc. I don't expect anyone to pay for me for anything.\n\nDoes anyone have advice? I am really at a loss and have been spiraling downhill. Thank you in advanced..\n\nTl;dr Cant get a job because of my anxiety, hate myself because of it.",

            "selftext": "Let me know if this is the wrong place to post this. I'm really confused about what to do and I'm looking for some insight into anxiety to hopefully help me with the situation \n\nMy boyfriend at I have been dating for 10 months and he's had some pretty severe anxiety over this time. It's usually related to a very understandable source of stress (i.e. a big exam, his job messing up his pay etc.). He get's terrified and becomes a non functional person (doesn't eat, doesn't shower, sleeps a weird times). When he get's anxious he \"hides\" and won't answer his phone. He'll spend all day in bed or playing video games. However, this also means he flakes on plans to talk on the phone or skype (we're in an LDR while I'm at grad school). He used to do it when he was in school but now I'm worried it's going to cost him his job (he hasn't skipped work or anything but I fear it could happen). \n\nEarlier in the year I encouraged him to seek help and find a therapist which he did and things got a bit better. He's backsliding now. He doesn't have a lot of money and can only afford to go once a month. I've told him to ask about sliding scales but he hasn't. \n\nEarlier today he flaked on some plans to hide so I sent him this text: \n\n\"I find it frustrating when you fake on plans because you\u2019re hiding. You said you wanted to Skype tonight when I proposed it and I was really looking forward to seeing you. I understand that this situation is beyond stressful but you\u2019re letting it control your life like [the last big scary thing] did. This isn\u2019t a sustainable way of managing your anxiety and I\u2019m really worried about you.\" \n\nWhen I try to tell him how I feel about the situation it just ends up with me comforting him because he gets anxious about being a bad boyfriend. I have anxiety problems myself which I treat with medication and therapy so I understand where he's coming from but I'm getting worn out. I really love him and there's a thousand amazing things about him which make me want to be in a relationship with him. But I can't do this anymore. I'm emotionally exhausted. This situation triggers my own anxiety and I don't know what to do. ",

            "selftext": "My anxiety was so embarassing to me. I'd shake, I'd find it hard to breath, my self esteem was non existent. I was always scared of looking strange.\n\nI literally remember going from my school to college at 16 and suddenly finding myself in this situation where I felt inferior to other people. I was stressed, I couldn't deal with put downs from my friend who had her own self esteem issues.\n\nMy whole personality started changing, and it only got worse.\n\nUntil I started on Propranolol not even two months ago.\n\nIt stops the physical effects of anxiety, and although I did at first, now I don't worry about having a panic attack. It's not so much not panicking that has helped me, it's more that I can do things without the fear of the humiliation of having a panic attack or the way anxiety would show.\n\nWithin two months I have started to feel confident again and I don't really mind about what other's think.\n\nOne example of how far I have come...\n\nYesterday I got on the train and there I saw a person who hates me. We used to be very very close friends, and then in my opinion she betrayed me and she went all out hateful. I was so hurt, we had been best friends, our other best friend also got a horrid treatment to the point where she was crying and me and her mum couldn't calm her down because she had stuck up for me to this other friend, this girl said nasty things about my partner. That was the straw where me and my friend decided that, when this girl was bringing family and loved ones into it, it was just time to say bye. This girl had to be the one who got rid of us however, deleted us on all social media, blocked us, made it fairly public. Whatever, it was unpleasant for all involved.\n\nI don't really \"hate\" people.\n\nSo anyway, I saw this person on the train, and they saw me as I got on. They glared at me and looked away quickly. I had to walk past to find a seat, and we made eye contact. Usually I'd find something like this awkward, I'd be very uncomfortable, my heart would be racing, I'd feel crap about myself because I'm reminded someone out there doesn't like me and went out of their way to be mean to me and people I thought we both cared about for standing by me (not even taking sides, just not wanting me to be treated like crap).\n\n*Yesterday I smiled and said hello to this person.*\n\nI phoned my partner up on my way home to tell him and we laughed - a lot. I'm still socially awkward, but at least I don't give a fuck about it anymore. I held my head high and continued to walk past and find a seat. She turned from a glaring look on her face, to one of instant grumpiness and looked away. I was still having a fairly good day.\n\nI still worry about things and sometimes I avoid stuff for fear that it will send me into a panic or an emotional fit of tears that I can't do things... But I've made so much progress that everyone can see it.",

            "selftext": "I feel guilty after almost every conversation I have with a stranger. I always feel like I messed something up, may have offended them somehow, came off as weird, etc.\n\nExamples just from today: The cashier seemed super annoyed because she had to point to the tiny \"swipe only\" sign when I tried to shove my card into the chip reader.  I felt so stupid that I actually sat in my car and cried after.\n\n I called to make a therapist appt. late at night- expecting to leave a vm, and she picked up and said she was mid-session and I again felt really dumb and cried.\n\nThe crying is new, thus the therapy appt. Every tiny inconvenience feels like a last straw situation lately.\nHowever  I have always struggled with feeling guilty ALL THE TIME. Over EVERYTHING. \n\nIf I'm talking to someone I'm close to I feel defensive, like I have to prove I'm not stupid, and am very sensitive to any kind of rejection or criticism- even if it's a joke I have to hide that I feel hurt because I know it's not meant poorly. I think this is linked to fear of feeling ashamed, which is in the same vein as guilt.\n\nHas anyone else struggled with similar issues to this and overcome them? Can anyone offer advice to, I don't know, not feel guilty over nothing? Or can you relate at least?\n\nI know that the rational response to both of the situations  I mentioned is literally just forgetting about it because its no big deal. I don't know why I'm a big wet towel about it.\n",

I haven't talked to any of my IRL friends in weeks and the only place I've been talking to my online/long distance friends was we would play DnD over Skype once a week but we can't do that anymore because of scheduling. I kinda want to delete this post. I'm freaked out every time I go to say something and somehow it's even worse when texting. I used to at least be able to do that. I have one friend who actually tries to talk to me and I'm even scared shitless to talk to her because I don't want to lose the only friend I still have. I hate anxiety. \n\n\nEDIT: It is a great relief and also highly saddening to see so many others who understand. None of us should feel this way and it sucks. It's a relief to know others are going through the same thing, but no one should go through this. I hope it gets better for all of us. Thank you all for your advice and comments. \n\nPs for those of you saying to get help I was to the doctor the day before I made this post and I'm supposed to start therapy next week. ",

I've also been working with a therapist to help manage my panic disorder for a few years. \n\nThis job is not at all what I expected. I was told that it had a pretty good work-life balance, but for the last 2 months we've been expected to get in at 9 and work until much later than 9 in the evening. Lots of people are sleeping in the office because they have to stay in so late, and when people start leaving for the night, the CEO sends out emails about how if we worked smarter we wouldn't have to work so late, and that he expects to see everyone giving 110% first thing in the morning. \n\nBecause of the hours I haven't been able to see my family or girlfriend very much since I started. I've also been dealing with some insurance issues (on my therapist's side, our company HR has done everything right) and that's made things worse. I've been having panic attacks most days in the office and today I had one at the thought of going back in to deal with this stuff again tomorrow. \n\nI know that something needs to change here but I don't have any faith that it will. From what I've heard, the CEO won't approve any new hires because he sincerely thinks that we can get everything done in a 9-5 work week. \n\nI don't really know what to do. I'm not sure if I'm mishandling things because I haven't seen my therapist in a while and I don't know how to bring this up with my boss. I've heard from him that people are wondering why I got to leave early for my therapy appointments (when I had them) and they seem unwilling to discuss accommodations. \n\nI don't know how to handle this situation and I don't know what to do if I get fired.

            "selftext": "I've been lurking around these parts for a while now, and just wanted to share a bit of good news!\n\nI passed my driving test today, after a year of lessons. I took many more hours of lessons and outside practice than most people do. But I did it, first time!\n\nHere are the things that got me through it, in the hopes that maybe they can help someone here. Maybe you can apply some of them to other kinds of exams too. \n\n- Try and get a bit of sleep beforehand, even if it's just a few naps. My mind was racing last night, and I had to do some deep breathing and visualisations (I visualised successfully doing the difficult manoeuvres). If you can't sleep, at least stay rested: lie down, read a book, do calm things that don't deplete your energy. \n\n-Don't tell too many people about your test. I told my immediate family only so I wouldn't wake up to an inbox full of good luck messages. Also, if I did fail, I'd only have to tell a couple of people rather than broadcasting it to the world. \n\n- Get up in the morning with plenty of time to spare. I managed to get on a bit of makeup; looking good = feeling good (for me at least)\n\n- Banana for breakfast! Your stomach will probably tell you otherwise, but you gotta get that potassium and tryptophan! (Potassium helps with the shakes, tryptophan makes ya feel happy :D)\n\n- No caffeine (oops). I am weak and couldn't resist a cup of the freshly brewed coffee my brother made, but seriously, it doesn't help with your nerves. \n\n- Deep breathing again. I had a short drive around with my instructor first, then we went to the test centre. I sat in a waiting room for a few minutes and took the time to get my breathing under control. Out breaths longer than in breaths, breath with your diaphragm, the usual. \n\n- Be prepared for some surprises! I was randomly selected to have an invigilator sit with me to check the examiner was doing his job properly, so I ended up with a full house. I opted to have my instructor in the car with me so I had a friendly face, and if I did fail he would know exactly where I went wrong. (I'm in the UK, where you can have your instructor with you. You may not be able to in other places though.)\n\n- Did I mention deep breathing? I had a few panics during the test in which I found myself not breathing at all. I must have looked like a beetroot before I remembered that oxygen is a thing. I also took a wrong turn and felt that icy cold dread where everything tingles and the colour drains from your face. Seriously, just getting the little voice inside to pipe up with \"Breathe!\" Saved the day a few times. \n\n- Try to put the past behind you. I made what I thought would be two fail-worthy errors, but tried telling myself \"just maybe...\" And it turned out that my reactions after the errors worked in my favour. As soon as you panic, you make more mistakes, which the examiner is tallying up. If you can acknowledge the mistake and say \"yup, that just happened. Anyway, let's carry on, what's next?\" Then you're onto a winner.\n\nIf there's anything else that anyone wants to know, please feel free to message me. Best of luck in your endeavours, my anxious friends. Remember to breathe ;)\n",
