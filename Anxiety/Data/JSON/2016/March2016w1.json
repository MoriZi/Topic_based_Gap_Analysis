Again thanks for making my day turn around for the better.\n\nEDIT2: Just got home from work. You guys are INCREDIBLE! I knew it was a great community when I got a few responses but Holy shit! It's really great to see you all have my back. I am so relieved and thankful for all the positive comments!\n\n----------------\n\nNot sure if this is the right place, but I tried searching for the correct sub and I felt you guys would probably be able to answer.\n\nI have been seeing a therapist for about a month for anxiety/suicidal ideation.  I live relatively far away, and my commute is about 1 hr by subway.  Subway frequently gets delayed and they only come every 15 minutes.  The first two appointments went fine, though I was 5 min late for the second.  The third I had to cancel because of my job (co-worker called in sick the day of so I had to cancel my appointment). I left ample, but &amp;amp;amp;lt;24h, notice, and offered to pay for the missed session.\n\nFast forward to today. I was again 5 min late. Instead of saying hello, the dude just started chewing me out for being 'disrespectful.'  He admitted he was 'getting heated' and I apologized profusely.  At some point he said, \"Do you even want to get better? What's the point if you don't even respect me enough to come on time?\"  I apologized again, and he said \"Sounds like youre just paying me lip service.\"  I said I didn't know what to say, and he repeated again about disrespect. I was calm the entire time, but he was certainly not.  I felt like my mother was yelling at me for not cleaning my room.\n\nAt some point, I just said, \"This isn't working. How much do I owe?\" He gave me the bill, and again said, *very* snarkily, \"I would be remiss if I didn't say that you are not going to succeed unless you commit, but I do not think you want to.\"  I replied, \"You'll get your check\" and left.\n\nI mean, wtf? Am I crazy or is that wholly unprofessional? I will admit that I could have tried to be 15 mins early but I didn't know I would be yelled at.\n\ntl;dr Therapist yelled at me for being late. Is that appropriate?",

            "selftext": "I realized today after browsing this sub that in the past year I've come a LONG ways from where I'd been for most of my life.\n\nI've figured out through therapy what the main issue is - a diagnosis of PTSD - and another side issue unrelated to the main diagnosis - gender dysphoria.\n\nI weened myself off of a five year addiction to klonopin, got switched to Xanax which I now only take before a particularly stressful day/event or when I feel a panic attack arising, and was approved for HRT (hormone replacement therapy) last July with the help of my therapist and a really great, new doctor. \n\nFor the first time in my entire life, I finally like myself, and I'm unafraid to leave the house or socialize or go to job interviews, etc. I no longer hate the way I look and think that everyone hates me or thinks I'm ugly or annoying or whatever worry would pop into my head on a regular basis. I like my life, and myself, and I've really grown and changed for the better. Of course I do still have anxious moments, and I will probably be in therapy for a long time to help with my PTSD and my phobia of death, but overall, I've realized that I'm finally in a good, healthy place mentally. My anxiety is no longer consuming me and is not the focus of my life. \n\nSo, I'm going to unsub. I thought about staying, but I feel like if I did I would be living in or remembering my past a bit vicariously through some of these posts. Kinda like, you know how if you think about a panic attack and all the symptoms of it, you might end up actually making yourself have one? It's sort of like that. I just want to let go of that part of me in a way and keep moving forward. I used to come here and read posts mostly for the advice/help and to feel less alone in my worries and fears. Now, hopefully one day, I hope to come back here after I finish school to become a therapist and feel a bit more qualified to offer legitimate help in return to you guys.\n\nIt can get better. Don't give up. I wish you all the best.\n\nEdit: thank all of you guys for the replies! I can't wait for you all to be able to post a success story as well! You can make it through this! Take it one day at a time. &lt;3 ",

Every template for how to write resumes and cover letters basically tells me the same thing: to sell myself, to detail my strengths, to self-advocate. But I can't. Not only because I really don't like lying but because the more I try to sell myself, the more I pretend that I'm a functional person who can handle his shit, the more likely it is that if someone were to hire me and give me some responsibility the more likely I will be to fuck it up. I have had jobs in the past (working for my parents so no application process was needed) where this exact thing happened: too much stress, too much responsibility and I damn near have panic attacks as a result.\n\nI feel like I need to be honest about how little I value myself and how little I feel like I'm capable of and yet obviously that's a sure way to get nobody to hire me.\n\nAnyone have any advice?

            "selftext": "So, I have a few old online friends, friends from college, and a much larger friend group that I met through my boyfriend of 3 years. I don't have any problems talking to my college friends, since they are primarily the ones that initiate conversation, and chatting online is easy, because I have time to think about what to say, but it's much harder to *continue* conversations in person with the friends I've made through my boyfriend. \n\nI've mastered small talk, i.e. \"How have you been?\" \"Whatcha been up to?\" \"I hate the weather right now, don't you?\", and I chime in on jokes that were said by others - and that seems to work fine -  but I know that only goes so far, and I feel like a \"one trick pony.\" \n\nI've tried thinking of things to talk about before I'm going to interact with them, but I either forget about what I'm going to say, or it doesn't sound at all interesting once I've said it. The disinterest shows in their tone or on their faces and I just feel really stupid afterwards. Any time this happens, I think back to an event that I attended in high school. I was talking about something and the person that I was talking to screamed \"NO ONE CARES\" and everyone around started to laugh at me. Yes, this actually happened. (Going into the worst 4 years of my life is another slippery slope for another day.)\n\nI've talked to my boyfriend about it several times and he's been very sympathetic about it until recently, which is understandable. He continues to reassure me that when I'm not around, his friends say nothing but good things about me, so I shouldn't worry, but that doesn't stop the super-anxious feelings in that moment. I've know this group for over 2 years and I'm still having issues? I'm annoyed at myself to the point of tears.\n\nI know that most of my worries are in my head, but telling myself that doesn't make those feelings go away. I have coping techniques, but they only work after the encounter is over and everyone has gone home. \n\nYes, I sought out professional help; I talked to a therapist, but she focused on other issues that she felt were more important. I\u2019ve also talked with a psychologist and have been diagnosed. \nUnfortunately, there are no anxiety support groups where I live.\n\n**TLDR:** I get very anxious when interacting with people. My mind just goes blank. I hate feeling like no one likes me because I never say anything worth talking about. I would really like some suggestions on where to even start to fix this or get over it.\nPlease help!",

Unfortunately, it got to the point where the combination of my anxiety, lack of treatment (medication, therapy), combined with depression led me to be committed to a hospital because of suicidal ideations.  \n\nFast forward through a lot, I was transferred to another unit, am on a good medication regimen, have gone through therapy, and have an excellent primary care physician.  I am in a really good place.  \n\nHowever, the people in charge decided that they would bring the person who seriously emotionally and verbally abused me to work in the same office, saying \"trust us, we'll make her be nice.\"\n\nInstead of having a full on meltdown, I was able to be really honest with myself.  While I have improved a lot in the behavioral health department, I know that I am not to the point where I can handle even one cutting phrase from her.  \n\nI am disappointed in myself that I still allow this individual to affect me in this way, but I talked it over with my husband, and we are in a great place financially so it's not a huge deal.  \n\nStill, I am worried.  I feel like I should be more panicked (thank goodness for medication and therapy or I'd be in a worse spot).  Honestly, I'm proud of myself for making this decision and standing up for myself, but at the same time I feel like there's this huge unknown and I worry that I'm making this decision way too quickly.\n\nI appreciate everyone here and the open forum.  I think I feel better just by telling my story.  Any advice is appreciated, but just typing this out is cathartic.  ",

We are blessed by nature with this amazing imagination and while it can be our worst enemy, why don t we make a pact with it? Why don t we forgive ourselves? Why do we blame ourselves  so much? \n\n\nWe got this far! We keep breathing. I am so damn grateful for this air that comes through my lungs! For every breath! Keep trying. You fail, try again.

            "selftext": "I never really rant or let out my whole story etc, and it'd just be really nice to have someone relate or be able to help or just read it.\n\nI've always been shy and anxious. Although i never knew what anxiety was until I was about 17 or 18. (I'm going to be 19 this month). My anxiety became pretty horrible around 8th grade. I always just thought to myself \"why do i have to be so SHY?\" i never even knew anxiety existed.\n\nFast forward to October 2015. Early October, or the middle of Oct. I don't remember. Anyway, I'm in a \"relationship\" with this asshole who was manipulative, mean, didn't really give a shit about me except for my mouth and vagina, and was embarrassed of me because i didn't smoke weed and wasn't popular. I was just really at a bad time in my life, super anxious, really bad social anxiety (developed around 14 years old but worsened around age 16) and i was so ignorant and just so dumb, i stayed in the \"relationship\", but luckily it ended after just over a month. \n\nSo, middle of October or so I keep being called a baby, lame, a loser, boring, stupid, not cool, and embarrassing because I didn't smoke weed. I have nothing against it, i just wasn't interested. Being the depressed and constantly worried person i am i thought \"well if i don't do it i'll look lame and like a loser.\" \n\nthe next day after work i come home, take pics and show him me smoking, and soon after begin feeling in a daze, so dizzy and lost i couldn't even figure out where i was. i was somewhat mentally \"there\" but was also going crazy. that wasn't what being high felt like, i just knew it. i have no clue where i am by this point, I think i'm dying, or lost in a dream, taken to another world, but still standing in the upstairs hallway i managed to run out to. i start screaming for my mom. SCREAMING. i just remember screaming and screaming, i thought i was dead. i thought no one could see me. i could see but i wasn't \"there\". it was an out of body experience. i never wanted to go through that again. screaming, randomly crying so hard, shaking, feeling insane, like i'm dying, my hands and feet tingling like crazy, nausea, chest pain, heart beating. the weed had to have been laced, right? my mom rushes me to the hospital. i continue screaming. i was so lost. was i dying? i had no clue. i go to the hospital. they do tests and just tell me it was a \"bad reaction\". \n\ni tell my \"BF\" the next day and he tells me to stop being such a baby, i did that to myself and i'm so stupid and weak. he was embarrassed and broke up with me over it.\n\ni became depressed. after researching i concluded the built up YEARS of anxiety and worrying and fears were just on the verge of erupting and the weed triggered a panic attack. from october to late january i was in constant fear. constant fear. everyday. of another panic attack. it ended up happening again, and the DPDR or depersonalization (out of body feeling) still hasn't gone away from the last panic attack. it's mild but still makes me depressed and scared. i feel hopeless a lot.\n\ni'm scared to sleep. i have constant fears. i can't see a therapist, psychiatrist, etc because my insurance doesn't cover them. i'm afraid of living in constant fear or going through a panic attack again. it's always a worry for me. I'm so depressed, anxious and sad some days i just can't stop crying. my panic attacks last hours. HOURS. the first one lasted 4-5 hours. the second lasting 3. everything i listed above from my weed PA is what goes on the whole time i have it. What ends them is i eventually fall asleep, but wake up so many times and freak out or somehow try to make sure i'm \"real\". ughhhhh, i just.. i don't know",

            "selftext": "So I have pretty bad anxiety, and a lot of it is because of recent events in my life, making me sometimes feel like a failure and completely hopeless. Even if it's not that extreme, every day I feel like I'm forgetting something or missing something or doing something wrong. There are a lot of actual worries too, like job prospects, money, issues with my girlfriend of 5 years, and more.\n\nI will be moving home with my parents in a few months, and possibly starting a new job about an hour commute away. This is a new stress in my life.\n\nAnyways, I do realize I need discipline, and I badly want to change. I've been trying in the last few days. However, I'm terrified about the free time I'll lose every day. I think about the hour commute + 8 hours (if not more) work every day. So I'll have to get up very early if I want to do any disciplined activities like exercise and stuff. Then I'll get home late, and have little time before I have to sleep at 10-11pm. And it can only get worse if I decide to go back to school (night classes or online for second bachelors).\n\nFirst of all, my night routine is the happiest time in my life almost. I love watching TV and messing with my phone before bed. If I have to give this up, I feel like I'll be even more unhappy. Then there's spending time with my family, especially my little sister who is somehow one of my best friends (she's only 11). I love video games, and also feel like I'm losing so much time for that, part of which is playing with my sister.\n\nFinally, there's my girlfriend of 5 years. We've been very long distance for most of that, Skyping and texting, and only getting to see each other in person every 6 months. She's closer now, but still 3 hours away. I feel like with a full time job and \"disciplined activities\", I'll also lose Skype time with her. And maybe it will be harder to visit her every few weekends. And when she goes for her PhD in 1.5 years, then it'll really be hard with shitty vacation time with work. At least when we visited each other before, we had about a month together at a time.\n\nI'm just rambling on now and I know this maybe belongs on another subreddit. Anyways, I'm just feeling so conflicted and just wanna give up. I'm not suicidal, but some nights I do feel like it would be easier to just not ever wake up. Will I ever be able to be happy with this lost time in my day? Can I get over losing my night routine and other stuff?\n\nI just feel like I'm not capable of being an adult. It's like I'm choosing between being unhappy with my lack of disciplined life or unhappy with my lack of time. I don't know what to do or think anymore.",
