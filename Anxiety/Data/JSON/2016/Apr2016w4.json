            "selftext": "I am a High School English Teacher. I am also Bipolar, and have lived with anxiety and depression my entire life. It took me nearly 27 years of denial, bottling it in, periods of extreme highs and lows, and constant nagging anxiety before my now wife convinced me to seek medical help - I'm doing much better now thanks to finding the right therapist and psychiatrist :). But enough about me!\n\nToday I was heading down to the copy room to print up some tests for my next class, and I saw an overweight kid (I was a chunky kid in school as well) sitting against the wall. He was shaking and crying, clearly having a panic attack. There were other teachers, and someone from security around him. My coworkers (doing what they thought was right) were asking him over and over \"What's wrong\", \"What happened?\", \"Do you need to talk to someone?\", \"Why are you stressed?\". Every time he would just repeat the same words \"I'm just stressed out\", spiraling worse and worse as he was bombarded.\n\nI came over to check on him, and after seeing what was happening I asked if he could come to my room to decompress for a second, i was on planning after all. They agreed, and we walked over to my classroom. I told him that I have generalized anxiety disorder, and that I've done exactly what he did. Many a time I've let it all overwhelm me and I couldn't tell the people around me any one reason \"why\", when it was just a little bit of everything. I told him that he didn't need to explain, that I knew and understood, and my room was a safe space for him.\n\nHe sat there for about 20 minutes, he cried a little more. Composed himself and then told me his name was Eddie. I told Eddie that if he ever needs a safe place that I'll be there for him, and I walked him back to his class, and then ran to make copies of my test.\n\nI hope the rest of his day goes well, and I hope that i've made a good impact on him. Even now I worry that he might be anxious still, but I have faith that he will find the way just like I did.\n\n",

They are like movies, very realistic stuff, and they feel like they last all night, from the time I go to bed to when I wake up. This results in me being totally exhausted in the morning, even though I technically get enough sleep (about 8 hours). \nThey are so vivid and life/movielike, I can remember them long after waking up. Sometimes they deal with topics that give me anxiety, which leads to me being anxious the whole day.\n\nI suffer from GAD/minor depression and I've been on meds for that for 1 1/2 years now. One of the side effects of the medication I originally got is \"unusual dreams\", and I switched to another one a few days ago, however this one has the same side effect. \n\nI'm not sure if the dreams are caused by my meds, DAE have experienced the same thing? I'm grateful for ANY insight and help, I'm feeling really desperate and I just want a good nights sleep again...\n\nEdit: Forgot to mention that i have them almost every night. ",

I was shaking in the car, I was so nervous in the waiting room that I had to leave the room and pace around the hall.  \nThen I got in to see the doc. We talked and I was still scared. So scared I couldn't even sit down, I had to stand and pace around.  \n  \nThen I went again 2 weeks later. This time I was more calm in the car, still a bit nervous. Then I sat and stayed in the waiting room (still anxious and wanting to leave the room but didn't). Then while in the doc's office I managed to get myself to sit down and be calm. It was great!  \n  \nThen yesterday I managed to get myself to leave the house and go to 3 stores! Sure I was scared, but I managed to get myself to leave my comfort zone and have fun while shopping!  \n  \nI don't mean to gloat or show off.  \nI really feel like my psychologist visits are working and encourage anyone with anxiety to visit one!",

I even took 2 weeks off just to try and focus on myself and that didn't help either was still having 2 bad panic attacks per day. Finally the one thing that finally started to improve things was meditation. \n\nTurns out meditation has been scientifically studied to help people with anxiety and depression, yet people are not exactly sure how. For me, i've just been popping in my headphones and youtube \"meditation\" choosing whatever length of time I want. \n\nThese two youtube videos have helped a lot:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vx8iUvfyCY\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6vO1wPAmiMQ\n\nNow that i've started meditating the other techniques i've been trying (exercise, journaling, CBT, etc) seem to help more than before too.

            "selftext": "I've been dealing with anxiety attacks on and off for about twelve years.  I'll have long stretches where all's well, then have a bad couple of weeks.  In retrospect, I have noticed my bouts of anxiety occurred most often when I was under stress in my life.  Bad marriage, bad girlfriend, unemployment, so on.  Most recently, my anxiety has been related to sleep.  \n\nI started a new job at the end of last summer that required a radical shift in my sleep patterns.  It's mostly been ok, with the occasional bout of sleeplessness.  Abut ten days ago, I woke up around 0100 because I had to pee (a regular occurrence), but found myself unable to get back to sleep.  A generally un-pleasant 4 hours were spent flipping and flopping, trying in vain to get my mind to let me go back to sleep.  No such luck, so I spent my 12 hour shift in Zombie Mode, mechanically doing my job.  Fast forward to the next night, and I woke up to pee again, as usual.  When I lay back down, I was starting to relax, when I thought, \"Oh man, wouldn't it be terrible if I couldn't get back to sleep?\"  This triggered an anxiety response which kept me up again.  For a few days this pattern slowly diminished, until I felt confident in my sleeping abilities again.\n\nAnother component of this I should mention is my reading habits.  Every night before bed, I read for an hour or so.  It's my sleep ritual, and it serves to relax me.  I've been doing it so long, I find myself unable to sleep unless I read.  For more than two years, I 've used a Kindle Fire to do this.  I love my Kindle, so much that its use has become to some small extent, a part of my identity.  Over the last week, however, I've been reading physical books, because I found an author  I like a lot at a garage sale (Michael Connelly, if you're interested) and bought a bunch of his books.  Well, I finished those, and I'm back to my trusty Kindle.  Trouble is, I've only recently been exposed to the idea that using Kindles and other screen devices before bed diminishes the quality of your sleep.\n\nSo, last night I lay down to read before bed, and I was stricken with the idea that maybe it was my Kindle that was causing the trouble.  This, of course triggered an anxiety response, which kept me awake.  I took a Xanax, but because I've been having trouble lately, I've taken three or four over the past three weeks (FAR above my usual consumption), and I find their effectiveness diminished.  So I tossed and turned more than half the night, finally dropping into a fitful sleep around midnight.\n\nThe worst part is that I KNOW I'm doing this to myself.  I've used my Kindle before bed every night for two years, and never had any trouble.  Even my initial bout of sleeplessness was caused by my own brain twisting itself up into a tizzy.  But, as I'm sure many of you are familiar with, knowing the source of the problem isn't enough to treat it.\n\nI'm not sure what I'm looking for by posting this.  Maybe I just needed to rant.  But if any of you have experienced something similar, I'd be glad to hear what happened to you.\n\ntl;dr Can't sleep because I have anxiety about experiencing insomnia.",

            "selftext": "Hi guys. Going to try some vitamin supplements to see what improvements may occur.\n\nSpecifically for anxiety I'm going to try a Magnesium supplement. It will be the Floradix Liquid Magnesium because I hate tablets personally. I will try different times to take it, as I hear magnesium before bed helps sleep, though taking in the morning/day might help me feel the benefits throughout the day.\n\nI will also be trying Floradix Liquid Iron and Vitamin Formula; in the hopes to aid my issues with fatigue. I think most of my fatigue comes because of anxiety, as it can really tire you out. It contains Iron, Vitamin B2,B6, B12, and C which are all supposed to aid reduction of fatigue.\n\nI'm going to make this a semi experiment and will update here as I progress - maybe it will help others!\n\nSupplements arriving today, will let you know my first thoughts soon.\n\n**EDIT**\n\n*Results*\n\nDAY 1\nMagnesium 250mg - Took before getting into bed, fell asleep within half an hour (usually 1+), though highly likely influenced by poor sleep the night previous and busy day) The morning after I felt pretty refreshed, but quite dopey and have felt this way the day so far. Again it may be tiredness generally, but anxious? Barely at all today, except right now a tad, no matter where my thoughts go my anxiety level is normal.\n\n[Floradix Liquid Iron &amp; Vit formula; C, thiamin, riboflavin, B6, B12, iron](http://www.salusuk.com/products/floradix.html) - Taken my AM dosage, haven't yet noticed much change but may take a few days doses to see difference. After saying this my stomach got really painful and irritated, I think because of the iron, so the pain invoked anxiety massively. Maybe just need to be smarter with taking it closer to eating times.\n\nDAY 2\nAfter yesterdays stomach cramps from the Iron supplement, I decided to stop taking it, just couldn't handle it yesterday.\nAlso, after taking magnesium for the second day in a row, this brought on some horrible side effects which invoked my anxiety massively and gave me serious worrying problems in my stomach, chest, and brain fog, etc etc.\n\nSo unfortunately I went to the A&amp;E/ER after speaking on the phone to a health line that advised me to do so.\nI had an ECG and a blood test. I had an electrolyte spike in my heart rate because of the unnecessary magnesium in my system, but the bloods came back fine so I was safe to go home and just rest it off.\n\nI feel much better today after a day of resting and its pretty much out of my system now. But **LESSON LEARNT: Consult your GP/doctor before attempting supplements, you might just end up overtaking what you do not need and causing yourself more problems.**\n\nSoon I will go to my doctor to get the OK to take vitamin D, which is something I have had bloods for as being deficient in. I am only just discovering its connection with anxiety/depression and other similar issues i have had.\n\nI am *no longer* going to start trying different supplements to see what works unless its naturally through my foods, which greatly dilutes the effects and side effects. END OF THREAD. Until I begin Vit D supplement.",

I can't help but worry about and over-analyze every little situation that I find myself in. \n\nEven the smallest things cause complete and utter dread and emotional despair to me, such as my boyfriend not responding to a text, or the thought that I may not be able to sleep at night. These things will weigh on me the entire day. Nothing helps. I feel okay for an hour, and the next I feel as though my life is falling apart and nothing will ever be ok. If I'm sleeping alone, I will almost always wake up in a complete panic with an ache on my whole body. I dread checking my phone in fear that nobody wants to talk to me or cares at all.\n\nI'm entirely aware of how dramatic this sounds, but I can't live like this anymore. I feel scared of this feeling all times of the day. Please, if anyone has any relation or ideas of how I can better cope with this, I would really appreciate the input.",

I've also had this constant bouts of intermittent diarrhea/constipation. I've been feeling tired all the time and taking 4-hour naps in the middle of the day even when I get full night sleep. \n\nYesterday I went to the doctor because I really thought I had a stomach ulcer or a serious physical condition that was bringing me to tears of pain almost every day, and it turns out my stomach, pancreas, and all other GI organs are intact. My doctor told me that my symptoms are greatly due to all the stress I go through (I'm a medical student) and to my anxiety and depression which affects me physically and exacerbates my symptoms. She recommended a diet that will help and ways to manage my stress in order to feel more energized and take my mind off the things that might be causing me these symptoms (I'm already on medication but to be honest, it's still stressful ass h---.) \n\nTo be honest I started crying and was a little cathartic when receiving the news because it's hard to know that not only does my anxiety affect my daily life in terms of what I get to do and the courage I get to build up to do the simplest things: phone calls, texts, random visits, asking for things, etc, but that know it's also taking a toll on my body to the point that it's making me not just mentally, but also physically impaired. \n\nI know it'd be disgraceful to say \"I wish it had been al ulcer\", but man, it's just really frustrating to know your own mind is playing those games on you. I'm really looking forward to changing these lifestyle choices my doctor told me about and see how everything goes because I have a long journey to go and I can't afford to be feeling sick all the time.",

I quickly realized after leaving my feet in for a minute that it was way way too hot. \nThe lady came back over and asked about the temperature again, possibly noticing my discomfort, and being the nervous idiot I am I told her it was fine! I don't know why it was so difficult for me to ask her to turn the temperature down.\nWhen she took my feet out of the water to work on them, they were bright red, numb and tingly. There were also some small blisters on the bottoms of my feet. I think she noticed but didn't say anything. Walking out of the salon was so painful.

            "selftext": "Hey r/anxiety,\n\nNow a month ago I was in class I had my firsr ever panic attack. My right side went numb (Not a stroke), I got really dizzy, I told myself I was going to die, uncomfortable and depersonilization. I went to my family doctors and the childrens hospital of Ottawa where the performed a neurological exam and did some extensive question.\n\nThe weeks following I non-stopped worried it could be a brain tumor because my dad had one at my age. Even though I told the doctors about my worries and they assured me it wasn't.\n\nI developed insomnia and worried 24/7 I had a brain tumor. I had some symptoms that came and went and some that stayed . \nI constantly even to this day feel like I'm in a dream and I had some really bad dizzyness.\n\nEventually I accepted last week that if this was a brain tumor I would've probably passed out or had a seizure by now.\n\nI've met some incredible people on my journey who will continue to be my friends :).\n\nI've started feeling better and believing my friends, family, doctors and therapist and accept is just some bad anxiety, mild depression and acute stress disorder.\n\nAnyways just wanted you guys to know how I'm doing. One day anxiety will be a thing of the past and we'll live our lives out with a blast :)",

I'm giving it to you guys for free because some of you really need it.\n\n* Positive Affirmations\n* Meditation\n* listening to either calming music or dance music\n* Just dancing and letting the body go (helps stay in the present m moment)\n* Exercise/Yoga\n* Go to sleep early/don't eat at least 2 hrs before you go to sleep\n* Drink cold,refreshing water\n* Write (short story, poetry)\n* Read a favorite book\n* Learn about a new topic\n* Do some gardening, play with pets\n* Have a routine in the morning (drink tea, read news, etc)\n* Eat healthy (make a delicious smoothie)\n* Pamper yourself (face mask, new haircut, doing nails)\n* Make yourself laugh by watching comedy\n* Go outside, look at nature, feel the sun on your body\n* Think about what you're grateful for\n* Talk to somebody about their day \n* Involve yourself deeply in something\n* Volunteer\n* Rely in your faith, either religious or spiritual to anchor you. \n\n* Stay outside and busy, in the midst of people. For most people, anxiety happens when they are alone and have nothing to do. Staying outside instead of holing up in your room and doing the computer.  Experience life!\n\n* When you do get anxious, have a certain step plan to get yourself out of it (rationalizing, staying calm by breathing deeply, counting, taking it one step at a time)\n\nStay away from the things that cause you anxiety. For me, I have debilitating health anxiety, so I stay away from the computer. I try to stay in a positive mental space so I don't have recurring negative thought loops. \n\n* Know that you're going to have good days and bad days. It isn't always good. If you do have bad days, figure out a plan to get yourself out of that negative thinking and start again in a positive mental space.",

I don't think I'll be sleeping tonight.\n\n\n*********Edit: Thanks for the love support and advice everyone! I talked to the chair and he told me that he can't just write me into the class even if I brought my own computer because it is a \"physical limitation of the space.\"  I couldn't get a straight answer out of him, but we eventually settled with \"He will try his hardest to get me into the class, but it is going to take some time and a lot of work.\"",
