So I come up with a limerick that reads:\n\nI came for the quiz and nothing more,\nAmazed to see you when I came through the door,\nI write this shit rhyme,\nWith the hope of getting your time,\nAnd hopefully maybe i'll score.\n(then a wink face and my number)\n\nQuite happy with that, thought it's a bit cheeky and it really is my style (would love feedback on the limerick haha)\n\nI handed this to her when her shift finished in front of all her friends, I said \"I think you've dropped something,\" Smiled and went before she read it. Had nothing on my phone so I'm pretty sure it's a no.\n\nEven though I'm 99% sure she rejected me I'm really quite happy! I did something that really worried and scared me, especially because it was in front of  5 of her friends. \n\nI just wanted to share this because I'm proud and I hope it can show people that it's worth trying even if you get rejected!\n\n:-)",

A fairly long trip in a car (45 minutes as a passenger, but still very panic inducing on the freeway) and four hours with friends. Around midway through it hit me like a wall. I was well rested but suddenly could barely keep my eyes open and felt like I had to lay down. I made it through the social event and survived the car trip home, but the rest of the afternoon/night I was like a zombie. Its not even tiredness, its worse than tiredness, its feeling utterly demolished. Like you can barely get the energy to get up and eat.\n\nI'm unemployed at the moment (largely thanks to the anxiety) but I don't know how people make it through a work day like this.

I was medicated for a year which worked pretty well, but I personally just don't view meds as a permanent option.\n\nI started Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) about 7 months ago, and it is changing my life. For those who don't know what CBT is, essentially it's a form of therapy that treats mental disorders holistically by looking at your thought patterns and learning to challenge your cognitions. The idea is that there is a feedback loop between your thoughts, your emotions (anxiety, sadness, obsession, etc) and your behavior, and if you're able to alter your interpretation of your thoughts then you can alter how you feel. \n\nAs an engineer and an analytical thinker, I was fairly skeptical about this approach. I was under the assumption that your cognitions are deeply embedded in your DNA and could not be altered. Well after 7 months of learning about all of my subconscious self-critical / self-esteem killing / perfectionism / judgmental thoughts and learned how to challenge those thoughts, I can tell you that it does work, and it works really well. It doesn't happen overnight, and it's not always easy, but please if you are struggling in any way with anxiety / depression, try out CBT. I've been down the road of panic attacks, self-doubt, self-criticism, hopelessness, and the scariest of all: suicidal thoughts, and I know how much it fucking sucks. Believe me, I do. But I also know that there is always hope, and there is always help. We're not alone, and I hope this reaches somebody in need.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

This last semester of school I was so happy, wasn't taking my Xanax, had only like 3-4 panic attacks, was getting good grades, wasn't fighting with SO, hit my high weight of 115 (I'm 5'8 and 115 was a dream for me)\n\nThen summer happened. I'm doing that gasping thing all day everyday. If I'm not with my SO, I won't sleep until 3 and I'll wake up at 7-8. I've already lost like 4-5 pounds. Sometimes I will go 2-3 days not even realizing I haven't eaten. I won't notice until I get light headed whenever I stand or cramps because my stomach is so tight. Even when my stomach tightens, I feel nothing when I look at food.\n\nNothing is appealing. The more anxious I am the less I eat, the more anxious I am. I try to shove stuff down but I have a hard time swallowing.\n\nI miss being heavier. when I was like 18, I was like 125. I felt so healthy and looooved my body. I hate it now. I miss my boobs.

However, today I was on the tram and suddenly out of nowhere the nausea starts up again... I'm in between stops and I don't have anything in my work bag that might help. I try to hold it down and manage to succeed for about 15 seconds but them my stomach contracts hard and out it comes all over my lap, workbag, and the seating either side of me.\n\nLuckily there were ladies near me that were nice enough to give me some tissues and wet wipes to get cleaned up, nonetheless it felt absolutely horrible and I'm still mortified... All I could do is sit there sweating and wiping my mess up (sounds like the end of a porno, unfortunately the reality is far from it)... the combination of throwing up, the humidity, and anxiety made me sweat like a talking muffin in an oven.\n\nThanks anxiety, way to give me my most embarrassing moment ever, even worse than trying to kiss my teacher in the 5th grade.  \n\nI gotta do something about this shit but psychs and psych meds are too expensive here, and the ones I used in the past didn't help at all (lexapro and pristiq). Shelling out $1000 USD a month for something that never helped just doesn't seem to make sense. \n\nAm feeling a bit trapped and I have no idea what to do to beat this shit. It seems like the only thing that helps is rest. I don't really get panic attacks per se, so breathing techniques don't seem to help, nor does anything else I've tried such as meditation. Unfortunately, life is life and I need to work everyday, so rest isn't really possible most of the time.\n\nI don't really have a question or anything, I just needed to get what happened today off my chest. If anyone has any advice it is very welcome. Thanks for letting me vent. ",

I cry, get dizzy, shake, the whole deal. It's been getting better, but slowly.\n\nToday I went in for my physical, and my doctor told me we needed to do a routine blood test. I wasn't expecting it, and I was by myself (whenever I need to get blood drawn I bring someone with me). But I went down to the lab, told the technician about my anxiety, and got through it. The tech was really nice, too; he kept telling me I was doing great and there was nothing to worry about. I cried a little, but not much, and I walked out of that office feeling like a superhero.

This time I got staph infection and while the big spot is going away (almost completely gone) due to the antibiotics I was on, I noticed two lumps that formed under my skin on both my wrists. I don't know if that could be staph or not, they feel like cysts maybe? They aren't sore. But this is the main source of my anxiety right now. Thinking I have staph and that I'm going to die from it somehow. Or that I have something worse. I could have a headache and think I'm having an aneurysm. I literally lay in bed all day because my anxiety is too bad to be able to function. Sometimes I get such bad panic attacks while I'm driving that I have to pull over. They wake me up out of a dead sleep so I haven't been sleeping good either. I also get nausea from my anxiety so I don't eat good, either. The only time I feel okay is when I take about 4 mg of Xanax, then I feel so normal and comfortable and able to function. That may seem like a high dose but I have developed a tolerance. The only thing is, I run out so fast because I only get 30 a month. I'm going to talk to my doctor about bumping my script up. Also I make sure not to take them daily so I don't become physically dependent on them because I know the withdrawal from that is a bitch and dangerous. I'm on 2 mg of Abilify too which I feel does nothing. I just feel like I'm going to die any day now. Ugh at this point I'm just rambling, I just had to get all this off my chest. My friend said go to the doctor and tell him everything you think is wrong and you'll feel better but I'm too anxious to even do that... thanks for reading. ",

            "selftext": "I don't agree with the way people are told to handle their anxiety.  To simply \"think positive\" and push away any negative/anxiety-inducing thoughts.  To me, that translates to ignoring the negative thoughts regardless of how rational they may be.  It's making them go away temporarily, to deal with at a later time, but not truly *solving* them or eliminating them entirely.\n\nOftentimes, whatever's causing the negative thoughts are outside of your control.  Many people will tell you to not worry about what you can't control, but my gut reaction is to think \"The only reason you can't control these things is because you *believe* that you can't.  You can't control them if you don't even try to.\"  I realize it *isn't* very likely you'll be able to control certain events even if you do try.  But to me, it's like having a 1% chance of being able to control something if you try to control it, and a 0% chance if you don't.  That 1% is important to me.\n\nI hold onto negative thoughts in the hopes that by reflecting on them, I'll somehow figure out a way to eliminate the root cause of those thoughts.  If I merely push them out of my mind, I'm allowing them to haunt me at a later date, and to haunt other people as well.  Pushing them out of my mind makes them go away, but it isn't a *solution*.  Anything less than a solution is unacceptable to me.",
