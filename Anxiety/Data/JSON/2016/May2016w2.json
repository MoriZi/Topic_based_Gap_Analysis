            "selftext": "I live in a non medical marijuana state. I was able to obtain 250 mg while traveling to Colorado of RX Releaf high CBD pediatric whole plant extract tincture.  \nI was a longtime pot smoker but quit 3 years ago bc it started to increase my anxiety BIG TIME for the first 3 hours, the benefits to sleep and appetite were still there but the anxiety at first became overwhelming. I continued to try it once a year with the same effect. Extreme anxiety, freaking out, slight paranoia, &amp; just..worrying about all my problems. I thought my days of cannabis use were over.  \nI began to read about CBD, its positive effect for epilepsy in children, anxiety, &amp; depression. I read about how THC is the \"high\" in weed &amp; *can* create anxiety in some ppl. Weed has been bred for high THC on the black market but breeders are beginning to grow CBD rich plants bc of the positive medicinal properties.  \nI tried it today. 8 drops. It works! It's like I took a xanax except I'm not sleepy, I don't \"feel\" it, I don't feel high in the slightest, nothing. There is *almost* no THC. I feel calm, collected, organized, very clear headed. This stuff works for me! I haven't tested it over time but we'll see. I may be traveling to Colorado more until it's legal here, it almost is. A bill almost passed this year &amp; I'm sure it will in the future. 75% of my state approves of medicinal MJ.  \nI encourage anyone with anxiety to try it. You do not get high &amp; it has completely eliminated my anxiety, at least for today. It is a miracle. I'm not some big pro weed fixes everything type. This stuff is amazing! I feel hope. HOPE. I'm even smiling, Un.Be.Liev.Able. I'm not exaggerating, I've had an anxiety disorder for as long as I can remember, diagnosed by top psychiatrists. Only benzos work but they are extremely addicting &amp; tolerance builds fast. It feels like I took 2, klonopin without the...fog, sedation.. Incredible.   \nhttp://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24923339. \n  \nEdit: please forgive me on the title, I was excited, ok? This is what's great: No smoke, no lung issues, it's NOT addictive, &amp; I'm not stoned! I can drive!....but not write, I am happy, it's insane.  \nEdit2: I don't want to be giving out wrong info &amp; I just noticed, it actually has a ratio of 13:1 CBD to THC. There is in fact a miniscule  amount of THC in this product. ",

My Mum then asks why he had an erection, he tells Mum that I was sitting on his lap. She then starts to get jealous and asks what was wrong with her, and they have a small argument before she walks inside, leaving me alone with him. He then asks me to come towards him, with a very deivant expression, I suddenly felt anxious, and say no before running inside and going to my bedroom. He then follows me inside, and enters my bedroom. My Mum and myself yell at him to leave me alone, him and Mum have another small argument before he drives off. Mum then comes into my bedroom later to tell me not to tell anyone about what happened, because people will come to take me away.\n\nThen, when I was about 11/12 he would enter the bathroom while I was showering everyday, even though I expressed to him that I wanted my privacy many times. I asked him to stop, I asked my Mum to talk to him. The bathroom door would be closed (no lock), but he would still come in. His reasons for entering would change, sometimes it was to wash his hands, to check his face in the mirror (which was located directly in front of the mirror), or to just have a chat because he hadn't seen me all day. I would complain to my Mum everyday, and she would just say she would talk to him, or even said that I always showered while he was home so I must want him to look at me.\n\nThese memories have been causing me a great deal of stress, but I'm confused about if they're serious, and if I should be worried about them?\nI have two young daughters myself now, and I'm worried about their safety around my parents.\nAm I overreacting or do I have something to worry about?",

These are the things I've been doing recently to stop a panic attack before it swallows me and to pull myself out if it already has:\n\nDO's:\n\n1. Read. Literally read anything. Out loud. No books around? Read the boxes of products you have laying around. Read the posters in your classroom. Before you know it, you're a bit calmer.\n\n2. Play a relaxing android/iOS game. My favorite is Hay Day. Collect eggs from your chickens. Sell your products to other players. Join a neighborhood. Strive to unlock that new piece of equipment! Eventually you'll be lost in the game trying to make more cash and unlock fun things. (Also a bonus, there is NO need to buy anything with real money here.) Another favorite is Plague Inc. It really makes you think.\n\n3. Play with your pet. Grab a toy and play tug of war with your dog. Shake a laser point across the room and watch your cat go wild. Put your hamster in a ball and witness his joy as he runs amuck. Don't have a pet? I would definitely recommend one. Dogs know when you're upset and will try to comfort you. My dog actually has anxiety as well and starts shaking when I'm upset. So a lot of the time I have to tell myself \"Deanna, you're stressing the dog out, get a grip!\". And cats? There purring is super calming.\n\n4. Go outside and put your bare feet in the sand. Its called earthing, I believe and has its benefits. Look it up. Draw in the sand while doing so. Dig a small hole. Listen to the birds and all the nature around you.\n\n5. Put on a funny show or even a cartoon. My favorites are impractical jokers, the carbanaro effect, and spongebob. Its hard to be upset when you see jokers running around making you laugh.\n\n6. Solve basic math problems. What's 9 x 14? What's 27 \u00f7 3? Etc. \n\n7. Talk to yourself. Tell yourself you are fine and that you are acting ridiculous over nothing. Sometimes you have to be a little harsh to get the point across.\n\nI have tons more and may post them another time. If you have tips feel free to suggest them. I just see so many people on several different reddits asking how to cope and how to help their bf/gfbget out of them. Maybe we need a huge list compiled of our personal tips since not everything works for every person. Unless we already have that? I'm pretty new here. Hah.",

My anxiety is through the roof, I can't sit down and I have work. It's currently 4am in Australia, I also have emetophobia and heard my neighbour being sick as I got home. This night cannot get any worse. \n\nSo please, if you deal with anxiety, depression or any sort of mental illness do not be pressured into drugs or do it in a safe environment with close friends. These symptoms will double and make it impossible to relax. \nIf anyone can reassure me that I'll be fine, it would help so much, I've never done drugs before.\n\nEDIT: I thought I might make a little update to anyone who might be interested in the come down state I experienced. It is about 19 hours later since I took the pill. I definitely felt like shit today and didn't sleep until about 9am up until 12pm, then I had to get ready for work. I woke up quite depressed and in a mental state I haven't been in for a long time, running on no sleep and dealing with last night I guess kinda of hit me. I had quite a loss of appetite, however I ate a bowl of fruit like u/tragicfucker recommended and felt a bit better. As the night went on, I started to become more tired then I was depressed which definitely was a better feeling than the latter. Thank you guys for all your reassurance and stories, I read every single one and it was helping me so much while I was peeking this morning. ",

I was in weekly therapy almost continuously. The last 2 years I was also attending a weekly group therapy on top of individual counseling. It was constant med switches until finally they found something that worked (but not before I got all looped out on Prozac and failed Bio 311). I had a breakdown almost every semester: nonstop crying, unable to breathe, oxygen hunger all over the fucking place, eating disorders everywhere, crippling fear. Twice I locked myself in my apartment, nailed blankets over the windows and didn\u2019t come out for several days.\n\nBut most of the time, it was just that intractable, uncomfortable, buzzing haze of anxiety. My constant study-buddy.\n\nThis past semester I got introduced to the wonders of domestic violence, and I had to be escorted from my former home by the cops. I lost everything and I was living in some kind of shelter with *roommates* and I have HORRIBLE social anxiety and my room used to be my safe space\u2014and worst of all, they didn\u2019t allow pets, so I had to leave my dogs with a kennel. My dogs were more supportive to me than therapy or meds combined. Having everything taken away so brutally was the worst experience of my life.\n\nBut now at least I have my Bachelor of Science. I have no idea how it happened. Every single day I wanted to quit, I fucking failed over and over, but I *wanted* my degree. I know it\u2019s just a piece of paper that most people earn in 4 years (I have a friend who got hers in 3), it doesn\u2019t guarantee me some great future, and I know my 2.8 GPA is *hardly* something to brag about\u2014all of this stuff is so embarrassing to talk about with my \u201cnormal\u201d friends who all have &gt;3.0 GPAs and are finishing on time.\n\nBut I just wanted to tell someone who knows what it means to fight anxiety, because we all have to do it every single day and for once, I have something to show for it. I\u2019ve quit and failed almost everything else\u2014relationships, jobs, broken dreams I used to have before anxiety grabbed me like a chimp and ripped my face off.\n\nNow I know that my anxiety *will not* stop me, and therapy and medication *do* help sometimes, when you find the right combination. These are two things that I was never convinced of throughout this whole process. I seriously just had to keep trying somehow. It was never pretty. In fact most of the time it was horrendous. But I think it was worth it.\n\nTL;DR: I graduated college.",

Although I dont see her any differently at all and wont treat her any differently at all, im just wondering if there any behaviors i should be letting slide of encouraging for now onwards, \nfor example, she is often scared to choose somewhere for us to go on a date, or to order food etc, should I be encouraging her to step out of her shell in these situations of should I ease her anxiety by doing these things for her?\nI'm sure there are countless other questions I could ask but this is a big one sticking out for me.

We once briefly had a conversation about how she's feeling, and I think she may have some serious anxiety issues. \n\nShe takes a very long time to reply to messages, she never initiates anything on her own, she is always worrying about being an inconvenience to me, she brushes off compliments I give her, she will often put herself last unless I explicitly invite her to join (for example, she came over to my friends house and we were all going to watch a movie. The couch was crowded and she offered to stand... Alone... So we made room and she sat beside me after a few prompts). She once even said that I was \"intimidating\", even though I feel like I've been extremely gentle and patient. Normally, these would all be signs that the relationship is failing and I would just start dating someone else, but she seems to really like me (and she's even said that she does), especially since we continue to see each other. \n\nHow should I go about letting her know that I care? How can I approach the situation without causing any further stress? She's a really cool person and I'd like to keep the relationship going. I used to have really severe panic attacks as a kid, so I know how it goes, but I never get them anymore. (I now haven't had a panic attack over 6 years.)

First panic attack at 12, and ever since I've been a part of this adventure we call mental illness. I've been on and off medication since I was 20 years old, I'm now 25. The past year and a half I was off all meds and my panic seemed to be in remission. I experienced life WITHOUT anxiety for a whole year! Depression was still there but I will take what I can get haha.\n\nTwo weeks ago I suffered a massive anxiety attack out of absolutely no where. I've learned how bad things can get in the past, so I made an appointment with my psychiatrist immediately. Today was our first meeting and I'm back on my regimen of Zoloft/Xanax. I don't view it as a step back, I view at it treating a chronic illness that has flared up again. I'm nipping this bullshit in the bud before I end up in a dark place. \n\nNo point to this really, other than I'm really excited and happy that I've learned from mistakes in the past. I'm hoping for good things, which is something I haven't done for a long time. \n\nEDIT: I realize my username is confusing but I am female, lol. Thank you all :) ",
