            "selftext": "YAY I did it!\n\nI had to leave my other job recently because the work environment was just too awful. I decided I wanted to join a startup or something where I could be less of a cog in the machine and have more impact with my work.\n\nA few days after I started looking for jobs this startup contacted me and I did a preliminary interview, and saturday was my technical interview.\n\nIt was a long ass interview, I was there from 10 to 4:30. Like the title says, I almost didn't go because I was too nervous. I ended up pushing through and got there. Jumped into the technical stuff and admittedly I fucked up a few things (I forgot what a closure does in Javascript, for example), and the interviewer told me this was the case during the interview. I was pretty sure I didn't get the job, but I just explained how I was nervous and kept going with the interview. I focused on showing my thought processes rather than my hard skills in the problems because my anxiety makes me blank on the details under pressure. \n\nI got the offer the same day. They told me that my interview skills were very unconventional but awesome, which is huge for me because I have been trying to improve my interview for a long time.\n\nEven if you think you're fucking up, or feel too nervous to do something, just give it a try. You might surprise yourself! \nThanks for reading, just had to share :)\n\nEdit: thanks for all the love this is probably the best community on Reddit lol\n",

            "selftext": "I am a person who has anxiety. I was reminded of this today when I was reading a legal document and by the end I felt nauseous. I realized this is because while I was reading through each of the stipulations, I was creating outliers in my mind of far-fetched, hypothetical situations in which I could be legally culpable of doing the wrong thing.\n\nThe thing about anxiety is that it\u2019s progressive. So as soon as I have these little \u201cwhat if I do something wrong one day\u201d worries I remember that overall in my life I am also worried about how much my credit card bill is going to be for December since I can\u2019t remember which gifts I put on it and whether my doctor is going to renew my prescription without me having to go in and see him like I said I would last time he renewed it and that I still haven\u2019t painted over the place in my wall where I moved a chair and scratched up the paint. Anxiety is an exhausting thing to have.\n\nWhat should be obvious, but never is, to anxiety sufferers is that you don\u2019t have to fix your life all at once. We have to learn to sever the connections between all the things we\u2019re nervous about.\n\nI think it\u2019s the natural conclusion of anxiety-thoughts that you have to figure out a solution RIGHT now. I know i\u2019ve gotten out of bed enough times at 3am to make a list of things I\u2019m going to do in order to assuage my anxiety just enough to sleep to know that planning and fixing is really the only that that helps halt anxiety symptoms. So we assume that we have anxiety because we need to fix stuff.\n\n\u201cIf only I could figure out my life, I wouldn\u2019t be dealing with these thoughts.\u201d\n\nUnfortunately, the thoughts won\u2019t go away, you\u2019ll just find something else to fixate on. For instance, I generally have anxiety about money topics. There\u2019s no rhyme or reason to it, it just happens to be my biggest trigger. My friend who is unemployed currently, has a much bigger reason than I do to have money-related anxiety, yet what she fixates on is how people perceive her. Yet another friend with anxiety constantly struggles with thinking she is doing a terrible job at her work, where her bosses seem to love her in reality. None of our anxieties are tied to a real life problem, just to a perceived inadequacy. Fixing each individual problem won\u2019t make our internal process of perceiving inadequacy go away. When you cut off one head of the beast, it simply grows another.\n\nThis is why it is liberating to say \u201cI don\u2019t have to fix my life.\u201d Some part of our lives, by nature of being human, will always be imperfect. Chasing perfection is a red herring, it distracts us from the real goal, which is to figure out how to be happy in the midst of imperfection. Fixing your problems is unrelated to happiness. Do whatever it takes to internalize this reality. I\u2019m doing that, and I hope, eventually it will be so internalized my anxiety will have no choice but to listen. ",

Having anxiety already sucks, but being a black girl, I just feel really alone. None of my black friends acknowledge this kind of thing. I don't know ANY other black people that suffer from this shit. I've opened up to close friends about it, and being mainly Christians, they say \"oh just pray about it\". \n\nI would love if some other redditors of color would comment on their experience on whether their race or culture effects them having anxiety/a mental illness. Especially black men. It would just be awesome to hear about your experiences and know that I'm not alone out here. Thanks \ud83d\udc9b",

            "selftext": "Hey folks! Last I was on reddit I posted saying I finally took myself to the hospital for suicidal and homicidal thoughts as well as no appetite, what I thought were from the Zoloft I started 4 weeks prior. I had moderate - severe anxiety since July but nothing like this and never suicidal thoughts. Anyways I wanted to kind of go over what it was like with everyone here since I imagine many of you are very afraid of mental hospitals like I was.\n\n**The Process:**\n\nThis part may vary at different hospitals but this is how it went for me. I drove to the ER at 11:30am Saturday. They did some basic vitals, took all my belongings and locked them in a safe, and had me sit on a bed in the hallway. I saw a doctor and told him what was going on, and he didn't think I was in immediate danger so he told me to wait there until the psych lady came down. 6 hours of sitting on the bed, watching someone almost die in the room next to me, and the security guard giving me weird looks, the psych triage lady came to see me. \n\nShe talked with me, and offered me a choice of just going home, going to an outpatient program, or going to an inpatient facility. Since I was so scared I'd act on these thoughts I opted for inpatient hospitalization. She told me their current population was more drug related so she found me a facility an hour away that had more people like me and another 5 hours later (11:40pm) the ambulance was ready to take me. This was the only scary part because they wrapped me in two blankets and strapped me onto the stretcher (belt at the calves, thighs, then a 4 point harness on my chest) but the EMT's were super cool and knew I wouldn't try to hurt them so I could move and stuff. I wish I got their names because they were probably the nicest two people I have met in a while. An hour and a half ride later and I was there. Also I smelled like BO from the hot ambulance.\n\nIt was sometime passed midnight at this point so the facility was quiet, security wheeled me in and I met with two guys who took my vitals, gave me the clothes and items I was allowed to have, then took me to the doctor. I met with the weekend doctor, she wasn't very good, she was from another country and had a thick accent and didn't really have any emotions but she was a little funny toward the end. The nurse was really nice and showed me to my room (more on that later) and I tried to sleep. I was having a lot of anxiety so I went to the med station to get an Ativan, but while I was waiting I had a panic attack and she took me to the quite room that had flowers on the walls and a bathroom in it. Started dry heaving, then got my Ativan, and went to bed somewhere around 2am Sunday morning. \n\n**The Mental Hospital:**\n\nAh yes the real reason you read this. It was...pretty nice actually. I shared a room with another guy though it was a co-ed wing. He was cool didn't talk much. We each had a bed, night stand, light, and a chair. We also had a shared bathroom with the room next to us. The first day I wasn't allowed to have shoelaces but I got those the second day, as well as privileges to go outside 3 times a day with other patients for a walk in the court yard (beautiful trees and plants and what not). Items I wasn't allowed were my hairspray, hair gel, cologne, gum, metal can of walnuts, comb, and hat. I was allowed to have towels, soap, toothbrush, deodorant, books, magazines, pens, and a notebook. Cell phones and computers were strictly prohibited. \n\nThe wing had a common room (board games, puzzles, and a TV lounge), showers, dining hall, nursing offices, and 2 phones. The staff was my favorite part. My doctor/psychiatrist and case worker were kind of stern which I didn't like but the nurses and techs were amazing. They played games with us and I talked to tons of them about current events and stuff. The patients were also really good people, all ages, dealing with all sorts of things, but all of them very nice. I met a lot of people I will never forget and since people didn't stay there very long I didn't get to say goodbye to some of them before they left. \n\n**My Improvements:**\n\nI was there for a total of 3 days. In those 3 days they changed my medication to Effexor. I think it's working but it's too early to tell as I'm still coming off the Zoloft. Suicidal thoughts are gone but the homicidal ones are still there. Since there wasn't a ton to do I ended up thinking a lot, and I was constantly worried I would hurt someone or become some sort of criminal. They have definitely gotten better though. We had some group therapy but I didn't find that overly helpful because everyone had such different problems it was hard to relate/get skills from half of what the therapist taught us. Also like I said I wasn't a huge fan of my psych so I wasn't able to open up with her as much.\n\nWhat helped me the most was seeing other patients worse off than me improve drastically and the positive attitudes of the staff\n\n**Moving Forward:**\n\nSo now I'm home, my anxiety is still kind of bad but I'm eating again, and the racing thoughts about committing bad things have gone down a ton now that I can drive and go on reddit. I'm also having some headaches and brain zaps from Zoloft and I was super agitated when I got home.\n\nI start a 1 week outpatient day program tomorrow which I hope will work. I'm also going to work closely with my new psychologist and they found me a psychiatrist while I was there (literally impossible before) so that's cool. I'm kind of afraid to mention that the homicidal thoughts are still there but I don't even have a plan for them, just the worry of becoming a killer (I read the Colorado movie theater shooter was on Zoloft - that didn't help) because I feel like they will send me back, but probably not. I've literally never hurt a soul in my 20 years on this earth and all I am is nice to people. One time I stepped on a bug when I was little and cried for an hour - and I gave my roommate a game before I left so I can't be that bad of a guy right? \n\nAnyways that's my story! I hope this helps anyone who might feel the need to go to the hospital eventually. In my experience do it if you need to. The mental hospital was no where near as bad as I thought and tbh I probably didn't need to be there but it was a good safety measure. I have fond memories of the hospital now that it's all said and done. Hopefully it gets better from here! ",

            "selftext": "I'm posting this as someone with undiagnosed and recently discovered GAD. Though I'm undiagnosed, there is not a single doubt in my mind I have it after reading the symptoms. \n\nI've been searching online for months now trying to find ways of coping with it because I can't get counseling this semester (free on campus). \n\nBefore I realized I had GAD, I'd gotten a kitten for my birthday. A sweet little girl all black that had to suffer a five hour drive back to my hometown the day after being separated from her siblings. \n\nAt first, her being a kitten, she was torturing me and my anxiety. Kittens are demanding, and she upped my stress levels tenfold. She's also so reckless, and literally everytime I left her alone in my room to go to class I pictured her killing herself somehow and I'd have panic attacks all day. \n\nThat was nearly two months ago. Now, without it being super apparent, I've realized just how much she's helped me. Yes, that initial time raising her was torture, but now I would 100% classify her as a support animal. \n\nShe has helped in so many ways. Being worried 24/7 about her wellbeing has helped me practice reassuring myself. Before her, I NEEDED reassurance from SOMEONE else to calm down. I could tell myself the same thing as they would, but it wouldn't work. Now, it's easier for me to tell myself, \"Megan, she's fine. She's been fine for two months.\" and BELIEVE myself. \n\nShe got me over my fear of beginning to drive. We had a situation one day where I was scared she would die (throwing up and I'm a new kitten mom, got so scared) and I realized that day that despite my fear of driving, I NEEDED a car. I needed a way to get her to a vet without relying on anyone else. Obviously I'm still scared of driving, but she was the motivation to push me to start doing it. \n\nShe makes me less scared of isolation. I love to be alone, but usually it would lead to panic attacks because I was by myself and able to think. Now when I start thinking I play with my kitten, which is more than distracting enough. \n\nShe's still a handful, and still young, but I've noticed I'm no longer anxious about her, and about a few things in my life. My anxiety is nowhere near \"cured\" but she's helped significantly. Watching her grow, and raising her, has proven to me that I AM more responsible than I ever realized. \n\n**Edit:** Just wanted to add that she's proven to me that I can hold someone else's life in my hands and come out of it with BOTH of us better off (she's a sweet as sin kitten, my roommates are good at telling me I've done well with her), and therefore, I CAN take control of my own life and become better off as well. It'll just take me some time. \n\nObviously, this isn't advice that will work with everyone. It's just a suggestion for those interested that I've found has really helped me. ",

Even though I saw that it's pretty easy to get in (have a pulse, can life 70 lbs, can follow instructions) I was still anxious about the interview. \n\nTurns out there really wasn't even an interview. There was about 30 people of all shapes sizes and ages, the very nice and cheery girl told us the basic responsibilities and her story of how she started from our positions. She said she will be hiring 600 people this season so I think we all got hired on the spot basically. We filled out a form on which areas we wanted to work and info about us. She called a few people back at a time to an office which was the \"interview\" part. She made me write my social down and asked if I had any questions. I just told her my school schedule for the rest of the semester and she said that would be no issue at all and boom done. Didn't hurt that she went to the same school and subject as me! She said she will call in a couple days. \n\nI am super excited!",

            "selftext": "Does anyone else deal with this? How do you explain it to people who just DON'T get it?\n\nThe idea of calling some place like the doctor's office or a store causes so much anxiety. I don't mind calling a family member or a good friend, but anything else is too...unpredicable, I guess. I still ask my mom to make my hair appts and things like that (and I'm 29) and she does, because she's a super nice mom like that, not because she knows about my anxiety at all. \n\nI worked a summer job for a few years at a call centre. It was literally the worst. When I started at the company it was in a position that required zero phone calls, but as I gained seniority each summer I got offered higher pay jobs. Cue the call centre position. Great pay, and I was fairly good at it, but EVERY TIME the phone rang my heart would pound. I would find reasons to go on 'not ready' for an amount of time that was long but not long enough to have the supervisors question me. And I cut corners by not making the outbound calls that I technically should have. \n\nI lasted 4 summers in this job, which was actually pretty amazing. By the last summer, I had to drag myself out of bed. This past summer, I finally got up the nerve to turn it down (with the encouragement of my therapist who pointed out that it wasn't worth it to be stressed and unhappy for the two months that I'm technically supposed to have time off work as a teacher). And of course EVERYONE had an opinion about it, because they don't know about my anxiety. Those who at least know I don't like talking on the phone thought I was 'silly' and 'giving up a lot', and those who didn't know anything thought I was 'lazy' for 'not working 12 months of the year like everyone else does'. \n\nSo if anyone has the same phone anxiety, how do you try to explain it to people?",
