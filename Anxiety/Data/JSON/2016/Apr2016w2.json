            "selftext": "I saw a post about coffee down the sub, and think it's worth an even broader discussion here.\n\nI've had anxiety issues for thirty years. These days I'm far better now than ever before. Almost free of it.\n\nThe biggest factors were seeing a shrink, doing the Landmark Education (it's a seminar series aimed at breaking down cognitive self-sabotage, primarily)... and quitting caffeine.\n\nOf these three things, the caffeine was the biggest, most tangible game-changer.\n\nI have a cup of caffeinated tea in the morning. That's it. No soda, no coffee, no Red Bull or any other energy drinks; not even coffee ice cream for the rest of the day. I'm also a 4-hour-per-night insomniac, so I thought dropping caffeine would kill me.\n\nTruth is, I'd feel perkier with caffeine in my system. But I'd also be anxious a lot more. It's physical: the crawling-up-the-back sensation. The buzz. The sweating and nerves. It's mental: can't stop ruminating about things, worry about remote possibilities, dwell on past failures.\n\nThere's no question it's the caffeine. I experimented with it, going cold turkey for several months, then adding it back in at gradual increasing doses. Plateaued several times to make sure it wasn't a temporary response to the increase. Sure enough, even at very low doses, the caffeine popped my anxiety. Three cups of coffee over the course of 18 hours would have me climbing the walls.\n\nSo this is an informal study with only one subject, but if you suffer from anxiety and you consume caffeine, in my experience, the caffeine may be boosting your symptoms through the roof. Do the therapy and whatever other work helps. But while you're at it, consider that this commonplace substance, which nature evolved to addict insects to certain flowers, may have no role to play in an anxious person's life.",

            "selftext": "Just wondering if there are any guys here (anywhere on Reddit or the Internet) who're in their late 20s or older and struggle with anxiety. \n\nThis is a great subreddit and everyone is so supportive of one another, and yet when I don't see anyone at all who'se even close to my age, I can't help but come away from here feeling like I'm fighting a problem that I should have outgrown a long time ago. And it's hard not to feel ashamed and weird about that. I don't have to feel that way, I know, but I'm far beyond being able to think about any of this stuff on a rational level.\n\nI know that's just the nature of reddit and that the population here doesn't reflect real life and such but yeah, I don't know, I've just been looking for anybody at all who I can relate to just a little bit when it comes to trying to deal with this every day and, I don't know.\n\nIt all feels really shameful, this is a problem that kids and college students have and maybe grown women can admit to struggling with this without losing face but I don't know if I've evr come across any men over 30 who have ever posted anything here. And I'm sure they have but I'm just talking about my personal experience and impressions from lurking here (and on r/depression, which I could probably post the same thing about). Would be awesome if there was some kind of special subreddit for people over 30 with anxiety but even r/REDDITOVER30 hardly gets any posts on a given week. r/nontrads is dead, too (or was never alive in the first place).\n\nI'm super stressed and scared anout getting older, feel ashamed and embarrassed that I haven't accomplished more un my life at 36, feel really withdrawn from people my own age and always feel like everybody younger than me (at work and at school) is judging me, I can't control my thoughts and emotions and always feel wound up and in a panic. I've struggled with depression all my life but it wasn't until a year ago when anxiety stopped being something that I'd experience purely in strange social situations and something that I just started to feel all the time in places thatI used to feel safe, comfortable, and relaxed in. I'm almost done with school and need to focus and keep myself composed but my heart is racing all the time and I can't shut off my thoughts to concentrate on anything anymore. I'd love to get counseling but I only have Medicaid and after 2 months I'm still trying to get it set up and based on past experiences of simply trying to see a doctor, any doctor, for a routine physical, I don't have high hopes for getting into any counseling that could be close to me or work with my schedule. I don't even know if that's what I need, but I just want some help and I don't know where to turn.\n\nThat's assuming that I'm even worth spending any effort or money on. Young people need and deserve help, but I've literally never seen anyone in my situation who's come out of it okay and I'm wondering if... that's just the way it is? Like, you had your run, you can't cope with things anymore, too bad, suck it up and be a man, right? I really, really wonder if that's the reality I'm running from.\n\nI really don't want to deal with this anymore. Has anyone who's not \"young\" anymore ever dealt with this problem, or atleast found their way to the beginning of trying to find solutions to fix it? I just feel so beaten down by this, is this a moral failing of mine? Did I just wuss out and do this to myself? If that's the case, do I simply deserve to feel meek and nervous and scared and down on myself for itevery day? We always tell young people \"it gets better\" but we never say that to anybody over 30 and is there a good reason for that?\n\nSorry this went on and on, I don't have anyone to talk ti about this. I mean, I do, but I feel like it only beings her down and that that's selfish of me and it never really makes me feel any better, it only makes me more aware of how far I've fallen from being the kind of confident and competent person that I always thought I'd be at this age. And to be so far from that feels so damn pathetic I can barely find the words for it.",

            "selftext": "23 y/o male with PD here. After being diagnosed in 2014, I went on Zoloft with a 0.25 mg Xanax prescription. I've always been somewhat opposed to medications, especially those used for mental conditions, but at the time I was such a wreck I decided that I needed to do something. \n\nAfter feeling my anxiety was well under control, I got off the Zoloft and have been off for about one year now. It can be a bit of a struggle living with anxiety without daily meds, but I deal with it using exercise, yoga, meditation, therapy and a good diet. It's tough and requires a lot of will, but I'd say I'm still pretty happy. \n\nI still have the 0.25 mg Xanax prescription, though I rarely use it out of pure guilt. I feel weak when I get anxious and want to take one, and only ever actually do so when I'm about to crack. After going through a breakup this weekend, I built up the courage to take a single 0.25 mg tab last night for the first time in months. \n\nHoly f*$&amp; what a difference I felt upon awakening. \n\nIt's like a tiny 0.25 mg of heaven. I don't feel loopy, high, tired or zombie-like. I feel...normal. I feel like I'm ME again. Anxiety seems to make me forget who I am, as it seems that I am always consumed with worry and panic. \n\nI know the effects of the Xanax will eventually wear off today, and I don't plan on taking it daily, but I guess the point of this is that it's comforting to know that I can feel normal again.\n\nEdit: deleted strange text at bottom of post. \n\n",

Stress building up over the years is the main culprit but I honestly don't know. What mainly triggers my anxiety is stress, and heart rate increase, along with shortness of breath and chest discomfort. Almost everyday when these happen, i ask myself if its just anxiety or actual problems in my body. I have trouble sleeping almost each night, laying down only makes it worse. Heart palpitations are daily. I am prescribed Teva-Lorazepam which I only take .50 when I really need it. \nMy mood, attitude, the way I speak to the way I interact with people have all changed..I don't even feel healthy anymore, I feel really deprived and the life I had before is no longer there. Socialization/going out is very low and miss out on opportunities. \nBeing a college student and soon to graduate in about a month, I don't know what to do..especially when it comes to presenting in front of large crowds in class. I feel depressed, I am no longer me, I can't really talk about what I experience with people without the thought of them looking at me differently.\n\nWould greatly appreciate any comments, help or input.",

            "selftext": "Let me preface this by saying that seeking help for anxiety isn't bad, that's something completely different. That being said, I've been noticing a growing \"trend\" (especially among high schoolers, of which I am) of people who advertise their anxiety to get sympathy. I see so many tweets/texts/whatever that are just \"oh my anxiety is so bad I'm so stressed all of the time\" almost as if it's something to be proud of. Yes, I have anxiety, but compared to other people, I don't think it's that bad, and I'm seeing a therapist about it and it's definitely gotten better. However, I've really only told a few of my closest friends about it and try really hard to not use it to get attention or as an excuse. \n\nAlso, I'm pretty sure a lot of people complaining about it don't really have it. I'm sure some do, but if everyone who claimed to have anxiety, OCD,or depression actually had it, 80% of the world would be struggling with it. It just can really piss me off sometimes, because anxiety is not something to be proud of, it's a serious problem that needs help. ",

            "selftext": "I feel like I have made so many positive changes this year to cope with my social anxiety. Among many things, I don't binge drink to be numb, or negatively perseverate over my conversational contributions, or obsess to fill in lulls in conversation anymore. \n\nI confronted these things because I recognized that they don't have any place in the person I am and know that I can be when I am not letting the anxiety win.\n\nIn terms outside of anxiety, it's probably counter intuitive, but I get more anxious being around new people the more I respect them. I suppose I'm afraid that I'll disappoint them. \n\nThis fear is most apparent to me in regards to the exceptionally wonderful people in my life that invite me into their social circles from time to time. It feels amazing and I cannot stress enough how privileged I feel to be included. But it has a back to the wall feel in some ways.\n\nI know it's important to the friends that bring me around that I fit in and have fun. They love me, and I know that there's also an element of relief for them in me enjoying myself, and there's purpose for me, being there to support them. The fact that I really like who these people are and admire the way they carry themselves compounded with the need to fit in and be accepted for the friends that bring me around is a lot for me take on sometimes.\n\nI try to stay positive and I quell the phobic feels, but I'm worried it sends the wrong message to them when I try to be overly considerate, and not assume I should invite myself along. I'm sensitive, and it seems like the right thing to do, given my past, because I don't expect some of the people who saw me in my old unsavory ways to change their opinions\u2014I can only hope for the best. That's okay.\n\nLately, I do feel like I'm making up for it and managing to find some success in reconnecting with some of the people that I feel I alienated before. I feel much less like an outsider now than I used to.\n\nOne of these friends told me tonight that I always act like in just waiting for the chance to get away and leave. I can accept this as an honest communication from my friend of how they feel. I don't question their genuineness in telling me this. I do hesitate to put myself out there because I am simply trying to be considerate, and I worry they may read this as me being disinterested to being in this part of their life\u2014which is far from how I feel.\n\nI sort of hope their feelings correlate with my hesitation or lack of eagerness. If that's what's going on, I can understand why they feel this way.\n\nWhat's more worrisome to me is if this is what everyone in that social circle genuinely thinks is going on with me. It's crushing, to be completely unaware if I am sending this message. It makes me question if the progress I've made is real or just in my head.\n\nWhat's worse, is I feel comfortable being around these people finally. I hold them in such high regard. It has taken a lot of work for me to get here, and hearing this news would be debilitating. I'm worried the stigma would make me regress around them.\n\nI don't know what I'm looking for by posting this, but advice? Tips? Experiences? Honestly, I've already calmed down a lot since writing this, so that's nice. \n\nTL;DR- I've had recent success managing my social anxiety. I feel new confidence being around people I hold in high regard that my anxiety alienated in the past. My friend says I act like I am always trying to ditch out on social gatherings and I think it's because I hesitate and don't seem eager enough. I'm they're right and I haven't made the progress I thought I did. ",

            "selftext": "Hi, \n\nA bit of a backstory (First three paragraphs, skip if uninterested)\n\nI'm a trans gal with social anxiety stemming predominantly from the fact that I'm transgender (male to female), and very sensitive to negative reactions to me being trans that I get from some strangers (such as in a customer service environment).  Before I came out, I was able to be in society because I was just a shell, not really feeling anything, and the little times when I did show myself, I got negative reactions (or at least I interpreted them as negative) and immediately shelled up again and didn't let myself feel, out of fear of being vulnerable. \n\nI came out last year and it crushed me socially. I thought I would be able to function, but I was *not*.  I also smoked a bit too much green stuff, and got really paranoid, and had some borderline traumatic experiences. Couple that with the trauma built up over years of essentially wearing a mask, caused me to crumble.  I became quite literally a recluse, and hated myself for it. Living in a house with 5 guys who partied a lot, I would only leave my room to get water and food and use the bathroom.  Everytime I had to go into a communal area, I'd wait to hear if anyone was in the area (I lived in the basement and could hear the movement above because the house had thin walls and floors) because I was literally deathly afraid of interaction.  \n\nI'm a bit improved from then, but now I'm living back with my parents and quit college (due to not being able to go to class).  I was only going for a degree in philosophy though, so I don't consider it a major loss.  \n\nSo now I'm here, asking if there's any chance anyone knows of any legitimate and reliable ways to make some money online?  I have the luxury of being fed and housed by my parents, and don't have to pay rent and buy groceries thus, although I still don't enjoy living with them because they don't fully understand what it means to be trans (but they're trying).  \n\nThings I've looked into are freelancing and making music. I'm also probably going to start a kickstarter or gofundme to ask for help to pay the insane costs of my surgical bills (for genital and face surgery in the next few years--face surgery is necessary due to masculinized bone shaping such as a brow ridge). \n\nI think I could get a job in the \"real world\" if I absolutely had to, but it would mean going back to that place of not feeling anything, and pretending, and I hated that so much.  \n\nTL;DR:  I have residual social anxiety due to being transgender and would like to make money online if possible-to avoid having to present in society as more male, or to be beat down by negative reactions to being trans that I can't handle yet, and am wondering if there are perhaps any suggestions as to how to do that?

I don\u2019t feel in my body, but I can\u2019t get away from my mind.\nMy mind is devoted to these fears. Tied unconditionally, the bond cannot be broken. It consumes my mind. It consumes my body.

For the first few months, anxiety was pretty manageable because we were in a difference office that had higher-wall cubicles. But once we moved to new, open-plan office, my anxiety sky rocketed. It's terrible and nearly unbearable now, and I feel that I need a permanent break from my job.\n\nSome days, I feel like I'm going to break down and cry and am sometimes on the verge of doing so. I'm ALWAYS on edge with lack of privacy and constant chit chatter\u2014I can see and hear everything, and I have no physical barriers in between me and my other coworkers in my department. \n\nHas anyone else with social anxiety or GAD worked in an open-plan office? If so, have you ever quit a full-time, good-paying job with benefits because of your anxiety?\n\nI really just want to quit at this point. My health is suffering: I get chest pains and nausea way more frequently now and I just want relief and time to work on my anxiety. I currently see a therapist and she thinks that if I want to quit, I should. I should also add that I'm currently dealing with a sick parent as well, which is very hard to deal with at the moment. \n\nI am seeking temporary employment else where and do have a couple interviews lined up. I have enough in my savings account to hold me over for a month, but I do have rent and bills to pay, which does make me about 10% hesitant to quit. But I'm already thinking of my exit plan.\n\nTL;DR: I have severe anxiety now because of my open-plan office job and I want to quit. Also dealing with ill parent and I am seeking temp employment. Have a little in my savings account. Should I quit?",

            "selftext": "Hi everyone! \n\nI've been following this subreddit for a long time back when I was suffering from my anxiety, it gave me a lot of support! I have returned anxiety-free and hopefully this post will help someone out there with this hidden illness.\n\nAnxiety for me came from a depressive spell in my early teens. It truly hit me when I turned 17, when I nearly broke down doing a mini presentation in a class of only 3 people, all of whom I knew well. For the next two years of school, I turned down a lot of opportunities, dropped most of activities outside of school, and lived a monotonous routine where I'd study at school then hide at home until the next day. The consequences of these actions made me a bad perfectionist, I'd beat myself up about not getting 100% in a test for example. \n\nThe anxiety peaked last summer when a few traumatic events happened and I didn't get into college (but now I am). Living in the countryside meant that I rarely saw my friends or left my local radius. Consequently, things like going to the supermarket, getting my hair cut or meeting up with friends would give me chills, nausea and shaky hands, it was terrible and I feel for you if you get the same! I'm also one of those people who'd panic if they felt ill in front of others, so my anxiety about being sick ultimately made me ill. It felt like a huge disability and I ended up lying to friends and family about not being able to go out with them, just because it would frighten me so much.\n\nBut then in September I realised that my life had reached a dead point and I needed to change it. So:\n\n- I went on vacation abroad with my cousin. It was a fantastic experience and something that I really wanted to do, but never really thought I could go through with it. Sure, I felt anxious at times, especially waiting for my first flight, but it truly helped me to discover that 'living in the moment' feeling. Meditation never worked for me, but going on a road trip meant that everyday was different and my mind was completely focussed on the present. Plus I had my relative there to anchor me and offer me support if need be. \n\n- I went outside in the day. When I came back from the vacation, I started going outside a lot, whether it's just for a walk, doing some exercise or even when I wanted to text my friends! \n\n- I cut out my social media habits. I cut out my facebook news feed so that nobody's lives bothered me, instead I'd make the effort to see my friends and have a 1:1 chat, it made such a difference! It ultimately occurred to me that social media was really a way of people seeking attention that they aren't getting, almost a cry for help. If I see my friend post a 'happy' selfie on instagram, I ask them if they're okay and most of the time they're actually pretty down. \n\n- I called for take-out deliveries. Sounds crazy but I suffered from major telephone anxiety, but by writing down a weekly 'pizza delivery' script, I conquered that too once I found myself less reliant on it. Plus I'd be rewarded with pizza. \n\nA lot of these things are pretty demanding for people to do, I understand that. But what really worked for me was a constant change in environment and adopting an 'imperfectionist' about things. It's certainly a task, but reminding myself to have fun in life was the key. \n\nAll the best! Feel free to ask any questions. :)",
