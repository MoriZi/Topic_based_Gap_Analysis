            "selftext": "After another full blown panic attack, and an exceptionally rough first week back at my university, I decided that it was time to go seek professional help. I've always dealt with generalized anxiety and obsessive compulsive disorder, but never went and got the help that I needed. I've usually been decent at managing my symptoms, but since moving back to school I've had a difficult time adjusting, thus causing a lot of stress, anxiety, and symptoms of depression.\n\nSo, I made an appointment at my school's counseling center. I filled out a questionnaire describing my symptoms, and I consulted with one of the professionals about how I was feeling. It felt so good to actually be validated and have someone take my disorder seriously. However, this meeting's purpose was only to be a brief evaluation of how I was feeling, so that I could be matched with one of the counselors to meet with on a consistent basis. \n\nInitially, I was very nervous about this meeting (of course), but I'm so glad that I took this first step. I can't wait to start my actual counseling sessions and start making some more progress :) \n\nEDIT: I am very grateful for everybody's support! You guys are awesome! And yes, I will keep you updated about my future visits. :)",

My biggest, and most detrimental trigger, is driving. I'm 22 years old, a mom to a beautiful 3 month old. And I can't fucking drive. It's negatively impacted my entire life. Where I can move, where I can go to school, what jobs I can have, the list is never ending. No one understands, they think I'm just \"trying to get attention\" or that \"it's not that big a deal, everyone does it\". Don't you think I know everyone does it and that's there's something wrong with me!? Don't you think I'm well aware of how humiliating it is!? I can't just fucking get over it! If I even sit in drivers seat of a car it literally feels like my life is ending. I hyperventilate, literally can't breathe, tears start streaming uncontrollably, it's... Horrific for me. And everyone says \"just do it anyway\". But how can I possibly drive when I can't breathe and my vision is going out and I'm seconds away from puking? They just don't fucking get it... Sometimes even picturing myself behind the wheel can spark a full blown panic attack. I just switched to Lexapro from Zoloft about two weeks ago, I hope it helps. Idk, guys... I'm just so sick of everyone telling me how \"easy\" it is, how I need to \"get over it\".., I swear on my fucking life that if I could, I would. I fucking promise! It's just... It's not that easy.

A poster child, if you will. I got out against my will and also worked at a local logistics company, after I got out. I did my jobs well but wanted to get my degree (I'm about to graduate).\n\nI'm very technology savy so I did side wor (since I got out of the Army). Now, the side work is stressful, but a few years ago, the work at my job and the moon lighting was stressful but not anxiety-level stress, it just happend. Just writing it gets me sweating and upset.\n\nI'm good at my work but now I'd rather lay in bed, shut off my phone, and fear the next job. Its been over a week that I've been asked to do anything, but I still fear a phone call. But, if I just do the work, I'll be fine, but I don't. After 5PM I'm okay because no one calls. \n\nOne side of me says just do it, find a want to go forward. I'll wake up some days and just go all out. I complete a job, but other days I sweat it out in bed and have a shock feeling everytime I get an email.\n\nI'm being avoidant. I recognize that. Do I terminate a client and just stop my freelancing? Or should I hold steady and attack my anxiety?\n\nThere is a lot more that ties into my issues. But, combat aside, anxiety as a knowledgeable issue, should I tell my clients I'm moving on?\n\nUPDATE: I made it. I talked to the client and did work today. I'm delivering it Monday. As for my anxiety, I had my meds ready and used them twice, my jets are cool.\n\nAlso, as if an act of God, I got a drop of the hat IT interview for the County! No more stressful freelancing for me!",

I imagine something I have to do in the future, I gut react that it will be a terrible experience, and I try to forget about it. After the event has passed, I guilt myself heavily about not doing it. What and how much I avoid changes day to day, but there are a few that are pretty consistent; including going to class. ESPECIALLY morning classes. And when I want to avoid, I latch on to the first reason not to. But I've been seeing a new therapist and really desiring change, which resulted in my most recent \"big victory\".\n\nSequence of events:\n___________________\nI've missed some of this class already, I could drop it (reason 0)\n\nWent to bed late last night (reason 1)\n\nWake up late (reason 2)\n\nTake too long getting ready [making faces in the mirror?] (reason 3)\n\nToo late to get breakfast (reason 4)\n\nTraffic is heavy; there's a wreck on the interstate (reason 5)\n\nIt's raining, I have to walk half a mile, and I don't have an umbrella. It's 40F. (reason 6)\n\nI'm quite wet, 10min late, my hair looks weird because of the rain, people will see me walk in (reason 7-X)\n\nBut god dammit, I walked into that lecture and learned a lot. No one in the room gave a fuck. Every step of the way I had my usual intrusive, negative thoughts. But I kept thinking: No, I am going to finish this week by attending every single class. I'm going to overcome and succeed. I'm going to beam when I tell my therapist about this. I want it. \n\nMy point is, we can do it guys. It really is possible. Hell, if I had only gotten most of the way there, it would have been a partial victory. Each step of the way is an obstacle to overcome. Each intrusive thought must be identified and handled strategically. It's taken me a while to get to this point and I'm nowhere near done. It's very possible that I will miss a class in the future. But the more I do this, I know the easier it will get. Keep it up guys, we'll make it &lt;3\n\np.s. If anyone is interested in what my intrusive thoughts were at any point and how I handled them, feel free to ask. Could be educational. ",

I'm almost 22. Never had a real job. I've been a paperboy, had a summer job in a store, and I operated as a photographer in a studio for a few months as part of a school initiative. \n\nI've had anxiety for maybe five, six years at this points. I also have depression and ADHD. I'm just now getting some treatment for the ADHD, which will hopefully make me into more of a real person. \n\nThe last few years I have done nothing. I did re-do some of my exams from highschool to get the Norwegian equivalent of a GED. Now I'm in a business, leadership and economics program in university. It's only a year, but I figured it would look good enough on my CV, and It would allow me to postpone the real world some more. A lot of the theory would also be pretty useful in an office setting.\n\nI've noticed that after I started, my anxiety is worse. Or I'm just put into positions where I feel it more. Sitting in those lecture halls that are so tight that if you wanted to go outside, everyone on that row would have to move and press themselves into the seat behind them can be torture. Interacting with people is awkward. When we were supposed to do presentations I nearly died. Luckily some people on my group got sick. Hell, I can't even go to the hairdresser without getting panic attacks. For the last year I've cut my own hair, which inevitably results in a buzz-cut. Luckily I look okay with a buzz cut, but still. \n\nGoing for interviews is terrifying. Having my performance actually mean something is terrifying. The possibility of fucking things up for not just myself, but also other people and so on is terrifying. It would be a shitty retail job too, so I would have to interact with people constantly. More than anything I would love a cubicle job. That too scares me too, but less. I'm great at figuring out solutions to problem if I'm given time and space. That wouldn't happen in a retail job like this. I'm also afraid that it's something I just can't do, that it's something I would fail at. \n\nI'm mostly just ranting. My CV looks like shit. I don't really feel qualified for such a basic job either. At this point I just want to finish my year of schooling, go on welfare while I pretend that I can't find a job and just try to become a normal person. ",

I had horrible anxiety in the past; I was the quiet girl in school since I was too nervous to talk and be myself. It has gotten significantly better but I'm in my senior year of collage and am experiencing more anxiety than normal. My doctor upped my prescription to 100 mg. I mentioned that to my boyfriend last night and he was very upset that I'm \"trying to use drugs instead of fix the real problems.\" I have said I want to tapper off them and eventually not take any meds, but I don't think I'm there yet. How do I explain to him that this is best thing for me right now? I've been home all month for break not really doing much, but go back to school Monday where I'm signed up for a stress/ relaxation class, and a workout class. I'm also going to be more involved in organizations I'm already in. He thinks I'm not trying other things to help my anxiety, so that's why he's upset.

While I was understandably anxious, the makeout session itself went pretty well, and was there for quite a while until I had to leave to go to bed, considering it was nearly 3AM. \n\nHowever, I woke up this morning the most anxious i've been in a while, and I've had to try meditating to calm my nerves down. I just felt like I need to get this off my chest because I don't know how to proceed. I assume this is what is considered a \"casual hookup\", but I just feel nervous thinking about what to do next.

            "selftext": "For the last year I've been stuck working a god awful factory job that has me working mainly nights doing mind numbing work, the perfect environment for my anxiety to take hold and intrusive thoughts to take over to the point of panic attacks and nausea.\n\nThis has meant that I often (perhaps once every 2nd or 3rd week recently) go home sick (for which I'm not paid, as I am only a casual).\n\nTonight I vomited at work in a bucket in front of everyone, due not to anxiety but being actually sick (my 1 year old has been squirting out both ends, so I'm guessing I caught it off him). Ten minutes prior I had to run to the toilet because I thought I was going to be sick, and earlier today I had a massive case of the runs but decide to plow on and go to work tonight anyway.\n\nSo I go and tell my leading hand I'm going home due to being sick, and before I can finish saying that I had just vomited there in front of people he says \"The boss said you'd do that\". This is something who had lead me to believe they considered me a friend. Fuck that.\n\nI then do the right thing as I leave and go to tell the supervisor (something most people wouldn't bother with), and I get a similar response from him, carrying on that I'm always going home sick (his wife works with me, and is the laziest person there, who throws genuine sickies all the time).\n\nI'm desperately hoping I won't be in this job much longer, as I applied for a job last week (that I was hoping to hear about already, so that hasn't done much of my anxiety). But money is super tight and I need it until I find something else.\n\nNow I do end up going home sick more often than most, half the time this is due to panic attacks, and the other half of the time is being genuinely sick (having young kids means you're constantly picking up bugs). But I can't stand the thought of people thinking I'm a flake. Particularly as I feel that when I'm there I put in more effort than most others, and despite the shitty conditions and unpredictability of work (I never know, when, if or how much I'm working until the Friday before each week), I've stuck it out for over a year (during that time they've had over a dozen casuals come and go).\n\nNow that I know people think of me this way it's driving me crazy. What do I do?\n\nShould I tell my boss about my anxiety and explain that it's the cause of a lot of these issues (not sure how well that would go down, or if it would stay private, as I work and live in a small country town)?\n\nShould I be more vague and just explain that an ongoing condition is to explain for a lot of these absences? \n\nOr do I somehow try to learn to not give a fuck? (not very likely)\n  \n&amp;nbsp;\n\n*Update*\n\nMy 5 year old just woke up projectile vomiting. So at least I can be assured that tonight is really a case of being sick, and not just my anxiety manifesting itself into physical symptoms.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n*Update 2*\n\nCalled up the boss to get my hours next week. He mentioned nothing so I didn't either (too scared that in my pissed off state I'd start to have a go at him which won't help things). As it was, it took a Valium beforehand to get to the point of feeling well enough to make the call.\n\nFound out I have no hours next week (which means I probably won't be able to pay the rent next week). I'm suspiciousthat this is to 'teach me a lesson', but hard to know when to my face he acts like he has no problem (but I suspect he does).\n\nIt at least puts this little drama to rest for now. Which leaves my anxious energies to be directed towards worrying about money (more than usual) and freaking out about not hearing back about a job that I thought I was a really good chance of getting.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nSometimes I have days where I start to question if I have an anxiety issue at all. Then I have weeks like this where I feel like anxiety has completely ruined my life and left me with no resources to get it back on track. Fuck. This. Shit.",
