I know it may seem silly to celebrate a \"tentative\" job, but she very rarely hires anyone (has a small budget) and the fact that she's even considering it is validation enough right now! \n\nWorking one day a week, regardless that it's unpaid, has got me feeling more productive and confident and hopeful for the future.

Any time I'm in an emergency (weather, car, personal, medical), I fly off the handle and turn into a snotty, crying, shaking ball of emotion. \n\nI recently acquired a Jeep that was in pretty rough condition. Thanks to the help of some close friends, I've been able to get it up and running. Today it ran almost entirely without a problem. I was driving up to town from my new apartment (about 20 minutes drive). I get most of the way there, and notice a loss of power. I jam on the gas, no acceleration. I try to flip my hazards on (I'm on a bridge and can't pull over yet), but they don't go. Cars are whizzing past. I get off the bridge, coast a couple hundred yards, pull off, and kill the engine.\n\nI managed to keep myself from panicking during the entire ordeal. I called my dad for help on what to do, then call my friends for their mechanical advice. Not one time did I give in to my fear and emotion. I am really, really, really incredibly proud of myself for choosing annoyance over anxiety as an emotion for the situation. \n\nMay luck be with you all today! \n\nAnd the gas gauge was broken. It was out of gas but the gauge said half. Fixing that tomorrow. ",

And even when I do get the sensation it will only provide relief for a few minutes.\n\nThere have been times when I couldn't catch the feeling no matter how many breaths I take and it's extremely distressing, leading to a panicky feeling.\n\nSometimes I'll need to vary my approach. I'll try to surprise the feeling with a quick breath, or breath slowly in then sharply inhale when I'm on the cusp, or try to simulate a yawn.\n\nI recently went through a sort of breakup so I know it's stress/anxiety related.

I took another job a few weeks later that was a call center job, and I only lasted about a month and a half because the job gave me such extreme anxiety and depression, I just didn't wanna risk my health for a paycheck. So I am back on the job hunting front.\n\nThe job I was let go from was probably the best job for my anxiety I've ever had - never really had to interact with customers, was primary data entry and was able to zone out and do my work while listening to music. The worst thing about it was I still had to deal with my coworkers, which for the most part was fine, but there was a lot of company drama which I hated being a part of.\n\nAnyone have any idea of good jobs for anxiety? I know obviously everyone is a little different, but your experiences would inspire me what to look for. I need to work full-time at a job $10 or over, or part time at a higher wage job. ($15ish maybe?) to give you an idea of the sort of salary I am needing. Again I know that varies by location, but certain job types are usually at least similar in wages.\n\nI need a job compatible with my anxiety so I can focus on overcoming this obstacle, so I don't have something to help fuel it.",

            "selftext": "Hello reddit, I just wanted to share with you some pointers that I wish I knew sooner when dealing with my anxiety.\n\nFor about 3 years I've been experiencing some pretty terrible anxiety. It seemingly came out of nowhere even though I should, in theory, have little to worry about. I've had moments where I've sat in the bathroom at work with my head in my hands begging for the symptoms to stop. One day I had to tell my boss I had to go home and blamed it on feeling ill. In reality, I was on the verge of a panic attack and I went straight into the hospital to find help.\n\nI've been fighting this anxiety in full force for around a year and \nI now believe I'm starting to feel better. My states of panic are now further apart from one another I've also found myself having generally good thoughts.\n\nNow I'm going to tell you a few rules of thumb to help you right now that I apply every day.\n\n**The worst thing you can do when you're anxious is wrestle your thoughts** \n\nAs disturbing, dark and messed up as they may be. It's like turning the temperature up on a boiling stove. Sometimes you have to step aside and focus on not thinking and being within the present moment. Get into a comfortable and quiet position, focus on your breathing in and out and just turn the temperature down within your mind. Close your eyes if you want to but just breath and be until your mind has slowed down, anxiety attacks usually last around 15 minutes (general anxiety can last for weeks or months) but you'll be fine afterwards.\n\nI read a book called Mindfulness an Eight-Week Plan for Finding Peace in a frantic world by Mark Willaims and Denny Penman (This book is an absolute must buy!!). One thing that what was mentioned in the book was that the brain is a very good calculating machine that tries to find patterns and ways to solve things. Kind of like how our brains see faces on objects as we anthropomorphize. The problem with this is when it's applied to anxiety. Your brain is using a lot of mental energy to solve an issue that cannot be solved by thinking/calculating. You have to learn to shut your mind off and **be easy on yourself**\n\n**Anxiety is physical as well as mental**\n\nAs you apply the point above what you have to realise is that anxiety is as much mental as it is physical. Learn to scan each individual body part and relax. I would often tense up with my anxiety. I found myself clenching my fists, gritting my teeth, tensing my chest where my heart was and other body parts. No wonder science mentions that people die younger because of mental problems because you're stressing your body out. Learn to relax each individual body part out wherever you are. make sure you're very thorough and focus from your little toe to your head and learn how to relax each part. I remember having strange heart palpitations and pains in my chest from time to time. This freaked me out but after I learnt to relax my individual body parts it stopped.\n\n**If you can't find a comfortable position and a quiet place**\n\nI tend to brute force my thoughts but not in the way you would think. When I lose any sense of control and become isolated I tell my brain to give me more anxiety. I don't fight my thoughts but I will my brain to give me more. I don't purposely freak myself out and I try to keep my composure not getting angry with myself but I keep telling my brain to give me more. As I know that every single time I go through a horrible anxiety attack I've come out alive. I didn't go insane, my friends didn't hate me, my family wasn't about to die and I did well in work and these thought always ended up being false. I was *ALWAYS* fine it was just my brain going haywire. By willing your brain to give you more anxiety and showing yourself that you're not scared of the impending doom and despair. The anxiety actually starts to disappear. But only use this when you cannot find a quiet and comfortable spot.\n\n**Stop being lazy and get more active**\n\nI'm being serious with this one get on a treadmill and run until you feel like death. The boost of mental energy is amazing its like taking a drug, one that only had upsides. Better yet goto a martial arts class as many times as you can in the week to make you feel confident and work yourself to the bone. I recently joined an MMA gym and go around 3-4 times a week. Practicing Muay Thai, MMA, Boxing, Ju Jitsu.. the lot. This kind of exercise drains your mental and physical energy so much that after each session I didn't have the energy to worry anymore. I would feel awesome beyond belief. The endorphins that get released into your brain help you immensely. After a workout too you will feel like you can sleep ALOT better because you're bodies exhausted. Your brain also receives a cognitive boost and I no longer get that sense of feeling stupid, alot of the time anyway. I also feel a hell of a lot more confident.\n\n **Get Medicated If You Have To**\n\nMedication may seem like a big thing but in the grand scheme of things its not. If it puts you on the road to recovery and helps you out that little bit extra then speak to your doctor. Some people even experience NO SIDE EFFECTS whilst if you're like me well I did experience some.\n\nI would wake up each morning throwing up, feeling dizzy, couldn't sleep having waking nightmares and generally felt fucking awful as a side effect from the medication. But I persisted knowing that if I stopped the medication now I would become alot worse. Now after a few months on medication, I feel great.\n\n**Mental States Are Like the Weather**\n\nThe brain cannot maintain a steady state of mind. Meaning that it's not possible to be happy all the time. Your emotions are much like the weather you cannot control them. If it rains put up your umbrella, if you're sad, understand this is a passing emotion out of your control. Often trying to be happy all the time is counter-productive. You often start blaming yourself for not being happy all the time and get sad as a result. The funny thing is though, is that it's impossible to have this state of mind forever. As soon as you stop worrying about what mood you're in your overall state of worry will also decrease.\n\n**You May Be In This for The Long Term**\n\nIf you suffer with a mental illness it can be much like diabetes where it's something that you have to deal with for the rest of your life or, at least, a long period of time. This isn't necessarily a bad thing it's just a fact of life and it also doesn't mean you can eliminate most of the symptoms and live a happy life. Just don't expect results overnight, sometimes you have to stick to a strict regime of self-healing for a long period of time until you start seeing good results. Just remember that with the correct help and commitment you can drastically improve your life.\n\n",

Physically I just felt very crappy and I was in constant fear or having a heart attack or diabetes or cancer, or some other horrible disease. 4 months or more ago I went to the doctor because of how physically crappy I was feeling and after being issued a clean bill of health and talking with my doc we realised it was anxiety and depression and I went on medication. Now I keep having to play this game though where every time I feel even the slightest bit funny or the slightest bit off I'm like OH GOD IS IT MY ANXIETY AGAIN OR IS IT SOMETHING ACTUALLY SERIOUS THIS TIME?\n\nI'm terrified that I'll write something off as anxiety, but it will actually have been something serious and I'll die. Just feeling freaked out right now and could use some love and advice.",
