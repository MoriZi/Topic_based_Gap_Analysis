Because i am so anxious in public and around people, i am always tense and find it hard to smile. I get paranoid too. I had a bad history of bullying and people making fun of me in the streets that i always am in high alert when in public. Today i went with my mother out to buy a few things and when we were standing outside a store talking about if she wants to buy something in front of it. I had an umbrella out and a random man walking past says to me \"Hello girl\". For some reason i got really anxious and couldn't say anything. I felt embarrassed of my appearance and didn't want him to see how i really looked. I focused on my mother and what she was saying. Then notice through corner of my eye that the guy kept looking back. I felt bad :. Apparently my mother did not hear him, so i try to tell myself that hopefully i made him think that i did not hear him and  my back was also facing him as well. \n\n\nBut still i felt bad and when i told my mom she said that \"you see you make people feel bad too/can be rude too.\" The weird thing is i always wished to that people would say hi/adknowledge my presence then when they do i get scared out of my mind and try to hide in my shell. I hate being like this :/\n\nHave you ever had incident where you felt like you were rude and felt guilty about it later?",

            "selftext": "My previously untreated anxiety got really bad this June and I was having panic attacks almost all the time and got to a point where I was just pacing around my room too scared to leave or eat, which isn't like me at all. I found an amazing doctor, he prescribed me 10mg of Celexa to take daily and .5mg of Ativan to take as needed. He told me the concerns with benzos and I also read about them so I was trying my best to go as many days without them but during the month of July I was taking one every day to be able to function. \n\nWe had another meeting 4 weeks ago and he switched me to 10mg of Lexapro because I didn't feel better. However during those 4 weeks I improved a lot, went a day without a benzo, then got up to 2 days, 3, etc. and today I'm happy to announce 1 week without having one! I feel pretty good, still a bit anxious, afraid of throwing up when I go out, and certain situations still cause panic, but I saw my doc today for a follow up and he was very proud of my progress. He said I will continue to see improvements with Lexapro and will prescribe me Ativan if I need it, and now I'm working to find a psychologist as he said one day I might be able to come off Lexapro with the help of CBT.\n\nJust feeling pretty good about life and my progress so far! Hopefully this inspires some hope that things can get better. Also medication was a literal life saver for me.",

            "selftext": "Alright, so I just moved into college about a week and a half ago. Before then I had been pretty much free of anxiety all summer and was only slightly anxious to be moving in, and after the move in was over that anxiety was pretty much gone. The first week or so up until wednesday were great, I was meeting people and making friends. I had been friends with my roommate previously and he's a great friend. I also got to know a few more people in the dorm pretty well through the events following move in. When classes started I realized college is way more work than high school, but there's a lot of time throughout the day to get shit done. \n\nBut my anxiety started with a girl, let's call her G, and has now flowed over to the point where I'm anxious about everything. We had been talking since the day after move in, so two thursday's ago. Personally, I think we clicked pretty well, we had a lot in common with similar backgrounds and interests. So I would hang out with her all the time, until last wednesday. We had been sitting on her bed in her dorm doing homework and when we finished we pretty much just talked for an hour or so. I made a move and cuddled up to her. She responded well and cuddled back for about half an hour before telling me she had an 8AM class and was gonna go to sleep. So I left and went to my dorm feeling pretty good. Then, the day after, she avoided me all day. I asked about lunch/dinner and doing our math HW at night after class, but she declined on all. I figured she was just legitimately busy and didn't think much more of it. \n\nThe next day, friday, I again asked G about lunch but she declined. However, she said that she wanted to go pick up the laptop she just bought from bestbuy around. So I met up with her before that and we took the bus over to the bestbuy. I don't know why, but the entire thing felt super awkward. I tried making conversation, but pretty much got one sentence short answers. It was like she wasn't even the same person. We got back to our dorm and I asked if I could come chill in her room, but she said she had to take a shower and was gonna go talk to her roommate about something. I asked her to text me if it was cool later. Then about 20 minutes later I got a snapchat from one of my friends, S, (who has a girlfriend and isn't looking for anything) who was apparently having dinner with G and her roommate. This is when my anxiety started because I felt as if I was being avoided. \n\nThe rest of the night is some fucked shit. I went to chill with S and found G in his dorm with a few other people I know. They were facebook stalking G's roommate's friend. After they finished searching this guy, G left. Me, plus the other guys, went to target because we all had shit we needed to pick up. When I got back to my dorm I decided I was just gonna go to be and try to forget everything hoping that I would feel better in the morning. I fell asleep around 11 and was woken up at 11:30 by my roommate who had been at a family function. He said he was gonna go chill with his girlfriend and left. I fell back asleep and was again woken up at around 1:30 when he got back. This is where shit gets really weird. He told me that G had been out with a couple of her friends getting high and drinking and shit, and that she was hanging out in S's room now. I check my phone, and see that G hit me with the \"are you up\" text at around 12:30. Lemme just say really quick that i'm not the type of guy that would take advantage of someone who's fucked up, and I am not into one night stands and shit anyway. So I throw on some pants and a shirt and walk down to S's room. S and his roommate are just chilling with G and I sit down and talked with all of them until 2:10 or so when S kicked us out to sleep. Whatever G had was pretty much worn off by now and she walked with me over to my dorm. Apparently her roommate had someone over and she didn't wanna go back and sleep in her dorm. We sit in the hall for a while and talk, and it was good conversation like it had been the first few days. Not like the awkward shit conversation that we had while getting her laptop. Eventually, I ask her if she sees me as a friend or more than that, and she just says she wants to get to know me better. Eventually I suggest that we go sleep in my dorm because she's practically falling asleep in the hall. She agrees and we go in and she sleeps with me in my bed for the rest of the night. She seemed really into me at that point, I wasn't gonna try anything like cuddling or shit but she pretty much pushed into me and spooned. We woke up at around 7 (it was fucking hard to sleep because the dorms are  not air conditioned so when you're sleeping with someone it's hot as fuck) she smiled and thanked me for letting her sleep in my dorm. I said it was not a problem, and asked her if she was still down for going hiking later that day which is something we had been planning on since tuesday. She said she was pretty tired right then and told me to ask her later that day. So I did around one and she declined saying that she had a lot of work to do, but didn't want me to think she was ditching me. I asked her about lunch and dinner the rest of the day but she declined on both. \n\nI went over to hang out with S and his roommate. His roommate told me that before I had showed up the night before she told them that she just wanted to be friends with me, and nothing more because she didn't wanna be tied down in college yet. I totally understand that, but it gave me horrible anxiety, and I'm not sure if it's from being friendzoned, if it's from being basically ignored all day by G, or if it's because of all the fucking mixed ass signals she gave me all week. But in the last 15 hours or so since this my anxiety has basically snowballed so that I'm fucking anxious about everything going on. I decided I wasn't gonna text G first and ask her to do shit anymore. And honestly I don't even know why the fuck i'm writing this and this probably isn't the best subreddit for it but I feel better just getting it off my chest.\n\nAnyway, there's the backstory to what set off my anxiety, I have a fucking german quiz tomorrow and need to calm the fuck down so I can study for that shit. Thanks if you read all the way down here and any suggestions or insights into the entire situation are appreciated. Right now I literally cant focus on hardly anything at all.",

In these chats, you learn small lessons and exercises that are designed to gradually help you build coping skills and resilience.\nIt's aimed at people who experience worry or feelings of anxiety and want to do something about it - but it's not an alternative for a professional treatment.

My anxiety is so high when I date anyone because I worry about such little things. I over think in my head and I feel my heart pound and I feel tingly. I don't know how to stop it and I know it stresses me out and my significant other. I hear every tone anyone gets me and if they sound irritated it triggers me and makes me feel like I'm annoying them and that in itself makes my anxiety shoot up. So many things bother me that shouldn't, it's so hard. I recently moved in with my boyfriend and we've been working together since April. He's in a higher position to me and he may be getting promoted and be transferred and it makes me so sad and worries me. He helps me out a lot here and I'm so use to seeing him here...we both stay at work more than we're at home. I'm just really scared, stressed, and anxious. I'm not use to change. I get anxious to even talk to him because I feel so stupid and clingy. How do I overcome this or at least cope?",

The whole time I basically pushed my interview thoughts to the back of my mind, thinking that it would be best not to dwell on anything until the actual day. \n\nWell today came around. I woke up and was immediately silent and in my own head, barely talking to my girlfriend - who knew I would be like this and jumped right to being supportive. The build up of emotion started and I broke down. First crying. Then hyperventilating. Then the feelings of wanting to give up. After about an hour of this, I did. I gave up. Like always. I felt as if there was no way I would be able to leave the house. Let alone make it there and have a conversation with someone who was tasked to assess me. Now the relief has washed over me, but the panic is instead replaced with feelings of disappointment and hatred for myself. I feel like I am not made for this world. Like I am abnormal and defective. \n\nHow did we get like this?",

Sometimes when I'm asked a question (especially if put on the spot or in front of other people) I will panic and just say something without thinking it through or without fully understanding the question and then ask myself \"why the hell did I say that, it's not remotely true\". And then I'll be too nervous to correct myself so I don't say anything and spend the next few hours running it over and over in my head. It doesn't really get me in trouble because like I said a lot of the time it's about really unimportant stuff, but it's still very irritating. Anyone else have this happen?",
