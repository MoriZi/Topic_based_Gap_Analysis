            "selftext": "this has probably been posted before but i wanted to share anyway incase someone is in need of a quick calming solution. this technique really simple but its honestly the last thing i would think to do when having a panic attack.\n\nJust hold your breath for 30 seconds. one big diaphragmatic breath (with your tummy more then your chest if that makes sense) hold it for 30 seconds and then after you exhale take in slow breathes every 10 seconds or so for roughly a minute. I always wear a watch to concentrate on when Im out now and I feel safer now because I know that if i feel uneasy, overwhelmed or panicky I can just look at my watch and do this breathing technique.\n\nI have panic disorder and agoraphobia and this technique is helping me out a lot and I have not had a full on panic attack since I learnt it. once or twice it has got to the point where I am struggling to hold my breathe due to an uneasy feeling of fainting but I have persisted and it has worked.\n\nIts the same idea as hyperventilating into a paper bag. this technique is reseting the levels of carbon in your blood stream. When we panic the levels of carbon are out of whack which is why we feel all panicky and not right and have wierd sensations throughout our body. This works really quick and best of all you can do it anywhere without anyone even noticing. \n\nI hope this helps someone in need.",

In school (grad student), I'm no longer someone that people ask for help or advice because I dismiss anything that's not related to what I want, and tend to be off on my own planet.  So last night I made a promise to myself to get better. \n\nI'm making changes and finally asking for the help I know I need. I just called a new therapist to set up an appointment.  I'm making concerted effort to be more positive and less negative in both my thoughts and my conversations with others.  At night, I'm focusing on being at home with my family and not wasting time online or playing stupid computer games by myself.  I started working out again.  \n\nI still feel like there's a giant hand holding my lungs and heart but I know it's going to start loosening and eventually will go away.

I was discussing my issues (chronic stress, anxiety and depression) with my mother and she said 'Everyone has anxieties, you're just not strong.enough to deal with yours'. Another discussion I had, this one with my bf, ended with him basically saying I make up these issues in my head and my.belief in them is what the issue is. I have been officially diagnosed with these issues. I suffer from severe pains due to stress (I'm sure some of you are familiar with the stomach and chest pains ugh) and occasionally throw up when I am overwhelmed. Some days I can not bring myself to leave the house. Some days I can't even leave the bed. In just so tired of being told by loved ones that it is me consciously making these decisions and not my issues. How can I explain to these people so that they will understand or is there just no point? Anyone have any related stories?",

I'm just in a pretty bad place right now and I don't have any specific questions, I just need to get stuff off my chest.  I'm 15 and have been going to therapy for GAD and also some issues with depression since I was 10. I honestly can't really remember my life without my anxiety and everyone tells me it will get better but even though there are times it gets better for a few months the overall trend is most certainly a downward spiral.  \n\nThree years ago I dropped out of school for about 4 months before switching to a private school with one on one classes specifically for people who need a school tailored to their sports or medical issues or whatever. In the two years since then I have continued to have periods half way through out the year where I miss around 3 months of school.  Just this Monday I went back for the first time since January.  But I'm not ready to be back and I can feel myself getting close to going into another complete shut down. Going to truancy court would probably send me completely over the edge since I've always been the stereotypical \"good kid.\"  So I'm not allowed to just try to get better, instead I have to keep swallowing all my problems but the length of time I'm able to do that is getting shorter and shorter.  \n\nI'm just so scared.  The only thing I've had to look forward to for years is going to college and beginning to do what I want with my life but I'm starting to realize my anxiety is not going to be under control in time for that. My intelligence is the only thing I've ever felt confident in, and even then I always get anxious about being too prideful.  But now even that is being ruined by my paralyzing fear of failure that makes me unable to do anything in the first place. I'm so afraid of what schools will think when they see my huge periods of missed school and I'm so afraid that the separation anxiety I get is going to force me to go to school right where I live, which I've always absolutely hated the idea of. I'm sorry this is so long, I just was hoping for some kind words or advice from those of you who have gone to college with anxiety. Thanks so much for reading this. ",

I had been thinking about quitting as my job as a photographer required lots of travel and I would constantly worry about getting lost or being late. \nMy boss was also very critical,  and the day before I quit I was lectured on a mistake I made in my work. I didn't experience a panic attack but I was shaking and later I cried a little. I was unable to stop thinking about it for days. Even now the memory of it causes me pain. I'm currently studying computer programming to find a new career. \n\nThe something happened today. We have a cleaning rota at the apartment I rent and this morning as I left for college I spilled some muesli flakes on the stairs. There was no time to clean it so I decided to do it first thing when I got home. But I was worrying about it all day, because my flatmates are very particular about keeping the place tidy. \n\nAs soon as I got home I found the mess was cleared up and my flatmates confronted me about it. I apologized but I felt so bad I could have cried. I felt utterly worthless and useless. \n\nI want to get help for this but I don't know what to call my condition. I don't consider myself an anxious person. I'm generally pretty easy going and I've never experienced a panic attack. But when this happens It's like I just shut down and can't handle it.

            "selftext": "I'm in college and I'm struggling a lot recently/in general (lol when am I not struggling?) I took a leave of absence after a year and a half and went to a therapeutic wilderness program and then residential treatment because of my extreme depression, anxiety and general inability to do school. I lived in Vermont, which was beautiful, and thrived there with the support of *a lot* of people. Now I'm back at my high-pressure NYC school and have to meet with an academic coach 3 times a week (plus 2-hour study hall on Sundays) and therapy twice a week just to stay afloat. It's so so so demoralizing knowing that I'm spending absurd amounts of money, between tuition, rent and mostly these RIDICULOUSLY expensive appointments, just to be able to do what \"normal\" people do. A few weeks ago I freaked out and thought of dropping out/randomly moving to some nice non-city and just taking a break again. But I can't keep running away--I'm pressuring myself so much to graduate and be traditionally successful. Planning on taking 4 summer classes to make up for lost time in treatment and hopefully I'll be able to graduate next year. I haven't given myself a break from the city or school at all since I took a January class over winter break, and all these appointments + commute time (coach and therapist are far from where I live) feels equivalent to committing to a part-time job.\n\nAnyway, I have a lot of anxiety, as well as depression/some sort of mood disorder (was diagnosed as bipolar a few years ago,) as well as ADD and executive function issues. I procrastinate a lot and can never manage to hand anything in on time. (Also, not procrastination in the Buzzfeed-esque sense of \"hahaha I'm so stressed I just watched Netflix instead of doing my paper! wow college!\" More like I can stare at a screen for 8 hours trying to write something and I can't initiate.) I legitimately would not be able to do anything if I weren't working with my coaches. They say we're working on improving my skills so I'll be able to function better and decrease the hours that I work with them, but it's not happening. I'm perpetually stressed and that stress skyrockets right before an assignment's due. I had a homework assignment due today that I blocked out 4 hours today to do--I really thought I'd be able to finish on time. The first hour was with my coach and I got some work done, but didn't really keep up the momentum after she left. Then I got a really anxiety-inducing phone call (that I shouldn't have picked up) and that lasted half an hour. The second I got off the phone I started panicking. I was so riled up and couldn't calm myself down--I should've taken a klonopin, and I still should but of course there's a difference between thinking that and being able to force myself to go into my backpack and get it and get water and take it. (Executive functioning/problems initiating.) So now everything's hitting me at once and I've tried so hard but class is in 20 minutes and I'm skipping and my assignment isn't done and I hate myself. I've been in a bad place lately and feel so shitty. Texted my coach and she basically just said \"Try to initiate. Pretend I'm there. You can do it.\" But clearly I can't.",

            "selftext": "Edit: I'm a lot lot better now, I've overcome a lot in life and am finally without a care in the world. \nI met with a psychologist and psychiatrist, and well, they really did help me tremendously along with the moral support of the people here and at home :)\nI feel great. No more of crying or dwelling on negative thoughts.\nI look back at the old me and laugh at myself for having wasted so much of my time while no one else really cared how I felt. Anyway, I'm never going back to that dill hole/ pessimist life again :D\n\nI was a boy who would cry at every single thing, just because he was afraid that he is not masculine enough. I was made fun of my private parts and whatnot, and I'd come home and cry out loud and hide myself in a room, so no one knew that I'm crying. I could not even control how I acted in front of people, so my muscles involuntarily contracted in public due to tremendous anxiety.\nTo those who feel distressed and are totally lost should not lose hope.\nIf a completely suicidal case like me has improved so much.. then you definitely can\n\n\n\n\n\n-----\nOriginal Post: -\n\nI have a terrible social anxiety and I have been thinking that I am gay. I'm very sure I am, and I just haven't been able to accept this fact, which is a reason for my horrible and worsening social anxiety. \n\nWhen I am in a social situation(at my school), each and every second, bad thoughts about how I am gay and others might find out, come to my mind. My muscles really tense up because I feel my facial expressions are not masculine, and when I get back home from school, my face, head and neck muscles ache terribly. I have to sleep for 4-5 hours to lessen the pain, but it doesn't really help. And I can't do my homework or pay attention to what is being taught in the school. \n\nI have literally tried EVERYTHING! That cognitive behavorial audio therapy by Dr. Thomas A. Richards.. I've tried meditation, I've read hundreds of thousands of articles and books to get rid of my social anxiety, but maybe I am just not able to accept myself like this. I am NOT comfortable in my body. I feel like I am out of place because no one else is gay where I live. And where I live, people do not approve gay people at all. If I told my family, they would make fun of me, and even not believe me. My friends already make fun of me when I act differently(unlike a boy). However, over the past 5 years, I've been trying my best to behave like a boy so no one has suspected me to be gay. I cry a lot many times at night before sleeping and I can't even control it. I just keep thinking, why me? \n\nEvery day I have school, coaching or any friend coming over, my anxiety and these negative thoughts about sexuality come to my mind. I get HIGHLY ANXIOUS in social situations, and the muscle tension on my face is TERRIBLE!\n\nI am very sensitive about all of this, and I've had a lot of suicidal thoughts lately, so please, I beg, no rude comments.\n\nI just want to know what can I do, or if there is anything I can do, to feel better and get a new hope for life and feel happier and less anxious. Thanks a lot!\n\n\nJust to add, I am 17 years old, male, in high school.",

But here's the difference between panics in the past and what happened tonight. This is not spiraling out of control because I'm not overmanaging it. I'm not trying to shut it up, and I'm not letting myself overthink the various problems in my life. I have a high stress job, a high stress location, my safety is not always guaranteed. And that's just fine. I have no more control over what happens to me here and now than I do in my home country, with my family, drinking that shit tea my wife buys all the time. I am ok. You're ok. The good in the world moves on.\n\nEdit: You guys are alright. I like you.",
