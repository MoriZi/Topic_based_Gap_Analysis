I was planning on getting my masters right after graduation but everybody I talk to tells me to take a year off but I'm just like, what the fuck do I do during that year? How do I know if I am ready for grad school? How do I know what to do? Part of me just wants to stay in the same state and find a basic job and just chill for a while, but how do I know whether that is genuinely best for me or if I am just afraid?\n\nI'm currently doing an internship in DC and am equating this experience to what it will be like after graduation. I don't have any friends in my program and my boyfriend (who has two more years of undergrad than me) is back home and I'm not feeling at home at all. I work 8 to 4, have an hour long commute each way, end up just laying around all evening, and am getting pretty homesick. I'm counting down the weeks until I get back, but the thing is, I can't do that if I move for grad school. There will be no \"home\" to return to. I can't just count down until I go back, because there will be no back.

            "selftext": "I've been a basket case my whole life. I did get some help when I was younger that definitely steered me in the right direction but for the most part, my story is the single mom who, while struggling with her own mental illness, tried to navigate the bureaucracy of public health clinics to get help for a daughter that wasn't really showing any outward signs of the torment going on inside. When you don't threaten to hurt yourself or someone else, cause trouble, or scream really loudly.. you get one half hour appointment every six months with someone who's just too relieved your not going to be another headache case to really listen.\n\nIt sucked. There I said it. It sucked growing up. It sucked that everything was so scary. It sucked when I couldn't breathe after getting called on in class. It sucked feeling people's eyes on me like tiny knives carving into my skin. It sucked coming home and curling up in a ball for NO REASON other than \"it's too much\". It sucked not being able to do the things I wanted to do. It sucked spending night after night not sleeping, just imagining every way that the world was going to end. It sucked laying in bed in the morning unable to get up because the weight of SOMETHING (I don't know what but it certainly felt like everything in existence) is pushing down on you..whispering in your ear that if you get out of bed everything will go terribly wrong. It sucked thinking everyone hated me, laughed at me, wanted me to just go away. It sucked to hate myself.\n\nBut something happened. \n\nFebruary of 2011 I decided that I was sick of being so afraid of fucking everything. I have always had this visualization of my anxiety as a separate entity from my personality, from me. I love people, my anxiety hates them.. that kind of thing. That visualization was my key to getting through high school. When I really HAD to do something that was terrifying I would visualize the anxiety as a fog I just had to walk through.. If I could just get through it and to the other side then everything would be okay, I would love whatever it was that I was doing. So in February of 2011 I made a commitment to walk through the fog every day. To acknowledge that shit was freaking me out, breathe, and roll through it anyway like a mother fucking boss.\n\nIt was hard. I didn't notice any change. I didn't feel any less scared. But I just kept moving through it every day... doing the things I WANTED to do, that sounded cool, that I admired in other people and not giving a shit what the anxiety fog was saying.\n\nIt's been 1,235 days. \n\nI moved about 2,500 miles away from the town I grew up in with two suitcases and $300 in my checking account. I subsequently moved back in forth two more times. I have a job that I love and only got because I walked into a shop and said \"hey, I like what you do you should let me work for you.\" I have friends that seem to like me for some reason or another, or at least they keep inviting me out for drinks. I'm dating this guy who is the first person I've ever just NOT wanted to run away from.\n\nI go dancing.\n\nHah, dancing! If you had asked me four years ago if I would be the kind of girl who goes drinking and dancing and makes jokes and has fun, I would laugh out loud!\n\nIt's not a perfect system. I still have a lot of anxiety. It's a fight every day and sometimes I just say \"fuck it, I'll fight tomorrow.\" There are weeks and months of depression and extra stress.. and damnit, there's new strange things to worry about all the time.\n\nBut it gets better. There's an \"other side\". And I didn't even realize till I got there.\n\nOkay..rant over, but I figured there might be somebody here that understands..",

            "selftext": "Yesterday, I had really upbeat day at work. I even enjoyed listening to music on the way, something that lately has been a trigger for me (certain songs place me in a certain place and time.).\n\nThen last night, I take 1mg of extended release Xanax as prescribed, two hours later, wake up in a puddle of sweat, heart pounding and nauseous. I take a quick acting Xanax, go back to bed a fall back asleep. Nightmares and disturbing dreams follow. I wake up two hours later, another panic attack in a pool of sweat, another 1mg Xanax to get back to sleep.\n\nI make to 5am, wake up feeling sick, paranoid, depressed and anxious. This happens almost every night. By 6:30am, I am functioning again and leave for work.\n\nMost nights, the extended release Xanax gets me through the night, but I have been under a lot of pressure at work, and Father's Day is coming up. I have been estranged from my son for five years. I will spend the day with my mentally retarded daughter, whom I love the shit out of, and is one of the lights of my life.\n\nMy second wife is wearing down. I keep giving her the analogy, \"No one would tell a guy with a broken leg that if he just maintained a positive attitude, he could run a marathon.\" \n\nThe funny thing is, I fought off the anxiety for thirty years by shutting down, something I learned as an abused child. I finally let my guard down to be with the amazing woman, and I feel like I am letting her down.\n\nI can't control it. I carry two emergency Xanax in my pocket pill caddy, but I have never used them. I can get through the day, but I dread the night.\n\nAnd we have a wild sex life. It is a wonderful diversion. For about and hour. Then the night horrors kick in.\n\nNext week, we leave on Friday for a nine day cruise. No cell phones, not internet, just each other. We come back, I work four days, and then I am off the 4th of July and week after (I have my daughter) and we are spending it at the Jersey shore.\n\nI never felt like I needed a break more, but I, being me, am already putting pressure on myself to have a good time and not spoil her dream trip.\n\nNow, around 8:30, I start tensing up, almost every night, dreading the lights going out. I actually wake up and think about using my impressive array of drugs in my closet to just end this trip once and for all.\n\nI don't want to die, but I can't bear living like this. And the anxiety, after being successfully suppressed for 42 years came on my so bad five years ago, it cost me two jobs and, if I am not careful, could cost me a second marriage.\n\ni don't know what else to do. I am in therapy, I am on meds, I try to eat right but I can't get any consistent rest, except on the weekends I sleep until 2:00 in the afternoon because of the depression.\n\nMy life feels like it is imploding. I don't know how to find the switch to turn off the fear and anxiety. It is killing me. It is making my Crohn's hard to manage. It is ruining my life. I can't find relief. ",

            "selftext": "Hello everyone! I have been suffering from anxiety for the last eleven years, recently diagnosed bipolar, and started taking medicine for these conditions.\n\nEleven years ago, when my anxiety started, I was following a very unhealthy lifestyle. Eating less than 600 calories a day, smoking cigarettes, etc. The worst thing was the constant heart palpitations that kept me up all night and sent 15 year old me to the hospital regularly. I continued killing my own body until I became pregnant with my first child about 6 or seven years ago.\n\nThe last couple of years I've been following the keto lifestyle, which is fantastic. It's really helped with some of my symptoms from mood disorders. But here's the kicker: I was reading about vitamin deficiencies and electrolyte imbalances and decided to start supplementing my diet (with help from my doctor, obviously). Apparently certain imbalances and deficiencies can cause palpitations, disorientation, and even psychosis! I took 250 milligrams of magnesium with my lunch for a couple of days. \n\n*Haven't had heart palpitations since*. It's really crazy, I've been dealing with them for half of my life, and they're gone. I know it's not the other medicine, because I still had the palpitations with it. And I still have anxiety, don't get me wrong; but without my heart flopping and fluttering it makes it easier to say \"you're just panicking, nothing is wrong\" and take control of the situation.\n\nAnyways, I'm not a doctor, but I would suggest you all check into it. I know that because it worked for me it might not for you, and maybe some of you can't take supplements with your medication. But if it's one more thing that helps you fight against fear, it's definitely worth a try. \n\n*TL;DR: Started taking magnesium supplements, heart palpitations disappeared. Anxiety remains, but is more manageable. I hope this helps someone!*",

            "selftext": "I've been unemployed for over a year now and all of my resources have dried up. Unless I go on welfare, which I'm not sure I can and would rather not do, I'm going to have to find work asap.\n\nMy employment background is as a project manager within the video game industry. As many of you have heard in the news and elsewhere this career path could be considered non-conducive to a healthy mental state. Be it drugs, alcohol, or pills, far too many of my colleagues were self-medicating just to keep afloat. \n\nAside from the initial terror and anguish that a new job will likely bring, albeit temporarily, I will admit I'm far more concerned of landing yet another job where I'm slowly milled into emotional, spiritual, and physical paste. I don't feel I could handle that yet again; third (fourth?) time's the charm? After all, it feels as if one can only reconstitute themselves so many times and I'm so very tired of doing so...\n\nSo I'm hoping that some of you might have had some luck or perhaps have some words of wisdom in regards to finding work that both pays the bills and isn't totally adverse to our particular disposition. I recognize that there isn't a one-size-fits-all answer to my question but I'm still quite eager to hear what solutions you might have found.\n\nMany thanks in advance!",
