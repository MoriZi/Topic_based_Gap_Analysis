My nerves are running high and I'm constantly close to having a panic attack and leaving to return home. \n\nThere are often days where I just can't bring myself to leave at all, and if I had even half-plans (I really try not to commit to things that involve going out) with my bf, he really struggles to not take it personally. He has said that he feels like I'm pushing him away and now, in his defensiveness, that he's doing the same. \n\nIt's really hard to deal with because I care so much about him but on the days where this happens are the days when I'm at my lowest and I find it difficult to support him because I'm struggling with myself so much. ): \n\nDoes anyone else have a similar issue? Any advice? \n\nTL;DR: some days I find it really hard to go out the house, even with my boyfriend, and he takes it badly. Help? ",

            "selftext": "This morning I had a panic attack for the first time in about 3 months. Having felt uneasy while doing my morning routine, I ignored it and went on with my morning. I stopped at a coffee shop for some joe and to get a little work done early. As I sipped my coffee and started to work on some homework I could feel the uneasiness grow. Fearing the worst I went into the restroom and splashed water on my face. I went back out and didn't feel any better, so I popped a Lorazepam. Well I guess the fear needed my emergency pills finally pushed me over the edge and a full on panic attack ensued.\n\n\nI tired to talk to myself and took deep breathes. Eventually I was able to calm down enough to drive back home. I went straight to bed and watched TV and kept trying to talk myself down. Luckily, I have a weekly meeting with a therapist and it happened to be today in the morning. So I was able to work it out with him. I felt much better.\n\n\nMy last panic attack triggered a week long depression where I was unable to get out of bed. I was very worried this would happen again. Luckily there have been no signs of such a reaction, considering I've gone to work today with no problems. \n\n\nI just wanted to share my little victory today in overcoming and controlling my anxiety. Thanks for reading!\n\n",

Typically this happens whenever I get yelled at by someone about anything I did/didn't do. It does not matter who it is, or if I actually did something wrong or not. Basically I can feel my heart rate rise, I get an instant headache which is usually followed by difficulty with breathing/talking. Often I feel a weird kind of pressure on my chest as well and by that time I can already feel the tears. Sometimes I make it out of the room without crying, sometimes I don't, which is pretty embarrassing, especially at work.\n\nHas anyone ever dealt with anything like that? Did you learn to control it? I really don't know what to do about this and am very thankful for any advice.   \n\nThanks for taking the time to read this, and I'm really sorry for spelling/grammar mistakes (english isn't my native language). \n\n\nEdit: Wow, I really didn't expect so many comments when I wrote this.

It just makes my stomach churn. \n\nRight now I'm trying to apply to places on a cycle. Two a day, then one a day, then two a day. Today I need to apply to two places.

            "selftext": "I was watching the last episode of Courage the Cowardly Dog (Season 4, Episode 13, Part 2) last night. It's about Courage's struggle with being imperfect. His mind creates a perfect teacher to instruct him in being perfect, but he does everything imperfectly. His teacher scolds him and tells him that if he does not become perfect, there will be consequences. He worries about it so much that he has nightmares about how being imperfect will ruin everything he cares about.\n\n\nBut then, at the end, before his \"final exam\" in perfection, a fish tells him in a calm and accepting tone, \"There's no such thing as perfect. You're beautiful as you are, Courage. With all your imperfections, you can do anything.\"\n\n\nThis was a really good reminder to me. Many people worry about being imperfect. It's one of my main worries when I interact with others or do things that are new (or in a lot of cases, familiar) to me. It was really reassuring, and I hope others reading this will feel reassured as well. It's okay to be imperfect.",

            "selftext": "I have an anxiety story to share with you all.\n\nI have suffered with anxiety, predominantly health anxiety, for the better part of ten years. Both my parents died suddenly and traumatically, which left me with some huge emotional issues that I've found hard to keep under control.\n\nBack in December I noticed some brown marks on my lady parts. I asked my fianc\u00e9 about them - he said I'd had them for years. I didn't remember seeing them before. I completely freaked out, as is typical for me when anything health-related is concerned. I researched like crazy - melanoma, melanoma, melanoma. I was utterly convinced. And terrified.\n\nI went to see my GP who said she wasn't concerned but she could see that I was - so she wrote to the dermatologist for me. The dermatologist suggested I come in to be examined. This had me thinking that this was proof I was absolutely definitely ill. \"Why would she have referred me if that wasn't the case??\" I asked of the people around me again and again. I had my fianc\u00e9 checking every mole, every spot. I had him checking these spots daily to make sure they hadn't changed. Sex life? Absolutely not, not when I had cancer. There were days at a time that I didn't get out of bed. I couldn't eat, I couldn't sleep - when I did I had disturbing nightmares. I stopped going to work. I even started considering a quick marriage so I would have the chance to do it 'before... I die'. My life pretty much came to a halt.\n\nSo, today the day had come for the dermatologist's appointment and I almost didn't go, I was so terrified. My friend practically frog-marched me into the room. And guess what? Freckles. Fucking freckles. That's what the past two months of misery had been all about. Fucking freckles. They didn't even need to a test.\n\nBut of course, it isn't about the freckles, it never was. It's about the anxiety. And now I've got to tackle that. It's the start of a long journey. I'm sure there will be many more health 'scares' on the way. But I've got to get better. Because who wants to live their life frightened of freckles?\n\nTL;DR: I'm scared of freckles. I need to sort this shit out once and for all.",
