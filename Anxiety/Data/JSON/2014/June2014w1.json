I am triggered EACH time by these noises, then I am filled with total emotional dread and panic. \n\nDuring childhood my parents would frequently argue every week, almost every night. My dad was very a tumultuous, angry person. When my mother was angry she'd throw cups and plates to break them, she'd slam doors and cabinets, she'd throw the dirty dishes into the sink (classical housewife at the time). \n\nI've tried to peacefully suggest to her to not do this because it triggers me.

            "selftext": "Hello everybody! Been reading this sub for a while now and thought I would share one of the things that has helped me the most with my anxiety and depression. I am 24 and have had anxiety and major depressive disorder since I was 14, so I have a solid decade worth of experience! Yay.\n\nI have done psychotherapy for four years, and also use an SSRI; this tip is more of a complement to those things, not really a stand-alone solution.\n\nIt's pretty simple: get out of the house/apartment/dorm two times each day. Sounds easy, right? Not always. During my darkest bouts of anxiety, I get scared of the world and just sit in a corner of my apartment. But with this rule, I have to at least try to go out twice a day. Once might be for a trip to the coffee shop and post office, then later on for a 20 minute jog. On days that I work, going in to the lab counts as one, then taking an evening bike ride or making a visit to the flower shop counts as another. It's afternoon here right now and I have already been to the cafe, farmer's market, and flower shop, and I am planning a run to a park or a yoga class for the evening.\n\nAnything can count! Laundromat? Great, you got up and got out! Went to the pharmacy for prescription refills and new shampoo? Awesome!  It might sound dumb, but I really think it is a good strategy. Getting outside helps you interact with others and can sometimes make you forgot your anxieties for a few minutes. At the very least, you will get some vitamin D from the sunlight, and that never hurt anybody. You can also make new friends this way.\n\nI live in a nice cozy neighborhood in NYC, so I know it is easier for me than for those of you who might live in rural areas. But just try- even if you are only taking the dog for a walk around the house.\n\nHope this helps some of you!",

My heart rate started going up and my chest felt warm and tight. I was up until 7:30 am and finally fell asleep for a couple of hours. When I woke up I felt a little better so I carried on with my day.\n\nSo I went through out yesterday I feeling okay but not perfect, something was off, around 4:00pm my heart rate started speeding up again and my chest was warm and my hands were tingly and I was so sure I was having a heart attack. (I'm a 20 year old girl, probably not having a heart attack).\n\nMy boyfriend drove me to urgent care, they did an EKG on me and took my vitals, my heart rate was 130(normal 60-80) and my breaths per minute were 18 (normal 12). Everything else about me seemed healthy but they didn't know why my heart rate was so fast so they sent me to the ER to get blood tests done.\n\nWhen I got to the ER my heart rate was down to 118. The blood tests all came back perfect. They said I looked to be in perfect health. The doctor talked to me and said his personal opinion is that I was having an anxiety attack but that they don't diagnose that there because they didn't have an official way to test for it. \n\nI already had suspicions that I had some form of an anxiety disorder but have never experienced something like that. After doing some research after getting home I discovered a lot of other people have had experiences like that. So, here I am, that's been the last 48 hours for me, and I guess now I don't have any excuses to ignore my mental health. \n\nThe last 12 hours of reading over this subreddit has been so incredibly comforting and helpful, so thank you. \n",

I have anxiety people think im a twig and I'm small. \n\nWith every new thing I do comes new anxiety.\n\nI started self-studying astrophysics  now im scared I'm just a small small small human in a vast cosmos of zero significance. \n\nIm scared to learn,  and scared to not learn. \n\nDamned if I do Damned if I dont for everything.\n\nAnd this became a rant quickly......... \n\nSorry for that.",

            "selftext": "I'm different.\nNot necessarily in a good way.\n\t\nI overreact to making mistakes, assuming that the worst will happen. Sometimes I obsessively think about bad things happening to me and start chasing those bad thoughts until I'm exhausted from thinking &amp; crying. Sometimes my head feels wrong, like my brain is trying to hurt me. I can feel the anxiety pouring out of my brain in chemicals, but I don't know how to distract myself from it. I worry when I notice strangers looking at me, so I've just started not looking anyone in the eye. I like my clothes and know they make me more comfortable, but I constantly worry that I look strange. I'm always worried that people can see my thoughts are different. That I'm scared or uncomfortable. Sometimes I second guess things that are real. I find myself worrying about how true something is, or if something is really there or if I'm actually dead or in a coma at that very moment. I want this traffic jam in my head to stop completely but I don't have any idea how.\n\nI can't concentrate on anything. Not even videogames anymore. I can't sit down with something &amp; do it for hours except reddit, which only encourages you to continually entertain your brain with new information. I rarely finish books. I buy clutter all the time and it's all taken over my room. It's so disorganized in here that it's almost distracting. I want to clean it but I feel powerless. I don't know why. It's like a reflection of what's in my head and I hate it. I haven't completed a videogame in years. Not since Pokemon Platinum, I think, which was about five years ago now. I just spend all my time on reddit. I spend so much time on the computer that I forget to eat. I've always had this problem, even when I was in elementary school. I might be addicted to escaping from my own life, who knows?\n\nI feel so powerless and defeated. Everything in my life is so difficult to deal with and sometimes I think it would be better to just go off alone and never return so I can stop being such a burden to all these people who love me. I have no idea why people like me. I guess cause I'm quiet? I don't know. Do they even know anything about me? I try not to talk about myself &amp; my problems, cause I know they don't fucking matter. Who the hell would care about my problems? They can't fix them. Life is so hard. I need to find a better job in order to pay for school so I can get a degree and get a better job so I can make money to take care of myself. 20s sucks. Who the hell would hire me anyway? I love working hard, I really do. It's gratifying in a way that the rest of my life isn't. It's clear cut with clear instructions and rules. But my social skills are so poor that I don't think I could ever get someone to hire me.\n\nI'm afraid of strangers. I'm afraid of being in public. I'm afraid of getting unwanted attention. I'm afraid of being hit on or complimented. Being complimented makes me so uncomfortable most of the time. I'm afraid that I might be rude to someone on accident or somehow embarrass myself. I can barely make orders at fast food places and then I end up embarrassing myself and then my next hour or two is ruined cause all I can think about is how I requested a large when the sandwiches only come in one fucking size. After I'm comfortable in a place around people I have no problem with any of it, but I still find it hard to open up. I'm never going to be  confident enough to ask my closest friends to use third person pronouns with me because I worry they'll belittle me or ask me questions I don't have answers to.\n\nI'm uncomfortable in my own skin. I don't think I'm worth shit. I'm not worth loving or being around or talking to. I don't know why. I've been thinking about it for months and I can't figure it out and it hurts. It all hurts. I feel like if I tell anyone about my problems I'll be made fun of or not taken seriously or belittled or what if I just start crying while I try to tell them about myself? That would be so embarrassing that I just can't do it. I bottle it all up and can't do it. I can't even talk to my therapist about my problems even though I know he just wants to help. I don't think any of this is normal and it scares me. I've put myself into a god damn panic attack just writing all of this down and it hurts it hurts and I can feel my brain screaming and I don't want to stop it because I've never even written all of this out before but at the same time I want it to stop cause it hurts in the weirdest way possible.\n\nI don't know how to fix this and I'm too scared to ask to go to a doctor because my mom would just be like \u201cReally? Do you really need to go to the doctor because I don't have any money. You think you have mental health problems? Isn't that why we got you a therapist? You should stop seeing him is you're not getting better. Yeah, sure, make the appointment yourself, but I'm so unhappy about you asking me for help that I'm just going to rub my indignation in your face for a while. I couldn't care less if you were happy or not because I sure as hell hate my life.\u201d\n\nSo. I don't know what to do. I'm just putting all this out there. I guess I'm just looking for opinions and advice. I need help.",

I felt foreign in my on skin. \nMy arms and legs started shaking \nFollowed by retching (I thought I did a pretty good job not getting sick) (I usually choke on my sick, it's like my lungs collapse)\nMy heart rate increased, \nMy thoughts ...I can't even explain, I found myself mumbling random words from shampoo bottles just to...get the voice/me back in my head?  \nMy breathing was manual,\nThe sweat pored off me as if I just jumped out of the shower. I didn't know the body could sweat so much in such a short period.  \n\nI'm back in bed now because I feel as if I had a adrenaline rush. I am tired despite my full nights sleep. I'm just going to chill out now and think. If you guys have any tips or tricks please inform me. :) I'm going to my general practitioners to see what they can do for me. They'd try me on meds which I don't want. Do they help? Because I'd imagine by the time I took a dose it would be over or I would vomit. \n\nThis is all new to me. I have been nervous and anxious in the past but this time I felt violated. This is unlike your first kiss, unlike a job interview,  unlike sex, unlike the near death experiences on drugs - it felt worse.  \n",

            "selftext": "INTRO \n\nI have been dealing with this \"foggy head\" thing for 5 years.  I have started to piece together what works and what doesn't and I think I am making progress.\n\nPROBLEM\n\nI really think that something happened that has made my nervous system completely over-stimulated, over-sensitized and completely fried. Some trigger (either mental pressure, like an anxiety/panic attack or physical like a workout) that caused my nervous system to freak out and remain out of whack since.\n\nThis \"foggy head\" thing has zapped my ability to dream, my motivation to do things, my attention span, my ability to critically think, make choices quickly and make decisions that I am \"at peace with.\" I am constantly analyzing, reflecting and re-analyzing.  It has also has taken my ability to be excited and happy about anything (but I still retain Joy, as I think that is spiritual).\n\nI just wanted (and still do) to go back to \"the way I was.\" \n\nPlease... in this lifetime!\n\nAt first, this completely paralyzed my life. But, at least for the time being, with prayer, this subreddit (knowing I am not alone!) and experimenting (because the Dr's weren't helpful much), I have started to adjust to life with this issue. I will beat this one day.\n\nCAUSE\n\nI'm convinced that the culprit in this plot is my nervous system, caused by anxiety, and that same nervous system makes all of my muscles tighten and my body super tense, including my head and neck.\n\nI have no proof, but I think the muscles are tightening around the nerves in my neck and aggregates the system even further.\n\nAnyway, this \"body-wide tension\" creates a domino affect and causes me to bite down on my teeth. This jaw tightening is what causes the specific muscles in my scalp to tighten even more. \n\nI truly believe that this head tension is what is causing my mind to think like sludge. I can't think of things quickly and feels like I am in a brain fog. \n\nAs I said, I think anxiety is the root cause. Then the frustration of this whole situation just causes even more anxiety, and it just builds.\n\nSOLUTION\n\nSo how do you get the nervous system desensitized? I don't know, but as I stated above, I think anxiety is the cause of all of this (hence me posting here). So as I have tried to identify and reduced my anxiety triggers, that has helped in reducing the nervous system and subsequent tension.\n\n-Therapy. There seems to be a correlation in the high anxiety situation I faced in 2009 (close death in my family) and when all of this started. The anxiety caused irrational fears of things that a therapist/counselor helped me to identify and work through. This had the highest impact on the anxiety itself and was a turning point in my ability to live and fight through this.\n\n-Any physical stimulation, from the pulling out of the scalp, to a pin prick, to a pinch of the skin ANYWHERE on the body, causes my  nerves to calm, the head to clear, and the shoulders and body to relax, temporarily, for that duration.  I think that is why I have seen others say that acupuncture is helpful.\n\n-Caffeine tends to aggravate the nervous system even more.\n\n-Taking Naproxen seems to calm the nerves a little bit and think \"clearly\" for a few hours.\n\n-Having a dentist make a mold to wear and prevent teeth clenching helps to keep the jaw open and helps relax the head muscles a little bit. But this is just treating a symptom and not the root cause of the problem. \n\n-Reading the book \"Hope and Help for Your Nerves.\"  Of anything that I have read anywhere, this has come the closest to describing medically some of the issues I am facing, as well as the some practical solutions to calming the symptoms I was facing.\nhttp://www.amazon.com/Hope-Help-Nerves-Claire-Weekes/dp/0451167228/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1401631763&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=hope+and+help+for+your+nerves\n\nSo that is what I have so far.  Maybe this is helpful to you.  But any feedback or experience from others is helpful to me. Honestly, just typing this has been helpful.  Maybe one day, I don't have to make an account to post this.  But, I'm taking this one day at a time.  Thanks for listening.",

            "selftext": "I am an accountant. Today, I have to close out an audit. I haven't slept well in week, have woken up at 4:00am everyday and am exhausted. I also have Crohn's Disease, and this seems to have triggered a flair up. We are doing a ledger conversion and it is a three man shop. I am the Director.\n\nI took this job to get away from stress. I have had an anxiety disorder that has put me on disability twice in the last five years. I have two Xanax in my pill caddy in my pocket. I have been carrying them for months. I don't want to take them. I only use the Xanax XR to sleep, but it isn't getting me through the night.\n\nI hate this feeling. I need to rest.\n\n\n**EDIT**\n\nThe auditors left at 3:00 est. They went through two years of books, and found two errors. Not bad, considering I do the accounting, HR, IT, office management and procurement. The company tripled in size since I started, and do to anxiety about losing my job, I wouldn't ask my boss for help. I finally hired an AP clerk and a staff accountant. Of course, I still worry chronically. \n\nIf you never went through an audit, it is always a good idea to let them work through the adjustments before you ask what the adjustment to income will be. Instead, I checked in all day. It was up and down, and so was I. I couldn't eat.\n\nI took a long walk at lunch and the auditors and I spoke when I got back. They were very helpful and told me they would help me spin it to my boss on Monday; that I did an excellent job under difficult condition, that, and I have permanent solutions to fix the problems.\n\nI didn't take the Xanax. I need it to sleep because anxiety is what keeps me awake. Ambien makes me tired and tense, but doesn't let me sleep.\n\nI took this job because I wanted out of the corporate world. I had a corner office on the 52nd floor, and a large staff. Then the panic attacks started. They got so bad, I would lock my office door, not take calls and try and hide. Of course, it cost me my job. I found another, higher paying, higher pressure job. I didn't last a year.\n\nI took this small job at a small company to avoid the pressure of being in upper management, pressure I know I can no longer endure. Also, my Crohn's was raising hell and became extremely hard to manage.\n\nI feel weak when this happens. The panic attacks started around five years ago. I used to thrive under pressure, and now I wilt. I will get through this without a knick, but sitting at your desk, struggling to breath, is not the way I want to live.\n\nI have been in therapy for over seven years. The panic attacks started when I got comfortable enough with her to really start to talk about the childhood sexual and physical abuse I lived through. No repressed memories here. I never forgot.\n\nBut suddenly, I started feeling afraid of losing everything. Then my marriage failed, and lost everything. I remarried, and she is wonderful, but I can't relax enough to enjoy our life together.\n\nRight now, I am sitting in the living room with my wife an daughter, watching the tube, and I know, Sunday night, the night before I explain the problems to my boss, I will lay in bed sweating and trying not puke.\n\nI am 51 years old, sober 30 years in AA, have three degrees and feel like a total asswipe most of the time. Even when my career was successful, I always thought that if any of my team could look into my mind, they would be shocked at how much of what they saw was a facade.  ",

I'm scared to take public transportation and there's no where to work in walking distance so this car will mean I can finally get a job and start my life as an adult. \n\nI got my permit on my 16th birthday and I'm going to be turning 20 in September. I got my licence when I was 17. The problem is that I rarely drove because mom only had one car and she always had it and rarely let me borrow it. If she did let me drive it was at night and only to bring my boyfriend home or get coffee. She's been letting me drive a little more (I guess since she knows she'll be surprising me soon.) Driving makes me a wreck. Not to the point where I shouldn't be driving. I'm worse once I'm home, oddly enough. \n\nWhen on the road I second guess everything I do. I'm always so scared to mess up. I always drive the speed limit and I'm so careful turning. I follow the rules of the road obnoxiously perfect. For example, today I had to take my sister to the doctor. I was making a left at a busy intersection in my city. (I live 15 minutes from Manhattan. So it's crowded and busy.)  There were so many buses and cars going in all different directions. There were a few times I could have probably cut some people off. But I figure it's better safe than sorry and I just inched forward slowly and went when it was all clear. I looked over and some lady on the other side of the road was giving me one of the nastiest looks I've ever seen and shaking her head at me. I'm sorry I don't speed. I'm sorry I stop at stop signs. I'm sorry I wait until it's totally clear to go rather than cut people off. But I don't want to die or get pulled over. \n\nWhen I get home I'm always so nervous. Even after I've parked and have been inside safe for a while. I'm always scared the police will knock on my door and take my licence away. (I know that's insane. Please don't laugh.) I feel like I've done something wrong. Part of me feels like I'm not even allowed to drive. \n\nI feel bad and I feel scared and I feel like I did something wrong. \n\nI know once this car is officially mine I'll be expected to take myself everywhere. But I'm terrified. \n\nI sort of want to ask my mom for more driving lessons but they're expensive and I'll feel so embarrassed. \n\nI'm not a bad driver, honest. I just have anxiety. :/ \n\nOh, it's also probably worth mentioning that my [abusive] father was a corrections officer and that made me terrified of cops, correction officers, security guards, etc.",

This is kind of a new thing for me. \n\nI've never been under any illusions about the fact that my parents wouldn't live forever, but I always thought it would be a thing I'd have to deal with in my 50s or 60s. 40s at the earliest. Definitely not in my 20s. I'd have a wife, maybe kids of my own, some kind of bedrock under me to make it all easier.\n\nLast September my mother's liver and kidneys started to give out on her. She was 59. She spent the entire fall and most of December slowly dying, though we didn't realize it was that serious at the time. The doctors never made clear exactly how serious it was, but we were under the impression she'd have a few more years, at least, as long as she underwent regular dialysis. Then in late December, one morning she died. \n\nFirstly, and maybe this is a weird one and I don't know if anybody who hasn't lost a close family member or friend can relate, but a couple weeks before she died I had been visiting and we got in a fight. A stupid, pointless argument that I immediately regretted. She broke down and started crying. She'd been spending a lot of time in the hospital and was more or less confined to her house since the problems had started. She said my father and I were her only friends, and that she didn't want to die. Now that's all I can think about. I worry that I didn't do enough for her in her last weeks. I worry that I made things harder for her than they should have been. I'm worried that I made her life, in general, harder than it should have been. She always teased me about when she was going to get grandchildren, and now she never will. I go back over in my mind everything I can remember ever saying to her, and determine how much pain I might have caused her. Stupid things. Stupid, petty, brief arguments that we quickly moved past, but what if she didn't? What if I unintentionally said something that really hurt her in the last weeks? I can't stop worrying about this, and I don't know if this is my anxiety or what.\n\nOn top of that, now I'm also terrified that my father is going to die. I mean, of course he will some day, but he'll be 60 next month and all I can think about is that he'll be gone, too. I'm worried about it when I'm visiting him, or if we go out for lunch, or when I talk to him on the phone. He mentions he has to go get routine blood tests done for the doctor, and I worry about a bad result being returned. I worry every time I know he's driving. Does anybody have any advice on how to move past this? Every time I see him these things are thrust right in front of me, and I hate it. I want that to be over. I want to enjoy the time I have left, however long it is, with my remaining parent.",
