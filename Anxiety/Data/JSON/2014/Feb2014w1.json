I had a panic attack a few days ago and it triggered a bout of derealisation, and now I'm scared that I might just be crazy. I keep thinking that at any minute I'll start hallucinating voices and people/ghosty-things. Is this just a symptom of anxiety? I know 'fear of losing your mind/going crazy' is a symptom of anxiety, but do they mean the worries I'm having, is being scared of becoming psychotic what they mean by that? \n\nEdit: Thanks everyone for answering. I feel a lot calmer now, and i hope some of you do too. It clearly is a symptom of anxiety. Reading your answers, and reading a couple of self-help books (At Last a Life, by Paul David &amp; The Happiness Trap by Russ Harris: these really help me, and i just had to go back for a crash-course refresher to remember what i've learned over the past few months) have really helped me feel OK today. My anxiety has been improving recently, sometimes I just slip back. When you slip back guys, go back to the things that helped in the past - this is what i learned today. Thanks again :-)",

So it's been almost a year. The thing is is that I have MAJOR anxiety about working. I tell myself that I'll fuck up in a new workplace, that I won't do good, that people will laugh at me for being nervous, that I'll have a huge panic attack and everyone will think I'm a psycho, etc. I already have it in my head that I will fail.\n\nI have an opportunity for a full time job. I've never had a full time job but I have worked 30-40 hours a week before. This is a pretty easy job but I'm frightened of failure. I also lack support from my family. They have no idea how to support anyone with a problem, and I don't have many friends either. So how can I better deal with my anxiety about working? Thanks.",

            "selftext": "Tips &amp; Tricks for Sleeping\n\nThese are some suggestions from members and other people with anxiety about overcoming difficulties sleeping. \n\n\u2022 Turn the clock so you cannot see the time when you are lying in bed. It can make you more anxious to keep checking what time it is to wake up in the night and know the hour.\n\n\u2022 Use a relaxation technique. I use the one where you start at the toes and progressively relax each muscle. Don\u2019t forget the face muscles.\n\n\u2022 Have a warm drink. Chamomile tea is a good relaxant. Or have a warm bath.\n\n\u2022 Avoid taking naps during the day because it can make it harder to go to sleep at night. I try to go for a 20-30 minute walk during the day.\n\n\u2022 Read in bed for a little while, it helps to turn off the mind-chatter. Some say that bed should only be associated with sleeping, and that reading or watching TV can over stimulate making sleep difficult.\n\n\u2022 I used to go to bed and endlessly churn things over in my head, tossing and turning. I then developed a routine that has become automatic now and I rarely have trouble sleeping. I go to bed and lie on one side \u2013 my \u2018\u2019thinking side\u2019\u2019. I process my day, running through what I have done etc and I am not allowed to beat myself up about anything. I can resolve to do something better but that is all. I then briefly run through what I am doing the next day. When I have done that I roll over to my \u2018\u2019sleeping side\u2019\u2019 and I am asleep in minutes. If I can\u2019t resolve something I get up and write it down.\n\n\u2022 I always keep pen and paper beside the bed so I can write down thoughts or worries, and then if I think them again I tell myself that I have written them down and will deal with them in the morning. It is also good for recording dreams.\n\n\u2022 I deal with my thinking about an hour before bed, and then I decide that I will sleep because the thoughts are taken care of.",

Unconditionally.    \nI know things have been hard since I moved away and I would give anything to fly back home and help you through everything you're going through. It breaks my heart to know you feel alone and I want you to know that though I may not be there in person, I will always be there. Period. You mean more to me than you'll ever know and having you as a sister and a best friend is truly a bigger blessing than I could ever ask for. We grew up together side by side and the best moments of laughter I have ever shared was with you. I could never truly articulate how thankful I am to have you around through good times and bad times.    \n\nSecondly, You need to know that you are beautiful inside and out. You're caring and kind. You may not see it but you bring so much joy to those around you. Your beautiful smile would brighten anyone's day. All I can ask is that through these times, please don't stop smiling. Keep your head up and your thoughts positive please. There is always and end to troublesome times when you stay positive. Don't be too proud to talk to someone when you need to, because that will help more than you could ever imagine. Whatever the future holds, I know that we'll be in it together.

I'm tuning back and forth between this world and the next and all i want is for my fucking endogenous opioids to drive a wall between me and my physiology: science, chemistry - whatever you call it.\n\nOver a minute i check my pulse - 68bm. Not bad not bad. I'm tuning back in. 12 minutes pass by, and my stomach declenches. It aches, but not so painfully as before.\n\n5 further minutes - repulse. 56bpm. Good. You're back at resting. Thank the gods. My heart aint beating a notch inside my ribs and Im not swallowing dry fear. Its better.\n\nI know i'm not perfect. I know I have failed things before due to performance anxiety, generalised anxiety and fear. Life ain't meant to be a cakewalk. It's just about finding out your own weakness and making yourself fit around them - ease between those supposedly insurmountable odds. And then getting through to the other side a-okay. it's all gonna be fine. You're stronger than you know.",

Usually fear and annoyance at people judging me or taking advantage of my help. I think it's a projection of my insecurity and dissatisfaction with myself. Whenever it happens I always wonder if the people I'm thinking of are just shitty people to stay away from or if it's all in my head. And that bothers me most of all - I feel like I have an inability to discern inappropriate interactions from normal ones. \n\nSo what do you find works better for you, trusting your gut/anxiety and cutting these people out, or assuming that these thoughts are just overly paranoid and ignoring them?",

            "selftext": "This is more of a rant than anything, but I would like some feedback on how others handle panic attacks either in places like class or in public in general.\n\nI've had small panic attacks in public before, but I feel lucky to not have a huge one like this until now. I'm a 17 year old female, turning 18 in August, who has had a history of mild anxiety throughout my life. It's gotten considerably worse within the last year, and this was the final straw for me.\n\nWe have 7 periods in a full class day, and I was near the end of my 6th period. Everything suddenly started to get really, really bright. After that, I started to feel increasingly more warm. Eventually, I was sweating a little bit. Considering the air conditioning was on and my jacket was off, this was really weird.\n\nWhen the bell rang, one of my friends noticed I didn't feel good and felt my head. She said I felt really, really warm and walked down to the nurse's office with me to get my temperature taken. I did take my temperature, but it was normal (98F, I believe that's 36C) so I went to my next period.\n\nOn the way to my next period I started to get noticeably dizzy. The hallway seemed to be spinning. I had great difficulty walking up the stairs because my legs seemed to be feeling heavier and heavier with each step.\n\nI didn't think it could get any brighter in my next period... boy, was I wrong. It hurt to look in one place for more than a few seconds. My head was spinning (as was the room, slightly) and I felt my legs become more numb.\n\nI noticed a guy in one of the other rows looking straight at me. He mouthed, \"You look sick.\" I mouthed back, \"I FEEL sick.\"\n\n(At this point, my memory is hazy, so I apologize if I'm not terribly detailed on this.)\n\nSuddenly, a huge pain jolted in my head. I slumped over in the chair. The boy that said I looked sick yelled to the teacher as soon as I did that. My vision was blurry, and I had sort of a black frame around the edges of my vision. From what I remember, the teacher looked horrified. (I later discovered it was the first time she had this happen, and she was actually horrified.) The only thing she asked was that if I could make it to the office by myself. At this point I couldn't feel my legs, so I mouthed (I couldn't find my words for some reason) \"Probably not.\"\n\nShe got another girl a row behind the boy to take me out into the hall. My teacher got another teacher who didn't have a class to walk me to the nurse's office. It was hard to walk, my legs felt like lead whenever I moved them. It didn't help that I felt like I was overheating, either, even though I knew I wasn't.\n\nI sat on the couch in the nurse's office taking deep breaths and dabbing a wet paper towel on my face. Eventually, I started to feel calmer and was able to go about my business again.\n\nThe weirdest part about this whole experience was that there wasn't any trigger. I had no reason to be nervous. It just happened, no warning, nothing. I also feel lucky to have had supportive friends during that, as some came down after school had ended to see how I was doing. It was humiliating, because a good amount of my classmates saw me at a weaker point, despite me being known for being positive even in negative situations. I was worried some people would think I was just being a drama queen, because I know with people my age that if you do not have problems with anxiety then you probably will not understand it when it happens to others and just read it off as being dramatic.\n\nI'd like to hear some experiences you guys have had with panic attacks in public. Have you guys ever had a rather big one like mine? What did you do? I want to prevent a future one in any way I can, so any advice on helping that would also be a huge plus.\n\nEither way, thank you for reading my rant. I feel so much better getting this out.",
