            "selftext": "I've had garden variety generalized anxiety my whole life, with a couple of specific phobias thrown in. This kind of thing has never happened to me before, and I'm trying to understand what is going on. \n\nWhenever I'm anxious, but there's a chance to blame my husband for the anxiety-provoking situation, I direct my anxiety toward him in the form of anger. For example, we were going on a road trip through the mountains, and two days beforehand I learned it was going to be incredibly snowy, and we would need tire chains to get across the mountain passes. I freaked out and started yelling at him for changing our road trip plans to take us through the mountains instead of along the California coast, where it wouldn't be snowy. I had wanted to go through California, and he wanted to go through the mountains so we could go skiing. I had been totally on board with that plan until I learned the weather was going to be bad. \n\nAnother example: I get anxious about his relationship with a female friend, even though there is rationally nothing at all to be threatened by (she's in a happy marriage, and so are we.). But I get mad at him constantly over the content of their conversations, even though he isn't doing anything I didn't already told him it is okay to do (all he does is text her). It's incredibly irrational (you have to just trust me that he hasn't done *anything* to betray my trust or cause me to be worried). But instead of just being anxious, because that's all I really feel, I get very angry at him, and say really terrible accusatory things. When I look back on it, I feel very terribly guilty for being angry, when I really was just anxious. \n\nIs this a common thing? How do people deal with it? I DO NOT want to go back to avoiding the things I'm afraid of. I don't want to be the kind of person who restricts her husband's other relationships out of fear. But it hurts him for me to be mad at him all the time, and I have to stop it, but I don't know how, since, once I calm down, I realize that I'm not mad at him, I'm just anxious. ",

That's actually pretty normal for a lot of people... But, that doesn't mean you have an actual anxiety disorder.\n\nHaving an anxiety disorder is not just being \"a little bit nervous.\" Having an anxiety disorder is being so damned nervous that you start manifesting ticks, tremors, shaking, stuttering or other obsessive behaviour. \n\nHaving an anxiety disorder is not \"butterflies in your stomach.\" Having an anxiety disorder is \"A giant, rabid and angry honey-badger in your stomach.\"\n\nHaving an anxiety disorder is not \"Whoops, I forgot to give this cute person my number. I'm such a dummy.\" Having an anxiety disorder is \"You stupid fucking moron, you should never have gone out to socialize at all because you can't even get this one simple social thing right by giving that cute person your number.\"\n\nIt does not make you \"Cute\" or \"Quirky\" to be all \"lol, I'm a little bit anxious because I have an anxiety disorder.\" In fact, it's kinda insulting because you are trying to use it to make yourself feel special and by doing so you are minimizing and dismissing what those of us that have it face on a daily basis.\n\nIt's not cute...

            "selftext": "Last friday night I went out with two other friends to a club. We drank a couple of beers, we had a table to ourselves. Everything was going great, until somebody had the idea to change clubs.\n\nWe all agreed and went to this other place, which was packed. It was like being forced to go into a swimming pool full of people. I went in there and before I knew it, all my friends were just ... gone. I was alone. With everybody else. Staring at me, watching me, dancing around me. I couldn't breathe. People were all turning to watch me panic, watch me bleed on the inside. I felt like in the \"Invasion of the Body Snatchers\", except that I wished somebody could just turn me into one of them, and be rid of this fucking feeling of dread, of fearing all my actions.\n\nI turned around and I went home. I didn' tell anyone. I just went home and got into my apartment, in my bed, under my sheets, nobody to fear. It was all OK again... until a few hours ago.\n\nSame thing as last week. Went to the same club with two of friends, had a few beers, had a table to ourselves. All OK. The guy with last week's idea to change clubs was not there. I felt safe again. But there was this other guy with us who liked to talk to random women, which I could never understand. He noticed two of them sitting down to the table right next to us. He went in for the kill.\n\n&gt; Could we join your table?\n\n&gt; Sure!\n\nThey joined. They both looked at me and told me to follow suit.\n\nThe music was loud. I was sitting between them. They were both busy talking to them, they were pretty responsive, but not really (in my opinion). I was sipping my beer like it was water in the desert. I was the third wheel. I wanted out. I wanted to run again. My friend to my right goes to the bathroom. My friend to my left is deep in conversation with one of the girls. She's smiling. I'm not. I look at the girl on right my other friend left behind. She doesn't even notice me. She's checking her phone every 5 seconds. I notice that her hand is in a cast:\n\n&gt; What happened?\n\n&gt; Gym accident.\n\n&gt; How did you manage that?\n\n&gt; I have no idea.\n\n&gt; How come?\n\n&gt; It just happened\n\nReally? You have no idea? I broke my arm when I was 6 and I still remember every detail. I remember the pain, I remember the worry, my parents' reaction.\n\nI told her about my cast.\n\n&gt; ... Except mine wasn't all signed like yours.\n\nHers was signed. All over. She smiled and checked her phone again, her smile fading as soon as her eyes touched the screen. My friend comes back. Their conversation continues. I'm alone again. I just had  conversation with a stranger for the first time in years.\n\nNot a great one, but a conversation nonetheless. I tell my friend I'm hungry, and that I'll be right back. I grab my jacket and fly out of there, I go home. I never went back. Now I'm in my bed again, under my sheets and I don't think I can take another failure, another disapointment, another person with a fully signed cast checking their phone and ignoring me just because they don't care ... And why should she care? She didn't ask to sit with me. She doesn't have to do anything, really. She has her choice and she does as she pleases. And that goes for every woman out there. We're just clowns putting on a show and the funniest clown wins. That's how it feels, anyway.\n\nSorry for the long rant, but this will probably help me sleep better tonight.\n\nThanks...",

The temperature went down to -20C and I found myself in my apartment alone, talking to myself. I had a job offer, but it was withdrawn, so I live on the money I was given by my parents at Christmas (plenty for the next few months on a tight budget). I am in a foreign country (they all are) and do not really speak the language here. I never know if I should speak Russian or Lithuanian, as I am in a Russian neighborhood in Vilnius, so I speak neither. I just utter basic phrases and avoid speaking to strangers. \n\n---\n\n\nWhen I go out I feel everywhere is too busy. I used to live in London... it was bad. I discovered that I cannot take public transport without feeling extremely uncomfortable. I have learned to tolerate a crowd for a couple of hours... but the tension grows and then it is completely unbearable. I can handle it, but need to get away and relax... Go to a private space and talk aloud to myself... \n\n\n---\nA few years ago I found cycling as a good way to get around. You don't have to sit awkwardly in a packed bus and bite your tongue... your personal space is larger when you ride, and cars aren't the same as people. Because of the snow I have been off my wheels, so no exercise and not getting around much. \n\n---\n\nI go out to the woods locally, and talk aloud... I need these open places so much. \n\n---\n\n\nAlcohol is how I am able to go to a crowded place and not be socially awkward... but then I behave drunkenly and I have had to stop drinking so much for my health. \n\n---\nSorry that this is so egotistical and self-centered... thanks for reading this. I just had a bad day today... I tried to go somewhere to see a mate, but felt funny. I tried to go to the bus station and take the trolleybus, but failed. I failed to get on a bus. I was thinking, \"I knew I should have cycled.\" \n\n---\nSo now I have a few beers and am going to spend the rest of my day alone with my guitar and computer. This is where I want to be... \n\n\n\n",

            "selftext": "As someone who has suffered from severe anxiety in one form or another on a daily basis ever since I hit puberty, I\u2019m curious to know what other anxiety-sufferers do when they\u2019re feeling especially anxious and want to try to calm down and relax ASAP.  The obvious answer is immediate-acting anti-anxiety meds (benzodiazepines) such as Klonopin, Xanax etc but I\u2019ve found I still have problems with anxiety even after taking the benzo I\u2019m prescribed (Klonopin), even if it does somewhat diminish my anxiety and take the edge off of things.  The second obvious answer is alcohol but personally I\u2019ve found that about 20% of the time it makes things marginally better and the other 80% of the time it makes my anxiety and general sanity/emotional well-being *significantly* worse; this has all been whilst drinking alone though...social drinking is an entirely different animal which I\u2019ve found has a much higher success rate the few times I\u2019ve done it.\n\nSo what are some other methods or techniques you guys find useful for instant anxiety relief?  I\u2019m not looking for long-term solutions like therapy, SSRIs, or other things that typically take weeks or months to see benefits from, as I\u2019ve tried many of these already with mixed results and am really just looking for ideas to alleviate or lessen anxiety right away while it\u2019s actually happening.\nSo far some of my solutions are ASMR videos, such as these:\n\n#1: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RVpfHgC3ye0\n#2: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6UrUsduW4FA\n#3: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2g9e2ner9sE\n#4: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv4BOmjRids\n\n*(Also head over to /r/asmr for many more videos like this)*\n\nAlso, particularly soothing music seems to help as well \u2013 [this track](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CySNhHVAokQ) in particular is [claimed by scientists to be the \u201cmost relaxing song ever\u201d](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/8830066/Band-creates-the-most-relaxing-tune-ever.html) and, according to [the Wikipedia article](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marconi_Union#Weightless), \u201cit induced a 65% reduction in overall anxiety and brought test subjects' resting pulse rates to 35% of their usual resting rates.\"\n\nTwo albums also come to mind; [\u201cDive\u201d by Tycho](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dive_%28Tycho_album%29) and [\u201cBlack Sands\u201d by Bonobo](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_sands).\n\nAfter playing these videos and songs on a daily basis for years I\u2019ve found I\u2019ve become rather desensitized to them unfortunately, but they do still help a little (and hopefully will better help others out there just discovering them for the first time).  \n\nIn addition, I find lighting candles, turning the heat up, and drinking certain kinds of tea to also help somewhat.  Oh, and scalp massagers, too\u2026for those of you who don\u2019t know, it\u2019s [these things](http://i.imgur.com/RBOv9db.jpg).\n\nSo those are a few of my semi-solutions, but I\u2019m very interested in hearing from the rest of you.  Be they songs or albums that relax you, massage or relaxation tools/devices, types of tea, or any other thing, technique, product or method that reduces or alleviates your anxiety right away...what\u2019s worked the best for you?",

I'm looking for support and I have found that here from you guys in the past. \n\nI have been sick for a long time with everything getting progressively worse. I have extremely bad (clinically diagnosed) anxiety and PTSD. I know that I can be a hypochondriac but I also know my body and I know when there is something wrong. \n\nThe truth is, I want so badly to be diagnosed with something other than mental illness because then people will believe me when I say \"I'm sick.\". If I had a physical illness then maybe my friends and family and job won't question my integrity just because I have good days. \n\nI've seen doctor after doctor, tracking symptoms that may very well be my anxiety manifesting itself. I don't even know what's real anymore. I'm in too deep though. I'm on disability, I've lost my job. Nobody believes me. I don't believe me anymore. I can't tell whether others have convinced me that it's all in my head or if it really is. I want to be validated for once. \n\nI saw my doctor **again** today and demanded that I be tested for issues I am convinced I have. My doctor tried to humor me by giving my samples of some meds which I know are placebo doses. Then she did an ultrasound on my thyroid. Now she's ordered an urgent MRI because my lymph-nodes are not normal. Cancer runs ALLL through my family and this is exactly how doctors diagnosed it. She made it clear that this could be serious *but* I need to rest well knowing that we know nothing yet. \n\nNow that something might seriously be wrong with me, I don't want there to be anything wrong with me. I've wished to have something to show to my boss, my friends, my SO, my mother for so long. Now I might just have it and I am at a loss. \n\nI don't know whether I even deserve to feel vindicated at this point. I am more confused about what is real than I ever have been and I can't admit that to anyone without looking like a complete asshole.\n\n\n\nTL;DR  I wished for illness and now that I may have it, I'm scared. \n\n\n",

I struggled quite a bit in college, especially in hard classes, my anxiety got out of control.\n\nLast year I was also diagnosed with lupus, and my flares are directly related to my anxiety. I have to utilize a lot of meditation techniques to keep them under control.\n\nAnyway, that's just some background. I am paralyzed with fear about next year. I have no earthly idea what I want to do with myself, or my life. I've watched job deadline after job deadline go by with a thousand yard stare.\n\nI don't know what to do.\n\nMy anxiety stems from my illness, and I don't have a great home life either. It would probably be in my best interest not to go back home (for an extended period of time) after I graduate.\n\nHelp :(",

            "selftext": "Hello guys,\n\nUgh. I'm terrified even writing this. I don't know what happened today at all.\n\nI'm going to keep this relatively short. I'm a little scared by how calmly I'm typing - I'm afraid I'm not getting across how scared I am. I'm semi in shock.\n\nShortish backstory - I'm 29, and have had severe panic disorder, depression, and ocd since I was eight. Been suicidal since sixteen. Also been sexually/emotionally abused, so having issues with that. I was in therapy for awhile, great therapy, and it helped so much. But my parents lost their insurance so I had to stop early. Extremely broke myself now, so I've been dealing on my own and trying free groups when I can (although I haven't in awhile - moved to an area away from the groups I was going to).\n\nOkay. Some relevant things about my panic, before I explain tonight. (Still worried it's not panic and something is extremely wrong with me.) I have ocd with health phobias (which my old therapist said was different from hypochondria). I get absolutely petrified when I'm sick. I'm especially scared of fainting, seizures, fevers, heart attacks, etc. I woke with a fever of 104 when I was eight, and have a massive fear of waking with a fever because of that. Also, my body temp fluctuates a lot, and lately I've been very fixated on taking my temp to calm myself and make sure I'm not sick. My temp tends to run low - around 97.6-98.1. During panic, it's gone down around to 95.4, or up to 100. Drives me crazy. I also get extremely weak in my panic, very dizzy, very faint (never actually fainted though), massive depersonlization, etc. Also tends to get triggered by pms and my period - I have low blood pressure, so doesn't help. Been having bad insomnia lately, too.\n\nUgh, this is long. I'm sorry, guys :( I'm just so out of it right now.\n\nSo I've had a tough few weeks, but was feeling relatively okay today. I had had to work while really sick with pms last night until around one am. Had to work today from ten am until around ten pm. I only slept from around four thirty to nine thirty last night. So I was tired. I ate a little more than normal (tend to avoid eating). Was kinda dizzy tonight, but thought I was mainly tired. My boyfriend came over for a bit, and we watched tv and relaxed. When he left, I ate some chocolate, realized I had just started my period and was happy because I was barely cramping, read a bit, and feel asleep around 3:15. \n\nIt's cold out, and stuff in my apartment, but I have a fan going. I was sleeping in just a t shirt, and under a few blankets. Was comfy. I had taken my temp before bed (I know I shouldn't so often :( ) and I was back down to 97.7 after being high for about a week due to pms (like I get every month - it normally goes back to normal soon after starting my period). I thought I felt calmer.\n\nThen around four, I woke up. I noticed I sweating on my neck. I seldom sweat. I was a bit confused but didn't think it was a huge deal. Soon I noticed I sweating everywhere -kinda soaked, for me at least. (I dunno if I was sweating that much at first, or if I got nervous when I noticed the sweat and then started sweating...) I tried to just go back to sleep...Kicked off one blanket (leaving a light blanket and as sheet on). I kept noticing how much sweat was on me. I started to freak out, thinking I woke up with a fever.\n\nI don't even remember clearly how the next steps went. I got up to go to the bathroom and try to calm down. I was so dizzy when I stood up - I felt like I was falling, like everything was fuzzy. I felt incredibly weak and so hot and just hysterical. I started sobbing and half screaming - I do that a lot with panic. These all are semi normal for me with panic - they just felt more intense (which I honestly didn't think was possible), and more, real, I guess? I was convinced I had a fever of like 105 and was dying. I was losing my mind.\n\nI typically, during panic, will sit on my bathroom floor and read or use my laptop, because the cool tile calms me and I can throw up if I have to, etc. I tried that. I just couldn't focus. I wanted to take my temp but got terrified it would be high. That made everything worse - I kept wandering my tiny apartment, freaking out and worrying I was going to fall. I got so scared I would pass out or get too weak that I ended up just crawling on my floor trying to distract myself, and crying and praying.\n\nI thought about hurting myself, but didn't. I got semi happy because I realized I wanna live, so that's something, I guess.\n\nI thought I was going to throw up, but didn't. This all went on for like fifteen minutes. I grabbed my phone and almost called my boyfriend, almost called an ambulance, tried to figure out who lives closest to me (I have no car, and live in a basement studio apartment in an old couple's house that i don't really associate with). \n\nI ended up passing a little gas, which made me feel a bit better. That often helps with my panic, so I started thinking maybe that's what was happening. (Before this, I was utterly, UTTERLY convinced it was medical. I usually worry it is, but this felt far more certain to me.) That convinced me to try to take my temp. I was mortified - I have a few cheap digital thermometers - some older than others. They're not that accurate - one is always giving me a reading of around .5 higher htan the other. Odd. Anyway, I used them both. I came up like 96.0 and 96.6. I felt a bit calmer, but worried I was going into hypothermia or something. I felt incredibly hot to the touch to me, but my hands tend to get extremely cold.\n\nI tried to get up and walk again, and still felt super weak. Finally, I ended up able to get my laptop and focus a bit on reading. I was looking up nighttime panic attacks. I've never woken up with one before - I started thinking that's what was happening.\n\nIs it possible that a panic attack is worse or seems more real when you wake up with it? That I was half asleep and not thinking clearly? Could I have just gotten a hot flash or something while sleeping, or panicked while sleeping (which has made my temp rise before - panic, just not during sleep that I know of, although I rarely get a bit sweaty while sleeping)? Is it not likely medical?\n\nI'm debating going to a clinic today to see a doctor to just try to get a referally to a cheap therapist or something. I'm currently petrified of sleeping, or of living alone (which I was already scared of). I'm also so so so so so so scared that it's not panic and something is wrong, and that I need an ambulance. Ugh. Although I guess I wouldn't be doing better? After the temp reading, I started shaking and having more of my usual panic symptoms. I'm calm enough now that I'm back in bed, under my blankets. I feel freezing but my face feels warm to my touch. My temp seems to be back around like 98.0, which would be better. I'm guessing that wouldn't improve if I were really sick?\n\nI'm so tired, and now I'm scared to even sleep :( My boyfriend comes back around nine this morning, so about two and half hours from now. Debating staying up until he gets here, skipping work, going to a clinic or something. I'm scared to, though. I'm afraid I need to go to a hospital for my panic or something, that I'm not able to live on my own right now.\n\nI just don't even know what's wrong with me. I hate being this way. So much. I'm so tired. I don't want to do this anymore at all :(\n\nThanks so much for any help. \n\nEDIT: wow, you guys, I can't think you enough. I ended up sleeping for around two hours, and my bf came over and made me drink some Gatorade and relax. Texted my best friend who was a psychology major, and she's positive it's panic and I'm okay. \n\nShe asked me to come over today, so I've been hanging out at her apartment and she's gonna have me sleep here tonight, since I'm really scared about sleeping alone in case it happens again. Been shaky and scared all day, but started to calm down. \n\nShe's also helping em try to sign up for Obama care, and she's going to help me find some therapy I can afford here. Apparently all my friend could tell my anxiety has been getting worse so they were of expecting.\n\nI can't thank you guys enough. Kindness from strangers is overwhelming. I always feel so weak and babyish when I'm scared of his stuff. I was just so convinced I was dying...ugh. You guys have made this day so much better :)",
