            "selftext": "For most of childhood, until the last year or so (I'm 28 now) I have lived with crippling fear and anxiety. I have probably spent in the $1000's on self-help books, programs, remedies and NOTHING worked. I was absolutely desperate for a quick fix, or anything that could help alleviate the symptoms that made my life hell. A simple task like going to the doctor or having to speak to a stranger would bring on a full blown panic attack. Job interview? Forget it. I didn't want to deal with anybody or anything, because I was terrified that something bad would happen. I can't even tell you how many amazing opportunities I missed out on, friends I lost and family that I've disappointed because of my condition. I tried a multitude of pharmaceutical drugs, none of which worked for me. I used to contemplate suicide on a daily basis and even once made an attempt to do so. Luckily I survived and I'm truly lucky to be here today, to share with you all how I've managed to completely turn my life around. Sure, I still deal with anxiety here and there, but after years of actively trying to help cure myself of this horrible disorder, I've found a personal regimen that has helped me tremendously.  I'm not trying to sell anything as most of these things can be done for little to no money.\n\n1.\tExercise Daily - This one is a must for me. Even if you can't afford a gym membership, get outside and go for a walk or a run. Create a routine of sit-ups, push-ups and squats that you can do for 30 mins in your bedroom every day. Working out daily has given me a sense of accomplishment and has helped my self image tremendously. I also feel that it helps me burn off energy, that would otherwise be used to fuel my anxiety.\n\n2.\tMeditation/Deep Breathing - I had a tough time with this one at first. I read a few books on the subject to learn how to do it properly, but just sitting there and concentrating on my breath while not trying to think about anything, sounded dumb. So I ended up searching online and finding a meditation group in my city that meets several times a week. At first, the thought of showing up to a meeting alone gave me a panic attack. I can't describe how terrified I was the first time I stepped into the class, but within 5 minutes of the session I already felt calm and super proud of myself for putting myself out of my comfort zone. I've met some amazing people in the group, I've learned how to properly meditate and most importantly I've learned some valuable lessons and tools on how to be truly happy and how to be in the present moment. I try to do two 20 minute meditations a day, but it's often just one. \n\n3.\tDiet - Some people can eat or drink whatever they want and feel very little consequences. Me on the other hand, I'm extremely sensitive to wheat, dairy and alcohol. If I go out on a Friday night with some friends and have 8-12 drinks I can almost guarantee I'll be extremely anxious and on the verge of a panic attack for the next few days. When I was younger, I would self-medicate with a ton of alcohol because I felt it was the only way I could mask my anxiety. Especially in social gatherings. It might have worked temporarily, but I'd be a drunken idiot followed by 2 days of crippling panic attacks. Now, I try to limit my drinks to 1 or 2 when I'm out with friends. As far as food goes, I follow the paleo-diet. Lots of fresh vegetables, protein &amp; healthy fats. This has helped me with the brain-fog symptoms that come with anxiety, more than anything else.\n\n4.\tVitamins - I know they can be expensive but if you can afford them, I highly suggest mega-dosing on vitamin D3. If you're already taking a multi-vitamin, I can almost guarantee you're still not getting enough D3 daily. I aim for 3000-4000mg iu's a day along with 3 250mg capsules of Magnesium citrate and a single 250mg calcium cap. Almost all North-Americans are defficient in D3, which plays an extremely important role in brain function. Magnesium is also plays a big role in helping keep the mind calm. I've found that it's helped with my sleep more than anything.\n\n5.\tSleep - Sleep is crucial to my mental health. I personally need 7-8 hours a night, or I don't feel right. Sometimes my anxiety would be so bad I wouldn't sleep for days. My personal record was no sleep for 5 days straight, which landed me in the hospital. But thats a story for another time :) Doing all of the above has helped keep me calm and I've been sleeping better than I have in years!\n\n6.\tGet out of your comfort zone - Force yourself to get out and spend time with your friends and family. Don't constantly turn plans down, to sit in your room and play video games like I used to do. If your anxiety is at a level where you can't get out with friends, take baby steps. Spend time with people you feel comfortable around like a close family member. What I personally did and still try to do every day, is one small thing that puts me out of my comfort zone. For example, when I first starting making an effort to do this, I would try make small talk with the person checking out my groceries. Or the bank teller taking care of a transaction for me. I then graduated to talking to a few women on online dating sites and meeting them for coffee. Trust me, the more you do this, the easier and more comfortable it becomes. \n\n7.\tMake Stress/Anxiety your friend - When I say that I've completely turned my life around, I don't mean that I don't have anxiety anymore. I still do, its just nowhere near as bad because I know how to control it now. However, the odd time it does get out of control, I simply welcome that feeling. Instead of letting it overwhelm me and spiral into an all out panic attack, I welcome that feeling and I tell myself that it's excitement. I tell myself that it's my body preparing me, giving me extra energy and confidence to accomplish whatever task is at hand. I learned this technique from watching a TED talk by Kelly McGonigal titled \"how to make stress your friend\". Honestly, this video has helped me more than all the CBT &amp; self-help books that I've purchased over the years.   https://www.ted.com/talks/kelly_mcgonigal_how_to_make_stress_your_friend Please do yourself a favour and watch this video now!\n\nLiving with a crippling anxiety disorder is not fun. I understand how fucking miserable, desperate and alone it makes you feel. I can sympathize with all of you because I lived my life with crippling fear for over 25 years! If you're feeling like there's no way out and that things will never get better, you need to tell yourself that they will and they will only get better if you spend the time actively trying to help yourself. What I wrote above is what worked for me. I'm not saying it will work for you, but if it does you will appreciate your life so much more because of the hell you had to go through to finally be happy and to finally love yourself and to be able to live your life without fear. You will appreciate life so much more than anyone who has never had to go through life with an anxiety disorder.\n\n",

            "selftext": "For years now, as long as I can remember, I have always had a lot of anxiety and aversion to people hearing me listening to the music I enjoy.  When my girlfriend comes home, or when someone enters my car, I always turn my music off. \n\nI have had some break troughs - I do play a more generic playlist for the guys at my martial arts gym as we train - but even if someone makes a joke about a song I feel a mix of emotions internally.\n\nI have made it a habit, or more of a compulsive obsession now, to analyze myself and get to the root of my troubles; 'the work to do on myself to be liberated from my problems'.  This revelation has unlocked a huge doorway to my personal healing and anxiety as a whole.\n\nI knew it was related to fear of self judgement, as it's a common trend amongst other expressive problems I have, but I never understood it with such clarity.\n\nSo here's what I wrote down in my notebook. Hope this might help someone else.\n\n---------------------------------\n\nWhy do you do &lt;it&gt; -- even when the music isn't even 'bad' or 'experimental'?  Sure, you have a history of people making fun of your music tastes, from your mother dancing sarcastically to it as a child to your friends belittling you as a teen, but why?\n\nFear of being judged.  I get that, the same reason why you get extremely anxious when its your turn to publicly speak or you want to speak out until the anxiety builds so you don't say anything at all...\n\nIn your upbringing when you were in a similar experience of being judged, it caused you a mixed bag of feelings:  Emotional pain, shame, embarrassment, anxiety -- all of which you took personal for one reason or another, due to low self esteem.\n\nYou didn't want to feel this these feelings, so as a defense mechanism you begun closing yourself down to not have to feel it again.\n\nAs a result, you 'hide' your music from people to not have to feel the pain again, like a child learning not to touch a hot stove a second time.\n\nWhat else are you hiding as a result?\n\n\n\n",

There are lots of horror stories or posts about negative outcomes so I wanted to take the time to share my story and maybe give people some hope.\n\nTherapy (I have an amazing therapist) and meds (Zoloft, 25 mg starting dose and now 50mg) have brought me from point A to point B:\n\nPoint A: Crying for sometimes 6+ hours, couldn't eat, cried in the bathroom at work, stopped working altogether, relationship with fiance severely strained, losing weight, sleeping for 2 - 4 hours per night, constant fog and depersonalization, intense depression and hopelessness, feelings of dread/phobia regarding work, constantly triggered by almost everything\n\n\nPoint B: Able to attend social events, returned to work and ended the year on a great note (I am a teacher), went to the bar with colleagues, excited to plan my wedding and day trips with fiance/friends, eating full meals and no anxiety about food, sleeping 8+ hours nightly, hope for the future, desire to help others and excitement for my upcoming school year, very few triggers and able to calm down when I am triggered. Have not had a true panic attack in weeks. \n\nThis all changed in a matter of weeks due to therapy and meds. I am on Zoloft and I have had NO side effects. It took about 10 days for the positive effects to begin and they have only continued. \n\nThere is hope! I still have days where I feel down or nervous, but in general I feel so much more hope for the future and the present.  And those bad days never spiral into depression, depersonalization, panic, despair, etc. I feel like I am almost back to being myself again.\n\nBest of luck to everyone in this sub. Seek therapy, possibly meds, don't let yourself needlessly suffer. I suffered for 5+ years before seeking help and I wish I could take it all back and do it again.\n\n",

I am 26 years old male and I am fearful of driving.\n\nThe main fear, which nobody I've ever talked to seems to understand, is I am terrified of fucking up, especially driving on a main road. By fucking up I mean everything from not left-turning perfectly (whatever that is) to changing lanes to hitting someone. I don't foresee problems driving in small residential roads or on a big highway with relatively few cars but my main fear/anxiety is on busy city roads.\n\nI would like some advice that doesn't involve medication where I can get over this anxiety of mine. I know I can get a shitty beater car and crash the hell out of it but the main thing is that I am actually less concerned about monetary losses than the embarrassment that comes from doing something like that in public. I guess it's a remnant of when I was a teen and I thought everyone was judging me constantly anywhere I went.\n\nUPDATE SEPT 17 2014: I got a perfect mark on my road test today. It's finally all over. This was my first try.",

When I do find an opportunity to speak it is usually ignored or I am given a blank stare.

It is not like they are saying anything extra-ordinary, or speaking more loudly. They just seem to have a gift for grabbing the attention of a group through some sort of expressive and enthusiastic tone.\n\nalso on the internet. (like on reddit) people tend to ignore my comments etc. and if they do pay attention, they are happy to point out the flaws in what I am saying and why it is stupid.\n\nI am now just wondering if I actually am crazy. Maybe I have lost my ability to use the English language effectively and lost touch with people to the point where none of my interests/opinions align with theirs.\n\nI am sorry if it sounds like I am having a big pity party... It just hard to be an outcast sometimes. It hurts, no matter how much you tell yourself its just your overactive ego being hurt, not you.\n\nAnyone else have this issue?\n\n\n",

The severity increases and decreases, from anxiety attacks everyday to only once a month sometimes, but there's always a persistent feeling of unease. Right now it's really bad. I've had multiple anxiety attacks the last 2 days. \nI feel like usually my anxiety stems from health issues, hypochondria maybe. But the last few nights I've just been anxious about \"what if I'm going crazy?\" Which has been pretty awful.\n\nI've done research on anxiety, and I understand how it applies directly to my symptoms. I thought that understanding would help, but it doesn't seem like it does.\n\nI would love to hear how other anxious redditors deal with their anxiety or how they've beaten it. \n\nYour help will be greatly appreciated.",

            "selftext": "Soon to be 20 and a sufferer of crippling anxiety. It has plagued me since childhood - the situation has greatly complicated since this Summer.\n\nI'm writing this from my phone at the park, so please bear with me.\n\nI was pulled from college in another city  to return home and essentially start anew this year. Two semesters of college, wiped away with a medical withdrawal. The agreement was this: return to family for better emotional support and save money on school.\n\nPreviously, I had been seeing a therapist and psychiatrist as I apparently have a mixture of depression, anxiety, and also exhibit bipolar characteristics. I was heavily medicated. Conclusively, though, I had been holding myself well enough to eat, go to school, and participate in extracurriculars. Eventually my therapist corresponded with my parents and pleaded that my health was not getting any better, and I needed to be sent home ASAP. My stomach sunk when I heard the news. So I left a part of my story behind and was dragged home.\n\nMy mom and step dad have never even remotely shown compassion or empathy toward my condition. It has always been a string of accusations including laziness, selfishness, and spite toward the family. My motivation to go about my day has dwindled to none. No more therapist, medication has ceased. Yesterday, my step dad flipped a switch and tried to physically fight me. He tossed me around the room like a ragdoll and wrecked my closet. I refused to hit him. Verbal abuse from him has been frequent, but yesterday I was told to leave and never come back. He said I'm a failure and a stupid child. I don't believe him, but I believe for the better of my health, I must get out of here.\n\nIdeally, I'd like to pack my stuff and leave to an independent living situation. However, I have no job and not permitted to get a car. I'm a finger press away from consulting a crisis or county assistance service to gain guidance.\n\ntl;dr My parents have no faith in me and want me to leave, what are my options?",

I try to hide how anxious/fearful life in general makes me. I've always felt so isolated because of my anxiety. It was until finding this subreddit that I realized that I am not alone. There are other people that fear talking to people, going to work, and other things that may seem silly to people without anxiety. \n\nWhen I read other people's post about hard times they're going through I feel compassion and empathy that I sometimes didn't used to give myself. I used to blame myself for my anxiety, and feel like a failure but I having trying to give myself a break.\n\nSo thanks again, the comments and support that some people have given me here mean more then they will ever know. Even if I just rant to myself here, or read other people's rants it reminds me that I am not alone.

I've been seeing a therapist for the past 3 years and she has been doing a great job of helping me through. \n\nFirst, I was able to sit patiently at the optometrist office and not panic over having to wait. Which is a major thing for me because waiting places has seemed to trigger my anxiety.\nThen, I was able to go to the store, by myself, and buy the things that I need but was too scared. I usually make my husband go with me for support, however he didn't want to go shopping so without thinking I just went. \nFinally, I went to the beach. Anything with large crowds pretty much sends me into panic. But I followed my therapists advice and just focused on myself and my husband. \n\nNow all of this is a good step for me, but I still have an extremely far way to go in order to be myself again pre-panic attacks. \n\nEvery little victory reminds me that I am just as normal as everyone else. \n",

I can't even ask someone at a grocery store for help, even though I know they're there to help me. \n\nI just need a new outlook on how I can deal with this - from those of you who may have gone through the same issues.
