But, the truth is I still do all those things. Despite sometimes wanting to just stay in bed all day and not face the world, I still do. I leave the house despite the fact I sometimes feel on the brink of a panic attack. \n\nIf that isn't courage, I don't know what is. I feel fear, and yet I overcome it. As does everyone else with an anxiety disorder. Although this didn't cure my anxiety outright, it certainly gave me a little confidence boost. I hope it helps you guys out too. ",

Even now certain details of my life from that time, for instance the TV show that was on in the breakroom during my breaks, can be a trigger for me.\n\nAnyway, this morning I dreamed that instead of a call center I had worked for an Olive Garden, and that they wanted me to come back.

I started having panic attacks in October '13, which gradually turned into periods of time where I'd be anxious for days on end and break down completely. My anxiety was a still bit all over the place though. Some days I couldn't leave the house and other days would be totally fine. \n\nI started on 20mg of citalopram four weeks ago for anxiety and depression. I felt it helped me a fair bit in the first three weeks, but the fourth week has been really bad for anxiety. How long should I give the citalopram before I think about upping the dose or trying to new medication? \n\nAnyway, I've been having the most trouble lately with derealization and existential panic. Derealization has been common during the last few months, though the existential thoughts that accompany it now are awful. What is all this? Why am I here? Am I real? Is the world real? What is the meaning of life? etc. etc. I can't get a break from them and it's making my life extremely difficult! It feels like I don't know who I am anymore. I know the thoughts are irrational and unresolvable, but that doesn't make them go away. Is this just a symptom of my anxiety? The derealization seems to be at its worst after periods of high anxiety. I don't have any history of OCD behaviour, but the thoughts themselves feel very obsessive. \n\nI guess it'd just be nice to hear from people who've had similar thought patterns and come out the other side. It's such an isolating experience to go through these feelings. Any advice would be great. ",

            "selftext": "So, here is the background story. At the end of my 2013 Spring semester of college, the 3rd to last day before the semester ended, I was driving to school and I had to go to the bathroom. I had to go REALLY bad, so I drove into the school's library parking lot, parked as fast as I could, then walked as fast as I could to the library bathroom. Feeling like I was going to crap my pants, I walked towards the men's bathroom towards the back of the library. I walked in to find the only 2 stalls were currently occupied. Starting to panic even more, I quickly jogged upstairs where I knew another bathroom was located. I walk up to the door to be presented with a locked door and a sign that said \"bathroom closed for maintenance.\" Panicking, trying as hard as I could to not have an \"accident\" I made an executive decision and just ran into the girls bathroom into a stall, (luckily no one was in there). After relieving my bowels I thought \"okay, that was a close one,\" and then I figured I would be okay.\n\nThis is where the issue originated. From then on out, I seemed to have a huge problem with being able to control my bowels. I figured it must be anxiety related because it is entirely in my head. Every single time I get in my truck, or even walk to my truck, I instantly feel the urge to go to the bathroom. Obviously this is an issue since I have to commute to school, with no where to stop on the way because my classes start so early in the morning, sometimes I just have to turn around and something I don't even make it to school. Also, when I want to go back to my hometown, which is roughly 3 hours away, it's just as bad. One time while driving back to school from home, I had to stop 9 different times to use gas station bathrooms.\n\nEvery time I go somewhere now I have to wonder how far it is and plan where I could possibly stop to use the restroom on the way. Note, this problem is severe; I have to go to the bathroom RIGHT when I feel the urge coming on. I have tried multiple things to help, including probiotics, talking to psychologists to help change my mindset, etc. but nothing has worked.\n\nI was wondering if anyone else on this subreddit possibly experiences the same issues and what has worked for you. I've visited multiple GI doctors and none of them have said I have colon/stomach related issues, they just say it's IBS (irritable bowel syndrome) and give me anti-diarrhea pills (which do not work).\n\nTL;DR: I think I have possibly more than IBS and need help, all resulting from potential anxiety.

More specifically, I felt like my mind was less well connected to my body. My typing suffered, I became clumsier, and I often struggled with tip-of-the-tongue syndrome. So, I talked to my psychiatrist and decided to taper off of Klonopin. \n\nI had been taking 1.5mg a day, so I reduced the dose by 0.25mg (half a pill) per week. Anxiety returned for sure, but it was no worse than the prior 26.5 years of my life, so I was managing OK. And then the time came to stop altogether. I'd been on 0.25mg daily and had been feeling OK. \n\nI took my last dose on a Sunday morning. By the following Wednesday, I was in severe withdrawal. Headaches, vertigo, hand tremors, SEVERE anxiety, and sweating were all present and accounted for. By Friday I decided I couldn't cope, so I called my psychiatrist again...but apparently he only works Mondays and Wednesdays! Since I was jonesing like a fiend and could barely function, I had to make the call alone to start taking the klonopin again.\n\nSo, now I'm back on 1.5mg daily. And I still hate it. It's become a source of anxiety in and of itself, rather than a solution. I'm back to having racing super fast thoughts and being unable to focus well. I did talk to my psychiatrist the following Monday; we're going to start the taper again and then he has another drug that will help me get all the way off the benzos at the end. \n\nSo, if your psychiatrist recommends benzodiazepines...tread carefully. I never thought I would feel like an addict, but I do now. I barely drink and don't do any drugs, but I feel like I have failed, like I need to be in a 12 step program or something because I am hooked on these stupid yellow pills in order to get through the day.\n\nRant over.

I don't know if he was always the horrible person I saw at the end, or if he had changed so much, but it made me so anxious I couldn't go any further. I tried telling him but I knew his response would be aggressive, and that scared the shit out of me. \n\nNow I'm angry at myself. I check out how he's doing every now and then, and it hurts. He's found new friends, and I'm all alone. I don't even have social anxiety, but I just can't seem to find new friends.\n\nIt hurts me, and I'm afraid of the future.

            "selftext": "Let's work together to actually seem some results. I made an app recently for the sake of improving mental health. It reminds you with vibrate+sound notifications to both meditate and exercise if you haven't already. You have to fulfill the daily requirements by using the timer built in or else it'll keep reminding you.\n\n[Screenshots of the app so you get an idea](http://imgur.com/a/Sqhoq) \n\n[App in playstore](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=azureloop.azurebreath) \n\nWe'll use the default time (20 minutes meditation, 20 minutes exercise). But let's change it from the default single reminder to 4 daily reminders. The time of the reminders don't matter particularly, just set it to whatever is convenient for you. \n\nFor those who don't know about meditation, it's basically a sitting exercise where you try to clear your mind through various methods. Normally it's very hard for us to sit in one place and do nothing so you'll meet a lot of mental resistance. But it improves after time and you'll finally realize that it is possible to sit there doing nothing. The most common and easy meditation is concentrating on your breath. When you lose concentration (will happen) you simply and calmly return to your breath. Doesn't matter how long you lost concentration, the important thing is that you returned to it. Deep breaths are key.\n\nThere are multiple types you there. [Here are a list of them](http://www.fitsugar.com/5-Types-Meditation-18949375). \n\nThe other popular type is known as \"mindfulness\" meditation. Where simply think about what you're thinking about. Accept going off tangent simply and keep observing your thoughts. Whatever happens just accept it and continue observing.\n\nHere are some papers on meditation\n\n[Mindfulness-based stress reduction for older adults with worry symptoms and co-occurring cognitive dysfunction](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24677282)\n\n[Meditation Programs for Psychological Stress and Well-Being](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmedhealth/PMH0063263/)\n\nAny many more exist. I assume I won't have to link the advantages of exercise... But what I do use for exercise is this: http://www.fitocracy.com/knowledge/dr-layne-nortons-best-damn-cardio-humanly-possible-in-15-minutes/\n\n\u201cis more effective for fat burning than walking on an incline treadmill for over an hour.\u201d In fifteen minutes. It doesn't feel like walking up for an hour but it does guarantee that I start sweating even in this winter.\n\nBy the end of the two week drill we will share our progress reports (graphs, built in) to  all on this subreddit and comment on how much we improved. If all goes well, we can increment our time to 30 minutes a day and possibly see some decent progress.\n\n[Link to app in playstore](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=azureloop.azurebreath)\n\nI am currently in the process of creating an iOS version but for now there's just android.",

            "selftext": "**I'm sorry this got so long.**\n\nI don't know what to do now, it's 1AM, I have class in 8 hours, I've already called my girlfriend and she has tried to console me; it didn't make me feel any better but I told her that it did so that she would not have to go to sleep feeling scared or sad for me.  \n\nI have anxiety.  A lot of anxiety.  So much that it ruins days at a rate that is beginning to feel almost total.  I don't know where to start so I'm going to start as far back as my obscurant memory will allow.  Not because I think it is necessary or that anyone will want to hear it, but because I've never spilled everything out at once before and I feel like it might be cathartic.  Cathartic both in that it is an intense spilling of emotion and as in it probably wont actually make me feel any better.  But I guess it isn't like I'll be sleeping soon anyway.\n\nI remember a time when I felt like everything was okay.  I remember being 5 years old playing in the backyard with my brother.  I remember the other kids in kindergarten making fun of me because they thought I had a crush on a girl in class; I remember how moments like that felt bad, embarrassing, sad, but not in any way that is recognizable to me now.  Things felt different then, maybe it was because I had breaks between the anxiety back then, maybe I wasn't anxious at all.  I only have a few of these memories left.\n\nMost of my memories don't exists as snapshots in time or a slideshow of my life, they exist as fact.  What I mean by this is that I know something happened, I can tell you it happened, I may feel like it happened, but I can't really remember it any more than if I had read it in a book.  Most of my memories are like this, cold, cataloged, distant.  I don't know why this is.  This is one of many things I've wanted to ask a doctor for the past few years, but as many of you probably know, it is not easy to ask things when you are sitting in an exam room or shifting uncomfortably on a shrink's couch.\n\nI feel like I was half-raised by shrinks.  From counseling my anxiety after moving from house to house for a few years, to being in high school listening to my parents fight in the basement of our house every night.  It probably wasn't actually every night but it felt like it.  My parents didn't know that I could hear them.  I learned this last year and every time I've seen my mother since she apologizes for it.  That only makes me feel worse.\n\nBut my anxiety was always manageable then, it existed almost as pervasively as it does now, but occasionally I could forget about it for a while.  Anyway, I made it out of high school, thanks to some teachers who gave me grades I didn't deserve, and went off to university.  Political Science and Pre-Law it was.  My first year was great; life away from my family was great, after the first 2 months where I didn't know anyone my life really felt like it was good, I felt like I could do what I needed to do to stay out of my parents' house forever.  I've stuck to that but it hasn't been as easy as I dreamt it would be.\n\nAs that summer came around I tried desperately for the last few months of school to find any sort of job and was entirely unfruitful.  I had no extra loan or scholarship money that year and my parents didn't have the money to put me up in a place in the city, I didn't have the money to put me up in a place in the city.  That summer I spent on friends' couches and empty spaces, places where no one else was.  It was during this period of half-homelessness that I was robbed the first two times; it was also the time that I learned I can survive a lot of shit.  I was living in a house with no electric, no gas, cold water (thankfully), a roof that leaked, and a pissed off cat that belonged to my roommate.\n\nThat summer I lost a lot of weight; I lived off of cheap alcohol and cigarettes, scavenged food and whatever money my parents could send me every month.  I told them I was living on a friend's couch all summer, I never told them that sometimes I had nowhere safe to sleep.\n\nOne night I was walking around after having a bit to drink and as I approach a corner three young guys turn and head my direction, I didn't think much of it initially but as we moved closer together I realized what was about to happen.  I figured it was too late to run.  As I walked past the first kid he sucker punched me in the side of the face and I went down hard; once I got my wits about me I realized they were running my pockets and one of them was yelling at me to give them my backpack.\n\nAs I became more lucid I realized these kids were probably 16 years old at the most.  It didn't much matter how old they were because I didn't dodge his sucker punch.  The kids didn't look like they were in it for the fun of it, they seemed like they just wanted my wallet.  So they took literally everything I had and started to walk away.  I, dazed, asked for my backpack back because I \"really needed it.\"  And, believe it or not, they gave it back.  So they took all my money but I still had my mp3 player and my cigarettes.  Some good citizens saw this happen out of their window and kindly called the cops who harassed me that night and continued to harass me into the near future.\n\nThis situation had me well rattled but I was on my feet pretty quickly.  I had a dry place to sleep for the next week or so, I continued looking for steady work and doing whatever manual labor I could find, but I avoided being out after dark.  I still do, usually.\n\nAbout a week later I began going about my normal business at night, only ever with groups of three or more, but still I wasn't afraid.  I went out once to go from the house I was staying at to a friend's place in a different neighborhood, once to go see a basement show, then once on a walk with friends as an attempt to begin to systematically desensitize myself.\n\nThis is when I got robbed the second time, and it was not quite as fun.  At the time I was right queer, beard stubble, painted finger and toe nails, some bright clothing, was really into Judith Butler, et cetera.  I've sort of had that beat out of me I guess.  I still enjoy theorizing on the deconstruction of gender but I wear the uniform of the correct gender.\n\nAnyway, this time me and two friends were walking down a, usually busy, street at night, it was in a family neighborhood with low crime and we were just going for a night time stroll.  As we are walking down this street three cars pull up in front of us a ways, we were all talking so we didn't think anything of it, again until it was too late.  A fairly large number of people jumped out of the cars (including a, likely stolen, car with a charity logo painted on the side) and lined up the sidewalk in front of us.  I began to panic, my friends and I began to shuffle around anxiously, clearly, not that it would have much mattered what we did since there were people all around us.  I walked first in the marching order, fuck if I know why.  Once I got to the end of the row of gentlemen a brawny guy, the biggest of them, grabbed me around the neck from behind and pulled me to the ground.  At this point I went numb and heard myself calmly utter \"Aw fuck.\"\n\nI didn't get hit right away, at first there were three guys standing around me, they didn't look like the poor kids who robbed me last week, they were smiling and laughing.  One of them goes through my pockets and grabs all I have left, a zippo lighter and a paint pen and a few cigarettes.  (I had left half a pack at the house I was crashing at because I didn't want to carry all of it on me)\n\nThey take the nothing I have on me and start calling me a bitch and one of them slaps me across the face.  This whole time I am sitting still, hoping they will just go away like last week.  One of them started kicking me in the ribs, I got kicked in face, and then I started moving.  I got from the sidewalk almost to the street when one of them kicked me down to the curb, I thought for sure I was about to reenact a scene from American History X.\n\nI got up and got away to the other side of the boulevard.  I turned around and one guy was following me, I got ready to do I don't know what and he got called back by an older guy sitting in a fancy car.  My friends were fine and the rest of the summer was easier.\n\nTo this day I am afraid to go out at night.  I am afraid to go out during the day.  I feel a near constant pain in my chest.  I'm trying everything I can and nothing helps for long.  I'm in my last semester.  I have debt, I have no job, I have a fractured spine (doctors are split on if it was caused by being kicked in the spine or by heavy lifting), I planned to take a year off before law school; I'm hoping to find a job in a law office since I can't' do construction any more, I also can't stand or sit for long enough to do almost any other job (combination of mostly pain and some anxiety).  I don't know where I am going to live in two months.  It feels weird paying a phi beta kappa fee to a stuffy guy in a suit while feeling crushing despair that I will have to relive my past because I might not be able to pay rent.  I don't sleep much.  I'm trying medicine and therapy.  I don't know what to do now.\n\nTonight I had the worst panic attack of my life.  I felt like I was shaking violently back and forth like an overclocked metronome but I could see that I wasn't actually moving.  I really thought I was going to die, it lasted for only a short while but I didn't stop crying until about half-way through writing this.\n\nOn second thought, this really wasn't the most frightening experience of my life.  I guess writing this did help.  Whodda thunk.  I feel a little better.  I'm going to sleep.  Thanks folks.",
