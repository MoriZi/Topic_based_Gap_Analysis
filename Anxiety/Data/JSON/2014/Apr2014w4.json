Really?!? How does that accommodate those who have telephone and social anxiety? Not to mention conjuring up the energy and courage to maintain that phone tag crap.\n\nEven the definition of someone in crisis is a problem. Does a person really have to have gotten so far into their issues that they're contemplating suicide before we consider that person in crisis?!? What about someone who has disassociated and completely checked out?\n\nFinally, there's an assumption that people seeking help in the US healthcare system can advocate for themselves but those suffering from anxiety and depression struggle with daily tasks, let alone intensely stressful tasks such as having to call multiple times just to reach a person making appointments.\n\nAnd this rant doesn't even touch on financial side of this issue.",

I avoided looking at them for a full 24 hours because I was dreading the \"justifiable angry/hateful\" responses. And of course all replies ended up being casual, friendly comments adding to what I said and of 47 people who voted on my comment, only one downvoted. I try to use examples like this to calm myself down but it never seems to work.....\n\nI told my roommate about it and he said, \"That's just an irrational fear from your anxiety. Just be open minded and don't assume anything.\" to which I sarcastically replied with \"Oh yeah, ya know I never have thought of that. Youre so right! *poof*, You cured me of my anxiety!\" So I figured you guys would be able to relate more than him.....\n",

            "selftext": "My sister Sam has suffered from severe depression and anxiety throughout the past ten years, but took medication and went to therapy to deal with it. About five years ago, there was a slow but darker shift; she stopped leaving the house, never hung out with friends and stopped attending any social events. She couldn't keep jobs, because she was getting too much anxiety; she stopped answering the phone or e-mails. Finally, she moved back into my parents' house to save some money and because my parents were worried about her well-being.\n\nOver the past two years, she has stopped leaving her room at all if it will result in any interaction with my parents or guests. She doesn't work and doesn't leave the house; she doesn't spend money either, my parents basically just provide a small amount of food and insurance for her. She waits until they're gone to eat and shower. They live across the street from my husband, baby and me (just to illustrate how close my family is - we have weekly 'family dinners'), but I have literally not seen or talked to my sister in a year. She's never met my baby girl. The few times I have dropped by their house unannounced, I could see her running to her room and shutting the door; when my parents occasionally speak to her, she looks away, can't look into their eyes and answers very quietly. I have never seen this severe a reaction to social interaction (with family members, not even strangers) and I am really scared that I may never see my sister again. \n\nWhat is happening to Sam? This seems to have gone beyond anxiety to something much scarier. What would cause someone to never leave their room and be so terrified of speaking or calling or looking at anyone? Please help me.\n\nTl;dr\nMy sister is a shadow of the wonderful, affectionate girl she once was. I haven't seen her in a year, even though she lives next-door. She won't look anyone in the eye. What is happening to her?    \n\nEdit: grammar",

He was very aggressive. He would beat people into the hospital for the slightest thing, but since meeting me he has kept everything in check. He hasn't been in a fight in years. He rarely gets upset, let alone angry because he knows how frightened I get. \n\nThe other day he saw that I was texting with his friend and completely lost his temper. He was punching the wall and smashing bottles and acted in a way that I never thought he could. He terrified me. I spent the night in the spare room with my 90lb pittbull standing guard at the door. \n\nEver since that moment I can't bear sitting next to him when we're home alone. I'm terrified to sleep with him, and usually wait until he falls asleep before moving to the guest room. I've spoken to his friend that I am close with, and he has confirmed that my boyfriend has never even come close to hurting a woman. Other than getting angry while drunk, he has never hurt me before. He has grabbed me or pushed me while drunk but has never made me feel unsafe. \nAm I wrong to be so afraid of him for that one event?\n\nI don't know what to do. I have no one to talk to.

The anxiety is crushing. And it takes so much energy to fight it back, to fight off my irrational self. Do you know what it's like to not be able to trust your own feelings, your own perceptions? Every day is a war between my thoughts and my feelings, but you never see it. Maybe sometimes it spills out. In my outbursts, in my breakdowns. You get a glimpse, but you have no idea the things going on up here in my head. Part of me wishes I had the capability to explain it to you. Part of me doesn't want you to know cause you'd think I'm crazy. But I do want you to know how hard it is. How exhausting it is. How much of a handicap it is.\n\n\nI go through so many peaks of emotion in a day. The other day I was having a bad morning. I was sitting in front of the mirror doing my make-up. I would start to cry. Then I'd stop, tell myself everything was ok, I'd be okay, took a deep breath and I was fine. 30 seconds later I was sobbing again. Days like this I'm sensitive to the smallest tings, like an emotional time bomb. My anxiety spirals and my mind just becomes a mess of toxicity and irrationality. Not all days are like this because I fight off the toxic thoughts and emotions.\n\n\nSo I want you to know, how hard it is, for me to go to class, to study, to go to work, to remember bills, or important days and dates, to fill out paperwork. It's harder for me because I've already given so much of my mind to the task of staying sane. To the task of keeping it together. It occupies so much of my time, so much of my self. All the while I'm trying to figure out myself, to be myself. So I hope this letter gives you even the smallest indication of what it's like to be me. And I hope it halts the judgement and the second guessing and the disappointment. Because I am trying my very hardest. And all things considered I think I'm doing a damn good job. And I'm proud of myself. And I want you to be proud of me too. I'm healing. And I intend to get back to a place where every day isn't a battle, where it all comes a bit easier, and I'm free to focus on myself and my life, not the toxic thoughts.\n\n\nUntil then, maybe you can understand.\n\n\n\n**EDIT:** As the title says, I didn't intend to show anyone this, besides you reddit. But now I'm wondering if I should show this to who I wrote it for, particularly one of my good friends. I need her to hear these words...but I'm also scared of whether or not it will be taken seriously and what her response will be. What should I do? ",

I wrote a blog post about the experience so if you're interested you can check it out at the bottom.\n  \nI suffer from sever panic attacks. I went to the hospital. I then was sent to a mental health clinic. The point is it helped me more than anything else I've ever tried or done in my life, so if any others on here suffer from incredibly debilitating symptoms I highly recommend going to one. I got more help there in the first day than I have in the last 6 months.  \n  \n  \ntl;dr If you have an extreme, and I mean extreme, anxiety problem I highly recommend taking a stay at a mental ward, they will change your life.\n\nhttp://panicattacklife.blogspot.com/",

I applied for many jobs where I didn't have to stand around in one spot for too long or be the center of attention. I can easily do a job stocking or pushing carts but being a cashier would kill me. I am also afraid that if an employer calls me and wants to schedule an interview that I will have a panic attack during the interview. Also, what if they fire me because I am limited by my social anxiety? I am just really afraid of what will happen. It's not that I don't want a job it's just I am unsure whether or not I can hold the job or do it. Thanks for listening to my little rant.",
