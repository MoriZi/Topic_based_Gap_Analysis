            "selftext": "The one thing I see in this forum over and over again is people blaming their personality. They believe that they are inherently weak and in general abnormal because of feelings of intense anxiety.\n\n**The problem was never the simple fact that you feel anxious or even afraid. Nor was the problem the way that you express yourself when you feel anxious or stressed.** Anyone can experience anxiety and there are lots of ways to express that sense of worry. What sets apart the people here from others who aren't battling anxious disorders is the *intensity* of the anxiety that you feel. This is a very important key in your recovery and management. \n\nBelieve it or not, most of the things that you do *are normal.* Stress habits, worries, even the fear of success are all things that anyone can experience because it is a basic feature of the human brain to weigh risks and adopt ways to cope, even if those methods used to cope aren't logical (good luck charms, horoscopes, etc).\n\nYou have to give yourself the credit you deserve. Blaming your entire personality will only add to the stress that will eventually add up to feelings if intense anxiety. That's no good. **Your personality is not the problem.**\n\nThe different anxious disorders have lots of things in common: indecisiveness, self consciousness, fear of failure, inadequacy, disappointing others, rejection, being exposed in your social environment, being exploited, being overwhelmed from thinking ahead, developing stress habits, urges to alienate others, even urges to lean on others for support. All of which can be chronically distressing and even disheartening to the person who feels compelled to do these things.\n\nAll of those things are related. **All of these things are normal human things.** We're social animals. We're supposed to lean on each other when we need them. No one can do everything alone. We listen to what others think about us so that we can learn if we are valuable to those people, and to help us learn about ourselves. We all have to take big risks in life and we all have to be prepared for the worst things, even when we feel like we've done everything right - that's just being realistic. Most importantly, we all have a breaking point and we will all hit that breaking point sooner or later. \n\nNone of those things were ever the problem. Just because you experience these things, that does not make you weak or defective in any way. These are all normal things that anyone can experience given the right circumstances. **There's no reason to feel ashamed or embarrassed because you are experiencing things that any person would experience. You do not have to hold these things against yourself.**\n\nThe only real problem is the intensity of the anxiety that you feel. This may make you hit your breaking point sooner or keep you up a little longer at night but that's really it. That's the difference between a generally anxious person and someone who isn't. **It's not what you do, but why you do it.**\n\nRealizing that the difference between you and the rest is such a small difference will allow you to see yourself through much better scope. One that allows you to see that true extent of your problems is much smaller than you currently realize.\n\nWhen I struggled with anxiety, once I realized how much I had in common with the average person, I realized that my attention was in the wrong places and it was making me worse. I was carrying around the unhelpful notion that I was meant to suffer because I was the entire problem. It was when I realized that I had misjudged myself as inferior for no real reason that I really started to make improvements. When the burden if believing that I was a person of weak character was lifted, I started to see myself as a person of merit. That's what made my recovery possible and permanent.\n\nTo anyone reading this who is looking for a way out of an intense pattern of anxiety, the best advice I can give you as someone who once had to live with that curse... Please humanize yourself and give yourself the credit that you need to make the changes that you want. You are much more normal than you realize and it's safe to accept it.\n\n\n\n",

            "selftext": "So I've suffered from anxiety and depression since middle school.  When I was younger it was easier to moderate with therapy and occasional exercising/diet change. Unfortunately I find myself in my late 20s and things have gotten out of control (at least a full panic attack per week, anxious non-stop) so my therapist suggested talking to a psychiatrist and perhaps taking some meds.  \n\nNow I was a psych major in college and have a *basic* understanding of how different meds work and the side effects, etc. so I'm also aware of the benefits of a combo of therapy and medication.  I was prescribed Lexapro by the psychiatrist and since this was my first time filling the prescription, I had to have a consult with the pharmacist.\n\nThe pharmacist immediately looks at the medicine and asks, \"what's wrong with you?\".  Slightly taken aback, I tell him it's for anxiety and depression.  He then starts lecturing me on mental illness and  declares that I don't need the meds because what's wrong with me is all in my head and I can \"get over it\" if I really want to.\n\n**I WANTED TO SCREAM**.  Bitch, are you my psychiatrist?!?  Or a psychiatrist in general?  Then just stick to your job, tell me about the meds, and keep your opinions to yourself.\n\nBut of course I didn't say anything like that cause the last thing I needed was to draw tons of attention.  Just told him that my Dr prescribed it so I guess they thought I needed and let him lecture me on alcohol use.\n\nThank god I didn't fill my Klonopin script.  I can just imagine the speech I'd get from that one.",

            "selftext": "Past:\n\nWhen I was 17, I developed some serious social anxiety problems. I also became extremely agoraphobic. I stressed and panicked every time I had to take the subway to get to college every morning. Sometimes I had to get off and throw up because I always felt sick to my stomach. I felt trapped when the train doors closed shut since I felt like I was stuck in the train until we reached the next station. If the doors closed and the train didn\u2019t move for half a minute, I\u2019d start getting panic attacks and only when the train started moving again would I feel relieved.\n\nAt college, it wasn\u2019t any better. I was insanely uncomfortable in classrooms since I wasn\u2019t used to large class sizes. I had to skip a lot of classes. I was never hungry, and I probably lost about 25 pounds in 3 months (6\u20191 165 -&gt;140). I also lost many of my friends because I couldn\u2019t explain to them what was going on. In short, my life sucked hard during that time.\n\nBut here\u2019s why I\u2019m writing this. As much as my life sucked, I didn\u2019t give up. I grinded though each day even though I knew it would be painful sometimes. Eventually my anxiety seemed to relax a little bit, not because I made rational sense of my fears but because I got tired of going through this stuff every damn day. I just brute forced my way out of my anxiety. Every time I\u2019d put myself in a situation which gave me anxiety, I\u2019d kill a little part of that anxiety hovering over me. It\u2019s difficult to put yourself in a situation you think you can\u2019t handle, but it worked and eventually, fewer things scared me.\n\nPresent:\n\nNow I am 22. Sometimes I am still anxious but I\u2019d say I can handle anxiety very well to the point where I feel relatively \u201cnormal\u201d. I think getting passed this part of my life is by far my best achievement in life.\n\nLast week, I got stuck in the subway in the middle of the tunnel. This was my ultimate fear back then. I was literally trapped in a locked crowded space and I couldn\u2019t get out. No electricity to the train, no ventilation, only a few lights lit. Needless to say, my heart rate rose sharply at first, but that was it! I was stuck in there for a good 45 minutes and I handled it like it was nothing. I couldn\u2019t believe it! I was probably the only person in there who was actually happy because I proved that I had changed a lot since my problems started. We had to climb out of the train and walk to the next station and that was that.  \n\nSo there you go. You may think that your problems never go away but if you work at it and put some effort to get better, you\u2019ll get out of it. Hope this helps someone.\n",

She said that my symptoms sound more like depression but there's also some strong anxiety symptoms, so she put me on Prozac. \n\nOne of my symptoms before I even got on prozac was that my anxiety was already crushing my libido as it was.\n\nA month later, I told her that some of my anxiety had faded, others persisted, and that my libido was going downhill even further. She increased my dosage to 20mg.\n\nSince then, I can't masturbate, I can't get aroused, and when I even try, I can't orgasm. Trying to orgasm gives me an anxiety attack because it's never been that big of an issue.\n\nMy husband understands and has been incredibly supportive. He isn't pestering me about the lack of sex at all besides a very calm question of \"How's your libido been lately?\" We've tried having sex just for him, but he can't enjoy sex unless I'm enjoying it.\n\nSo I've gone for 2+ months with basically no sex, and it's killing me.

            "selftext": "It all started 2 months ago. I had a terrifying and intense panic attack that lasted several hours after smoking marijuana. It was so severe that I began to chug Gin in order to black myself out, so I could end the panic attack/go to bed. That plan backfired, and I ended up pacing outside, extremely paranoid, on the brink of calling 911. Somehow, through it all, I was able to tell myself that I was having an adverse reaction from the weed, and that the feeling would go away come morning. I couldn't have been more wrong.\n\nI woke up the next morning in a funk, and extremely anxious. I even left work early that day because the anxiety was so intense. I quickly made an appointment with a psychiatrist and counselor, and was put on a low dose of meds. After a couple of weeks, I started feeling even more anxious, so I decided to stop taking them (I've always been skeptical of medication, so that didn't help).\n\nFast forward to today, and I'm still pretty shook up (although not as bad as I was at first). My biggest fear is that I'm slowly losing my mind/developing a mental illness (specifically Schizophrenia), and that fear is absolutely consuming me. I quickly learned that I shouldn't google symptoms of the illness (or anything in that realm) but the damage has been done, and now I can't stop thinking about them. I'm especially freaked out right now because I thought I heard someone call my name at the grocery store, but I couldn't confirm if it was just a voice in my head, or if I was mishearing something someone was saying. I read a personal account of someone with schizophrenia, and he/she said that his/her first symptoms were thinking that someone was calling his/her name from another room.\nThe only thing that gives me hope is that I have 0 family history of schizophrenia, but anxiety runs down the family line in every generation.\n\nSo, are my worries coming true? Does does there seem to be a serious mental illness developing? I would appreciate any advice/thoughts/etc. Thank you for your help, and thank you for listening.",

They said it's not a big deal and so i have my appointment. \n\nWell I first get there and find out I have the wrong insurance. So I'm looking like an idiot asking what's the difference between dental and medical insurance and why dental isn't part of medical since dental is a part of medicine. I honestly didn't know they were two separate things. The nurse starts trying not to laugh at me, which makes me feel even worse, so then I'm fumbling around my phone trying to find the info and i finally find it. \n\nI go back and just remind them that I would like to at least be numbed for the cleaning and she said that was fine. They go and take pictures and i find out that my gums are receding in the front of my teeth and that I need to have some procedure done or I'll lose them. They hand me a bill before we start for $600. I literally have less than $100 in my bank account.\n\nSo  I naturally start crying and freaking out. I say I thought it was just $40 today (for xrays and a cleaning) and that I don't even have half this and he said it was ok, they would just do the regular cleaning and I could schedule another appt when I had the money. So they start the cleaning and I ask if I was going to get numbing cream or something and they said they didn't have time because they were running behind on their next appt (since it took me 30 minutes to find my dental info). Which makes ME feel like a dumbshit. So now I'm freaking out that 1. My teeth are falling out 2. I have all these needles in my mouth 3. These people know I'm dirt poor and 4. I'm causing people to run behind schedule. \n\nI can feel myself starting to have an anxiety attach and try to tell them I need a break. They say something like \"we just started, just wait a few minutes and it will pass\" and so I wait. It gets worse. and worse. and worse.\n\nI'm straight up sobbing at this point and just sit up with all their shit still in my mouth and just say I can't do this and I'll pay for the cleaning anway. They got about halfway through, so I just give them my card and leave. \n\nI took some of my klonopin, but I just want to crawl into bed and die. I was supposed to do laundry and go run errands I just mentally can't do anything right now. I hate this feeling. ",

After the long-winded list was complete, the counselor said that I could very well have an anxiety disorder - but there's a chance that what I may be is depressed or bipolar. \n\n\nWith that news I instantly started crying. I hadn't even considered the possibility of being bipolar, and having that suddenly on the table was terrifying. I've been crying several times a day, sometimes intensely for extended periods of time, since then. Today I had to pull over onto the shoulder of the highway because I couldn't stop sobbing. That news felt tragic. I remember being perfectly mentally healthy, and I lost it. I feel careless, and useless, and like I can do nothing right. It feels like the greatest loss of my life, and I cannot seem to be able to cope with it. I used to be so incredibly happy. These days I'm only ever sad, nervous, and/or scared. I feel like I have been shattered. I feel so alone, and I feel like that is what I deserve. I can't stop thinking about, almost grieving over, what feels like the complete loss of my sanity. \n\n\nAny advice on how to deal with that feeling of loss, or comforting words of any sort would be greatly appreciated. \n\n*edited to add more description",

I also get neck and chest pain, heart palpitations, very hot and clammy and feel totally detached from reality. I suffer from anxiety constantly and don't take anything for it, but I get these episodes even when I'm feeling quite calm.

People who are practically strangers are posting pictures of me and my daughter on facebook and it makes me so so anxious. I feel like, at the very least, they should've asked my permission.

            "selftext": "My boyfriend attempted suicide while on Citalopram for only a few days. It screwed him up that badly. While he was in the hospital, he just sat still and emotionless even while people were talking to him, but was able to be led around.\n\nAs the drug in his system wore off, he started speaking but seemed to have altered thinking. His mother, a doctor, told me he showed signs of a depressive psychosis episode after she went to see him while I was asleep.\n\nI'm worried that he is going to be like this forever. It's been 17 hours now and he still believes that everyone hates him and wants him dead, and his anxiety is through the roof. It really hurts me to see him in so much pain.\n\nI'm wondering if this medication is supposed to work by giving depressed and anxious people delusions that everything is going to be okay when it is not. In his case, it worked in the opposite way.",
