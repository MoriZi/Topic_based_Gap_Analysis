I knocked something over which basically nullified all of my work for the week.  I sat in lab for an hour not dealing with it, just staring blankly and avoiding acknowledging it.   I gave up trying to get anything done at 1 in the morning.  Cleaned up and just sat in lab alone, not even feeling like moving.  Absolutely fucking worthless. My stomach ached the entire time.  I went back to my room, cried, tried to play video games to calm down, got more frustrated.  Cried again and went to sleep.  Woke up at 1(aka I slept 12 hours), didnt even bother showering until 4.  Went to dhall at 4:30 cause i knew noone would be there, i just needed to eat alone.  Ate a tiny meal and barely even finished that. Just sat procrastinating.  I have 2 papers and a resume due monday, but i've just shut down.  I have no results cause i ruined everything friday, everyone will know, idk how the hell to explain that. I dont see my therapist till tuesday but i really just want to talk to someone and i feel like i cant tell any of my friends",

            "selftext": "So recently I was at a convention and noticed an item that I grew a bit fond of. I passed it over the first time as I do with most purchases I make, but later on decided it was one of the things that I would go back and buy later.\n\n\nIt's a pretty simple thing but it's almost like a security blanket in the sense that it seems to have been helping me calm down. Whenever my anxiety starts to get bad and I physically handle it it has a comforting effect, though I can't recall such an attachment to anything before. \n\n\nIt's a stuffed little Mono Bear from the game \"Dangan Ronpa\" that [is about the size of my hand](http://i.imgur.com/HVvdqUD.jpg). I like to keep it attached to my wrist with the little red band or tuck it into my hoodie [kind of like this](http://i.imgur.com/ggM0BuE.jpg). \n\n\nSo I was wondering if anyone else has experienced this or knows anything about it in general. I don't know if I should try to break the habit, since I get a bit anxious when I don't have it close, or if it is something that passes with time. ",

            "selftext": "At the moment I am feeling some terrible anxiety, which I experience almost everyday. I feel like I'm dying.\n\nThis time last year I thought I was going to just get better, as it turns out I'm worse off than I ever was. Friday I could barely get through my classes, I had an anxiety attack through my entire first class, could not focus or care about anything during my second class (because I was in anxiety attack recovery mode) and by the time my third class was over I had basically been experiencing anxiety nonstop for 5 hours and went home and crashed. All weekend I have been hiding but tomorrow I have to go to classes again. It's such a normal thing for most people, but it fills me with dread.\n\nI feel confused so often. I get an anxiety attack when I do something stupid like forget someone's name or forget that I already made coffee because I'm sure it's a symptom of a brain tumor, or otherwise a symptom that I'm dying. Little things that happen everyday like dropping your keys or getting dizzy after standing up, have me convinced I am dying, and I live everyday like it's my last (not in the philosophical way) and I can't live like this anymore. I'm constantly saying goodbye to my mom and my friends in my head. It's so frustrating and painful. \n\nI can't concentrate on any written words on a page. I try to do the work that interests me, and I try to engage in my studies that I have looked forward to my whole life, but the words just look so flat and meaningless. If I don't get control over this I'm going to flunk out.\n\nI want so badly to live life and see the world as I did when I was a child. I thought I would turn out so differently. Now it's like there's this big wall between me and life. I can appreciate all the awesomeness in the world, I can logically perceive myself in it and how fortunate I am, I have all the means to be happy, but it's like this: you're craving a delicious slice of chocolate cake, you want it more than anything, and there's a piece that is literally right in front of you, but everytime you take a bite, you don't taste anything, and you don't understand why. I want to taste things and feel things again.\n\nI made a second appointment with a therapist, the first appointment I didn't divulge most of the most consuming aspects of my everyday struggles. I was too anxious to be open with him. But now I feel like I need to be completely honest with him so he can fix me. I used to tell myself I would never go on meds, but now I would take anything if it would just make this anxiety disorder go away.\n\nI don't know if this is the right place for this, but keeping all my anxiety inside all the time, day after day, is making me go insane. If anxiety was a voice in your head, then mine is getting unbearably loud, it's screaming at me and I feel hopeless 24/7.\n\nHelp me. I am losing control of my life. I wish I could say those words out loud to someone.",
