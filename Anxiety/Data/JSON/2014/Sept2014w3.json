I'm trying again this year, but I woke up late today and as I was getting ready, I thought about how my prof and other people in the class would look at me for coming in late. Last week, the prof berated a guy for coming in late, and I don't think I could handle that. Now I'm just sitting at home with my anxiety being worked up by thinking about what I'm missing in class. I really don't want to fall behind again and screw myself over, but I'm not sure what I can do in this situation. I feel like I'm going to have a panic attack, and I'm really afraid of that.

It got to where almost anything on there would trigger something, which would snowball into something bigger than it actually was. \n\nI deal with enough stress and anxiety from my job and I don't need any more.\n\nIn the past I was always on Facebook, but over time, it has gotten to where I'm hardly ever on it. But when I do, something always tends to give me an anxiety attack. \n\nSo here's to hoping that I won't have as much anxiety because I won't be tempted to check the app. \n\nEdit: I appreciate everyone being so supportive of me. To be honest, I was nervous about this post after I made it.

            "selftext": "I had an assignment due two days ago in my math class. I didn't turn it in because I procrastinated on it to the point where I was too sleepy to do anything and fell asleep. The next morning, I decided that I was just going to turn it in the day after (which is today). Now today, I didn't do it again and I'm getting afraid of \n\nA) My potentially shitty grade and\n\nB) My math teacher reprimanding me.\n\nI know B is a stupid thing to worry about, but I really am scared of how this bad impression will affect future experiences with my teacher. And I mean, the whole reason why I neglect to do the homework is because every time I try, I get a sudden urge of laziness and start making excuses out of it. If i pull it out and try to focus, I get a headache and cannot find a single way to motivate myself. There's always some pit that forms in my stomach that annoys the hell out of me. Not to mention that I have no clue how to do any of it.\n\nNow I feel like I'm trapped between working through the stupidly obnoxious lethargy for the obvious reward and owning up to my wrongdoings and just not doing it and feeling bad about it for the whole day. \n\nI know what the right answer is to this question, but it's annoying me that my previously good-standing work ethic from way back when has diminished and now leaves me feeling like this all the time. I wish there was an easier way to do homework but I cannot focus on work for the life of me and it's scaring the hell out of me.\n\nI don't think I have any attention-deficit related issues because this only happens at home instead of school, but I cannot for the life of me get myself to do my homework. I'm stuck and I'm freaking out.",

            "selftext": "First off I apologize for the long story. This is something I've been fixating on for nearly 24 hours straight, since it was initially brought up.\n\nSecondly - there are mentions of sexual abuse. If that is a trigger for you, I apologize, and here is your chance to click 'x'.\n\nI'm having a hard time lately figuring out where my anxiety is coming from. I've always had anxiety and having panic attacks since I was 18, but it's only been in the past two-three months it's gotten to the point where I can't leave my house, I don't feel comfortable in my skin, having panic attacks 1-2 times a day. I've been going to therapy and it's helping a lot. I've seen a psych and she's diagnosed me with type two bipolar, and I'm taking minimal amounts of Seroquel (had a bad reaction and waiting on medication advice from her).\n\nOkay I guess I'll start at the beginning. My memory here is fuzzy and here's where things get weird - because I don't know if this constitutes as sexual abuse, but it's the only memory I have.\n\nWe had neighbors my parents were friends with. I was about three at the time. They had a son, R, who was six. R used to lock me in his room and touch me and force me to touch him. I hated it, I really only have one clear memory of it happening (top bunk of his bed, he blocked the view with a giant teddy bear that was like, human-sized) but I have a feeling it may have happened more.\n\nWhen we moved far away from them I was so happy. I remember when I was about six and had some questions about sex. I nervously asked my mom how somebody got pregnant and when she told me I broke down crying and freaking out. It took a few hours for me to admit to her that I thought I was pregnant, because of what R and I had did years ago. It was very hard to tell her what had happened. I felt dirty and ashamed.\n\nWhen I was 10 R and his family moved to the island. They stayed with us for a few weeks and I was uncomfortable having him around. I was staying in the top bunk in my brother's room at my dad's house (I was there the whole summer) and one night R (who was 13) was talking to my brother (who was 7). He knew I was awake and could hear them. He was telling my brother loudly how 'sexy' I was, and how he wanted to fuck me. I hated hearing it and asked him multiple times if he could just shut up. \n\nThat summer I stopped eating. I actually had to be hospitalized because I wouldn't eat. I bathed 3-5 times a day with the door locked. I had problems sitting down for dinner. I would eat a bite of food and immediately go run to the bathroom and sit on the toilet for 15-20 minutes, go back, eat another piece of food, and run back to the bathroom and run another bath for myself. I didn't play or anything that summer, I stayed in bed and cried that I wanted to go back to my mom's house. After my visit to the hospital I started eating again, and once I got back to my mom's everything was fine.\n\nAt this point I would like to clarify that I've always had issues with my dad - he was overbearing and angry when I was younger. But I know in my heart that he would never have done anything to hurt me, or anything like that. My parents have been at war since they split up and I always chose my mom's side, she was always more comforting to me.\n\nAfter that I ran into R a few more times, my town was small. He always creeped me the fuck out. One time when I was 14 my dad took me aside and asked me to give him a chance. I guess R had tracked down my dad's new address and gone to ask my dad for permission to court me, which my dad thought was honorable. I told my dad no way in fucking hell would I ever date that guy. I haven't seen him since I was 17 (so 7 years ago) and last I saw he had tried meth for the first time and hadn't slept in a few days. Last I've HEARD about him is that him and his father moved to Nova Scotia, so, good riddance.\n\nIn the last few months my anxiety has flared up much more than normal. I'm agoraphobic. I freak out anywhere in public. But there have been some things I've started becoming concerned about.\n\nI have a problem with my gag reflex. Most of the time I walk around choking myself and holding my throat. My stomach feels fine, but my throat just wants to retch. My mom's neighbor and best friend noticed it and asked my mom if I had ever been abused as a child. \n\nI still hate eating. I've always had a real problem with food. I eat once a day normally.\n\nMy boyfriend and I haven't had sex in over a month. We've been together a little over a year and I love the hell out of him. We've always had a very normal, healthy and loving sex life (if anything, a little too vanilla for me), but it's been over a month due to my anxiety that I just feel like I cannot. I also have been sleeping on the couch most nights. I think out of the last month I've spent 3 nights beside him in the bed.\n\nI've always had a problem with pelvic exams. I have horrible panic attacks when it comes to doctors performing pelvic exams on me and I avoid them at all costs. \n\nWhen I first had sex **I did not have a hymen**. This concerns me a lot. The first time I had sex I felt nothing - no pain, nothing good. There was no barrier, no pressure, no bleeding. I didn't ride horses, do gymnastics - there is not many other options for why I wouldn't have a hymen.\n\nTampons are sending me into a shock-spiral. Not TSS. I just started my period and I tried to insert a tampon. I had it in for about 3 hours and I had a horrible panic attack and dizziness ensued. I thought it was TSS but there is no way. As soon as I removed the tampon, I started feeling much better. I haven't used one since and it has not occurred again.\n\nBaths are also now a place of great discomfort for me. I used to love having relaxing baths and it's only been in the past few weeks/months that every time I get into a hot bathtub my mind spirals and I cannot concentrate on anything except fear and panic.\n\nI'm sorry this is so long. I'm off to talk with my therapist about all of this in an hour, but I just sort of had to get it off my chest.\n\nI'm not sure what happened with R. I only remember one thing. I'm not sure if that's even construed as sexual abuse, or if it's what is manifesting within me right now. Part of me feels guilt for even suggesting it because I know that thousands of people endure abuse much worse. I'm definitely minimalizing it in my mind and trying to convince myself it was something normal, childhood experimentation, but I remember crying and saying no, and how dirty and ashamed I felt when I had to tell my mom.\n\nI'm also wondering if anything else happened that I can't remember. I'm wondering why I didn't have a hymen. I'm kind of afraid of all of this. I'm looking forward to opening up with my therapist about it. It's the first time I've ever really explored my past in this way, especially with what happened with R, and it's almost putting the anxiety at bay - like there is something strong within me.\n\nSorry for the long post guys. I'd love opinions or thoughts. ",

            "selftext": "I have been seeing this psychiatrist for about six months now and I had never been a big fan of him. I was considering switching doctors a few months ago, but we finally found a medication that was showing a lot of promise, so I decided to try to stick it out and get to the right dose. \n\nOn our first meeting, he told me that he doesn't have an email, so I should just text him if I had any questions or concerns. Over a few weeks, he never answers texts, so at the next meeting he says to call him instead. I called a few weeks later, intending to leave a voicemail in case he wasn't available, but instead answers the phone to say he's busy with a patient, not even letting me ask my question. He says he has office hours around 6pm, which seemed to work fine for a few months. I never called him more than once or twice every two weeks, and the conversations were always very specific and lasted less than three minutes.\n\nToday I called him 10 minutes past 6 and he answers, interrupts me introducing myself, and stated very angrily that he was eating dinner and didn't give me his phone number to ask him questions, and that it was for emergencies only. For almost two minutes he kept chastising me, saying that I should consider finding another psychiatrist or schedule a meeting if I ever needed to talk to him. After over a minute of him just yelling on the phone I had to actually interrupt him, apologizing and saying I wasn't aware there was a problem and then I was completely fine scheduling an appointment. I apologized several times and thought he would understand, but he kept going. Said he wasn't working for free, and asked me several if I wanted to work for free for somebody. I apologized again and simply said, \"I honestly wasn't aware of what I was doing. I'm sorry, and I'm completely fine scheduling appointments from now on.\" He paused, said something along the lines of \"fine\" and then hung up on me. \n\nI understand that he wants me to come in more often for meetings, but did he have to start yelling and belittling me the first time he mentioned it? I was in shock when I got off the phone. \n\n**tl;dr:** Psychiatrist has no email, tells me to call or text for any questions. Has a different problem every time I try to contact him via this method. Ends up yelling at me over the phone for several minutes, ignoring my apologies. \n\nedit: After sleeping over it, I decided he is never going to see my business again. I already scheduled an appointment with another provider and requested a release of all my medication information.

Like a row of elevators only for certain floors?\n- Do I have to ring an intercom to get in this building?\n\nI normally do an EXTENSIVE search of the place I'm going to before heading out (google street view, reviews, etc).

            "selftext": "I'm so frustrated by this. I'm 29 and I've never been able to get my driver's license because I panic every time I'm behind the wheel. Until I was about 24 it wasn't such a problem because I lived in a city with great public transit, but since moving to my current location, it's very difficult to get around. I have overactive guilt and feel awful about asking people for rides, which means I rarely get to see my friends. And then I feel guilty because I want to be more involved in my community and do volunteering, but can't because I can't actually get around. Aaaah! Not to mention that I feel selfish if I vent about this issue to people close to me because they're already suffering by having to give me rides.\n\nI know that there's a huge cognitive issue here. When I was learning to drive as a teenager, on the way back from a parallel parking session I freaked out, hit the wrong pedal and drove through a fence. I had probably the worst panic attack I'd ever had at that point, and couldn't stop thinking that there could have been a child behind that fence (or a dog. I know it's ridiculous, but I love dogs and if I hit a dog I'd about die). Now every time I try to drive I can't stop thinking about how big and fast the car is and how easily it could seriously hurt or kill someone if I made a mistake. I hear my friends who drive say that they can't stand being driven in a car by someone they don't trust... but I don't trust myself. And then I feel like a bad person because I live a passive life. \n\nThe other relevant thing I guess is that my dad is an alcoholic and abuses prescription drugs, and he's a truly scary driver. I have a lot of anger and resentment about how many times he's endangered our family by driving us when he was under the influence. So I think that's part of why it's such a hot button for me too.\n\nMy umpteenth learner's permit expires in October. I don't think I can get my license by then, even though I've put in a ton of practice over the years and intellectually I know /how/ to drive. I just psych myself out every time. I doubt posting this is actually going to solve the problem for me, but it's something that I get upset thinking about almost every day so it kind of helps to vent about it. ",
