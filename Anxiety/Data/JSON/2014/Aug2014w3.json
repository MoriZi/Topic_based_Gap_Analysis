I posted on here a few days ago saying how hearing the news about Robin Williams increased my anxiety significantly and made me feel slightly more depressed about the world. \n\nI had an appointment on friday with my physc doc and happened to mention this to him. He told me he wouldn't normally say this but as he's leaving (It was his last day before retirement) he told me that i would not believe how many referrals his department had received from GP's who's patients have come in saying how depressed they are about the news of Robin Williams.\n\nHe said if one good thing has come out of all this, is that people are now coming forward with under lying mental health issues. \n\nJust thought I'd share that as i know it effected a few people on this sub.  \n\nAnd just to let people know, your not alone. \n\nEdit : Spelling",

I've another visit coming up Monday.\n\nBefore I started seeing this psychiatrist, I had been taking Wellbutrin 75mg for a month for depression (got a prescription from a walk-in clinic). I love Wellbutrin. It has certainly helped me. But I have noticed my anxiety has gotten sooo much worse since being on it.\n\nI tell my new psychiatrist that my anxiety is really having a negative effect on me, but I don't want to be taken off Wellbutrin. He starts writing down \"Ativan\" on his little notepad, then scratches it out and says, \"No, I don't think that's the way to go. We need to keep it natural.\" \n\nSo he ups my Wellbutrin to 150mg, but won't give me any anxiety medication. \n\nHe gives me 3 goals to complete in 3 weeks and insists that if I complete these goals, my anxiety will decrease. The goals were: get a job, join a gym and become healthier, and go to an AA meeting (alcoholism).\n\nI did all three of those things, yet my anxiety has not gotten any better. I actually tend to panic at my job sometimes, and I think my new boss has started to notice. \n\nI go to see my psychiatrist on Monday, and I'm terrified he still won't give me any medication for my anxiety. I think it's fucking stupid that he refused to prescribe me anything, knowing that Wellbutrin has anxiety-causing side effects, and knowing that I am prone to panic attacks. I do not have dependency issues on anything besides alcohol. I can see how taking the \"natural\" way can help depression but it has not helped my anxiety one bit. \n\nHow do I get him to see that I need some medicine? Has the \"natural\" way actually worked for anyone else for anxiety? Is it normal for doctors to not prescribe anxiety medicine until the second visit?\n\nMy doctor doesn't know this, but I've taken Klonopins a couple of times as a way to relieve my anxiety. That's how I know this shit does work for me. I don't want Xanax, I don't even know WTF Ativan is, but I like Klonopins and I know it helps me. But I don't want to tell my doctor, \"Hey, I know we just met, and I know you're the doctor, but I know what works for me.\" I think he DEFINITELY wouldn't prescribe me something then.\n\nSorry so long.",

            "selftext": "Well over a year ago, I quit my previous job due to a bunch of family-related issues, and anxiety about how I was treated there/in that area. Unfortunately, since then, I sunk into a spiral of depression, living the \"NEET\" life, and was unemployed until earlier this month, where my only option was to re-join the lovely world of retail, only a larger, more busy environment.\n\n...And it's hell. When I applied there and made the call, I felt proud of myself. I felt like some gust of bravery came over me and I was now able to accomplish everything. I really felt like I finally made my family proud, and I didn't have to feel guilty about my situation. Since I started, I've felt nothing but anxiety, dread, sadness, and exhaustion. Whenever I'm at home, I spent 90% of my time worrying about work. On a psychological level, I'm constantly in worry. I keep looking at the clock and viewing the time in relation to when I have to show up for work, when I have to wake up/take a shower, etc. It's effected me physically, too. I constantly have that \"butterflies in stomach\" feeling,  I eat less, I sleep (a lot) less, my tone of voice has changed, I stutter a lot when nervous, and embarrassingly enough, I find myself constantly having to use the bathroom. I don't even enjoy my hobbies, too. I rarely play video games, I don't find many things funny anymore, and I'm not nearly as interested in music as I used to be.\n\nMy mother seems to believe that I can just flip a switch and \"not worry\" despite me constantly telling her how anxious and depressed it makes me feel. My older brother, who is very mean/abrasive, is under the impression that I'm pretending to act this way, so whenever I get visibly/audibly upset, he keeps saying \"stop the *act*\". I have no other family, and my extremely-small group of friends can't relate in any way, and are unable to dispense any advice. At this point I am unable to receive any type of psychological help because my family is uninsured. Half of the problem is sheer depression, because I have no family, low self-esteem, and the future seems bleak as hell, and the other half is sheer anxiety and panic due to the stress of working a busy-as-hell retail gig, which I absolutely **suck** at.\n\nIt sounds pretty desperate, but I've been looking on Craigslist for jobs I could do at home, such as writing, proofreading, graphic design, etc. but there's so many scams out there. Also, I figured I'd rake in enough money to be able to pay my (cheap) phone bill and throw some money towards groceries, etc.",

I literally thought I was dying that very moment of a major heart attack. \n\nMy mom swerved out of the way but the truck did really mess up.

I'm dizzy everytime I'm not asleep and even than I wake up in the middle of the night feeling bad. My parents refuse to believe that it might be anything else, or help me when I am basically crying cause I'm sick of feeling this way. \n\nI graduated high school in 2013 with a high gpa and good grades and I didn't have terrible anxiety nor was dizziness a symptom than. (I've had anxiety since I was in elementary school).  And they convinced me to stay at home at a community college for a year or two cause of money. My parents make decent money, but because they never save we live paycheck to paycheck in a $300k+ house. So they refuse doctor visits and medication, even after my doctor and another neurologist ordered a MRI of my head..she said yeah sure! And than refused after. That was a year ago. \n\nI did poorly in one of my classes, I took notebooks of notes, there wasn't any tests only one paper and a group presentation. I did the entire presentation for my group cause they had kids and long hours at work, and my paper he said sucked because I didn't use the sources he wanted. Which was a book over 100 years old that costs over $200 just for a copy. He failed most of the class, and complaints to the dean didn't do a thing. Now they refuse to pay for school. \n\nThey told me to get a job, and I got one but they aren't happy that I picked that specific job cause they said, \"you'll get bored\" it's the local Y. I love it there with nice people, something to keep my anxiety on the down low. \n\nI've been working for my mom at her job for a couple weeks finishing filling their records but I couldn't go wed, cause I had to go up to the school to remove a hold on a meningitis vaccine that I already got a year ago, and they wouldn't answer email or phone. She was pissed. Today I was supposed to go with her to work but I said I'll go, but I really need to go up to the school cause my issue was resolved but all the classes I picked are already full and idk what to take now. \n\nShe screamed that her blood pressure was too high lately and it something happened to her it was because of me. On top of that they are basically making me break up with the gf I've had since October of last year because they like my older brothers gf more? My gf is a straight A 4.0+ gpa that is so caring and got a scholarship to one of the biggest private schools in the state. But they don't like her now. They are just trying to make me unhappy. \n\nI'm grounded now..and they took my car away and my devices later and I'm no allowed to leave the house or see anyone. I don't know what to do anymore, I'm so unhappy with my life.. And my anxiety has reached an all time high in my 20 years here. ",

You guy's have downloaded [Panic Pop](https://play.google.com/apps/publish/?dev_acc=13173502598993103496#AppListPlace) over 1000+ times in the first two days. That's pretty incredible. \n\nI would like to run a [little survey](https://www.surveymonkey.com/s/ZB8VZCD) to see how the game has helped people. If you have had a panic attack and used Panic Pop to treat it, please take it. It's two questions, won't take you more than a minute.\n\nI'd rather not clutter up /r/anxiety with further updates about Panic Pop, so I think I'm going to be like every other game developer on the planet and [use twitter](https://twitter.com/flaqueEau). If you would like updates, I encourage you to follow there. You also can keep an eye out on [my personal website](http://codeisscary.com/). \n\n**If you would like to help Panic Pop** grow and be able to help more people, [this could really use your support](https://www.thunderclap.it/projects/15209-stop-panic-attacks-with-games?locale=en).\n\nI would like to talk to you guy's about **another game** that I found out about a little while ago. [Flowy](https://flowygame.com/) is a mobile game that's coming out this fall. The game uses Breathing Retraining Exercises to help the user calm themselves during a panic attack. It's being backed by a lot of much more knowledgeable than myself. If you find that Panic Pop really just isn't your thing or maybe it's not working for you, I would seriously encourage you to check out Flowy. \n\nFinally, I would like to make an important announcement about Panic Pop. It's important to understand that Panic Pop is a temporary solution. The best method by far is prevention. If you are having panic attacks consistently, seek a therapist. Other solutions like /r/Meditation and regular exercise can help tremendously. Most importantly, options like exposure therapy and cognitive behavioral therapy can be your ticket to recovery.\n\nEDIT: Fixed the link.",

My eating schedule was completely screwed up, and I subsisted mostly on junk/tasty foods for over two years because I had such a fear of trying new things and cooking. I'm very surprised that I'm not fat.\n\nDrinking: Every day I had to have at least one 20oz soda. $1.50 a day for something so unhealthy really adds up as an unnecessary expense. I guzzled down so much it gave me horrible heartburn and nausea when I worked at a job with free fountain drinks.\n\nVideo games: It wasn't hard for me to get extremely hooked on any game I played, and I'd often stay up until 4-5 in the morning playing games, or at least as late as I possibly could given my schedule. When my anxiety was highest, I didn't even sleep and just played a lot of games when I should have been working on finals/etc.\n\nSex: Even when I wasn't horny, I'd feel pressured to have sex for no real reason other than that it was interesting and I was bored. I'd go on Craigslist and write out long posts, then chat with people for hours before actually meeting if someone wanted to do it blindly. I lost my virginity on this site to a guy I actually found very unattractive because he was the first who wanted to meet me without me sending a picture of myself. I met a total of 17 guys from that site for various sexual acts with no standards whatsoever, something that I'm very ashamed of, and I couldn't even stay aroused with all but one of them. I dodged a bullet by not getting pregnant or STDs (though I did insist on condoms).\n\nI'm very pleased that my meds have evened me out enough that I now tell myself in the moment that it is time to stop at the right time. I didn't even realize that I was anxious/depressed when I was doing these things. \n\nAnd with the sex thing, even a month ago I just saw it as a dirty thing that I hated myself for but something interesting to do nonetheless when I was bored. I see that habit now as something I can very easily leave in my past, and I actually have a voice in my head telling me it is better to be patient with those things and to meet a guy who cares about me.\n\nJust thought I'd share a relevant success story since many other people with anxiety have OCD tendencies.

I've been having a hard time with the changes in my life so my mood swings are going crazy. Because of that, my anxiety is off the charts. \n\n\nMy fianc\u00e9 and father don't understand. In their minds, I need to get over it. Just forget I have anxiety and go out and make friends. They think it's just me being lazy and a loner. As if I enjoy hiding out in my house every day. \n\n\nI hate being stuck at home. I want to go out and have fun. Some days are easier than others and I can do exactly that, but lately, with my SO working, I just can't. We only have one car so even when I feel like I can handle getting out and having fun, I'm stuck here anyway. I hate myself for not being able to just let it go and be outgoing. I hate that they don't understand. I hate that they get mad at me when I try to explain what it feels like. Most of all, I hate that they think I'm making up excuses so I can just be lazy.\n\n\nMy SO is incredibly outgoing, he LOVES making friends. I do too, it's just harder. I find I'm more outgoing when he's around, but he obviously can't be by me at all times. \n\n\n\nI need to get back into therapy and find the right meds. If I don't, I risk losing a lot of good in my life and I refuse to let this BS mental illness fuck me over more than it already has. I hate letting it control me! I'm so fucking done! \n\n\nThanks for reading. I just needed to get this off my chest. I can't handle anymore bottling up.",
