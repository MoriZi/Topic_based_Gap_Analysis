Maybe her phone is out of power or she has no credit. But I can't help but think she simply doesn't want to and doesn't think its worth her time to tell me.\n\nQuick backstory - met her last Saturday at a bar. We hit it off. I asked for her number before she left. She gave me it. Then we kissed and she went on her way.\n\nI find it very, very difficult to put myself out there and ask a girl out, and right now I feel like I'm being punched in the gut. \n\nI really liked her to, and its been so long since I asked anyone out. This has always been my biggest fear when it comes to asking people out, and it feels like shit.\n\nThis is going to bug me for weeks.\n\nEDIT: Title should say *today, though ask a girl out day sounds like an interesting idea.\n\nEDIT: GUYS! SHE TEXTED BACK AND SAID YES! ONLY 7 HOURS LATER BUT SHE STILL SAID YES! YEEEAAAHHH!!!\n\nThanks for all the comments, it really helped me through the waiting. I really figured she wasn't into me. Now I can be anxious about my date this  Friday instead!",

I have to take Xanax for my anxiety, and I am incapable of being able to handle problems without medication. \n\nI also have a quiz today that I have not studied for because I am too unintelligent to know my priorities. I can't take it. If I do, I will kill myself. It is only worth 15 points, and I have made A's on the previous 2 quizzes.\n\nI can't fucking do this anymore.

            "selftext": "Hi... I've had a history of avoiding texts/emails when they stress me out, but I've managed to do somewhat okay with that until last week.\n\nI do freelance work, and I received an email Friday asking for updates, which I didn't have at the time. I ignored it and just wanted to get progress done over the weekend to send to them so I didn't have to respond with \"I don't have any updates right now\". But over the weekend they had sent a couple more emails, and I just got too anxious/scared to check those, because I feel like they are emails chewing me out. \n\nIts Tuesday now and I still haven't even read them. I told myself yesterday I'd check them and reply and sort everything out, but I didn't know how to explain my lack of response. I KNOW I have to do it NOW, but I'm still scared the emails might be negative and criticizing of my actions, and I'm still scared of what to say.\n\nI just need any advice or words of encouragement. I already know what has to be done but a simple task like this feels so overwhelming. :(\n\n**Edit:** I was forced into a more awkward situation when they CALLED me, and because of my iOS8/Yosemite set up, the phone call went straight to my computer AS I was typing, making me answer it by accident.. I panicked and hung up.. This was yesterday.. at that point I was planning to call back right away because it looked even worse to have answered and hung up. This was in the early afternoon, and my fear/anxiety was preventing me from making that call until 10PM at night! Horrible, I know. At one point I was literally sitting down for hours, torn between calling and not calling.\n\nEventually I made the call, but no answer.. the funny thing is, I called that number today and realized it was the wrong number after all (I'm an idiot). So no less than 10 minutes ago, I said \"fuck it\" and made the call... I gave the most sincerest of apologies, and tried to explain that it was a \"personal health incident\", and to my surprise, he was very sympathetic. He first made sure I was okay to continue the work, and from there we spoke business. \n\nI must say I still feel a bit of embarrassment having to communicate with other members of their team, AND I still have that weird feeling of anxiety/fear when looking through the emails I avoided, but none of them were THAT bad.. \n\nI just wanted to say thank you to everyone who shared their thoughts/feelings. I never knew how to explain this to anyone, but it definitely feels good to know that I'm not alone. This was by far the worst incident of the whole avoiding emails thing, but I will definitely follow some of your tips to avoid this type of situation. :)\n\n**Edit 2:** FYI, when I said \"personal health incident\", I didn't try and fake a physical injury or anything. I was trying to explain it without saying \"anxiety\", and he understood what I was implying.",

Prior to taking the dose (I'm starting on 10mg, generic), I had looked up reviews and generally agonized over taking it 2 days before I worked up the courage to take it.\n\n* I'm proud of myself for actually taking my medicine.\n\nTonight around 6 I finally fell asleep until around 7 or so for a nap, and I woke up feeling nauseous and panicked. I kept my cool, took some Emetrol, laid down again. I got that scary, cold, tingly feeling of depersonalization that I get when I panic, but I kept my composure. I closed my eyes, breathed deeply, and just laid still. After about 10 or 15 minutes, I got up, drank some water, and felt so much better just after that.\n\n* I'm proud of how brave I was to face that anxiety head on and just ride the wave.\n\nFor those of you who might be in a situation of \"should I take these meds or should I not\", I hope this story helps you decide for yourself what the best course of action will be.\nFor me, I was most afraid of nausea and vomiting because I have mild emetophobia. But it happened and I lived through it, and remembered to tell myself that the anxiety was just what I was feeling.\n\nAnyone else want to share their success stories for their medicines? Let's be encouraging for the ones who are afraid to begin. I was so afraid I nearly started having panic attacks just thinking about the side effects. What finally convinced me was this logic: \"People are more likely to share negative reviews than positive ones. There might be side effects you won't like, but you've lived through worse and you never know how bad it'll really be until you try. Hope for the best but prepare for the worst.\"\nI did exactly that. And it wasn't nearly as bad or scary as I thought it'd be",

            "selftext": "I am really sorry, but this is going to be a super long post...\n\n\nWe have to start from the very beginning so you can completely grasp how much my life is a total clusterfuck. \n\nMy mother has had several boyfriends/husbands since I was little. \n\nMy little sister's father was emotionally abusive. I honestly don't have any childhood memories from be fore I was 9 and that terrifies me. \n\nMy younger twin sibling's father always had an eye for me. Now, because I had never really had a father growing up, I never thought these things were weird. When I look back on it now I get it, but then I had no idea. \n\nFirst off, I was always his \"favorite\" (his words). He would hang out with me one on one more than he ever did with his kids, my little sister, or my mom. \nWe would have the \"sex talk\" way too often. He would actually give me pointers and ask way too personal questions about my sex life. He also told me once that he prefers small boobs over big ones, and told me that he doesn't like my mom's boobs very much (she has a boob job). \n\nHe also told me once that he sees me more of a mother to the kids (my siblings) and a companion to him. My mother was always too depressed to take care of the kids. I really was more of a mother to them. I spent MAJORITY of my days watching (mostly the twins) them from when I was 15-18. \n\nAnyways, when I was eighteen my parents were going to get a divorce because my mom cheated on my step dad (most likely because she saw the way he looked at me instead of her and how he was more attracted to me). I had to stay with my step dad at his friend's house when he left. We ended up having to share a bed, and he would cuddle with me at night because he was \"lonely\" and \"sad\". \n\nMe being really naive, thought nothing of it until one night he asked me if I would do mutual masturbation with him. I told him no, and about a month or so later him and my mom got back together.\n (I assume) Mostly because I ended up moving out and living with my boyfriend and his family. \n\nI dropped out of high school my senior year because when Obama Care kicked in no one was allowed to work full time anymore. So, I could no longer afford to feed myself and had to get a second job. \n\nEventually, my boyfriend's parents randomly kicked me out at 11PM in the middle of the week. After two weeks of couch surfing, my options for a place to sleep dried up and I was going to be homeless. \n\nSo, I called my younger brother's dad and asked him if I could move out of state to live with him. Keep in mind that I believed until I was thirteen that this man was my real father. Before my mom took my sister and I out of state when I was 12 to marry the twin's father (before they were born) I would stay with my brother and his dad every other weekend. He was in my life for as long as I can remember. \n\n\nAlso keep in mind (just so you get why I am freaking out):\n\nWhen I moved away from my brother's dad I never heard from him. He wasn't there anymore. I only heard from him on Thanksgiving and Christmas. This was for 7 years. \n\n Also, when I was sixteen my boyfriend raped me.\n\nWhen I was eighteen I went to a party and woke up to a camera in my face and some guy's hand down my pants.\n\nWhen I was 19, my SOBER friend tried to take advantage of me when I was drunk. \n \n\nSo, now I live back in the state I was born with my brother and his dad (who is married btw). Well, I have my nipples pierced. One day when I had just woken up from bed I was in the living room with my dad stretching. Like, the kind you do when you've just woken up with your arms above your head and your chest pushed out. I have no idea why my dad was staring at my tits, but I only had a tank top on because I had just gotten up, and he asks me if I have my nipples pierced. I figured I couldn't really lie about it because he obviously noticed, so I tell him that I do. \n\n\nFast forward to just a few days ago... I woke up really early because I had to work in the morning. My dad didn't have to work, so him and I were outside smoking cigarettes together and just talking because I had a few hours to kill before I had to leave. \n\nHe starts really curiously asking about my piercings. Me, being a really open person, and because the idea of him being a father to me is kind of a really gray area, I went ahead and answered what he wanted to know. \nWe finished our cigarettes and went inside and he started asking me if I had anything else pierced. I tell him that I also have my belly button done too, and that I have my pierced twice and gauged, and a tongue ring (which the ears and tongue he already knew about). \n\nThen he starts asking me if girls really get tongue rings for \"what they say.\" I told him that it really depends on the person, and if it even does any good depends on the guy, but I didn't get mine done for that reason. He then asks me if I have my clit pierced, to which I say no. Then he asked me if he could see my nipple rings. I told him sure (keep in mind, I don't really see him as a father and we aren't technically related). I pulled down my shirt and show him, and he asks if he can touch them. I told him okay, and he just sorta pokes at them surprised when he asks if it hurts and I tell him it doesn't. \n\nIt honestly didn't feel like a sexual thing. He genuinely seemed like he was just curious. I wouldn't say he groped me, or was trying to molest me. \n\n\nBut now, here's the issue:\n\nWhen it happened, I didn't really care, but as soon as I got to work it was really bothering me. I started thinking how if I did have my clit pierced then he probably would have asked to see that too, and would probably have tried to touch me there. \n\nAnd, when he asked to see the piercings he made a comment how \"it isn't anything I haven't seen before\" because he raised me when I was a child. Thinking back on when he said that really weirds me out. \n\nSo, now I'm really nervous about him trying to do something to me. I feel like I can't trust him. I've been avoiding him like a motherfucker because I feel scared and vulnerable. I also feel like I really fucked up because I just said okay and went along with it. I'm not a child anymore.. I'm 20 years old. I should know better, and I really don't even get why I was okay with it because now I'm not. What if he asks to see them again? \n\nI really want to talk to my boyfriend about it, but I already know that he is going to get angry with me for just letting my dad touch me. Or, he will probably try to kill my dad. I just want to cry and have my boyfriend hold me. I'm really starting to get upset about it. \n\nI really fucked up. I can't exactly blame anything on him because I just let him do it, and I'm a freaking adult. I should know better, but I did it anyways because I thought I wouldn't care and that it wouldn't be a big deal, but now I see it way differently. \n\nAnd now, I have to come to terms that I will never have fucking parents. Both of the fathers in my life have pulled this crap, and my mother is just a shitty person and chose her husband who wanted to fuck her daughter over me, and practically forced me to move out and let me almost be homeless. Also, not to mention she is a narcissistic bitch who is always trying to one up me in the looks department, can't ever be around me without saying something insulting, basically made me raise her kids, and not to mention the fact she pulled me out of school on the day of a state test to go with her to get an abortion, or and she would bribe me with staying out late if she could use my laptop to skype with her secret lover. Also, made me lie to my step dad so she could cover that she was cheating on him. She even made me watch my siblings for a whole weekend when I was 17 so she could fly to Cali to see her lover.  \n\nSo, I basically will never have parents or a family. The rest of my family is either shit, or I have never been close to them. The only family I have is my nana, and she's getting old so I'm really worried that her clock is going to run out soon. She's all I have. \n\nPlus, I can't mention this to my boyfriend for the reasons I mentioned before. I really want to talk to him about it, but I am worried he might even see it as cheating, or call me fucked up and leave me. Or he might even accuse me of lying. \n\nI really don't know what to do and I am freaking out. The only thing I can think to do is start going to counseling again. I really need some advice  for my fucked up life.\n",

Oh you touched something and didn't wash your hands? Dude you're going to die 40 years from now. You went outside and a dog sniffed you? Damn son, you have rabies, you're going to die in 2 weeks (this happened today). You're in a car? Wow, dude, this is it - your last day. Might as well embrace it in tranquility.\n\nI have this outlook that I'm going to eventually die and be punished by the supposed laws of the universe because I do certain things. I'm not sure how to phrase this in words, but essentially every task I do has a way to dying - and I'm afraid I'm going to choose the way to death, whether it be immediate or 60 years from now.\n\nI talked to a school counselor about my health anxiety and how death fucking scares me, but so far the therapy isn't helping and I feel like I'm forcing myself to go there to only satisfy my counselor (she wants me to meet every Thursday but I don't want to go because I'd rather do other things... I feel this is to a certain extent selfish but I can only overcome myself. I appreciate what my counselor is doing but it just is not working).\n\nSeriously any tips on how to deal with this? Death?

I'm starting to have health problems. I'm scared. I've been very depressed before and on paxil/xanax a long time ago. I've always struggled with anxiety. I have been pretty good recently. But now everything is just too much. I try to deal with the anxiety but I feel like all my issues are real. I have too much to do and I have fucked up some things at work because I'm trying to do too much. I just think it's too much and it's all going to come crashing down. I constantly feel like my body is in fight or flight mode. I can't sleep so I'm up all night which makes everything worse. I worry all the time. It's just too much pressure. I know I should go back to a doctor to discuss but I just can't take the time right now. I'm basically working 7 days a week and trying to keep up with all the normal obligations. This is my first time posting in years of lurking. There's so much more to say. But I guess I just wanted to vent. I can't/don't talk to anyone. I don't really have friends. My wife is great but I just think she doesn't get how overwhelming things are to me. I can't function sometimes because of the anxiety of making a call to a client for example and that ends up causing problems with deadlines etc.  I've been suicidal a long time ago when things were worse (in a much different way). I'm not like that now, but I just want the pressure to stop. I don't know what to do. I'm trying to handle it. I don't think I can. If I got hit by a car, I really wouldn't mind. I'm trying, really really trying. Working through it. I don't know what to do.\nTL:DR\nI feel like a balloon about to pop. There's no way I'm going to get everything done that's expected of me.

            "selftext": "By \"this\" I mean life. I feel like I can't be successful. I just moved to a new city, and am struggling to find work. I need to have money saved up for rent. I work at a call center right now and it sucks, but I need the money. I'm taking a year off from college to try and save and then maybe transfer somewhere new. \n\nI am stressed because I want to be able to make decent money. I don't want to make shit wage, but I'm also too young to be picky. I'm bloody nervous calling back people and places I applied for, but every day I am constantly sending in online applications as a shout into the void. I fluctuate constantly between happiness, then anxiety attacks creep up. I have a wonderful boyfriend in long distance right now, but should only be like that for a year. I feel like I keep comparing myself to him. He works in a trade and has had experience in it so he makes really great money. I want to be able to make as much as him. \n\nI feel like a failure because I KNOW I can do this. I just am not pushing myself hard enough, and I'm worried that I'm too focused on a magical job to come along and make me happy. I feel stuck. I just feel stuck. Any comforting thoughts, words, or advice would surely be appreciated. I need a severe pick me up. \n\nI'm trying to breathe. :( I know everything is going to be fine. I just don't know what the hell I'm doing with my life. \n\n(I'm 19) ",

            "selftext": "Hi everyone! Just a heads up that this post involves sexual assault and rape content.\n\nI'm a college student who was raped by her boyfriend while still dating him, choked and had my life threatened by him, and then raped again when he broke into my apartment a few months after us breaking up. I went to my university and, after a long a tedious process, got him expelled from my school (it was his second offense after being previously suspended for sexual coercion). I've tried seeing a handful of therapists and finally found one I really like (yay!). Last night at our session, she told me I could talk about anything I wanted. That led me to discuss anxiety that was present in my current relationship that seemed really random. Turns out, it's my subconscious pulling in stress from what I went through but my conscious blocks out those feelings on a day to day basis. I realized that I don't want to allow my ex to cause me any more harm so my brain tries to just ignore everything he did to me. So, basically, I'm paranoid about being cheated on and being abandoned and feeling that much pain again and allowing it to affect my current relationship through general anxiety and worry about my boyfriend cheating on me (although I know he never would..). And part of my problem comes from feeling like I cheated on my current boyfriend when I was raped the second time even though he tries to convince me otherwise and that he doesn't blame me at all.\n\nSO I'm posting in hopes of getting ideas on how to address my feelings towards my ex in order to be happier in my current relationship. All ideas are appreciated!!",

            "selftext": "So my friend unloaded on my this week about a lot of things that have been bothering him and making him uncomfortable around me. The last month or so my anxiety has just made me so incredibly emotional and has caused me at times to lash out or cry or just generally do/say things that make people upset or uncomfortable. Now these people don't want to be around me. The more I try to fix it, the more I make things worse, obsessing and dwelling on things instead of trying to give people space or just let them go entirely. \n\nHow do you stop obsessing? Multiple times during the day I just spiral into bad thoughts, every bad thing people have said about me or bad things I've done and said. Everyday has become a constant struggle to just feel level and not fly off the handle, burst into tears and inappropriate times. I think part of it is that my job is very solitary and a lot of the time I'm just surfing the internet because I don't have much to do. Although I have hobbies and things I occupy myself with outside of work, for 8-10 hours a day I have nothing to get my mind off my anxiety. What can I do?",
