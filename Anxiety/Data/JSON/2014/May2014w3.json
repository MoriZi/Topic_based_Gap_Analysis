I was (mis)diagnosed with ADD at only 8 years old and pumped full of experiemental medications until my senior year in High School. I grew up under the influence of ritalin, dexadrine and every other form of legal speed you can imagine. As an adult, diagnosed with GAD nearly five years ago during a brief stint in rehab, I rejected it. After being through hell as a child, force fed drugs I didn't want and reprimanded by family and doctors for resisting, it was impossible for me to accept. And yet, this morning, after years of day drinking to curb my anxiety and an inability to mainstain a steady job, a seemingly ridiculous fear of everything and an active resistance to discussing my anxiety with anyone, I looked it up. I looked it up because one of the most healthy relationships I have ever been in has found me miserable and terrified all the time. And I burst into tears realizing how incredibly calming it is to know that I am not alone. Now I have to brace myself for reaching out to my doctor. Which, I'm sure some of you understand, feels like the most terrifying thing in the universe. Wish me luck.",

Unfortunately, every single time I encounter some story that someone has written about their own situation that then becomes added to my ever-growing list of fears.\n\nExamples:\n-People with no mental health training / qualifications commenting on whether or not a particular symptom will ever go away (\"Depersonalization cannot ever be cured\" - a TERRIBLE thing for an anxious person to read)\n-People who have gone through extensive trauma or have terrifying thoughts that can then be absorbed by anxious readers (\"I am scared that I will think about harming my loved ones... I am afraid I will never be able to eat and have to be hospitalized\")\n-Horror stories about medications (\"It made me go crazy and I have never felt the same), etc.\n\nHonestly I am not really complaining or asking for any changes, but I think this could be a helpful resource if posters were more aware that anxious people are VERY sensitive to the power of suggestion and triggers. One anecdote that you share could become someone else's panic trigger that lasts for months. \n\nFor instance, I recently asked for posts about success stories to cheer myself up and bring me peace of mind, and someone commented \"Some day my anxiety and depression will get me.\" I realize this could be loosely interpreted as a message of perseverance, but it put all kinds of terrifying ideas in my mind about my anxiety eventually \"getting the best of me\" that caused me panic and depression numerous times since then.\n\nAre there any tagging systems or even just general ettiquette adjustments that can be made to make this sub a place for safe support without fear of triggers and picking up new phobias/fears?\n\nI want to believe that my anxiety and depression can go away (I've only had them for one month!) and it's hard when I feel bombarded by stories of failure and struggle instead of success. \n\n",

The one at my apartment almost sways in the shaft, if you shift your wait too much it bumps into stuff. It's so fucking infuriating. \n\nThis one time, a random got on and decided it was a good idea to shake the elevator as much as possible. Asked him to stop but he wouldn't. I blacked out. I shoved him against the wall by the neck. Holy shit. I couldn't help it, my heart was racing and I was scared for my life.\n\nThat's the danger of this stuff. Irrational fears or thoughts leading to irrational actions. I was so embarrassed. \n\nKeep hanging on everyone.",

I don't understand why she is doing this now.\nBut really the reason that I'm so upset is that I had a crying fit and anxiety attack when I got back the paper. I hate that I get so oversensitive. It didn't even affect my grade. I started crying even before I knew about the class. I was literally falling apart for no reason. Why can't I just function like a person? Why can't I just be a normal person existing?",

            "selftext": "Ever since my depression and Anxiety started up, I've felt particularly distant from my girlfriend. All of my good memories with her seem tainted now, as if they weren't really as good as I remember them being. I can see little flaws I never cared about before. Its like someone went through all my memories and circled every little thing that I didn't bother noticing, then wrote notes about why it bothers me. And why, based on that, I *obviously* don't love my girlfriend anymore. (FYI, I have a deep fear of leaving my girlfriend, so most of my anxiety is based around me leaving her and not caring, being heartless, etc, even though I *do* love her. It's annoying, stupid, and complicated.)\n\nMy girlfriend seems like a stranger. I know her, and I register that what I feel for her isn't platonic, it goes above and beyond that. I can't really register love right now...affection, yes, love? I don't know why but I can't feel it anymore. I know she isn't just a friend. In my head, She's where love should be on the scale, but its like that part of the scale is just...missing. I feel incredibly distant from her, and I don't know how to make that connection, especially when I look at her and she seems like a stranger to me. \n\nIts rare, but occasionally other people seem like strangers, too. I can't make emotional connections with people anymore, with the exception of a very select few. Sometimes I still feel things, but very vaguely and distantly. Oddly enough, I can still laugh and feel kind of happy. Occasionally, I'll get very dizzy and things seem almost dreamlike.\n\nIs this derealization? If not...is any of this normal for anxiety? If anyone needs better explanations just ask, I'm very tired and a little loopy right now. Thank you!",
