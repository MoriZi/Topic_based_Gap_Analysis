Look like you are writing and busy in class\navoid being called on\nyou know the answer but what if you stutter or mumble\nWhat if they tell you \u201cspeak up I can\u2019t hear you\u201d\n\n3. Don\u2019t make a noise\nhold in that cough that sneeze that breathe\npeople will hear you \ndo not draw attention to yourself like that\n\n4. Spend time every night before you go to bed to think\nThink about all the embarrassing things you have ever done\nEveryone remembers, that\u2019s all they remember\n\n5. Never enter a room full of people\nThey all look\nWhy are you here?\nWhy are you alive?\n\n6. Your friends all secretly hate you\nyou know why they didn\u2019t reply to your text\nyou know how they all dread seeing you\nyou are only put up with because of pity\n\n7. Always be scared\nScared to sit next to a stranger\nScared to see someone you know\nScared to eat in front of people\nScared to talk on the phone\nScared to go to social events\nScared to order at a restaurant\nScared to talk\nScared to have a panic attack\nScared to be noticed\n\nAlways scared\nbut don\u2019t worry,\nyou don\u2019t like people anyway,\nat least that\u2019s what you say,\nyou\u2019re \u201cantisocial\u201d\nYou don\u2019t even care what they think, people are annoying,\nthat\u2019s what you tell them.\nYou play it off as a joke\nbut really you\u2019re always scared.\n\n-Anonymous\n\nEdit; Well the format went all wonky on me, but you get the point.",

            "selftext": "So my girlfriend of the past several years suffers from high anxiety and stress. Whenever she goes through life changing events (moving/new job/family crisis) she is VERY prone to panic attacks. Most times they are what I would consider extremely intense, wherein she believes she's going to die and/or says hurtful things to her family and friends. \n\nI know this is debilitating for her and I would like to learn how to help her cope before, during, and after an event. There have also been times where the lack of emotional control almost brought an end to our relationship, and I would like to prevent that ever being a possibility again. I have tried everything in my very limited arsenal (over-attentiveness, logic, short bouts of avoidance etc.) but nothing has ever had a positive effect. Or at least not one that I've seen. \n\nIf anyone has been in a similar situation, please tell me what I can do to make her episodes more comfortable for her and less tolling on those around her.\nThanks /r/anxiety!\n\n\n[Edit] I just wanted to give a sincere thank you to everyone who genuinely took time out of their day to help a couple you will probably never know. I was a bit nervous and hesitant to share something this personal on Reddit but you guys really understand the situation my girlfriend and I are in. You all gave me insight and personal advice that I would have trouble finding anywhere else. I'm going to tweak my attitude and try some of these things immediately. So many thanks",

Pick a random item anywhere near you. (I'm gonna use a painting in this example to make it more clear)\n2. Look at it and think about it for about 5 seconds.\n3. Now look at a wall, and don't allow yourself to think about the painting, tell yourself 'don't look at the painting'. just stare at the wall and do not think about the painting.\n- Most probably you can't stop thinking about the painting simply because you keep telling yourself to not think about the painting. Now try this:\n4. Look at the wall again and allow yourself to think about the painting, it's okay if you don't but it's okay too if you do.\n- most probably you thought less about the painting or even forget about it entirely, simply because you allow your brain to focus on it if it wants to, or not.\n\nThe painting is anxiety. \nThe more you tell your brain to not think about something, the more it focuses on that thing, why? Your brain is an asshole.\n\nSo whenever you get anxious or get depressed thoughts or anxious thoughts don't tell yourself to stop thinking about it, because at that moment your brain is being irrational. And you can't fight something irrational with a rational arguement. \n\nInstead just allow yourself to be anxious and just think those thoughts,  eventually, it'll end. It always ends.",

I have ADHD with comorbid GAD and have tried every SSRI and benzo's. They did nothing for my anxiety and benzo's aren't something I'd ever want to consider a long-term solution to anxiety. \n\nA few weeks ago I took 200mg of L-Theanine before work. Everything about my day became 20X easier to manage. Smiling became easier. Talking to people became easier. I am very prone to panic attacks, but I have most of my triggers nailed down. This has been the biggest thing for me - things that usually trigger panic have stopped triggering it. \n\nI feel like my personality is finally able to break through the wall of anxiety that holds it back. \n\nAnyway, after 10 years of fighting with this, I never thought something I could buy over the counter would ever be the solution for me, but it has somehow. Obviously it doesn't work for everyone, but if one other person tries it (after discussing it with their doctor of course) because I wrote this and it works, then it's totally worth it. ",

            "selftext": "I've suffered from anxiety on and off for the last 8 years. My anxiety and panic attacks became progressively worse starting in September of 2013.\n\nI decided to leave my stable, steady, boring job to pursue a dream job. I was anxious,  nervous, and excited, but figured this was normal. During my very short stay at this job, I felt like I was under a lot of pressure. I was making little to no money and pulling 12+ hour days. I ended up having a really bad panic attack one day and couldn't perform. I explained to my manager my situation and I was excused. I went home with tears streaming down my face. I felt battered and bruised. I kept this job for a few more days and came to the conclusion that I wasn't cut out for it, and I left.\n\nSo here I was a month later, with no job, no income, and no prospects. From October until the end of December my anxiety and panic attacks sky rocketed. Besides the fact that I didnt have a job, I was also dealing with a lot of other triggers. I had stowed away some medicine, but used it sparingly because I didn't want to run out.\n\nI found myself isolated and depressed, which only made things worse. Finally in late December I landed an interview with a pretty promising company. There were three phases to the interview and I nailed the first two. The final step was an in person interview. I recall having anxiety on my way there and during the interview,  but somehow,  someway, I nailed it.\n\nI got a job offer and was set to start on January 6. It felt like impending doom, time was closing in and I went into full blown panic for several days straight, but the positivity of everything kept me grounded. I focused on the good, I got through the interview, I landed the job, and it seemed to be the perfect environment for me.\n\nThe night before my first day I was a wreck. I felt incredibly sick with anxiety. I woke up at 5am, a few hours before my alarm was set to go off and I was in an extremely negative state, my thoughts started spiraling out of control. What if I couldn't do it, what if I panicked, what if I passed out. What if, what if, what if. I drafted an email to my appointed training manager and told him how I felt and that I couldn't make it.\n\nI felt like a failure writing this email and I didn't even send it yet. My girlfriend managed to calm me down and thanks to her I mustered up the courage to go. I took 2.5mg of xanax, which would knock anyone out, but it kept me stable. I made it through my first day and was the most proud I've been in a while. But it wasn't over yet.\n\nThroughout the week I continued to have anxiety, and was popping xanax left and right. During an individual meeting with my training manager I spilled my guts, told him about my anxiety and although he didn't really know what to say, the few words of encouragement he did give me helped a little. I made it through last week.\n\nThis past Monday was the start of my second phase of training and I felt the same exact feelings I felt on my first day. I emailed my training manager and explained to him what was going on and then without shame, I emailed my direct manager, a woman who I had never even met and spilled my guts to her as well. I didn't know what to expect, all I knew was that I was tired of hiding. \n\nShe replied to my email, stating that she understood and that we should sit down and have a meeting later in the week. As the time went by, I found myself less anxious and went from taking 1-2mg of xanax a day to none at all. \n\nI had my meeting with my direct manager on Wednesday and it literally could not have gone any better. She comforted me and told me about how she was recently diagnosed with anxiety and she knows how it feels. I almost wanted to cry, because all this time, I felt so alone, like no one understood what I was going through, and here was someone that was able to completely empathize with me and actually ask me advice about anxiety and coping mechanisms. She assured me that anything she could do to help alleviate some stress and worry she would take care of personally. \n\nThis was Wednesday and since then I have not had an ounce of anxiety,  its almost like it vanished when I verbalized my fears and admitted that I was a slave to my anxious feelings. I'm not saying I'm completely rid of my anxiety,  but hopefully within time it will become manageable again. \n\nI urge you, not to run away from your anxiety, but to embrace it! I constantly ran away from my feelings and all that happened was that my anxiety became worse. It wasnt until I finally admitted to myself and others; I suffer from anxiety. Say it \"I SUFFER FROM ANXIETY!\" \n\nIf you're reading this, and you feel scared, if you feel alone, I ask you to get those feelings out in whatever way you can.  Cry, scream, breathe, punch a couple of walls, or reach out to someone for support, someone who you can trust. \n\n I wanted to share this story with you because I know how detrimental anxiety can be to a person's well being. No one deserves to feel scared and alone. If I can overcome it, you can too. \n\nStay strong and breathe. \n\nTL:DR; I promise you will be ok. \n\n",
