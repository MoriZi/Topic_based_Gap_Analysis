I guess you could say I'm the hipster version of mental disorders...anyways, I've learned a lot in the last decade and a half and I wanted to share it with you here, because I love this subreddit!\n\n1. Therapy is important, don't give up on it.\nI've seen four therapists in my lifetime. I've moved three times. Each time I moved, I thought \"New life, new environment, new mind.\" As many of you know, this is not always the case with anxiety. Battling it takes work and help. Stick with your therapist. Find someone who works for *you*, someone who is committed to your wellbeing. \n\n3. Know the difference between your brain and \"anxiety brain\"\nNormal you brain is a good, well-rounded person with all of the potential and opportunities in the world. Anxiety brain wants to stop this. Only recently did my therapist tell me to treat my anxiety/OCD as the \"other\"; an ugly creature that was not a part of my being, but just an unwanted passenger I had to kick out of the car. That ugly passenger isn't just going to jump out willingly, it will hang on to the edge of the car door while you're speeding at 90mph. But the weaker and quieter it gets, it's a lot easier to turn the radio up and drown the sonofabitch out.\n\n\n3. Anxiety will never completely disappear and that's okay. Contrary to popular belief, coming to this realization made things a lot easier, I became more content. I realized this is something that will be with me forever, so now what? I continue to progress myself. \nIt's like buying a house. You know what's wrong with everything and what can be improved, but it won't all get fixed in a day. You have this house for life, you have the rest of your life to make it something proud of and to be proud your fixing it along the way.\n\nI hope these help and reach at least one person in a positive way.

            "selftext": "This is all over the place... I'm sorry ahead of time. TL;DR in the title.\n\nMy anxiety is pretty severe. I haven't had a job in years, I don't have a driver's license, and I haven't had friends offline since high school - and it won't be long before my 10 year reunion comes up.\n\nMy \"best friends\" live across the country. They know each other offline. I know them only through Facebook and an MMORPG. More and more lately, I just feel like I'm too different for us to relate to each other. I love them, we talk all the time in a group chat on Facebook and in-game, but so often, they talk about things like work, and hanging out, and things that involve money, and I just shut down. I can't contribute to any of that. I felt like I belonged for awhile, but now I'm not so sure. I feel like I'm weighing them down. I'm awkward. I can literally go weeks at a time where my only face-to-face interaction is with my husband. I make stupid jokes. I regret the stupid jokes. I have nothing to contribute to their conversations about being normal, functioning members of society.\n\nI don't feel like I can talk to them about personal things anymore. I'm terrified for our financial situation, but I panic every time I go to the \"job listings\" page for a local place. I feel worthless and out of place, I'm associating everything about this entire month with the loss of my grandmother and family dog and old teacher, and I just feel like I'm set so damn far apart from everyone, but I can't talk about any of that with them. Or to anyone except my husband.\n\nAnd that should be enough, right? It should be, he's my everything, I love him more than words can say. But there's something to be said about having *friends.* And I feel like I'm drifting away from them, already so out of place, shrinking, and by the time I'm done, they won't even remember I was there, like an ice cube in a volcano. Insignificant.\n\nWe can't afford treatment. I tried different medicines and therapy when I was a kid and they didn't really change anything anyway. I was on Zoloft for a little while a year ago, but the side-effects were so awful that I had to quit. The doctors treated me like I was a child who didn't know what she was talking about, and I left with a week of anxiety so bad that I had to have my mother and brother take turns sleeping over so I wouldn't be alone.\n\nI just don't know what to do anymore. They haven't said anything to make me feel like they care any less, or that I don't belong, but we're thousands of miles apart in so many ways.\n\nEDIT: Thank you so much for all the comments and support, everyone. It really means a lot!",

            "selftext": "Dear all,\n\nI posted this first in /r/depression, but it was suggested to post here.\n\nAs the title suggests, I have troubles making friends / hanging out. It makes me feel lonely, which prevents me from being satisfied with my current situation and makes me feel depressed at times.\nAs long as I can remember, I have had this kind of problem. I have always been a bit the nerd of the classroom (without being bullied a lot fortunately), and for a large part of my life, I have been feeling \u201cincapable to make friends\u201d. I remember myself spending more time on wikipedia as a teenager or playing chess by myself than hanging out with friends. My parents also used to tell me to meet more friends, but in those days, I did not realize the value of that. Back then, I did not dare to phone or text someone to hang out. It seemed just impossible to do, and thus, I spended most of my time feeling lonely.\nNowadays, I still have the same thing. I am currently abroad for a few months and especially then it is very easy to stay lonely. What I notice now is that if I am at a party for example, I dont dare to talk to a lot of people, especially groups of people. I tend to stick to the side of the wall, not daring to talk to a pretty girl or a nice looking dude. It is really annoying, because, if for whatever reason a conversation with someone does start, the person in question nearly always seems to like me and almost never walks off uninterested. Also, sometimes I hear that people describe me as being \u201csuch a nice guy\u201d...\nAnother example: my birthday is due. So, I want to hang out / celebrate with some people. However, I found it so hard and scary to actually pick up the phone and send the text message invitation to friends. In the end, I had a roommate helping me doing it, using the excuse that my French is not that good (abroad in a francophone country)...\nSo, I wonder: why the hell dont I dare to be more social? Why am I the person that nearly always stays at the side of the wall, in stead of embracing the party? Why do I question my abilities to be social so much that it prevents me from actually being it? And most of all: what can I do about it?\n\nKind regards,\nJdeb0",

If I felt he was a threat again, I would definitely speak up, but for the time being I don't think he deserves a label that he isn't currently guilty of (since I was the only one, and he has since changed his life dramatically as far as I know).\n\nSo, what I'm asking is, how do I cope with my anxiety is this situation? What are some tools that have helped you manage your stress and anxiety? \n\nEDIT: Thank you all so much for your advice and genuine concern. I just called my mom and she told me she will personally make sure he does not receive and invite.\n\nThank you all for giving me the courage to tackle this thing before it had a chance to tackle me :)\n\n",

We got talking about work and I found out she works as a secratery....\n\n...at the place I'm going to get my therapy session...\n\nTHe date went great and I really want to see her again. But I don't want her to know I'm seeing a therapist (not this early in the relationship anyway). I don't know what to do. Should I cancel the appointment I've been waiting for so long? Should I just take my chances and go in? Should I tell her about my issues? \n\nIts actually kinda funny how bad this coincidence is. Talk about timing eh?",

            "selftext": "Hello Internet. I've finally come to the point where i realize that I need to ask for help. This is a huge step for me.\n\nI have struggled with severe social anxiety for as long as I can remember. When I say severe, I'm talking 29 years old, been on 1-2 dates in my life. Yeah that bad.\n\nOver the last few weeks, I've entertained the suicide as a serious solution to my problem for the first time in years, and it's terrifying me.\n\nEven with my severe anxiety, I have been able to maintain what would appear as a normal life. I have a good job, I have a few pretty good friends. I think that I am generally well liked.\n\nI've never had a romantic relationship. I'm so ashamed of this that I don't even talk to anyone about it. None of my friends know, it is deeply embarrassing.\n\nFor my entire life thus far, I've been \"procrastinating\" on dating and meeting people. It's not that I don't want to meet people, it's that I don't even know where to start. Whenever I have the urge to start meeting people and someday finding a romantic partner, I just end up jacking off and putting it off till the next day.\n\nI've realized that I can't keep putting it off forever. I need advice on where to even start.\n\nOne of my problems is that I get so worked up, that I become \"paralyzed\". Whenever I start to have a crush on someone, my mind races, I imagine my entire life with this person, and I can't even muster up so much as a hello.\n\nI'm a bit put off by the idea of dating sites. I'm not some douchebag looking for casual hookups, I don't want to flirt with a bunch of people. I want to find a serious lifelong partner.\n\nI'm also hesitant to the idea of therapy. Whenever I've been to therapy as a teen, it always seemed like I was just being evaluated to see which medication I needed to be put onto. I've been on zoloft, prozac, seroquel, welbutren, and a few more I probably can't remember. None of these medications have actually made me feel \"better\". At best they've made me feel \"emotionally numb\".\n\nDoes anyone that's been in my shoes and found their way out of it have any advice on where to start?",

Here it is: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.moodtools.moodtools\n\nSpecifically, within the videos tool, there are guided relaxation videos and soothing sounds that can help you lessen your anxiety in times of need. \n\nThe thought diary tool can also be helpful as the research shows that sometimes you can just reason yourself out of your anxiety if you're stuck in a ruminating trap. \n\nFinally, research has shown that frequently, unchecked anxiety can eventually lead to depression, so you can keep an eye on your depression symptom level with the test tool! \n\nIf you have any questions or comments, please reply to this thread! I will be sure to get back to each one. I'm also happy to brainstorm with you further ideas for anxiety-based apps! ",
