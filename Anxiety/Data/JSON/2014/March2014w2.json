I don't want to write my papers because I don't want to spend hours doing research, because that leaves me less time to write. I don't want to pursue any hobbies because that detracts from what I need to do. \n\n\nI'm not even having fun in university/life anymore, I just feel scared. Even if I graduate, then what? I get a job and work for the rest of my life? Assuming I get a job? I have a Social Science major, I don't even know where I *CAN* get a job.

            "selftext": "Today at school, there was a bomb threat. I was just about to leave school because I was sick, I get outside to my dads truck when we see several emergency cars- police, fire, etc. I knew it wasn't a drill unlike my dad, and he wouldn't let me out the car to check on my favorite teacher so I went home and tried several times to call my friends to see what was going on and for someone to check on my teacher (she's like a sister to me, well call her Ms W). I pace around my room for a while, crying and struggling to breathe normally. I had the worst anxiety attack then more than ever before. I email my teacher, knowing it would be a while until everyone would be allowed back in the school, but I needed to do something. I was tempted to ride my bike to the high school to find my teacher; I was so worried about her.\nFast forward- this happened around 10am, at 12pm my teacher finally emailed me back. Everyone was okay, it was a fake from some punk student. Students were being picked up to go home and at 2pm, everyone was allowed backed to get their stuff. I figured I'd go back, even though I didn't need my bag at all, but I needed to see Ms W. I go there and get my bag and see Ms W. I give her a hug, saying I was glad she and everyone was ok while another teacher is in her classroom and she is crying for whatever reason (she's a bit emotional). Well, i have a big history competition tomorrow, I am a big history buff on WWII and was chosen by another teacher to go to a statewide competition. Well, I was excited until my poster went missing and I realized I would have to make another and on top of that I freaked out because I will have to speak. Ms W knew about me losing my poster yesterday and offered to help. As I was hugging her today, she asked me about the poster. I said I didn't want to go anymore, she told me \"You can do it!\" She always supports me. I thought about it for a while and while driving home with my mom her voice kept echoing on my head, she would always tell me when I am scared or say I can't do something \"You can do it!\" Or \"not with that attitude!\"\nSo I made up my mind, I will work on a new poster and go tomorrow. I will punch anxiety in the face and do my biggest fear- present. Ms W is my biggest inspiration, I didn't want to regret not going to something I will probably regret if I don't. I will \"Knock their socks off!\" As my teacher would say, and go in there and do my biggest fear. Ms W, thank you.",

            "selftext": "I recently turned 21, female btw. Sometimes, when I have a really stressful day, my mother will give me some of her Xanax so I can sleep that night. Over the course of 145 days, I have taken about 42 pills of .25mg Xanax. This is really the high estimate though, I think I may have actually taken less. Not all in a row obviously. I space them out, but not evenly. \n\nSomewhere around day 72, I took a three week break in which I consumed zero pills. I did not experience any withdrawal whatsoever. I stopped around this time because it was winter break and because I did not have school, nothing was stressing me out. So yes, school stresses me out BIG TIME. I'm in pre-medicine so it's a lot of work and competition.  After the three weeks, I then resumed randomly taking Xanax. In the majority of weeks, I'd take two per week. Sometimes, even one per week. **Again, this is the majority of the time.** \n\nHOWEVER, the past two weeks have been seriously stressful for me. I have taken maybe 7-8 pills within 13 days or so. I am really concerned whether I'll experience withdrawal, however minor it may be. Also, I don't want to ask my doctor about this because I know he'll be mad at both myself and my mother. \n\ntl;dr 42 pills of .25mg Xanax in 145 days. took them randomly. most of the time only took 2 per week.

            "selftext": "I have GAD and PTSD. Two weeks ago I quit a job I've been doing for just under 3 years. I got engaged in January and I'm moving from the east coast of the USA to Australia to be with my fianc\u00e9. My job was at a small office, and it was an extremely high stress environment. Since I've worked there I've stress eaten/starved. I lost 40 pounds and then gained 50. I would get hives from stress and get physically sick because of the way they treated me. I was doing the work of at least 3 people by myself and it was way too much pressure. I was disrespected and under appreciated every day. I finally reached a point where I cracked and broke down to my office manager and told her how they were making me feel. She was apologetic and was fairly kind to me for the remainder of my time. However, since I've left I've been getting daily calls, texts, and emails asking me questions that they \"desperately need\" the answer to. Keep in mind that before I left I trained my replacement, typed up detailed instructions on how to do everything I was responsible for, AND completed some things for as far ahead as September so they wouldn't have to worry about it. Yesterday it was \"we need the password to your email\". This was NOT a work email. It was lastname.firstname@gmail.com So I asked them specifically what they needed and said I would forward it to them but that I was not giving them the password to my personal email account. They claimed it was a mistake and said they thought they didn't have the password to the office gmail  account, which of course, they all do. Today I got a text \"we need to talk call the office ASAP\". No explanation, just the demand. Of course this means that I start going over every possible thing I could have done wrong in my head. Also, when I called them back they didn't answer. These daily questions and demands are making me sick. I may as well still be working there. I'm having trouble falling asleep at night, I wake up at 4 or 5am everyday with a racing heart and a pit in my stomach and every time they contact me I start to sweat and my whole body shakes, I get dizzy and nauseous and when it's over I feel horrible and exhausted. To make matters worse my boss had been my landlord so I'm still waiting for my security deposit and my letter of recommendation they promised so I feel like I can't just cut ties. There is only about a week left before I leave and they won't be able to contact me but I don't think I can take much more of this. If I keep answering I feel like I'm going to break down but if I don't I'm worried about what it might mean for my future. When I come back to the states I'm going to need another job, how will I get a good one if I don't have a recommendation? What if I can't use them as a reference? I'm feeling really terrible and scared and I don't know what to do.  \nI know this was long, thanks for letting me get it off my chest a little.  \nEDIT: After I posted this they texted me demanding that I call the office, so I did. The office manager, who I thought was nice, told me \"if you don't give me the email password he's not going to pay you. That's it guys, I flipped out. I told them in no uncertain terms that they were NOT getting my email password, I don't work there anymore so they shouldn't be calling me, and that if they aren't going to pay me then they can speak with my lawyer. I was their bitch for too long, I can't do it anymore. I blocked them all on my phone and Facebook as soon as I hung up. My mom told me to call the Board of Labor, which I'm going to do in the morning. I know it's naive but I seriously never thought they would go this far. Obviously I don't expect my security deposit or a letter of recommendation anymore, which is disappointing. I hope I wake up tomorrow feeling lighter and more free. Thank you all SO much for your feedback. It means the world to me that strangers would take time out of their day to help me. I'm going to try my best to stay strong. Huge internet hugs for everyone who read or commented.",

Regardless, I feel like this is a community where some people could possibly relate.\n\nAfter looking up panic attack symptoms, it looks like I could have had a panic attack. Or not. This was my first experience with anything like this, so I really don't know, but I couldn't find anything else it could be. It just seems odd that I could suddenly have one, but I guess there's a first for everything. Anyway, the story.\n\nAbout a week and a half ago, I had a bit of a freak out at work. To preface, I went in feeling completely fine. Granted, it was after a long and busy week, but I had gotten a good amount of sleep and ate breakfast before hand, as well as no more caffeine than normal.\n\nAbout an hour into my shift, I started getting kind of tired. No big deal, it happens. However, it was a problem for my job (McDonald's, where being fast is necessary). At one point, I guess I just didn't hear my coworker say he needed nuggets, because a way higher-up supervisor (who was doing an inspection of our store) roughly grabbed me and yelled \"they need nuggets, now!\"\n\nThis is where I went downhill. My face and hands started going numb and I started feeling extremely dizzy. I tried to wait it out, but after a few minutes it was clear that I wasn't going to last the remaining six-and-a-half hours of my shift. I tried getting the closest manager's attention, but I found I could barely speak. Finally, I managed to say \"I can't do this\" and communicated that I felt like I was going to collapse any second.\n\nThey got me to the break room, where I immediately sat down and busted into tears uncontrollably (harder than I've cried in seriously probably a decade, I didn't even know I could still cry like that). I was sent home right after that. I felt off and continue crying in my car for about 15 minutes before I felt comfortable driving. Not too long after, I felt completely fine again.\n\nWhat really worries me is that it will happen again. Like I said, it's never happened before. Nothing close has happened before, and it seemed completely out of nowhere. Does this sound like something that could reoccur?",

It lasted almost an hour.\n\nThis morning, after breakfast.... another panic attack. Same thing. I resolved not to give in to the frustration and fear, and allow the symptoms to subside. However... after some deduction I have narrowed down the stressor that seems to be the one thing different than the usual... excessive coffee consumption. Last night, I had had about 4 cups of coffee. This morning, only a single cup, and then boom; hot flashes, tachycardia, dizziness, sweating, a general sense of malaise and overwhelming fear. \n\nI'm positive that this was caused by coffee consumption. I will abstain from caffeine for then next 72 hours, and keep r/anxiety posted if I exhibit symptoms. I definitely think coffee is the culprit, here!  \n\nUpdate: Man, you really appreciate how GREAT it is to feel normal after experiencing a panic episode. For instance, my apartment is a place where I really feel happy. I keep it clean. It's old, but nice. Yet, last night it seemed dark and just bad. Everything is so bad when you have anxiety. I had truly almost forgotten how horrible anxiety really is. It's actually good to be reminded how awful the symptoms made me feel. I'll be a better nurse that way.
