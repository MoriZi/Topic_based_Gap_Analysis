            "selftext": "Hey /r/Anxiety. I need some help testing something. I've had panic attacks since I was a little kid, but this last year they got really bad. I started to see a therapist, got some help, and started to learn how to deal with them. Most of the time, I work on prevention through heavy physical exercise, (running), meditation, and muscle relaxation exercises. I got prescribed some Xanax for when the panic attack happened. But here's the kicker:\n\nI'm an [emetophobe](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emetophobia). I get panic attacks when I think I'm going to throw up. Since one symptom of panic attacks is nausea, it all just spirals into a cluster fuck of awful. Anyway, if my panic attack gets really bad, I can't bring myself to eat or swallow anything. So I am too afraid to take the pill that stops the panic. \n\nMy solution to this has been video games. Since I don't have my computer with me all the time, I\u2019ve been looking into phone apps that require excessive focus to take my mind off the panic attack. For the majority of the time, the app [Piano Tiles](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/piano-tiles-dont-tap-white/id848160327?mt=8) has worked really quite well. \n\nBut I\u2019m a programmer. I think I can do better. I want to create a game that is specifically for panic attack sufferers. That\u2019s why I\u2019ve been working on a game I call [Panic Pop](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.codeisscary.panicPop). \n\nEvery little detail in the game is specifically designed to distract your brain. Don\u2019t get me wrong, this is not a relaxation app. That sort of thing never worked for me while I was in a panic attack. This is something that\u2019s goal is to get you into that state of mind where you can only think about one specific thing. That thing should not be your triggers or your fears. It should be the game.\n\nThe game works by having these little circles on the screen slowly get smaller until they disappear. If that happens, you lose. Games over, but you can restart immediately by pressing one button. This serves the purpose of stopping the player/panicker from setting the game down. There is no pause button while in game. You must continue to play. (and not think about whatever is triggering the panic attack) \n\nAt the same time, you\u2019re relatively free to pick your own pace at the start. Every time you tap a circle it disappears, and one or two more will appear, meaning that you can go as slow or as fast as you want provided you don\u2019t let one of them shrink into nothingness. Meaning at the start, the game draws you in with a lot of freedom, and as the game draws on, it centers your focus. \n\nThe game also has a very simple color pattern of greys, browns and soft yellows. It\u2019s meant to be incredibly simple to pick up. There\u2019s instructions, but you shouldn\u2019t really need them. If you\u2019re in the midst of a panic attack, you need the game NOW. Not after 5 minutes of reading instructions. \n\nCurrently, the game is out. But, since I\u2019m really just one dude with a small laptop and a kindle, I don\u2019t really have the budget to really test it with other sufferers of panic attacks. \nThat\u2019s where you guys come in. I need you guys to test this thing out. Get it on your phones, and when you have a panic attack, try it. Tell me what you think. If it helps, great! If not, let\u2019s try to figure out why it doesn\u2019t and shoot me a PM. Or just reply to this thread. \n\nI will make changes to make damn sure it works. Panic attacks suck donkey balls. Let\u2019s get better together Reddit.\n\nEDIT: Wow, so this blew up a lot. Thank you everyone for your support and suggestions. The next update will feature new sounds (Probably [this one](https://www.freesound.org/people/junggle/sounds/30341/) and [this one](https://www.freesound.org/people/junggle/sounds/28826/)), hopefully with the option of changing between different ones. Thank you to /u/eudaimondaimon for showing me these! :) I'll also try to get an option that allows the user to change between different color palettes. I'm also going to try experimenting with the device on iPhone as well. If I can get something to run, I'll probably run a kickstarter/indiegogo for the money to publish it. If it succeeds, we'll hopefully see Panic Pop on iOS! \n\nFor now, share the game with friends, especially those who have panic attacks. Rate the game on the Google Play store if you can, that helps it get more publicity, allowing it to help more people! \n\nEDIT EDIT: So, if you would like to follow the progress of this game, or just see the trailer and some other info about the game, [I put up a page on my website about it.](http://codeisscary.com/panic-pop/)\n\nEDIT EDIT EDIT: New update was just pushed. Fixed the sound issue. Head to settings in the menu bar to change the sound. Much more pleasant :)",

Like, I expect to have a grip on my mental health within the next ten years. Am I going to be struggling with this for the rest of my life? Will I be taking mental meds until I die? Is this going to be a lifelong challenge, something to always be aware of? If not, how do I stop it from being that problem? Is there hope for us?\n\nEDIT: Wow, this kind of took off. Didn't expect that! I'm feeling better today, but still not great. I think I'm accepting that my anxiety will always be a piece of me, but then that leaves me wondering what I'm supposed to do with it. I feel like some of the responses here are a little typical, and that frustrates me. Others have been great, and that's good to see.

I couldn't say \"yeah, I'm capable of that\", because I don't believe I am and I couldn't lie.  Clearly the wrong things to say, but I was just so intimated and nervous.  I left the interview, went to my car, and broke down and cried for almost an hour while driving home and after getting home.\n\nI just feel like my anxiety is going to destroy any chance I have of ever accomplishing anything because I'm so afraid of everything and everyone, and any real responsibility.\n\nEDIT: thanks everyone for all the thoughtful responses.

Except I'm a lesbian so my girlfriend def has not gotten me pregnant. But in my anxiety spiral I decided that maybe my body just THOUGHT it was pregnant so maybe I should take a pregnancy test to be sure my body is not thinking it is pregnant even though it is not.

This quote is so powerful in meaning, I think it has quickly vaulted itself up to one of my favorite quotes ever.\n\nPersonally, I am constantly wearing a facade. I usually have a smile on my face and appear to be in a good mood, but I could really be struggling inside. Often times I wake up before work and feel like the world is sitting firmly on my shoulders. I carry this feeling with me to work, but nobody really knows what is going on. They see a guy that appears happy at all times. What they don't know is that I have been living with anxiety for my entire life. The smile on my face is not real, at times. \n\nSo, I know how I am as a person. There really isn't a need to be rude to people. It is not going to get you anything, and it could really have a negative impact on that person. I try my hardest to be kind to everyone because I know that I want everyone to be kind to me. Kindness breeds happy thoughts.\n\nMy other favorite one - \n\n&gt;\u201cFirst ask yourself: What is the worst that can happen? Then prepare to accept it. Then proceed to improve on the worst.\u201d\n\n- Dale Carnegie\n\nI think both of these quotes can easily be applied to the nervous illness, otherwise known as anxiety.\n\nAnybody have any other really awesome quotes to share?\n\nEDIT: Plato, not Pluto - oops.

I couldn't fill out online forms without my heart racing and my whole body turning to stone. **People would hand me amazing opportunities, and I would come up with any reason in the world to not jump on it.**\n\nI have no clue what triggered this anxiety. But it ruined my life. Overcoming it was a long, difficult road that started from the ground up.\n\nIn the past two years:\n\n* I lost 100 pounds. /r/keto\n\n* I quit porn and started /r/nofap.\n\n* Understood my addiction to video games. /r/stopgaming\n\n* I learned how to live in the present moment, instead of trying to relive the past or escape to the future. /r/meditation\n\n* A month ago I started lifting, which has done amazing things for my confidence and mind, as well as my body. /r/ketogains\n\n* And everytime I felt overwhelmed, I would ask this subreddit for advice. This especially helped, because I felt like I wasn't putting a burden on those close to me.\n\nBut even still, the only way I was able to break through, was with a lot of pain. One member of this subreddit suggested to me: **\"Just keep doing it, even if it sucks, and eventually it'll suck less.\"** And they were right. Repeat exposure helped me become non-outcome dependent. Panic attacks turned into something manageable. Rejections turned into ... Well, rejections, and they sucked, but they didn't destroy me.\n\nFor five years, five long years, I've tried to break this curse. And here we are. But this journey is faaar from over. This position is just a part-time retail position, and I have a bachelors degree that's collecting dust.\n\nBut one step at a time. When you start lifting, you gotta start with just the bar. I think this little job will help me grapple my social anxiety and allow me to start a new chapter.\n\nSo if you're out there, and you're in a similar position... And you feel cursed, broken, or just overwhelmed... Know you're not alone. **The path forward sucks, but take on the struggle, and keep coming back everytime it knocks you down.**\n\nThanks guys.",

How I'm going to handle my parents dying. I am so scared of dealing with that and it's just...*inevitable*. I'm growing up, about to graduate, life is changing, and I'm almost an *adult*. It's exciting, but also terrifying. I just want to curl up into a corner and return to my childhood where it was easier to be carefree. \n\nHowever, one summer about ten years ago was when I had my first existential crisis. It all hit me at once that people *die*. It was then I became absolutely terrified of death and dealing with it. I'm just so afraid of being lost without my parents. I wouldn't say I'm overly dependent on them, I just really love them and I'm off at school living my own life and I feel so fucking guilty about it. I'm so afraid of the day everything will come crashing down that I'm just living in fear right now. On top of that, I have some kind of stomach sickness right now, so I'm stuck in my house feeling like shit.\n\nI don't know, guys. When I think too hard about this stuff, I get panic attacks and they really scare me. I feel like there's no way for me to escape these emotions and they are slowly suffocating me.

I feel like I need a mantra, something to tell myself to ground me when I think I'm about to explode...but these thoughts are just like a big black cloud over my head.\n\nIt seems like I've had these feelings inside me for ten years, they just come and go.

Let's talk success.\n\nThis year has been a big one for me. I started therapy in January, and now have been diagnosed with ADHD and GAD. I'm on medication for the anxiety, and between the med and therapy, I've made huge strides. I feel like I really am taking hold of my life in a way I never have before. It's not that I'm doing anything fundamentally different... but the habits I've been trying to set all along are working, and my efforts are paying off. I've also lost 66 pounds (thanks keto!) and reconnected with distant family, as well as tried to re-immerse myself in creative pursuits that I abandoned when the anxiety was at its worst. This is my year of fixing and restoring things, and I'm kicking it in the pants!\n\nWhat about you? What successes are you proud of today?",

            "selftext": "First and foremost, a quick look through my submission history reveals my drug use. Mostly recreational, sometimes medical. In any case, I want to stress that I was stone-sober when I did this. I'm proud of that fact - I was just *me* when I did it.  \n\n\nI've only ever had one girl friend, back in the fall of 2011. We only lasted for a few months. At the time I was your typical conservative Christian, naive to the world, naive to the rights of women to their own life and body. I figured if I was dating a girl, it meant we were going to get married, have kids, etc. Naturally she was opposed to this idea because she was interested in exploring her own qualities, didn't agree that she needed to have kids, etc. At the time I was just ignorant to such notions because I figured it was our Christian obligation to follow a specific pattern in life (grew up Baptist.) \n\n\nAnyways, she ended up leaving me, at a time when I was already incredibly anxious to be growing into an adult. I know people like to rap on the Social Sciences, but they genuinely opened my eyes to the whole notion of world views, exposed serious doubts in my own religion, among other things. To say the least, I'm an entirely different person now than I was 3 years ago, and I *love* it.\n\n\nHowever, I've never quite been comfortable with the notion of a relationship as of late. I still liked girls these past few years, but I never knew *why* I should get into a relationship. How would I behave, act, perceive our relationship? The anxiety I got over thinking of this always seems to validate me never pursuing romance. \n\n\nIt is kind of liberating not feeling held down by the need to be loved or anything, but at the same time I still want to know what it's like. When in those instances I became interested in a woman, I could never make myself act. \n\n\nThis weekend, I was a groomsman in my buddies wedding. I helped them set stuff up only the night before the wedding since the rest of the week I worked. I had the opportunity to meet his cousin, a girl with the most enchanting eyes and smile ever. She lives in New York (3500 km away!), but I figured, *you know what, why not ask her out on a date. We've been talking and looking at each other for the past 2 days, live a world apart, and could probably do with the company! Worst comes to worst, we have an awkward date, and never have to see each other again.*\n\n\nSo I did. We were chatting, and I just asked her if she'd like to go get ice cream with me. I don't know if that's a casual thing or not, but I just shot it out there. Heart was pumping, I felt light headed, as I awaited a response. \n\n\nShe politely declined. She only gets to see this side of the family once every few years, so she wanted to spend time with them. I figured that's as good of a reason as any, and our conversation continued to what she was taking in school, where we'd like to travel, etc. She's only 18, and reminds me quite a bit of what I *used* to be like, which I'll admit was a lil' off putting, but I can't hardly blame her for being raised in a system similar to me. \n\n\nStill, I figured you only get the opportunity to ask a girl that good looking out once and a while, especially when she's as talkative as you are and keeps flashing her eyes your way. I went for it, and fell, but damn.\n\n\n**TL;DR** I *asked a girl out* for the first time in three years, completely on impulse. Made me feel like *fucking lightning.* It made me feel like I could *fuck* lightning. \n\n\nI don't know when I'll ever do it again. It's nice to know stuff like that can still happen though",

Mostly it's plans with friends but occasionally it's meetings with a client (for my freelance job). I am mostly open about my anxiety but it makes me feel so weak to tell someone that I am cancelling because I'm having a particularly anxious day, and I am not open about it at all with my clients (I worry that it will make me seem incapable of being reliable -- too many people misunderstand anxiety disorders for me to be too open about it).\n\nUltimately I feel bad that 99% of the time I lie about why I'm rescheduling/cancelling. I try to keep my lie benign enough that they aren't worried about me, but still. I worry that karma is going to kick my ass for it, though I hope that karma is able to see why I'm doing it -- not out of malice, but out of self-preservation.\n\nAnyways, can anyone relate to feeling like a shitbag for this?",
