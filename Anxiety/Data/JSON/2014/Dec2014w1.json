(i would delete mine if i wasnt studying abroad and far away from my family.they want to see my adventures and i want to build a better relationship with them as well. deleting facebook right now isnt much of an option at the moment.)\n\ndeleting instagram took a weight off my shoulders. i cant describe the amount of anxiety i used to have  years ago seeing what pictures my ex boyfriends would like of slutty girls, or who lied to me about what with what theyre doing, or if the guy im seeing is liking instagram pictures instead of texting me back. I had my instagram to prove myself i am worth of something, and living a great life now. FUCK that. nobody needs to know what im doing. this is my life, not theirs.\nDeleting facebook friends was even more breathtaking. ive made at least 200 friends from being in this school the past few months, and alot of them quite honestly i dont like. they either simply rub me the wrong way or, its obvious that they either see me as a threat or think im a bitch. lalala bye!!!! deleting all the exboyfriends friends, friends i removed myself from over the year was just so breathtaking.\n\nI cant do this to myself anymore. It wasnt healthy what i was feeling over social networks. im 24 years old and ive had fairly shitty things happen to me - but that doesnt mean i need to treat myself like shit. Panic attacks are the worst feeling ever and for the past 5 years i have suffered way too much from them. I know my triggers, and i know what i need to do to better myself. \n\nTheres so much more to life, and i hope whomever is reading this will understand that one day, too. :)\n\nEDIT : \n\nTHANK YOU for your kind words, everyone!! CHEERS and best wishes for an excellent new years for you, too. Through the mundane days and rough patches we all encounter, stay strong. More people care and are here to help more thank you may think. :)",

If the mods can edit the title to add a trigger warning for hypochondriacs that'd be greatly appreciated. \n\nQuite the title eh?\n\nAbout five years ago I started experiencing these weird \"episodes\". The first few occurred when I was in bed, just before falling asleep. They're really hard to describe, but they weren't painful or that weird, or even unpleasant. I just felt \"different\".\n\nLater on they started to happen more often, and would last longer. I would feel \"off\" for days, with periodic spikes of \"anxiety attacks\" where I felt weird, a little startled or frightened, and had feelings of [depersonalization](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Depersonalization) or disassociation. These would happen every few months, during or shortly after periods of stress.\n\nLast month I had my first full-on seizure. It was a [partial, or focalised seizure](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partial_seizure)... in fact my wife and I thought it was sleep terror, or a bad nightmare or something like that.  I went to the ER a day or two later, and after a CT scan, an MRI and an EEG a tumour was found in my brain.  I'm getting another MRI and a biopsy next week to get a proper diagnosis and prognosis.  It's probably cancerous, but curable. My anxiety attacks weren't anxiety at all, but minor seizures triggered by my tumour putting pressure on my brain.\n\nI'm writing this for the people who might be having \"anxiety attacks\" that don't quite feel right, that don't quite fit the descriptions they read online of what anxiety attacks are.

Does anyone else feel this way? How do I get out of this vicious cycle? I've tried Celexa, which stopped working after a year, Prozac, which didn't work at all, and Abilify, which made things worse in addition to making me feel sick.

            "selftext": "Sorry, I'm practicing my click bait article title skills.  \n  \nI've come to recognize three different types of anxiety I get. The cause? I still have NFI apart from it starting during an abusive relationship a few years ago. Triggers I've found so far:  \nGoing/doing something I don't really want to do.  \nToo much coffee ( I have one in the morning and decaf after that ).  \nNot enough sleep can go either way.  \nAngry people  \nPeople being angry at me  \nBeing late or lost  \nNew stuff, not knowing what to expect\n\nSymptom  \n**1 The general anxiety:** Would rather not sit still, faster heart beat, want to lay down and relax, feel like somethings wrong, hyper aware of surroundings or more-so, looking out for danger.  \nHow I manage it:  \nYesterday I had this when going to the city to stay at my gfs place. I didn't realllly feel up to it and by the time I got to the train station I nearly turned around and went back home. I took 2.5 MG valium, played some games on the train on my phone, and started to feel better after that.   \nOther things that would have helped it pass: Meditation ( A specific kind where I focus my mind on the parts of my body that feel stress ), listening to relaxing music, being in my room or another stable environment.  \n  \n**2 The wtf was that:** I get this sometimes for little reason at all, and it lasts about 10 seconds. I suddenly can't concentrate, feel not myself, space out a bit, feel a sense of dread.  \nHow I manage it: Look around the room, count numbers, look at the feeling. It always passes, but it really does feel like my mind is slipping away at that time. I fear that one day it really will.  \n  \n**3 Panic attack**: Fuck these to hell, and I'm glad I've only had three. Triggers, not sure. I had my first one whilst watching a movie, my second the day of moving, and third ( it was mild ) just trying to fall asleep one night. There's no pattern.  \nWaves of panic up and down, literally feel like you're on a crashing airplane, have to hug legs or keep your body moving as in rocking back and forth to keep myself grounded, immense sense of doom different to that of an anxiety attack and you really wouldn't be surprised if you did die. With anxiety attack you know it's silly and you won't. For me, a panic attack feels like I actually might somehow. Faster heart rate, waves of heat, maybe some sweat, tingling or numb hands, dizzy, faster breathing.  \nHow I manage: I don't. Holding onto something helps, or having back rubbed. I've heard many people don't like to be touched though. I ride it out whilst trying to remain calm, find a position that's good for me, occasionally changing. Keep something moving to stay grounded and outside of my mind.  \nA strange thing that happened on my mild panic attack - I think I actually willed myself out of it. I kept trying to break through that cloudy veil of bullshit that was suffocating my mind and I actually did. I felt like a weight was lifted from my mind and suddenly my perception of everything became somewhat clearer and more focused. Yeah wtf. Has anyone else done this?  \n\n  \nIf you can relate to any of these experiences, make a comment below! ( I'm practicing click baiting again ) ",

            "selftext": "I've recently gotten into meditation and it's opened my eyes up a little, in terms of emotions, specifically anxiety, and I thought I'd share some thoughts and tips. I can say my anxiety, these days is at a low point, and I plan on keeping it there.\n\nAnxiety is a feeling, it is not a personality trait. Unfortunately, some people get anxious more often than others, but that doesn't make those people \"Anxious People\". It might slip our minds sometimes, but anxiety is not who we are. \n\nI like to personify anxiety. I am simply a person, who tends to get a surprise visit from anxiety, quite often. But, that's all it is. I find creating that dissociation between YOU and anxiety is very important. The fact that you know you are suffering from anxiety, means that you know, that there are two separate entities here \"You\" and \"anxiety\". That's a fantastic start! Good job. \n\nWhat happens when anxiety decides to come say hi? Well, your mind reacts, and your thoughts start going all over the place, your body starts to react to it, and then all these lead to YOU feeling the full effects of anxiety. Now if you think about it, these thoughts, and these physiological effects, lead to your mind feeling the effects of anxiety, you are reacting to what is happening in your head and body.\n\nOne great exercise, I find, is the next time, you feel anxious, or on the brink of feeling anxious, I want you to scan your body, without judgment. Just observe. Try to paint a mental picture of your body, as it is in that moment, preferably with your eyes closed. \nStart from the top of your head, and work down to your toes. For example my thought process, during these scan are usually \"Hmm, eye brows are a little furrowed, eyes seem like they are concerned, or confused, Jaw is a little tense, my neck isn't stiff, my shoulders are a little stiff, but a tad relaxed, my arms and hands are relaxed, my chest is expanding with my breaths, and air is going in that direction, my stomach is fine, my legs are a little tense, but my feet are relaxed.\" You should get the picture by now. What I am doing there is simply seeing how my body is feeling. I am creating a physiological dissociation.\n\nNow that you've analyzed your body, and have a picture painted of how the body feels. Now, it's time to take a look at your thoughts. You are not your thoughts. You react to them, which creates a terrible loop! This concept is a tad confusing, but your thoughts aren't creating by you. They are created by your subconscious, your ego. The fact that when you think of something, and you know that thought is stupid and illogical, must mean that it isn't really \"you\" thinking that thought. If it was, then that thought would be dismissed instantly, as you know it is stupid and illogical. Just like thinking \"The sky is green\". Does that make sense? \n\nNow, a good exercise for dissociating yourself from your thoughts, is to label them. Nothing complicated. Simply, what is occupying your mind. Is it a thought, or a feeling. That's it. If you have a worry about something you are feeling, such as a feeling that your chest is getting tight. You label that a feeling. Don't dwell on it, don't over-analyze it. Don't attack it. Simply picture yourself putting a little sticker on it, that says feeling (of course, this is so much easier said than done, and gets way easier with practice). While, if you have a worry about a \"what if\" situation, then you label that as a thought. \n\nAgain, these exercises, take practice. Like anything, you will probably not be all that great at first, kudos if you are. The point is that you are trying, and I am proud of you. The better you get at these exercises, the more you are able to dissociate yourself from anxiety, and the more you realize that anxiety is a feeling, which comes and goes.\n\nA few other tips :\n- Try to notice when anxiety is there. Try to take into consideration that anxiety comes and goes, but we tend to notice only emotions/feelings when they are present and not, when they are not present.\n\n- When you are feeling anxious, and you are walking, focus on how the soles of your feet feel, with each step. Try to notice how the weight is shipping from the back to the front. \n\n- If you are sitting, put some of your attention, to the points of contact between your body, and the chair. Notice how your back is against the chair, how your waist and legs are feeling heavy onto the seat of the chair, and how your feet feel against the floor\n\nHope you are having/have a great day! You deserve to be happy, and anxiety free.\n",

            "selftext": "Title doesn't explain the whole situation but I'll try to break it down as efficiently as I can. I'm currently a medical student studying overseas and I failed a final exam for my year which now means I have to repeat that entire year in 2015. I will no longer be a part of my own cohort. I am finding it difficult to face this truth as I feel really guilty and helpless about the entire situation. This is basically the issue that has caused me to post this up here. \n\nBackstory:\n- Failed exams because 1) Family were being shit (parents arguing) 2) Close uncle (who raised me) died 3) Got put on SSRIs and had to change dose/brands 4-5 times 4) Haven't seen my family for four years due to financial constraints 5) Working 20 hours a week to be able to afford rent and food 6) Basically just a bad year when all things put together at once \n\n- Obtained special consideration for the exam but the medical school rejected it because the grounds of anxiety alone wasn't accepted pretty much - nothing I can do about this, it's up to them to accept/reject special consideration requests \n\n- Was given the opportunity to sit an additional exam for which I was told to study for x topics but then when the assessment was given, everything but x came up. When I showed the Dean the email showing the clear misinformation, they told me that there's nothing they could do about it. \n\n- Basically failed my additional assessment from misinformation causing me to have to repeat the year and therefore make my parents pay for an additional year of university fees (around 50k per annum) which is a time/money waste for them. \n\nThe issue: \n\nI am feeling guilty because I failed and I don't know how to apologize to my parents. Well, I did apologize but they told me not to worry about it but I am doing everything but that. I feel useless and helpless and I almost feel like I should quit medical school because I'm too dumb to become a doctor. I also don't know how to tell my friends who have always come to me for academic help that I failed the year and have to repeat. I was by no means the smartest in my cohort but I usually did pretty well except this time, life was not good so my focus went out of whack. I am ashamed of myself and almost cannot bring myself to terms with the situation. I don't know how to be positive about this situation and I don't know how to face my cohort and the new cohort next year because failing and have to repeat is such a taboo and I don't know if I can handle being treated like an idiot for failing BUT I also don't know if I tell them my situation that they'll think I'm just making excuses and am weak for letting my life issues affect my grade this badly. \n\nI have a caring, supportive, and loving SO who is helping me through this but he himself, does not understand the pressures of academic success and does not respond in a way that I can benefit from. I appreciate whatever else he has done/is doing but I require discussion from people who understand what it feels like to hit rock bottom. I basically was a High Distinction student my entire life (like since I was a kid) until now. This is the first time I've failed at anything academic related and because it has happened so late, I do not know what to do or how to face it and more importantly, how to use it as a source of inspiration to come out stronger. I am lost and I am wondering if I am cut out for any of this. \n\n\nWhat I have done so far to get help:\n- Free counsellors at uni have taught me CBT; this service is no longer available to me as it is uni break\n- Doctor has prescribed me SSRIs and beta blockers which have been working well until now; this service is very expensive for me because I am an international student so I cannot see my doctor whenever I please \n- Referred psychologist; cannot access as it is too expensive ($350/hour) \n- Parental guidance; complicated issue, they do not know how to help (dad is no longer affiliated with the family) \n- Brother; as above \n- SO; as mentioned, is trying to help but still doesn't quite grasp the issue of anxiety and academic success which isn't his fault but it is difficult to receive help \n- Friends; no one close enough for me to even disclose my failure to \n\nIf anyone is able to talk me through this and give me their experiences of having hit rock bottom and coming back stronger again,I would really appreciate it. If you'd like to talk to me personally, I am happy to chat via Skype.\n\n---\n\nTLDR - Former academically successful medical student fails an entire year from various stressors. Cannot handle the failure and do not know how to proceed and come out on top. Avenues of help have mostly been sought after but they are limited/expensive/unhelpful. Would like someone to share their story on hitting rock bottom and coming back up stronger again. Would like someone to talk to (skype is a possibility). \n\nThank you for reading. ",

I have generalized anxiety disorder and social anxiety disorder. \n\nCan we talk about the absolute strangeness and demented/ distorted feeling you get when living with an anxiety disorder. What I mean is... That feeling that things are not quite right all the time. Not quite the same as depersonalization episodes. Just always having to question your mind and how stable your thoughts are. Or if they make sense? I always feel like my thoughts are broken and scattered or... Confused. And those sudden moments where things around you feel warped and almost too real. A bit circus like. Like just overwhelming, strange, dream like and demented. It can be so sudden, where I feel like the world is huge around me and way too real and it always triggers an anxiety attack. It's exhausting!!! \n\nIt's very hard to describe... But I am hoping I am not alone in this and we can start a conversation that might help me and maybe others understand and lessen the fear of these odd experiences.\n\nThanks guys ",

I was completely engulfed in my phone for a decent amount of time. I enjoy my own company especially at this bar. I also love my phone and the shit I do on it. The guy next to me finally spoke. Mind you, I'm incredibly shy and don't put myself \"out there\" often. For some crazy reason the first words out of his mouth were \"What could you possibly be doing on your phone for that long? The battery has to be dead by now.\" I felt a bit put down by this, but showed him how well my battery was doing and said I was talking to my SO and dicking around on Facebook. He replied with \"You look like you use reddit.\" Again, thrown off and not feeling this guy at all since the first words out of his mouth weren't nice, I decided to shift things. I told him I loved reddit and lately I've been on it a lot. I'm actually amazed and incredibly confused by that statement. What about me says \"I use reddit?\" Does my appearance somehow convey sites I use? I'm SO confused by this. I don't understand how he'd know I do..\n\nI am shy. I have anxiety. I struggle to talk to people I don't know. And I really don't know how reddit got brought up. \n\nI honestly feel put down a lot because I don't \"please\" other peoples expectations of how to behave in public. I shouldn't have to perform just because so and so thinks it's the way things should be done. But honestly, it wasn't the only point in the night I felt low about being reserved. \n\nIf I stay home all the time, especially when events are happening, I feel even worse. I don't know what to do anymore. I'm tired of getting crap for being different. I feel stuck and super low. \n\nDoes anyone else struggle with this and what do you do? ",

It hurts being called weird and awkward. I don't want to be weird and awkward, I don't know what I'm doing that's coming across as weird and awkward, and my boyfriend isn't saying anything when they call me that. \n\nMy bf knows about my depression and anxiety, and when I ask him how I can better integrate with his family while everyone is chatting and laughing, he just says \"just be talkative and join in!\"\n\nBut it's not that simple for me. I worry about what I'm going to say, how everyone is going to receive what I say, what everyone thinks of my voice, what everyone thinks of my nervous fidgeting, what everyone thinks of my appearance.... I worry what they're all thinking when I decline holding my bf's recently born nephew (I have weird issues with pregnancy/childbirth/babies/baby-mom interactions), I worry that they'll think I'm even more weird if they knew I have panic attacks every time someone tries to pressure me into holding the baby (severity of the panic attacks ranges depending on who I'm around and where I am). \n\nThen I try to tell my boyfriend and explain why it's not so simple for me, but he gets frustrated with me and thinks I'm making excuses or just not putting in the effort that I could be. And then I usually just drop it with \"okay, I'll put more effort into it next time\", and then he can tell I'm upset and unsatisfied with how that all went and tries to talk to me more and apologizes, but I'm just like \"no no, no need to apologize, I'm okay! I can do better, don't worry!\" and put on my fake smile, which I seem to do way too often. And then I'll go cry later on, or push back my tears at the moment. Or just let it fester until something really upsets me and I let everything out (when that happens, I make sure no one is around. No one knows about my breakdowns or mood problems [I have a really hard time controlling my negative emotions in any way]).\n\nI'm so lost as to how I should deal with this. ",

However, when I make eye contact, or look at someone's face...I suddenly begin to lose that ability to comprehend what is being said in images. This causes me to derail my train of thought for my reply...and leads me to almost panic.  So if someone says to me \"My dog is furry, white, and is medium sized\", I would suddenly just NOT be able to process what is being said when I look at someone's face. It's almost as if my mind blanks out....and all the words that is being said loses its substance. Almost like the soul and meaning is being absorbed from the words. My mind is literally EMPTY, and my working memory has NOTHING to work with to reply. I do not understand what is said.\n     I just don't understand. I understand the importance of eye contact in developing a connection, but how do others do it? Do they make eye contact and simultaneously process what is being said in images? It does NOT make sense to me! When I'm riding with my friend in the car side by side where minimal eye contact or face gazing is required, I have the BEST conversations of my life and develop a connection. It's almost as if my mind associates more freely. On the flip side, if I'm sitting across someone from a table and am almost \"forced' to look at their face....my mind blanks out...I literally can't think, my thoughts get blocked...and I feel like I even disassociate a little bit. The conversation loses it's flow and I am left pissed off and confused about myself. There's a HUGE, HUGE disparity between my interactions with little face to face and ones with a lot. I feel like my brain wrinkles, and twists and turns...and my awareness plummets when I have to look at someones face. \n   I really need help...I really want to be able to connect with people, but it feels like I have to give something up; either giving up the importance of eye contact....or giving up the ability to express myself with my voice and mind. Has anyone gone through the same thing as I have? How have you delt with it? Also is there any tangible condition that goes along with this?My guess is that I am protecting myself due to my hyper-awareness. (I have recently gotten over my disassociative symptoms) Thanks! I really had to get this out.\n",

            "selftext": "1mg of Klonopin. 500mg Phenibut. 5mg melatonin. 750mg l-theanine. And I'm still feeling crushed with anxiety right now. Diagnosed with GAD, SAD, Panic Disorder, Agoraphobia. I just don't know what to do any more. I've been looking everywhere and I haven't been able to lower my anxiety in the slightest for months. It's the worst it's ever been. Aside from going to work (I work in construction, the end stages where you don't do much more than touch up the messes painters and the like leave behind. I spend about 90% of my time in an empty house), I spend all day, every day at home. I cut contact with my only friend about four years ago. I'm 22 and I still live with my parents and I can't even fucking drive. My biggest accomplishment within the past three months was ordering a pizza. *Online*. My stepdad drives me to work (he's the assistant supervisor at the same jobsite, and the only reason I have a job).\n\nXanax, Zoloft, Propranolol, Phenibut. None of those have had any effect except for those first few times I took the phenibut. These days it lowers my inhibitions a bit, but does nothing for anxiety any more, let alone my severe avoidance of, well, everything. The Klonopin does nothing more than give me that 'rubber body' thing. The Propranolol did nothing up to 30mg. At 40mg my heart rate wouldn't go past 60 (which would be fine if I wasn't at work, walking up and down ladders and stairs, hailing 70lb buckets of junk out of homes). Still felt anxious as all hell.\n\nI tried therapy. In highschool. I don't know if it helped. Lasted for a few months, I think. Don't remember her name. I don't believe therapy will help now. The CBT bullshit. I can't imagine a therapist saying something to me I haven't heard a hundred times before. \"People are more focused on themselves than they are on you.\" \"Your mistakes are much worse in your mind than they appear to other people.\" That doesn't help. God dammit, I just want some freaking relief. Give me five fucking minutes of calm, *please*. I need some god damned help. \n\nI don't know why I'm writing this post. I don't want sympathy from internet strangers. You know how people with anxiety are. Our self-esteem is so low that if we perceive the slightest sign of an attempt at comfort or sympathy our bullshit detectors go through the roof and we don't believe a single word of it. More than that, we trust the person saying it even less. I don't want commiseration. I want a solution. I want to know what I should try next. Medications. I'm desperate, but I'm not hopeless. I'm just very close to it.\n\nMy next suggestion to my doctor is to put me on a higher dose of effexor (on 75mg right now. Minor, minor mood boost but no effect on my anxiety) and put me on BusPar and Vallium (for emergencies). I have a feeling the effexor increase won't help in the sligtest, the BusPar seems to have more anecdotal evidence as being more of a sugar pill than a sedative, and the Vallium will just have the same effect as the other benzos. But I don't know what else to do. If this fails... I'm thinking of trying to talk my doctor into giving me an MAO-I as a last resort. I hope someone else has a better idea. Because aside from these, I'm out of them.",

            "selftext": "Today was my second shift in my first proper job. I'm only just 18 and have only just left highschool.\n\nI work in a bakery. I can already identify why I should not be working in a bakery. I'm quiet and socially awkward, yet they put me in front of the cash register. I have no interest in food whatsoever, yet I have to memorise 20 different bread and pastry products (that all look so similar to me). I'm terrible at money maths yet I have to solve sums in a rapid fashion. I'm quiet, reserved and generally the 'slow and steady wins the race' kind of person, yet I work under rapid, rushes and chaotic conditions. I have to annoy the adults every time I need to clarify what's what, or whether I've made this sandwich right, or what to do next. \n\nI've been given my next shift tomorrow. I don't believe the staff think I'm doing ok; I think they *hope* I'll do ok. Both the customers and the staff must get impatient. I really don't want to go back tomorrow because it's just such a stressful environment and I'm constantly doubting everything I do, because if I don't, I'll make stupid mistakes and be looked down on. I need this job as no other place in my town has gotten back to me, and I need the money for university next year. So I'm stuck with it. I worry from the 5am start of my day to the 10pm end of it. \n\nAnyway, my apologies for the lack of any kind of structure or flow here. Just a rant I suppose. \n\nThanks for listening. ",
