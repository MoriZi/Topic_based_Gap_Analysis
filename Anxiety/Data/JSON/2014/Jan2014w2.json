            "selftext": "I'm a recent college grad that's living away from home in a different city right now due to the difference in the economy and my focus in my career. Because I have no income right now, my parents are supporting me, but they gave me a six month limit to find a job because by then it'll be too much of a financial strain for them.\n\nI've been working on sending out resumes. The searching-for-jobs part I don't have any problems with, but tailoring my resume and sending it out has been very difficult to me. Worrying about what I'm doing wrong, giving a bad impression, afraid of getting stuck in a job I hate, afraid of failing and ending up (and being stuck) back home where there's almost nothing for me starts piling up in my head when I get ready to work. Very quickly, I start feeling sick, tired, and scared and sending out a simple document suddenly feels like I'm trying to push a boulder up a hill. I usually end up wasting most of the day trying to push myself to do this and, even if I do get something accomplished, I feel unsatisfied and disappointed that I allowed myself to be affected so much.\n\nI've been trying to take baby steps so I can get SOMETHING out, like calling it quits for the day when I send out three resumes. JUST THREE. And I have managed to do it once before when I was applying for jobs I didn't care too much about (it was just so I had something), but thinking about applying to the companies I do care about and the possibility of not getting any response back terrifies me.\n\nWhat I really need right now is some help to shift to a less harmful mindframe. I'm worrying about the worst and it's doing nothing but hurting my chances to send stuff out.  Anyone got any advice?\n\n**EDIT:** Thank you so much for the responses, everyone. I wasn't expecting this many replies so quickly. The advice and support from this thread is amazing and I'll be looking at it frequently when I'm sending applications and I need to chill out. As evidence from this thread, there are many of us that are in the same fight. I wish you all the best of luck with your search, and I hope this thread will be of some value to you.\n\n\n**EDIT 2- Day 3 update:** I want to thank everyone again for the help. Your support was exactly what I needed to get the ball rolling. Sending in applications have been getting easier. I've gotten a rejection response already, but I'm not letting it get to me. I still freeze up when a job description or a company's application process seems daunting, but rereading this thread helps me through it. I can get three applications out now without much hassle. I wouldn't have been able to do this without y'all.",

            "selftext": "Hey guys, \n\n\nI've posted here a couple times so I wanted to give a little update for anyone who cares. \n\nA huge part of my anxiety is being afraid of going places alone, specifically going into any kind of establishment like stores, coffee shops, the doctor's office, etc. The other day something motivated me to go to the store. I was feeling pretty relaxed, but I really wanted to buy some food. I didn't let myself get psyched out, I just did it. I told myself that if I wanted to leave the store at any point, I could. Once in the store I actually felt great. I didn't feel rushed or panicked and I took my time picking out my items. In fact, I even found myself smiling and feeling overjoyed and even interested in interacting with people. \n\nThis is a huge accomplishment for me because for the last several months I could only go into a store (or anywhere in public really) if I was with someone I really trusted like my boyfriend or my mom. I'm 20 years old, so this problem made me feel pretty ashamed of myself. I can't say I've officially overcome this problem, but at least I'm facing it and making good progress. I think what helped me the most was that I did it for myself, I did it because I wanted to, and I was able to logically walk myself through it, reminding myself of all the options I had. \n\nI just had to share this somewhere it could be appreciated. I feel a bit ridiculous telling people the \"news\" that I was able to make a successful trip to the grocery store. \n\nI didn't specifically set this goal or anything, but I do have some new goals for the new year and I think subconsciously I figured that if I want to accomplish all these other things, I'm going to need to conquer my fears of things like going to the store. So I wish the best of luck to the rest of you who are trying to accomplish anxiety-related goals. Try to get out of that mentality that you \"can't\" do it or that you will \"never\" do something again. Try to open your mind to the possibility that maybe you'll face your fears, and hopefully that will lead to the actual motivation and courage to do so. \n\nHappy new year!  ",

Basically, I was incredibly anxious about getting drunk and not being in control over my body and fear of throwing up.\n\nI am a common contributor with my non-throwaway account, and I was so thankful for your replies. I ended up drinking quite a few beers, but because I am a petite girl I quickly reached my limit. I took your advice and drank water and just relaxed. Although I didn't particularly like feeling dizzy/not in control of my body, I kept your replies in mind and realized that I'm okay. I'm not gonna die, I'm not gonna go into a coma, I won't become addicted from a couple beers. I did get sick after I came home, but I was able to calm myself down with the advice I got on this sub. I hadn't gotten sick in 5 years, so that was a big step for me to be able to control my emetophobia by taking deep breaths and realizing it will soon pass.\n\nThank you to this sub for all you do for me and the rest of the community. I am so glad I could have a great birthday that was relatively worry-free. I realize it was one of the biggest milestones, and I am so thankful I didn't sit around at my apartment because of my anxiety. I didn't let it control me; I didn't give the power to my fears.

            "selftext": "When I was sixteen I realised that there was something really wrong with how I reacted to certain things. I knew I\u2019d always been shy, slightly introverted, happy in my own company and a little neurotic when it came to wanting people to like me, but things were slipping worse than that. \n\nI had an obsession with death. I was constantly worrying about the death of a loved one and I treated every meeting with people like I would never see them again. Every time I was ill, no matter how minor, I was dying. An ulcer was mouth cancer, my acute anisocoria was a brain tumour and every pain in my chest was a gripping heart attack that threatened to extinguish me from existence, completely forgotten within generations. \n\nA year and a half later I began having weekly Cognitive Behavioural Therapy. Part of my therapy was recording ABC sheets. This was an exercise where A was the antecedent, an environmental stimuli; B was my beliefs and those combined led to C, the consequence. I was told that I could never change A so instead I needed to fix B. Change my beliefs. It wasn\u2019t easy going against 18 years of reinforced behaviour but eventually I began to make progress. We traced the origin of my condition to my mum\u2019s depression when I was a kid, which was catalysed by my skirmish with Christianity between the ages of 13-15 when I tried to turn to God to find assurance, but was told by the pastor that many people who I know would not be heading to heaven.  \n\nSo after ten weeks of CBT I was a changed guy. It was a glorious July when I finished the treatment. I used to bounce home down the hill in the sunshine after every session. I can\u2019t describe the feeling of euphoria as I grew stronger mentally. I thought I\u2019d put it behind me.\nAnd for one year I had, I had an excellent first year of University, I had the fresher\u2019s experience and met some incredible people. I was starting to think that all this was going to work out. I began caring less about what people thought, indulged in being a polemic (I should mention, I want to be a writer/journalist) and relished causing trouble and demanding to have the spotlight on me for once. \n\nThen for no reason at all, on the day I moved into my new flat, it all came back. All the beliefs switched back to the unhelpful default and I was plunged back into that paralysis. I struggled through the winter, often not being able to get out of bed through being so low with my condition. My then girlfriend and I decided to end it and I became reserved, helpless and completely distraught. That was rock bottom. Had I not had a totally crippling fear of death I would have killed myself. \n\nI struggled through to the end of the year, immersed myself in my studies and self-improvement. It felt good to be working towards some kind of grand narrative but the seclusion wasn\u2019t healthy. In the summer I began dating someone else and I resolved myself to get better again. \n\nI started taking a low dose of prescribed betablockers every day. I absolutely hated being on them as they turned me in to a zombie. It was like all my emotions were hidden behind soundproof glass. I went back to university as did my girlfriend and we broke up. I knew it was going to be the same story over again.\n\nBut only if I let it. This is the crucial part of the story. I realised that this was either sink or swim. I could break, I could spend the rest of my life talking about heartbreak and how my anxiety was the fault of others. I could live a life of \u201cif only\u201ds and I could end up being 50 years old as the man who could have been anything if life had been different.\n\nI don\u2019t know why, but I wasn\u2019t prepared to let that happen. So I began a lie. I told people I\u2019d got over my anxiety. I told people the betablockers had worked and it was time to try without it. *I chose not to have anxiety anymore*. It\u2019s been 4 months now since I\u2019ve felt any symptom of my disorder. \n\nMy point here is that, for me, anxiety had become an excuse. It had become a way of life, a defining characteristic and no matter how much I fought it, \u201cgot better\u201d or took pills to control it, as long as I knew that people ascribed that characteristic to me and for as long as I felt I could use it whenever, I was never going to get better. I realised the importance of stepping up and of being able to be strong.\nWithout the CBT I doubt I could have done this and I\u2019m not trying to say that it is just a matter of choice at all. I am saying though that no matter what demons you face, you are the common denominator. You are where it begins and where it ends and if your brain has the power to create a monster, then it also has the power to take it down.\n\n2013 I fucking destroyed my anxiety monster. 2014 will be my year. I won. May it be yours too, friends. Thanks for reading.",

As my wife and I read through the comments, there were confirmed fears, positive words of encouragement, and confirmation that we're at least on the right track on helping her.\n\nI can't even say how unbelievably happy we are with the progress that she's made over the past few weeks.  It's been unbelievably hard, with some painful days, and some amazing surprises.\n\nThe first thing that's happened is we were able to get rid of the \"fake drama\"  My daughter is really really intelligent and realized that if she were to show anxiety like symptoms we would often back down, give her time to calm down or change our plans as appropriate.  She was taking advantage of this.   Working with her counselor we were able to find a few signs that were the different between REAL anxiety and her FAKE anxiety.    \n\nArmed with this info we were able to properly discipline the FAKE anxiety.  All it took was 2 times getting caught and all of the fake anxiety is gone.   It is AMAZING how large of a percentage of her episodes were either fake, or were brought on by her getting herself worked up over the fake anxiety.\n\nAs far as school is concerned, this is a mystery.   Monday of last week was the worst day getting to school, I had to put her in the car, restrain her to put on her seatbelt, she screamed the entire way to school and had to be pulled out of the car.   That night was the first time she was punished for fake drama (we took away her American Girl doll, with promise she could earn it back)  Each day was progressively better, and by Friday she hopped right out fo the car and went right into school, no issues.   We're hoping in a few weeks we can get back on the bus!   Her attitude has been REALLY positive as she earns rewards for each step she makes further (the same reward system we were using before this week, nothing has changed on that front)\n\nNow we can work on the real anxiety.  She still is anxious about making decisions, clothing, food choices, etc. have all been minefields for her.   We've been able to pick out 7 \"safe\" outfits, so she doesn't have this overwhelming choice of clothing in the morning trying to put something together.   We've also been able to do the same with \"menus\" of sorts in our house so she can chose things like breakfast easily, again without getting overwhelmed.  Little wins have happened here though, she was able to pick out her library books at school without a meltdown.  \n\nIt's like I have my daughter back before all of this started, we're still working through things, and thankfully she's been more willing now to go in and talk to her counselor, and seems that she's now willing to listen and use some of the techniques she's being taught.  \n\nSorry it's another wall of text, but I'm just overjoyed with our progress and the fact that we can now WORK on it and aren't stuck in an endless loop.  I'm constantly fearful that things will come back on strong but now feel that as parents WE have some tools to better help her.\n\nThanks again!",

I was freaking out on the way to see her and I had a mild panic attack and couldn't stop crying but I forced myself to go there. \n\nI got put on Clonazepam(Klonopin) and Sertraline(Zoloft) to take daily, starting at pretty low doses and working my way up. I don't really know what this post is for exactly, I'm just really excited about all this....hopefully these will help me out a ton, and fingers crossed I don't get horrible side effects! ",

It's very short:\n\n**\"Don't worry twice.\"**\n\nTo me, it feels like a compromise you make with yourself. Ideally, you worry about things zero times. Realistically, you worry about things endlessly and repeatedly and reap no benefit from it. The compromise is to allow yourself to worry about any given concern once. *Don't worry twice* about anything. If you've already worried about it, you can tell yourself that you've already had your chance to indulge your bad habit in that particular case, and perhaps you'll return to rationality.\n\nJust thought I'd share in case it helps anyone.",
