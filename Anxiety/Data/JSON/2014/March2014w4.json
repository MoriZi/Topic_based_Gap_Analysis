I have panic attacks being around other people and I'm very pale so my face turns red very easily. I do take Sertraline 50mg but it doesn't do much for me. Anyways back to the story, I ended up walking the mile and a half to the clinic to get my dog the medical attention she needed while carrying her in my arms. Shes about a 10 pound dog so it wasn't very tough but I live in Arizona so I was sweating like a pig. I told myself that this was bigger than me and I needed to get up and do it. The walk there and back was harsh but it was very worth it. Sorry if its lame but I felt like I succeeded at doing something for once.",

            "selftext": "This is my second semester of senior year of college. Too much background would make this too long, but basically I got a swift kick in the ass yesterday in the form of almost losing my SO (who means the world to me and has been my best friend for almost 10 years now) because I have been completely out of control.\n\nThis semester I have tried to overcompensate for my anxiety and feelings of not having control by controlling the hell out of things I can control. Unfortunately, my boyfriend got stuck in that category and we had been fighting recently because my behavior was unacceptable and my anxiety was ruining our relationship. I also completely isolated myself and spent most of my time alone, avoiding friends.\n\nRealizing I was going to lose the most important person to me, and then talking to my parents and realizing I've been alienating them as well was exactly what I needed to make a change. As of tomorrow, I'm seeing someone weekly to talk about my feelings, rather than the student health psychiatrist I see once a month who just writes my Rx and sends me on my way. I'm tapering off Wellbutrin because these side effects have occurred since I added it to my Lexapro dosage. I'm also making a concerted effort to leave my house, hang out with my friends, and stop building walls around myself. And I did it! Today I spent time with 2 different friends, went to the school library for the first time all year, and went to the mall for the first time all year. My birthday is Wednesday and I'd planned to spend it alone or with one friend I felt safe around, but today I invited a bunch of friends I haven't seen to go to dinner for it- I was shocked how many people still care about my existence and wanted to be around me. And I find myself being excited about it (a little nervous about being the center of attention) rather than dreading it. Huge.\n\nI'm feeling so hopeful for the future. I really hope this inspires someone. I just needed to talk about how wonderful this feeling is.\n\nedit: today is also the first day I haven't had a panic attack in 2 weeks. That in itself is such a blessing and relief to me.",

            "selftext": "For the past three weeks I have been in my room, on my laptop and worrying about leaving the house. Before this I was leaving the house at least every three days to stop the fear of the outside building up and becoming terrifying. As the days went on I knew it would just be more difficult if I left it any longer. After staying up all night (I'm nocturnal at the moment) and working up the courage, I asked my mum to drop me off at the shop so I could buy a few things for mother's day. I managed it and I didn't die or faint like I thought I would. :] I felt like I was in a dream, and sitting in the moving car was absolutely bizarre and surreal. Stepping outside the front door was really scary, but the fresh air was really nice. I'm proud of myself but very jittery and anxious in the aftermath.\n\nMy anxiety has obviously been very bad for the past few months, and at the moment getting from my bed to the bathroom is difficult because I am so sure that I will faint, even though I haven't fainted in four years. I sit and shuffle my way down the stairs and it takes me five minutes which is ridiculous, but the dizziness and adrenaline I get when standing is too much.\n\nI know I'm far from being able to function well at all, but I'm just relieved that I've gotten that over with. :] I've had this disorder since December 2010 and this is certainly one of the most anxious times I've gone through. I have a doctor's appointment in 12 days (very scared) so I'm going to ask for help again. I've had many counselors in the past, a social worker and half a CBT course, but I'm feeling motivated to make it work this time. I don't want to develop any more bad coping mechanisms and would like to be able to do some of the things I used to enjoy. :] Most of all, I know now that I don't enjoy being lonely as much as I pretend I do.",

            "selftext": "I got good news yesterday. It was really, really good news actually, something I've known for almost two years might be coming, but I wasn't expecting it to happen right when it did. Everybody I told about it yesterday said, \"That's great! Congratulations! You deserve it!\" And reasonably, I know they're right.\n\nIt took me the better part of the afternoon yesterday to figure out why I wasn't excited or happy. I realized it was because I am deeply, deeply suspicious of it. I started to look back in my life and realized I've never gotten good news before, and times when I was really looking forward to something, it tended to get screwed up before I could enjoy it (for example, as a teenager I saved up enough money to go on a class trip to Greece, but four months before the trip my parents had to declare bankruptcy and I had to contribute all of that money to the household instead). Now I have this amazing thing that could mean an upturn in my life, and I can't enjoy it because I'm pretty sure it's going to go away.\n\nLast night I had a really complicated and frustrating dream (I've been learning how to \"read\" my dreams in therapy) in which things I was looking forward to ended up going horribly wrong. I was at a sandwich shop, starving, and as the guy was making my sandwich a giant cockroach crawled over it. Later in the dream, I had to put on a dress for a dance competition but when a friend helped me into it, it ripped because it was too small. Then, when I did the dance competition, I did so badly that the club I was in banned the song I'd danced to forever. After the dance, the childhood love of my life approached me and wanted to hold hands, but when I tried I realized my hands were covered in sores.\n\nI feel like one of two things is happening: my subconscious and my feelings are either telling me I can't trust this news, or my subconscious and my feelings are seriously screwed up and I need to just relax into it and enjoy it. When I really sit down and think logically about my good news, I don't see any realistic way that it will get screwed up. It might actually just be good news, plain and simple. I'm overthinking it.\n\nAnd whenever I think about it I get an overwhelming rush of anxiety. Just writing this post has given me the shakes. Am I nuts?\n\nEdited to add: I've been diagnosed with complex PTSD and suffered from depression for many years while in an abusive marriage. The good news is related to the divorce, which has been raging on for almost 2 years. So it's \"good news\" that's related to my abusive ex-husband, which adds a whole other layer of distrust and panic.",

            "selftext": "I suffer from anxiety and depression and have never really vented some of my frustrations before so this is very new to me.\n\nI grew up in a household where every day I was afraid of my parents coming home and the associated sounds: the sound of doors opening and closing, the sound of someone climbing stairs, shouting and screaming and the sound of slamming doors. You probably get the picture.\n\nI often distracted myself with music whilst at home to drown out a lot of the noise, however I could still hear the occasional sound through the music. For several years since I had suffered from mild auditory \"hallucinations\", hearing screaming and shouting in the background of my favourite music despite being completely on my own, forcing me to remove my headphones like I used to each time. These experiences have faded in recent years as I have stopped listening to the music I enjoyed at the time. In addition, certain sounds can bring me straight to anxiety despite how relaxed I think I am, ranging from panic attacks to short, quick shocks.\n\n6 years on and, although I've made progress with a lot of other areas of my anxiety, there are still certain sounds that stop me breathing and bring me to a heightened state of anxiety almost instantly. \n\nMost prominently these are:\n\n* Doors - Knocking, slamming, opening and closing, locking and unlocking, if its a door it will make me feel uncomfortable unless I'm the only one with a key. Even then, only if I'm certain its locked do I feel secure.\n\n* Stairs - The sound of boots on wooden stairs, although not common in my current environment, still causes me to panic and listen intently.\n\n* Shouting/Raised voices - Anyone arguing or shouting within earshot, even if they are just being overly happy and its obvious they are joking around with friends. I guess this could be described as a part of social anxiety, but the distinct part is the sound of shouting in films/television. I can't stand it in any form and, occasionally, almost hurts my ears (its an intense sensation of pressure) forcing me to turn down or mute the source.\n\n* Ringing Phones - The whole concept of a ringing phone can cause me to panic, even if it isn't mine. I begin to imagine the worst possible news waiting on the other side and often leave my phone on silent with the vibration off. Leaving only the visual indication of a call when I'm at my desk. If it's an unknown number and the caller ID is hidden I NEVER answer it. I also find the concept of answer phone messages hugely stressful to deal with.\n\nSorry for the ranting, I tried to structure it so at least it's easy to read. It's been very helpful to find somewhere to vent these frustrations. \n\nToday I was trying to attend an Optician's appointment and a fellow in the waiting room had a ringtone of screaming voices. He didn't manage to answer the phone in time and it rang several times before he could get it out of his pocket. He looked metal (long black hair and leather coat with studs) so I guess that's his thing but it set me off today and I haven't been able to relax since. It was a complete shock to me and I don't think I've ever heard something like it before, I wanted to just run out of the Optician's. I guess this is one of the reasons I felt the need to post this.\n\nFeel free to post anything in the comments section, any advice or recounting similar experiences are welcome and appreciated.",

            "selftext": "I was sitting in my chair with my gf and showing her dumb videos on youtube. She was on my lap and I decided to lift her. Shes pretty small about 5'4 and 120-130 pounds and I lifted her and I got a weird feeling. This was like 130 am saturday into sunday night. My head started hurting and it still hurts. Now im worried like theres bleeding in my brain/a small rupture that will lead to a bigger one soon. i had a MRI done to due migraines and they found I have like a hypoplastic vein that has been there since birth. I took advils and it hasnt really done much. Its not a whole lot of pain, because from what I read anuerysms and that kind of stuff result in extremely severe headaches that people describe as the worst of their life which is not the case for me. I know there are such things as exertional headaches and stuff\n\nI did a report once about this guy who helped start the movie business and while reading his bio it said his dad died from a burst vein in his head/ blood poisoning. He was lifting something heavy...and I remembered this and I freaked out. I went to sleep but I woke up and it still hurts. It sorta comes and goes but its still there.\n\n-I did have a headache BEFORE this happened but it was comparetively mild to this. I do have migraines as well but they have been quiet since.\n\n\n-I am on 0.5mg of Klonopin once a day, down from 3 times a day a month ago so im tapering off.\n\n\n-I drank one beer which made me pee a lot and if I hold it sometimes it makes my head hurt. ALso mabye the beer interacted with the klonopin?\n\n\nSo there are a few factors at play here. anyone got any similar stories of stuff like this happening to them? I had to freaking google my symptoms and came across a scary huffington post article. It freaked me out.",
