I promised him we'd hang out once my work schedule let up in the winter.  \n\nI never knew he had anxiety.\n\nI've dealt with it myself for years.  \n\nI found out that he was given medication at a doctors appointment that day...I guess he decided there wasn't enough time for it to work.  That's the hardest part of this for me.  There was hope in a bottle...sitting right in front of him.  He was just in such a dark place that there was no way for him to feel he could get out.  I knew that feeling once as well, but suicide was never the answer for me, despite me not wanting to live with the feeling of dread anymore.  Luckily a doctor gave me medicine and it worked for me.  To this day I am doing much better.  \n\nIf only he had waited...We could have had more one on one conversations.  I could have helped.  I wish things had gone differently.\n  \nThanks to this sub, I got through some hard times.

            "selftext": "Sometimes at night I just get really anxious for virtually no reason. I have a fear of current events and the potential negative impact they may have on me. I frequently have panic attacks when I read about a current event that scares me. I usually get over it once I read past the sensationalism of the media and understand what the actual problem and most likely outcomes are. However, eventually after having anxiety about lots of different things over the course of a period of time I will just start to feel nervous. There are 7 billion people on this planet and there will always be something scary going on, I understand that. Still, I can't help but check the news every few minutes. I feel like I'm trying to find something to panic about. This isn't really a problem as much as a nuisance as it never really continues past one or two nights and I move on with my life. \n\nHere's basically my process of anxiety:\n\n1. Something scares the living sh*t out of me\n2. I worry about that for like a month\n3. I find inner peace and understand I can't do anything about it\n4. During my recovery process, I usually find other things to give me anxiety about. I slowly get over all of those things.\n5. A week goes by and they slowly creep back into my mind and lose my inner peace and have mild panic attacks at night a lot.\n6. Eventually I finally move on and regain inner peace and live my life.\n\nThis always happens in the fall for some reason and ends by usually mid-December. I feel like my anxiety makes an itinerary every year and if I don't feel anxious during a time I'm scheduled to then it'll give me something to worry about. Right now I'm experiencing step 5. Does this happen to anyone else? Is there any recommendations you have to make this process shorter or less stressful?",

            "selftext": "I've been seeing a therapist (LCSW) for a couple of months now. I think she's very good, and has been helpful so far.\n\nLast night, I came to therapy with the same litany of problems - immediate, near-sighted problems: Worried about a possible new relationship, worried about sexual performance, stressed out by work and life in general.\n\nRather than go over the details of what was bothering me that minute, she asked me a lot of questions about the past (not in the much-parodied psychoanalytical \"tell me about your mother\" way, but more like, \"What was it like when your father died?\" \"How did you react to it?\").\n\nAt first I was thinking, \"Hey, I've got real problems *right now* that I need help with, and you want to talk about ancient history?\" But I went along with it, and the things that unfolded painted a picture of times that contributed to the pessimistic, everything's-going-to-go-badly-so-why-get-excited-about-anything sort of state I've found myself in.\n\nI began to see how I gradually built up this armor in reaction to disappointment or loss, and how I've come to see nearly everything through the lens of anxiety (and/or depression). Sure, certain life events (new relationships, money, work) bring up certain feelings, but it seems like my reaction to those events is fear and avoidance, rather than a real effort at seeing things from different angles and attempting problem-solving (or acceptance, even).\n\nI felt pretty inspired after leaving and went and bought some canvases so I could make an unrestrained mess of a painting for an exercise in being free and less controlling. I washed all my dishes, and did 15 pushups. Later, the anxiety returned, but I am hopeful that I can learn to manage it and live something like a full life.\n\n**TL;DR**: I think I trained myself to be withdrawn and controlled in a reaction to stress and loss in life, and have been robbing myself of feeling free and open.",

So with that thought process my wife and I are going to make some digital ones with just some words of encouragement and some facts to calm and remember that it is just an attack.

            "selftext": "25/M - I just realized that I'll never be like them. I can't even go into a shop without getting stomach cramps. I try to hide this and force myself to go out and be with my friends but they usually go out to pubs and alcohol just makes my symptoms worse. Like right now, I lost a day to hangover and I'm just sitting on my bed thinking \"I'll make it tomorrow, I'll get up early, go for a run, I will meditate and start looking for a job!\" ...but this is going now for over a year.. Always tomorrow.. and even if I'll able to make a daily routine, I can't see myself in the future as a functioning human being.. everytime I need to talk to strangers or go into the city I feel anxious to the point where I start to shaking. And the worst thing is that I don't have a reason being this sensitive.. I think if I could identify a trauma in my childhood then I'd have a starting point to manage my condition. But as far as I can remember I was always this anxious.. \n\n\nIn this year I barely left my room, everytime I have motivation it quickly turns into frustration. I feel the need to get a job, I need to get my drivers license, but I can't even think about these things without getting anxious. Even my hands are shaky right now. My mother is really supportive and gives me everything to feel myself better, but I don't want to use her, sometimes I feel guilt, sometimes I feel like a failure. I was diagnosed with mixed anxiety-depression a year and a half ago, but I hated the meds and my psychiatrist, I told everyone that I'll be okay I just need time. But now I feel like an outsider, not a human being. I feel like I'm an observer. I feel shame and I don't know why. \n\nThank you for listening, I just needed to get this out of myself. Though I don't know the solution, it feels better already. Sorry for any mistakes, english is not my first language. ",
