So I had to sit at an already existing group asking if I can join. I could. One dude was randomly looking at my laptop and saw my Attack on Titan wallpaper. That's the moment we just started talking. I even had someone to sit next to in the train! (I usually kinda avoid contact with his \"group\"(and people in general), because social anxiety and shit.) We talked about anime and we even watched the same ones, and we could recommend each other shit. He even was talking about a convention **we** could go to if I wanted! This shit is normal for like 99% of everyone, but this random interaction made me feel nice for a bit.\n\nEven though I still daily just want to bang my head against the wall until I pass out because of my anxiety, today was not that bad.",

I hope meds will work for me or some therapy will change me.

I don't know if it has anything to do with the mirrors or bright salon lights. Does anyone have any experience or advice for this kind of situation. Thanks alot.\n\nEDIT:\nSo, this post has gotten a bit more attention than I thought it would which is good because we can help each other and find ways to overcome the situation. Thankyou everyone for your responses. Just to let everyone know when I do go and get my haircut I take some benzo's (doctor prescription) to help me. Because I try to take benzo's as little as possible it has a much greater effect when I do take them. If I didn't have the Benzo's I don't think I could go to the Hairdressers. I'm thinking of hiring a hairdresser to come to my place instead of me going to a busy place where I'm trapped. If anyone has any other ideas or tricks to deal with this situation post them to help other people who might read this. Good Luck and stay strong!",

I felt like I could never find the right thing to say and I always felt surprised and off-guard when social encounter would unfold suddenly.  This caused a lot of dread and anxiety about social situations.\n\nHowever, a couple months back I was diagnosed with ADD due to my troubles with concentrating in the harsh environment of university schooling, I was put on Vyvanse and something really interesting things happened.\n\nAll of a sudden social situations were manageable, I could predict the flow of conversation and really engage with the dialogue.  I didn't lose my trains of thought, I was able to make coherent thought out responses and since then I have begun to relish and seek out social situations, and yes even prosper in them.  I am still somewhat making up a bit of a social deficit from being less socially active than I would have been, had my ADD been treated, but I am rapidly making up lost ground.  I implore you, if my story sounds like you to be evaluated for ADD, I wish I had sooner.  \n\nTL;DR The reason I had social anxiety was not because I had \"anxiety\", but because I have ADD and if left untreated can make it difficult to function in social situation, and thus stress provoking.

            "selftext": "I have suffered from anxiety ever since my sophomore year of college, which is now about six years. Which is a really long time now that I think about it. I smoked pot for the first time (and last) and ended up on campus in full panic attack mode. I saw someone I knew by chance and had him drive me to the ER, where I was berated by nurses for the entire length of my panic attack (around 4 hours). \n\nSince then it's been a wild ride of medications, therapy, and friend support. I'm current off medication and not going to therapy ever since I moved to Canada from the US. I get health insurance next year but I'm not sure if they cover therapy. \n\nBut the point of this post is that my GAD has slowly evolved into hypochondria. I fear having a heart attack when I wake up in the morning (I'm 26). I fear aneurysms, brain amoeba, HIV. My aunt had Hodgkins lymphoma when she was in her mid twenties so I also fear that. \n\nIt's become a situation where I'm afraid all the time again. I'm not in fill panic mode like the year or so after my firsr panic attack. That was truly awful. But now it's more insidious. It can't ever be happy because I think, oh crap, was that heartbeat a sign of a heart attack? Is that pressure a heart attack? Is this headache brain cancer? And so on. \n\nAny tips or encouragement or advice would be extremely welcome. Thank God this subreddit exists. You're all amazing people and it comforts me to know I'm not alone. ",

After spending $40,000 on obtaining a degree in Social Work, I have discovered that this field is absolutely incompatible with my anxiety disorder.

Here I am, jobless at 26.\n\nI am stuck.  My passion is to help others, yet this requires me to be out on the front lines, planning, implementing programs, coming up with solutions, etc....all of which is impossible with my anxiety.  I have discovered that I thrive better in office-type environments, where there is structure and repetition and  little to no room for errors.  Yet, I do not find these type of jobs fulfilling .

Then she got internet buddies of hers to send me hateful emails. I retaliated in kind through emails - it was way too much pressure and I lost my cool. By losing my cool I mean standing up to her and sternly telling her to shut up. That's it. From a distance of a few metres away. \n\nI locked myself in the room afterwards. It's been 3 days of her insults, and I had a few breakdowns - took way too much clonazepam on one of those, but just fell asleep and woke up very late, only to sleep again. \n\nShe's flying to the UK on the 27th. It's been over 1 year where I felt emotionally abused and stepped on, and was treated like garbage. And yeah, I still do love her, but I know that she is evil and is just out to cause damage. I would never ever hurt her though - it's not in my nature. What I did do is put a mirror in front of her through emails, so she could see who she is and the damage she caused, preying on the emotionally vulnerable. I was in my room and she was in hers.\n\nNow she found a lawyer for the divorce, and wants me to pay for it, which I won't because I must find another place to live. She'll most likely pay for it herself, but even if she does, I fear a massive breakdown in or before signing that piece of paper. Any advice would be welcome.",

I usually rub small amount on my wrists or on the back of my neck.
