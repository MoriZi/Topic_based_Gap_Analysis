My fianc\u00e9e love going to the movies and I used to, as well, but it's become such a miserable event I just can't. We both love camping but it's just too stressful.\n     So, I have decided to do something extreme and face this head on. \n     I work in an elementary school and get a spring break. It starts tomorrow. Today, after work, I am having my dad drop me off at the Ouachita Trail trailhead and am spending then next ten days backpacking alone. I am going to spend this time trying to get a handle on my anxiety and hopefully come out the other side with at least a little perspective. I don't expect it to fix me but I at least want to see that I am stronger than my anxiety. \n     I packed my backpack last night and had a small attack. When I laid down for bed and turned out the light I had a major one. I'm terrified. But I don't want to be. Camping and backpacking has been a huge hobby of mine for my entire life and I'm tired of not being able to do it. You all have given me a lot of hope, support, and company through some really bad attacks and I'd love to hear what you think and maybe some encouraging words. \nI love you all and I'll let you know how it goes.",

            "selftext": "I'm a man of 38 years old, I knew what was going to happen if I went to the doctors, thus the reason why I never went, it was about appealing as a gas chamber.\n\nI've suffered from anxiety for years, eight years I think, the problem with anxiety is that as you all know, it's such a horrible illness that it stops you seeking help, you'll do ANYTHING just to avoid ONE panic attack, going to the doctors ... LOL .... not a chance, EVER. That is the one place you can't escape from, the one place where you have to be honest and truthful and the one place you'll feel uneasiest, more than likely with a full on panic attack, AND you get the joy of sitting in the waiting room for 10 minutes first!! \n\nUnfortunately for me, I made a deal with another anxiety sufferer that if she gave up the cigarettes, I'd go to the doctors. \n\nToday was the day that I HAD to go, phoned at 8am, still in bed, expecting an appointment in the afternoon, Nope, got through at 08:15, only appointment available 08:40!!! I was still in bed! Bath on, raced downstairs and took 400mg of magnesium and a handful of kalms, 1000mg of vitamin C, and an aniseed ball for the sugar, no time for breakfast. Out the bath, ironed jeans, 08:30, this was good, it gave me no time to panic, out the door 08:35, had to run half a mile to the surgery, it sucked, I'm a cyclist not a runner, got there at 08:40.\n\nSat in the waiting room, gradually becoming more fidgety, anxiety building, sending texts to my friend begging her to chat to me to bring me down, she never got them, holding it together I sat there. I hated it. Next thing I know my names called out. \n\nI was fine, I had rehearsed what I was going to say. Walked in, shook her hand and happily declared I wasn't contagious.\n\n\"Hi, I've had anxiety for eight years\".\n\nShe slumped back in her chair and looks concerned. The happy face went instantly. My meltdown started, shaking and voice trembling, she could see I was in distress as I tried desperately to hold it together, It really sucked, but it was a release ... She listened to me, a 38 year old man with tears in my eyes begging for anything to make it stop.\n\nI have very little memory of the consultation, came home with Sertraline and Proprolol.\n\nMoral of the story is, if you have anxiety, you ARE going to your doctors, it really was a shitty experience, but it's your only option to get better. Having a breakdown infront of your doctor allows then to see how serious it is, she looked really concerned for me. Don't know how she did it but when I walked out there was a nurse outside the door, I'm pretty sure she was called because I looked so unwell and on the verge of collapsing. \n\nEight years of fun coming to an end. I'm going to get better. :)\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

            "selftext": "Just remember:\n\nLeft side is heart problems. Right side is stroke. If you can feel yourself scratching your arms and legs, you're fine. Periodically check if you're feeling anxious. You're going to be fine twenty minutes from now. That's because if you're scratching yourself, and/or reading this right now, you're freaking out about it. \n\nTake a few deep breaths, slow ones, and come back. I'll wait. \n\n...\n\nOkay. Can you feel the scratches on your skin? Don't over-think it. Either you feel it after your hand is gone or you don't. If you can feel, then you're not dying. And if you're not dying, then, you've faced the concept of impending death and lived. And if you've faced the concept of your impending doom once, you can do it again. \n\nYou won't die today. There isn't anything internally wrong.\n\nTake another deep breath.\n\nExhale slowly. Concentrate on the exhale.\n\nI, myself, have been through this many times for many years. I'm still alive, and you will be, too.\n\nJust keep inhaling and exhaling slowly, for now. \n\nWhen you're ready, we'll move on.\n\n....\n\nOkay, now that you're ready to move on, think about what you want to do. What makes you comfortable? If it's surfing reddit, get on that. Social contact? Get a hold of someone. You've found your center, and now it's time to stabilize. Let's just find the thing that gets you where you need to be, alright?\n\n...\n\nIf you're still reading, you didn't find your calm. That's okay. Sometimes it's not so easy to nail down what kills that attack. Sometimes, it seems like there's nothing that can stop your imminent death. I know how that goes. \n\nAt this point, what works for me is *actively* trying to distract myself, but when I think about it, I check all of my limbs to make sure I can feel them. If I can feel my limbs, I'm not having a heart attack, I'm not having a stroke, I would have felt an embolism beforehand with a persistent generalized pain over more than a week, and I'm not smelling blood or anything burning. \n\n...\n\nThere are a lot of things *I* do when I have an attack that may or may not help others. I just wanted to jump in and let others know that *you are not going to die*. Your body is just freaking out either because you're thinking too much about it's functions or, like me, it's just gone haywire and you have this unshakable feeling that you're going to die.\n\nIf you're still here reading this, then, you're preparing for an attack, or nothing has worked so far. This isn't a last resort, so much as it is a \"bodily reset\" sort of thing.\n\n**Breathe deeply three times. On the fourth time, tense all of your muscles. Hold your breath and your muscles for a count of four or five. The count to hold is up to you. After this count is up, release your muscles and exhale slowly. Repeat this as often as you need to.**\n\nFor me, my doctor says it's a misfire of my \"fight-or-flight\" response, so I get super-stressed. Tensing and releasing muscles can help that.\n\nOkay. I've rambled. I'm sure a lot of this has been covered before here. Just remember, take a few deep breaths, and, actually, even IF you were going to die (which you won't, trust me) John Coyne is probably a good dude to relax to if you're going to go out due to stress :)",

Scared to have to push through another day of being anxious about everything, being depressed, having to work, study, be in crowded places etc. I literally just stay awake till 4am keeping myself awake because the more I am awake the longer it seams till I have to complete the tasks of everyday life. Any one else have any advice or experiences with this?",

            "selftext": "About two years ago, an old friend of mine \"re-emerged\" after fighting an eating disorder for about 8 years. She had been in and out of hospitals, and lost touch with a lot of people. It has been great seeing her and talking with her again, especially since I was diagnosed with Anxiety and Depression during the time she was gone. It's nice to have someone who struggles with similar things to talk to.\n\nHere's the problem: she fishes for people to tell her that she is beautiful. Some examples are complaining that people are calling her fat and asking if she is pregnant, something no reasonable person would ask someone who is 110 lbs. She talks about how upset she is with the weight she gained before summer and it takes every mental tool I've gathered to not cry, scream, or just hit her. \n\nI understand that her thoughts are like mine, something that she cannot control and something that she struggles with everyday. I've tried to reach out to her and talk about the tools I have gathered and how to use them, but she is unwilling to listen.\n\nI'm at a make or break point - what should I do?\n\nP.S. This is my first time posting to /r/Anxiety and seeing the \"Breathe. Everything's going to end up fine.\" and \"Deep breaths. You are okay =)\" put a smile on my face\n\n**Edit:** Thank you so much for your response, they have been incredibly understanding and supportive. It looks like I need to be frank with her about how she affects me and the people around her. If she doesn't improve and/or listen, than I will disconnect and not make the effort to be around her while still responding with kindness if she reaches out to me.\n\nThank you, again",

Overall I just felt out of the loop. I've had issues with some toxic friends as well. I would freak out over messaging anyone and my social anxiety would often prevent me from going out to the point where most people would stop inviting me to go hang out. Then I realized those weren't really good friends. \n\nI've had a new set of friends for a while relating to my hobby and I would always freak out about how to reply to their texts or what to say if I couldn't make it to something. This would often result in not replying at all. My mom said 'They're your friends, just reply to them\". That's it. Good, true friends shouldn't judge you by a text. They will support you during rough times, not just ignore you and stare at you like you are a weirdo (which happened w/ toxic friends). They should be nice and non-judgmental even if they don't necessarily agree with your viewpoint.\n\nI'm still afraid I'm being a bad friend. I've been conditioned for too long to be unfeeling to protect myself and I need to change. I've built myself a wall to keep out the bad guys and now it is keeping out the good ones too. \n\nPart of the reason I'm seen as the nice, shy quiet kid is because I never show any emotions-anger, irritation, happiness-it just all reverts into either anxiety or sadness. I need to show these emotions every once in a while, I am human after all.",

            "selftext": "My husband has been distant and not himself for the last two weeks. Today we talked about it and he told me that he cares about me as a friend, but that he has stopped loving me.\n\nI am devestated, I have been crying uncontrollably for hours. I am having rolling panic attacks. I can't breathe. I feel that my heart has been broken.\n\nI am so scared of what this means. When we were talking he said he wants to see if we can work on it for a while and see what happens.\n\nWe have two young children and I moved with him for his job to the other side of the world from where all our families are.\n\nMy body is dumping on me, I am throwing up and and my stomach is upset.\n\nI have to get up in the morning, get the kids to school and go to work. But all I can do at the moment is lay here like a zombie. I am both feeling everything and nothing.\n\nPlease, someone help.\n\n\n\n\n\n**Edit**. So, it is Monday evening. I had to have the day off work as my anxiety was going absolutely crazy and when that happens my body dumps and shuts down. \n\nHe came home from work and started complaining a bit that I had not gone in. I cut that off straight away and told him that he had no right to expect anything from me in this situation, that he had broken my heart, my trust and basically my mind.\n\nHe came up stairs to me a while later and told me the he was really upset with himself for hurting me so badly, that he still didn't know what he wanted etc. I told him that I had spoken to my mum and she had helped me to start taking things one at a time, eg, drink some water, eat an apple, phine my Dr and psych. I hadn't eaten in 36 hours so that helped.\n\nI have made a couples appt with my psych for next week. If he wont go, she will see me alone. I have also told a close friend out here what is happening in case I feel I need to get out to talk to someone else.\n\nI have managed to go shopping tonight, I needed to practice getting out the house as I want to go to work tomorrow for some sense of normality in my day.\n\nWe both cried a lot ths afternoon, he said he wishes that he had never said anything because of the hurt it has caused. He wanted to just pretend it had ever happened. I told him I wished that I could too, but that he has taken 14 years of love and trust and trampled all over it.\n\nEven if he tells me he loves me once more, am I ever going to be able to believe him?\n\n**Edit** **2** So, it is Wednesday evening now, and also my birthday (yeah, he threw this at me three days before my b'day!) Things are ok here, lots of talking and communicating. He made a real effort today to ask what I wanted to do, and seems to be ok with me not wanting to do much other than have dinner and cake at home with him and the kids. \n\nWork are being very supportive, especially today, they were very sweet and keep checking in on me! \n\nHusband bought me a birthday card that he says he took a long time to choose to get the wording right. If I had recieved it last year, I would have cried with delight at what it said about our feelings and relationship. This year I read it over and over, trying to decide if he had just chosen one at random, whether he meant what it said, whether it represented what he really feels. I just can't shake that lack of trust now and it upsets me that this is happening. I want to be able to be completely happy again, but I go through the day and suddenly that conversation comes up in y mind again and all the horrible feelings and negativity come back.\n\nOh well, counselling in one week today. We shall see what happens next I guess.",

Even if I *know* that I did something right, my mind is still consumed with ugly thoughts that I didn't do it right or that I forgot something. Literally anything can trigger it. When I have these obsessive episodes, I just want to cry because I feel like I can't force myself to stop obsessing. I'm so afraid of getting in trouble because I didn't do something right or I didn't realize I did something wrong. So I'm constantly checking and re-checking. I have to replay scenarios in my head to make sure that I did a certain action the way that I thought I did. I feel so isolated because I internalize these emotions. My boyfriend has bipolar and mild anxiety, but he's very expressive about it. I feel like when I talk about it, I'm not taken as seriously because it's not a common topic for me (internalization of emotions). I know there are a lot of people out there who have similar obsessive and anxiety driven tendencies as I do, but fuck does it feel overwhelmingly lonely. /rant",

I know objectively that it is almost certainly caused by anxiety, but I'm a worrier and can't help but think that something is wrong with my heart.

            "selftext": "So I have had anxiety off and on for about three years.  It started after a nightmare - I woke up and had a huge panic attack.  For some reason, it has focused on my fear of going crazy, ending up in an insane asylum.\n\nFirst it fixated on the \"what if I lose my mind and start becoming extremely violent?  Hurting people I know and love?  After some time, that fear lost all of it's edge and now it seems ridiculous.  My mind still occupies the fear of going crazy, so it had to find something else to fixate on.  There was a picture of my wife that I had put up on my cubicle wall, and I developed a fear that I felt like she was \"looking at me\".  In my head, that was something a crazy person would think, right?  So that became my new powerful fear.  Now that has transitioned as well, to a new fear that I am almost too embarrassed to say because well, it's almost a bit comical.  Scratch that. It's hilarious, and yet here it is coming up every time I have anxiety..\n\nSo you know how you can see your nose in your vision but you always subconsciously see past it?  Well believe it or not my fear fixated on the idea that...what if I went crazy and couldn't stand my own nose?  What if it meant I lost it and had whack it off?\n\nSo now when I get flare ups, I am immediately aware of my nose in my vision.  Lol.  Can anyone outdo the strangeness of this fear?\n\nBtw, I have recently come off Paxil which helped immensely, so I think I might resume it since things are flaring up again.",

I feel like I have to answer this question otherwise it'll drive me insane. But then I try to think about how I felt before I asked the question. I was fine before and all it is is a thought. I can answer the question in a few ways. I could say, \"well I don't know if everything is real, what is real? Just what I perceive. Nothing to get worked up about and move on.\" I feel like moving on is an important part. Don't think about it. When you calm down you can think a little more rationally about it.
