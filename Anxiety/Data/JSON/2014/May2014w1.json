Then tonight at 1am I went to a little Walmart with my SO. \n\nPart of me is excited because I never in a million years thought I'd ever drive on an actual road, and another part of me is just.........disappointed that I wasted all these years. I'll be 30 in 5 years and I'm just now learning how to do things that normal people learn at 16. I feel very pathetic and immature. I know I need to think positive though.\n\nOh and the actual driving was nerve-racking, I wouldn't have been able to do it without my SO telling me exactly what to do, but he said I did perfect, so that's good news.",

Thanks for the comments they made me feel better. Not as nervous as I initially was I think adrenaline is starting to kick in. I'll report back when I get home.\n\nedit 3: I was fine once I got there thanks for all of the comments!

            "selftext": "And as I'm writing this all out the anxiety in my brain immediately jumps to \"you're jinxing yourself by writing this out!\"... but fuck you brain, I'm going to enjoy my moment!\n\nFirst - I just started on week six of zoloft and I'm finding myself actually feeling better.  In little ways it seems - I need less xanax, I find myself reading again and enjoying it, I'm not dreading the night and going to bed (previously nighttime laying in bed meant panic attack time), I find myself now and then being more mindful - enjoying the view, feeling the breeze on my face, little things I didn't even know I was missing.  I'm more talkative, more relaxed, more confident.  Even with sex - which has always been an anxiety inducing experience for me - I'm more relaxed and more in the moment.  More able to goof around in bed and just enjoy it even if we both just end up giggling - I'm not as self aware.\n\nBut also I started working at a convienence store.  I used to work in a grocery store back in high school - back before my most recent and most worst bit of anxiety.  I was to the point where I was becoming agoraphobic, extreme anxiety, etc.  I was worried that today - being my first day on the register - would end badly.  But... I just relaxed into it.  I felt like I was right back in high school again - each customer I interacted with only for a few moments so I didn't have time to worry about what they thought about me, what I was saying, etc, etc.  I just... let go.  And it felt amazing.\n\nSo maybe I am jinxing myself by writing this all down and maybe the universe does have it out for me - but right now in this moment I feel pretty good.  And if I can go from where I was (3-4 *intense* panic attacks a day for months, xanax, trapped in the house, etc, etc)... I have faith that you all will get there too. ",

            "selftext": "Totally random, last night I was procrastinating my senior paper (love getting to anxious to work), and I started thinking about being on the west coast after graduation.  I never made many friends here (east coast school) and the thought moving out to a city after living in the woods for so long has been a bit overwhelming for me.  Near the end of May I will be driving across country to California: a city I know from flying through it, a place where I know 2 other people that i trust, looking for a job I doubt i can get.  \nSo, while putting off my ~25 page paper due in 11 hours (still don't have a solid topic), I recieved an email from Match.com and started making a free profile.  Two hours later I had completed pretty much everything for it and had started browsing through matches to see people i might be able to start relationships with when i get out there.  \nMy anxiety stems from a mix between social phobia (actual diagnosis) and generalized anxiety disorder, and it has prevented me from participating in most forms of social media for the last 4 years (all my college years nonetheless).  I couldn't do facebook, or twitter, or even something as simple as snapchat. I couldn't even make a linkedin profile for professional reasons. \nThis morning when i woke up i was kind of amazed, i realized that i had skipped over all of the social media crap and made an honest profile, pictures and everything, that exposed what feels like the deeper parts of my being.  Even though i was amazed, it put me on edge. But as the day went on i started getting notifications (even though its probably a marketing ploy) from members that checked out my profile, that sent me emails, even that \"liked\" my photos, and it actually started to calm me, even make me smile a bit.  \nI know this has no effect on your life whatsoever, but maybe there is one of you that will read it and just give something similar a try, and benefit from it like i have (so far).  My only regret is having spent my money on video games so that i cant afford any reasonable subscription haha.  \n\ntl;dr I made a Match.com profile even though i have not participated in any social media type things since 2010, and it has actually made me feel a lot better (so far).

I dread talking about my anxiety and panic. And I feel like a total fraud and loser claiming thirty years of sobriety when I have so little peace in my life.\n\nI am doing things I never did before.

            "selftext": "May 21st marks the 10th anniversary of my dad's passing; he died of a rather violent heart attack in front of me when I was thirteen. I've come to expect the infestation of anxiety and existential dread--something I'm prone to anyway--that seeps in around May 1st, but for some reason this year it's especially brutal.  To be blunt, I have this horrible \"premonition\" that I'm going to die on or around his death date (Jesus, that was hard to type out--putting thoughts into text really has a way of confirming their lunacy, no?), and as much as I try to rationalize it, my stupid brain keeps trying to find ways to justify it.  For instance, I've found myself laying in bed in the morning reading about other people's apparent knowing of their impending demise on more numerous occasions than I'm willing to admit, and if I let myself, I even get into all this bizzaro magical thinking shit about numbers (e.g. I've always really liked the number 10, and 7x3=21, two numbers which also add up to 10, etc etc). I am fully aware that this is irrational, but I can't shake it.  My therapist says I'm feeling residual guilt about dad, but if anything I'm really just pissed off at him for being dead (another issue entirely).\n\nAnyway, my motive for posting here was to see if anyone else has had to deal with this or something similar, or if they have any advice on how to handle it.  Any thoughts would be wholeheartedly appreciated. ",

            "selftext": "I wrote this today (it will become obvious why I ended up writing if you read it, heh). I've had treatment for anxiety and although it's still a part of my life and something I encounter on a daily basis, it's now something I can deal with. Maybe this will reassure you that you'll deal with it too one day :)\n\nI have generalised anxiety disorder (or GAD), which basically means I am capable of worrying a disproportionate amount over almost nothing. Or, worryingly often, actually nothing. I\u2019ve come a long way in dealing with it which is something I am really proud of. The thing is, this doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s gone away or suddenly become easy; dealing with it is hard work, it took a lot of learning to do and of course, isn\u2019t completely failsafe.\n\nMy anxiety usually takes the form of \u201cchecking\u201d. At the most basic level, I\u2019ll latch onto something inconsequential, usually relating to my interactions with another person. Maybe I only spoke to my boyfriend very briefly before we both left in the morning or I snapped at someone I didn\u2019t want to upset. Then I feel like I have to think over everything that happened to make sure nothing \u201cwent wrong\u201d. When this gets bad, it spills over to most or all interactions with other people. I end up desperately trying to remember every line of a conversation so I can check it. This sort of ruins all interactions with other people. That friendly conversation with the bloke in the post office? Better obsess over it until I\u2019ve forgotten that it was cheerful and can only be stressed over not knowing exactly how he replied to me over one little thing. And it\u2019s even worse for interactions with my nearest and dearest.\n\nWhen things are super bad, the checking affects everything. I sit there and it\u2019s like a voice in my head says \u201cIs anything going wrong?\u201d once every minute. Simple tasks like going into town or talking to acquaintances become really upsetting. Tears happen. Although I don\u2019t actually hear a voice in my head, it feels like my brain is split into two parts: one logical one which looks out and tells me there really isn\u2019t anything to worry about, and a really noisy panicking part which is screaming \u201cWHAT IF THERE IS SOMETHING GOING WRONG? WHAT IF YOU JUST NEED TO THINK ABOUT IT MORE BEFORE YOU CAN IDENTIFY THE PROBLEM AND SOLVE IT? HMM? WHAT COULD BE WRONG?\u201d\n\nThe shouting panicky voice gets sort of hard to ignore. I swear it actually gets louder if I\u2019m trying to focus on work or even trying to relax.\n\nLuckily I have had a lot of help with GAD. I\u2019m pretty sure it\u2019s been with me all my life but I finally decided to go to the doctor\u2019s once I couldn\u2019t get through a day without breaking down in tears and panicking about something. (To anyone reading this: you really don\u2019t need to wait this long. Especially in the UK where we have the NHS, go tell your doctor if you think you worry even a bit too much. See what they can do for you.) Because I\u2019d had other similar doctor\u2019s visits before (I also have a big problem with trichotillomania or compulsive pulling out of my hair and had a lot of OCD traits in my childhood) they gave me antidepressants to get me started. Yes, I did have to think very carefully about taking them. Yes, they did make me super ill for the first month. I was dizzy, my sleep cycle went out of the window, I lost a stone, I got a stomach upset. But in the end the side-affects went away and I am pretty sure the pills have helped. I tried to look at it like this: I take hay fever pills every day or I\u2019d sneeze too much to function. I take the contraceptive pill every day or I\u2019d be too pregnant to function. And now (just for a bit \u2013 the doctor and I both agreed I would come off them at a time when I had less external stress in my life, because this was during my final year of university and a lot of family problems) I take antidepressants, or I\u2019d be too worried to function.\n\nThe thing is, you don\u2019t just want to rely on a pill and by itself it won\u2019t fix the problem anyway. I also started Cognitive Behavioural Therapy with the university\u2019s counselling service. (Hello again, reader. Do you have a problem at uni? Go and see your counselling service. They\u2019re free and almost certainly helpful and useful. You will only be able to use them while you\u2019re at uni so grab that resource while you can. Their waiting list here was much shorter than the NHS too.) This then lead to a group therapy session. \n\nCBT takes a lot of work because it just gives you techniques to help yourself. We were given so many \u2013 gradually, over weeks, so we could try them out. My goal was to spend an entire Sunday relaxing without getting into a cycle of checking and spiralling out of control until I was all upset. For me, the techniques that work best are:\n\n\u2022\tWeighing up the evidence. You take the worry and make it into a statement. \u201cI should be doing more work towards my exams.\u201d (There are usually \u201cdistorted\u201d words in these statements; \u201cshould\u201d is the example here, because it suggests there is some perfect moral course of action I\u2019m obliged to take. So you point out to yourself that that\u2019s not the case and you needn\u2019t use such language.) Then you weigh up the evidence. Should I? Well, it\u2019s a month until finals, so I do need to work hard. But I am already doing a good 6 hours a day 6 days a week. I reckon I don\u2019t need to be doing more at this point.\n\n\u2022\tDelaying the anxiety. I can sit there in the library unable to work because I need to \u201csolve\u201d something I\u2019m worried about. \u201cSomething is going wrong!!!\u201d the panicky part of my brain is shouting and it won\u2019t leave me alone until I actually FIND something for it to obsess over, and then we\u2019ll be obsessing so we\u2019ll be no better off. I write myself a sticky note that I will deal with the problem at 6.30. Two things happen then: my mind can shut up, because it hasn\u2019t got to cling to that worry, to remembering that we need to check, to checking. We\u2019re okay because we\u2019re going to do it at six thirty and if we forget, well, we won\u2019t because of the sticky note! Secondly, when it gets to 6.30, I usually feel fine. But the lady who ran our CBT group said it\u2019s still important to deal with the anxiety or you\u2019ll lose faith in this technique, so I weigh up the evidence or, like now, end up writing a two page word document.\n\nWriting was actually a technique I employed a lot before the class but in a much less positive fashion. I\u2019d feel better for a bit because my worry was on paper and not in my head but then it would return and I\u2019d have to make sure my paper version exactly matched the version in my head\u2026 that it perfectly explained why I was worried\u2026 and it escalated again. The lady who ran my group called this a \u201csafety behaviour\u201d \u2013 something you do to relieve anxiety in the short term but which actually undermines your long term ability to deal with it. My main safety behaviour was (and still is \u2013 I still have to be mindful of this and avoid doing it) reassurance seeking. I\u2019m worried? Better call my mum or my boyfriend and check with them that nothing is wrong really. The thing is, coming to rely on other people isn\u2019t very useful. They\u2019re not always available (although they make themselves available which is a damn amazing thing to do but not their purpose in life!) and I need to be able to cope, at least to a degree, alone. Otherwise things will escalate and I will have a massive phone bill. So we used hierarchies of small changes to try and overcome our safety behaviours. (I only semi used this technique because I found myself using my safety behaviours so much less anyway as I overcame the anxiety. However, I still think it\u2019s incredibly important to be mindful of them.) Other safety behaviours that I used not so much were obsessive writing, eating and procrastinating.\n\nThis morning I was very anxious \u2013 I\u2019d found some little statements to worry about and the big empty space where I move away from my boyfriend after exams was weighing down on me. So I said look, deal with this later and do some work in the meantime. I promised myself that I\u2019d write down the fears I had this morning once the evening came. Although I have a bit more perspective and they\u2019re not so scary now, here goes. (Remember to use the evidence technique, you have to turn them into statements \u2013 so \u201cIs this wrong?\u201d becomes \u201cThis is wrong.\u201d)\n\n\"What if after exams we don\u2019t make enough plans to meet up and I get mardy when I shouldn\u2019t and I just worry about not seeing each other when it really is fine and we can cope? What if I end up being daft about who organises meeting up and get all butthurt if it\u2019s mostly me? What did Tom mean last night? What if everyone thinks I go on about my anxiety too much and it\u2019s too much of a burden on them, like my mum\u2019s depression was on me when I was 15?\"\n\nOkay, maybe my perspective has gone a little too far \u2013 I didn\u2019t use the word butthurt when I was panicking, the problems seemed real and insurmountable. But now I can quite clearly see that a lot of them are irrational or, whilst still possible areas for concern, much smaller than I thought they were. Another part of the class focussed on sitting with uncertainty; some of these things are uncertain, like what will happen in the future, but this is natural and you simply have to learn to accept it and sit with it.\n\nAlso, my worries do seem to revolve around my close relationships, which makes me want to stress that I have very positive relationships with my boyfriend and family, not ones that need worrying about at all. I think there must be some underlying reason my worries dwell on these things (my CBT lady suggested this) like fear of losing them \u2013 not that I\u2019ve delved deeply into this but maybe it arises from my parents breaking up in such a drawn out way through my childhood. The CBT lady told me that addressing your behaviours and worries can actually help break down underlying assumptions (for example: \u201cSomething will go wrong in my personal relationships\u201d), which I scoffed at initially but now strongly believe. So just in case somebody I love reads this: I do love you, the logical part of my brain knows we\u2019re fine, but the screamy part is just so scared of losing you it\u2019s going to shout MAKE SURE YOU DON\u2019T SCREW THAT UP! GOOD GOD! BE CAREFUL! CHECK NOTHING IS WRONG! whenever I let it.\n\nWriting this has been pretty therapeutic and reassured me that I can and will be okay. Right now my finals are approaching and even though my anxiety attacks don\u2019t always seem to be related to them, the underlying level of stress they cause is bound to be a part of them. My lovely doctor even said this would happen and that I mustn\u2019t worry because even healthy people have problems with worry at this time! And my CBT lady would tell me to be my own \u201ccompassionate coach\u201d. I am grateful for all of these people and my boyfriend and my family who do look after me. I try to remember it is not their purpose or responsibility but at the same time their care is something they freely give (aren\u2019t they genuinely amazing). And I can cope and I will cope.\n",

My girlfriend and I have been dating for about 5 years now, and this has been happening for about the past 2 years. \n\nWhen we go out, it's always fun and enjoyable, but whenever she tells me she's out with her friends, or I see on Facebook she's doing something with her friends, I suddenly become very anxious which leads to me being depressed. \n\nI hate when this happens, I thought it would help if I went to some of the places with her, but it didn't change much. I love her to death, and am totally fine with her going out with her friends, I think she needs to be around other girls and not just me all the time. But I hate getting anxious when I find out she's with them...don't mean to sound obsessive or controlling.\n\nWould appreciate tips, stories, experiences, etc. \n\nThanks",

My mind becomes completely blank out. I can think, but it's like random thoughts and really unorganized. I'm writing like this because it would take too much effort to organize it all.\n-The stuff I want to do, I don't have any motivation to do it, and everything is starting to seem pointless\n-I can't think of anything to say when I'm alking to people. I use to have things to say but to nervous to say it, but now I,m just blank. Sometimes when people ask me something it takes me alot of effort to think of response.\n-It's hard for me to feel any positive emotions\n-I'm not a very interesting person to begin with, and don't really have any real hobbies\n-I also not getting more than 3-5 hours of sleep\n\n-Sometimes I just stare off into space and sometimes I'd accidently stare at people or they would stare at me like something is wrong with me. I try to look away because its awkward and distracting, but when I do they seem really mad. Or when they look at me expecting something. I think people are starting to hate me because of this.\n- some people have always been staring at me. I think it's because they pity me or thinking \"what's wrong with this kid\"\n- I am also getting extremely paranoid. I keep thinking that I might accidently stare at someone, or that they'll stare at me \n-I can't go on the bus or go to school without worrying that I will stare at by someone or I will get stared at. When this happens I try to look away but I can still see them through my peripherals and they would notice me.\n- I also walk strangely, and keep thinking that people are trying to avoid me, and that I might accidently stare at them  or get stared at\n- My school has social workers but I'm very hesitant to ask\n \nPlease give me any advice you have \n",
