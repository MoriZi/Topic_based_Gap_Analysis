I have always suffered from uncontrollable bowel movements during anxiety or nervousness and today was one of the worst cases ever.\n\nI managed to walk up to the college, still panicking, but felt there was no way I could even step foot in a class so instead went to the nurse rather than class to explain my situation and that I couldn't live like this anymore.

The one thing I don't like dealing with is exhaustion. \n\nLast year I experienced long exhaustion after obsessive worry following a panic attack. Some days I'd be so drained. The same thing happened a year before, but I was a drinker then, so I attributed it to just drinking a lot. \n\nThis year I felt great until I starting obsessively worrying again after getting strep throat (in June). The exhaustion started to return, but I'm also beginning to realize my stress more often. I'm in my last semester in college, living from check to check...sometimes no checks...handling an editor position at a newspaper, etc. I don't have a normal sleep schedule, really, I use a computer all of the time, and feel like sometimes I can't clear my head. Then I'll just crash...I'll feel like pure shit. Physically, more than mentally. The only time I feel really good is when I go to exercise, or if I'm with my g/f, who kind of just eases my mind. \n\nI'm beginning to accept, now that I've dealt with this for three years, that these problems are stress related. I have been told how to manage, and have proactively begun to see a counselor again. \n\nAnyone else get tired easily from being stressed? Any good solutions? \n\n\n",

            "selftext": "I started a job about a month ago, which was huge for me. It's obviously pretty normal to be nervous when you start a job, but coupled with my anxiety, I was pretty miserable. Still, after a month, every single day before I go into work, I get terrible nausea to the point where I feel like I'm going to vomit. Every. Day. Logically, I know that I'm fine, and the nausea wears off after 20ish minutes. \n\n\nWell yesterday was a really bad day. I've been super fragile for the past week or so and I was really feeling it yesterday. I cried before I left for work and I cried on the way to work. I got there, it was fine, whatever. About an hour in I got a customer who was very unhappy and I called my manager and he dealt with it for me, but he could tell that I was still really uncomfortable and not okay, I just told him I was tired and would be fine. Then I had a customer who needed a tax exempt. I'd only done one before so I was still a little shaky on it. I put the form in too soon, so that receipt printed on the form, not on the receipt paper. I called for help, and one of the other managers came and \"helped.\" By this time, the nicer male manager had left for the day. This female manager has always been a little rude/cold to me but I was used to it so I figured take a deep breath and get over it. While all the managers were fixing the receipt for her down at the other end, the lady whose thing I screwed up asked if I was new or training, so I said yes. Because I am new and still very uncomfortable. She responded with \"well they're not very helpful. they should be helping you, not leaving you over here all alone.\" And I just burst into tears. She felt awful, saying\" \"No! Honey, don't cry,\" which of course made me cry harder. Long story short I got to go on my break early so I could get myself together, but I was still very much not okay.  \n\nThe not-so-nice managers were a little more considerate the rest of the day, but now I'm terrified I'm not going to be able to hold it together at all. It doesn't help that I'm going to be working the longest shift I've had so far today. I woke up this morning and felt the nausea immediately. \n\nI don't really know what to do here. I want to quit, with all of my heart I just don't want to have this job, but it's at a craft store and I live for making things. I can't afford counseling and I'm hoping that once I get a steady income I can go to the doctor and get some medicine or something. It's just terrible. It's bad for my health, mentally and physically(I have the body of an 80 year old woman), but I need money. It's not even 30 hours a week, it's barely 20 hours a week. And I've been wanting to talk to my boss, but this week is inventory and something called \"fall tour\" which is where higher-ups from the company come and \"examine\" our store, so now isn't really a time to ask for anything. \n\nAnd this is just one bad circumstance. I swear there's at least one thing I do every day that I can tell pisses someone off, or makes them think I'm stupid and useless, which just makes me feel stupid and useless. I don't want to come home on the brink of tears every night, and I don't want to have to wake up with nausea every morning.\n\ntl;dr: every day before work I get terribly nauseous. Yesterday I had an emotional breakdown at my register and am now worried I won't be able to hold myself together at all. I want to quit, but I need the money.\n\n\nedit: spelling",

I forget things constantly, it's hard to process what the teachers are saying and I always have to ask help from people. I end up mostly not doing it because I did it so much that I pretty much think that they are just annoyed by it. I feel like I have to sort it out myself.\n\nI just hope it's not that early-20s phase of confusion and worry that is always parodied in the movies. I don't want to become a laughing stock.\n\nThe worst thing is that I do t even have severe anxiety, at least not anymore. I rarely have panick attacks and I can be quite cheerful at times. But I still feel this shame and fear. I even end up thinking that I don't even have anxiety issues and that I'm just probably dumb.\n\nEven now I stress over the fact that people reading this will think that because of my limited English writing skills (its not my first language but still...), I must be stupid or hopeless. I really hope its not the case.",

I would say that even at moments where as a whole I feel \"fine\" and happy, I always have one health issue that I'm constantly worried about. I'm never content with my health, theres always that one thing that bugs me in the back of my mind. \n\nI get to the point where I feel I can't enjoy good things because whats the point if I'm just going to die from one of these diseases. If something good happens, it makes me feel more sad for this reason. For some reason, I've never felt like I will live for ages and die of old age, I always feel like I will die young and upset my family. This leads me on to my next point which is that when I think about getting these diseases, I don't consider how I would feel just what my mum or dad would say. I picture them crying because their young child was unlucky.\n\nI actually feel really stupid for writing this because people have actual problems and my issues are all worrying about something that hasn't even happened.
