            "selftext": "Possible Trigger Warning (!)\n\nThere is this giant fancy mall near the university campus. I frequent that place a lot, mostly the convenience store. I ordered food before, I ate at the university dinning hall countless times. It's just feels different, looks different, I don't know how to describe it to you. My agoraphobia and social anxiety, inferiority complex(?) deny me the opportunity to visit such kind of places always making me feel incredibly uneasy.\n\nSo today I had some positive reinforcement in class ( :) ) and decided to treat myself to some Western style food at the food court. I decided to tame my anxiety even if it's only temporary. There were so many vendors. I looked around, picked one that would be the most easy to approach (the menu was printed on the counter). That would be easier for me because you don't actually have to talk to place your order (I stutter), you just point at the item, and that's pretty much it. So long story short, I take the order, occupy the only vacant table... in the the middle of the court, sweating through my shirt (at this point). I took a sip of soda, calmed myself down a little bit and prepared myself for the delicious treat that is the hamburger. So that's it, guys. One tiny step to a better life.\n\nThank you for reading this recital. Sorry I took your time. Take care. Over and out.",

            "selftext": "I have been an avid coffee drinker for at least ten years (also diet soda). Due to my growing dependence/reliance on it and inability to function without it, I knew I had to quit all forms of caffeine. The caffeine withdrawal was extremely physically taxing--I experienced monstrous headaches and unbelievable levels of lethargy/fatigue. However, once it was over (5 days after I decided to quit), I experienced this new refreshed feeling I hadn't felt since I was a child. I noticed I developed a new mental clarity/acuteness and a palpable decline in my anxiety levels. I also am able to sleep much better and have no problems falling asleep as I did before (I am an insomniac). I highly recommend quitting all forms of caffeine (soda, coffee, whatever) if you want to reduce anxiety. Coffee definitely exacerbates or possibly even causes panic attacks, anxiety, and insomnia.",

And its not just the \"oh I'm sad because its over\" but like...For my entire life I've used these things as coping mechanisms, and now I can't bear for them to conclude? It took me two plus weeks to watch the last two episodes of BSG. There's upwards of ten shows I've never finished. Tens of books. I never read the last handful of pages or the last episode. \n\nIts to the point where I don't really watch movies/tv shows or read books anymore. I've only seen four or five new movies in the last three or four years. I only really watch shows that I had seen previously a bunch of times. \n\nIts hard to explain. I learned one of my other friends kinda feels the same, but I don't see them much so I don't have a way to talk about it with them. \n\nBut its just a part of my anxiety issues, and it gets so bad. It translates into other places in my life, too, like going places or being with friends. Do other people relate to this at all? Is this a thing; not being able to end things or start new things for the fear of it ending?\n\nIt seems so silly and ridiculous because its just like...a TV show or a movie but its upsetting because like I said, these things are coping mechanisms and I love them so much.

            "selftext": "I have discovered that a lot of the \"lump in throat\" feeling I had been experiencing is due to tension in the Trapezius muscle and other neck muscles which wrap around from back-of-head across the throat. If the shoulders are too tense and raised up, that puts more pressure around the neck and the throat. So by forcing myself to push my shoulders straight down (as far as possible) I find this prevents the \"lump in throat\" almost completely and I recommend everyone try it.\n\nSpecifics: Standing straight, with arms relaxed at your sides, imagine you are holding heavy weights in each hand. Relax your shoulders as much as possible. Next, using your upper-back muscles, actually pull the shoulders straight down as far as they will go, as if you were holding even more weight. You should feel the trapezius-superior on the sides of your neck stretching sideways. \n\nNote: I am not a doctor or anything, make sure you are physically okay to do simple stretches before attempting.",

            "selftext": "My sister \"Mary\" has had anxiety problems most of her adult life.  For a little background on her, she has had trouble transitioning into adulthood.  She went to community college for about 6 years, trying to finish an AA degree.  Her progress was slowed by many dropped classes and failed quarters.  She recently has been doing much better in a lot of ways - she is enrolled in an online program to get a 4-year degree, she is working a part-time job, and she started seeing a psychiatrist for the first time ever.\n\nI cannot stress how proud I am of her, or how important and special she is to me.  However, I can't help but feel that her attitude towards her anxiety is creating a lot of interpersonal problems for her.  She acts like a victim.\n\nMary and I share the same group of friends and, obviously, the same family.  I feel like she uses her anxiety as an excuse to treat her family and friends poorly sometimes, or expects other people to tailor their behavior so as to not upset her.  She can be very abrasive to our friends when she doesn't like the way they are acting.  For instance, our group plays tabletop RPGs together.  She can be very hostile towards other players if they take actions she does not agree with.  I think the other players take it as her being a bitch, but I know her well enough to tell that she feels justified in believing that others should modify their behavior to make her feel more comfortable.\n\nShe will also outright bring up her anxiety when she wants other people to change the way they are acting.  For instance, I was visiting home the other day (my sister lives with our parents) and my dad and I were having a debate - not even a real argument, just a spirited back-and-forth discussion.  She felt uncomfortable (she has never liked our debates) so she sulkily said \"You guys are really testing my anxiety medication right now.\"  I feel like she expects the rest of the world to change to accommodate her mental health issues.\n\nI really do sympathize with her.  I have bipolar type II and I know living with mental illness is no picnic.  However, I can't help but feel she is dooming herself to a miserable life by acting like a victim.  She expects the world to change to make her life easier - I just don't think she is being realistic.  As sufferers of mental illnesses, we have to fight harder than everyone else to live a normal life, and yes, it is a struggle, but I believe it is our responsibility to overcome our issues, not everyone else's.\n\nAm I being too hard on her?  Do I just not understand what it's like to live with anxiety?  I want to help her stop being a victim, but I don't know if she wants my help or even believes there is anything wrong with her behavior.  If I am being totally unreasonable, feel free to let me know.  I won't lie, my motives are somewhat selfish.  Her behavior does annoy me.  But I also want her to live a happy life.  I don't know if she can achieve that with her current mindset.\n\n**tl;dr: My sister uses her anxiety problem as an excuse to act like a victim.  Am I unreasonable/insensitive for being bothered by this?  How can I approach her about this?  Can/should I help her?** ",

I regret what I did 100%. \nive been suffering from depression and anxiety my entire life and its gotten much worse over the past few months. I have a group of work friends Ive talked to and for the most part they have been supportive. A few days ago one of them told me that she didnt want to be friends anymore. She said she \"Didnt wanna keep trying to make me happy\". I agree that i havent been the easiest person to be around lately. Anyway, since then Ive been paranoid that shes been badmouthing me to everyone else at work. Ive been filled with this paranoia and yesterday I let it get the best of me. I checked her phone.....I know, fucking stupid and everything. What I saw horrified me. She and a few of the co-workers I had told were actually making fun of my illness via text conversation. Doing things like showing each other pictures of my conversations at my lowest point and saying that i was just trying to make them feel guilty and all that. I dont know the extent of who has been talking about my but now I just feel lost, like I dont have anyone at work anymore. I have no idea what these people are telling my co-workers....\nHas anything like this ever happed with a group of friends? what did you do?\n\n\nTL;DR I checked my friends phone and saw a group of my friends were making fun of my illness",

So instead of celebrating with my friends I was alone away from the party and convulsing, desperately struggling for breath. It took me ages to look for professional help, and in the time in between my life pretty much fell apart because I felt like I was definitely about to die at least once a day. \n\nWhen I did get help I found breathing retraining exercises to be a great tool to manage attacks, but hard to stick to! I love games so I designed one called Flowy that is controlled by your breathing and helps you to do them whenever you need. It\u2019s not designed to cure your anxiety (and it won\u2019t!) but it\u2019s a tool to help you manage your symptoms - hopefully while you find professional care!  \n\nWith the help of some great people who know way more than me about research and psychology I ran a randomised controlled trial testing the app - it was small but found some really promising results! Now together we really want to test it with as many people as possible so we\u2019re asking for your help!\n\nIf a game existed to help combat symptoms of panic attacks, what features would you like it to have? Would you be interested in testing the [app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.playlab.flowyfree&amp;hl=en_GB) ? Have you had a similar experience? All feedback appreciated :)\n\nEDIT: During calibration, please make sure to release your finger just after your deep breath, and **before** holding your breath and exhaling; this should hopefully allow you to play the game without any issues. Thanks steinman17 for the feedback!\n\n\n ",

Mind wouldn't stop racing, thoughts would terrorize me, my body would be all fight-or-flight. Paranoia, stress, stomach butterflies, dreading things, what not.   Thankfully I don't get them anymore, the ONLY thing absent in my life is tea (also coffee). \n\nI don't know about you, but I never knew how badly tea used to trigger anxiety in me until I quit it. It took me a few weeks probably to completely quit it as I used to drink at least two cups every day. Now, even when I have a cup of tea, there is an immediate, noticeable spike in anxiety that I can feel. The good thing is, now I know that the anxiety is not my own but an effect of the tea. Still, I try to avoid it more or less (unless I am having a cold, where a bit of tea works well for unclogging the sinus). I would tell you this, try to slowly go off the wagon of tea and coffee (I quit coffee as well, but let me assure you, it takes time to quit these things, a couple of months is nothing here because how deeply we are used to drinking the coffee and tea). Getting rid of tea got rid of 90% of my anxiety. Of course dealing with the situations which gave me anxiety, coping with them in a better way also helped, but tea was a major player in the \"triggering\" phase of anxiety. Without it, it takes much more stress and strain for me to get anxious. Which is good, isn't it? :)\n\nHope this post helps you, best wishes for a better time. ",

            "selftext": "This is a discussion I would like peoples opinion on. More and more lately, i'm waking up to the fact that the internet has completely screwed me up in terms of all the anxieties and worries I feel. \n\nMaybe I was pre-disposed to be a person who worries about their health but there is no doubt in my mind that the internet has made it 1000x as bad. For example, recently I've contracted a chest infection after a cold. I done a bit of googling and seen something called myocarditis which can cause sudden death. I read about it for a few hours and have completely freaked myself out for the last 5 days and been in a constant state of panic. Thinking I'll die at any second. I'm not sure any of you have had the fear of sudden death before but it's very scary.\n\nWithout the internet I wouldn't even know such a condition exists. Without the internet maybe I'd go to the doctor more frequently than I should. But my knowledge about the existence of certain conditions would be nowhere near what it is now and thus I'd worry so much less. I recognize the importance of the internet in society, but sometimes I wish it never came into existence. Life would be so much simpler. I couldn't google my every symptom. I couldn't read up on sudden death and convince myself it will happen to me. \n\nSome of you might say get rid of the internet but it's not that simple. The internet is ubiquitous in society. Just wondering what are peoples thoughts on this? Stopping googling is something which could obviously help but any HA sufferer knows it's not that simple to stop googling stuff. Even when not looking for something about a symptom sometimes I'll read a story about a young person dying suddenly and then freak myself out. It's such a vicious circle. I appreciate any replies.",
