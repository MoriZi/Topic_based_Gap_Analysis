The problem was I only got about 5 hours of sleep.  I usually need about 8 to even feel like a normal person.  Now I'm wondering why I feel so good today and that in itself is giving me anxiety.\n\nEdit: Wow, I didn't expect so many responses. Glad that I'm not alone (although I don't wish this on anybody, so don't take that the wrong way). I guess I should say, at least the way I feel is relatively normal so that eases my mind.",

            "selftext": "This is mostly directed at hypochondriacs and people with specific fears, but I hope it helps anyone who deals with anxiety. \n\nLike many hypochondriacs on this sub, I have always been pretty scared of developing diseases. Every cough was the flu, every headache was brain cancer, every twinge was something lifethreatening. I discovered this sub and it helped immensely to see that I wasn't the only one who freaked out and ran to the doctor when something seemed up. I googled symptoms constantly, and was so scared of developing one of those inhibiting diseases that ruined my life. I didn't have anxiety- my anxiety had me. \n\nWell, now it's happened. I started having actually scary neurological symptoms (I'm not giving details because I'm NOT sending one of you running to the doctor- not the point of this post at all!!!) and got admitted to the hospital a few days ago (Another thing- trust your doctors! If they think something is up, they will keep you and test you and poke you with needles, and when they tell you you're okay, BELIEVE THEM. Unless they're worried, you shouldn't be!). \n\nLong story short, I have MS. It's a huge bummer. I'm not gonna lie, I'm scared, I cried, I beat a pillow and cried some more. But then I realized- now that it's actually happened/happening, all that anxiety was just wasted time. It didn't keep me from getting it; it may have made me slightly more aware of what was going on, but I would have gone to the hospital and gotten this diagnosis even if I didn't spend the last three years anxious as hell about actually getting it. \n\nMy message to you all is to try to relax, because the fear of getting this is almost worse than it actually happening. I know the unknown scares you, and you have EVERY right to feel what you feel. But try to get help, and understand that diseases and cancer may seem like they're happening everywhere, yet they're not! They're just loudly talked about. You are almost definitely NOT in that group! If you're scared you are, go get a checkup, go get those tests, then trust in your doctor to know that those test results are true and interpreted well. \n\nEven if, god forbid, you get something or one of your fears gets realized, guess what? Because you've dealt with this horrible monster called anxiety, YOU ARE INCREDIBLY STRONG AND YOU WILL GET THROUGH THIS. \n\n**YOU ARE AMAZING.**\n\n**YOU ARE GOING TO LIVE A GOOD, LONG LIFE.**\n\n**YOU HAVE THIS COMMUNITY TO SUPPORT YOU.**\n\nIf you haven't gotten help yet, or slacked on therapy or your meds, go get help! You are not alone! BREATHE! It's going to be okay.\n\nShare a victory this week! No matter how small, it's a victory!\n\nI'll start: I got diagnosed with MS, and I decided I am going to kick its ass. I will have MS. It will not have ME!\n\nEDIT: Whoever got me gold, you are so sweet! Please tell me who you are so I can cover you in cute cat pictures and send you a thank you card (it's the Southern thang to do!)",

I dont want to work another late night shift job unless I have to.\n\nI have few friends and could join a social group at my school, but people generally annoy me and I get exhausted pretty quickly and get headaches around people I dont know. So there goes that out the window.\n\nFinally, since I'm taking programming classes at school and learning to become a programmer, I could teach myself more advance techniques and learn new languages as I go along, but I'm such an unmotivated shit that unless it's school work, I'm too lazy to do it.\n\nThen since I'm doing almost nothing all the damn time, bad thoughts begin to repeat themselves like \"haha you aren't cut out for this field, quit while you're ahead yoh idiot\" or \"anyone can code that, now do something more advance, oh yea, that's right, you cant!\" since I'm too damn lazy to teach myself new things. Sometimes the buildup gets so bad I have to physically punch myself to calm down.(luckily rarely though)\n\nHell, to be honest few things honestly get me excited besides maybe video games, but I beat them so quickly with all this freetime that it just leads back to the problem of sitting around doing nothing.\n\nOverall, I feel like I'm going crazy doing absolutely fuck-all sitting on my bed all day long. I mean, I'd like to go out and do stuff, but asocial issues/anxiety prevent me. I feel like pretty much my every reaction will be \"no\" or \"please don't bother me\" Any advice?",

            "selftext": "For the past year I've taken 600mg of Welbutrin daily.  Two 300mg time release in the morning.\n\nMy insurance plan didn't want to pay for it at first, and we had to go back &amp; forth between the pharmacist at CVS, the doctor prescribing it, and the insurer before they'd agree to pay for it... I don't know what the exact process is, but they all figured out that I could get 32 of the 300mg pills per bottle with a normal copay.  Those 32 pills last me 16 days, and I've *always* been able to go back to CVS on day 14 to request a refill.  We've always had to go through this drill where the pharmacist says \"I'll have to check with a manager to put this through\", and then they do, and it goes through, and they give me another bottle of pills within a day or two, before the 16 day mark.\n\nA few weeks ago I went back on day 14 of the cycle to refill, and they told me the prescription ran out and the doctor needed to write a new one.... I got stressed that I wouldn't be able to get medication, but called the doctor, he immediately sent in a new script, and everything was fine....\n\nTwo days ago I went back, on day 14 of the newest cycle, to refill.... The same pharmacist as last time, who had previous told me the script ran out, was there... She told me I can't refill until a 17 day interval has passed.  I asked her if there was an issue with the new prescription and she told me no, it's fine, but she still can't refill it until 17 days.  I asked what changed?  I've always been able to do this?  She says something must have changed on my insurance plan.  I left, called my carrier, and verified that coverage had not changed at all (I'm one of their agents and service all of my own insurance policies... I knew nothing had changed when she first suggested it, but checked anyway... Nothing changed.)... Then I called the doctor, and he said the prescription was word-for-word what it was before.\n\nNow... I went back today, this morning, on day 16, and the same damn pharmacist was there.  She told me to come back tomorrow.  I told her that if I come in tomorrow, submit a request, and then wait the day or two for them to fill the script... I will have gone 48+ hours with zero medication... I have enough for today, and that's it.  I told her just let me pay for the pills myself, I don't care if it costs a ridiculous amount.  I. can. not. function. without. these.  Let me buy them.  She said she would need a new prescription for that.\n\nI didn't even respond and drove off (it was at the drive through window)....\n\nLong story short I'm at work and have had to shut my office door, block the windows, and leave my phone off the hook because even though I'm still medicated, I'm so fucking scared of what will happen tomorrow when I'm not, and can barely function right now....\n\nWhat the fuck happened?  Is this pharmacist just giving me a hard time?  Should I somehow pull myself together and speak to her supervisor, and hope that she's been doing something wrong?  What if she's right, and I really have to start taking several-day lapses in medication before they'll refill?  Do I need to juggle two prescriptions like she's saying?  I'm so flustered about this that I haven't even called the doctor back to see if he can do anything, I should, for some reason I haven't been able to, I'm stuck in a puddle of fear &amp; nerves and don't know what to do about this.... I'm already mid panic attack, talking to CVS again is causing severe anxiety, even seeing that pharmacist again is causing anxiety.... Why can't they just give me my pills like they always have?!",
