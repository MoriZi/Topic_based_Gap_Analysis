            "selftext": "It's been over a month now since I took any Xanax.  I used to get anxiety about taking it.  I used to get anxiety about everything.  The last three months of 2013 were so bad that I was starting to get heart palpitations.  I decided enough was enough and that I had to do more than see a doctor and get a script.\n\nAround Christmas I ran in to a guy who is a life coach.  Yeah, I thought it sounded silly too but he gave me some great advice.  He told me that I'm focusing too much on the future and things that I don't have.  Yeah, so?  Doesn't everyone do that?  It turns out that not everyone does.  He recommended a book to me called \"The Power of Now\".  I didn't read it right away. \n\nAnother friend of me told me to check out these videos on YouTube by a guy named Alan Watts.  Then he told me that there's a great book by Watts that would help my anxiety called \"Wisdom of Insecurity\".  So I picked up a copy.\n\nThis book was pretty heavy.  I didn't understand a lot of it but I kept reading it and enjoyed what I did understand.  It was a lot about just allowing life to happen naturally and to not obsess on what I don't have.  From here I read Power of Now by Eckhart Tolle.  By the time I was finished with this, I was in auto pilot.\n\nAuto pilot? Yes, as in I don't have to think so much about living in the moment, not obsessing about the future and saying \"what if\" about the past.  I'm here right now and that's all that matter.  The whole world is opening up to me now and I'm seeing beauty in it all.  It's an extraordinary place we live, this earth.\n\nCall me a hippie if you want but I almost feel cured of anxiety.  Maybe I am, but I tend to think that I've learned to keep it pushed to the background and forgotten about.  Yes, it could come back if I start to go back to my old ways but I know how to manage it now.  By observing that feeling of anxiety, focusing on the present moment and seeing beauty in the world, I'm so much more happy now.\n\nThank you for letting me share my story with you all.\n\n",

The other day I was having a drink with a couple of friends (drinking environments always trigger me) when I started to feel strange and everything else felt strange around me (derealization), I started to feel this heat, my hands were shaking, mind stuck, dry mouth, had to pee..the usual shit. but this time instead of grabbing a tranquilizer pill, I thought \"no more!\" found some strength inside and told my friends I was a little hot and needed fresh air. Went outside the bar, still with all the symptoms, and stood on the corner of the street alone and I felt this urge and anger and started to scream out loud \"I can't live like this anymore. I wont. I refuse to do it. I won't die now. I wont lose control. I will not let anything bad happen to me. I'm not going crazy. I'm not spending the rest of my life like this. fuck it\". By now I was screaming at the top of my lungs and crying my eyes out and this random guy shows up and asks \"are you okay? what's happening?\" and for the first time in my life I told someone what was happening \"Everything is fine. I'm fine. I'm just having a panic attack. It will be over quick, thank you\" (I never tell anyone because I think they will think I'm crazy or will not get it. Fuck this too) and then BAM all the symptoms were gone and I felt such a huge relief. I was calm again. From now I'm doing this, panic attacks and anxiety can try all they want  I will fight them, scream and kick and refuse to let it happen again. I will not give in or get in the fear spiral anymore. Enough of this shitty life I'm living. I've had it. No more.",

            "selftext": "So today my girlfriend was supposed to be starting a job. She had a severe panic attack that prevented her from turning up. I spent most of the morning with her, helping her through the panic and eventually she got through it. All of my attention during this time was directed entirely onto my girlfriend and making sure she got safely through this traumatic event. In the end I got her to get back into her pyjamas and get back into bed where she feels safe and comfortable and told her to try and go back to sleep for a while. The panic attack lasted for about an hour and a half before she went back to bed. \n\nIn the mean time, I proceeded to follow up with her work, explaining why she just didn't turn up (It was now about 40 minutes past the time she was supposed to be there). I was quite surprised with their responses, I was hit with things like \"this is the real word, you can't just not turn up without notice\" and \"you should have called us as soon as you knew she wasn't coming in\". ...Well yes, this *is* the real world and mental illness *is* a real thing. I realised that people don't seem to understand the severity of mental illness. For example, if I had called and said we were in a car accident and I was trying to manage my girlfriends injuries so I had no time to call and let them know she was not going to be turning up today I would have been greeted with a completely different response. They would have been sympathetic, concerned and completely understanding of why I hadn't contacted them immediately after the accident. So I though, is a panic attack actually *that* different from a car accident?\n\nIn a car accident you go through a traumatic event that can cause injury, if these injuries are not immediately managed they can lead to fatality. Therefore it is highly important that you manage the problem right away, you don't have the luxury of time. If the victim is bleeding out, they will eventually die of blood loss. You need to be there and make sure you manage that bleeding so it does not become fatal. If you divert your attention for even a brief period of time (like to call up and have \"the talk\", explaining why a mental illness is a legitimate thing and means you are incapable of coming in to work sometimes) there might be enough damage done to cause some severe long term effects.\n\nA car accident is quite convenient really, you can visually see the problem in front of you, and you can take the right course of action to resolve it (like applying pressure to a bleeding wound). A mental illness is quite the opposite. You have no idea how to help. Here is an example of my efforts; once she realised she was having a panic attack, I tried calming exercises (slow controlled breathing), distraction (getting our pet rabbit for some cuddles!), I tried getting her dressed and removing her from the dark bedroom and sitting out in the lounge, I tried talking though the problem, I tried minimising and rationalising the problem, I tried to create a discussion about the book she is currently reading (distraction), I tried to just cuddle her (calming), I tried to justify her panic (to reduce the conflict and disappointment in her head over not being able to go to work), I tried to tell her that she doesn't need this job and we are fine for money and I tried putting her back into her pyjamas and putting her back into the dark bedroom. A lot of these things helped, and in the end, after going through this process we did manage to get some control over the attack. \n\nSo now, think of a panic attack like a car accident. You have a traumatic event, that you need to immediately manage and it requires all of your attention. Now the tricky part, just like a car accident, a panic attack can also lead to fatality, although not in such a clear way. Untreated mental illness has a high mortality rate, but it comes in an often unforeseeable form. If you let any event, such as a panic attack, go by untreated and without sympathy or care, this event can cause severe long term effects on the victim. This one single event can sit idle in the mind of the victim for days, weeks or even years and at any time spring forth trigger an even more severe mental event. The worst case scenario is it triggers an event (like severe depression) and can lead the victim, out of sheer desperation, to the only form of relief that can finally end the suffering; Suicide. \n\nSo as you can now see, although almost invisible compared to a car accident, mental illness can be just as traumatic and devastating on the victim's life and also the people that are there to support them. When in a situation like this, your first priority is the health and well being of your partner, the same as if you were in a car accident, and secondly (once they feel like the panic and anxiety has subdued) is to provide a courtesy call to whomever will be affected as a result of the panic attack (your boss, a friend you are meeting, etc.). I think people need to realise that this is the real world, and there are things out there that they do not necessarily understand, but it is a real (potentially life threatening) issue and it has a serious impact on people's lives and (in an ideal world) should be met with a similar level compassion and concern as a car accident. \n\n\nAnnual fatalities in car accidents: 32,885\n\nAnnual fatalities from suicide: 38,364\n\n-US statistics from 2010 ",

I'm 25 now. I don't remember what it was like before my anxiety. In many ways, I feel like anxiety has robbed me of the life I was meant to have, and I feel an incredible amount of bitterness about that. There are things that I dreamed of doing (and even had the opportunity to do) that I had to turn down because of my anxiety. I have constant feelings of regret and guilt.\n\nI feel like I don't know how to be a functioning human. Everything in my brain gets filtered through my anxiety, so I can never tell if I'm making a decision because it's something I want, or because it's what's expected of me or because it will cause me less anxiety. I spend most of my life simply trying to move forward, looking at my feet, trying to keep the future at a blurry distance so I won't have to worry.\nI'm tired. I've been dealing with this for 15 years. \n\nSo this is my plea to the universe...is there anyone out there who is in my shoes? I've met people who have had anxiety, but they've all been much older than me, and in general, their anxiety started later in life. Are there those of you out there who have had anxiety since you were young? Did it get any better as time went on? Do you ever feel the things I've described?\n\nI have no one else to talk to about this, and I just want a connection to someone who understands the pain I've been dealing with for the last 15 years...anyone?",

            "selftext": "Hello Community,\n\nI used to have General Anxiety Disorder and sometimes I even had Panic attacks. Today is my 100st day without any attack. I would not say I am cured yet though, I still have some slight symptoms from time to time, but nothing compared to the attacks I used to have.\n\nI thought maybe some of you would be interested in hearing my story, therefore and cause I am somewhat proud of me finally reaching the 100 days i decided to share it.\n\nIt all started last early summer, where I started to have attacks in which I felt back pain, heart racing, a tight feeling in my throat which made me choke, or getting sick and even have to throw up sometimes. The hardest of the symptoms was the feeling of having to throw up, in some situations this was really unbearable.\n\nIt took some time I finally figured out that I was suffering from Anxiety Disorder and it took sometime until I got myself into doing a therapy. For those who are interested, I am doing a concentrative movement therapy ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concentrative_movement_therapy ) it's not so common as like CBT for example, also takes a lot more time, but seems to be a lot more in dept and more permanently. I personally really really like it and can recommend it.\n\nAnyway things actually got worse after summer, the fall was quite a hard time for me, even normal daily life became challening because of the fear of having an anxiety attack. \n\nThan 100 days ago from now I had the worst panic attack ever, it was on a trainride home to my parents, the symptoms where so hard I nearly fainted, but made it throw. Also on the same day I got very sick. I had a very bad flu and it seemed like it wont go away anymore. 1 and a half week after things got even worse, I couldn`t get up anymore, neither walk, I couldnt feel most of my body anymore, also I saw every thing with double vision. I was hospitalized, had a lot of tests done and got a lot of infusions. After 4 really horrible days the cortisone infusion finally started to effect and 1 week after the day I got into hospital, i made my first steps again. Then it was a lot of physiotherapy and getting fit again. Only very much later they finally figured out I am having Nero myelitis optica, a very rare autoimun disease, which causes inflammations in the back spine and therefore effecting the nervous system. After a bit more than a month I was finally released from the hospital, at that time I was like 90% percent recovered again.\n\nThe thing is, with the day I got into hospital, i didn`t have any anxiety attack anymore. It is hard to say what actually made them go away, or even if this two diseases are connected somewhat, but all I can say is that I never felt better than the last 2 months. (pretty much the time I got out from hospital until now, even the last couple of weeks in hospital i was doing very good already mentally)\n\nI got a lot more loose, easy and happy about the things I have. I believe it was this kind of catastrophe which made me realize things and changed my mind, but I also think the therapy (which I am still doing on a weekly base) had a lot of impact. It's really very hard to figure out what exactly did change, but I think the one of the core things is the following: \n\nI believe things that must or must not happen where one of the basic triggers of my anxiety attacks. For example if I rode on the train, I obviously didnt want to have an anxiety attack. This created such a pressure, that actually created one. So every situation, in which I thought I couldn`t afford having an attack, I would likely have one. I hope you get what you mean. All the kind of obligations I set for myself or others did, created this immense pressure and I think they created my Anxiety.\n\nAlso now I am accepting the way I am a lot more. In my bad times I always to change the way I am, wanted to be somebody else. Now I still want to grow in terms of personality, but its a different approach. I accept myself with all my flaws and want to grow from that kind of perspecitve, which is much healtier than just want to be somebody else.\n\nNow I am able to see this a lot more easy, if something bad happens, I just let it allow to happen. I dont need to force anything anymore, and this is really a release for me. Of course I still have days where I feel down or even anxious and do have some symptoms, but until now it didn`t really effect me anymore.\n\nI wish you all the best in overcoming and dealing with your disorder and for all of you who are at a very bad place right now and it doesn`t seem to end, have hope, I was at the same place as well a few months ago. \n\n",

            "selftext": "I say recovering because anxiety issues will always be a part of my life, although it is nearly non-existent. I just want to write this out here and let anyone reading this sub know my story. Hopefully it can provide some inspiration or some help.\n\nI'm my mid-30s now and live in a huge urban metropolitan area. I take public transit everywhere (that occasionally gets stuck!), been on three international trips/flights, and fly domestically 5-6x / year.\n\nIn my late teens my anxiety was so bad I couldn't leave the driveway without having a full blown, all-out crippling attack, like clockwork. I had considered suicide briefly but was too scared to do that. The very instant I woke up in the morning, I would long for it to be nighttime so I could go back to sleep so I could escape the anxiety.\n\nThe only thing I had going for me was my mother understood and would buy me a carton of smokes every 2 weeks. It was the one pleasure I had; everything else like eating, television, reading, dialing up BBS's/internet were mere aversions and was just to pass the time until it was time to go to sleep to truly escape.\n\nI started taking prozac which helped a little, but the big breaking point was when my mother threatened to have me committed if I didn't leave the house and go to a shrink. I wanted to go, but was too damn scared to get in the car. I don't know if she was serious or bluffing but I figured one way or the other I was going to leave the house and if I died outside of it, then at least I wouldn't suffer anymore.\n\nSo I got in the car.\n\nAbout 3 blocks later I was hyperventilating and every single muscle in my body had cramped up, heart racing a zillions beats per minute, and every square mm on my body was either number or had the pins and needles feeling. I remember my hands were crumpled in an odd shape, like rigor mortis had set in, I couldn't clutch anything at all.\n\nAt this time my mother made it across town but agreed to take me to the doctors office instead. I remember arriving in the parking lot, realizing where I was, and all the sudden immediately began to feel better. I gradually calmed down, and basked in the glory of stepping outside of a car and standing on the sweet, beautiful asphault in the parking lot outside of a non-descript building that contained a doctors office.\n\nIt was the most exciting thing that happened to me in three years.\n\nAfter that it was game over, I was comfortable with walking on my own and setting goals, going along for rides, and stretching my limits. Whenever I had another attack come on I would laugh it off and tell myself nothing will ever be as bad as that big one. I was able to work at a restaurant a couple blocks away and be work shifts, over the years I became more independent then moved to the big city, ~550 miles away.\n\nI still get anxious and have some setbacks at times, but one of the biggest things that I believe that helps me is diet. I consume high potassium (banana twice a day, lots of potatoes, etc). The biggest change, and maybe it was psychological, was going vegetarian and nearly vegan diet. For years, the majority of my attacks were just after eating way too much, a nice heavy meal with ton of meat, then would go walking around with a stuffed gut, then the palpatations would set in. \n\nExercise and taking showers help provide relief when I'm feeling amped up and I know I have to go somewhere soon but feeling a bit to anxious and wish I could get out of having to go somewhere. And of course a beer or two provides excellent relief.\n\nIf anyone needs a pen-pal or someone to vent to, send me a private message, I'd be happy to help out in any way I can! I know it's a cliche, but if I can get through this, anyone can.\n",
