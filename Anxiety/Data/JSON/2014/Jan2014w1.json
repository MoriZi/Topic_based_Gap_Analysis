The media has jumped on it pretty strongly.\n\nWhen you go to look at the headlines and write-ups\u2026.even from more liberal sources (which traditionally are more respectful of stuff like this) like HuffPost, they're calling it a 'meltdown' and a 'self-destruction' and all these words that just further demonize what is a very common condition.  It ticks me off they choose these words to merely drive more traffic to their sites\u2026.they don't understand the weight of what they are doing.\n\nBut here's what REALLY surprised me\u2026when you look at the comments, you see a very different story.  Normally when you read the 'Comments' section of an online story you walk away feeling helpless for humanity, but not on this.  A good percentage are pointing out what we already know, he had an anxiety attack, that's it.  Many pointed out that the guy deserved empathy and space, not ridicule, and it really stuck out to me how much of the online community echoed this thought.  People out there know and empathize with what we are going thru.\n\nI almost hope Bay would come out as a spokesman for anxiety, though I doubt he ever would.",

My whole life I have avoided social situations like parties, birthdays, and even my own college graduation. I think my anxiety stems from a fear of people judging me for my faults or not accepting me for who I really am. This is also the reason why I don't have any social media presence. I don't have a facebook or twitter because I'm afraid people will judge me for not having much of a social life or not like me for who I am. I don't have a linkedin account because I'm afraid people will judge me for having no job, despite having a degree in engineering. The worst part is that I know my anxiety is completely irrational but I still can't get over it. I'm 23 years old and I really want to come out of my shell both in real life and online. Does anyone else completely avoid social media due to their anxiety? If anyone has successfully coped with this? Please let me know. ",

            "selftext": "So I was laying around, after a whole day of doing nothing; sitting around (all day), eating junk food, and left over holiday candy.\n\nI was in a great mood, and decided to go take a nice relaxing hot shower. I shaved, messed up my beard, and had to shave the whole thing off- I've had a beard since I could grow one. I looked in the mirror, and laughed at how odd I looked, and mutter to myself \n\n\"great, now this is the day I'll die, and my viewing will be someone nobody recognizes\" \n\nAs I'm relaxing in the shower, I get a pain in my arm. a sharp very distinct pain. I rubbed my fingers over the spot, and noticed the pain was right where a vein is...First thought in my mind is \"BLOODCLOT!!!\" (if that is only one word). I start to get a bit anxious,and then my arm starts getting red, and feels swollen...I'm a goner\n\nThe first thing I do as I'm panicking and getting dressed (so I'm not naked if I die), is think of my porn history, my porn collection, and a couple toys I have stashed! \n\nI rush around the house, still wet, clothes half on, two fingers on my neck checking that I still have a pulse, deleting browser histories, deleting porn files, and gathering the couple male masturbatory sex toys I have, to throw them in the bin outside. \n\nMy neighbors must think I'm insane. Here's comes a guy in fuzzy slippers, jeans, and a bathrobe, carrying a garbage bag that clearly has only 2 or 3 objects in it, with his finger on his pulse, in zero degree weather...then I slipped and fell, flinging my bag into the air. \n\nAs I'm swearing and clearing the snow off of my bathrobe, I realize the bag has broken, and I don't know where my toys went. All I see is white fluffy snow; all they see is a semi naked guy on all fours switching between: throwing snow around, checking his pulse, and looking to see if his arm is anymore swollen, on an ever lasting loop. \n\nI find the toys and shove them into the bag as quickly as I can, and covering the bag with my robe. I look up and instantly they both found opposite ends of the universe to peer at, as if they had no idea I was even outside. \n\nI finally run back inside, make sure the computer is clear, and finish getting dressed. By the time I finished everything, I had calmed down a bit, because the pain subsided. But now I sit here half panicked thinking \"the pain is gone, thank baby Jesus...but what if the clot has moved from my arm and is making it's way to my chest!?\", and finding humor in all of this, and giggling to myself.\n\nDAE-panic and instantly resort to getting ready to be found dead, by clearing histories, hiding/throwing away/destroying things you wouldn't want your friends and family to know about; only to realize you just panicked, and you maybe shouldn't have reacted like that? \n\n      ",

I don't usually answer the door if I'm not expecting anyone, but for some reason I did.\n\nOne of the things he said in his pitch was that the average person waits 10 years before seeking help for depression or anxiety. That really got to me, because that's me. I've been so afraid of seeking help that I only recently took the first steps of talking about it to someone for the first time. When he said that, I realized I don't want to wait any longer and it helped my resolve to ask my doctor for a counselling referral. \n\nAnyway, I just thought this stat might let people know they're not alone. If you've decided to seek help, congrats! If you haven't been able to do it yet, I feel you and I'm rooting for you. I also wanted to mention that this sub (though I've mostly been lurking) has been a huge help in encouraging me to do something about my anxiety. Thanks everyone!\n\n(One other thing he said that I found funny in a weird way - \"These things affect so many people - it could even affect your loved ones or yourself.\" And I was thinking, \"I know, I was in bed due to anxiety when you knocked on the door.\")",

Anyone around?\n\nEdit: thank you all for responding, you don't know how much better you made me feel.  I'm home now, the ER doc said it was viral conjunctivitis, and I have a follow up with an ophthalmologist tomorrow.  I feel a bit silly, but after all, we only have two eyes!  I took something to calm me down so I can get some sleep, here's hoping it works.  Thank you again.\n\nEdit 2:  Home now and just waiting for the pharmacy to call and tell me my Rx is ready.  It's a viral infection, not conjunctivitis (which is also a viral infection), another \"itis,\" but I forget the exact words he used.\n\n[Puppy](http://imgur.com/h2tLWjs) did great, she went from being hesitant to joining in and having so much fun, she didn't want to leave.\n\nAgain, thank you all for taking the time to reply, you lifted me up and I greatly appreciate it!

It makes me feel like woozy, out of sorts, a bit of pain, light headed with some pressure inside my head. I didnt get it checked out cause I had a MRI earlier in the year and it came out fine (this was before this feeling started) and it lasted a week. I thought it was maybe due to my crappy sleeping schedule but I sorta fixed it and it happened again. Also I was freaked out cause i had a weird well I dont know if it was a dream, it was in the morning and i was half asleep and I had a dream where I was standing awkwardly and suddenly I collapsed and my legs became paralyzed and I had a weird feeling in my head and my legs and I cant tell if I actually felt that way or not but as soon as I fully awoke there was nothing wrong with my legs. It could be just a dream but Ive had sleep paralysis and this felt different, my heads been feeling weird since but so far nothing major and it kinda goes away if im distracted but soon comes back in quiet moments.\n\nOnly thing I can think of is \n\n1. I noticed some connection with my taking gummi or multi-vitamins. Could be a coincidence though. I've been taking them because I was having numbness and tingling in my legs and someone recommended that I take vitamins as I might have a b12 deficiency. \n\n2. Anxiety? I might be tensing in my sleep. I wake up with body pains sometimes.\n\n3. Sleeping \"wrong\" in a bad position etc.\n\n4. Something serious.\n\n\nAnyone felt this way before?",

            "selftext": "So today was my first therapy session. I was pretty nervous at first, it was a little awkward to just tell this stranger about all my most hated anxiety thoughts, but, she was really easy to talk to and never made me feel crazy. I was able to tell her about my family history and about my most recent panic attacks and the huge health anxiety I developed this year. Tomorrow I go talk to the doctor on staff for a physical evaluation (they like to do a full body treatment) and discuss possible medication to help me through this first phase. All in all I am happy with how it went. She was super reasonable about how I need to come semi weekly due to money. And she gave me a writing/art asignment to stay engaged between sessions. I'm glad I'm taking this step for my own well being. She says she's confident I can find my true potential and be all I can be.\n\n*edit: Wow, thank you guys sooo much for the encouragement. It means a lot when my choice to seek help has been met with mixed reactions at home. I feel great now!",

Even when I do I generally only make it to the couch near my bed. I know that I stay confined to my room because it is my safe zone but it is starting to make me feel like there is no end in sight. I am also eating very irregularly because I won't go downstairs.\n\nMy family is pretty volatile and I have two half brothers who are very young and are always screaming and being obnoxious. On top of that my mom constantly yells at them because that is her version of parenting, it was the same when I grew up. Because of this I try to avoid them at all costs but I don't think that I will ever get better by living like this. \n\nI'm not sure what to do with myself and I feel hopeless and lost in my life. ",
