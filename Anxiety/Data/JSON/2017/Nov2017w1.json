The rush of adrenaline and angst was nearly overwhelming.  However, I took deep breaths, caught myself, told myself everything is fine, thought of 5 things I was grateful for and one thing I was super excited about and looked forward to in the future.  Soon after that my anxiety was gone and my mind was on to other things.  I didn't give those dreadful thoughts any attention and I didn't entertain them.  I simply let them pass and subtly replaced them with positive thoughts.

It\u2019s going to the review board. \nUpdate 2: I have switched my PCP from this sludge bucket to a woman doctor with glowing reviews on ZocDoc. I will meet her Saturday and hopefully get proper care and see what to do about my anxiety. \n\nI\u2019m a woman. Let\u2019s start there. I\u2019m in my mid 30s. \n\nI went to my doctor to get started on the path for anxiety treatment. I suffer almost every day from anxiety and it\u2019s been like this a long time. I\u2019ve finally taken the courage to realize I need help and so wanted a referral. \n\nThe doctor barely looks at my chart. He didn\u2019t even ask why I felt anxious. He asked me what I want to do. I told him I want to see a psychologist. He asked if I want meds. I told him no. He told me both those things won\u2019t help. I should seek help from family or church. I told him I don\u2019t see those sources as being helpful. To which he went into telling me to have children. It will give me purpose in life. I was shocked. I told him that doesn\u2019t seem like the right medical thing to do for this. \n\nBut he took it upon himself to give me a lecture about women, biology, genetics, evolution, and how the opioid crisis is due to men not having children and real jobs. He told me that women are so stressed these days because they work too much. He said that in the old days they were even more stressed - why? Because they didn\u2019t have washing machines. He went on and on about how women should be having children and so should men. Some crazy biological link to all this. Nothing really about how exactly it helps anxiety. \n\nI was livid! He knew nothing about me and nothing about my situation to even have children. It made no sense and felt like a violation of my right to even choose to have children. Plus he wasn\u2019t really medically doing his job. He just spouted his agenda. I got the referral and I told him I will never come back there. \n\nI can\u2019t imagine someone closer to the edge of despair with anxiety and seeing this guy. I\u2019m now shaken by this event which is causing me to feel anxious. As a women I have to say to other women - do not take this shit! Also - really?! - having children cures anxiety. Omg. ",

            "selftext": "I want to share my experience with Zoloft, in hope that it may help some of you who are on the fence about taking medication. \n\nI've had generalized anxiety throughout my entire life and have seen a therapist in the past. There have been 3 points of my life where my anxiety was the worst, with the most recent one being May/June of 2017 at work. \n\nI was struggling at work, struggling to manage my workload and was constantly feeling overwhelmed. In May, I was told I had to give a presentation in front of the entire company, by myself, my biggest fear. After that news was delivered, I didn't sleep for an entire month, and was constantly worrying and freaking out about the day where I would have to deliver the presentation. My anxiety had become so severe that I was having panic attacks when I came into the office in the morning and I regularly contemplated quitting my job and leaving it all. My work and personal life suffered, and my anxiety consumed me. \n\nI knew I needed to do something about the way I was feeling because my anxiety combined with the insomnia was actually making me go insane. \n\nI decided to see a psychiatrist who put me on 50mg of Zoloft. She had me start at 12.5mg for 3 days, then 25mg for 3 more days, until I finally worked up to my current dosage, 50mg. \n\nThe first 2 weeks were a little difficult. I still couldn't sleep and I would get diarrhea whenever my dosage increased. But i distinctly remember over 4th of July weekend, which was about 2 weeks after I started the medication, I started feeling like my old, happy, smilegirl55443 self again.\n\nSomething in me shifted, I can't explain what it is. I've been on the medication for about 4 months now, and I'm the happiest and most successful I've ever been, in both my work life and personal life.\n\nSome positive life changes I've made in the past 4 months:\n\n* Made a core group of new friends who I really connect with on a deep level\n* Switched to a plant-based diet\n* Fell in love with my job and initiated a re-org at my company, which led to my position morphing into my current dream job\n* Read books on personal growth and strengthened the relationships in my life\n* Started loving myself again\n* Started sleeping like a baby again\n* Learned to take criticism without becoming upset - I now think of it as a positive thing and a way to improve myself in a new way\n\nI hope my story helps anyone who is thinking about trying medication. I too was at rock bottom, desperate to try anything to feel normal again. Medication has different side effects for everyone, and this is only my experience, it may be different for you.\n\nI hope this post helps someone who is feeling the way I was a few months ago.\n\n*Edited for formatting.

            "selftext": "Bit of a backstory. I\u2019m a 30 year-old male who has never had a history of anxiety. Sure, I\u2019d get stressed on occasion but I always knew how to cope when I did. In fact, I\u2019d go as far as to say I was almost too laid back. Nothing ever really phased me. My attitude to life was \u201cif you can change it, make a change. If not, just smile and laugh and accept whatever life is throwing your way\u201d.\n\nThat all changed 3 months ago. My god, did it change.\n\nBack in August, life was going fine. Great girlfriend, great job, happy and on top of the world. Had a bit of a stressful week that week with a combination of work, etc., but nothing worse than I\u2019ve experienced before. By the end of that week, everything was resolved and nothing major was going on. I went out for a couple drinks that night. Went home, then went to bed.\n\nThe next day, I woke up and my body felt like it had slept through a fucking war zone. My body was coursing with adrenaline, I felt tense all over and a tightness in my chest that I had never experienced. That tightness intermittently switched between a moderate and severe tightness to a moderate and somewhat severe sharp pain, localised around my heart. As soon as I woke up and realised that feeling wasn\u2019t fading, I got myself to the hospital (having grown up learning that chest pains in a young, relatively healthy male = bad). My breath felt shallow, my face and hands were tingling all over, my body hurt. It was pure, unadulterated hell.\n\nI went to the hospital and was seen almost right away. I explained my symptoms and they did a battery of tests (blood tests, ECG, chest x-ray, etc.)They kept asking me if I\u2019d taken any drugs but I assured them the only vice I had put in my body the night before was alcohol. After a few hours and no relief, I came back with a clean bill of health. I was told that it would eventually subside and to just wait it out. If things didn\u2019t get better, then to come back the next day.\n\nI went home, in debilitating pain and discomfort, and forced myself to sleep that night. I fly regularly for work, so my emergency jet lag sleeping pills were a god send. \n\nThe next day, none of the symptoms subsided throughout the day or night, so when I woke up in the morning I took myself to a different hospital closer for me.  Same thing, same tests, same results. I asked them if they could at least give me something for the symptoms, even if they didn\u2019t know what it was. The way I was feeling, I knew painkillers or a Xanax or something would have helped. Nothing. They told me to schedule an appointment with my GP so that\u2019s what I did. \n\n1 agonising week later, I was able to see my GP. When she asked what the issue was, I explained to her the 24/7persistent, relentless, crippling pain and discomfort - which at this point had graduated to:\n\n-\tTightness in chest\n-\tChest pain\n-\tBack/shoulder/neck pain (which I can only assume is from my body being so tense all the time)\n-\tLower back pain\n-\tHot flashes\n-\tTingling face/arms/hands\n-\tRinging in my ears (this is fun)\n-\tInability to sleep (unless I supplement with sleeping pills)\n-\tCharged with adrenaline, inability to sit still or just stop and think (not because I have worries going on in my head, but because I was so crippled with this pain and discomfort)\n\nAt that point, she ran some more tests but couldn\u2019t find anything wrong with me. She consulted with another Doctor and at that point, diagnosed me with anxiety.\n\nAnxiety? I didn\u2019t believe her. None of my problems were mental. I wasn\u2019t anxious or stressed out about anything (with the exception of this one issue). There\u2019s no way it could be stress! We went back and forth and I finally agreed to see a Psychiatrist if she would also refer me to a chest and lung specialist.\n\nAnyway, after seeing a chest specialist, lung specialist, more GPs, a psychiatrist and a therapist, along with a battery of tests, it seems that it is anxiety. And it is pure, crippling hell. I went through heroin withdrawal one time in my life, and that was a walk in the park compared to this. \n\nI used to be a happy, carefree, go-lucky guy. I\u2019m now reduced to a shell of someone, so overwhelmed with pain and discomfort, that all I can do is breakdown and cry at the end of each day. I have no escape. No \u201csafe zone\u201d. Unlike other people who I speak to about anxiety, I don\u2019t have any triggers. My baseline level of feeling is my body being locked in fight or flight mode. I\u2019ve been experiencing a physical 3-month panic attack and my life is hell. \n\nAnyway, I don\u2019t say this to make you feel guilty for me. I say this to apologise. I used to think that people who suffered from anxiety (or depression for that matter) just had the wrong outlook on life. All they needed to do was smile a bit more, but on a brave face and just get on with life. \n\nI now realise just how sincerely wrong I was. Anxiety and depression are very real. And now, experiencing it first hand, I can only offer my sincerest apologies. Not just for being flippant about these two issues, but because I truly do sympathise now for those of you suffering. I know I never did before. So, I\u2019m sorry. I\u2019m so, so sorry for what you all are going through.\n\nFor those of you who are curious - I\u2019ve tried beta blockers, but don\u2019t seem to get any relief until I get to 80-160mg (2x a day), and even then it\u2019s only about 60%. Though it does take it from unbearable to bearable. I\u2019ve taken Valium and Xanax to ease the symptoms on days I needed to focus, which helps alleviate the pain by about 70-80%, but I\u2019m well aware of how addictive they are so I can\u2019t consider these a long term option.\n\nAt this point, I\u2019m at the end of my rope. I used to say I would never, in a million years, take antidepressants. But then again, I had never experienced what this actually feels like until now. I guess sometimes we\u2019re all talk, eh? After speaking with my psychiatrist and those close to me, I\u2019ve made the decision to go on an antidepressant (Mirtazapine). At this point, I feel like it\u2019s my only option. I wish this wasn\u2019t the case, I wish everything was back to normal, but unfortunately that can\u2019t happen. So now, I\u2019ve decided to take the medication in an attempt to get my life back.\n\nAnyway, I\u2019m not sure why I\u2019m telling you all of this. I guess I feel like I don\u2019t have anyone around me who knows what I\u2019m going through. My girlfriend is amazing and supportive, but she (understandably) just doesn\u2019t get what I\u2019m going through. \n\nThanks for listening guys. And again, for what it\u2019s worth, I\u2019m sorry. \n\nHere\u2019s to the Mirtazapine. Hopefully it works.  \n",

I feel as if my personality has disappeared!\n\nI\u2019m not sure if this is down to overuse of technology (not being able to live without a phone in the hand) and having a shorter attention span due to that. I definitely don\u2019t read as much as I used to, however I find I don\u2019t concentrate on that as well anymore either.\n\nEverything seems to take much more mental capacity then it used to and it\u2019s very frustrating.

            "selftext": "My dad has been an alcoholic since he was 16, long before I was thought of. It continued throughout my childhood. He was never abusive. I would go to his house on the weekends and it was normal for the most part.. minus the fact that every single day after lunch he would start drinking. I remember looking in the kitchen trash can and counting at least 13 beer cans. He got sad when he was drunk. Again, no abuse whatsoever, but it still wasn\u2019t a good environment for a child to be around. I would also wake up to the sound of him vomiting in the bathroom.\n\nI remember going to a couple of AA meetings with him. He had gone to several rehabs before. He was in an intensive rehab facility (2 year program) when my mom had a psychotic episode and was diagnosed with schizophrenia. I was 12. As my legal guardian, my dad had to come out of the program to care for me. The first night home, he gave in and drank. Since that moment on, I\u2019ve abandoned hope for him. He decided to give into alcohol in my time of need. \n\nI get that addiction is harder then I could ever really understand - but the idea of being around my dad or talking to my dad gives me so much anxiety. Ever  since I turned 18, I haven\u2019t spoken to him. He will send me cards but I have never responded.\n\nI feel guilt for avoiding him but I feel so much anxiety when I think about speaking to him or seeing him. I feel like I will be happy with my life with not ever seeing him again. And it sounds so harsh because he\u2019s never really DONE anything to me - compared to some stories I hear - but it just gives me so much unnecessary stress.\n\nDoes anyone else have anything similar? Am I in the wrong for avoiding him for the rest of my life?",
