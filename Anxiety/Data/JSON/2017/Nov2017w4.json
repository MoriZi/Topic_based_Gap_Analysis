            "selftext": "I am sure all of you have seen the posts across Reddit about the fight to keep net neutrality, and the FCC upcoming vote to dismantle it. Personally, I feel that we need to keep net neutrality, but you are, of course, entitled to your own opinion. I don't want to get into the politics of it all, but I'm sure you can find that elsewhere on Reddit.\n\nSo this is just my story about how it has been going for me to voice my opinion on the matter, even when I get social anxiety. Just picking up the phone and having to talk to another human can be difficult sometimes \u2014 whether it be calling the store to find what time it closes or having to get support with technology \u2014 it makes me nervous just thinking about it. So you can imagine what it must feel like to want to voice my opinion \u2014 something I rarely do as it is because I worry about alienating people or making them upset. Especially when it comes to politics.\n\nThe main things that concerned me about calling my local representatives were... What do I say? My representative doesn't share the same political beliefs I do, so are they going to argue with me over the phone? Is there something special I need to do when they pick up? Maybe I should just hang up...\n\n**First off**, I used [this website](http://www.battleforthenet.com), which is an automated system that auto-dials your representatives for you, based on your ZIP code. Plus, it even gives you a basic script you can say. Literally, I said this word for word: \"Hello. I just wanted to call to express my opinion about net neutrality. So... um... yeah, I support 'Title Two' net neutrality rules and I would like you guys to publicly oppose the FCC's plan to repeal them. I would really like if you guys would contact the FCC Chairman and demand that he abandon his current plan. I don't believe we need legislation, so instead we really need you to stop the FCC from getting rid of the existing rules. So um... that's all. Thanks.\"\n\n**Secondly**, the dude on the other end of the line is just some staffer \u2014 often some college kid that takes phone calls for the representative's office. They were practically a robot themselves, and to be honest, they don't care to have a discussion about my political beliefs, even if they don't share them. There wasn't any argument, nor did they say much of anything at all.\n\n**And finally**, I didn't hang up! I stuck with it, and just read the script. When the lackey on the phone was done hearing me out, you can press star (*) on your phone, and boom \u2014 it hangs up on them, the automated system gave me a pat on the back (seriously, she says, \"You're doing great!\"), and it automatically calls the next representative.\n\n-----\n\nAt the end of the day, I felt relieved that I did it. I was so anxious about it at first! But when I spoke with these people, they didn't say much of anything, and I didn't feel scared because I realized their whole job is listening to people complain. The guy on the other end of the phone is just some dude who literally listens to calls all day and just forwards your comments to the man or woman in charge. The most that was said to me was when they asked for my address and ZIP code to confirm I lived in their district. That was it.\n\nLong story short: even with my anxiety issues, I found it to be easier than I expected, and it made me feel like I accomplished something.\n\nP.S. My first attempt was in the evening, after my representatives' offices had closed. I did this because I didn't want to talk to someone on the first try. So I just left them messages on their voicemail expressing my opinion, but I found that sometimes their voicemail was full. So I need to try again the next day, because otherwise, I'm not being heard.\n\n**tl;dr:** I expected to feel huge social anxiety calling my representatives to support net neutrality. Turned out to be the easiest thing ever, and made me feel like I made a huge accomplishment regarding my condition. It also means I actually did something that allowed me to voice my opinion, which made me feel good.",

The only calming thought i have now is that i won\u2019t be alive for much longer so things will be okay, and i don\u2019t mean that as a threat at all, it\u2019s never even say it outloud, it\u2019s just genuinely the only thing that can bring me back to myself.\n\nMy parents often tell me they\u2019re proud of me but all that does is make me feel so much worse because i know it\u2019s a lie. How can you be proud of me when i have done absolutely nothing with the last 3/4 years of my life? They think they\u2019re supportive by telling me about jobs but it always turns into a fight because they both think they get how i\u2019m feeling but obviously they don\u2019t, it just feels like a jab at me whenever they mention it. They\u2019ve been separated since i\u2019m 8 years old so it\u2019s not like they\u2019re \u201changing up\u201d on me, im just hearing it from two angles i guess.\n\nI don\u2019t even know what posting here will accomplish, i don\u2019t know what anything i do will anymore, part of me feels like i\u2019m wasting any money i do have on therapy because it\u2019s not like i\u2019ll magically get better by speaking, I\u2019ve just grown to like my therapist at this point so i think i just go to get a chance to spend time with someone who isn\u2019t in my family. \n\nI think i want to be locked up for a while, not in prison or anything, just somewhere away from my current life, i want to be someone else because i really just exist, im not living, most of the time i don\u2019t even feel like i exist, i have to talk myself into even believing i\u2019m alive and real.\n\nSorry for such a long post, i don\u2019t expect anyone to read it, honestly, i just felt like i needed to get it out there, but i don\u2019t think it will help, i just wanted to share. \n\nEdit: Im really overwhelmed and surprised with all the responses, i appreciate and have read them all, i won\u2019t be able to respond to everyone simply because i don\u2019t want to repeat myself over and over, but i am so grateful for everyone\u2019s words. Thank you, you have all definitely made today easier for me.",

A lot of people tend to cringe strongly over embarrassing moments in their lives (example: cringing over that one time they looked stupid in front of their high school crush).\n\nHowever, I noticed that I don't tend to have that problem, but I seem to make up for it by cringing over hypothetical scenarios in my life that NEVER ACTUALLY HAPPENED but COULD HAVE HAPPENED. For example:\n\n*\"WHAT IF I made an off-color joke that one time?\"*\n\n*\"WHAT IF I said something stupid during this situation?\"*\n\n*\"WHAT IF I ended up saying that thing that I almost said one time?\"*\n\n*\"WHAT IF I did something stupid during my speech?\"*\n\nAll the cringy HYPOTHETICAL scenarios just pile up and start eating me alive. And its stupid because none of these scenarios actually happened, but I'm still consumed by these thoughts. Shit sucks man.\n\n**Summary:** I have a bad problem of constantly \"cringing\" over hypothetical scenarios in my life that never happened but COULD HAVE happened.  ",

It's about a girl, who everyone thinks she's perfect, when in reality, she has a problem simply talking to people, a lot like anxiety, such as walking into a store, only to leave immediately because she got scared, to having trouble to saying how she feels, to writing what she wants to say on paper, which, I sometimes do myself, back when I was in a technical school. couldn't talk to anyone normally unless i knew them for like a month in class. Later, she becomes friends with someone, who tries to help her make friends and socialize.\n\n\nreading about it reminded me a bit of myself, especially the writing out instead of talking bit and being nervous around people, and also my friend, who is a bit like her as well.\n\n\nI'm not trying to offend anyone, nor am I trying to make light of anyone's problems. I just figured it would be nice to share this, and see what people think about it.\n\n\n[here] (http://mangapark.me/manga/komi-san-wa-komyushou-desu) is the link to it.

I get so much support from my friends and family but I still sometimes feel like they think having an anxiety disorder is the same thing as having \"normal anxiety\" but often. So when I'm not doing well at all mentally and I'm \"calling out for help\" nobody really takes me as seriously as I'd need at that moment.",

            "selftext": "I\u2019m 21 I\u2019ve had anxiety for a long time, and more recently diagnosed with OCD on top of it. I\u2019ve been in a psychiatric hospital, I\u2019ve been on so many medications I don\u2019t even remember them all, and I\u2019ve been to more therapists than I can count. \n\nThis isn\u2019t a pity post. It\u2019s a success post. Yea I\u2019ve found a medication combo that works, and a great therapist, but those don\u2019t even come close to love. 7 months ago I met my girlfriend, and my life changed forever, and anxiety took a seat for once. She\u2019s just, so supportive, I ask her all the time why she puts up with my mental problems, or just me in general. It causes fights, I hate that so much, but she still stays with me. She says every day she loves me. She is unimaginably supportive of me and everything in my life, whether good or bad. \n\nToday is thanksgiving and I\u2019m anxious, as I\u2019m sure most of you are. She\u2019s a few states away for the weekend with family, and I was having a panic attack in the car on my way to dinner. Just the thought that she\u2019s my girlfriend and loves me helped that anxiety go away. \n\nShe\u2019s single handily the best thing to ever happen to me and my anxiety. I don\u2019t remember what it was like before we met and I honestly don\u2019t want to. My life is good for once. I\u2019m happy. I\u2019m hopeful. These are all such new feelings to me. She doesn\u2019t realize that her coming into my life and choosing me is the best gift I\u2019ve ever received in my life. \n\nThe point of this post is to inspire hope. Hope that you reading this will find your special someone one day. Not just a girlfriend or boyfriend, but your soulmate. If they\u2019re the right one, they\u2019ll give you more than any person or material possession can ever give you, the ability to fight this illness we unfortunately have. That person can make it stop, even if only in temporary moments. It\u2019s the most amazing thing in the world. \n\nGood luck everyone. I hope you find your forever person. They give you the gift of hope, courage, and love. And love is one hell of an SSRI. ",
