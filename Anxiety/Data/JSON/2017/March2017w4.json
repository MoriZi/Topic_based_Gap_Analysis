I've been having sleep hallucinations that have only gotten worse, so I finally made an appointment and hoped he would refer to a sleep specialist as necessary.\n\nI had to talk about my anxiety. I had a long, slow panic attack pretty much the entire day on Friday. I knew that it could be related to my sleep issues as well. I could tell he was a family doctor and wasn't awesome about talking about stuff like that. Maybe he was and I just didn't know what to expect? I'd say that if I mess up at work I almost need to leave because I get so anxious and afraid I'm getting fired and he just asked if I was a perfectionist... Either way, I of course couldn't stop crying. I've never talked to an actual medical professional about it. He referred me to their in-house counselor to talk to a few times, and she'll probably refer me to another therapist. I'm not too worried about that, I'm just glad I'm getting this to the forefront of my life. I've spent years crying alone and brushing it off, and being afraid to get prescribed something that will zombie-fy me. But I'm taking steps, which I guess counts for something. ",

Or maybe a release of adrenaline in your chest. Your hands start to get cold and tremble and you start to sweat.\n\nThis is what happens to me. It happens multiple times a day over every little life stressor that pops up at home or work. It is debilitating to me.\n\nHow do other people deal? Are their lives just less eventful? Do these stressors just not bother other people in the same way? I feel like one issue I have is that the physical reaction to stress comes with two problems: the intense reaction my body has triggers a stress feedback loop. And, the physical effects are so strong that getting stressed at 9:00 am about a work problem means I still experience the physical symptoms for hours later. I go home at 5pm still shaking and sweating even though I'm not actively thinking about the problem I had earlier,\n\nAny insights?",

I know therell be good times ahead but at the moment i just wanna hug and some sedatives. This is mostly just a rant, but i guess i thought its a feeling some of you might relate to, and its important to talk about. Hope everyones doing okay!",

            "selftext": "__You are OK. You will be OK.__\n\n__Preface__: None of the information below is new. My recovery was made possible by the words and work of other, more elegant writers and professionals who recommended the acceptance method. Primarily Dr Claire Weekes and ex-sufferer Paul David. If you would like to learn more, please look into their books - they are the Truth.\n\nWhat separates the me of today and the me of years past? What separates the calm, happy, generally anxiety free me of today to the anxious, confused and utter scared me of the past? Understanding and time.\n\nI have seen the absolute depths of anxiety, panic and fear. I have felt hopeless, scared and alone. I have hidden in the toilet stalls at work having panic attacks for no apparent reason. I have been so anxious that eating becomes impossible without gagging. I have experienced all of these things but when I think about them, I can't help but smile, for I see now the truth about anxiety.\n\nWhen I suffered from anxiety, I tried desperately to figure out why I was feeling the way I did, figure out what was wrong with me and what I needed to do it make it all stop - to this day I cannot say exactly what was the catalyst of my high anxiety state but I do know for a fact that it simply does not matter. I had always been prone to worry, but I had never experienced anything like this before, not even close. I frantically trawled the internet for months trying to find my way out of this maze only to land on various anxiety forums where people would be comparing their war wounds, talking about the new medication that they had been prescribed or going over their myriad symptoms. Nothing was helping, all I could think about was my condition and how horrible I felt. I wanted the old me back. I was feeling more and more detached from reality, I felt like I was living in a dream, I was losing weight and I carried around an unfocused feeling of dread for most of the day until I would gradually start to relax and feel better once in the safety of my home in the evenings.\n\nAfter living like this for a long time, I was lucky enough to come across a new resource on the internet which suggested an alternative approach to recovery from anxiety; __Acceptance__\n\nI cannot stress enough how importance Acceptance was to my own recovery. If you want the capital T truth about anxiety recovery, Acceptance and the passage of time are your 100% guaranteed ways out. I promise you.\n\n__We fear what we do not understand__\n\nWhy did my anxiety persist, even when there was no external stressor to cause me so much distress? I had a good career, a great family life, no financial issues - I had nothing to worry about. My anxiety persisted because I was terrified of how Anxiety was making me feel. I was afraid of being afraid. Every weird, unexplained sensation that I was experiencing I was reacting to in fear, trying desperately to make it stop, make it go away. I was fuelling the anxiety with more fear and more anxiety. Acceptance is the way out. But before you can accept, you must understanding. It is much, much easier to accept the awful way you feel if you first understand _why_ you feel the way you do.\n\nI do not work in healthcare or medicine, but if you are currently suffering from high-anxiety, I strongly recommend you research as much as you can about whichever symptoms you are currently experiencing. You will soon learn that everything that you are currently experiencing is not only explainable by science, but expected. Let me repeat that, it is expected that you feel like the way you do in your current condition. Your body is doing exactly what it should be doing. Your body thinks it is under attack, your sustained level of high anxiety and stress has got your fight or flight system working in overdrive, your protective systems are going haywire. Your body is trying to protect you.\n\nSo what should you do? Acceptance. Give yourself permission to feel weird, detached. Give yourself permission to feel nauseous, sweaty, jittery or unreal. Your mind and body are completely and utterly spent and need time to heal. Do not fight and struggle. Do not try and make it all go away. Love yourself, let yourself feel like crap, let yourself heal. Live your life alongside anxiety, take it with you to the shops, to the movie theatre, wherever. Drop all the coping mechanisms which you have developed - no more checking in on Anxiety forums, repeating anxiety mantras, using safety behaviours.\n\nThis last point is critical. It is too easy (I know I did) to 'accept' in the wrong way. Acceptance is not sitting at home waiting for it all to go away and then getting impatient when you see no improvement. That path will just lead you back into the same cycle of trying to struggle your way out of Anxiety. To paraphrase from a post from another ex-suffer, true acceptance is in the book you are reading, in the movie you are laughing at, in the way the wind feels in your face when you are out for a jog. True acceptance is being OK with the fact that for now, you have anxiety, and getting on with life regardless.\n\nThat brings me to the other critical part for my anxiety recovery - Time. Even when you are on the right path to make a full recovery from anxiety, it will still take time. Trust me here, do not put a timescale on your recovery. Do not get impatient or discouraged. There __will__ be set-backs, expect them. There will be times when you think you are recovered and then you are thrown back into the Anxiety tailspin. The difference here is that you now know the Truth about anxiety and what action you should take to get back on track - utter, utter Acceptance. Each setback will be shorter and less impactful than the last. Eventually you will have an intimate understanding and acceptance of Anxiety and Fear that people who have not suffered from an Anxiety illness simply cannot possess. It will make you stronger.\n\n----\n\nWhen I discovered the acceptance method, my mind was so clouded and unfocused that it took me a while to truly start applying it. But eventually, normality started to return to my life, anxiety burned itself out and my mind and body healed. Now, with a clear mind, and a whole lot more understanding, it is so painfully obvious why I felt the way I did. You cannot extinguish a fire by pouring gasoline onto it. You cannot mend a broken arm by hitting it. You cannot calm an anxious mind by worrying.\n\nWhen I saw the light at the end of the anxiety tunnel, I knew that I wanted to help at least one person to recover from Anxiety. Hopefully this post can do that. I would love to answer any questions.\n\nThank you.\n\n__You are OK. You will be OK.__\n",

            "selftext": "I've been thinking about my anxiety and why it seems to affect me so much and so often. As with any problem, I tried to reduce it to the simplest concept possible - at its core and in the brain, I think anxiety is quite simply a combination of an emotion and a memory. It is fear and the memory of pain. Fear being the emotion of self preservation, it is natural to feel it when faced with something we remember causing us pain, both physical and emotional (especially considering both are processed using the same parts of the brain). If we are faced with the prospect of walking through fire having being burned before, it will make us anxious. If we are faced with the prospect of a breakup having being broken up with before, it will make us anxious. However, I am not afraid of physical pain, wounds heal after all. So why should I be afraid of emotional pain? I tried my best to adopt bravery instead of cowardice in how I face everyday life, and I tried my best to convince myself that emotional pain, like physical, is non permanent and non terminal, and therefore not something I should be afraid of. And it works. It really does. With every day I my anxiety fades a little more. So learn to be brave - don't be afraid of pain. \n\n",
