Everyone else left either because I was too \"embarrassing\" to be around, or there were just better people out there apparently. If I had friends, I probably wouldn't be so scared to eat in front of other people. But I don't know, I try to make friends, it's just fucking hard when there's a constant voice in the back of your head telling you to shut the fuck up. Plus I'm at that stage in high school where everyone already has their own \"squad\" and nobody seems that interested in being friends with the loner girl. So I guess I'll just eat in the stalls for the rest of high school:/ ",

Sat up after a set and felt my heart flutter a little bit (which it does sometimes, randomly. Ive been getting these since I was 13 and dr's say they're benign) which escalated my anxiety a tad since I hate getting them. Rested a bit, then switched exercises. Suddenly i got this growing cramp pain on my left side under my rib cage. The pain stressed me a bit and I felt another heart flutter. At this point my heart rate climbs a bit higher and higher and I start going into \"oh shit\" mode so i stand up, grab my things and leave my garage where my gym's set up. I'm playing music on my phone so i try to focus on this. I go upstairs.. pace around a bit, splash cold water on my face. I feel my heart rate which is probably around 130 or so BPM but no way i was checking it then. I just thought to myself, this is like cardio! When I do cardio it beats this fast. I'm FINE. I'm OK! My heart can handle it, just let it do it's thing - i'm sure the exercise which raises BP, coupled with slight adrenaline rush that happens in that fight or flight feeling is what's keeping my HR up. If I let it do its thing it'll regulate out and slow back down to normal like it was before I worked out at all. (have this irrational fear of my heart beating so uncontrollably fast that i'll drop dead. it's silly and i KNOW its silly)\n\nAnd I listened to myself! Calmed down and no longer in freak out mode. :) Hopefully I can pick back up on my arm workout to finish it off! Luckily I got about 30 minutes or so in which isn't too bad.\n\nAnyways thanks for listening. it IS possible to beat panic disorder, for those who have it, especially if you have it based around your health and symptoms.",

I used to be really sociable, have plenty of friends, I did well in school, had hobbies and interests - I was weird, but enough people liked me that I didn't think about it. After high school it was like the blinders were taken off and I started to see all these things about myself that I really, really hated. I started struggling a lot in social situations, I flunked out of a really good university, I couldn't hold a job, I gradually lost contact with my friends... I was a mess.\n\nBut I got back up. It was a little harder than before but I still had enough momentum to keep going. I moved back to my old school's city after a semester away, ready to do what I had to in order to re-enroll, but things got worse. I had a *lot* of anxiety already, and you know how people are - they pick up on that. I reconnected with my friends for a little while but then they all ghosted me because I was starting to act a little crazy. I got very depressed and almost did something irreparably bad to myself.\n\nSo back with mom and dad. Again. Starting at another school. Again. I got overwhelmed and started having panic attacks before classes and pulled out. I got a job and worked full time, but I was not good at it, my co-workers didn't like me much, and I was fired after a year. So I'm back in school yay. Except I'm only in two classes and still struggling. Everything is just... *so hard* and it's exhausting and frustrating and humiliating. I had high hopes for myself, but I don't see how to salvage any of that from what I've let myself become.\n\nI think a big part of my problems is that I'm so used to trying and failing that I'm afraid that's the only outcome if I try again. I look at myself and think \"I've given up,\" because I have. I don't want to! But I don't know how to make life work for me anymore. I don't know how to connect with people. I go out somewhere and it's impossible to think or talk clearly through the static in my head that makes me nauseous and stutter and my heart pound. What kind of a life is one where you can't even talk to someone without turning into an idiot or crying after? I can't function like this. I'll never be able to work like this.

I think the anxiety comes out the most when I have to imagine myself explaining something. I think the thought of being nervous terrifies me, and when i feel a twinge of nervousness, all hell breaks loose.\n\nToday I felt the anxiety come back during a short one on one meeting with my manager. I completely stopped listening to my manager and just focused on the anxiety and allowed it to exist within myself. I told myself, \"this is your anxiety, allow it to be here and completely surrender to it\" and SOMEHOW i was able to prevent a panic attack. I felt nervous the whole time but I didnt end up panicking. I feel like a million bucks right now.",

            "selftext": "It starts on 1st of March. I had just rougly two months of winter school holidays. For the whole two months I was in absolute fear of going back to school. I tried to forget about it and enjoy what was left. I avoided looking at calendars. I avoided going out so I don't feel the spring come. But now the time has come.\n\nI am autistic and honestly I don't really get to get along with people and due to my previous ignorant acts (I didn't know about social boundaries. I'm still learning and trying to act natural) I have made many enemies. I do not hate them but they hate me. You should've seen how they look at me. They don't bully me or anything, it's just the look and the atomsphere that is killing me. I haven't seen them over the what, five years and bam we ended up in same high school. You know what's even greater? Four of them, all nicely packed together, are now classmates with me!!! Da. Fuck. \n\nAnd you see my middle school was a nightmare. Being an austistic means you have to learn all the social things yourself. The younger self back then haven't learned much. I really tried to act natural and do the good deed but welp I fucked up bad. Cringey stuff. And here is the kick. A relationship went reeeaally bad and I ended up being sexually assaulted, many times, even during school, and was a famous slut!! I ain't even pretty or fit. So uhh you see the whole middle school became a trauma and is an awesome anxiety trigger. Everything related to it, even trival things are now my greatest fears. People, area, books, even certain foods. \n\nI thought I was finally out of it when we moved a little bit farther. But damn sweet goddamn heavens they are back, now in my same class!! Hohohoo I will see them every day and in a month or so mouths will start whispering. Wowie you say. And here I am, a week left, experiencing near death fear.\n\nYou know it. Heart racing. Narrow vision. Headache. Breathless. Strangling. Good luck back school with four nice anxiety triggers! Not two but four!!! Lovely!!!!! Cool!!!!!!! Awesome!!!!!!!!!!! Fuckin kill me already.",

The period after that however has been a long road of recovery and I am very much on the mend.\n\nI have applied for somewhere between 150-200 jobs over the last 2 years and only been invited to 4 interviews during this period. \n\nI am delighted to share the news that I have now found employment which I am due to start on Monday 27th of February.\n\nSince this news, the tension in my shoulders and neck I have had for longer than I can remember has gone away. For many years I have felt like I have had the whole world on my shoulders and I now no longer feel this way, I feel completely relieved and I am actually excited about what the future will bring.\n\nI have not felt excited or good about anything for a good 9 years. \n\nI'm really glad things are starting to look up, after a very painful and tough period in my life.\n\nI think it just shows with patience, and the right help you can over come your anxiety, or manage it which I am very fortunate to have done.\n\nI look forward to your comments and replies on this post.\n\n",
