If any of you are anything like me you worry about every single thing there is to worry about and lately the one thing that's been killing me is the anxiety that I'll never find a girl who loves me....was always told i was a good looking, athletic guy but that didn't keep me from thinking I'm not good enough for anyone. So we are all going through similar things and the best thing we can do is encourage each other and be positive. I've found it's easier to be helpful and positive with someone suffering with anxiety than it is to be positive with yourself. You got this, don't listen to the negative thoughts in your head, and don't listen to the mirror when its says you're ugly. I love you all",

I ran out of bread a couple days in and all I had left was cereal and pasta.  I ate the cereal in the mornings and, just to have some semblance of a \"varied diet\", mustered the courage to seek out the shared kitchen for ten minutes at a time to boil some pasta.\n\nBut on Saturday morning I ran out of milk.  I told myself \"ah, not to worry, I'll go buy some later today as I'm not busy at all\".  I didn't, of course.  Not only is Tesco nearly *twice* as far as the university (that's almost a *five minute* walk, people!), you also have to cross *several* roads to get there!  Coming from a place where you have to worry about maybe one car every five or ten minutes, this is a big issue for me.  So no shopping on Saturday.\n\nSunday came, and my breakfast options were limited.  But I had already considered this the day before, while I was coming up with excuses to not just buy milk.  You see, I had heard that some people eat cereal with water instead of milk!  And there's an endless supply of water (included in my rent) in the en-suite bathroom right next to me!\n\n**DO NOT DO THIS.**  Holy shit it is like eating soggy chlorine.  It is NOT worth it.  I soldiered through maybe three or four spoonfulls before sneaking out to the kitchen to scrape it into the bin.  I could not wash that taste out of my mouth for the rest of the day.\n\nToday, after skipping breakfast, I attended my first lecture at uni.  Having already been out, I hadn't made myself comfortable in my room so I was kind of ready to leave again.  I had done it once, I knew what I was doing, I vaguely understood the basics of crossing roads.  So after spending maybe thirty minutes reading and re-reading the Google Maps page for the nearby supermarket, I put on my jacket and went out into the rain.\n\nAnd you know what?  Nothing happened.  I'm not dead.\n\nNot only do I have more milk, I got a pizza, some bread, some fizzy water and some crisps.  But more than that, I feel fucking *invincible*.  The moral of the story is, it doesn't always take courage, bravery and initiative to do something you're afraid of doing.  Sometimes all it takes is the threat of eating another bowl of Tapwater Flakes.\n\nNext household chores to conquer are doing the laundry and emptying the bin.  Wish me luck friends.  I hope this story motivates even one of you to go do that thing you need to do.",

            "selftext": "For a few months now I've been almost always thinking about my existence and how life is the weirdest thing ever. Most of the time I don't feel real and I'm actually starting to believe life isn't real. I look at the world around me and the things near me and just think how weird it is that I'm seeing this right now but it doesn't seem like it can be actually real. \n\nI've been feeling very discounted from the world and I'm not excited about anything anymore really, sometimes I am I guess. I think I'm suffering majorly from  depersonalization and it sucks. If I'm in the middle of a conversation sometimes I'll just look at them and kind of study their face and just think like \"is this person real\" and just have a bunch of thoughts like similar to that. There's too many things that run through my brain to explain and I really want too but yeah. Also sometimes I'll feel sad or depressed and get the urge to tell my friends which makes me think I'm doing for attention and sometimes I do want attention for it which really bugs me. \n\nAnyway I felt like explaining in small detail what I've been going through lately. I'm not a great writer so sorry if this wasn't laid out well. I'd like to write so much more about what I think everyday but I'm getting anxious thinking about all the things I could write about that I'm not remembering right now. \n",
