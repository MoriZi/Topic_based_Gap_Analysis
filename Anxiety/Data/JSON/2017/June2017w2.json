            "selftext": "Sort of a rant\n\nFor about 2 to 3 years, i have been struggling with depression from my school and home, and this year i started to have suicidal tendencies and anxiety. Thankfully, my suicidal tendencies have calmed down a bit, and i dont feel like running my head under the wheel of every truck that passes. However, my depression and anxiety continues to haunt me.\n\nFor me, depression started as \"you cant do it, youre a failure\" to more of a demotivator. I dont have an urge to do anything anymore. I dont care about school. I dont care about my grades. I dont care about my future. I dont care about my health. I dont care about my friends. Yet, i do. I do care about all of these. My anxiety makes some of these things have the upmost importance, and makes me stress over it constantly. To the point where im not sure what i want to do half the time. I used to get barrly any sleep, and now i get around 6-8 hours of sleep, yet i always wake up dead tired, stay that way until i come home. I then take a nap from around 3 to 9. Miss or eat dinner late. Then i feel somewhat awake,but not motivated to do anything. So i just sit there until around 1 or 2 when i get tired again and start doing my homework.\n\nI just hate not caring enough and caring too much. I dont have control over my life anymore. Everytime i try to think of what i will do in my future, the only option i see is suicide :/\n\nMy grades suffered, especially my math grade. It was to the point where i got 2 failing grades on my assessments when my teacher talked to me. She was like whats going on, and i wanted to tell her my situation, but it wouldnt help me. She just told me to actually study, and i said i will. I stopped actually studying for my tests a long time ago. \n\nI dont want to tell my other friends about my situation because we're all engrossed about our other friend thay missed school for a month and came back looking depressed and talking to himself and reciting bible verses. Lifes a fucked up thing.",

I've lost jobs, homes, my physical health over and over again. I can't remember what it was like to not be mentally ill because I've been ill longer than well. And the work I do for myself has not just included getting myself out and about, it's about trying to create a voice in my head that is kind to me so that I don't just live in a world of hostile noise within my own skull.\n\nThere's a part of me now that sees those posts and thinks: That's not depression then, is it? If you can do something external that makes you feel better then you're just sad.\n\nBut I also think this makes me a bit of an arsehole because I am glad that people get better, and I have been told that my experience of chronic and enduring is different from most people's experiences because apparently for most people it is acute and episodic. So you know, I'm just bitter because I feel like I got the short straw. But I'm lucky in other ways so I might need to shut my face.\n\nJust a rant. I'm exhausted.",

            "selftext": "I've suffered with bipolar disorder my entire life, but only began having major anxiety over the last two years. This is paralyzing anxiety. Full body tremors, inability to eat in public, decline of most personal relationships, poor work performance, etc. I have been dating my boyfriend for 3.5 years and he's never once judged me for being so unstable. He's caring, patient, and kind. \n\nLately my anxiety is the worst it's ever been and my apartment had fallen into decline. I came home from work and my air conditioner wasn't working. Every time I tried to call my landlord I couldn't. The thought of someone coming into my \"sanctuary\" was too much. I was hysterical and just dealt with the heat. (I live in the south where it's currently in the high 80s temperature wide). A week had passed and I wouldn't let my boyfriend come over because it was so hot. On Thursday, it had been a week since my AC broke, I came home and my apartment was cool. I texted my boyfriend (the only other person with a key) and asked what happened. He taught himself to fix air conditioning units in 3 days, came over after work and fixed it before I got home. \n\nI was speechless. I cried for about an hour because I was so thankful. I've never had anyone be this understanding. I've never really had a healthy relationship before him. Just the fact that he would do this because he knew how I was suffering made me feel the best I have in months. I'm currently cleaning my apartment for the first time in months because I feel calmer than I have in a long time. \n\nAnyway, I just want to let you all know that our anxiety doesn't have to prevent us from finding love. They are few and far between, but there are people who will understand and lift you up rather than brush you off or think you're \"crazy\" for being anxious about every day things. ",

I have a job washing dishes in a chain restaurant, and every day I pace my house for hours before I have to leave, watching the minutes count down to when I must leave the safety of my home. Thankfully my job is right up the street and I can cut through the park, because if I walk along the main road I feel everyone looking at me as they drive past. I'm conscious of my clothes, the way I walk, how fast I walk, and I'm terrified that I'll trip over a rise in the pavement or a misplaced twig. When I meet people I'm careful with my words and my manner of speech, because I'm terrified that people will judge me or my thoughts...so I invariably end up sitting silently. My partner tells me that when I sit by myself ( I usually sit forward with my elbows on my knees, fingers interlaced and looking at the ground) I look old and sad, as if the weight of the world is pressing on my shoulders, and that I'll cry at any moment--and that's exactly how I feel every day. Even as I write this my heart begins to race with the knowledge that someone will read this and think me childish or needlessly frightened. I am tired of being scared, tired of this crippling anxiety and depression. I just want to see the starlit mountains again, in the wide open places far from other people, where I know I am safe from all judgements and critiques. Every day is a battle for my sanity, for my peace, and I feel like I'm losing.",

            "selftext": "My anxiety hit a peak last year when I was working my last job, which was at a theme park. I worked there for 3 years until I just couldn't handle it anymore. Now I feel that I have developed a work phobia. I sort of have a job now, which is background acting for film and television, which is okay, but the work isn't always promised, and when it is, it takes up my entire day and I usually don't find out until the day or night before. It's a major inconvenience for making plans with friends and it doesn't work well with my college schedule at all. \n\nI need money, but I don't want to end up in another job that only gives me anxiety. Being in university and not having a degree yet, I feel I'm forced into taking only shitty jobs. If it were up to me, I'd take a job at a library or somewhere with a similar environment, but I just have an aching fear in me that I'm gonna hate whatever I end up with. I grew to really hate the general public. I know whatever I get won't be the same, but it just freaks me out.\n\nDoes anyone have any ideas or ways that I could get over this fear? ",
