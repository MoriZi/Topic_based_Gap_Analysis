Sometimes, I get so overwhelmed by how happy he makes me and how much I love him, that I get terrified. For some reason I feel like what we have is too good to be true, and I feel like the universe is going to try to get back at me, and something tragic is going to happen to him. I always have intrusive thoughts about him getting killed, or getting in an accident. It's awful and sometimes it prevents from being fully present in the relationship. Sometimes it keeps me up at night. Has anyone ever felt something similar?\n\n(Also: My anxiety+depression is the most manageable it has been in years. I have been taking Zoloft for about 2 months now, and I've never felt better. However, I still have a lot of worries about certain things, like my boyfriend's safety for example, that haven't completely gone away. Thanks for any advice guys.)",

I have always been kinda high strung, but recently I have been having really bad anxiety (stomach cramps, nausea, skin tingling, lost 2 pant sizes in a few weeks) since breaking up with my girlfriend (she wants to be poly, and I gave it a shot and couldn't handle it).  If I don't have my entire attention occupied on something, it gets even worse.  I'll start tearing up out of nowhere and my body will feel like its shaking a bit.  So this has resulted in me losing friends and my work performance is suffering.  No one wants to hang out with me anymore, and I feel like I am making more mistakes at work.  I am not sure what I am looking for, maybe some understanding.  My family is almost no support, dad says things like \"just get over her\" or \"shes not losing any sleep so why should you\" and mom just panders the crap out of me.  I have an appointment with a social worker in a couple weeks, but I'm not sure if I can last that long without something happening (not gonna kill myself, just might freak out at work or something which will make the situation worse).\n\nEdit:  Thanks for the support, everyone.  I got my therapist appointment moved up to Monday so hopefully I will be able to get back on my feet sooner than later.",

I heard a woman saying no repeatedly and a man say shut up and cursing. Then nothing, it was quiet again. For 30 seconds I didn't know what to do, I couldn't breathe and my heart was racing. I haven't been this scared in years. I couldn't see them in the dark trees but I knew I had to call the police. Using breathing techniques I described everything to the 911 operator. It took about 10 minutes for the police to arrive and I thought I was going to have a panic attack knowing someone was out there that needed help. I woke up my roommate but the police told us to stay inside while they searched. Then like out of a horror movie it starts to lightning, thunder, and pour rain.... Well it turns out it was a couple who live in the complex arguing loudly and other neighbors heard them and called as well. The police assured us no one was hurt. It's possible I over reacted due to my anxiety but the police officer said I did the right thing by calling. I will probably over think this tomorrow but right now I feel proud of myself.

I don't know if it's my anxiety, overthinking or what. People find it odd because I am extremely outgoing/fun in real life, but once they text I almost always text back in a way I would never do in real life. For example, if even here on Reddit people make jokes in the comments, in real life I could easily comment the same stuff. But online, I panic, get awkward and say something serious or non related. Anyone experience this? And if so, how do you get over it? Thanks!",

            "selftext": "This post is long, and the first time I've ever written something like this out. I'm at the end of my wits and I feel like I might actually go mad, I don't know if writing this will help me, I don't know if anything will help me. But right now I'm out of ideas, and I'm hoping that there's someone out there who has been through what I've been through and has dealt with it, but I don't think there is. I have to warn you, if you're afraid of death then reading this post may only make it worse. Anyway, this is my story.\n\nIt wasn't that long ago, perhaps only a few months that I was in the darkest place that a human can be. Sitting on my kitchen floor with an empty bottle of wine and a knife on my wrist, ready to end it all. And for the first time in my 25 years of existence I though about life and I though about death, after all I was going to experience both within mere moments of each other. A multitude of thoughts raced through my mind. What will it be like? What will I see? What will I feel? But what I realized terrified me, nothing. That's what you'll see. That's what you'll feel. That's what you'll be. \n\nDo you remember what it was like before you were born? When you sleep? No. And that is death, it is the end of existence and the end of you. Everything that you are and everything that you could be will be done and you will cease to exist. These are hard thoughts to have and in reality I rejected them. I rejected them for a long time, even though I'm an atheist I've always kind of felt like there was an afterlife, or that I didn't care. I remember myself once saying \"I don't care what happens to my body when I'm dead, I'll be dead after all!\" saying it without thinking about it. \n\nBut, I carried on with life, woke up the next morning and remembered that I was going to end it, but stopped, and I felt happy. I enjoyed myself for the first time in years and was positive about the future. Then New Years came, it was late 4am or so and I was having a chat with a friend, he was drunk but I wasn't, I was reformed, no more alcohol for me, I was so proud of myself. But my friend seemed sad about something and I pressed him for answers, he admitted that he wanted to make an impact on this world, because he believed that it was all that he had, that after this there is nothing, and only your name remains. I had been rejecting these thoughts for so long but suddenly to hear another person say them drove them home. Made them real. One day I won't just die, **I will stop existing** there will be nothing of me. But what's even worse is that there will be nothing of everyone I know. All my friends and family will one day cease to exist and be no more. Nothing but memories in the minds of others, minds that will one day fade. \n\nSince then everything has felt... surreal. Like I'm not really here, I'm constantly feeling faint, nauseous, and afraid. My heart-rate is accelerated and I can't stop shaking. These thoughts drive me and punish me and I can barely sleep. Everything around me seems insignificant and I can't enjoy anything because all I can think about is the inevitability of my own demise. But what makes it worse is that I think about my family and friends, how one day they too will die and cease to exist. And I'll never see them again, I want to burst into tears every time I see my mom or sister. I can't live like this but at the same time I'm terrified of dying. For the first time in my life I tried praying, I begged God to send me a sign, to put my mind at ease, anything. But I got nothing.\n\nI don't know what to do. I don't know what to feel. I don't know anything anymore and I feel like I can't talk to others. Everyone just goes about their daily lives, but why. Why do you care. You didn't get that job? Your room-mate is annoying you? **WHO CARES** nothing matters, stop worrying about such trivial things. How do people live normally, how did I live normally. I want to erase my thoughts, restart, but I can't.\n\nExistence is torture and my mind is a trap.\n\nEdit: This got more attention than I thought it would get. Thank you for all the replies, I'll likely be reading and rereading them many times. \n\nEdit 2: This thread got so much more attention than I could have imagined, there's been so many people offering advice and sharing their life experiences. I don't think I've ever seen so much helpfulness and friendliness on the internet before and I just want to say thank you. I think I still have a long way to go, maybe these thought's will never disappear but today has been the best day since they began and it's in a large part due to the people who spoke on this thread. I've read every post here and will keep reading them. In short just thank you, everyone.",

            "selftext": "Hey All,\n\nJust wanted to throw my hat in here. I have suffered from anxiety and social anxiety for as long as I can remember. I'm a guy in my early 20s, and I thought \"enough is enough\". I was constantly over analyzing myself and every situation. My flaws seemed huge to me, and I assumed everyone thought negatively of me all the time. My life was consumed by a spiral of negative thoughts and social anxiety. \n\nI went to my doc, admitted my social anxiety, and he prescribed me Lexapro 10mg/day. I took my first pill a few days ago, and not two hours later, I had nearly complete relief of my anxiety of all kinds. The bad thoughts completely stopped. They say it could take up to six weeks to get any benefit from the medication, but that was not my experience. The bad side of that is I was not able to sleep well the last few days, and am just now not nauseated. I'm waiting for more side effects to appear, I'm sure they will. I can feel the sexual side effects that are described and the inability to cry, but I'm still joyful. \n\nI can't believe it. My life has done a complete 180 as of earlier this week. I went from being socially awkward and anxious to just being... me. To being a leader. It's like all the noise from outside was turned down to near silence and I can think and focus and perform at the top of my game. I lead a meeting yesterday with 20 people whom I don't know and just sailed through it. I was in disbelief the whole time.\n\nI'm saying this to say that there is still hope - don't discount SSRI's like I did for so long. This isn't an ad for Lexapro (although I'm a believer now), but I hope this might convince one or two people to give meds an honest shot. I believe in myself now. I believe in my life now!\n\nI'll answer any questions. Best of luck everyone. \n",

I don't know any other way to put it. I'm physically there and thats about it.

            "selftext": "At first it started with she wouldn't drive. She absolutely fears driving. I didn't really think of it at much, but over the next couple of weeks, she slowly started to build up to the point where she will no longer leave the house. She has been consumed by her couch, only sitting in the same spot day after day. Once she told me she was so scared to even stand in our kitchen- a place she once felt completely fine in- for even just a moment. She was shaking.\n\nI love her. I inherited her anxiety; I know what it's like to feel scared, depressed, and lonely. We all fight our own battles. I try to help her in any way I can: my brother doesn't drive, and living out in the country that leaves it up to me to take him to school and BBall practice; she no longer cooks, so sometimes I will cook dinner for my family. I'm 21. I have a job, I just started training with a personal trainer a couple of months ago, and I'm going to be going back to school soon too. Simply put, I want to live my own life. I'm starting to get tired about this situation.. Maybe if she tried, I wouldn't feel so bad.\n\nHer doctor told her she had bipolar disorder. She did not take the news good, but after being prescribed new medicines, she thought she would feel better. My Mom was happy with that. Her doctor also wanted her to start seeing a therapist, and she did. (The only time she was out of the house last month.) I was excited for her- maybe she could finally get the help she deserves. It seemed like things were getting better. Once my Mom got home from the therapist, she was even happier! Only because the therapist reassured her she wasn't bipolar, but \"only anxious.\" So her therapist had her stop taking some medicine. \n\nInside I am LIVID. \n\nHer doctor, a woman she has been seeing for 20+ years VS. her therapist, someone she has only met with for an hour. It feels like things are getting worse. She doesn't eat, and when she does she only eats sweets; she barely moves, not even to get the remote to change the TV.\n\nI don't know what to do anymore. Today we fought again. This time because I had an appointment with my trainer right when my brother would be getting out of school, thus he wouldn't have any ride home for a half an hour. To her, this is the end of the world. But back when I was in High School, when she was feeling better, she had no problem with me waiting 30+ minutes.. \n\nI know things like this take time. She told me years ago, when I was a baby, she got to the point where she wasn't even able to walk. She had to crawl room to room. Through therapy and time she got better. But now, when she won't do anything? I just don't know.\n\nAre there any kind souls out there that can offer some advice? Anything I should do? Anyone that has gone through the same thing/a parent that has at least? My ears and heart are more than open.",

            "selftext": "I think this is gonna being long, so sorry for that, but every comment are welcome. Thanks\n\nThis is a story that it repeats itself since my first relationship, Till now I have 3 long relationships (I am 30 yo btw), 2 with woman and 1 a man, that's not the problem itself\n\nIts always the same, I began confident and when the time pass I become more clingy and needy, even posesive with my partners, i think that kills the 2 first relationships, Now with my third one I was able to do different, till one day on last june I have a  horrible panic and anxiety attack, since then it was a roller coaster for me and my boyfriend, I go to 2 therapist, none of then know how to deal with me, then my boyfriend almost break with me in september and my reaction afterwards was of guilty and a enormous sadness and depression, Then I tried to kill myself, don't do it at last, but go the next day to ER and then to a psychiatric hospital, being med since then, the anxiety got calmed and I was more in control now, except from times when I think my relationship is in trouble, then I become more anxious, clingy, needy and with a overwhelming fear of lose my BF, of course this is something he no tolerates, additionally I tend to develop some kind of second \"personality\" to deal with people around me because Recently I notice I have a terrible social phobia and cant deal with people I don't know normally. This is ironic, because I want to Know new people, hug everyone and being over expensive with the ones that I like. I'm kind of ambiguous right now, and don't even know how I feel like this\n\nLast year on december 31 my BF was decided to broke with me definitely, this was my worst nightmare come true, so I burst in tears, scream and get the worst panic and anxiety attack I ever had, then calm down, dominate myself and try to speak with him, at last we are more or less stable and talk the things, even that day I knew about this second \"personality\" of mine, \nHe said he cannot tolerate more my anxiety and that he wants me to being an adult, acting like one, being independent and not needy and clingy with him. I know my relationship is almost over, but at least I want to prove that I am worthy of being alone with myself, I don't want him to get out of my life, at least I want to become a friend, but i don't want to make him suffer because of my condition, and I don't want to be alone without someone who understands me and hear me (I am crying, is fear itsellf, I know) \n\nI am working with myself, try mantras, meditation, even going to see a doctor yesterday to make a formal diagnosis to know my condition, but I still wonder if this is by the lack of something chemical or it is a condition itself, even if is the anxiety that trigger everything else\n\nI am so confused, I need a guide and it will be more than a month to know the results of yesterday's diagnosis test\n\nI don't know how to deal with this anymore, don't even recognise myself or what I do, I lost control of myself at this point, do you have any idea?\n\nThanks for hearing me",
