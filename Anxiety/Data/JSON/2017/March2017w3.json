I said, well if I treat my mental health issues, this might go away and she replied \"it's not a mental health issue. Do you want to continue or end the session?\". \n\nWell I wanted to continue but I felt like I was going to pass out so I stupidly said I'd leave it and I left like an idiot. \n\nI was in there for 8 minutes. It took me longer to park. Now i feel real dumb that I even messed my therapist session up. What the fuck...\n\nEdit: I'm such\u200b an idiot. It felt far to official for me, there was nothing relaxing about any of it. How any one can go these places to feel better is beyond me. I actually feel like killing my self over it. The worst bit is, I'm not even sure she was a therapist, she said when I went in that I won't see her again, she's just going to decide on treatment, being therapy or meds. \n\nI haven't felt like this for years :/ I wish I never went.

I have anxiety about different things but one that is very strong for me is unwelcome noise.\n\nI grew up in a very quiet neighborhood where I had no problems falling asleep as it was really quiet at night. At some point - can't pinpoint when or why, but about 14 - I became very sensitive to certain noise, especially at night. For example the noise of a saw or any construction noise would just drive me crazy. At night it was enough when I could hear faint buzzing of music or a TV at low volume. I am not able to sleep and become super anxious and agressive. If the noise does not stop I feel like I am about to explode. I will have to put earplugs in and do everything possible to not hear it anymore. Sometimes it's a cycle, because as I get more anxious I get more sensitive to noise and that makes me more anxious. Ideally I want to live somewhere very, very quiet and always be able to control what I hear.\n\nHowever, I do not mind some other noises, even when they are very loud: storms, rain, trains driving by close, I don't care. I can fall asleep to that just fine.\n\nIt sounds so lame but noise from neighbours/outside has driven me into many a panic attack. Anyone else have this?",

Anxiety can be cured, you can feel normal again and you could even say that managing it is a cure anyway. People without anxiety manage fear and anxiety on a day to day basis it's just it comes naturally to them without even noticing, that's the point we need to get ourselves back to in order to be cured. I'm guessing I'm not the only one that feels de-motivated when they see this phrase so maybe use it less on here guys?",

Not just the party but the fact I wouldn't know many people and it would all be a little awkward. \n\nSo I got to the party and my mind was racing. I didn't know where to sit, who to talk to. So I went straight the bar, for a beer and just stated Floating round. After been in the party for 30-40 minutes, it was like someone just zapped the anxiety out of me and said 'Enjoy your anxiety free night'. It was so awesome!!\n\nAfter the party I went back to a house for an after party and got home 7am this morning. \n\nI just wanted to share this with you guys. I felt amazing yesterday and it's a reminder that's anxiety is a bitch but it's 100% possible to beat it. \n\nBut yeah, currently hungover in bed laughing about last night :)",

On top of that I'm in my mid 30s and never been in a relationship so my self esteem is cripplingly low.  \n\nLately at work my anxiety has been getting worse.  I'm convinced that the people I work with think I'm a creepy loser and constantly talk about me behind my back and even text each other when I'm around.  I'll dwell on it for hours and get a feeling of a knot in my chest.  \n\nI also have trouble in social situations.  I replay conversations in my head over and over again wondering if they found me strange.  Sometimes a memory of an embarrassing moment from years ago will just pop into my head and haunt me for a while.\n\nI've seen a therapist 4 times now but I'm starting to think she isn't equipped to deal with my issues.  I think I may need to move to a psychiatrist and take a more clinical approach.  \n\nI'm supposed to see a doctor next week to see if she'll put me on depression and anxiety medication, but I really don't know what to expect.

I even forgot to remove my birthday from Facebook this year like I've done all the other years, so people and classmates could perfectly well see that it was my birthday. *I* don't care about birthdays but I know that *others* do and it hurts to know that they didn't care about me enough to at least aknowledge it. (Should I mention that several people in *MY* classes, whom they've never met IRL, shared my birthday today and they were perfectly able to congratulate them)\n\nMy dad really wanted to do something out of my 20th birthday but I just wanted to stay at home, however I agreed to go out to eat except every restaurant was fully booked and we ended up having to go grocery shopping at 8 in the evening. Ended up with good dinner, but a mom storming off because of a \"cheap and bad steak\" or something like that. Then everyone fell asleep at 9 and I watched Iron Fist the rest of the evening. It just sucks and and I am super fucking anxious about this year.\n\nIn 3 weeks I am having surgery and the last cancer screening because the docs think there might be something super serious wrong with me. Keeps me up at night. Worst part? My mom thinks I am making it up and is constantly hinting at me that all my \"\"symptoms\"\" would go away if I would stop... (and then she does a derogatory sign for being gay)\n\nI am starting uni next year and I was supposed to work this entire year but every time I try to hand in a resum\u00e9 my social anxiety makes a mess out of everything and I get humiliated and rejected again. I have handed in 30 resum\u00e9s or more and I live in an area with no jobs. Idk if my dad thinks I am a pest living in the house, but I can see it in my mother's eyes. Everytime I hand in a resum\u00e9 and don't get an answer, it's like she believes that I've never handed anything in or that I am lying about actually getting a job.\nEspecially now with the surgeries - I have to lie down for 2 weeks after each surgery and idk she just hints all the time that I made up the symptoms to get these surgeries to avoid getting a job - since it's so convinient that I have to get these surgeries right now.\n\n---\n\nSorry^for^ranting\n\nEdit: Sorry^forgot^to^post It's 2 hours ago, now :/ ",

I was first assaulted at age 3 then again from ages 6-11 (physical abuse during the day, sexual abuse at night). Both my parents were homeless alcoholics and drug addicts. I was homeless by age 14. I was assaulted many times. I worked extremely hard in school and always turned everything into something positive. I am grateful that I saw what drugs and alcohol did to my parents so I knew I never wanted that life. I was accepted into ivy leagues and other amazing colleges throughout the country. I am now in my last year at a prestigious university. I have worked two jobs to support myself. I have seen a therapist for several years, I do trauma informed yoga, I\u2019m a huge activist on my campus. I have helped write and pass legislation to help survivors of sexual assault. I give talks, I help others, and every time someone hears my story (in more detail than previously stated) they are shocked and usually respond with \u201cbut you\u2019re the most positive and bright person I know how can all this bad stuff happen to you?\u201d Working 50 hours a week, going to school full time, running several clubs, volunteering at nonprofits and being diagnosed with complex PTSD, anxiety, OCD and depression is not easy to balance but I enjoy working hard. \nBut for the last 9 months my anxiety has shifted into extreme depression. I never understood why I was given the diagnoses of depression many years ago as I am a social butterfly, I\u2019m active, I don\u2019t feel sad, I don\u2019t sleep more than usual, or really have any other symptoms that don\u2019t also fall in the PTSD diagnoses. But now I no longer feel the anxiety. Which before would motivate me to do a thousand things at once. Now I can\u2019t motivate myself to get stuff done, I don\u2019t socialize anymore, I am highly critical of myself (when before I would never think about myself because I was too busy), and suicidal thoughts are frequent (don\u2019t worry I have the resources, I am ok, promise).\nThe anxiety is bad but I much prefer that because it got me to do all I need to do. Now I have lost all motivation, I am going from the Deans Honors List to dropping classes, and I am just overall calm to a point that I don\u2019t care.\nI obviously don\u2019t need help addressing why I feel this way. I have a life filled with very traumatic events and I have recently went through many health issues.\nI was just curious if anyone else had severe anxiety that has shifted almost to a calm depression in that you just don\u2019t care about anything anymore.\nThanks in advance.\nAlso this is my first reddit post so if I did something wrong, sorry!\n",
