Good luck buddy, those things contain *sugar* - here's an 18-part slideshow on why you now have diabetes.\n\n\nIf you stop doing all the things these articles tell you to stop doing, your life just becomes a hollow shell of nothingness. I wanted to write this to remind people - and myself - that these articles are created for ad revenue, are oftentimes devoid of any real scientific research, and prey on anxious people like you and me who read this in a desperate effort to silence the negative voices in our heads.\n\nSo fuck these guys.

Often I know that someone has annoyed somebody else before they even know it. I pick up on people's insecurities and what they like/don't like and remember it months later. I can tell straight away what mood people are in, whether they want to joke, be left alone, etc. I have to make very quick judgements of people in my job and although I always stay open-minded, usually they prove accurate. \n\nI think this partly drives my social anxiety. I see what behaviours/personality traits annoy others or don't go down well, and I make a mental note not to do that myself. The problem is that every behaviour or personality will annoy someone, somewhere, so there ends up being very little that I can \"safely\" say, hence I say very little.\n\nDoes anybody else feel like this?

Anxiety makes it impossible to trust your instincts since it's indistinguishable. \n\nI've talked to the guy quite a few times, and I've lived in this small town off and on my whole life.

            "selftext": "Around 4 years ago, I went through the worst Anxiety I have ever been through. I didn't understand what was wrong with me and thought I was dying. \n\nI couldn't be left alone or go outside without going through a panic attack. I would convince myself that every lump I felt was cancerous and make numerous visits to the hospital only for them to send me home after hours of waiting.\n\nI was prescribed Diazepam/Beta blockers and almost prescribed Citalopram but I only choose to take 2 Diazepam and that was it. During this time I told my mum that I wanted to be sectioned because I believed that I wasn't in control of myself and was unaware that it was my Anxiety causing me to think this way. Every appointment I attended was also through the help of my mum as I felt like I couldn't go to any of them alone.\n\nI received two visits by mental-health specialists, 1 of them believed I should be on medication for life and that I would need to take medication to function and do normal things. The other told me that I should prove him wrong.\n\nAs time went on I began counselling and attended a group CBT class. At first I felt like nothing had changed and that I had wasted my time but looking back on it now, I feel like everything got put into perspective around that time when I realised that my Anxiety is just a part of me and that no matter what discomfort I go through it always ends up going away, I chose to feel the Anxiety and not let it affect me doing anything I wanted to do.\n\nWithin the past 2 and a half years I have attended job interviews, bank/doctor appointments and completed a Mathematics course. I now do my own food shopping, have a part-time job which is a customer-facing role and I'm in the process of working with a job agency to get a better job. \n\nTo cut a long story short, I have went from having severe agoraphobia and panic attacks (-4 years ago) to working a part-time job and doing everything for myself. I'll probably delete this post in few hours but I hope it helps somebody on here who feels like their life will never change. I'm also open to any questions, if there are any.",

We have no HR in our office because of our size, so any issues mainly go through our manager or to the regional manager.This seems like enough background.\n\nOn the job today we ran into an issue and it became apparent that our manager did not coordinate any access for us to do our job. These things happen, albeit more than they should, and we took care of the issue as best we could. Some people were not thrilled but the damage was mitigated. \n\nMy manager sent an accusatory email claiming he told me to coordinate access. The problem with this is that A. This is not my job, it is his. B. He did not, prior to that point, state for us to get access. We would have gladly. C. He lied in the email with my regional manager on the email seemingly just to call me out and make him look better.\n\nApparently this was the last straw because rather than shrugging it off or absorbing it I got angry. I compiled my emails, and my text messages and got a conference call with the regional manager, my co-worker and another manager from a different department. We had a VERY pleasant conversation. It was the exact opposite of what I thought was going to happen. Granted the rambling on and repeating of saying \"sorry\" and \"thank you for listening\" happened exactly as much as I anticipated. At the end my regional manager correctly gathered that this was not a single time issue, rather an ongoing problem. He is setting me up with a meeting with HR to air any grievances and that retaliation will not happen.\n\nMany people who don't deal with anxiety probably won't get how hard this was. I deffinantly don't have the worst anxiety, but I have a hard time dealing with things like this. I am happy to say it was worth it and hopefully anyone else out there in a similar situation may gain an ounce more courage from this. Thank you for listening.",
