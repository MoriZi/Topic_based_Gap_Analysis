            "selftext": "Today I finally got around to getting my full license. I've been driving for almost 4 years, but that was kind of like a learners license where you have restrictions and can't carry passengers. Two months ago I finally got the courage to book my full test. Two months flew by and for the past few days I have been so nervous. Last night I felt so sick and this morning I didn't even think I'd be able to make it to the test centre. But I got up on time, I left on time and I arrived early. Walked in, checked in and my instructor was ready for me before schedule. \n\nThe 10 minutes before my test when I was waiting, I was surprisingly calm. Maybe because it was too late to back out, so I just accepted that I was going to do it. The test was pretty smooth, I didn't make any major mistakes, we chatted and I drove very well I must say. 30 minutes later, we got back to the test centre, I did a pretty poor parking job but oh well, the third attempt was perfect. \n\nHe told me I did great and I passed. I was sure I would fail before I did my test or that anxiety would get in the way, but I didn't even think about anxiety. I'm still surprised at how calm I was the whole time, I just drove like normal and checked my mirrors a lot. Then just to push myself a bit more, I went to get some lunch by myself. I feel so relieved, I'll hopefully never need to take another driving test! This really goes to show that I need to stop doubting and questioning myself, because we're all capable of doing whatever we want to.\n\nEdit: Wow this got more upvotes than I expected. Thanks for all of your nice comments :) this sub is so nice.",

I couldn't breathe and I was beginning to lose sensation in my hands. When I felt it coming on I realized that my ex wasn't going to be there to calm me down like he always used to be, which sent me into even more of a panic. I picked up my phone and was about to call him (dear god, it would have been bad if I had called him) or 911 (I hadn't decided yet) when my three roommates walked in. I assume they had heard me hyperventilating and sobbing/yelling.\n\nThey all came in, sat around me, and held me and did deep breathing. They said soothing words until I calmed down and regained control of myself. \n\nSo that's it. I did it! For the first time in a year, I calmed down without my ex there to soothe me. I obviously still need to work on calming myself down since my friends rushed to my aid, but I feel a whole new appreciation for my friends too. \n\nLife fucking sucks sometimes, but there is always a silver lining my friends.

I remember I have a test in 1 week, then I remember I have to buy a book, that I have to practice something, then I remember a friend or a girl and start thinking about them, sometimes even making fantasies of being around them and doing cool stuff. Sometimes I manage to get things done, but its always with that partial focus, as if a part of my mind was still occupied with those thoughts.\n\nSometimes, I spend a lot of time anticipating something. I will browse a book on a subject that I want or need to study, research it, think about how it's going to be, then when the time for studying comes, I'm thinking about something else. Sometimes I spend the day thinking about that hardcore workout I'm gong to do in the evening, and then I spend the whole workout session thinking about something else.\n\nSometimes even when I'm talking to people I like I realize my mind will wander.\n\nDoes anyone feel these things?

Had a nice dinner, he made an effort and cooked, which was really nice of him. But then when I was being playful and joking about my day, he got a bit irritated and said 'you know what, panda182, I preferred you when you were depressed'.\n\n\nI know he was trying to be funny, but it really *really* hurt because\n\n\n1. he hasn't been there during any of my dark times, I haven't lived with him since I was 6, so he can refer to my anxious and 'depressed' periods but he really didn't witness them. He has no place to comment.\n\n\n2. Why is it funny to joke about?\n\n\n3. Why can't he be happy that I'm so much (noticeably) happier now? I feel like my old self again, I'm not self harming, I'm not having panic attacks, I'm not going down horrible anxiety spirals.\n\n\nHe's not asked me how I am since I told him I started anti depressants, he's just ignored the situation entirely. Maybe he just doesn't understand how severe it was? His first reaction was 'everyone gets stressed' when I told him. So maybe that's it?\n\n\nIn the end, at least I can say *I* certainly didn't prefer myself when I was depressed and anxious. Since starting sertraline I have honestly transformed into a much more care free, happy person. And I suppose if he can't value that, then I need to suck it up and keep smiling?",

It sounds silly but it's really helped me, it feels empowering like I'm actually fighting the illness and I'm strong. \n\nI also feel like I can identify the anxious thoughts more easily after taking the meds, and so I'll feel them come up, and say \"fuck you anxiety, the the fuck out of here\" and then laugh again, and it's really fun and empowering. \n\nI don't know if this will work for everyone, but it's really helped me feel a lot better and more in control!",

He comes and searches for me and ends up finding it in the back seat of my car. I have idea how it got there. He gets mad that I'm having a panic attack over \"something so meaningless and stupid it's just a phone that can be replaced\" I can't justify my anxiety or explain to him how it makes sense. And it's not meaningless to me. It's how I contact people it's how work gets a hold of me. It's my life line to everything else.

            "selftext": "Hi Reddit so I\u2019ve been a long time lurker on this sub and a couple of days ago I had my freshers party. This is also my first college party ever so I was nervous as fuck. I have had anxiety for a long time now and have learned to control it so far in most areas except for one; girls. \n\nSeriously though I\u2019ve had a pretty messed up love life, got attached to the wrong girl for 2 whole years, chased after her like a puppy despite knowing I had no chance with her and basically had zero experience dating wise at my first college party. \n\nOne thing that\u2019s happened over the past two years is that I\u2019ve improved myself drastically. To be confident, I have to have something to be confident about. I lost 14 kgs of weight, started going to the gym, I write my own stories and try to force myself to be more social. Basically I tried to become the best version of myself. So I decided to go for the party knowing that even if I don\u2019t do well with meeting a girl, I can still have a great time with my friends. \n\nSo I enter the party and start talking to people I know. I go to a Liberal Arts college so everyone knows each other and hugs are encouraged. People are drinking, smoking and dancing everywhere around me and for the first time ever, I danced my butt off without caring if someone was judging me or not. I just didn\u2019t give a damn anymore. I spoke to plenty of girls, both seniors and from my batch, and to my eternal surprise, it wasn\u2019t that difficult. I basically walked up, said hi, and started a conversation. A few times, girls walked up to me and started talking to me. Surprise surprise, apparently I\u2019m not as ugly as I think I am. \n\nI hung out with this one girl for most of the night and she was way too tipsy to even walk. So we literally sat down on a couch and she went to sleep on my shoulder. After a while, I told her I have to leave cause it was really late and I had to get back home. She wakes up and tells me how nice of a person I was for not talking advantage of her. What happened next, I hadn\u2019t imagined happening to me in a million years; she asked me for my number. We\u2019ll see each other in college regardless but I have never felt so confident or validated in my life. It made me feel good about myself, something my socially awkward self hadn\u2019t felt in years. I used to think I\u2019m an introvert but like my friends kept telling me, it turns out I\u2019m a socially awkward extrovert who can\u2019t wait for his next party. \n\nThanks r/Anxiety for giving a 17 year old the time of his life. I\u2019ve never posted here before but I\u2019ve read a lot of posts and taken a lot of advice for this sub. You guys are awesome and keep the memes coming. They\u2019re my favorite part of the community!",

            "selftext": "Hi there\n\nI was just wondering if anyone experiences the same kind of panic attacks as I do, and if you have any ways of helping yourself. \n\nMy panic attacks always come down to feeling nauseous and sick, and the fear of vomiting. This means that even the feeling of being full can send me into a spiral of panic. I have spent many an hour hunched over the toilet convinced I'm going to be sick (but I never am). It usually progresses from feeling a bit sick, to full on shivering/shaking and an overwhelming nausea. \n\nThese kind of attacks only usually come when I'm feeling generally stressed - like before an interview. Unfortunately this means that I often struggle to go somewhere because I'm terrified about vomiting on the bus, or driving while I feel so sick. If it happens the night before, it often leads to me not being able to sleep, and in the morning not being able to eat (not helpful when you're about to take an exam/do an interview!).\n\nI feel like, if I could just stop the nausea, I could stop the cycle of panic, but nothing seems to work. Any hints/tips would be most helpful!\n\nThanks :D",
