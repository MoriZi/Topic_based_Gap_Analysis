I haven't had anxiety this bad in a while.\n\n2 years ago I went off prozac after being on it for 6 years and had the worst withdrawals ever, including a constant headache for over a month. Since then I've become super anxious any time I get a headache Last year I had a stressful event occur, and had a tension headache for over 2 weeks.\n\nNow, I've had this same headache for 5 days now. I wake up with it and go to bed with it. It starts off mild and gets gradually worse and worse throughout the day. Its horrible and makes me think that I won't be able to handle it a minute longer.\n\nSince I associate headaches with my bad experiences, when I lie my head down, my heart races and I think of every possible scenario - I'll search the internet and read stories of people who have had it for years and then that's all I can think about.\n\nWhat has helped you? I'm afraid of Long-term medication as I've taken Prozac for years in the past and despite it not being meant to cause withdrawal symptoms, it did?\n\nWhat normally helps you in situations like this and makes you feel better? Do you take medication?\n\nI want to get rid of the underlying causes which is the headache but that seems impossible. ",

We walked in silence for a little bit, then I finally worked up the courage to try and start a conversation with her by asking what her major is. And somehow, we got to talking for the full 20 minutes before class starts! I've never had such a lovely conversation with a stranger so easily, and we connected on a lot of things.

            "selftext": "Last night, my boyfriend was gone with one of his friends and I decided to do something I'd never done before: go hiking with my dog by myself.\n\nI have anxiety/fears relating not only to going on walks alone, but hiking alone, because it's the woods and it's more isolated.\nBut I took my hunting knife (I'm an avid camper/hiker/survivalist.. if I have a partner with me) and my dog (who is a 20lb corgi and would scare no attackers away!) and hit the trail.\n\nIt was about 4 miles round trip but I was determined to make it, and I just let my mind clear and tried to feel safe and in control. And I totally did! Until I got to the end of the trail (the halfway mark), and went to turn around. It was getting dark, and about 5 minutes into the final 2 miles, a biker goes around me and, like a bad NPC from a horror/survival video game, says to me \"Keep your dog close, there are a lot of coyotes out here.\"\n\nWHY.\n\nWithin 10 minutes more of walking it was so dark I had to use my phone as a flashlight so I could even see the path in front of me, but I focused on keeping calm, checking my corners, and walking fast. I was on the verge of a panic attack and considered calling my s/o and having a good panic sesh at him, but I recognized that my anxiety would not help and the only thing I could safely do was move forward and get out of the woods.\n\nIt took a good 25 more minutes in the pitch black to get out of the woods, but eventually I reached my car, and let me tell you, getting home (and the glass of whiskey that immediately followed) has never been more satisfying.\n\nSo I faced 2 of my fears (hiking alone and the dark/being alone in the dark/the things that want to kill you in the dark) and made it out alive. I don't think I'll try the hiking in the dark thing again, but I just wanted to share this lil victory :) ",

Three years ago the store was bought by an aggressive, business-minded man with anger issues and no people skills. I stuck it out until now, watching my coworkers leave or be sacked for petty reasons, while also suffering from burn-out and overwork. The boss was aware of my anxiety conditions and used them to his own advantage, frightening or abusing me when he was in a bad mood. Today, whilst typically overworked with morning logistics, he chewed me out for some petty reason and I eventually hid in an equipment room and stabbed myself, then calmly went over the road to my doctor to be stitched up. My doctor was horrified and ordered me home for several days to recover from stress. My boss was not amused and a shit-fight ensued between my GP, a nurse, my friend, and my boss. The boss hassled me by phone untill I required sedation and only let up when my doctor threatened to call the police. \n\nAs a result I have left my job due to 'medical issues' at my doctor's urgings and will be spending some time on a disability benefit to get my anxiety under control. I hope I have done the right thing. I fear unemployment more than anything, but I don't think I could ever begin to recover or control my anxiety in that enviroment.",

We both laughed about it and also seriously decided that I should take it. \n(I take concor to stop my heart from racing which helps with anxiety/panic attacks. I don't get them often but I carry the pills around with me just to feel safe. I think the anxiety etc; came from a few traumatic episodes one of them happened two years ago, a group of gangsters purposely hit me with their car after attacking my friends, I'm physically completely fine now, fractured three bones in my spine then but perfectly fine now physically) \nThe movie was of course, terrifying. There were a few times that I definitely wouldn't have minded taking a pill because of the fear felt from the movie and my heart racing fast at the same time but I couldn't really differentiate between the two fears so I focused on the fear of the scary movie. I told myself it was just a film with actors, directors and special effects. Ironically the movie itself is about battling fear. I got over the fear of the movie and subsequently the fear of my heart racing as well. I felt accomplished and perfectly in control. I had a sense of trust in myself. Something I haven't felt in a long time. \nTLDR: Watching the scary movie 'It' helped me battle my fear of my heart racing through battling the fear of a scary movie and not giving in to taking pills or walking out / taking a break from the movie.",

I drink 3-6 cups a day, and it's honestly my favorite part of the morning. I'm keeping a log on tumblr to keep track of my progress.\n\nSo far I've noticed my anxiety is wayyyy less than what it was.
