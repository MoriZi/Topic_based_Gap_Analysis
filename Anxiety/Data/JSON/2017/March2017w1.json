            "selftext": "I'm writing this after the lowest I've ever been. My girlfriend just came home to find me in tears in the corner of the couch. \n\nI've been fighting anxiety and panic for the past year. I had a panic attack 1 year ago February 2nd. I went to a 24 hour clinic and they told me I was dying from my heart rate and blood pressure. I rushed to the ER where they didn't bat an eye and told me it was a panic attack. That thought though stuck with me. I never had another panic attack but lived in constant fear of my heart until January 1st 2017. I tried taking an antidepressant and it sent me into a wild panic of rapid heart rate and hot flashes. I pulled through though and touched it out. A few weeks later, I had one after working out and thought I was having a heart attack. This is what got me me the most and scared me more than ever. I had another the following Saturday and convinced myself that I was fine, but still felt like I was dying. \n\nI went to a cardiologist twice and had echo and ekg done. All fine. \n\nI've been in fear of the slightest bit of exertion from fear of my heart rate now. \n\nThe past year has stifled my music. I haven't written a note in a year. I've been more depressed than any point in my life and just overall terrified. \n\nTonight, in a puddle of tears after battling off the flu for a week ( bad timing right) , my girlfriend came home and hugged me tight. I know this hurts her to see and she's seen it often as of late. I don't know how I'd handle seeing her the way I am. I told her that I'm not weak and I'm just crying because I'm fighting so hard. She told me \"I know. I'm just waiting on you to come back.\" ...... This hit me so hard and it's so true. I'm a shell of myself and occasionally, I show up to fill the void. I'm still happy and myself, but compared to how I used to be, these rapid shifts aren't me. I was so carefree, daring, creative, and fearless. I'm afraid of losing who I was. I went into the bathroom and looked into the mirror and for the first time in a year, I feel like I saw my own reflection. I know the battle isn't won, and I've got a long way to go, but something just snapped tonight. \n\nI understand what you're all going through. We're all in it together. Don't lose yourself because you're still in there. There is still spark. There's hope, happiness, and a face full of smiles that you probably forgot about. You may run to the bathroom at work to let out a few tears like I do, and that's ok. You may cry yourself to sleep at night or cry in the car. \n\nLet me just tell you this. You aren't weak. If you were weak, you wouldn't be fighting. I honestly don't know what inspired me to post this as I don't post here ever. This is obviously an alt, but I just wanted someone to hear if anyone. \n\nWe're all going to get through this. There is an end and a light. You're fighting every day and while you lose the battle some days, you win some days too. Don't give up hope and don't lose yourself. Much love from someone like you. ",

There is also a habit that I keep doing. For some reason, the more I notice that I made a mistake, the more I hold onto them.

It's been so distressing, bringing down my quality of life. I have been suffering from brain fog, rumination, fatigue. Every decision in the day was like I was parsing out whether I would have enough \"energy\" to do this or that thing, then I hated myself for lacking \"willpower.\"\n\nFellow anxiety sufferers, make sure that you explore other answers to your anxiety. Two weeks ago, after almost a year trying to explain a seemingly unrelated medical problem, I was diagnosed with an autoimmune illness called Sjogren's Syndrome. \n\nSjogren's patients often have anxiety and depression for years before they are diagnosed (if they ever are, because many manifestations of the illness look just like common medical complaints). I have probably had it for 20 years, and no one knew.\n\nShocker to discover that I actually WAS sick and fatigued, that things actually WERE harder for me than others. \n\nI'm a week and a half into treatment for the autoimmune illness, and suddenly I feel energetic and well for much more of the day. The heart pounding anxiety has gone down, too. \n\nI'm still seeking treatment for the anxiety, of course, but now so much make sense. ",

One of the sources of this issue is that I am nearing 30 and have not held anything stable beyond a year. I have done a bunch of under-the-table work like cleaning, babysitting, some construction, but nothing illegal. however, I have not held stable income for more than a year. \n\nAnother issue I am having is that nearly every previous job I have worked underwent management changes and lost my information because of it.

            "selftext": "My husband is 35 and normally the happiest, most optimistic person you could ever meet. He has always let things roll off his back for as long as I've known him, over 7 years.\n\nTotally out of the blue, he broke down last week and said that ever since he got a phishing email recently, he's been paranoid that his phone is hacked or someone is trying to steal his identity. I looked at the email and it actually wasn't even a phishing email, so I reassured him and he seemed to be over it.\n\nBut then last night, he broke down crying and confessed that he can't stop worrying about it. He says he knows it's stupid and has no logicial reason to worry, but that he can't stop checking his emails and bank account to make sure nothing weird is going on. But then he started rattling off a list of things he thinks are weird and asking me if I thought they meant anything (like the way his email inbox looks and why he gets certain emails from Google, just all kinds of little things).\n\nSo I just kept reassuring him that everything is okay and that it's good to be vigilant with stuff like that, but that it wasn't good for him to worry so much. And I taught him some coping mechanisms for anxiety since I've suffered from it on and off my entire life (though never had paranoia like this that I remember).\n\nSo I thought maybe he was just stressed and everything would be okay today, but he called me from work a little while ago and asked me why he has certain apps running in the background. Then said that our doorbell camera app was running in the background too, and why is it doing that when he hasn't clicked on it today? He sounded almost panicked. He asked me to check it on my phone to make sure no one is breaking in, and said that the doorbell app being weird made him worry about that now.\n\nSo now I am freaking out wondering what in the world is wrong with him. I have no idea where this is coming from or what could trigger it. I have no idea who to talk to or what to do. For now I just helped him set up some security on his phone, but this seems like a much bigger problem than just that. \n\nOh, and he is not on drugs or any medication. Has never been into any kind of drugs. He drinks a beer or two most nights. That's it.",

I felt like I was alone and I was the only person on the planet that it was happening to. Back then I didn't have a computer or a smart phone to jump on to and find out about it so I just thought I was alone. I finally met someone when I was 19 who got panic attacks too and I felt a weight lifted off of me, don't get me wrong I still got panic attacks but knowing that I wasn't alone was a huge relief. It wasn't until I was 27 that I finally found a friend who not only got panic attacks too but he had a phd in psychology so he could break things down for me. After being turned down by over 50 therapists and trying all sorts of medications I finally got seen by a therapist on my36th birthday. I can honestly say without my friend and my therapist I would have killed myself. I say all of this because I know how horrible it is to go through this alone with no one to talk to and I know how difficult it is for people who don't have this to understand. I want to offer myself to anyone out there who needs someone to listen someone to help for anyone who can't afford a therapist or has no social life. Message me and let's talk if you want we can even talk on the phone. \nTLDR I've had panic attacks and anxiety for close to 20 years I want to help others message me and let me try and help",
