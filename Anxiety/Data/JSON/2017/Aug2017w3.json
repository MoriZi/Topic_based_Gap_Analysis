When in reality you're perfectly capable, it's just the constant negative thoughts stand in the way.

            "selftext": "I see these posts every week about how girls who are anxious are \"the best wives\", how some idiots claim loud and proud they are anxious and that it made then stronger, how some of my family members laugh at others' suffering by saying anxiety is merely a part of life and they eventually snapped out of it. \n\nI hate it.\n\nIt makes me feel like trash for struggling. Makes me feel ashamed for reaching out. Some people I told about my anxiety issues got excited saying that made me super good at organizing things and I always seemed to know where I was going because of this, but the only reason really is that I can never make a move, even a simple social outing, if I don't know who's there, where it is, when is it over, how do I get back, what will happen. I can rarely go to anything because most people don't get it, they think I'm annoying even, to be asking how things will go, saying I should relax and go with the flow. I can't do that!\n\nI hate this glorification! Being anxious does not make me more organized, it makes me petrified! It does not help me at all! It's not \"cool\" or \"edgy\" to be anxious, it's sometimes (most times) a horrible handicap. It does not make me an eventual better wife, it just sucks in a romantic relationship, second guessing every tone change, every wording, every glance and fearing I am not enough or too much, fearing I'm pushing people away but wishing with all my being I could do that because it would mean not having to calculate when I have to call them/give a sign I'm still alive and interested in their life, because I am... but I suck at keeping touch.\n\nBeing told my anxiety is only in my head and I should snap out of it, it hurts. It hurts because it affects me physically too and it's showing, and people don't get that being unable to have energy, being unable to sleep, being unable to enjoy any physical contact are side effects of me hurting so much \"only in my head\" It hurts so much and I wish I could switch it off, forget about it! It's like people confuses stress with anxiety. And I still haven't been to a doctor because I can't even dare to step into my school's nurse office, I run away. My best friend struggles with anxiety too and how come I can motivate her to reach out and support her, but can't take my own advices?\n\nI've tried talking to my famiy about my anxiety issues and I was told I wasn't special and it was normal at my age, that I would grow out of it. I wouldn't dare to talk about it to the family members who would understand, because I feel like such a burden to everyone.\n\nThis is late night ramblings, I've been feeling down and empty recently and so angry at everything at the same time. \n\nI'm sorry. It's simply annoying to have to explain every day that I am anxious and don't know why, and no I can't help biting my nails or tapping my foot, it just happens while I'm so deep into my own head that I get lost in all the things I should be thinking about but can't in fear of having a full panic attack. It's difficult to make people who don't even know what anxiety feels like understand. It's difficult to make people who think they know understand. \n\nMany things going on at the same time, many responsibilities, many changes, and so little focus and composure to accomplish any of it...\n\nWhile people with anxiety can be the most precious and kind and loving individuals in the world, anxiety is not pretty, it's not a likeable trait one should actively seek to develop or find in a partner. Anxiety is something people accept about others. Those who seek anxiety in a partner are likely to look for someone unstable to save or destroy, or both.\n\nDon't like me because I'm anxious, like me because even if I'm anxious, I came to see you, support you and care for you, as friends, family and loved ones should do. \n\nIf only they would stop wearing anxiety like a fashion statement, and thus help the misunderstanding around it die!\n\nI see so many people on this sub struggle and I just want to say that you all are so awesome and strong. My problems are not as dire as yours, I see some of you trying so hard and it inspires me, but it also makes me so angry at the people who just want to look different and edgy and make you all look like your struggles are nothing but a cheap attempt to get attention. \n\nI'll stop now because this is getting more and more incoherent... Again, late night ramblings.... Sorry.\n\nEdit: Wow, thank you for my first gold, kind stranger!",

But I cannot. I get so incredibly anxious thinking about all I have to do, all I haven't done yet, how I still don't know much about doing any of these things (no one ever taught me the first thing about finances)...and I just collapse under the weight of it all. I freeze, and I just don't do any of the things I'm supposed to do. I lay there and obsess about what I need to do for hours and hours, but I don't do anything about it. Then I lie about why I can't get anything done, because \"anxiety\" is not an acceptable answer. It pisses everyone off and ruins my life. \n\nI flew to my father's house this week because this half of my family is disappointed that I do not see them often enough (because I don't get time off at work). The whole time I am forced to babysit my much younger siblings and get grilled for not making enough money and living up to the expectations of a normal fucking adult. Then my mother's side got angry that I don't see THEM often enough, so I'm traveling there next week. Amidst all this, I realized that I forgot completely about my volunteering commitment to a local hospital. Volunteering that I need to get into the school program that will hopefully give me a real career, since mentally fucked me fucked up college the first time around. This is not the first time I've forgotten volunteering because of anxious obsessions about other facets of my life. Needless to say, they are sick of me being unreliable and will not be asking me back. Then my coworkers complained about me not getting enough done at work. I can't please family, friends, work, anyone. My life always implodes because I can't be a fucking functional adult. \n\nHow the hell does anyone do it? How especially do mentally ill people do it?

            "selftext": "Hi guys,\n\nThought this might be a good place to share this! Because of my anxiety and depression I fucked up real bad this year in uni. Failed all of my Winter sem courses and even one in the Fall term. I've been so embarrassed to talk about this to anyone because I feel like such a failure. Since coming home from school in April I've been DREADING dealing with the consequences of all this. Although I had my appeal (aka document outlining my struggles/extenuating circumstances that caused me to fail these courses and why I would like them basically removed from my transcript) ready since April I haven't been able to send it in. Every time I would log on to do it I would read over my appeal letter, criticize tf out of it, and close my browser. I would try to send it I would simply freak out and ended up getting nothing accomplished. It's been four months now since I've been trying to do this and I finally hit that send button today!!!!\n\nBasically, the point of this post is for anyone who's anxiety is keeping them from doing something they absolutely NEED to get done (or you'll be straight up screwed like me) but can't seem to find the courage to do it. Finding that bravery will make a world of difference for your anxious thoughts. Trust me. I don't think I've been this happy in years! ",

It's all about Mindfulness/awareness/Living in the moment, that's the answer. Why do we get anxious at times? Because of our thoughts - thoughts that only exists in our mind. It's almost impossible to be anxious while you're living in the moment without thinking about the past or the future. Each time you catch yourself thinking/daydreaming just be aware of it and go back to the present and you'll see what a huge difference this makes. I'm not keeping my mind busy to forget about things, i'm doing my best to keep my mind quiet. At night before I go to sleep, I focus on nothing and I have been sleeping a lot better and I am no longer dealing with morning anxiety, why? Because I am not focusing on any thought, I'm letting thoughts come and go. \nThis is seriously as easy as it sounds, try it. For a few hours just let thoughts come and go and just be \"aware\" of that precise moment. \nBefore when I used to practice this I always gave up because I thought I was supposed to not think of anything but the key is to just be aware that you're thinking, control the thoughts, don't allow them to control you.",

            "selftext": "tl;dr I go through good periods and bad periods and during good periods, I hate myself for being anxious and think it's my fault that I got anxious \n\nMy anxiety seems to sort of go through cycles. It's not like I'm bipolar or something--the lows aren't quite as low as flat out depression and the highs aren't as high as mania. Plus the cycles seem to be mostly triggered by things that happen to me, even if I don't always know what caused the change at the time. \n\nAnyway, basically sometimes for a few weeks or whatever I'm pretty anxious and I just feel like everybody thinks I'm uncool, nobody wants me around, I'm dumb and lazy, and I wonder why anybody is even friends with me to begin with since I'm such a fuck up and I get scared that my dad will stop loving me and that my friends will leave me. While the anxiety during these periods is mostly related to my self worth and interactions with other people, not all of it is. I oftentimes during these periods feel myself questioning and checking every decision that I make. \n\nThen, for whatever reason, I score a win somehow or somebody compliments me and I start to feel that things are looking up. Sometimes if I'm really into whatever project I'm working on then, I get a kind of giddy, optimistic feeling and just feel like everything is going to be alright.\n\nBut anyway, during the happy periods, I look back on my sad periods and think about how I thought about myself and realize that A. It's totally irrational, I make mistakes but realistically I am not the world's biggest fuckup. I have a lot of things to be proud of and I'm just letting my mood/worldview taint my perception of myself and how I think other people see me and B. It doesn't matter that much what other people think of me and I know I have inherent self worth and that there are things I can be happy about, regardless of whether cool people see it that way. When I start to feel better, I feel guilty about feeling anxious and insecure earlier. I hate myself for letting this silly negative worldview get to me and waste my time and cause me to waste my potential. I hate myself for getting caught up in thoughts, problems that aren't even real, and I feel like it's my fault those thoughts stayed with me for as long as they did because I didn't have enough willpower and foresight to just block them out and not let them get to me. I feel like the reason the negative thoughts were able to appear and take control is my laziness and lack of hard work to keep them out. \n\nDoes anyone else ever experience this? How do you deal with it? I know I won't be happy all the time; things happen and some level of insecurity is normal. But how do I keep the negative worldview from taking over my thoughts? How do I keep myself from being overwhelmed by these thoughts. Does anyone have any useful tips on how to recognize negative self talk and change it to be more optimistic, or at least not as hyperbolic? \n\nI think sometimes I let negative thoughts persist because in a way it's easier and more comfortable to just stay sad. That way you have a bit of control over your sadness. If you start to feel something like \"Everybody else is cooler and smarter than I am\" but then you tell yourself \"No that's not true\" but then you go out and do something that day that validates the negative theory, you feel even more like shit and you didn't see it coming. \n\nSorry for rambling. Anyway if anybody has any thoughts about this they'd like to share, comment them below. ",
