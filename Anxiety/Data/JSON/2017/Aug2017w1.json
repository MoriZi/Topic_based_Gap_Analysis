            "selftext": "First of all, I wanted to thank anyone who replied to a post I made last week about going through a crisis and several panic attacks. Those replies were so helpful and I am so grateful to those that reached out and helped me.\n\nI also wanted to preface by saying I have never taken any anti-anxiety medication or any anti-depressants in my life before yesterday.\n\nMy anxiety has been really, really bad this past week. I haven't been able to sleep or eat, and can barely function. I wasn't able to go into work, and I'm going to have to make some pretty big life decisions in the near future that I did not feel at all ready to make.\n\nYesterday I woke up and it's the worst I've ever felt. I couldn't even sit still and barely felt aware. My body felt like it was going to implode and there was nothing I could do about it. I wanted to cry so badly but couldn't even do that and it honestly felt like I was starting to lose it, like for real. My SO told me it was time to get some emergency help. So he took me to the ER.\n\nI was there for hours, and ERs give me a panic attack on their own by just being there. After multiple hours of waiting and talking to several nurses and a doctor, they gave me some Ativan on the spot, a prescription for Xanax and Zofran, and sent me on my way. I made it clear to them that I needed emergency medication and they listened.\n\n**30 minutes or so after taking the Ativan, I felt like a whole new person.** The negative voice in my head went away, my body calmed down, and I could finally breathe. No more brain fog, no more crazy heartbeats, no shaking. It was all gone. I felt so much relief that all I could do on the car ride home was just laugh (not in a creepy way, at least I don't think ;) ) because it felt like such a massive weight was lifted off of my chest.\n\nNow even 24 hours later I've been able to sleep and eat on my own without a need for medication. The Ativan has obviously worn off by now, but it's like it snapped my body out of the panic. I haven't had another panic attack, and I've been able to smile and laugh, even in the face of an unknown and pretty scary future. I was even able to take my first ever dose of Celexa an hour ago without freaking out. I've had no desire to take any Xanax either. One of the best parts is that I'm not numb; I can think about these life changes rationally and though I'm still scared and nervous about them, I know no matter what happens I will be okay.\n\nI wanted to post this for a few reasons. Mainly, if there is anyone else out there who is going through something similar to me, please go and get help. In a span of 48 hours I went from feeling so helpless and the worst I have ever felt, to honestly the best I have felt in a long, long time. There is no shame in going to the ER for anxiety if you need to and all of my doctors were so understanding and sweet.\n\nEven while typing this right now, I feel so zen and at peace. I can't honestly tell you the last time I ever felt like this.",

But when i do all of these and finally sit on my couch, put on a tv show or a movie, suddenly and slowly I feel something is coming up inside me. Suddenly i become heavy, tired, I feel a sensation of sadness is settling in slowly, and when i notice these sensations my hands get fidgety, stomach get upset(i had some episodes of ibs in the past) so instead of focusing on a book or a movie i focus on those sensations and can't enjoy anything, so i pause the movie and go for a smoke, it eases down the symptoms a bit but they come back 10 -15 mins later.

No setbacks or anything.  So we drove up in the afternoon and everything went well, we even got to their camp and I was surprising my sell with how well I had been doing. My anxiety was always on my mind, but we played some card games, went to McDonalds and even had a few beer. It started getting late and we were finishing up our last card game when almost out of nowhere I started to feel anxious, and it continued to get worst, almost to the point where I had to walk outside and leave the game. Fortunately I stayed until we finished cards and then everyone went to bed. We had our own little cabin me my wife and dog. We went in and my wife and dog fell asleep. I started to feel more and more anxious, thinking of things like I'm an hour from home, I'm in the woods, we don't have a bathroom, what if I have a panic attack here. Then it started to downpour and that up my anxiety for whatever reason. Also, the next morning we were all supposed to go to church and then hang out in the afternoon. That also made me very anxious knowing I wouldn't be going home for a long time. All this build up to the point where I woke my wife up around 3 in the morning and told her we had to leave. We drove and hour in the rain to get home. Obviously once I was home I was fine.  But this has bothered me all day, and has made my wife very upset. Not at me but the fact we had to lie to our friends and the fact that she feels that she can't help me when I'm feeling like this.  I'm proud that I made it to the camp, but disappointed that I had to leave. Some days you think you have a grip on your anxiety and other days you feel like your back at the start. Thanks for listening, guys! ",

I haven't really left my room in 3 weeks and have major issues involving my self-image and how I look, so bad I have not been able to hold down a job for any real length of time, I can barely face my own family never mind strangers and always feel exposed and anxious in public, waiting for others to judge and ridicule me.\n\nIts slowly killing me at the moment, now theres some self harm involved, I have zero friends, no kids, not married/no girlfriend nothing. Full stop. \n\nI also know i'll never have those things in the future either. In fact the only person keeping me breathing is my mother, as sad as it sounds for a 28 year old man. ",

I do like the time I spend with my SO, my friends, my family, but it never feels like enough.  It always feels like something's missing, like it isn't as good as those times in the past.\n\nThe stupid part is I've felt this way for years and then I always end up looking back on the times I thought were meh as good times.  I thought today was boring and uneventful but there's a good chance I'll be looking back on it this time next year wishing things were this good.  \n\nI guess it's hard to tell what days will be memorable until you're looking back on them.  There's no way to tell one certain day is going to be super significant in hindsight and stand out to you.  I want things to feel special *now* though.  I want every day to feel super wonderful and memorable and special.  \n\nIt really really sucks being caught in this cycle.  I spend so much time obsessing about the past that I can't enjoy the present\u2026or maybe I spend so much time obsessing BECAUSE I can't enjoy the present?  I don't know, point is I wish I could just take things day by day happily instead of being stuck in the past :/\n\nAnyone else with this problem or am I alone?\n\n",

It's so very easy to say we're not going somewhere to doing something or trying something new because we know that our anxiety will fill us with dread along the way. \n\nDo you guys ever push yourself to get through it? I truly believe this is the strongest way to kick anxietys ass. \n\nJust recently, I had an opportunity to go to my girlfriends cottage about 2 hours away. I skipped out on the experience because I knew I would have a panic attack in the car with her and her family (road trips are one of my triggers). Well, she was up there for a few days and her father drove up the second day. I forced myself to go and push through my anxiety because it's what felt right. I brought things to occupy myself with to evade my anxiety. \n\nMy point is, I went to the cottage, and I had an absolute blast. Easily the best memory I've made this summer, and I almost passed it up because this darkness in my mind was controlling me. I beg you all to find the strength to get through your struggles. I know we all have anxiety to a different extent, but we're all here experiencing everything together. \n\nThank you to such an awesome sub who's shown me that I'm not alone with all of this, and who's shown me so many ways to deal with this. You guys rock. \n\nHere's to kicking anxietys ass!",

            "selftext": "I just woke up from one.  I can't stop looking around my apartment to see if they are still here.  I'm crying.  I'm shaking.\n\nThese outrageously vivid nightmares started about ten days ago.  I've had only one per night, but they are much longer and more vivid than any dreams I've ever had before.  I've had more nightmares in this 10 day period than I have in my entire life.  Each one is scarier than the previous nightmare.  They each have a consistent story and flow, but none of them have any relevance to my daily life, what I've seen on TV, etc.\n\nEach of these nightmares also occurs immediately before I wake up.  I feel that it is the fear that wakes me up.  If I didn't wake up, the nightmares would be even longer.\n\nIs there any way that I can stop this?  If it continues for much longer I don't think I'll be able to fall asleep anymore.  Suicide would be the inevitable result.\n\nPlease, please, please help me!!!  This is torture.\n\nNote:  I am willing to tell you all the content of these dreams.  I just didn't want to lengthen my post and drive people away who could be helpful.\n\nEdit:\n\nu/bluescrubs33 has potentially and most likely helped me solve this issue!  I purchased the same melatonin supplements I have been taking since late May/early June but didn't realize that I was taking 5 times the dose I had been taking previously (jumping from 2mg to 10mg).  They were the only supplements available, same packaging and color, etc., and were in the same location as they normally were and for the same price.  I'm hoping that tonight will be nightmare-free.  I will update you all tomorrow!",
