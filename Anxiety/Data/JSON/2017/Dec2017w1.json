I have so far downloaded most of their albums and singles from a career of over 20 years, so it's a lot to put it simply. Besides that I have a folder with nearly 80gb of videos and pictures of one of the singers. \n\nIts hard to keep up with news about them since I don't speak the language, and I'm always on a state of nerves to keep myself updated, trying to find streams or downloads of the latest TV appearances,etc. I browse a forum for the singer in their language, and for some reason whenever I see a new post I get all anxious, I immediately past it on google translate only to read gibberish. \n\nRecently I came across an exhaustive list of all of their songs. Some of those I just can't find, and I'm getting really anxious about it. Just now I was trying to find them, and I got so worked up over it that I'm still having a little bit of pain on my chest, and my eyelid won't stop twitching. The fact that I'll probably never listen to those makes me so anxious.\n\nI hate to be like this, this takes away all of enjoyment I get from listening to them, watching videos,etc. I hate this. ",

This is one of my biggest triggers. Not because of pain, pain I can do. Because of the freezing making my tongue numb and the feeling I'm choking. The last time I went to the dentist I had to bolt and reschedule because I just couldn't get through the procedure. \n\nThis time I did it. I thought about going to my physician for a mild sedative, but as it came closer to the date, I just repeated to myself that I'd be okay, and I just had to get it done.\n\nFinally, that day came last thursday, and right before, after they did the freezing, I thought I was going to have to bolt again, but I just took a 5 minute break and came back, and they did the procedure. Now, I'm not going to say it didn't feel weird or it didn't hurt. My jaw still hurts from it a week later.\n\n*But I did it!*\n\n ",

If people treat me nicely, I tell myself I *don't* deserve it, and assume there must be some kind of malicious intent behind it or that they're just too polite to tell me I annoy them. I've recently become friends with a guy who's really nice, but him being so kind to me has caused me to worry that he's constantly mocking me behind my back, and secretly thinks I'm a complete idiot.\n\nI become scared when people talk to me, but I also get depressed when no one does.\n\nI wish socialising wasn't such a major part of life.",

What will I do after my parents die? How will I live? What scares me the most is the fact that after they are gone, I'll never see them again. I can never talk to them again, tell them about my problems, tell them that I love them. They've done so much for me, and the thought of them being gone brings me to tears every time.
