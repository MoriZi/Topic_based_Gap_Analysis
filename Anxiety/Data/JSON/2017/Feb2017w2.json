And then the best thing in the world happened. \n\nI lost my last credit card and I know that's not a big deal but when I realized it tonight, I could feel the panic starting again. It's because of this panic and fear of legitimately killing myself,  I finally built up the courage to fully open up to my parents. And they were exactly how I expected. Completely supportive and caring. \n\nThey're willing to help me and that just feels nice. So I thought I'd share because I'm just overwhelmed with what the future can hold.

I was skeptical at first, but hot damn if I don't feel like I can be myself for the first time ever. \n\n\nOf course I still have flare ups, but it is nothing like the almost daily panic attacks I had been dealing with. As a bonus, I had the courage to ask a guy out!

I don't have to tell it can be very dangerous to do this. I'm on Prozac, the minimum dosage of Adderall, and a blood pressure medication with a long technical name I forgot but whose bottle is in the other room and would mean I would have to remove my dog who fell asleep on my lap.

And I find myself repeatedly thinking throughout the day something like, \"I have so much anxiety\" or \"I have really bad anxiety\" etc. \n\nThis probably creates more anxiety because I'm always thinking about it and I don't know why I can't just not think about it, you know.

When I have a panic attack I don't want to call it that because I've heard that some people have panic attacks so severe they have to go to the hospital.  If I feel afraid of talking to somebody, or going somewhere/doing something I feel guilty because some people are so anxious they literally can't leave their house or hold any sort of conversation.  I'll look at lists of symptoms for anxiety and if I fail to meet even one of them I'll feel so guilty because I'm just faking it.  Since there are people out there whose anxiety is more \"debilitating\" or severe I feel extremely guilty to say I have anxiety, or to ask for help.\n\nEven when I come on forums like these, I feel guilty because I am pretending to have anxiety and seeking resources for those with anxiety, which may be offensive or something.  Except that I *do* actually have anxiety, just as much as any of you.  Does anyone else feel this way?",

Since then, although I still feel a bit anxious, I am able to do things I never thought I'd be able to do (go food shopping etc.) and I've also been a lot happier. \n\nMy boyfriend, though he says he notices a big improvement, still finds my anxiety too much. Last night we were talking and he told me 'anxiety isn't an attractive quality. I wish you were more confident. You're going to get walked all over in life'. Today he broke up with me. \n\nI don't blame him for not wanting to be with someone like me, and I know that my anxiety has put him through a lot too. However, it doesn't help the pain I'm feeling. \n\nI don't know why I'm really posting this to be honest. I just needed to get this off my chest...\n\nThank you for reading this &lt;3 ",

Walking feels aimless when all you\u2019re trying to do is to keep your knees from giving in to the inevitable collapse. Just a few more steps, you\u2019ll say. Just a few more steps. Count to 10. Things seem simpler when you count to 10. Count again. \n\n**Anxiety.** \n\nIt chases you wherever you go, tasing every thought that dares to enter your mind. Injects you with so much inner paranoia that even your own self-conscious becomes another voice you can\u2019t trust. \n\n---\nThey often come hand in hand, and they create a classical symphony that sounds something along the lines of:\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t do this. You\u2019re wasting your time. You\u2019re wasting everyone\u2019s time. You know you\u2019re undeserving of everything you have; body mind and soul. All you ever do is cry. He\u2019ll leave you. Your mother will kick you out. Your dad is disappointed in you. Your baby sister is watching you, either setting herself up to follow in your miserable footsteps or reading you as the cautionary tale that you are. And you can\u2019t even decide which one would be worse, now can you. You have no ambition. Nothing to get you out of bed in the morning. You\u2019ve failed at finding something to fail at. You\u2019re alive. No one asked you if you wanted to be but here you are anyway, and now you\u2019re left to deal with the shit that comes with it and no one understands, not your friends nor your parents your sisters your pets and all you ever do is cry, all you ever fucking do is weep. You're depressed about being depressed about being depressed about your crippling anxiety that kneads your soul from the inside out, from the outside in, from outside the walls of your barely-beating heart sending signals to your brain saying 'I need you to help me beat on', getting signals back saying 'I don\u2019t care if you never beat again'\u2026\u201d \n\nTwo peas in a fucking pod, those two. They play all day, tossing your sanity over your head from side to side. And I know you\u2019re losing more and more of your energy with every passing day to jump up and catch it mid air.",

            "selftext": "I'm a 26 year old Asian male, quiet, enjoy my time in front of the computer, going to the gym, spending time with my girlfriend.\n\nHave started seeing a therapist for my general anxiety (fears of failure, disappointment, embarassment) but have come to realise recently that I also get anxious at social situations, especially if I have to meet new people that are not necessarily 'my crowd'. A lot of the time this makes my crawl back into my shell because I'm scared of being judged. Due to this, I've been told that some people think I'm snobby and what not, which I definitely don't want to be.\n\nWhen I do end up in social situations, I find it difficult conversing with other groups of people because a lot of the time I'll be quiet and somewhat uninterested in what they talk about (e.g. different sports or parties or just talking smack). I get scared if I get invited to these things and wind up not going because I think I'll just be awkward (A lot of the time I find it hard to keep eye contact because I'm shy and feel intimidated). After the salutations and introductions, I find it hard to talk about much. \n\nOften I'll go into panic mode and feel my heart rate shoot up just thinking about these situations without me actually being there. Does anyone else have a similar feeling? Should I try and find social groups that cater more to my personality? ",

Look around you\n2. Find 5 things you can see\n3. Find 4 things you can touch\n4. Find 3 things you can hear\n5. Find two things you can smell\n6.
