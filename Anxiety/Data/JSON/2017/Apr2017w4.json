I seriously can't go a single day without this happening. 50/50 chance no one is rude as long as I don't say a single thing at school that day. Even then there are always people who find my quietness to be just as inviting to insults as me conversing with them. Everyday people walk over me since i'm so small and frail looking (HS aged male, skinny as shit, and most likely the palest person you've ever seen excluding someone with albinism.) People commenting on how pale and skinny I am every other conversation chips away my self esteem. My anxiety is already pretty crippling but with such little self esteem these insults hurt like a brick being smashed into my heart. The best I feel at school is when I'm alone in the bathroom. No one can look at me then. I'm not sure how I function/will continue to. \n\nI also understand a lot of high schoolers are assholes but it's extremely hard to ignore. Today on the bus some girl started waving at me. Ignored her because my anxiety was telling me \"she isn't waving at you, don't look at her and make a fool of yourself\". Well I hear her through my headphones and calls me a pale ass motherfucker... Like shit man, you think I want to try and break out of my anxiety when the fear of that is always in my mind?\n\nAny advice? (excluding getting some color in my skin/gaining weight because I most definitely will be doing that).\n\n*I hate to sound like a baby but I'm getting sick of living like this everyday. I'd prefer being dead over continuing my life like this.  \n\nedit: thank you all for the advice. I've read all of your comments and appreciate it truly. I'd reply to each of you but I'd rather not spam the post with tons of comments. Thanks so much :)",

Funny thing is im good in Math but on almost every Math test .. I blank out or make the smallest mistakes for no reason despite studying (This doesn't happen in any other courses except for Math which I find weird). For studying I like to stay in the comfort of my home but I can get distracted by other people and that affects my focus so I usually have to wait until it's night time for any quiet/peace. \n\nBecause of this, I have failed my college Math course (Which I will be retaking next semester). \n\nI feel depressed about this and especially the Math exam that i failed greatly. \n\nAnyone deal with this kind of issue?.",

Why does it matter that I don't pay attention... that's who I am... why do I get mad at myself for being me?...\n\nBOOM ANXIETY ATTACK\n\npop off the headphones and race outside to go on a walk. \n\nPanic attack lasted about 10 minutes but the whole time I could only think one thought, Why do I get mad at myself for being me?\n\nThen it hit me. That's just what I've grown up doing... but I can change it. And then...\n\nBOOM PANIC ATTACK ENDS\n\nNow I have set a goal. To be me. To be happy.

            "selftext": "Throwaway because my brother knows my account name.\nBasically, ive always had pretty bad anxiety as a kid, and I was diagnosed adhd when i was 14.  I should add that I had/have a prescription for dex amphetamine and ritalin. \n\nWhen I was a kid I usually had anxiety about things that could actually happen. \n\nnow its things like being terrified about terrorists invading my country that is two continents away and stuff like obsessive thoughts that if the terrorists saw tht i was circumcised Or not i would get murdered.\n\nWhen i was 14 i smoked weed, it gave me dp/dr symptoms, but I didnt care and took a break of 5 months. I think this might have triggered an underlying anxiety thing in me, or at least worsened it.\n\nThan I smoked and still felt a little weird when not stoned, like not being able to close my eyes for longer then 5 seconds because of flashes. There were a few more but I forgot.\n\nI started smoking atleast once a week, commonly with some friends. We used to go through upto 4 or 5 grams in one day, usually across 2 or 3 people. \n\nI started feeling a bit weird once because I needed to take an extra 5mgs of ritalin in my prescription. I felt like a zombie and someone said t might've been dp dr. \n\n\nSo my anxiety mind goes full research and scares itself alot, and becomes even more paranoid. This also led to increased anxiety when smoking.\n\nI still smoked every now and then and all seemed fine. Untill I went full research again and decided that with my anxiety I shouldn't be smoking.\n\nI decided to take a break from weed for a while, which lasted 1 week total. I smoked a gram I think, spread out in 1 hour. I took maybe 0.1 gram with me home because I got it from a friend, So that was what happened last week. \n\nSo 4/20 comes along and I decided to roll 1 mid sized joint/ spliff which was propably the best joint I ever rolled. It was a 1 part weed plus some stems 5 parts loose tobacco.\n\nSo I got a little stoned on that day, mostly nicotine headrush but it was fun. The next day I take my usual 7.5 mg amphetamine prescription in the morning to help with my adhd. I also found 5 mg more amph and My prescription also says to have another 7.5 mgs in the middle of the day, arround 3.\n\nSo i had 12.5 mg amph and I took it at 4 in the middle of the day. An hour later I felt a little bit of effects, but then I feel my depersonalization playing up, weird head pressure and reduced hearing were my most common symptoms. \n\nThis gives some anxiety but it was fine, definetely not something to worry about too much. I spent the entire evening researching some stuff I was hyperfocused on. \n\nI staye up in bed till it was 2.30 in the morning, basically on my phone. i wook up 4 hours later at 7, the weird head pressure and dp dr still there. Its 6 noon now and its still here. \n\nI dont take my meds in the weekends so maybe its just a comedown? I usually dont get these but i took 5mgs more yesterday so maybe thats it, I just had a small anxiety attack about this.\n\nIm gonna tell my parents about my drug use. I have a problem, because I know the drugs worsen my anxiety, but I cant stop for longer than a month. I used to be deprressed a year ago, and Thats kinda gone but now Im numb.\n\n\nPlease help, is this just a comedown?\n\n\n\n\n",

            "selftext": "If I eat in a social setting, I dread not being able to finish my food. Throughout childhood I was a fussy eater (not really anymore) with a weak appetite. I would be forced to sit at the table by my mother, sometimes for up to an hour, until she gave up. She'd always be very angry about it. Some things I just could not stomach at all. For some reason I've always had a huge aversion to the dreaded baked potato.\n\nI'm still sort of weird about it. I get so anxious at meal times that I often shake uncontrollably, but it happens in specific instances. It usually happens when I bring a drink to my mouth - my head tends to shake. I have no idea why.\n\nI've had so many criticisms for it in the past, which I think is in part due to my skinny stature. People will always remark that I can't afford to not eat.\n\nThis thought gives me anxiety, and completely kills my appetite. Sometimes I can't eat more than a single mouthful. What usually happens is, despite feeling that I am not full, and that I could stomach more food, I physically can't make myself swallow it. I can swallow fluids just fine (assuming I can bring the glass to my mouth), but I can't make myself gulp the food down.\n\nThis bizarre mindset has made me deathly afraid of going out anywhere if I think food might be involved, which these days, it always fucking is.\n\nHowever, even at home, alone, I often get this issue. It's not that I feel full, it's that I can't get myself to swallow. I've used cannabis before to stimulate my appetite and I have to say that it works wonders, to the point I've been able to eat two full portions quite happily. However, I believe that it makes it even harder for me to eat when I'm not using it. I've also quit it for other reasons.\n\nWhat can I do to get over this problem? I want to be able to eat properly.\n",

I used to think it started with my specialty, which is one of the high risk surgical fields. I thought it grew into me with my training. Eventually I sought out treatment. I saw a psychiatrist and I was put on Lexapro which worked well for the anxiety and depression.\n\nUnfortunately Lexapro made me very dizzy and I never got over it, so I was on Cymbalta for a year or two which seemed much better. I still suffered from extreme fatigue, brain fog, memory problems, and thirst. I attributed this to working extremely long hours, family and personal stress - and even the side effects of the Cymbalta.\n\nI checked my thyroid, which was normal. I checked my calcium and it was slightly high. For a year we followed my calcium and PTH (parathyroid hormone) levels and they were raised. After two years of messing around, I was diagnosed with a parathyroid adenoma in my neck. It's a benign tumor that raises the calcium in your blood and causes a lot of side effects, including anxiety. My anxiety was poorly controlled even on Cymbalta and seemed to be breaking through even on higher doses.\n\nThe adenoma is out and I'm already on half dose Cymbalta (30mg). My symptoms have lifted like a cloud lifting off the ground. Even though baseline bloods were done on me before I started medication, always remember to rule of medical causes of anxiety like thyroid, parathyroid or medications. It's changed my life.",
