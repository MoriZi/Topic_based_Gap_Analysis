Despite the words coming out of his mouth, he doesn't have a giant dashboard of buttons he can shoot missiles out of. Stop watching so many movies.\n\n2. War is costly. Nobody wants it, and all the tough talk is just a big pissing contest. North Korea would lose hard despite their big words.\n\n3. Civilian deaths are a big no-no for everyone, civilians' voices matter too, especially since many have international business relations.\n\n4. Despite what the media and the commenters on r/worldnews say, North Korea sucks at launching missiles as a whole. They have failed to target multiple times.\n\n5. Look to the past. North Korea has previously threatened both Guam and Hawaii, and is no stranger to threats. Worse situations have happened in the past. Just to list a few: the Cuban Missile Crisis, the Cold War, etc. And yet we are all still here. While the situation isn't a good thing, you and your friends will be fine.

I just want to be normal.  And sometimes I think I could be normal if I just tried harder.\n\nI've been diagnosed with major depressive disorder and generalized anxiety disorder with a touch of OCD.  What if these are just fake made up names for people who are too weak to handle life?  \n\nThere's no one in my life that makes me feel this way, everyone is supportive.  It's just me.

I see the school psychologist every two weeks/every week and he helps a lot, but it's not enough. He's a real therapist with a PhD and years of experience, but he is part of the school after all and a free service. \n\nI have tried to get my parents to understand. I've had the school psychologists talk to them but they refuse to listen. They think it's all a load of garbage and they also think I exaggerate things to the psychologist and am essentially a weak person who \"can't get their shit together\". I don't think they could even begin to understand what my anxiety is like. I'm pretty sure I have OCD, and I used to have obsessions that weren't really grounded in reality. Now my obsessions are based off of things that anybody would find anxiety inducing, they're just crippling and much more intense than they are for most. Sometimes I lie in bed, unable to eat, unable to function, because the anxiety about something in my life is crippling. I haven't felt like this in months, until today. I'm not sure why everything is piling up and becoming unbearable. Maybe it's because school is starting soon and a lot of stressful things are coming my way. I talked to my therapist yesterday (by sneaking out of the house and going to the school) and I still feel like shit. Since I have OCD and often seek reassurance, he usually tries to expose me to my fears, just a little bit. Well, as of right now, I feel like the world is collapsing and if I try to eat anything I'll throw it back up and my stomach hurts incredibly. I'm supposed to go to work soon but I really don't want to. ",

My mum constantly mocked me for how I looked and sounded, and overall she and my sister made me sweep my problems under the rug and tried to force me to \"snap out\" of them. I kept hoping they were right and I'd eventually get better miraculously, but it never happened and now I'm fucked. They pretend like they understand and keep telling me to reach out to them for help, but I know exactly how reaching out to them will go over.

I'm 36 and in order to pull this off, I have to live 1200 miles away from my husband, cats, and the house we bought together. We've been preparing emotionally for this since February. We have a very close relationship and are going into it with our eyes open so please nobody remind me of how hard this will be because I'm absolutely aware. \n\nI suffer from many forms of anxiety, equal parts social and generalized. I fear the unknown. I also have borderline personality disorder and have worked for years in therapy to get myself to a mental state where I could do grad school. And here I am. Being a borderline means I get massive separation anxiety when my loved ones are out of reach.\n\nThis will be the hardest thing I've ever done in my life and no matter what happens, I'm determined to finish.\n\nI envy other graduate students who don't feel crippling anxiety about what's to come or ask themselves a million what-ifs. I envy other people who can just go and do things without analyzing, overanalyzing, and reanalyzing. I envy those who can sleep the night before big events. \n\nI also miss my husband. He flew home today from helping me move. I cried the whole way home from the airport. I know I won't sleep until I know he's back in our house safely. Dealing with not seeing him everyday is going to take immense will.\n\nI feel like I'm overburdening my friends by telling them how scared I am. I feel like a broken record. So I'm coming here. I'm telling you that I'm scared, but I'm doing it anyway.",

This has been amazing to reach this point and although I am not 100% back I am having more and more moments, however brief, where I literally feel my old self in the driver seat with minimal anxiety and a clear mind (essentially how I felt before my anxiety disorder developed). I ask that none of you give up. I went from full agoraphobic to holding a job for the last year. Panic attacks all day and night for years but please never give up because it is possible to come through it all. I'll finish up by adding that you may read this and feel 100% there is no way this will ease up or get better but I am here to tell you I would have swore to you 4 years ago this is relentless and will never relent (exactly what you may be feeling or thinking).

They\u2019re on the topic about North Korea and their threats and it boggles me that they joke around this much about the possibility of a war, making remarks such as, \u201cwe\u2019re all gonna die.\u201d Then the audience laughs their asses off, it really fucks me up.\n\nAll this anxiety is making me unmotivated to do anything I like, knowing that I\u2019ll think about nuclear war, even though war has nothing to do with the activity I\u2019m doing. I\u2019m a sophomore in high school so I\u2019ve never really experienced anything like this before. I know I can\u2019t do anything about it, it\u2019s not in my control, but I just want answers, are we fucked?\n",

My siblings and I always had to ask our mom what's okay to say/not to say, how to respond to xyz. This was because she didn't want our dad to know anything. If we slipped up, we were punished badly to say the least. That eventually effected my writing. I struggle to write academic papers because I need constant approval. I need to make sure I am on the right track. I am slowly breaking out of it. I ask my husband after I finish a page to see if it's good. \n\nThe problem now is my speech. I broke out of stumbling across words pretty young. The only thing is I rehearse what I have to say to make sure I don't sound dumb. But now I'm just a mess. I mispronounce things or use the wrong words (in both English and Spanish). I say incomplete sentences or say random gibberish. My accent is also coming out. I am constantly thinking about *not* mispronouncing things and I end up doing it! I don't know what to do. I don't feel comfortable talking to my husband or sister anymore. They always tell me to shake it off it's okay. But I feel like I can't. ",

I've always had issues maintaining a placement longer than a year because of my anxiety.\n\n2 years ago I went through a stage of not being able to find work very easily. So I signed with my local job agency. I was being put on placements between 4-12 weeks typically, doing things I'd NEVER considered before. Things like factory work, restaurant work etc. But when you know it's only 4 weeks long you just think \"oh what the hell\" if you're worried about what people might think of you then you can say it's just a temporary thing, if you're anxious about making a dick of yourself, you're only there for a few weeks. Etc.\n\nWith job agencies you will always have the opportunity to say no to any placement you could never do, mine was cleaning. \n\nAnyway, at 21 my confidence is through the roof, I have worked in night clubs in London, working on lights and sound systems and assisting DJ's, I have worked debt collection & estate agents administration. There's plenty more I have done. But these are examples of how easy it is to get thrown into the deep end by your agency. \n\nThe first job or two might be worrying, but I promise if you stick with working this way you'll learn so much, gain confidence speaking to all kinds of people and you'll feel accomplished in general, eventually being able to talk with knowledge in just about any subject.
