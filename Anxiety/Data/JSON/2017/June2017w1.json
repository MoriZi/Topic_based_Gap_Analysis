There is nothing within me that agrees when someone says something nice about me, or appreciates me for all the good and courageous things I say or do. It just feels fake and simply not true at all.

            "selftext": "I have been a fairly frequent visitor to this sub over the last couple of years. I have a pretty typical story, I was a high achiever who worked myself almost to death throughout university and started experiencing horrible anxiety. I started to obsess over the thought of making a mistake (e.g. forgetting to reference something in an essay) and immediately jump to being expelled, my career down the drain before it even began.\n\nIt sounds a bit trivial now but in my worst I was an absolute basket case. I'd lie in my bed crying thinking how pointless it all was. I thought all my friends hated me. In social situations I was trapped in a cycle of drinking to make myself relax, then waking up feeling anxious &amp; mortified about my drinking. I even had to call a suicide support line once.\n\nFast forward to recent times and a new and stressful job made me really evaluate things. I'd been prescribed Esitalo before but never took it as I thought it was 'weak' and that I was not 'really' mentally ill I was just overdramatic.\n\nI finally made two decisions: I was giving up drinking and I was going on medication. \n\nBoth have made *such* a difference. My recent achievements include keeping my house tidy, sleeping eight hours overnight, and cooking dinner every night. I know these things probably sound tiny, but they're things I haven't done consistently in over three years.\n\nPlus, I feel I have so much more perspective. I made a mistake at work recently, and instead of it turning me into a catatonic mess convinced I'd be fired, I was able to think of a solution, explain the situation to my boss, and move on.\n\nHonestly, it had been so long since I was anxiety free I think I'd forgotten what it feels like to have a clear head and some damn perspective! Going on medication has really made me realise that there was something seriously physiological going on - the way I was feeling was *not* normal or 'just a bit stressed'. I still feel a bit stressed on occasion, but not the crazy wild panic and terror I'd feel before.\n\nI'm not planning to be on medication forever, as I think with the combination of my new healthy habits (especially quitting drinking almost totally), I will be able to be medication free really soon. But I just wanted to post this in case anyone else is struggling with the stigma and embarrassment that I did - if your trusted GP/psych thinks this is an option for you, please don't be embarrassed. It's just one tool to help you get on top of this crappyness we call anxiety!",

            "selftext": "I always make so many negative posts about my anxiety and depression but aside from that all, I do have a success story.\n\nI was a shy kid growing up, my parents often let me get away with avoiding things I didn't like. In my teens I decided school was too stressful and I started taking days off, before long it became a fear to go. My parents eventually home schooled me and I lost any friends I had made. Suddenly I was stuck in the house too afraid to leave, I was pale and unhappy and my only social interactions were online forums and world of Warcraft.\n\nAt 18 I applied for university, absolutely traumatic! I went in and then left as soon as class was over and went home to hide away in bed. \n\nJust before I graduated university, my father died in front of me. I completely isolated myself after this, uni was over and I had no reason to leave the house anymore. I would spend weeks laying in bed, I couldn't even leave the house to attend his funeral. I was a mess. I left the house just to go to the doctors for anti depressants and anxiety medication but even that was a traumatic experience and I would get taxis everywhere to avoid buses.\n\nOne year later and I just couldn't live like this. My birthday was spent alone in my room surfing the net. My online forum friends said happy birthday and I had a card from my mother but that was it. It didn't matter how many cards or wishes I had, it was the fact that this was me. Alone.\n\n(I forgot to mention that from the ages of 13-22, all the time I spent at home, I was using to teach myself to become a digital artist. And I got good in my late teens . I was able to sell stuff from home to keep me going financially.)\n\nAt 22 I saw a job position. It was a digital artist in a company abroad, this meant a 3 hour plane flight. Keep in mind I had never been on a plane before. I applied out of sheer frustration one night thinking I'd never hear back and then stayed up all night playing wow and went to bed at 6am as usual. When I woke up that afternoon I had an email from the company... they wanted to interview me on skype and then if that went well they would fly me over to have a face to face interview. well, I PANICKED. This was a way out but it was also WAY out of my comfort zone. Even the skype interview was something that kept me awake all night. \n\nLong story short, I ended up getting flown all the way to them. Getting on a plane the first time alone was awful, I was sat next to an old couple and I told them I was scared out of desperation looking for any comfort. I remember ordering sick bags on amazon because I thought I would be sick. I even tried to convince myself the plane would crash and that I should just not go. \n\nBut I went. And I got the job. I've been there a few years now and I got a boyfriend, people I consider friends (but no close friends), and a nice apartment all from doing something I love. \n\nI'm still very depressed and anxious in social situations and people do think I'm weird sometimes because I come across as nervous but my god, if someone like me can make such a big move in life - anyone can. I was an absolute disaster. And my past still haunts me (as mentioned in other posts, not having fun memories of my teens or anything to show for it).  \n\nTL;DR I was a depressed anxious hermit mess and I applied for a job abroad and got it and now I'm still a depressed mess, but I'm doing a lot better.\n\nAnyone have similar experience?\n",

I'm also scared I'll throw up either now or before prom or I'll feel sick for prom and have my day ruined.\n\n\nIs it really possible that how I feel physically is really just all in my head and due to anxiety??

I'm still young, at 21, after all. It feels like a big deal now but I know in the grand scheme of things it won't be. I'm afraid of informing my parents and friends. I wasn't even passionate about what I was studying, I just thought it would be something I could tolerate (I was wrong). So now I'm looking at other options.\n\nHas anyone been in this position before? What did you do? How do you stop feeling like such a failure? \n\nEdit: I just wanted to give a big thank you to everyone who replied. I feel much better reading through all your experiences and advice :)\n\nI've set up a school counsellor appointment to see if I'm eligible for a Leave of Absence and if I do go back then I'll see if I'm able to get disability support.

            "selftext": "I just wrote like 100 words and erased in on the phone. I'm gutted but let's start again. \n\nSo I'm a 32 year old man living in Ireland. Have depression and anxiety for 16 years. I have had thousands of panic attacks and I'm still here. I have attacks about nearly every thing in my life. But they all passed. I wrote before that I am very open about talking about my attacks as I don't feel ashamed anymore and would like to past that to others. I am no way a guru to this quite the opposite but I'm welling to talk and not afraid. So I'm house bound with anxiety a hermit crab we will say. Been house bound for years but I am happy I just want more in life. \n\nAlso excuse the bad grammar and spelling hard to try when brain gone mad. But we will struggle on. \n\nSo I live in Ireland and it's lovely all green and leprechauns. I don't drink (I know shocked) I used to go for a few pints but hangovers and anxiety do not mix. I spend most of my time on my PC or with my family. I used to have friends everywhere calling in and out but as you get older that goes away you don't feel much sadness as its just what happens and I'm still close with every one of them. That's enough about my lifestyle. \n\nI go to a cbt councilor every so often. She has been amazing in so many ways. I used to be so afraid but now I see it as a challenge. I beg anyone that feels they are having any problems go get help why not. If you have car and the engine don't start you get a mechanic. I fully understand that some people it's not that easy, but try and seek it out help is there. I'm.in Ireland and I have the same fear you do not the  thoughts as that is more individual to each of us, but the reasons it happens is all the same physically. \n\nSo when I started writing I had a pressure around my head not bad like just a gentle press like a jumper laying on it. I had a bit of shakes. And the huge thing is the feeling just below my rib cage like a liquid feeling. That is the adrenal gland where a lot comes from. I was sitting In my sitting room now I'm in car on my journey. Honestly I was nervous but typing this out for second time has distracted me so I'm chill. \n\nSo they journey starts my nieces in the car, they are in a bad mood the are young 4 and 2ish. They want trolls soundtrack so I'm on spotify looking for the soundtrack. Was freaking a bit as the Wi-Fi wouldn't cut off and go to mobile data and they where getting angry. Kids are not the greatest for logic. But good for me as put me into chaos situation and forces me to deal with it. \n\nSo down to business I feel the adrenaline push into my stomach. And the start of the attack first I say OK let's do this I feel my feet tingle and the air conditioner in the car feels colder than it is. My body is more sensitive to everything. My eyes are more focused and I'm at alert stations my thoughts are OK as I'm typing on this and I'm.focused on it more. The Adrenalin will pass it might do another squirt but that's OK too. All noises are super focused this is fight or flight I'm sensing a danger but it's not there like its sucks but like its a good thing. If I was in danger I want my senses to be alert I don't want to be getting chased and walking into walls. I feel like I must go to bathroom. And fear I won't make it be embarrassed but fuck it don't care I'm OK just looking for something to conform a fear response. I'm OK at the moment it's like a 3 on panic scale no need for mindfulness but it is always a good thing for anyone to practice panic or no panic. I'm glued to my phone. I have a bottle of water a xanax ( always bring one but never used it to this day just comfort blanket) and pastel sweets with honey resume remedy they are called will link in comment all the stuff I'm talking about after. Just more focused on pushing past anxiety.   I'm about to go into shopping centre next test. I'm like 8 miles from home. \n\nSo new paragraph for shopping centre. Sister decides to go to top of car park always great that more walking. I never use lifts as the feeling uneases me so I use stairs thanks to my sister I get some extra exercise. Still feel the urge to use bathroom so I will I'm a bit dizzy. And sounds ambled up. Sitting in chill area my knee are feeling weak and my constant about noise around me like Superman able to focus on them. And my breath gotta take a deep breath to just chill like a 5 on scale I also lost my sister so I'm afraid my neck is going mad looking left and right my legs are shaky when no stop and I feel off balance. I'm calmer now but still present just more chill. No where near what I was at I hate waiting around my sister is murder for looking at stuff and prolonging the stay I am more of get it done go home which we all are I think. So everything going great then my sister decides to change the plans now we at battle stations as per usual life throws a curve ball. We must wait for here father in law to give him something so my escape plans are fucked this messes me up. I'm grand thou I felt the Adeline enter  my body and I started sweating like I just walked 2 miles and a headache is starting. I was at a 1 now I'm at a 6 with the new news I fell like shouting at my sister but that's not going to help anything let's just take it as another challenge. Worst things is texting someone on phone and they don't respond that is huge trigger for me that few minutes it takes for them to respond. I quit smoking two years ago and moments like these his I just want one. But I know that was not helping me so I am sitting in resting area as my sister does more shopping. God I never expected to write this much sorry for that. So I'm sitting here focused on the phone typing and its working all the systems are at red alert but I'm like floating past them. Letting them take three course. It always passed and we always win. Deep breath in just let myself float and calmness is slowing taking over again.  All the noises are lowering in volume headache still there thou. Just a better feeling of calm and excitement a high feeling of accomplishment. I was so focused on my anxiety I didn't notice I was showing a plumbers bum I laughed mortified but at least something to laugh about. \n\nI feel it's time for new paragraph as it looked messy. I'm. fine now just tired they take the energy out of you. I'm still in the shopping centre but I'm. good I'm OK now. It always passes. I love when I can separate myself and float it's such a great feeling takes practice thou. I'm so sorry I wrote far too much. It's helping me so much just to type it out. Nearly finished now panic is completely gone I might as well be at home. \n\nFound my sister and going home been eventful but win over all.  Gotta keep doing days like this to learn experience winning over them to gain confidence and get back to a normal life. Thanks for everyone that read it. Hope it might help someone. \n\ntl;dr just a blog of my experience in panic attacks from a house bound person going to shopping centre and pushing my limits. \n\nEdit: tried to add links but they got removed need to be more active, all good  and tried to fix some grammar and spelling ",
