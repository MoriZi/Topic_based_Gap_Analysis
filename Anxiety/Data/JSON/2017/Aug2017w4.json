Anyway, most of the initial anxiety stemmed from health concerns - now that I've got a lot of tests done (I am seeing a cardiologist in a week and that will be the final test I do), I really do believe my symptoms are nothing but anxiety.\n\nSo that belief that I am okay has helped heaps...\n\nBut, it's weird...\n\nThere are days where I have very little (or even no anxiety at all), no sensations, no symptoms, etc...\n\nAnd then the next day, I can end up feeling anxious even though there is nothing in my conscious mind / thoughts to warrant it. \n\nie: The last few days have been really good / normal, then yesterday my heart was beating at a normal rate but I could feel each and every heart beat. And today I am feeling a bit on edge, but less so than yesterday, and I suspect tomorrow will be better, etc.\n\nDoes anyone else get this?\n\nDays where it is really good, and days where you are anxious seemingly out of nowhere?\n\nIt's like the brain is running on  some sort of cycle or something. Like a circadian rhythm but an anxiety rhythm? \n\nEDIT: Found this article after posting, it's super helpful and if I didn't put it here some of you may have missed it. Take a read right now, it's worth it!\n\nhttp://www.calmandcourageous.com/hypersensitive-anxiety-stop-checking-feel/",

If another child cried, I cried if another child was happy I was happy, etc. as I got older I've noticed I've always been this way I feel things as if I went through them myself. I feel mad when other people are, embarrassed when they are. I suffered from agoraphobia when I was 18. I was in a negative relationship anxiety and agoraphobia really became noticeable, I left him at 20 and got with a free spirit. Anxiety and agoraphobia disappeared. We ended and at 24 I got with another guy. At first he was very positive but after the honeymoon stage I saw the real him. Extremely angry and negative. Guess how I've spent the last 6 years? Thing is I have 2 children with him, I have no family or friends due to agoraphobia and no job. I am currently trapped in this cycle. How to i feel my own emotions and stop feeling others while having no to access to therapy? Is empathy causing anxiety a thing? I'd love to hear your thoughts. ",

It's not even that I anticipate something terrible everytime, it's like the weight of coming up with replies and engaging the senders is too overwhelming and scary.The uncertainty of not knowing what they will say is also too terrifying for me to cope with. I'll often let emails sit in my inbox for days (or forever) because I'm just too scared to read them. Of course not replying to emails and calls is seen as rude and irresponsible, so people end up getting the wrong idea about me.\n\nThis doesn't just apply to emails. It can be voice messages, phone calls, and even just reddit replies on posts I found particularly stressful.\n\nI've been reaching out to some past contacts, asking them to write me letters of recommendation but I'm to scared too read them.\n\nPlease, how can I over come this?",

All sorts of things trigger it, mainly feeling trapped, but through therapy and exposure it's gotten a lot better!\n\nSomething that always used to make me anxious were car rides, as in riding in a car I'm not driving. I love driving but for some reason being in someone elses car feeling trapped and not in control made me very anxious. It's gotten better where I can go with my parents, girlfriend, and some friends but it still gets bad even with them on occasion.\n\nI was the photographer for a Mercedes Benz AMG driving academy at a race track this week and my boss asked me if I wanted to do a \"hot lap.\" A hot lap was actually riding shotgun for 3 whole laps around Lime Rock Park with a professional race car driver in the [Mercedes GTS AMG](http://i.imgur.com/9GjcuWv.jpg). I was anxious but I was not going to pass this opportunity up because of anxiety. \n\nAnd I did it! I went with an awesome instructor named Kevin and made it out without panic or anxiety! It was like being on a roller coaster and we hit 137mph on the front straight. It was probably the single handed best experience of my life, and I don't think I'll have much of a problem driving with people anymore haha \n\nYou can't see, but I have [the biggest smile under there](http://i.imgur.com/GbfcTj2.jpg)",

            "selftext": "I'm supposed to be leaving for college in 5 days and the love of my life just left me. Two days after my best friend cut me off abruptly, and my cat had just died. Everything is coming at me at once I don't know what to do. I loved this man. I loved him with every fiber of my being, he helped me through so much. He was ALWAYS there for me. He would answer the phone at 5am, he would leave his house 30 mins away to come be with me if I was in a bad place. He was my support system. Now that's all ripped away and I'm more alone than ever.\n\nI know what you're thinking, it sounds like any other dumb young relationship. But I KNOW this was different. I had been with him for years, he was supposed to be coming with me to college and live in a house across the street from me. Then he told me he wasn't going to that school. We talked and I though I got him to change his mind a little and just stay with me until I got on my feet in a new city so I wasn't completely alone. He agreed and I thought everything was gonna be okay. \nBut last night he told me we couldn't be together anymore. My heart is breaking so fucking badly. My anxiety has gotten so bad this past year, I was diagnosed with BPD and it took a toll on him having to be there for me all of the time. But I never thought he could actually do this. We were supposed to get married. \n\nNow I can't even function. I need help Reddit, I'm supposed to leave in 5 days, but I want to go to treatment. But there are so so many obstacles- my insurance doesn't cover emergency mental health inpatient treatment. And with the wait lists as long as they are, I would have to forgo the first week *at minimum* of school.\n\nPlease someone tell me what I should do. I'm so scared and so alone. ",

It's taken me 13 years to accept the idea of professional help.\n\nI would have cyclical bouts of extreme Anxiety and Depression and I was just fed up of feeling like I'm crazy. I asked my doctor for a referral and he made it happen.\n\nThis week I was diagnosed with Borderline Personality Disorder. Anxiety and Depression are a HUGE part of it. I have NEVER felt so clear - my whole life suddenly makes sense. I'm happy o know what's up, because now I can get help and work on myself.\n\nMy point is that Anxiety and/or Depression can be a symptom of something else going on, whether it be mental illness or medical issues. I encourage each and every one of you experiencing symptoms (hell, you might not even realize that you're experiencing some) to reach out to your doctor or a professional.\n\nYou DON'T have to live in pain and suffering.",

My anxiety was reducing me to tears before, during, and after work and I couldn't take it anymore. \n\nMy main goal with my therapist is to overcome my social anxiety, and getting a new job was one of the methods to achieve my goal. After a year of building enough confidence, I landed a job as a cashier at a nearby restaurant. \n\nI worked for 3 days and my anxiety was through the roof. 30 minutes before my fourth day, I had the worst panic attack I've had in a while. I showed up 40 minutes late to my shift, explained to my boss what happened, and he told me to jjust go home, call in the Friday and let him know how I was feeling before my next shift.\n\nInstead I went home, wrote him an email saying I was quitting immediately, deleted my ENTIRE google work account, and blocked his number on my phone. I'm too ashamed to even show my face in the store to collect my paycheck so I'm just letting them keep it. \n\nI feel like a ton of weight came off my shoulders but I feel like a fucking asshole and I just know this is gonna cause me more anxiety in the future. Oh well \n\n",

I have been nearly*** anxiety attack free since I moved out of his place when I lived in NY. And felt even better when I moved to south Florida. I started a whole new life alone which is something I never ever thought I could do. \n\nBut my father has fallen on hard times, jobless and 62 he needed somewhere to stay. I have (had) a spare bedroom so I invited him down to stay with me and try to find work here. Meanwhile I am supporting him financially which isn't my biggest bother. The problem is my anxiety I felt when I was 19 seems to be resurfacing.\n\nThe strangest thing about it though, is when I feel like I'm on the verge of having an episode I see him as my safe person. Though it seems he might be the reason for it in the first place. This strange phenomenon is something I just need to deal with for now, as his job hunt isn't going very well. \n\nI'm just wondering if anyone else has experienced this.\n\ntldr; My dad is the cause of my anxiety, but also my safe person when I feel like I'm having an anxiety attack \ud83e\udd14",

I regularly feel like I'm horribly unqualified for what I'm doing. If I write code, I feel like it's spaghetti. If I dance I feel like I'm committing treason against the very concept of music. If I cook I feel like I'm about to create something outlawed by the Geneva Conventions. Then I see someone else doing the job SO much worse, and rather than making me feel better it just confuses me. Am I supposed to be doing it that way?\n\nBefore the layoff, I was working on a team with someone that made me feel like that. People seem to hate them, they're constantly getting yelled at by the clients, all our co-workers dislike them, and every time I see their paperwork I have to correct or expand on half of it, but the supervisors are giving them excellence awards? I feel like I'm missing something but haven't the foggiest what it could be.\n\nCan't accept that I'm doing okay because of how out of my depth I feel, but on paper I'm doing better than the person getting all the praise. Except I don't get praise, I just get 'very important' work quietly assigned to me and never mentioned again. Makes me crazy, because if I don't generally do a good job they wouldn't give me anything important, but if I do then why is this person who seemingly doesn't getting treated like the shining example of what everyone should do? Why did they make the cut and not me, when I'm topping the board in satisfaction, contributions to the team as a whole, numbers, and accuracy? What do other people know that I don't?",
