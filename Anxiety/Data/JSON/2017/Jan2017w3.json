My ADHD and anxiety (and by extension depression) are just me coming up with excuses for not concentrating, freaking out unnecessarily, and being sad a lot. I don't deserve to use that term. \n\nThat's how the illnesses win. \n\nThey tell you there isn't really a problem, that you're making this stuff up. They tell you that if you try to get help, to confront it, other people will tell you the same thing. \n&gt; \n\"You just want the attention.\" \"You just want the drug prescription.\" \"You just want an excuse for your failure.\"\n\nNo. No. That's not it, I swear. Trust me, please. \n\nBut the people, they don't believe you. They shame you into believing it's a figment of your imagination. They get mad at you for disrespecting the people who *actually* have the disease. And when you try to prove it, by showing them your mess, they scoff. Get over it, they say. Everybody has problems.\n\nAt least, that's what you're told will happen. Otherwise, you'd be able to control the illnesses, keep them at bay. Nothing to hold you back. The illnesses don't want that. They need you to be gullible, so you'll let them stay and grow stronger. \n&gt; \n\"The greatest trick the Devil ever pulled was convincing the world he didn't exist.\"\n\nYour mental illnesses know you better than anyone. They know what makes you tick. They know just how to mess with your mind. Don't Let Them.\n\nI have to remind myself of this every time I inevitably fall for their traps again, believing I can't be, nor deserve to be, helped. \n\nDoes anyone else go through this struggle?",

Once I got to the checkout I looked under my cart and realized something had broken, there was a huge puddle of grape seed oil where my cart was. I apologized profusely to the cashier and the person cleaning it up (I still have no idea how it happened). They had to close the checkout and people were staring. I couldn't get out of there fast enough. Thankfully the cashier was so nice, and I think she could tell how bad I felt. I feel like crying, and am so dizzy I dk how to drive home.

I'm getting all these ideas (again) and I never finish them, or intend to, but just don't.\n\nI don't know if it's the anxiety of not being good enough (could talk about that for a while; my upbringing was a slight problem there) or that things snowball, in that if I don't finish my first project, I feel guilt about it and then I get anxious and can't work on it, which gives me more guilt and more anxiety... you get the idea.\n\nDoes anyone else suffer from this, and if so, how do you overcome it (even on a small scale)?\n\n&lt;3",

I started on Zoloft and found that it worked well but the excessive weight gain and lack of libido weren't helping an 18 year old function normally. I was also prescribed .25mg of Xanax for panic attacks. I switched doctors due to mine not practicing anymore and this new doctor refused to prescribe Zoloft and made me go see a psychiatrist. My psychiatrist prescribed me Luvox. It worked for the most part but I still had 0 libido. This actually helped lead to the ending of a 5 year relationship. We hadn't had sex in over 2 years and neither of us were happy. I stopped taking my medications after the break up because I was determined to make life work without medication. I took up going to therapy. Hated it. It didn't help with crap. All I did was sit there and talk about my week. I'm currently dating someone new and going back to school full time for the first time since 2011. I'm really starting to struggle with my anxiety again. I'm having more and more panic attacks, I'm getting nauseous every time I eat and sometimes even thinking about eating makes me nauseous, and I'm finding that some of my compulsions are coming back. Long story short I don't want to have to go back on medications that cause me to have 0 libido. I'm dating a man in the military and only get to see him once every other month if I'm lucky and I'm not having problems performing now. I don't want to have problems later on either. Help! I'm already 60 pounds heavier than I was when I wasn't on meds and I'm finally getting aroused again!\n\nTL;DR- Having anxiety problems again, need suggestions on meds that don't have libido/weight gain side effects or alternative suggestions!",

You have people who care about you.  And all this will remain true-- nobody can take that away from you.\n\n[Do some meditation](http://i.imgur.com/2nkt1PW.gif), drink something relaxing (I personally recommend a warm tea), post here with us, and we'll get through this together.\n\nAnd as always, we'll be here for you on the [irc live chat](https://kiwiirc.com/client/irc.snoonet.org/anxiety), too.\n\n---\n\n[Wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/wiki/index) | [FAQ](http://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/wiki/faq) | [Types of Anxiety](https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/wiki/anxiety_subtypes) | [Online Resources &amp; Downloads](http://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/wiki/onlineresources) | [IRC Channel](http://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/wiki/irc) | [Community Map](https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/5ff4bn/ranxiety_community_map_update_have_you_added/)",
