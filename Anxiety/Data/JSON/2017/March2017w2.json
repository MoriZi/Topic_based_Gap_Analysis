I used to be so scared to take a shower and I had to take a shot or something with alcohol to do simple things like take a shower. I made it a goal of mine to do it without any substance. \n\nI did it! It was kinda scary but it's these baby steps that help the most. For the past month I've been struggling with derealization and it's been so scary. The best way to get over it is to just face the fact that it won't change. Face your fear. Experience the feeling and don't run from it. \n\nI'm still scared some days but it's getting better the more I allow myself to feel these feelings. \n\nGood luck to you all. We can fight this. We can be Normal again. \n\nEdit: WOW!!! THANKS SO MUCH EVERYONE! I am in tears because of the feedback and support. ",

            "selftext": "So, you might have heard about the new \"Shower Orange\" fad. Basically, it's just eating an orange in the shower. You can look up r/ShowerOrange but it's mostly just people talking about it or taking photos. \n\nAaaaanyway, I tried it a couple of days ago, and now it's part of my \"anti-anxiety arsenal\". Hear me out: \n\n* For me, the most obvious benefit is that it's like a fast, effective meditation, and a great way to anchor myself after or during an anxiety attack. Your senses are all focused while you eat the orange: smell and taste, obviously, but also the contrast between hot water and cold orange, the texture of the peel, the bright colour against the white shower walls, etc. You're 100% in the moment, focused on your task. \n\n* You can be as aggressive as you want, or as slow and gentle as you want. Ripping an orange apart is surprisingly satisfying. Offloading your frustrations on the orange is a non-violent way to let it go. \n\n* You don't have to worry about *anything*. The juice will be washed away by the water, and you can just let the peels fall in the shower and pick them up afterwards. \n\n* Oranges are healthy! That sounds obvious, but getting some fiber, water and vitamins in your body is helpful when you're in a bad place. Showers are healthy too. Again, that sounds obvious, but have you ever been so paralyzed by anxiety that you haven't had a shower in days? The whole thing is very refreshing, and a good way to boost your energy. \n\nSo, yeah! I was skeptical before trying it, and just thought it would be cool. But it turned out to be really helpful for me. Give it a try! =) ",

I haven't had even the time to think.\n\nIn a problem seminar, the same.\n\nAt lunch, they have many stories to explain, regarding their pets, boyfriends and friends, whereas I have barely 2 friends I keep frequently in touch with (and a cute cat, that's probably the only positive thing I'm saying about me, he's called Mochi and he's adorable).\n\nIn the end of the day they were able to study everything they had to, whereas I was too tired to do so.\n\nThey sleep a healthy number of hours. I don't.\n\n*Tl;DR: so I ask you my friend. How am I supposed to make my anxiety of feeling like I'm a shit person disappear if my peers only highlight that I do everything worse constantly?? Are they hiding their struggles? They seem really happy to me tbh.*\n\nEDIT: For those who want to see Mochi the cat: [Mochi with a mochi](http://i.imgur.com/3VJI1Rb.jpg)",

I also tend to compare myself a lot to other people, and I get very down and envious about the fact that I'm not \"as good\", with my well-meaning friends always telling me \"you don't need to be as good, it's not a race, go at your own pace, your work is still appreciated, etc etc\". *I know* logically this is all true. But knowing this doesn't magically make those thoughts go away. No matter how hard I try to articulate this, they just cannot seem to understand and it's endlessly frustrating.\n\nAny advice? Mainly with trying to explain this concept to people, but I guess also with dealing with this knowing/feeling disconnect in the first place.",

It was difficult to do simple things like drive, do the groceries, eat out at a restaurant etc. \n\nAll of those issues led to me being very detached from friends, family, relationships because I always felt like I was burden to be around.\n\nI've been going to therapy for 5 years and I've had periods where my panic disorder was really under control and periods when it would flair up. At the beginning of last year it was the worst I've ever experienced, triggered by an issue in my marriage. \n\nI decided to take up surfing in June last year, because I figured learning something new and challenging myself could help me overcome part of my disorder.\n\nFast forward to today, I just got off a 13 hour flight from Sydney to LA, with an 18 hour stop over and then off to Costa Rica for 2 weeks to surf. On my own. \n\nFor the first time in along time I feel in control and I feel proud of who I am as person.\n\nI couldn't be happier that I got on that plane. My anxiety levels were high, I was stressed, nervous, emotional, but I fucking did it. I hope that today is the day I start taking back full control of my life and fuck-off-anxiety.\n\n\nEDIT: finally touched down in Costa Rica! Haven't felt this excited in years!!! Now, to try and get barreled!! \n\nWe're all gonna make it!",

            "selftext": "I've always had a lot of anxiety issues, most prominent during my childhood and until my early teens (I'm 18 now).  I've never been officially diagnosed with anything, so that makes this a bit harder.  I'm concerned this is pretty silly and light-weight compared to what a lot of people on this sub go through, but I thought I should try posting anyway.  So if it is silly...please be nice ;^;\n\nBasically, there's a bunch of complex problems that are probably rooted in anxiety that I think would be worth seeing a professional about.  A really good friend of mine, who has personal experience with this sort of thing, has urged me to look into it.  I've been making slow steps towards the on-campus counseling my school offers, but the thing holding me back the most is the fear that my problem is going to turn out to be made up somehow or else unforgivably stupid.  I'm afraid I'll go in, give the run-down of the problems, and then find out I've gone and made a terrific fool of myself and that it's all stuff I've made up by overthinking (something I do pretty much chronically), something that wasn't worth the therapist's time or even a problem at all, or that it's something super-easily resolved and thus ridiculous that I made such a fuss out of it, and for years now no less.\n\nI guess maybe if anyone can offer a push, or some experience they can share, that would be really cool.  I think the final step is just to make an appointment now, and I just need to be able to bridge this gap and do that. :'D\n\n[[Basically, long story short, the problem is that I pretty much let my anxiety rule my actions, and I'm worry-obsessed that it's really messed me up at this point, because I can't really tell if it has or hasn't and it's driving me nuts, and the obsession itself is probably harming me more at this point than what I'm actually worrying about.  I would go more in-depth to try and explain it, but I tried in a previous iteration and it got...long-winded, and the problems themselves are (to my knowledge) mostly just sourced in anxiety rather than being anxiety directly.  And so I was too scared to go in-depth for fear it'd be too irrelevant or long.]]\n\nThanks for reading, I appreciate it.  Best of luck with your own issues as well, I know so many people on this sub have really heavy things they're going through, and I hope you guys all find the peace you need and deserve ;__; &lt;/3\n\nEDIT: Thank you all SO MUCH for the support, it has helped me immensely.  I wasn't expecting to see this many replies when I came back, it's really made a difference to me and has been incredibly helpful, I appreciate it so much. &lt;3 It's like I got answers to questions I didn't even know I had.  I'm going to try and find out what it takes to get an appointment today.  Thank you again!!",

My chest is tight, my stomachs in knots and I generally don't want to leave the house. \n\nWork isn't causing any trouble so it can't be that which is the cause.\n\nAny ideas or similar experiences??\n\n\nEDIT!!\n\nIt's wonderful to know we're not alone in this.

It was developed by a person who experienced suicidal thoughts, depression, and anxiety after a head trauma. While he was joking that mentally ill people could use this, it piqued my interest because why not. I've tried a number of things, and I couldn't resist a game that could ease my mental hurdles. \n\nI've only used it a couple of days, but I really like it so far because it helps me visualize my goals of being, well...better. It is an accountability system that sets goals for you(you can add personalized goals too). While it isn't really a \"game\" per se, it is a fun visualization.\n\nI'm not saying it will help you, but it might be worth checking out.\n\nEdit: English is hard. Reworded for clarity.",
