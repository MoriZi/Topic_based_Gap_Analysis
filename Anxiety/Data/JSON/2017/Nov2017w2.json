I recently read an article about it here: https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/happiness-in-world/201308/time-anxiety\n\nI get really anxious about the passing of time, feeling like I'm wasting my life, and basically lose my mind if I'm running late to something. I feel terrible while on the subway or in traffic, especially if it's while going to a movie or a play or a flight - something that's very time-specific and you CAN'T be late for. I end up in such a state of panic that I try and leave early for everything, but still usually end up late anyway since I rely on NYC public transportation, which often has delays. Anyone know a good way to cope with this type of anxiety? I usually just try and read and distract myself as much as possible, but sometimes I get too anxious to focus on a book.",

            "selftext": "I'm really bad at making myself feel better. I just spiral and spiral downward. The silliest things cause me so much anxiety. I know they are silly and wont have a major affect on my life, but it's just not registering in my brain or something. It's like I don't believe myself, and the whole \"it's no big deal!\" thinking is just a ruse, a trick that will be ignored, and my brain is like \"noooo I'm onto you! That won't work\"\n\nHard to explain. I just wish my brain would be rational. I hate having little to no control over how I react and feel to anxiety triggering events, and then obsess over them for the rest of the day.\n\n**Are any of you able to talk yourself out of an anxiety/obsessive thought spiral or at least help ease things a little?**\n\nMy thought process is like \"SHIT, why did I do that? Why did that happen? That could have been avoided. I could have avoided that, if only *this* and *this* happened I wouldn't have been there at that time, in that situation. What series of events led up to this? Why did I do that? I could have done something differently\" and then repeat those thoughts for the rest of the day, like a broken record I can't turn off. Do you think that sounds more like an OCD type of thing? It would suck to have anxiety problems, depression, AND OCD. I don't exhibit any other OCD-like features, though, I don't think.\n\n**edit:** thanks for the good advice! I've been struggling lately but at some point today all my anxiety just vanished away for seemingly no reason. Anxiety is weird. I'm not complaining, though! Definitely glad to be feeling much better, even though it will be back eventually at some point.",

            "selftext": "Hello, Reddit! \n\nIf it's not too much to ask, I'd like to please have just a little bit of your time, especially if you are someone who is going through a rough patch right now. Thank you!\n\nHere's a little background: I am feeling so down right now. I had never in my life before felt pain this intense, and it hit me like a train. I feel so broken. It has been a while since the incident happened, but I am still grieving. I haven't--and I couldn't--stop crying at night. \n\nBut then I thought about you guys.\n\nAnd I couldn't help but empathize with the people out there in this world who feel the same way as I do right now, especially those who are going through so much more. It's unfair that a person should feel this way. \n\n*Now, I don't know a lot of things, and I do not claim to. We all come from different walks of life. But here is just a little something for each and every one of you who are down in the dumps.*\n\nWhatever it is that you're going through right now, I know it hurts. *You* know it hurts. You feel it. People will tell you that your problem is far too minuscule (or at least compared to theirs), but it doesn't matter--it still hurts, and it's still crushing you inside. \n\nDon't listen to them. We all take pain differently, and your problem isn't any less real than theirs. \n\nKnow that it's okay to acknowledge the pain. Take some time to grieve. Sit with your feelings and just let it hurt.\n\nBut, also, please know that you are capable. You have the power to get through this. You *will* be okay. You can get yourself back out there and live your life. \n\nThere is a whole world out there. . . It's just unfortunate that you're trapped in *this* particular hellhole that's tricking you into thinking you're just another brainless gear in this big machine. \n\nIt's not your fault; society just works that way. But you could promise yourself--right here and right now--that you'll try to break free from it, and strive for the kind of life that you want to live. \n\nYou *are* capable. You *will* be okay.\n\nMaybe you made a mistake. Maybe it was a HUGE mistake. \n\nLearn to forgive yourself first. Only then can you move on and start anew. \n\nIf you're feeling trapped in your routine, try to break from it by switching things up. It could be the smallest things--maybe you could sleep on the other side of your bed. Maybe you could try rearranging the furniture in your room, and make it feel like a completely different place. Maybe you could *decorate* your room. Maybe, instead of eating cereal every morning, you could treat yourself to a nice chocolate muffin twice a week. Maybe you could take a different route to work/school, preferably one with a nice scenery.\n\nIt all sounds silly, but I assure you that there is joy to be found in small things like that. If it's not working, try experimenting some more! \n \nPlease know that you matter. Your life is valuable. \n\nRemember that time an acquaintance said something nice that brightened up your day? Or that one time a waiter gave you an extra drink free of charge? Or that one time a stranger did nothing more than flash a warm smile, but it still made you feel good inside?\n\nCould you imagine a world without people like them? \n\nWell, these are common people. And *you* are one of these people. You may never realize it, but you've *definitely* had a positive impact on this world, just by existing alone. . . And you have more to contribute. \n\nIn one way or another, we are interconnected. And your existence is important. Please understand that. \n\nI have to admit, these are things I don't *always* realize, so the fact that I'm giving out these pieces of advice may come off pretentious and hypocritical. I am also aware that others may disagree. \n\nBut please understand that I have nothing but the best intentions. \n\nWhat I want is for you all to take care of yourselves and be well, because I, too, am in pain and feel that no one deserves to be in this position. Now, if this post isn't quite helping, I hope you find whatever works for you. Regardless, I wish you guys the best. \n\nI say all of this from the bottom of my heart.\n\nI may not personally know you, reader, but I will be sending my love out to you. Know that you are loved. \n\nI wish I could do more, but this is all I have to offer.\n\nWe will get by, no matter what. \n\n(P.S. I will also be posting this on other subreddits, so I hope you guys don't mind if you happen to see it more than once on your feed. Thank you!)",

            "selftext": "I just have to let this out somewhere because my family are 3000 miles away and my husband is currently sleeping in the next room and I don't want to disturb him. \n\nSince emigrating, I've really struggled with going outside and human interactions in general. I don't like straying off too far by myself so stick with a mile patch around our apartment. Even then, I have to mentally prepare myself before I go. Most of the time, I am able to do my daily activities without incident and can hold conversations with cashiers and other folks in stores. \n\nToday we ran out of a few groceries so I nipped out. I then decided to treat myself to some breakfast and went to a cafe nearby. The place was really packed out so I was feeling a little out of sorts when I went to the front to be served. The interaction was just terrible. After taking half of my order, the server suddenly flipped and was really harsh with me and berated me for not raising my voice to satisfactory levels in front of the other customers. Bear in mind, I've been in there plenty of times at various points throughout the day and no one else serving me has had an issue with my volume or asked me to repeat myself. I initially tried smiling it off because her tone caught me completely off guard but she carried on and would not drop the subject. I just felt so humiliated and embarrassed. I quickly got what I wanted and ducked out. \n\nI just let the tears out in the elevator up to the apartment and sat on the sofa feeling thoroughly miserable. I also managed to give myself a nosebleed which didn't help matters. My tears weren't just from anxiety but shame too- I'm a grown woman and being reduced to a nervous wreck whenever things go awry, is embarrassing and exhausting. \n\nI felt like I was making progress but have been knocked back a fair bit and it's frustrating. I'll definitely be avoiding the cafe for now too. ",

Hopefully someone here can relate and share advice/experience.\n\nThere are moments where I just can't understand what a person is saying to me. It usually happens mid conversation when there's a lot of competing background noise. A few words will sound filtered or muffled all of a sudden, and I'll have to ask the person to repeat themselves - often times more than once. Sometimes I'll quickly fill in the blanks in the hopes that my response doesn't have me looking like a dipshit. I can say that both choices have backfired numerous times, and that sucks. Awkwardness sucks. It also sucks because nowadays I get sorta pissed off at the person trying to talk to me, and I don't think that's fair at all. I think \"raise your damn voice\" or \"quit mumbling.\" Makes me feel old even though I am only 22. \n\nThat's it. \n\nAgain,  any thoughts/experience/advice appreciated.",

I can't enjoy playing video games anymore, or any leisure activity at all, because I have this background worry that I'm just wasting my time.\n\nAll I have during the day is my job. And then what? I come home and be useless all day? My job doesn't give me much purpose if any. What can I do besides watch TV or sit around?\n\nRecently, the more time that went by, the more I felt as if I needed to do something *important*. But I don't know what that means. Does it mean I should have some kind of influence, that I should somehow leave my mark on the world? Why would that matter?\n\nI sat down with myself recently and wrote out my thoughts on that, and I concluded that the only person I should care about in that regard is myself. I should focus on making myself happy. I should do things that I want to do and not think about whether or not that gets anyone's attention.\n\nBut I don't know what that is. If it makes me happy, should I just play video games all day? Well, I don't feel good playing games anymore. It makes me feel worse, again, like time is just slipping by. I just can't relax anymore. I'm constantly on edge. I can feel my heartbeat pounding. Sometimes I forget about it all and I calm down, but at night, when I'm alone with my thoughts, I can't relax.\n\nThere's just something missing, and I don't know what to look for or how to look for it. There *are* a few things that I do want to accomplish, but they all involve me being shut in my room. And I don't feel like I have time to do them anyway.\n\nWhat do I do? How do I quit wasting time? I just don't have a purpose. I don't know how to find one. Or maybe that's not it, but it's the closest thing to what I'm trying to get at. I can't sleep anymore, it's driving me crazy.",
