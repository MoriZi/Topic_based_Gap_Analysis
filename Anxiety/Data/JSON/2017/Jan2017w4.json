I had to make an immediate appointment with my therapist to discuss how despondent I felt. \n\nIn the weeks since, I've avoided news coverage and, thus, have felt better and have been more able to distance myself mentally from what's going on. However, after the inauguration and attending the women's march in Washington, I'm again feeling out of sorts. I know I need to again stop watching news--but for four years? I want to stay aware and active, but it may be at the expense of my mental health. \n\nI was walking around the grocery store today and just wanted to cry for everyone there. I'm truly disturbed by what is happening and I fear I don't have the right coping mechanisms for the next four years.\n\n\nEditing to add: This isn't as political as it may seem. I think for a variety of reasons he triggers anxiety in a number of people. And if you are feeling anxious, it's very much a real thing. It's really about finding ways to cope (and vent).\n",

They're just words that I can't string together to make coherent thoughts or judgements. \n\n I have this self-talk when I'm reading that goes like this. *\"I'm so worried I'm becoming less intelligent, can I understand this word? maybe it's from not getting enough sleep, what about this word? Maybe it's just because I don't understand the material, because I'm becoming a vegetable.\"*\n\nThis self talk happens while I'm reading, or at work, and my anxiety will kick in and I can't perform the simplest tasks. If I had to say how much I think about my anxiety and my waning intelligence per day, it would probably be around 60% to 70%. And I fear that I can't gain this intelligence back. \n\nI know because my brain is occupied with the thoughts of anxiety, it can't process other information, like interpreting words that I'm reading or listening to customers at work. But I don't know how to shake the anxiety. \n\nDoes anyone else feel they are somehow less cognitively adept because of anxiety? How does it manifest itself for you? I surely can't be the only person who feels like this, can I? ",

            "selftext": "I have struggled with anxiety for nearly all of my life. One thing I will say that I have learned is that my anxiety tends to start as an uneasy feeling in the pit of my stomach with no obvious trigger or real reason... It gets worse when I don't eat properly, don't get enough sleep, or am sedentary for too long. Now with all that being said, one of the most important things I have learned is that when that uneasy feeling comes up and you understand logically that there is nothing to be anxious about DO EVERYTHING IN YOUR MENTAL CAPACITY NOT TO ASSIGN REASONS TO THE FEELING. You have to be very in tune with yourself and your anxiety, but if you can recognize it when it creeps up and acknowledge the feeling without letting it overtake you mentally then that is a HUGE milestone towards developing a healthy understanding of yourself and your relationship with how you were made. \n\nAs individuals with anxiety, we are wired for struggle, but we don't have to let anxiety overtake us! Now, I understand that anxiety is a spectrum. Some people have more difficulty staying in control than others when anxiety hits them and anxiety attacks can present themselves in many different ways. However, in my personal experience when I start to feel that nervous feeling in the pit of my stomach and my breath shortens and heart rate increases, I don't think \"Why am I feeling this way? What is wrong with me/my life?\" and try to find a source or reason to justify my feelings of anxiety. I simply notice the feeling and acknowledge it for what it is and then do something that I know helps me feel better! Getting some fresh air helps me return to a centered and grounded state. Going outside for a walk, doing yoga, or reading some books on mindfulness to realign myself with a healthy mental perspective is incredibly beneficial. It will be different for everyone, so you have to find what works for you! \n\nI hope this helps some other people who are struggling. These are just a few things that I wish I understood and could have used to help myself cope earlier in life. ",

I get very little government assistance because I \"make too much money\" but I live in a big city so adjusting for my cost of living I barely make above minimum wage. And I am paying about 15% of my monthly income on insurance. \n\nAnd due to rising costs every year I have to keep changing my insurance which means changing my dentist and my GP. You know what's great for a person with anxiety? Make them get in touch with a bunch of hard to contact strangers praying they take your magical doctor card so you can pay a copay for the medication that helps you just barely function. And also be scared the entire time they aren't actually in your network and you will still get slapped with a big bill when you least expect it, just waiting in your mailbox when you come home from work ready to kill your mood. \n\nI work hard at my job. I asked for a raise a few months ago and my boss assured me he is \"working on it.\" I asked for the bonus at the end of the year I was owed and he said he'd \"see what he can do.\" And I haven't heard anything. I started last February so he might pull that \"you weren't here the whole year\" stuff. I am close to my anniversary at my job and I am scared so ask for a raise again but I am getting pissed off about it. I work for a small company and I love my coworkers but this struggle is hurting me. \n\nI looked at jobs last week in desperation. Just in case. It's miserable and it made me cry. I dare not jeopardize my job because it's probably the best I can do and that makes my heart hurt that I am so trapped. \n\nAnd if nothing else I was banking on getting a decent sized tax return. I filed today and...it's the smallest return I've ever had. \n\nAnd this is just about money and health insurance! It's an endless struggle. Why live? I have to believe it will get better...but...why? How? And I know I'm not the only one. And I know others have it even worse. I just honestly don't know why I am living through all of this. This is not a life. \n\n",

            "selftext": "I had a panic attack at work yesterday in front of my colleagues, and it was very embarrassing. I was in a meeting with my supervisor when she announced that staff who I frequently work with in my program will be meeting with me immediately after our meeting to discuss expectations of me and invite me to ask questions. I said ok, even though I was annoyed that I was given no notice and I didn't prepare for it, but I thought I could handle it. Wrong. Everyone came in and immediately my heart started pounding and I was terrified. I have a fear of failure and even though I knew these people weren't here to criticize me, I started experiencing the symptoms of a panic attack. \n\nThey wrote up a document of expectations for me that I knew nothing about and discussed it with me, asking me questions about what I think and if I have anything to add. I felt like everyone banded together to attack me and my performance, even though they were there to clarify my responsibilities and who I go to for questions. Still, I felt nauseous, excused myself to catch my breath, and cautiously returned. When I returned, no one said anything about my obvious discomfort. I barely could comprehend what they were saying, I couldn't answer their questions, stumbled over my words. I felt weak, nauseous, terrified, couldn't catch my breath. And they all saw it. I could tell how uncomfortable and confused I made them, but I could barely contain my own discomfort and confusion. \n\nAfterwards everyone left except my supervisor and she was not pleased. She basically said I need to get my act together and work though my anxiety. I was holding back tears. I asked if I could work from home and she said yes, only if I promised to work, even though she knows that I am an honest and hardworking employee. When I got home I emailed her and told her that she needs to give me notice for situations like this so I can prepare and I asked if we could reschedule the meeting. She said ok. Now it's the weekend and I have to go back to work on Monday and somehow continue to work with the same folks who I imagine now think of me as some sensitive, fragile idiot who can't accept feedback. \n\nI don't know what to do. I'm embarrassed and angry. How do I move forward from this? \n\nedit: thank you everyone for being so supportive and kind :) this sub is wonderful. i feel much more confident now about facing the day tomorrow!",
