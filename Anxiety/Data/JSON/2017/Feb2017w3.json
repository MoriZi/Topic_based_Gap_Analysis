This is a copy and paste from one of my responses.\n\n*In essence I stopped taking medication on hogmanay and I started listening more to my thoughts. You see in my case there are 2 voices in my head, the rational guy and the irrational guy. I used to think I was the rational guy and the irrational guy was the asshole that won every argument. I've come to the realisation that I'm neither the rational guy or the irrational guy, I'm just stuck in the middle of these 2 pricks screaming at each other all day. They are trying to get each other into shit and making stuff up. It's white noise. I'm now blocking out the white noise to pursue my daily goals without interruption. I feel like I've just turned a hoover on and I'm struggling to hear them. I know they are there, still bickering like a couple of dickheads but the hoover is on and I'm too fucking busy cleaning to care!*",

For a lifetime of this, and ultimately my preventable death.  \n\nThanks for the awesome commiseration and feedback. Jut FYI, i have had a battery of heart tests(EKGs, stress tests, sonagram, xray). Everything always comes up clean. Part of the frustrating \"no one is allowed to dismiss it\" part is that even my psychiatrist didn't want to prescribe anything to me until I'd gotten tested. how nice it would be to just hear the words \"ya, its just panic, relax,\" from a medical professional, let alone one who's specialty it is.

The most I've ever been alone is two hours. I didn't view it as something scary.  I saw it as \"well if I can survive 3 hours,  what else can they throw at me?\" \n\nThe same as when I went on a first date with my now girlfriend.

            "selftext": "It's always been something I have feared but it's got so much worse since developing anxiety. I think it stems down to the fact I had a tooth removed when I was only 5. Doesn't sound like a big deal but my mum didn't tell me I had to have it removed till the actual day. She just woke me up and got me in the car and told me we were going to the hospital (the children's dentist was at the hospital) so they could put me asleep and remove my tooth. Obviously at 5 that seemed pretty scary, didn't help that I had to wait 3 hours when I got there. Then again at 7 I had another tooth taken out and it hurt so much I couldn't eat but when I got back to school the teacher forced me too. So now I hate the dentist I have this fear they will end up pulling all my teeth out, which I know is stupid but I can't help it. I'm 17 and havnt been since I was about 9, I desperately need to go because depression and anxiety resulted in me not brushing my teeth often enough and now they look terrible and I also need and would like braces. My main worry is one tooth which has a hole in it and the hole is turning black (tooth decay I'm guessing) I terrified they will just pull it out. Anxiety is really making all my fears worse and not to mention the thought of going into the office and lying down while someone prods around in my mouth, I have severe social anxiety so many situations like dentist and doctors appointments make me nervous enough as it is. I don't know what to do I'm going to ask my mum to book an appointment but I won't be able to stop panicking till it's all sorted.\n",

For myself my ultimate relax is to watch twitch on my phone in my bed before sleeping, with my favorite streamer. When I start to feel panicky and think about this/assure myself that I will be able to do that later in the evening, my anxiety starts do disappear to totally be gone in 10-15 minutes.\n\nYou must have something that gives you the ultimate relax as well, especially things you do in the evening or before sleeping are perfect for this.\n\nMight be worth giving a try.

It usually takes a couple hours to come out of, but while I'm in the depression I just seem to hate my life and myself. Is this normal for some people? It's been really bad lately. I don't want to complain about it to people in my life because it feels so trivial and that they'll just say it's nothing to worry about or something. Any similar experiences here? It would just be nice to talk about it a little. Thanks guys!",

I use to take Xanax as needed a few years back, not anymore. I was thinking of restarting the prescription.\n\nI do not abuse drugs. I was given the prescription for Xanax with 15 pills and 3 months later I had 7 left. I explained eveyrthing to my doctor and he smiled at me and said\n\n\"Try yoga, meditating..\" I said \"I did, I took yoga classes and meditation w music. This is debilitating I throw up before these scenerios and I can't even introduce myself to my new classes which is a simple \"Hi, my name is xyz and I am majoring in xyz\".

When I was a kid, my mum just said I was being respectful, but in all honesty she just missed a lot of the signs of my anxiety. Actually, I've never called my parents 'mum' and 'dad' to their faces. I called them mummy and daddy when I was a kid, then when I was about 7/8 one of my 'friends' picked on me for it. So I stopped, but didn't move on to the more grown up variations. This could be a separate thing, I don't know. \n\nAnyone else have a similar problem?",
