I'm terrified to. \nMy neighbour takes advantage of this. She takes advantage of everyone who will let her and unfortunately she ended up living beside me. I have lent her money, given her food (I have a family to feed), I have lent her every movie I own, given her milk and sugar countless times, plunged her toilet, helped her set up her internet and cable, listened to her cry about whatever's bothering her today. She used to make up wild stories all the time about people watching her from my back yard and wouldn't stop when I said there's nobody there. I put up a motion light FFS.\n\nGood lord why have I done all this? I'm not even her friend. Wow I'm a chump.\n\nAnyway. She just called me and asked me to get her smokes and she could pay me back tomorrow. I said \"I'm sorry, I can't\". She asked if I didn't trust her and I said that wasn't it at all, that I just have to start saying no to people. \"Not just you, my sister as well as others\". She gave me her usual sob story and \"I don't know what I'm going to do\" etc etc and she sounded pretty choked. \nI once said no to her before. She came over for the *third* night in a row to say that someone stole her outside lightbulb and needed my husband to put in a new one. We had company over and were literally sitting down to eat, food on plates already. I said \"no, sorry, he can't, we have company...\" \"Oh but I need it to watch...\" She starts getting upset and I said \"even if I asked him he's going to say no as we are literally just sitting down to eat\" \"well I don't know what I'm going to do\" \"sorry\" then she gets all snobby as if to say \"thanks for nothing\". What a shitty person. She acts so sweet so though.\n\nAs I type this all out I feel outraged. I've always known it's been bullshit, and generally I'm not the one to put up with shit, but I can't say it to someone's face. Because I fear conflict so bad, I guess. I get major panic attacks if there's a bad conflict and I'm even near it.\nI have a psych appt. tomorrow so I guess I'll bring this up (again).\n\nI'm feeling pretty proud that I said no, though! Now to just say no the next hundred times she calls or knocks. :)\n",

Even though I love him, I wish he'd just go away. He's going to see I'm a loser and never want to talk to me again. How humiliating.\n\nIt's not like my life is terrible, but I've always wanted to be a musician, or make films, or own my own business. And I constantly tell myself YOU COULD'VE STARTED 10 YEARS AGO! I try to do these things now, but people on YouTube or in the industries are SO good at what they do. The barriers to entry are just too high.\n\nI stay up at night trying to figure out what to do with my life. It's almost 4am right now. I won't settle for just an average life, I want to do something with my life and it constantly gives me anxiety/depression.\n\nAnyways, personal issues aside, anyone else get this sort of anxiety? I don't know how to make it stop, but I am seeking therapy at the moment. I think part of the issue is that I'm getting older and have very little to show for it.",

I can't figure out what to think about. That's when the hopeless discomfort really kicks in.\n\nIt's as if I just can't casually relax. I become trapped in a mental cage that prevents productive thought or activity. Healthy, interesting thoughts form in my mind during these bouts, but I can never progress them. They're immediately quelled by a dominating feeling of unease.\n\nI've been like this for years. Not 100% of the time, but a decent enough chunk to impact my well-being.\n\nI have hobbies and interests that provide relief at times, but recently the wasted hours have been plaguing my mind more and more.\n\nI have goals, too. I suppose I should decide firmly what to do with my time and stick to that schedule?\n\nI\u2019m sort of at a loss as to what to do. I feel as if I\u2019m wasting my life.

All anxiety is terrible, but mine is weak compared to what I've read.. and that fact alone gives me so much respect for each and every single one of you guys. \n\nAnyway, a week or so a go, I was reading a thread on this sub-reddit and saw someone repeat a technique their therapist taught them to calm them self down. The technique (from memory) went like this:\n\nLook at 5 things\nTouch 4 things \nHear 3 things \nSmell 2 things, and\nTaste 1 thing\n\nI've battle tested it and it works amazingly for me. I guess it adds more dimension to just mindfulness. Give it a go and see how it works out. I really do hope it serves some help!\n\nSide note: I'm so sorry not giving credit to the original poster, if you do see this just comment it was your comment and I'll more than gladly give you credit :) ",

I landed in between the bed, the wall, and the bench in a heap. Before I knew it I just started cracking up with my mom who desperately tried hoisting me up out of my pile of broken bench pieces. \n\nNeedless to say, that was the first time in a long time that I have laughed that hard and it felt so good. The purpose of this little story is just to let anyone who is feeling so down and poorly about anxiety or life in general know that it is possible to feel happy once again, even just for a moment. I know that it may not seem like it, but if we keep hanging onto these little joyous moments and let them fill us up during times of anxiousness  , then I'm sure we can make it through&lt;3 :) I hope your moments are a little less painful though!

To say the very least, it has caused a strain on both of our lives and our relationship.\n\nI have thoughts about being unlovable. Not worth it. That he's going to leave me, cheat on me, etc. I constantly wonder if he's falling out of love with me. Asking him \"Do you still love me?\" doesn't work because it annoys him and him getting annoyed/impatient makes me feel even MORE insecure.\n\nThis is the man I want to be with for the rest of my life. And please know, this is only MY perspective. Please don't tell me he's unsupportive or that I should be with someone else or be alone. He's doing his best, he just doesn't know how to help me. \n\nSo how can I help him help me? If I tell him exactly what I want to hear, and he repeats it back to me, it loses it's meaning and doesn't make me feel better. Are there resources for someone who has a SO with anxiety/depression? \n\nI need constant reassurance that he loves me and wants to be with me. I'm a \"words of affirmation\" type of girl and he just doesn't see the need to say the same thing more than once. But like I said, I need constant reassurance. I know it's not fair to him. I know I'm annoying. \n\nIs there a way we can meet in the middle? So that I'm getting the love/reassurance I need but he doesn't feel like he's constantly catering to my anxiety? Because I don't want him to feel that way, and I'm worried that's what is happening. ",

I'm currently attending a shitty state school where I double major in Comp Sci and Math. Graduation from this school with these degrees would guarantee me a position as a code monkey. I dread a future where my only pleasure is in pinning the newest XKCD to my cubicle wall. Anyways in order to try and avoid having this be my future I've been trying to maintain a high GPA so I can be accepted into a better school. Well, I just got my grades from this semester back and I received two C's. I blame this equally on a two-month period of intense depression as well as my own incompetence/lack of intelligence. I foresee a summer spent drinking everclear, raising my SSRI dose to a dosage which would tranqualize a moose, and hating myself. \nAnyone else here slowly ruining their life/wasting their resources until suicide is the only option?",
