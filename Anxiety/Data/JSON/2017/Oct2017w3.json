            "selftext": "As the title implies, I feel like after dealing with anxiety for over a decade I've gotten my poker face perfected. When I had my first panic attack in high school I had no idea how to hide it. The first few months after my anxiety really kicked in I cried and freaked out in public, in class, at 2am with my mom, you name it. Eventually, I learned to sort of keep it under wraps, and I feel like it's been that way ever since.\n\n I've gone on to hold multiple stressful jobs, am currently doing well in a very rigorous grad school program, have plenty of friends, and have been in a great relationship for over 3 years, and all this time I feel like I have been able to mostly keep it hidden. While my anxiety definitely waxes and wanes, I feel like I never mention it to anyone unless it is to the point it is unbearable, and even then I just excuse myself and say I feel anxious without making a scene, or I make jokes about it.\n\nNow this has recently become a problem. With some additional stressors in my life I feel like my anxiety is coming back in full force and while I probably seem the same from the outside, I'm starting to have multiple panic attacks a day/ high levels of anxiety, while driving, hanging out with friends, in class etc. When I try to bring it up I feel like people don't believe me because I don't \"seem\" anxious. I probably look fine on the outside but I am having an absolute meltdown inside my head. \n\nAnyways not sure what the solution is to all this. Is it good to keep your anxiety under control outwardly even if it isn't the same inwardly? I certainly can't express every time I feel anxious, I would never get anything done and would probably be the biggest downer in the word to hang out with.  The other day I expressed to my gradschool counselor that my anxiety was getting really bad but he said I looked like everything was under control and my grades were great so why don't I just drink some tea, take a bath, and meditate. I wanted to scream, like oh all I have to do is take a bath and my TEN YEARS OF ANXIETY ARE CURED???? GEE THANKS! \n\nDoes anyone else feel this way???",

Everyone else has a car, drives to school, has a job, has a boyfriend/girlfriend, and a lot of girls i know have had sex already. I just can\u2019t help but feel that everyone around me is so much \u201ccooler\u201d. I go to a very small school so everyone pretty much knows each other, and everyone\u2019s always going to parties, has a lot of friends, drinks and smokes and stuff like that. \nI don\u2019t even want to do that stuff but I feel like it\u2019s so normal for 17 year olds to at least have had the experience of doing those things.  Also I feel like everyone is really talented at something, whether it\u2019s a sport, art or something. I\u2019m not good at anything; I have no purpose in life. Everyone\u2019s talking about the great colleges they wanna go to/have gotten into and I still don\u2019t know where I wanna go, idk if I\u2019ll even get into a state school.  Because of all these things I feel like I\u2019m behind everyone and just not as good as them in general:(\nI have my license but no car because my family doesn\u2019t have the money to buy another one and I don\u2019t have a job to save up money for one. I used to have one but the anxiety was too much so I quit. I\u2019m a senior in high school and the only one who still has to take the bus to school, or my mom drops me off. I\u2019ve also never had a boyfriend or even held a guy\u2019s hand. I have a couple friends but I don\u2019t go to parties or even really hang out with anyone outside of school because anxiety makes me assume everyone hates me and wouldn\u2019t wanna hang out with me. Like I said before, I\u2019m not talented at anything so I feel kinda worthless. I\u2019m also not pretty and I\u2019m kinda chubby, \u201cthick\u201d or whatever you wanna call it so it\u2019s not like I have that going for me lol. Anxiety just makes me feel like such a piece of garbage compared to everyone else. Does anyone else feel like that/felt like this when you were my age? Sorry for the super long post btw  ",

I usually don't go out because I'm not comfortable with how I look and depression tends to make me look more on the unkempt side. I haven't been outside in a while and my mom wanted me to go the supermarket.\n\nI gathered my courage and braved it out. i admit I did look a bit not well put together my hair was kind of frizzy  and messy. But i did my best to tame it and i was wearing a baggy sweater with sunglasses, but I thought to myself \"I'm just going to the market, not the red carpet\" I almost regretted my decision when i stepped out  because I saw lots of people my age and they were well dressed. That gave me a lot of anxiety and I saw some give me weird looks. But i decided to try and not be so sensitive and ignored if i thought they might have looked at me bad or not, since no matter what i look like, i still have a right to be outside and get food. \n\n\nThat thinking did help me a lot. I thought i was going to have a panic attack and run back home. But i kept going! I'm not sure when the next time i will go out, but I'm glad i was able to get some food and not care that much of what others thought especially of my looks and kind of go on autopilot mode! since it is kind of rare or maybe I'm just tired of caring so much lol. Those with anxiety and struggling with similar issues like me, you can so do it!  :)",

My hands begin to shake, I start to stutter, I start to worry about if she can tell, I hesitate, and then I just forget about it. *sigh*\n\nI usually just tell myself 'well if confidence is so important that she can't see all my wonderful qualities, then I don't want to be with anyone like that anyway, hmph!\" (But really I'm actually very sad). \n\nI'm in my early thirties, I see guys who don't have a problem with this meeting and dating so many different women. I think that would be nice. I get a bit jealous, and start to wish women would approach men a bit more often. It seems like the guys who aren't anxious about asking women out, or for their numbers, are the guys who most of the women want anyway. \n\nAnyway, I could go on.
