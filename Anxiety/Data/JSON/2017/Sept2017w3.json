            "selftext": "Hey guys. I recently became aware of my irrational fear of playing video games (multiplayer).\n\n\n\nAs far as I can remember I was always afraid of playing video games especially action games/shooter games and worst of all multiplayer games.\n\n\n\nI am one of the guys who was excited to buy games but never in playing them. I liked watching my friends and siblings play the games. But I could never make myself play games.\n\n\n\nNow after experiencing mental health issues for 8 years (and becoming aware of difficulties prior to that) I feel like my fear of playing video games (multiplayer ones) is kind of related to my severe social and overall anxieties.\n\n\n\nDoes anyone else has same experience?\n\n\n\nI am sure here are many gamers on the sub. What were your experiences like?\n\n\n\n\n**Edit: Well I'm blown away. I thought the post would get lost. I didn't expect this big response. Thanks you guys.**\n\n\n\n**Edit 2: Many folks here seem to be wary of voice chat and co-op. I hadn't even considered that part. I can't even face solo play well. Forget about co-op and voice chat stuff. I seem to be afraid of failing and not performing. Not looking perfect. I have same problems with real life social situations. And almost all performance situations.**",

            "selftext": "And I'm **freaking out.** The thought of the whole thing makes me feel like I'm going to vomit. \n\nI met this guy in a chatroom when I was 15 years old. He was some 18 year old guy from India I never expected to connect so deeply with. Fast forward 8 years and he's got an awesome job here in the States and we finally have the opportunity to meet up in Denver, CO (someplace both of us have been dying to visit) and vacation for a week. \n\nMy anxiety has *always* gotten in the way of any relationship I've had of any kind, and this one has been no exception. What seems like the smallest things have given me the most anxiety throughout our 8 years of talking, from telling him my name, sending him a picture, talking on the phone, and skyping. The crazy thing is we had plans for me to fly out to where he lives in San Francisco back in March... and I cancelled a few weeks beforehand. I still feel absolutely horrible for doing that to him, but inspite of all of it, he still finds a way to be incredibly patient with me.  \n\nNow here we are, a month out from the first vacation I've had in years, my first time visiting a city I've been dying to see, and meeting one of my closest friends in person for the first time and for some reason, all I want to do is cry. Every detail has me questioning if this is going to be a disaster. **What if I miss my flight? What if the airport loses my luggage? What do I do when I see him for the first time? Should I hug him? What if he doesnt think I look as good as my pictures? What if we have nothing to talk about? We have one whole week together, what the hell are we gonna do in all that time? What if we have a horrible time and we never speak to each other again afterwards? What if we *really* end up liking each other? Does that mean we're going to start a relationship?**\n\nI'm so tired of letting my anxiety run the way I live. I just wish I could embrace and enjoy the excitement of all of this, but my mind always finds a way to distort it into something that's going to end terribly...",

There is no evidence that September 23rd will be the Apocalypse, and there is honestly no reason to let that fear ruin your life.

The ones who legitimately have health issues surrounding world events. \n\nI was spurred on to make this post due to a headline I read a few minutes ago relating to North Korea (eugh). So for those of you who don't want to hear about it, stop reading now.\n\nThe headline wrote 'Trump vows to destroy North Korea'. My heart skipped several beats, I was debilitated, scared and on the floor. Then I looked further into it, I watched Trumps speech to the UN and discovered the level of lying that this website had displayed. His quote was saying how if North Korea attacked the USA or it's allies, he would destroy it. \n\nThey are totally different things!! One implies Trump is about to launch a full on attack onto the country, one simply reinforces what America's been saying for years, if NK attacks SK, America will defend SK.\n\nThis pisses me off, it hurts me and many others physically and mentally, it affects our lives but these greedy editors and will go to the greatest lengths to make a bit more cash.",

I thought the holidays would help but about two hours after being back, I'm having a new panic attack and locked away on the bathroom with a crying fit. No one at work would even understand if I went home because I just got back, and it amps my anxiety even more knowing what they would think if I left and went to the doctor. They might think I'm just skipping work for fun.\n\nI'm so tired of this. I can't quit valium because I'm constantly needing the SOS. I left sertraline because I was sure I didn't need it but this thing just keeps coming back. And the worst part is that I can't afford professional CBT therapy which my insurance doesn't cover it.\n\nI feel cursed. I have a pretty good life, why can't I just enjoy it ???",

Every single list you find on google for good interview signs I could check off.  Double the allotted time.  Interviewer was smiling and laughing.  Hit every question out of the park, definitely qualified, talked about non-job related stuff/personal stuff.  Told me they'd get back to me by mid-next week, etc. etc.\n\nTook them almost two weeks to get back to me, and it was just an informal \"Thank you for your time, we have moved on to other candidates\"\n\nI'm trying to move in with my Fiance and save for a wedding, I can't do it on this salary right now.  So this job is a lifeline for me, and I can't seem to get it.  I'm so terrified of the future, and I have no idea what's wrong with me or my candidacy.\n\nObviously I'm going to keep applying and not stop.  I don't need people to tell me that.

For most of my life I was just a pretty normal guy with mild social anxiety, and I never really had any success in life. I was never the smartest, funniest, good looking, well of person, etc. But thing started to change when I was 24 when I some how made a huge career move and got a promotion making me in charge of 25 people on a daily basis all of whom are older than me and most have more experience in the Industry than me. Now I make just shy of 6 figures and was able to buy a very nice house for the part of the country I live in. Despite all of this I feel like an imposter, I feel uncomfortable with my success, I feel undeserving, I wake up in the middle of my night with my heart racing wondering when I will be found out as undeserving of everything I have, and be knocked down to where I belong. I have worked hard for what I have, working terrible shifts, making sacrifices, always striving to be the best I can, taking away time from my family to complete an MBA, but I am still filled with dread. \n\nTL;DR why do I feel such anxiety about something that should make me happy?  Maybe sometime lingering from my childhood when I would always hear my parents arguing about money?\n\nSorry For the rambling thoughts. ",

            "selftext": "TL;DR at the bottom.\n\nI developed GAD, SAD, and Depression when I was 13 but wasn't diagnosed until I was 19. I've been in and out of therapy and on and off medication since then. I would say that I've made a lot of progress but lately I've experienced a sharp decline.\n\nMy problem is that I have a shitty job. I'm a librarian so that means I wasted actual money on this. But to get straight to the problem, I hate this place. My boss is a people-pleaser which means she never stands up to aggressive employees, and she can never say no to a patron. Which means *I* can never say no. She says I can but let's be real, there are times when I'd rather say no that she gently pushes me into anyways.\n\nI am the only employee to have been written up for poor performance. This occurred after just 5 months here. I had rolled into a library with so many ongoing programs, groups, book orders, audiobook orders, etc. and so many expectations that I'd need a goddamn Time-Turner to get through the week.\n\nI am not the only one who makes mistakes. I am just the only one called out for it. I am also the only one who can work her ass off and *still* not get any recognition for it. There's a negative report sitting in my file but not a single positive one. My boss only bothered to review me when I had made a mistake and she put a lot of effort into it, too. Normally, this woman answers fewer than 50% of the emails I send her but when it was time to lay on the shit, that woman typed up 3+ paragraphs based on second-hand accounts. I emailed her back to correct her, and again corrected her in person the next day, yet she didn't amend the report and had me sign it - a one-sided account of my failings, without my corrections, answers, or explanations. I haven't received a review since then. It's been 7 months.\n\nI also work with a team comprised of only women. I wish someone would bring up a discrimination suit because there's not a single male or non-white person here and let me tell you - diversity isn't just some social/political agenda, it's what makes life *bearable*. I don't fit in here and I do try but in some cases, I have been actively excluded on purpose.\n\nMy job has been tainted ever since that write up. It was the first thing that really highlighted for me how much scrutiny I, and only I, am under. Repeated examples of this have only made it worse. Having had no vacation time in almost a year has worn me down, I can't even take a breath.\n\nI am frequently angry. I've had two random, unexplained anxiety attacks in the past two weeks. I'm either stressed at work or stressed about going back. I have resorted to drinking several times a week. I cleared nearly two bottles of wine Tuesday night. I knocked out half a bottle of whiskey over the weekend. It's fast becoming a problem. I'm medicated but I'm on something that is only meant to help control the anxiety, but not totally eliminate it; my therapist's concern is that something stronger would interfere with my ability to complete daily tasks.\n\nI do look for other jobs but none have opened up. Even if one did, I am now fearful that this is just what my life will be until my debt is paid off; after all, I could be jumping out of the frying pan and into the fire. Without any stronger medication, I don't know what to do or expect. I can't just leave librarianship, my financial plans hinge on making it through the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program.\n\n*What do you do when you are this miserable?*\n\n**TL;DR** My job sucks. I've been here for nearly a year, I've tried to make it work, but I receive more pressure and more shit than anyone else and absolutely no recognition. I'm the punching bag and I'm fucking miserable. No new job openings available yet.",

            "selftext": "I don't know if anyone else feels like this but I've been struggling with this since I was like 12/13 years old (I'm 20 now).\n\nI basically always feel like time is slipping away from me. For example, if I have a free day, from the moment I get up I already feel like the day is already over. I know it doesn't make any sense but I feel like time goes by too quickly, the next day comes too quickly and I'll have to face people again.\n\nOther example, and this started when I was around 13. Before going to sleep I always had this restless feeling, like tomorrow is going to be here too quickly. I wanted to draw out my days so I went to bed pretty late (for a 13 year old..) and I would put alarms in the middle of the night just to get a little more time for myself before going to school again. I still do that more often than not. \n\nI don't know how to explain exactly but it's awful. Like right now it's 9PM and I have to get up early tomorrow and I now I'll have to get to bed at a reasonable time. And that's what makes me anxious. I just want to have more hours of today before having to go to sleep. Even if I still have 3 hours left, my mind just wants more. Do I make sense ?? ",
