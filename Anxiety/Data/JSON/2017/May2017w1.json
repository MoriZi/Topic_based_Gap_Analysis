            "selftext": "I feel like everything that's slightly out of my comfort zone is obsessively worrisome. Not that I avoid going after what scares me, but I have such a bad habit of negative thinking after every positive accomplishment I make. I try to combat it, but it is pretty much my natural mode of thinking. It's really easy to constantly feel stressed and worried, and it's gotten to the point where I get headaches and by the end of the day I get dizzy and nauseus. \n\nFor example, when I was applying for jobs, I got really scared I was just never going to hear back from anybody. My self-esteem plummeted even though I should've just been happy I was applying.\nThen, when I got an interview, I panicked and kept worrying I wouldn't get the job.\nTHEN, after I got the offer, I kept worrying that I'd do a bad job, that I'm an imposter. To this day I keep imagining myself failing.\nAfter that, I would compare myself to other people's accomplishments, thinking, \"wow my job isn't as cool as ____ or ____.\"\nAlso, it's my last semester in school and I'm worried that I won't complete the semester well and that I'm just worthless. \n\nEvery night recently before falling asleep I find myself pitying myself and feeling horrible and worthless. My boyfriend said the other day that if I just made the decision to be happier for myself, things would be a lot less frustrating for me. I got pretty pissed off at that comment as if changing was as easy as a switch - I feel like this kind of anxiety is incredibly hard to change due to having had this habit since I was young.\n\nI feel like I do this because my mind is trying to prepare for the worst possible scenario and emotionally \"prepare\" for failure - to expect it, in a sense. I used to be really insecure growing up and quickly picked up perfectionist tendencies...and it doesn't help that I'm already a sensitive person. I thought I've gotten better but because of all the change that's happening in my life, my worries have amplified. I've always feared leaving college - it has felt like a safety net for the past four years. ",

I've lost all motivation, I don't have a job, my school grades are going down. On top of all that the only people who can comfort me (my parents) are gone on vacation for a week and they only think Im having depression issues because I have problems with explaining in detail what's really going on to them. They did contact someone about a therapy session before they left but who knows how longs it's going to be till I get in. On top of all that I have to get my wisdom teeth removed and I'm extremely terrified of getting high from drugs so I've been avoiding making an appointment. Basically my life is in a downward spiral. All this stress is putting me on the edge. I've been speaking up to family members more, being rude at times, and normally I'm a very polite keep to myself kind of guy. I feel like it's going to get worse and I'm terrified of my future. Anyway I don't know if anyone's going to read this because it's so long but I just had to get that off my chest.

I feel guilty for mistakes at work to a point where I feel not worth doing anything for myself. When something gors wrong I always assume it's my fault. I am often proved wrong later but it doesn't teach me anything. I just feel worthless. I can't focus on a book or even be fully present in the moment while having sex.",

At the beginning of the year, I was weaning off of Lexapro, which had wild effects on my brain. A couple weeks later, I was diagnosed with major depression, and along with that came every one of its symptoms.\n\nAcademically, this has been the hardest semester thusfar. I'm on track to get a C on my transcript for the first time ever, which is a major disappointment to me.\n\nI have two jobs and both of them have put me under major stress. One is brand new and has been stressful in that respect. The other is an older job where I feel obligated to keep up a certain level of over the top job performance.\n\nAll of my friends and my long distance SO have been having major life events and have been less able to support me through this time, which has been really hard.\n\nI want nothing more to drop out and go home and do nothing forever. Realistically, I know no one is disappointed in me but me, but I'm just so upset and having such a hard time that it feels like everyone else is disappointed to.\n\nI just need some words of encouragement. I feel awful.\n\nThanks. ",
