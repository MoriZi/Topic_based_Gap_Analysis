I am super thankful that I have to be at work very early in the mornings or I would spend all morning thinking, \"four hours till work, three hours, two, half an hour,\" . \nBut on my days off, when I wake up in the morning, my mind immediately starts spinning with all the things I need to get done that day and, \"have I forgotten anything? Will I be able to get to the post office and back in time for that appointment? Should I write this down so I don't forget? But what if because I write it down, I take too much time and won't be able to go to the grocery store as well?\" \n\nAnd on top of that, there is a layer of guilt, \"Is this a good use of my time? Is this the best use of my money? Am I being productive enough? Am I doing enough for my boyfriend as well? Am I spending too much time inside? Am I exercising enough? Am I spending too much time online? Am I talking to my family enough? Do people think of me as inconsiderate?\" \n\nAnd then, of course, there's the looming feeling of, my weekend is slowly drawing to a close, the clock is ticking and in 24 hours I'll be getting up for work, twelve hours, six hours, am I going to get enough sleep, five hours, and then, the cycle starts over. I don't even dislike my job, it is very fast-paced and sometimes stressful with difficult social interactions (hotel front desk), but overall it's enjoyable. I just feel like the time that I have to myself isn't really MY time because it's consumed by all of these horrible feelings of anxiety, guilt, and self-doubt. \n\nI'm sure I'm not alone in this, if anyone has any tips on what I can do to ease this, it would be greatly appreciated. I enjoy yoga &amp; sometimes meditation, and I have a feeling that they would help a lot, but lately they keep falling into the \"not a good enough use of my time\" category. I feel like I used to have so much more time! It seems impossible that days are still 24 hours long. \n\nAny advice is much appreciated, PMs too. Thank you. I hope you are feeling fine &lt;3 ",

To get to university I have to get a bus into the city centre, walk to the train station and then get the train to university.  I go to university most days so this journey ruins my mood almost everyday.\n\nThe thing is, I understand that most people get angry by slow walkers, people who get off an escalator and then come to a sudden stop right at the bottom, people who decide to count out pennies at the checkout etc. but these things make me extremely, irrationally angry. I\u2019m guessing this is down to my anxiety but the way people act in public makes me so much more angry than it should. I mean angry to the point where I\u2019m clenching my fists or biting my fingers really hard to let out the frustration. Even things like people laughing too loud on the train cause this internal rage. \n\nI know I\u2019m making myself sound like such a dick but I don\u2019t understand why people in public make me this angry. It gets to the point where by the time I get home I am in such a foul mood. I\u2019ve tried just relaxing but I honestly feel like I can\u2019t.\n\nI live in Birmingham, UK and the centre is always busy and, for example, there are a lot of tourists who will just abruptly stop and take pictures in busy areas. I get that tourists want to take pictures but at the same time I\u2019m getting this automatic physical feeling of rage. It\u2019s like I\u2019m battling between my conscious thought of \u201cthis isn\u2019t that much of a big deal and you shouldn\u2019t be angry\u201d and the automatic response of pure rage. I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s because I just want to get home and people like this are hindering that.\n\nI know this post seems so pathetic and all over the place but I just don\u2019t understand why these little things are enough to put me in such a bad mood. Has anyone else experienced this and have any idea about how I can stop feeling like this? ",

Thinking, if they wanted to hang out they would let me know. \n\nI said \"No\" to a girl who asked me to the ball; not because I don't like her, but because I didn't think I would be a good date, and I'll ruin her night. Then I awful about saying no. Worry that I might have hurt her and she's upset.\n\nThese are all things that have taken place in the last year or so. I hate that my anxiety controls my decisions so much, causing me to miss opportunities because of my irrational fears. \n\n\nEdit: Wow! This is really cool that so many people saw my post and related in the comments. It's nice to know I'm not alone. Thank you! And to think, I nearly deleted this post 10 mins after posting because I didn't think anyone would care. Thanks again!",

I'm wondering if this is a rare thing or if other people also have to deal with it. I don't take any medication so I'm not sure if meds would help tremors or make them worse but the doctors have reassured me its nothing neurological and that I'll be okay. I have \"good\" days and \"bad\" days where basically I'm more susceptible to tremors if I've had a lot of caffeine, sugar, alcohol, or just plain nervous with none of the above I guess. \n\nEdit: thanks kind stranger for the gold!

As the day went on I became very tired (also the last week has been extremely stressful) and the more tired I got, the more anxious I got, and the more anxious I got, the worse my stomach felt. I started getting anxious about my stomach which made my stomach feel worse, which made my anxiety worse.\n\nI need sleep, but I\u2019m in pain and I\u2019m so anxious that I can barely even sit still long enough to type this, let alone go to bed. I\u2019m so panicky, I\u2019m tempted to call my mom and wake her up but it doesn\u2019t seem fair to do that.

            "selftext": "I swear I\u2019ve had crippling anxiety since I was 4 or 5 years old. I can clearly remember constantly worrying about my parents every single day. if one of them was 5 minutes later than usual I would immediately worry and convince myself that they\u2019d died in a car crash or some tragic accident. I was especially attached to my mom, and I would have panic attack-like episodes of intense crying and shaking when she was at work late. I would also have bad anxiety about my health, would often convince myself that I was gonna suddenly die of some sort of disease, which is something a 5 yr old definitely shouldn\u2019t be worried about. \nI also was super shy and pretty much didn\u2019t talk to anyone at school apart from this one girl who was my best friend up until recently. I would sit with her at the swings on the playground, at the exact same swing in the exact same spot every day for three years because I was terrified of change. I was so shy that I wouldn\u2019t even say more than a few words even to family members like aunts, uncles and grandparents. The only people I interacted normally with were my parents and my one friend. \nI didn\u2019t get formally diagnosed with anxiety until I was 13. I\u2019m 17 now and still the same anxious person, although I\u2019ve definitely  gotten better. I think anxiety is just a part of my personality that I was born with, since I had it at such a young age. Also should add that I really had no trauma in my childhood; I have a good life in general. I really just think I was born with anxiety. \nCan anyone else relate to this? \nPS-sorry for the super long post!!",

I also don't know if other people would even believe I have it. Or that it exists at all.\n\n**So when I realize that my symptoms are really there, or have someone else point it out to me, I feel so much better.** Like if I can treat the anxiety then maybe I could be so much better off someday. My mom confirmed that she knew I had anxiety even when I was super little. It made me feel so good to know it was real even back then.\n\nAs a kiddo I was always worried about accidentally lying (i.e. saying I would be at gymnastics, and then some unforeseeable event would happen and I wouldn't be), had tummy aches during school all the time, cried to the point of hyperventilation often, was triggered by scary or disturbing movies or news, was \"worried\" about so many little things. It wasn't normal for a little five year old to be thinking about stuff like that, and that's nice to know.\n\nI'm still struggling with anxiety as a 25 year old, but it looks different now. It's teeth grinding, heart palpitations, digestion issues, occasional hyperventilation and crying, intrusive thoughts, ears ringing, rumination, etc. Even when I have good days, it doesn't disprove that I have GAD.\n\nRegardless, I am who I am, and I love who I am. Even if I have GAD I am still going to live my life and use that knowledge to live my life even better.\n\nDoes anyone else struggle to accept or believe their diagnosis and feel like you have to prove it is real?\n\nEdit: Thanks for your responses! I've read each and every one of them, and all of them make me feel like I've found the right place to be and that I'm not an impostor on this sub :) While I am very sorry that you all have to deal with this thing, I am so glad that we have others to share our experiences with and come to deeper understanding.",

It's a symptom of overbreathing. No one in my life has talked about it. Air hunger is the sensation of being unable to take a satisfying breath no matter how deep you breath. It's caused by not having enough CO2 in your blood which is caused by hyperventilating (overbreathing). But also from breathing too deeply. (Also overbreathing) I have essentially forgotten how to breathe normally. I have to think of how i breath all the time. Otherwise i breath way too fast and shallow. Or i forget to breath then take a huge breath to compensate. All while feeling really anxious. The crazy thing about hyperventilating is that its caused by anxiety or stress, but hyperventilating also causes MORE anxiety. \n\nBefore i knew what air hunger was i followed general anxiety deep breathing excercises, but they didn't feel right, they made me feel worse. They explained why that is in the article i linked. It's essentially that breathing too deep can have the same effect as hyperventilating. They explain everything from why it happens and what happens in the body and also how to do breathing excercises that works for this kind of anxiety. I really recommend reading it. If you find that your anxiety is because of overbreathing then deep breathing excercises are not for you. ",
