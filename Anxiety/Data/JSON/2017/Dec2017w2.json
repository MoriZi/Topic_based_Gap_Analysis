Scared of getting outside? Go outside every day. Scared of making social interactions? Push your comfort levels. On day 1 you ask for a product in the supermarkt. On day 2 you ask someone the time etc. On day 60 you go skydiving. \n\n**Eat** healthy. Seriously, this one is huge. Research what is healthy for the human brain.\n\n**Exercise**\n\n**Don't** hide. Don't feel like a victim. Millions of people are struggling and you happen to be one, go and do something about it!\n\nRealize that anxiety can be **cured**. The reason you don't hear about it a lot is because people who cured their anxiety just go on with life. They don't go on these platforms anymore. I promised I would post here if I beat my anxiety. \n\nYou will feel more anxious taking action, because you are leaving your comfort zone. Your brain is only thinking about surviving and your survival brain is just fine laying in bed all day. Don't give up. First weeks will be very tough. This is because you're making changes. \n\nFinally, don't take life too serious. This mindset helped me a lot!\n\nGood luck on your journey. The time is now. \n\n\nEdit: So this became sort of popular. I will reply to every comment tomorrow, i have a party atm.",

I continued shaking more and more the further i got in the presentation. Then when i was a little less than halfway through i couldn\u2019t anymore. I broke down. I started crying and couldn\u2019t stop again. I embarrassed myself in front of my class. My teacher made me leave the room so i could calm down and send my best friend with me. Then after a few minutes i got back into the class. I was still feeling horrible. My teacher luckily didn\u2019t make me continue my presentation. \nThen a little later in that class my teacher came down to me and said that she would talk to my main teacher about it and my parents. \n\nIt sucks bc i have to have exams later this year and next year and I\u2019m normally quite good in school but i just can\u2019t do presentations or tests. Every time we have to do a test i get a really bad stomachache and feel like I\u2019m about to throw up. Another time when i was doing a presentation in English i was about to faint. I couldn\u2019t see my paper and i was shaking so much..\n\nThanks if you took the time to read this. It means a lot. I really just needed to tell someone about it and reddit seemed like a good place to get it out.",

It started when I was a little kid, and was probably unnecessary at the time, but my parents went overboard.  Before long, kids at school were asking me if I was crazy, asking me \"Doesn't psychologist have the word psycho in it?\"\n\nI can't tell if my low self esteem and anxiety is the result of some genetic chemical imbalance in my brain, or if it's something I could eventually overcome, caused by childhood trauma.  It's impossible to say. I was bullied a lot as a kid, dealt with issues with my parents (they are great people but they made mistakes) and was repeatedly sexually assaulted by my first boyfriend in middle school.  So who really knows what's wrong with me?  Was I born insane, or did I just turn out this way?\n\nI know I'm better than I used to be.  My OCD used to be in full force and I couldn't do anything without performing rituals.  Now, it's just straight up anxiety and low self esteem.  But I'm so annoyed that I have to be this way.  \n\nAmong friends and coworkers, I proudly identify as having anxiety because to me, that's easier than hiding it.  I even joke about it.  I told a friend yesterday \"I don't think I could hang out with someone who wasn't open to therapy, because either you're not self aware enough to get help, or you're not interesting enough to be mentally ill.\"  (obviously, a joke.)  I am a successful creative professional and multiple people in my life (including my therapist) have told me that my creativity and intelligence are directly tied to my mental issues- that the most talented people are often disturbed in some way, that it's a \"gift.\"  \n\nBut damn if I didn't just want to be normal sometimes.  I am not trying to sound like I'm /r/iamverysmart material, by the way.  But it blows.  I hate how emotional I get over fucking everything.  But IDK if I would give up my talents to lose this curse.

            "selftext": "So about three months ago I was diagnosed as anxiety/depressed. Normal typical combo. I have meds, yea, and they work sometimes, but not really. I\u2019m not suicidal, I\u2019m just upset at myself. My life is good and I have no fuxking reason to be depressed or anxious. But, here I am.\n\nMy depression is pretty bad, if I\u2019m honest. It\u2019s hard to get out of bed, to remember to do basic things like brush my teeth or shower. I hate doing my hobbies (cooking, makeup, working out, gaming). It\u2019s not nearly as bad as my mother\u2019s, and again I have no right to have it for as long as I have (going on 8 years. Mom chose to ignore it)\n\nMy anxiety is the worst part of it. I can\u2019t take phone calls. I hate talking to anyone (this includes my fianc\u00e9 and our roommate). I hate small talk. I hate interviews. I am terrified of anyone I have to respect and the wrong things come out of my mouth (my last job I was fired for making an off comment to a manager who I tried to apologize for, as when I\u2019m nervous my mouth explodes). I can\u2019t ask people for help ever, and if I do it takes me ages to work up courage. It takes me three days to get back to calls for jobs (because thankfully online applications are a thing). I get these horrible panic attacks monthly, where my entire body numbs up and I can\u2019t move. I can\u2019t sleep at night scolding myself. I am terrified of being robbed so any little sound keeps me ticking.\n\nOn top of all of this I\u2019m almost certain my eating disorder has come back. I apparently make these wonderful meals (though I\u2019m certain they are only saying it to try and make me feel better) but I can\u2019t eat them. I haven\u2019t fully finished a meal in three years. I eat a meal a day (but if it\u2019s something I love like pizza I get the calories I need). I haven\u2019t gone back to the puking, but I\u2019m really worried.\n\nMy mother in law scolds me for not doing basic shit that a human should remember to do. My mom still refuses to believe it\u2019s as bad as I think it is. I avoid talking to anyone about it because I can\u2019t trust anyone. Its because it\u2019s what I expect them to say. \n\nI can\u2019t afford therapy. I have insurance but I don\u2019t have a job. My fianc\u00e9 does but all of it goes to our bills. I can\u2019t ask my family to help because they are in just a bad situation as me. I can\u2019t drive, I can\u2019t find a damn job due to the stress and the time of year that it is. I\u2019m terrified, and I don\u2019t know what to do anymore.\n\nI just needed to vent it out. I don\u2019t expect anyone to say anything. Infact I hope this to just get flooded away. Even if someone does respond I probably won\u2019t respond back. I hate burdening others, especially when some of you probably have it worse off than me.",

            "selftext": "I\u2019ve sought therapy to treat my anxiety for the last 7 years or so. Most recently I saw a therapist who I resonated with and I felt helped put me on the path to helping me manage my anxiety, She prefaced the very first session with the notion that I will never truly be free of anxiety which is OK, it is a part of who I am, but I can learn to manage it. And that is what I set out to do (which for me was a new outlook / way of approaching my anxiety).\n\nAs the sessions progressed I made notes of the key takeaways which I have sought to incrementally embed in my daily life. I now refer to this list almost daily. \n\nWhat I\u2019ve learned in my sessions (these are taken from the notes I\u2019ve jotted down in my phone):\n\n1. I can re-wire my brain to change my inner belief system. It takes time, but I am making progress. \n\n2. CBT is effective to put things into perspective. It helps rationalize and observe the situation. \n\n3. What is the worst thing that can happen in any situation? Think of it, define it and realize it's not that bad.\n\n4. My mind, thoughts and perception of a situation are the problem - not the person or situation itself. Someone else in the exact same situation would perceive and react differently based on their own perceptions.\n\n5. Progress is based on small incremental improvements through various tools and exercises such as hypnosis, meditation, CBT and exposure. Like a jigsaw, all the pieces come together and I can effectively tackle my anxiety. \n\n6. A 'so what' attitude is the attitude to have. So what if I fail, so what if something goes wrong? So what!?\n\n7. I can embrace my awkwardness. Laugh at it and myself - don't take anxiety so seriously, no one else around me does. \n\n8. I don't judge anyone else so harshly, so I shouldn't judge myself so harshly. If I see someone awkward or anxious I am empathetic - I don't negatively judge them. So why do I judge myself, and why would anyone judge me. Don't be so critical of myself or hold myself to a higher standard.\n\n9. My inner dialogue defines my reality. Think positive, and be positive. Think confident, act confident and be confident. \n\n10. Setting exposure goals and tracking them helps. \n\n11. Writing thoughts and progress down helps solidify it in my mind. \n\n12. Even when I have a bad day - don't be harsh - I am making progress. \n\n13. If I diet for 3 weeks then binge one day. I haven't lost all progress for the other 20 days where I ate healthy. The same applies for anxiety. One bad experience does not negate the progress I have made.\n\n14. Each day I am moving forward and improving.\n\n15. Meditation is like weight loss. It's takes time to notice the work you've put in before you see results. Don't be disheartened and persevere. Each day I am improving. \n\n16. As I improve, I notice I am more observant of my thoughts. When I have a thought which provokes a negative reaction (i.e a knot in my stomach) I catch myself questioning the thought and whether it is rationale in the context of the situation. I then stop (or attempt to stop) my thought and replace it with a more reasonable and rationale thought. This doesn't happen every time - I still go into autopilot from time to time, but I find more and more I am becoming more observant and intercepting my negative thoughts on a more regular basis.\n\nMy sessions have since ended, but I still go back and add to this list from time to time. Perhaps in sharing my list, it may be of benefit to someone else. ",
