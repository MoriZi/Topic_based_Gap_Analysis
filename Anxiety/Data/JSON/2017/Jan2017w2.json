I don't even know what it feels like to want. My mom always made decisions for me as a child and even told me what kinds of food I liked and didn't like... I never really got to make those decisions for myself and I think because of that I don't really have a strong identity or strong sense of self... I'm very co-dependent and afraid to stand up for myself in any sort of situation... like my job which treats me like shit.

            "selftext": "Here's my story. I apologize that it's long but thank you to anyone who takes the time to read it and offer me advice.\n\n\nWhen I was younger, I suffered from crippling social anxiety to the point that I couldn't even interact with cashiers in stores. In high school I ended up in a very toxic relationship where I became desperate to better myself in order to save it. In the process, I put myself into countless situations where I was out of my comfort zone and after around 7 years, I managed to mostly overcome my social anxiety. I'm at the point now where I have realized that I am just an introvert and being around people for too long makes me feel exhausted and depressed but I like myself now so I don't feel anxiety anymore over what they might think of me. It's more just like I run out of steam and want to go home and sleep.\n\n\nWhat I really enjoy doing is learning. I have lots of hobbies and things that I want to learn to do. I like sports, crafting, reading, etc. When I have spare time, I never get bored but I never feel like I have enough time to do the things I want to do. I have lots of projects and goals in mind which I have been slowly working away at anytime I'm off work but this is part of what is causing my anxiety.\n\n\nI graduated university last year with an engineering degree and was fortunate enough to find a job only 3 months after graduation. Most people would have been thrilled but for me this is when the anxiety started up again. All through university, I felt okay and only had minor worries when I thought about my growing student debt but figured it would all be okay once I graduated and got a job. In reality, in the days leading up to the start of my job, I felt like I was slowly being strangled and it got harder and harder to sleep at night.\n\n\nOnce I actually started working, it seemed okay at first. Things were new and exciting and I had a nice office in a tall building downtown, but it didn't take long for the anxiety to come back. My job itself is okay. The pay is good for someone just out of school but still doesn't go far in the city I'm in. One thing that stresses me out a lot is that I have received very little training so far; I just get thrown into things and expected to figure them out. It's okay but I don't feel like I'm becoming a very good engineer this way. I feel like I'm just fumbling around in the dark and barely finding my way.\n\n\nSomehow I just can't come to terms with the idea of working for the rest of my life. Right now I'm in a position where my contract needs to be renewed each year and a big part of me is hoping it doesn't get renewed. But on the other hand, I have about $30k in student debt to pay off so I have to keep working. Almost my entire paycheque goes to paying this off but it will still take about 2 years of working. This makes me feel so hopeless and depressed. It is already such a struggle to come in to work each day and it feels like I'm fighting such a battle just to get back to neutral. I really don't want to leave the city I'm in but the housing market is so messed up that buying a place anytime in the next 5 years will likely be impossible for me.\n\n\nI was recently sick for a week and I was in so much pain, all I could do was lay in bed and stare at the ceiling but I felt so much relief knowing that I didn't have to go in to work. I felt so happy but as soon as my condition started improving, the anxiety came back full force.\n\n\nI work slightly longer days in order to have a 3-day weekend every other week. Even on these longer weekends, I spend most of the time just wanting to do activities that won't make time feel like it's passing too quickly. I try to have a fighting spirit and just do the things I want to do anyway but then I end up feeling really depressed after once I realize how much time has gone by and now it's closer to work.\n\n\nI'm trying to plan a trip for the summer to give myself some motivation to go to work but no matter how I were to plan it, 1 week off, 2 weeks off, 1 month off (I get 3 weeks vacation per year but I saved 2 weeks from last year so they could roll over), coming back to work afterwards is inevitable. There is that hopeless feeling of impending doom. Time flies when you're having fun and then the thing you've been planning for months is over.\n\n\nI also have this horrible feeling that, time is wasting and I'm not spending enough of it with my parents and siblings. I keep getting irrational thoughts and feel really freaked out that I'm not gonna get to spend enough time with them. Just writing this is making me feel so panicked.\n\n\nI've never wanted to be rich, my goal has always been to make enough that my family can live comfortably. I've been trying to think of jobs I can work towards where I can work 3 days a week or work from home some days. I have always wanted to have kids one day and to be at home to raise them until they're old enough to go to school. I feel like I chose the wrong degree and, although I would be happy to go back to school and pursue another path, it's just not financially feasible at this point and who's to say I wouldn't just end up back here.\n\n\nI constantly tell myself that I'm acting so spoiled. I am fortunate that I am in a position to even pay my loans off. People I went to school with, smarter than me with higher GPAs, are still struggling to find jobs. I am lucky to be educated and living in a good city. I have a nice office. I have friends and family who love me. I have things in life that I enjoy and bring me happiness. For months now, during my commute to work, I repeat these things in my head over and over again and remind myself how spoiled I'm acting and how I should be happy/thankful. But still, it doesn't seem to help and every morning, it is such a struggle just to get out of bed. The thing that gives me the extra push each day is that I come from a poor family and my parents have worked so hard to support me that I have to succeed. I feel so miserable and hopeless though that I don't know what to do. I'm not sure how to change my mindset. This thought process isn't working so what should I be telling myself. Should I seek help from a therapist? I feel like my life is rushing past me and it terrifies me.\n\nEven just writing that out was a bit therapeutic. Thanks for reading and thanks in advance if you have any advice.",

            "selftext": "I really needed to get this off my chest, but I want to preface this that Lexapro really helped change my life around (along with therapy), so I don't want to discourage others from avoiding SSRIs, but not keeping good track of my pills must've led me to having a second pill last night.  I think taking the pill on an empty stomach and without much water contributed to it as well.\n\nIt was really disturbing.  I take 20mg pills.  Besides having a bizarre dream, I woke up in my bed, and it felt like my face was being dissolved away by acid and numb.  I had to keep feeling it to assure myself that my face was still there.  At times, I couldn't help but chuckle out loud to myself or smile really wide.  My thoughts were looping and repeating very strongly.  \n\nThis morning I woke up, and felt more or less back to normal, but I'm finding myself more irritable and emotional than usual.  It was so bizarre.\n\nThis is mostly a reminder to myself to use the pill box I purchased awhile ago rather than just taking pills straight from the bottle.  I just felt like I needed to get this out there somewhere, somehow.  \n\nUPDATE 02/02/17:  If you're like me, you obsessively search forums like this one, so I thought I'd post what happened since then.  It took me awhile to find a psychiatrist that was accepting patients, but I finally saw one yesterday.  In regards to the strange symptoms I had as a result of taking the 2nd pill by accident, she said that \"since 20mg is already the max dose of Lexapro, taking 40mg could produce psychotic symptoms.\"  In other words, my symptoms were normal.  She decided to switch me to Effexor 37.5mg since I still have panic attacks every 6 months or so and general high worry while on the max dosage of Lexparo.  She also said that Lexapro's beneficial effects could disappear after a couple years as your body builds resistance to it, but that if I was off Lexapro for say 10 years, the Lexapro could be beneficial again.  I'll be picking up the Effexor prescription today.",

The salary is not super high, but it can get me by until I start making commission (that's what I'm really after). \n\nOn the days I feel confident, I look at all the seasoned employees and think to myself \"I'm 1000x smarter than these guys, I just need the industry knowledge, and I can be where they're at no problem\" Now these guys are all making over $100k per year, some over 500k. These type of days are very motivating. \n\nThe other days, I'm afraid I'll fail for one reason or another. Whether it's that I get really unlucky and am unable to grow my customer base quick enough (unfortunately sales job are 80% skill, 20% luck imo). Or that I end up being disliked by my coworkers so much that I get let go. I already don't fit in well with the general personality type of everyone at work. I'm more of an intellectual, and I use logic, extensive knowledge,  and a convincing voice to sell products. It works very well but it clashes with others because they suggest I'm over thinking things. Which is probably true, but nonetheless, my method has proven successful time and time again. Also, I like to ask a lot of questions when I'm learning something new, and I'm noticing that people are getting a little annoyed with that. I think it's mainly because everyone is always stressed out from what I can see. This is because sales is quite stressful. \n\nEither way, I'm to the point where I almost want to say something to my boss. I want to tell him my concerns in such a way where he sees that I want to combat my non-confident side and strengthen my confident side. Anyone have advice on this? It's causing me so much anxiety that I literally have nightmares about it that cause me to wake up in the middle of the night. I need help with this. \n\nTL;DR Started a new job, having anxiety about failing, having even more anxiety about my coworkers not liking me, almost wanna tell my boss, please help. \n\nEDIT: First of all, this is my first time getting a decent amount of upvotes (I know 80 isn't a lot, but it's my record so far). But more importantly, thank you all so much for your advice. I'm starting to realize that it's pretty normal to feel the way I do about my new job. I think it's just a matter of getting assimilated and comfortable. Also I'm sorry for not responding to everyone's comments. I've been very anxious about other things and have been neglecting lots of things.  I am feeling a lot better just by reading what you guys have to say, and please if anyone has input, please keep it coming. I will make an effort to respond to everyone. ",

That was also when I started my CBT. What was the hardest, though, was that around the same time, my sister-in-law, whom I'm very close with, tried to commit suicide from depression. She was the one that taught me to listen to the actual lyrics of the songs, rather than just \"plain listening\", and ever since I've loved music even more.\n\nTo deal with this, and my anxiety and stress, I began to make a playlist, partly for my own sake and partly for hers, with songs that would tell me (us) that it's okay, just breathe, things will get better even if it sucks now, just be who you are, nothing is wrong with you (I've tried to find lists like this before, but not found what I was looking for, as most other lists I've found are more.. cheerful). I shared it with her, and she's contributed to some of the songs, and likes it a lot. I've also shared it with a few close friends, including my best friend who is going through an incredibly tough time as well, and both she and I listen to this list daily now, to unwind and calm down when we're in stressful situations and/or having anxiety/panic attacks. This list has been building the past year, and I find it helping me more and more, and the past weeks I've wanted to share it with you here (due to my anxiety it's taken me this long, though). Some are songs I've found people mentioning here, and some are songs I've found by myself, or on google.\n\n[Comforting Songs playlist by Akazukin \\(Spotify\\)](https://open.spotify.com/user/akazukin/playlist/2eElBbZJwr1d65HfxkjpXS).\n\nIf you find music helping you, feel free to listen or follow it if you want. Take whatever songs you like into your own playlist, break it apart, make it yours. If a song in this list can help anyone here even a fragment of how much it's been helping me cope through the past year, that's more than I could ever ask for.\n\n_(A few (like 2-3) of the songs are in Swedish, but there are translations available on Google for those that like them.)_\n\n\nEdit: If you know a song that you think would fit, feel free to comment and/or PM it to me and I can check it out.",

I had only recently tried to be more social as that was what I'd constantly heard from my therapist and my family. The more I try to become social, the more I feel like I should just be alone. I'm always a little much, giving too much attention to people and pushing them away or just feeling the urge to leave, myself. \n\nI don't know, I felt a little more content, less vulnerable when I was by myself and maybe I should just keep it that way.

            "selftext": "Hi guys. I was diagnosed with anxiety about 6 months ago, but from talking with my therapist it may go back beyond 10 years. It has gotten a lot worse recently after the breakdown of a relationship and stress at work. I've been doing CBT for a few months now, and also doing some meditation at home. However, after the last couple of weeks I called my doctor and he has recommended some medication  (Citalopram). \nThe thing is,  this terrifies me. Like it confirms I have something wrong and I clearly can't handle it/fix it alone. It feels like a last resort, and if it helps then I'll be on it forever. I'm also worried that I'll never know if it does work because my issues stem so far back in my life. Anyone else have these feelings? Any advice from like minded individuals....\n\nEdit: I've been reading the responses and thinking somewhat. I think some of my nerves around the medication is because I feel like I don't fit the mould of anxiety with a lot of those out there. I don't have trouble leaving the house or doing things etc, but all of my anxiety is locked up inside myself and I let none of it out. I think because of this my Doctor hasn't been brilliant and when he suggested medication he was far from convincing that this is the best course of action. \n\nObviously I'm having trouble admitting that I have a problem at all, even though it's been confirmed by doctor and therapist, and I think that's why I feel medication is finally confirming this.\n\nAnyway, I feel like I'm going in circles. So, guys, thank you. Seriously. All the time you've all taken to respond has not gone unnoticed. I've done my best to respond to each of you and offer my thanks. I'll be re-reading and using all of your advice over the coming weeks as I take on this next step in sorting myself out. ",
