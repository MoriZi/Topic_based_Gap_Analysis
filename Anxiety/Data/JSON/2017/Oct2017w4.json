This anxiety issue has been following me around pretty much my entire life.  I guess for a while I thought these were just normal feelings.  As life started to get more complicated with marriage, work, kids, etc..  I felt as if I was being consumed and couldn't get out from under the anxiety, if that makes sense.  Anyways, I'm just looking to connect with other people who have gone through this or are currently going through it.  I figure support is the best medicine right now.  I have an extremely supportive wife, but she doesn't suffer from anxiety like I do, so I figured it would be better to reach out to someone who knows what it's like.  PM me if you want to chat.

I'm irritable and can't ever get some sleep, I think I sleep 3-4 hours at a time, a couple times a day. I'll stay up until 4am, sleep until 8ish, and then after work take a nap from 8pm-11pm, rinse and repeat. \n\n\nEdit-- just want to say thank you to everybody who responded, I didn't expect to have this many people who feel the same way.

Due to a shortage in vitamin D i am in pain mostly 24/7. On meds now but today it\u2019s worse than ever. I am also supposed to get my period right now so that ain\u2019t helping... I also slept bad last night with very weird dreams and woke up without pants. \n\nThis has resulted in me not being able to sleep well because sleep terrifies me - because I am convinced I am going to die. (Going to a therapist next week, don\u2019t worry).\n\nEvery single time I was scared and told my boyfriend he was like \u201cI am coming your way and I am staying\u201d. EVERY SINGLE TIME NO MATTER WHAT.\n\nIt sucks to feel like this but at least with him around I can sleep. I love him so much and in four months time he has done more for me than any of my exes. \n\nDeer, I love you so so much \u2764\ufe0f",
