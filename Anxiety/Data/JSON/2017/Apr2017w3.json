I know I'm being irrational but I can't help the way I feel.\n\nIn a few days my university classes are going to start again and I was unsure about a few things regarding the timetable. Anyway, the obvious solution would lie in asking people who take the same classes, right?\n\nI had to force myself to text into a group chat with people that I'm friendly and never had a problem with. They're all nice and helpful. But since there were no classes, I didn't see them for a while.\n\n So when I attempted to text, I kept asking myself, 'what if they hate you, what if they only pretended to like you and they're annoyed by your questions, what if they don't reply and you're being too needy' etc.\n\nLogically, I know that these worries make no sense because these people have never done anything to indicate that they might feel this way about me. So, like usually, I bullied (motivated?) myself  into texting anyway. \n\nWhen they didn't text back immidiately (which, hello, is totally understandable because they're not available 24/7) I kept working myself up.\n\nI'm so done with myself because, in my head, I know these worries are senseless and that I'm being ridiculous, but I still can't help myself.\n\nThis problem extends into other parts of my life. I'd have to be in an extremely dire situation to ask for help from anyone, even from my best friends. I'm always worrying that I'm being a bother and that I'll be dumped for being too needy. \n\nDo some of you experience similiar issues and have you found something that helps you cope?",

I usually consider myself to be a really socially awkward person, but this has never happened to me before. I had to make a presentation with a partner and I made the grave mistake of partnering with my extremely extroverted friend. Two days later, we finish the project, and its time to present. I wasn't ready to present, so I started to think about what I should do, when suddenly, my friend volunteers to go first. I give her the \"what the hell?\" look and go up front. Since I was the one who sent my powerpoint to the teacher, he sees my name on it. My last name is \"Limon\", which means \"lime\" in Spanish. He sees it and tells me that I have a \"unique\" last name while the entire class laughs because of my last name. I immediately become red and laugh nervously. My friend presents her slides flawlessly, she doesn't even stutter. While she's presenting, I get this lump on my throat. Its my turn to present. I get sweaty on my hands and begin to present. I began to laugh really nervously and the class does the same. Those laughs suddenly become tears and I start crying while laughing at the same time. Obviously, my teacher notices this and lets me sit down. My friend finishes the rest of the slides and my teacher apologizes to me in private. I haven't fully recovered from my episode until I was halfway through my next period. This has never happened to me before. Usually, I get extremely nervous before a presentation but I put that behind me and get through it. I don't usually think that I have anxiety but sometimes I get second thoughts about it. Could this be an anxiety attack, or just some weird episode that I had?",

            "selftext": "You're going about your day and you start to notice a feeling of being just a little bit on edge. It starts somewhere inside your head. Maybe you feel a little bit of tension building in your chest or your face. \n\nYou try to ignore it, but think you know what's happening. Then your heart starts beating faster as you realize what it is. \n\nBreathing becomes a chore and you're panting for air before you know it. Breathing like a marathon runner, but it still feels like you're not getting enough air. \n\nAnother panic attack. \n\nLast year I was having them about twice a day. Even when the panic attacks calmed for a while, there was still an underlying feeling of always being on edge.  I just couldn't relax.\n\nIt got to the point where I was afraid to go outside. I barely left the house for months (except to go to work). I was afraid I'd have another panic attack in the car or at the grocery store.\n\nIt was miserable and terrifying. \n\nYou don't have to constantly suffer without help if you have persistent anxiety that's making life miserable. \n\nEventually I couldn't deal with it on my own anymore. Through some research and helpful therapists, I was able to find some ways to get my anxiety to a livable level. \n\nThere are dozens of ways to deal with anxiety, but these are a few that worked for me.  They may or may not work for you, but give them a try and see how it goes.\n\n--Get Support From A Professional--\n\nAfter being in a constant state of panic for months, I decided enough was enough.  I found a mental health organization in my city and asked them if I could come in to talk about what was going on. \n\nI realized that a sick brain probably couldn't fix itself. I needed help from someone who could look at my life from outside of my sickness and see what was going on. \n\nThis is the number one thing I could recommend to someone suffering from anxiety (or may other things). \n\nI still remember the relief, like 100lbs went off my back, when my therapist said: \"You're going to be okay,\" after months of being afraid I was going crazy. \n\nDon't be too proud to ask for help. It's the smart thing to do. And if money is an issue, there are many organizations that provide quality mental health care for people on a low income. That's what I had to do, so I know it's out there.\n\n--Get All The Junk And Bad Habits Out Of Your Life--\n\nI don't care what it is: Excessive driving, smoking, too much caffeine, internet addictions, people that always bring you down. \n\nWhatever it is, do everything you can to get it out of your life. \n\nOur brains our affected by what we put into them and the environments we put ourselves into. There are no exceptions. \n\nYou might not be able to get things perfect, but set yourself up to be a little more healthy every day. Within 3 . . . 6 . . . 12 months, you'll be amazed at how much better you feel.\n\n--You Don't Have To Be Pushed Around By Your Thoughts--\n\nThoughts are just thoughts - not necessarily reality. \n\nOur bodies and minds are fundamentally connected. What we do to our mind affects our body.  What we do to our body affects our mind. \n\nMindfulness meditation, visualization techniques, EDMR (Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing), isochronic beats. All of these techniques help the brain  stabilize itself to a more peaceful state. \n\nI won't get into them here (you'll have to do your own research), but believe me, they help. \n\nNeed an easy way to get started? \n\nBreathe in 4 seconds.\nHold it.\nBreath out 4 seconds.\nRepeat two more times. \n\nFeel better? Do that every time you start to feel anxiety come on. It works. \n\n--Dump The Emotional Garbage--\n\nHolding onto resentment, anger, unforgiveness, bitterness, entitlement, and all those other negative emotions is poison for your brain. \n\nIt doesn't matter whose fault it is -- you have to let that garbage go.  \n\nI've seen people literally go crazy feeling sorry for themselves and being angry at people in their lives who have hurt them. \n\nYeah, it sucks. Especially when it wasn't your fault.  But you have to let it go. \n\nIf you don't know where to start, simply say to yourself: \"I surrender the right to this (anger, resentment, etc.)\" every  time you feel it come on. It might take a couple months to really let it go, but keep practicing this. \n\n--Get Some Sunlight--\n\nThere's something healing about being outside and moving around. Maybe it's because, thousands of years ago, we were basically nomadic and constantly moving around for our survival. \n\nThere's something healthy and healing about the simple act of moving. \n\nYou don't have to go run a marathon or go to the gym four times a week.  Just go outside and walk around the block for twenty minutes.  It'll clear your head and your thoughts. \n\n--Get Your Life Together--\n\nWhen we don't know what we're living for every day and why, it's no wonder we're anxious all the time. \n\nTake a few hours and decide for yourself where you want your life to go, who you want to be, and the people you want to be around. \n\nA couple great places to start:\n\nThe late Scott Dinsmore put together the Live Your Legend website (Google it) to help people get some direction, passion, and purpose in their lives. \n\nRead Man's Search For Meaning by Viktor Frankl (on Amazon). He wrote this book while he was a prisoner at an Auschwitz concentration camp. He was eventually put into leadership at a mental health hospital because so many of their patients were killing themselves. After Frankl came in and used his methodology, not a single person committed suicide under his care.\n\nAnd after you get a rough idea of who you want to be and where you want to go -- start saying \"no\" (say it ALOT) to anything that doesn't get you there.\n\n--Get Out Of Isolation--\n\nIsolation destroys the brain. People are social creatures and without a healthy community of friends and family, we just start getting weird in our thoughts. \n\nAnxiety, paranoia, depression -- these can all come about when we don't spend enough time with others. \n\nIt's hard to have a good community these days. Many experts have called this one of the loneliest generations in American history.\n\nBut you still have to take the initiative and get out there.\n\nCall up old friends (if they're healthy people to be around), go to a cafe, find an interesting group on Meetup.com, go to church.  Do whatever you have to do to get outside and around other people.\n\nThat alone will take 100lbs off your head.\n\n--Be Thankful --\n\nGratitude, even during hard times, will exercise your positivity muscle in your brain. \n\nOnce a day, write down a few things you're thankful for and why. \n\nAfter you've worked through the more obvious things (e.g. family, friends, etc.), try to practice a more difficult form of gratitude: creative gratitude. \n\nWhat is creative gratitude? Being thankful for things that suck.\n\nHere's an example I came up with in my own life recently: \n\nMany things have changed in my life over the last 5-6 years. A lot of things or people that used to give me stability are no longer there or no longer work for me. I was depressed for a long time about it. \n\nEventually I realized that it's healthy for me to change and for life to change. It means I'm alive - because only dead things don't change and grow. \n\nI was eventually able to say to myself: \"Thank you for this opportunity to rewrite my life into anything I want it to be.\"\n\n--Brain-Dump Everything--\n\nStudies have shown that people who write about their negative experiences, even just fifteen minutes a day for five days, have a noticeable increase in their ability to come with hard times.\n\nGo to a Dollar Store and get a cheap notebook. Set a timer for fifteen minutes. Write down everything that comes to mind about your situation. At the end of the week, see how you feel. I bet you'll feel at least a little weight off of your shoulders.\n\n--Four Things You Can Do Every Day To Make Your Life 3,7000% Better Within A Year--\n\nThere are four areas everyone needs to be healthy in to live a good life: physical, mental, emotional, and spiritual. If you improve in those areas just 1% everyday, your life will be 3,700% better within one year.\n\nI did this myself when I was feeling terrible.  Within just two weeks of practicing these ideas daily, I was feeling noticeable better.\n\nI won't write them all out, but Google \"How to be the luckiest guy in the world\" by James Altucher to get the full story (it works). \n\nYou might feel pretty hopeless right now. But if you ask for help, do some research, and take some initiative (ultimately, no one can fix this but you), you can live a much better life in a few short months, and a totally transformed life in a couple short years. \n\nI know this because I've done it for myself.",

Everything in my head seems well thought out, until it comes out of my mouth and it sounds like garage. I don't have knowledge about a lot of things I think I should have knowledge about. I've bullshitted through basically everything my entire life. \n\nSome things I say don't make sense. I forget ALL THE TIME. My friends and family have to repeat certain things to me constantly because i have a hard time remembering a lot of things. Much of anything I'm told goes through one ear and out the other, because there's so much going on inside my head, I can't keep track of what someone is saying to me + what I want to say/respond with. I find myself confused a lot but I play it off like I'm not and just go with most things without really understanding and knowing what I'm going with.

Long story short, I suffer from severe anxiety with panic attacks and depression. \n\nI was at work the other day, not too sure on the details. Had the worst panic attack I've ever had. Lost my memory, peripheral vision. Apparently I ran out of work, somehow ran/walked a mile away, passed out due to hypocapnia from hyperventilating. \n\nThis man helped me. Total stranger. He kept me on the ground, talked to me like I was an actual person, brushed my hair out of my face when I said I was hot, held my hand, talked to my wife on my cell phone which I dropped some yards back. Stayed until emt got there. That will stay with me forever, such true compassion and kindness. My doctors don't even have that capacity. He gave me hope. \n\nThank you, Chad. ",

            "selftext": "After a decade of dealing with crippling anxiety, three years of a panic disorder, and half a year of agoraphobia, I decided to finally start taking the Lexapro prescription my doctor prescribed as backup if other treatments didn't work (tried beta blockers for symptoms and saw a therapist, both helped a bit but not enough). I had been putting off taking it for months but after two awful panic attacks in the span of just a couple days, months of increasing depression, and becoming more and more non-functional, I took half of my dose just now for the first time (my prescription is for 10mg but I'm going to cut them in half for the first week or two).\n\nI get super nervous about medications and I'm terrified that I will have even worse panic attacks, lose my personality or sex drive, become incredibly nauseous/sick, and all other sorts of horrible side effects. I took a xanax with this first dose so that I don't absolutely freak out.\n\nIf anyone has tips or success stories with staring an SSRI, I'd really like to hear them! Please don't respond if you have anything negative to say about them--trust me, I have read all sorts of horror stories but right now am just looking for something positive to keep me from completely panicking.\n\n*UPDATE* Thank you everyone so so much for all the responses! I can no longer keep up with replying but I am still reading all of them. I'm feeling a lot more optimistic of this! As of right now, I'm actually feeling really good for once. Probably the placebo effect from knowing that I'm finally treating this. I'll probably post another update after a couple weeks to let you all know how it turns out.",
