            "selftext": "* Firstly I want to state any advice I might be giving on how I overcame this is not aimed at people who can enjoy a joint or a drink every now and then. I don't mean to sound absolute with some of my statements, it's just in relation to the hole I was in.\n\nI smoked weed for 7 years (started at 16), daily for 6. I slowly started drinking more and more alongside it until it was 4-5 beers and 2 grams of weed daily.\n\nI've had anxiety since about 12. Bad depression, suicidal thinking, isolation gradually got worse from 18. By 22 (last year), life was so shit. It was unbarable. Over the 3 years before I'd had failed relationships, unemployment, family problems, intense isolation (weed and drinks on my own in a little shed watching videos off my phone - 8 hours a day sometimes).\n\nI'm a prime example of using my anxiety as an excuse to abuse substances and avoid social situations and self improvement. I could have convinced you back then that I'm all good, just sorting through things. I have remarkable people skills when I apply them (did sales for 2 years), but I wasn't interested in anything other than getting fucked up and living in a realty where \"this is my life for now . . .\".\n\n\nAlmost decided to live in my car, live with a crack head, travel the country (aka: begin my homeless life, cause I really had no money and if I did it would've gone to beer). I was losing my mind.\n\nAfter being heavily suicidal for a week I decided I can't live like this anymore - but I don't want to die right now.\n\nI planted a thought in my head. 'if you ever want to overcome this, you need to begin to change'. I envisioned the person I wanted to be; even if I wasn't unequipped to be so at the time.\n\n**It took me one year** of very gradual changes to get to where I am now. One week sober. I closed up the shed, changed from bongs to joints and sat outside my house on a chair. The joints got bigger and bigger but a least I was only drinking 2-3 beers a day. \n\nI implemented hobbies back into my life. Didn't spend a lot of time on them, but just 5-10 mins was a start. I joined a gym, some weeks I went once or twice, sometime I didn't go for a month. I reached out to old friends, sometime we didn't catch up until a couple weeks, sometimes we were both busy at different times, but I saw peoples faces and her their voices - after too long of seeing the same-old and only connecting with people through weed or alcohol (or other).\n\nHad to work so hard to **prepare myself** to change my ways. It didn't take weeks or months. It took a whole year - 52 weeks of ups and downs, but a commitment to improving myself. It was difficult. It didn't feel like anything was different mentally until toward the end. I saw psych's, drs, counselors and was so optimistic they would help me change myself until I realized I already knew what to do. I decided I can channel all my anxiety into self improvement.\n\nBought a huge whiteboard, and everyday woke up I had these chores to do. Idea's, reminders, quotes. Things just kept coming to mind. Things to fix/buy/take for a walk/hobbies to look into. I was still a depressed, anxious, alcoholic-stoner - but instead of watching tv, playing games, watching life slip away - I felt like I was on to something.\n\nI never expected the benefits from cutting down and quitting. Every department of my life is better. I had to force change. It took me a year because change made me more anxious.  **I've been sober for a week and the change is awesome!** I laugh, I stay active, I speak clearly, I look people in the eye, I get things done as I want to get them done - immediately. Living a different reality.\n\nIf anyone here is being controlled by these substances I just want to remind you that they are holding you back. These coping mechanisms are making you doubt yourself and not allowing you to progress - not allowing you to know yourself without them.\n \n\nI've heard every excuse in the book against self-improvement. Don't gratify your situation. Don't gratify your anxiety. It's a little runt that wants you to believe you can't change and will never be happy enough anyway. Lower your pride to allow for change. Take control of your life. Learn to love yourself again (you deserve to).   Life will welcome you back with open arms.",

            "selftext": "TL;DR Got over anxiety socially, however recently checking E-mails has made me nervous. This weekend I took off (I'm the CEO trying to be more efficient) &amp; didn't check my E-mail Friday, so I knew I'd be in for a surprise Monday. I have a tendency to get sucked into notifications (even if but a text) and want to know how I can over-come this to not be worried, and more importantly not get sucked into responding to everything. \n\nHey guys, I used to have a tiny bit of shyness &amp; anxiety when I was younger. I'm 19 now, and had forced myself to go out quite a bit (meet women, talk, etc.) and I found that my anxiety all but went away (socially)! \n\nI got an injury though &amp; have been stuck at home for a few months, going out is VERY limited. I kind of let it take me over (I have anxiety around injuries) and hid inside, afraid of getting a set-back (which ironically set me back). Anyways, thought I should share that because it might explain why...:\n\nI went to check my E-mail this morning. I run my own business, and there was just something this morning about checking my E-mail where I was SO SCARED to check it! I had 3 Skype messages, and about 10 E-mails (8 of which were useless). I saw the notifications and had that \"ping\" in my chest like I was gonna die.. \n\nI'm wondering if maybe it's because I haven't been going out. So, in my isolation, the body is naturally becoming anxious again. I might have to force myself to go out even through my physical pain because oh my gosh was checking my E-mail probably the hardest thing today... I can run a multi-national business from home, yet checking what needs to be done today was too scary. I don't understand lol.\n\nSo guys &amp; girls- does checking notifications make you anxious? I find that when I get \"down\" it creates this loop where I'm anxious to check, but I am also addicted to checking (and getting sucked in to whatever it is). It's like I can't leave one notification un-responded. Maybe that's why I was so anxious... this was the first weekend (and Friday) that I didn't check my E-mail AT ALL, so I knew a couple messages would be waiting. ",

I always feel a little bit lighter after I journal.\n\nI've spent the last 2+ years building an online therapy journal called KindMind. I use it pretty-much every day, usually twice a day, so you know it's good\u00ae Thought friends at r/anxiety might find it useful:\n\nhttps://www.kindmind.com\n\nWorks best in Google Chrome. Also, heads up that this isn't a substitute for professional medical care in any way : )\n\nHappy journaling and thanks for reading!",

The thing is, i allways get super anxious when i have to go somewhere, no matter the distance and no matter where i go because of the transportation. I prefer to travel by bus short distances and alone. That way i can get out anytime (i never got out tho i allways ride untill my destination) if i get sick and not bother anyone. Yesterday i had to wait 20 min in a dentist waiting room to get my teeth polished and before we went i was thinking how i would prefer to have my legs broken then go. The point is, i've been to my theraphist 6-7 times allready, she is amazing lady and every time i went everything was superb but i'm tired i have to wrestle my brain every time, every time and about every single possible change and inconvenience  in my life. It's so hard to train that stupid scared brain of mine. So here i sit in my room picking what to wear to my theraphist, i have to leave in an hour and i'm freaking out a bit. Sigh.",

The web design freelancing I did had dried up.\n\nMy days consisted of taking pain killers, watching TV, going to the library with my mother and playing games. I had just moved to a different town and did not have any friends besides people I played basketball with. I obviously couldn't do that anymore so I basically didn't see anyone but my mother and my Aunt that I lived with.\n\nMy addiction the the Vicodin I was taking soon spun out of control. It basically fixed all my problems with pain, depression anxiety, eating, sleeping, you name it. I felt as if it made me a better person. I soon started taking 8-12 a day instead of the 4 or 5 I should have been taking. It was a lot for someone only about 115 lbs.\n\nAs soon as my supply ran out and no longer had refills, my life completely changed. I couldn't sleep, couldn't eat, and was in a lot of pain. It spiraled out of control in the coming days and didn't sleep for 4 straight days. I was overwhelmed with anxiety and vomited for 4 straight days. I went from being a thin 6 feet 135 lbs before breaking my ankle to under 100 pounds after withdrawal.\n\nSuicide was one of the only things I could think about. My panic attacks were so bad I thought I was dying. It wasn't too far fetched considering I had heart surgery a few years before to repair a giant hole in my heart. I thought the chest pains I was having could be from my heart surgery and that I would be dead soon.\n\n**After 4 nights of non stop vomiting, pain, panic attacks, chest pain, suicidal thoughts and no sleep, I wanted nothing else but to die. The only thing that stopped me is that my family would be devastated. There was no way I could do that to them.**\nI decided enough was enough and checked myself into the hospital. They sent me to an inpatient mental hospital after hearing about my suicidal thoughts.\n\nI spoke to a psychiatrist soon after arriving and completely broke down. I had never really talked to anyone and opened up about my depression and anxiety. I poured my heart out and he said I had major depression. He told me how shocked he was I had never told anyone about my years and years of depression and how much of a wreck my life was. He told me I was really strong.\n\nI told him my mother takes Paxil + Abilify and it worked for her. She had been in and out of mental hospitals for the last 5-6 years. He started me on both. I started out very tired from the mix of drugs and slept a lot. I had my 3 meals a day and did all groups.\nI heard so many crazy stories in these groups and it showed me how people were even worse off than I was. Here I was suicidal, depressed, withdrawing from Vicodin, with a broken ankle and people had it worse than me.\n\nMe being me, I got along well with everybody. I had a roommate who said at group that I was the only person he could talk to and get along with. He had anger issues and was very defensive. He tried to kill himself by taking a pot of crack or something like that.\nSome woman told me that the CIA puts chips in our brains so they can watch us from outer space. Some other girl went crazy because the coffee wasn't out early enough. She started pounding on the walls. One of the workers grabbed her hands and another grabbed her feet. She got carried out like that while flopping like a fish. She came back later as a zombie from being drugged up.\nI told one of my roommates I was on Paxil and he said one day I will wake up and it will be like Christmas.\n\nOne night I really wasn't feeling well. I went over to the nurses station and sat down. I told them I felt sick and they told me to wait. I vomited and then went blind. It was the first time I ever lost my vision. I was scared shitless. Some of the fellow patients came over and helped calm me down. I actually prayed with one of them even though I am not very religious. I had nowhere else to turn at that point.\n\nI got taken off of Abilify but stayed on Paxil in the days that followed.\n\nThe day finally my roommate told me about finally came. I woke up feeling happy for the first time in a while a few days later. My Aunt visited me pretty much everyday to bring me clothes, food and see how I was doing. We talked with one of the fellow patients and I actually was laughing and smiling. She said something pretty profound. She said it was the first time she saw me smile in a long time. It reminded me of a dream I had while in the hospital where someone told me to smile more.\nThe psychiatrist told me he thought I was ready to go home. I told him I was still having chest pain, anxiety and my hands were shaking. He told me that was in my head. I thought to myself **\"I'm in a damn mental hospital, of course it's in my head\".** He prescribed me a beta blocker and it helped.\n\nI was finally able to joke around, smile, have energy and feel like I wasn't miserable for once. My family visited one last time and my Uncle was in from Texas. My father was there for the first time. I told them I wanted to go to college. They were happy to see me happy and thinking about the future for the first time in a while. It's funny because one of the patients actually gave me the nickname \"College Boy\" after thinking I was a smart guy and hearing I wanted to go to college.\n\nThe next day we started decorating the ward for the Christmas party we were having in a few days. I pretty much knew I wouldn't be around for it. I was finally ready. I told people at group that night that I was going home. I wished them all well in front of the group.\n\nIt was the turning point of my life. I finally got the help I should have for years earlier. I learned so much about myself in those 12 days. I learned that I can get through anything, I just have to ask for help.",
