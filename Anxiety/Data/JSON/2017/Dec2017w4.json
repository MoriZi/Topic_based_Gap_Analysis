I wasn't too bad before that, I actually had a good job at an estate agents before that. But this year I have suffered a lot.\n\nAnyway I got this interview, and I couldn't sleep the night before, at all. So I spent the entire night watching motivational videos trying to convince myself to give it a shot. The chances of me getting the job were slim, let alone turning up so tired I look stoned and stuttering my speech.\n\nThe whole night and morning I prepared myself, it won't be too long, have a coffee and some caffeine induced paracetamol and it'll blow over, surely I can maintain my composure for half an hour max.\n\nWRONG, 5 hour interview and induction. \n\nSkipping on, I somehow managed to stay composed through my tiredness and anxiety and got the job.\n\nPoint being, don't turn down opportunities, not just with jobs but anything, we worry too much about things going perfect that you probably miss out on perfect moments more trying to avoid the things you fear with anxiety. Don't worry about looking like a dick sometimes or things not going to plan, chances are that things will go to plan, and there's equally as much of an opportunity things go better than as planned. \n\nKeep fighting your anxiety, it'll weaken when you decide to weaken it.",

            "selftext": "I just wanna take a moment and share some good news. I'm a college student home for the holidays, and I began seeking treatment for my anxiety disorder while I was on campus. I didn't tell my parents because they never take any issue I have seriously and continually say I'm being dramatic or how my issue stresses them out and that I should stop. \n   A few days ago, my dad and I got into a huge argument over my hair. The argument ended with me feeling insulted and angry. I stormed off and called my grandmother to vent. As I was talking, I was getting angrier and angrier and it ended up inducing a panic attack. My whole body went numb and I kept telling my grandmother that I couldn't breathe in between gasping for air. When I calmed down, my grandmother said she doesn't like seeing me this upset and that she was worried about my health. After some back and forth about that, I decided to come clean about my disorder and my seeking therapy. I expected her to dismiss me like my parents, but surprisingly, she did the exact opposite. She said I shouldn't feel ashamed about it and that God answered her prayers by giving me the strength and knowledge to recognize the issue and get help for it (I'm not religious but the sentiment was really sweet). I couldn't stop crying out of sheer relief. It felt amazing to just say everything I was feeling without backlash. \n\nTL;DR: Family doesn't know about my anxiety disorder. An argument with my father triggered a panic attack in the middle of a phone conversation with my grandmother. I decided to tell my grandmother about my disorder and she was very accepting and supportive.",

            "selftext": "Couldn't think how to title this. I've got other issues but I'm thinking this one may be tied to my anxiety/panic problems (or maybe it just exacerbates them?)\n\nFor example, I've noticed it most pointedly the past week while my cat's been sick. She's been to the doctor, I'm handling the practical stuff. But emotionally it's roller coaster. She seems to be feeling better (responding to meds and eating) and my mind's saying yeah, she's back. She seems a lil stiff and not eating as much as the previous days and my mind starts planning her funeral. (Rationally I can see she's not acting like a sick cat, you can tell when they're uncomfortable and have given up. Plus the vet hasn't done or said anything that seems like they think she's that sick. It's just my scared little mind that won't shut up and stop crying)\n\nIt's like anything (in general, not just currently with the cat), but any time something isn't perfect, it's the end of the world and I'm positive it'll never get better. So I seem to spend a lot of time worrying about how I'm gonna handle the worst-case scenario which my mind won't stop telling me is definite even though the rational whisper knows I've never yet had to deal with the worst-case scenarios. \n\nI'm just wondering if y'all can relate? is this an anxiety/panic related thing? I've got some other issues (diagnosed bipolar and self-suspected mild asperger's) so I'm trying to define/understand what's going on with this catastrophe thinking because I deal with my issues/symptoms best when I understand better where they stem from.

This happens all the time with friends that I value and want to keep, but I stand in my own way of maintaining these friendships because of social anxiety. I end up losing quality friendships and find myself in less healthy relationships. I need positive people in my life but my social anxiety convinces me that it\u2019s not worth it or that it\u2019ll be awkward and so I self sabotage before I even show up. I feel like a coward and I come off as an apathetic asshole, and apologizing makes things more awkward because ultimately it gets to the point where keeping friendships mean more to me than is socially appropriate. So I brush it off and the invitations stop coming, and I end up lonely because I can\u2019t get out of my own way. I really just want to stop self sabotaging and have the confidence to be social enough to maintain the friendships I value most.",

            "selftext": "Counseling started out about my social anxiety, and led to me realizing my true potential as well as other problems in my life I was completely unaware of, such as the distance between me and my father. It also ultimately made me realize I don\u2019t give myself enough credit for the things I\u2019ve done; like paying for college, paying rent/utilities, managing money, cooking, cleaning, car maintenance, etc. What makes me most proud of myself is making this decision early on in my life. I\u2019m currently 21y/o, and I\u2019ll finish college with 2 degrees in a few years. I haven\u2019t made any friends or acquaintances in 3 1/2 years of college, until recently after I received counseling for 10 months, and taking an anti-depressant (Zoloft). \n\nI have been out of a relationship (lasted for 1 year 7 months) for 4 years where I was mentally, emotionally, and psychologically abused and manipulated, lied to, cheated on. The relationship sucked my will power away, and completely got rid of all my social abilities; I had no idea how to talk to people I didn\u2019t already know, and I sometimes didn\u2019t know how to talk to people I did know, like my dad for instance. It also took away my ability to feel emotion. Six months ago, my grandmother was being rushed to the hospital for reasons I didn\u2019t know of. I got a call from my sister crying her eyes out telling me about it, and hoping that grandma would be okay. After the call ended, I began crying not because of the situation my grandma was in, but because I didn\u2019t feel worried, concerned, scared, sad, or feel anything for her; I cried because I felt no type of emotion about the fact that my grandma could die... She never wronged me, I was always happy whenever I saw her, and when I heard she\u2019s being rushed to the hospital, I felt nothing... That depressed the he\u2019ll out of me. (Thankfully, she didn\u2019t die, and is still very much alive!) The emotional numbness I developed in that relationship years ago was still hanging around, and I had no idea how to get rid of it. \n\nI had an addiction. Not to drugs or alcohol, but an addiction to thoughts. I was constantly rummaging in my head, thinking about how to be social: \n- I should say **\u201dthis\u201d**, but what if they say **\u201dthat\u201d** in response to **\u201dthis\u201d**? \n- What exact words should I say? \n- What phrases should I say? \n- What order should I speak them in? \n- Which way should I word the phrase?\n- How do I approach them?\n- How much eye contact should I make?\n- What if what they start talking about goes against this long, thought out conversation I\u2019ve created in my head? \n\nThis overthinking and compulsive thinking led to me altering my recollection of the past. I would talk to someone in my head about an event that may have happened between the two of us, and over time I would slowly alter the facts in my head so much that the truth about what happened was altered/falsified in my memory. While I was in my head so much, I changed the things in the past that I didn\u2019t like.\n\nI changed jobs every so often because working was a distraction from myself; it was a way for me to get outside of my head for a while. And when one job got so boring that I was in my head on the job, I went and found another job.\n\nRather than talking to people in the real world, I talked to them in my head. It occurred so much that, for example, studying a 3-page study guide took 8 hours because I would be reading aloud the study material, then start talking to someone in my head for an hour or so. And when taking the test or just doing anything else, I *sometimes* wasn\u2019t able to remember specific information until I was talking to the specific person I was talking to when my brain I took in this information. **The most important thing I learned from this** is that out of all the people I talked to in my head, *I never talked to myself.* I told myself that I was talking to myself in my head, and that\u2019s what I told other people, like my counselor. But I never actually did talk to me... I lived life after the relationship broken, and in despair because talking to people in my head was a way to numb the pain I felt; I never began the healing process until after a few months into counseling, 3 1/2 years after the relationship ended. Better late than never!\n\nFrom my experience, I think the biggest thing to take away is that you need to find your voice. Find how you express yourself; find yourself. Express yourself TO yourself; voice yourself to yourself. Literally talk to yourself, your person. Talking to yourself will give you insight you had no idea existed:\n- Alright *insert your name,* what\u2019s going on with **blank?**\n- How do feel about **blank**, *insert your name?*\n- What\u2019s holding you back?\n- Are you doing anything to yourself that is holding yourself back from your full potential?\n- How are you holding yourself back?\n- What would make you stop holding yourself back?\n- What are you scared of?\n- What makes you sad?\n- What makes you happy? Or...\n- What *would* make you happy?\n\n",
