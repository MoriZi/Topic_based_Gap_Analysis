I can actually start saving money and hopefully move forward with my life once I have some savings. I work again today but only for 4 1/2 hours. I mostly watch and clean up after a couple dozen puppies, and even through all the poop and smells I really love interacting with them all.

I had to ask her to repeat her question because I was panicking and my eyes started to well up. She was very patient and understanding and ultimately penciled me in for about a week and a half from now. \n\nI've dreaded going to therapy my entire life and actively argue, fight, and cry against it like a child (I'm 22)...all because of the crippling anxiety I know I need it for. It's always killed me that the thing I need therapy most for is the thing holding me back from it. After I hung up I immediately broke down crying in the corner of my bed and my boyfriend told me how proud of me he was and that he'd be happy to go with me to my first appointment and wait for me. \n\nHopefully this can be some inspiration to anyone else with a similar issue.

I used to get reprimanded for it when I was in a police explorers group; the detective who led it yelled at me for saying it so often. Of course, I ended up holding my tongue and just shied away from the rest of the group. When I started working my first part-time job, everyone made sure to note when I apologized profusely because I felt like I messed up. At school: the same. But only my favorite teacher never made fun of me, she just reassured me that there was no reason to apologize.\n\nI'm in college now, studying to be a Spanish teacher. I want to break this habit, but it has progressed so much. When I say sorry, I really do mean it because I feel as though I've screwed up somehow, but I understand it can sound repetitive and insincere to others. I don't want to be annoying, but I honestly can't help it. I apologize for, what others say, the stupidest and smallest of things. If I don't know how to do something I'll apologize for not having the knowledge in whatever it was. On days where I feel really bad and more aware of myself, I just don't speak.\n\nI want to work towards being more professional and not so anxious all the time. The medication I've taken for the past 2 1/2 years has helped tremendously with my anxiety, but now that I've gotten this far, I want to break old habits. What can I do?",

            "selftext": "Background: I am a 20 year old female. I fucked up my high school years because of agoraphobia and anxiety. Classes were a nightmare to me, but I managed to graduate in 2014 regardless (with a very low attendance level). I spent the following years struggling to improve my education and getting a treatment that helped me a lot. In fact, this year I was just admitted to an excellent university, my dream program.\n\nNow that my first semester at uni started, I am scared shitless. I have been skipping some classes (not as much as I was in school, but still) simply because sometimes I feel SO FUCKING ANXIOUS during classes. My mind thinks about so many things at once. \"What if I leave class, everybody will notice\", \"what if I have a panic attack here\", \"what if I faint\", and so on. And the fact that I know I have to stay there fucks up my anxiety even more. I just wish I had a trick or two to control those intrusive/negative thoughts, that are product of a mixture of agoraphobia, fear of bodily sensations and maybe social phobia. \n\nI don't plan on skipping classes anymore, I am planning on going tomorrow, warrior mode, and planning to face everything, no matter how hard it will be. I can still save my semester. I just wish things weren't so hard. \n\nSide note: I'm already on CBT and psychiatric treatment, which to be fair, helped me a lot. My therapist says my classroom anxiety will drop the more I expose myself (and she said this wouldn't happen overnight), but damn. Sometimes it is just so difficult.",

            "selftext": "I got home from my therapist last night and wife told me she had taken 24- 200mg seroquels. I called the squad and she was taken to a local ER where they intubated her and got her stable. She is now awaiting transport to a psych unit.\nI understand this is needed and also that while she is in their care she is being well taken care of. However as my therapist has told me she is my drug and I feel so alone and lost without her. I am trying hard to keep it together for my kids and I am aware of some coping mechanisms that I learned about earlier this year when her and I were both hospitalized.\nI'm not sure how I feel at the moment, I feel a little numb to be honest but also so conflicted in my emotions. I've worked out and my frustration helped me set a new personal best on the dead lift, but nothing is bringing me joy.\nI don't feel as if I will do anything silly but I am glad that we have no firearms in the house. \n\nedit: Update: She is still awaiting transport at this time last I heard. Thanks all for the support and the great ideas on how to help my wife, myself and my family during this time. u/kev753 I like the idea of a letter, I will definitely do that. It helped when her and I exchanged letters when we both in the hospital last time. Different units obviously but the nurses and pca's were very cool and allowed us to pass notes. Also her parents are not helpful at all during these times. They feel as if they have done their time trying to understand her illness (bipolar1.) So there is no longer a need for them to be bothered when she is in the hospital for a mental problem; because according to her mother it is all just in her head.\nu/snugglyaggron I will gladly take valuable insight wherever I get it; even if it's from random strangers on the internet.\nOne other note for now; while I have had my moments this evening with crying and all that that jazz, I have also been trying to \"detach.\" THe book \"co-dependent no more,\" by Melody Beattie has been really helpful and insightful in that regards. I will update as I hear more. Thanks again all it does mean a lot to me.\n\nedit: update II; I jut got back from seeing her at the psych unit. It brought back a lot of memories; because I was there myself in January. She was really wanting to get a shower and get cleaned up; which I take as a good sign. She signed some paperwork that stated she agreed to stay 7-10 days. I am not sure how concrete those days are; especially since she is really wanting to do a group therapy step down program. Her parents are being asshats about the matter still, and she was upset that they were acting that way, and I get that it's tough when you do have the support of those who seem closest to you. u/iliketosmellmypoop you are 100% correct that there is almost no talk about mental illness, and it is really pissing me off too. I am now at the point where if someone asks how thing sare going I am going to be up front and tell them how my wife is doing, and what is going on; because FUCK THE STIGMA!\nThanks all for the love and support; I will continue to update as I can.\n\nedit: update III for those still following. She was in better spirits when I left her this evening. She feels as if this was a call for help and that she is glad she got a \"reboot;\" now she wants to focus on not only getting herself better but also the things our family needs to do move on. Again I thank you all for the outpouring of love and support. We're not out of the woods yet, but I think we can see a break through the trees.\n\nedit: update IV She is still in the hospital and when she asked about being released all she was told was this week. I have had multiple breakdowns over this whole situation over the weekend, but I haven't checked out yet. I know that will only solve the problem for me. She has had a couple of her meds changed and she was finally started on an anti depressant today. I know I am blessed that she didn't succeed in her attempt; however my heart aches for my wife. \n\nEdit V: if anyone is still interested in this thread or not. I'm editing because I'm happy. Both of us spent the past few days guarded 'ly' optimistic. However she is coming home tomorrow morning. Just have to wait until I get a call to go pick her up. I am aware we both have a lot of work to do on ourselves and also in our marriage.  Thanks everyone for the love and support during this time. ",

            "selftext": "Emergency Room Physician (M.D.) here, wanted to tell my story. Just to let you all you guys know, this shit can affect anyone, and you can still be successful in life.\n\nStarted in high school, I would say this was an existential crisis that started my anxiety. Did not know what it was(anxiety that is), initially saw a social worker, she referred me to a PhD psychologist who diagnosed me with OCD, I saw a psychiatrist in the same office who gave me clonazepam as needed (which worked). I had tried Lexapro. 1 dose, increased my anxiety 100x, decided to not go ahead with it. I essentially thought I had OCD, my psychologist taught me CBT ways where increasing my exposure to things that bothered me and made me anxious would in the long run make me not anxious.  This existential crisis/anxiety/OCD spilled over into freshman year of college and then I became focused on 1 goal - getting into medical school. Anxiety kinda disappeared (I mean, I am sure I still had it being a neurotic type A personality, but it wasn't an every day all day for no reason type of anxiety like I had had).\n\nWell the day came, I got into medical school. Starting medical school that anxiety came back, for a few weeks. New city, new people, new environment, new work load, more stress.  This also eventually tapered off on its own.\n\nThen residency hit, anxiety came back in full force. In residency training I was working 60-80 hours a week. Constantly switching from days to nights. Getting yelled at and called \"dumb\" by senior attending faculty physicians for not working up a patient right, this or that. The intensity and stress (over 300K of med school debt) caused one of my worst periods of anxiety to date. I seeked help, finally getting a psychiatrist (hadn't seen one in years) and after only a session or maybe 2 diagnosed me with GAD.  I had no idea.  We also did some CBT although it was different than the CBT/exposure/response therapy I had done for OCD.  In the end, it was too much and I ended up on Zoloft.  Like my prior episode with lexapro, I took a dose and the medication shot my anxiety to the roof. I ended up on a slow taper up eventually getting to 100 mg and for the remainder of residency my anxiety was on the backburner/gone.\n\nWe decided that maybe I could try getting off the med, and I tapered over a few months with no side effects. Sure enough though, the anxiety came back (essentially night shifts and switching back to days doesn't help anxiety).  I now am working my way back up.\n\nSo anyway, thats my story. I made it through all that training with GAD, at times terrible, crippling anxiety.  I say this for those of you struggling in classes or with careers, if I somehow did it, you can too.\n\nIf any of you guys have any questions for me (like how do I treat anxious people that I see in the ER?) or other questions feel free to ask!\n",

Daily full blown panic attacks. I still have lots of anxiety issues, but the big ones are gone. I can go to the store now.

            "selftext": "My anxiety is under control for the most part. I was on medication years ago but not any more. I have some mild generalized anxiety but it only really flares when I'm dealing with stressful situations like a lot of deadlines.\n\nOver the last few years I've started having bad anxiety-related bathroom issues when I'm in social situations. I *like* going out but I hate when it does to my body. I never had this when I was younger. \n\nAt first I only sometimes got the poops/constant need to pee when I went to clubs and shows, I just thought it was from alcohol - but then I realized it happens when i don't drink too. It's got much worse since, now it's to the point that I have to pee every 15-20 minutes when I go out, even when I'm sober. I usually get mild diarrhea too, but sometimes it's REALLY bad. There have been nights when I'm literally in the bathroom (and actually going every time) every 10 minutes. I'll get a solid 5 minutes of relief before my insides are spasming again. At parties I can barely stand because I constantly feel like I have to pee. When I'm stressed out at work, this leaks over to my home life and I sometimes have to get up 2-3 times at night to use the bathroom, and sex is difficult because I constantly feel like I need to pee.\n\nI became very aware of it last week when I was trying to buy tickets to a show I knew was going to sell out right away, I was really stressed/nervous about getting them and - I had to run to the bathroom to poop THREE times in the HOUR before they went on sale. \n\n**Here's the thing though**, pepto and imodium seem to do nothing. If I go out for a night with friends, there have been times I've eaten 6-8 pepto tablets and still have to use the bathroom constantly. One night not long ago I had 3-4 imodium pills and I was still in the bathroom actually pooping every 10 minutes for the first 2 hours, we went out the next night too and I had another 2-3 pills and it was better but I still used the bathroom probably 6 times in 4 hours.\n\nIt seems unhealthy to be downing like 6 Imodiums before I go out for a night (once every ~2 months) but I don't know what else to do. \n\nHelp!
