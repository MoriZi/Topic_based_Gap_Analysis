So they were possibly crushed?She let out a screech but she seemed fine afterwards :(\n\n\nThis morning I woke up to her sprinting around the house on one paw. It\u2019s swollen, guys. Really badly. She\u2019s freaking out and I\u2019m just freaking the fuck out. My SO has an important meeting today which means he is unable to take her / accompany me to the vet.\n\nSo I\u2019m having some anxiety right now because:\n\n\n1. Driving anxiety \n\n\n2. Social anxiety\n\n\n3. My cat is in pain and it\u2019s fucking freaking me the fuck out.\n\n\nMy SO said I could wait until tomorrow morning and we could take her together, but I can\u2019t even look at her paw without bursting into tears. So I\u2019m doing it. I\u2019m bringing her there all by myself. I\u2019m freaked out because I want her to be okay and I\u2019m freaking out because of the steps I have to take to do this. I\u2019m not going to let my anxiety take a toll on my pets. \n\n\nEdit: I\u2019m at the Vet with her still. She doesn\u2019t have any broken bones, but they have me some stuff to give her to (hopefully) bring down the swelling over the weekend. \n\n\nEdit 2: I inserted some pictures of her at the end of our visit. She\u2019s going to be okay. :) Thank you /r/anxiety for your endless support. ",

            "selftext": "And it feels great! I realised over the past few months that it gives me anxiety, and it's just an awful place for me to be on. There's so much drama, and gossip that stems from FB and I'm so over it. I was hardly posting anyway, I had it more for keeping up with my interest and local community pages, but Reddit is a great place for that. I still kept my Instagram just because I like posting my pics there, but Facebook is no use to me anymore. I feel so liberated! \n\nEdit: Wow, I'm so positively overwhelmed with all the responses, this subreddit community is so awesome. I'm so glad to see I'm not the only one that feels this way about social media. To me it was a mixture of several things that made me do this. \n\nI've been off work with anxiety for some time (only just gone back), and found out that people have been talking behind my back about what I'd been liking and posting on Facebook in that time (I barely posted anything), and how that must mean I'm fine and I was just looking to have a long period of time off to have fun, apparently. Also lots of indirect comments on Facebook regarding myself from my great work colleagues, who I thought were my 'friends' before I had been signed off work, and seeing people portray themselves to be completely different on social media, as opposed to what they're like in real life. Before I went off sick, some of my colleagues openly spoke about posting statuses, liking something or checking in somewhere, for the sole purpose or winding other colleagues up, and I don't need that in my life. They would also always talk about what people posted and bitch about it, and I figured they must be doing the same to me, if they did it to others, especially since I came back to work they have been acting weird and really offish with me. \n\nAnother factor was the whole 'comparing yourself to others' thing, that made me feel inadequate a lot of the time, but then I quickly remember that a lot of these people live a fake lifestyle for social media. \n\nHonestly, I've felt for some time that Facebook is just a massive waste of time, but there was always that FOMO factor that stopped me deactivating it. I'm glad I finally decided to take that step. Here's to feeling better and not giving a shit about some meaningless social media bullshit! \n",

            "selftext": "Hey friends, I just wanted to pop in and share some success.\n\nThis morning, for the first time in two weeks, I woke up calm and not full of panic. This is a big deal for me because I\u2019ve been having an intense period of anxiety lately and the mornings have been the hardest on me. Lately I\u2019ve had to jolt out of bed to pace my apartment until I felt like I wasn\u2019t going to die. Followed by crying in the shower and hiding in bed until I could feel in control of myself.\n\nI just wanted to let everyone know that while we can\u2019t \u201ccure\u201d anxiety from never coming back, we all can and eventually will have better times. Two weeks ago I felt like I was going to die. I couldn\u2019t eat, sleep or honestly communicate my feelings to my friends or family. I felt so alone and weak I didn\u2019t know what to do. But slowly by slowly I started to find the courage to do things that might help. A little exercise here, a little deep breathing there. I\u2019ve realized that a bunch of small steps towards feeling better does add up over time. And that\u2019s coming from one of the most cynical and negative people.\n\nI believe in each and every one of you. Whether you believe it or not, better times will come again. If you asked me a few weeks ago I would have told you I felt like not living. But now I woke up and felt like a normal person for once. I know it won\u2019t last forever and the anxiety will eventually be back. But I keep telling myself that if I\u2019ve progressed once, that I can do it as many times as I need.\n\nHold on, take care of yourselves and fight. We are all so much stronger than we know. I bet most of you have had to endure so much more struggle than me over the years and you\u2019re still standing today. We can do this. It might not always be pretty and we might not always find success but we are capable.\n\nEdit: a extra word",

So like if I ordered some food at McDonalds and the cashier was cute, and I said something that made her laugh, I'd play back the conversation and repeat out loud, maybe more than once, the thing that made her laugh.  It has a soothing effect but I don't do it on purpose.\n\nAs for future conversations, usually this involves imagining an interaction with someone I know who I dislike or who stresses me out, and I'm arguing with them in my head, and during the argument I imagine what they'd say and I respond to it out loud.  Usually it's something I wouldn't have the courage to say to their face.\n\nDoes anyone relate to these experiences?  Both of these only happen when I'm alone.  Personally I consider them a couple steps shy of full blown talking out loud to people who don't even exist, and it scares me.",

Since getting caught he has continued to work with her despite my feelings while simultaneously continually lying to me about the nature of their relationship. I can't eat, sleep, work, or think straight knowing that he still talks with her and spends most of his day with her. I've tried to leave him multiple times but each time results in a huge panic attack, but staying with him while he works with her causes daily anxiety attacks. I am now outside his work, watching them interact through glass doors like a psycho. I need medical help but can't bring myself to admit myself. I am so frozen with anxiety that I'm stuck in this parking lot unable to drive myself home. \n\nSomeone smack me. ",

I came off as mean when I was just actually nervous. I couldn't think clearly and answer/ask questions the way I needed. I was very vague and was not open enough with the interviewers. Based on their facial expressions, they thought I was weird, and I'm 99% sure I did not get the job.\n\nI have been working a $9/hour for the past 4 years, only now I'm using it solely to eat and pay my debt. No way I can afford my own place. This interview that my friend helped set up was my biggest hope to get out of the rut that I am in and I fucked it up.
