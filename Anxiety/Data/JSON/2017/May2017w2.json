The Day before I start getting this terrible grumpy attitude and mood, I start feeling depressed, my day is ruined because of this thing the next day.\n\nI start losing sleep, I toss and turn at Night before this scheduled thing thinking and thinking about the worst thing ever happening tomorrow to me, when in actuality it never turns out to be that bad.\n\nThen the Day of this thing rolls around, I wake up in an absolute foul mood, I set off 3 hours earlier than I probably should have just because I can't bear the thought of sitting in the house when I have this thing coming up (I psychically cannot relax, my body won't allow me). I've tried staying at home knowing I have some appointment later in the day, and I honestly feel like I'm trapped in a jail cell.\n\nBut then, after all of that, a huge sigh of relief just blows over me. This thing I've been worrying about wasn't even that bad, but the build-up is the real killer, the real anxiety builder and sometimes I honestly feel like I'm losing my sanity. I go from this grumpy, depressed guy to someone absolutely happy beyond belief at least for those few hours after getting something done.",

Last summer (between Junior and Senior year of high school) I planned to commit suicide to escape my anxiety. I couldn't turn off my brain and I couldn't handle it anymore. I had a therapist and saw a psycologist but they only made it worse, the therapist honestly shouldn't be allowed to practice.\n\nI held two bottles of anxiety pills in my hands considering taking them. They would have killed me. But instead I walked to my parents and handed over all my medicine and told them I needed more help or I would die, I was finally honest about how bad it was. I spent most of my summer in and out of the ER and in an adolecent psych ward where I got help.\n\nI am off of suicide watch now. I don't self harm anymore. I have control over my anxiety. Of course I still struggle with panic attacks and some situations but I found healthy ways to cope. I haven't cut since August. \n\nI'm just posting not only because I am proud of how far I've come, and I have just finished my stressful IB diploma exams. But I also want to give hope to people. I did it. I got help. I'm alive and I honestly thought I wouldn't make it here. Anxiety is part of my life, but it doesn't control me. I am alive. ",

The race was one of the two options my professor offered for extra credit on the math final (or we could build a robotic project). I chose the latter because there was no way I felt that I could do the run alone. Besides, none of my friends could do it because of their jobs and busy schedules. But this morning I woke up feeling depressed/angsty. I sat there thinking for a while but a few minutes later I randomly chose to go at the very last minute. \n\nWhen I pulled into the parking lot I had a huge wave of anxiety hit me when I saw hundreds of people. I wanted to run away and go home but I chose to stay instead. It was difficult to just walk amongst the large crowds and being alone kind of exacerbated my anxiety. I registered and waited until the race started. Those 25 minutes of waiting felt like hell. \n\nThen the race started. I did struggle a bit in the beginning (not very athletic) but by the end of the race, I was really happy. I also met some amazing people on the way and we all encouraged each other to keep going, even if we were complete strangers. I would've never imagined doing something like this out of the blue, especially alone, but I did it! I do not regret this decision at all. This is a start! \n\nEdit: Thank you for all the kind support, you're all great people!",

            "selftext": "My doctor and counselor have me listed as Extreme Anxiety and Depression, Early childhood PTSD, Bi polar, borderline personality disorder. It's a relief to have an answer to what my problems are. This has been an on going problem my whole adult life. My first job, I had reasons for being depressed. I dropped out of school, parents were divorcing and I didn't have a stable housing situation, I was falling behind and depressed, full of anger and anxiety. I didn't want to call myself weak though and admit I had a problem, so I attempted to self medicate by escaping reality. \n\nI skateboarded, played video games, drank, smoked weed, partied, did everything I could to feel numb. 5 years later, because I didn't seek help or medication early on, I was put on suicide watch due to my new medications not working properly. I have had a girlfriend for 4 years now, I just play games now and skate, no negative influences in my life.\n\nNone the less, last month I lost my job, where both my girlfriend and i worked together, and commuted together for 2 hours everyday. We both made pretty decent incomes, My girlfriend is my back bone and structure to things getting better in my life. I can't thank her enough despite me losing my job and making the workplace awkward for her. \n\nShe helped me apply for disability. She helped me stay in contact with my Advocate for whatever questions needed to be answered. We filled out the questionnaire's together and made the best of a shitty situation, we have savings to go off of, luckily we live with her father in a nice location in California Rent free, we cover utilities and our phone bill/internet and that's it. Well, has and groceries as well, we just do our best on her one income until my SDI gets submitted and approved. I'm currently seeking my residency and gathering needed paperwork for the drivers written test, then I can finish my SDI application.\n\n\nMy point to all this is I would be homeless and probably dead without her. She has saved my ass countless times over the years,having a mental illness makes holding a job so fucking difficult, I've lost at least 6 jobs since being with her.  I have nothing but respect and love for her to be putting up with all this, while we are both still fairly young (I'm 24, she's 21 later this year) I wish her parents understood mental illness, but it's kind of a Taboo in her family so we keep things as vague as possible. \n\n\n\nI just hope that I get through to disability services and can make an income that way, to relieve some stress from her life. She put off school for me from the very beginning, the least I can do is help her get through school. \n\nSorry about the rant. I hope everyone has a great day. \n\n\n",

We have a rule that we go together but work out separately. Today I was running on the treadmill and started have a severe panic attack about work responsibilities (I am a young associate in a big law firm and I'm near my breaking point between the hours/stress). I walked into one of the yoga rooms that wasn't being used, and started having short breaths and chest pains. I was struggling to control it or myself. Tears welling. Fuck I was lost.  A minute later the door opens and my husband walks in. He wraps me in a hug and says \"sssh come here\". I just started bawling. He held me and said had me do my deep breathing with him. Then when I finally calmed down I apologized to him for ruining his workout (his sweat and dried and he was cooled down). He said \"babe lets work out together. You'll feel better.\"  we did some great circuit training and then came home, opened wine and ordered sushi. \n\nGrateful for a man who understands me, and my anxiety.",

Every time he looked at me, itd make me feel belittled and raped. My housemate has the same insecure belittling qualities my father has. I was also beaten and emotionally manipulated by an abusive mother who beat me with a stick, only yelled and never spoke, used me to polish her ego, used me to shame my father, shamed me, embarrassed and belittled me by objectifying me and herself, and buried verbal poison into wounds she'd keep open with her constant psychological insanity. My roommate who sleeps next to me has the same judgmental and psychopathic qualities as she has. I'm trying to ease the trauma i've felt ever since I was first beaten by them at too young of an age to remember by loving myself and hugging pillows while I feel vulnerable, but it's hard. It's really really hard. None of them know who I am. Not even the brother I though would be my companion but ended up severely abusing me through-out my entire life. Physically, emotionally, verbally, mentally, and sexually abusing me. He'd \"sock me in the face\" every chance he could, pushed me around, step on me, make me suck his dick, make me eat my own shit, call me fat and autistic, and just release his anger any chance he could in any way he could find using me. I need to get away from all this abuse. I want to love myself for who I am and comfort myself and be there for myself and love being me. I want my life back from all the abuse. I want to absolutely own my life. Right now I need comfort and love and compassion and empathy for the little boy who was first beaten by his parents and left alone feeling abused and abandoned too young to do anything about it.

I've been playing guitar for 6 years now but still know virtually nothing about scales, chords, hell I don't even know most brands of guitars or amps or pedals or any of that stuff at all. So it makes me feel like everything I do with guitar isn't genuine.\n\nIt's hard to explain but I hope I made a little bit of sense. Can anyone else relate to this?",

I've only recently come to acknowledge my anxiety issues, so I thought maybe you folks could help out.\n\n\nIt doesn't matter what side you are on politically, or if you are - like I am - more in the moderate/independent sphere. It's hard not to look at Washington DC right now and not feel like the whole damn country is about to collapse. The president and his people are involved with Russia, maybe? They are changing health insurance, or they aren't, or they are, or they aren't etc....the country feels like it's totally unstable and chaotic right now. I'm definitely angry at Republicans right now because they look like such villains, but the democrats aren't exactly charging in to save the day, so I am not super happy with them either. \n\n\nI feel oppressed, and in truth my life hasn't really changed much at all since Trump (but then he hasn't really DONE very much successfully yet). I think it might be more in my head than anything. But I can't turn it off. I can't stop being afraid of what's going on here. My anxiety often causes sleep problems, stomach issues, etc...but it's getting so much worse lately.\n\n\nI have thought about trying to avoid any and all news sources, but I don't even know how other than sticking my head in the sand. Is it a good idea to quit social media for a while, and try to avoid checking media websites? Is there a better way to shed this anxiety? I feel like this is the extra bit of anxiety that's going to rip my psyche apart but I'm not really sure how to fix it, short of...I don't know, moving to Canada. I wish I just didn't care, but my country is such a big part of what I grew up being taught to believe in, and I feel like its downfall has begun. I guess when I have a problem in my own life, even when it feels big I know somewhere in my mind that it's small. But this one...outside my quivering stomach, this still feels like a really big deal.\n\n\nTL;DR: The American political climate is bringing me to new heights of anxiety and I don't know how to overcome it.",

While taking it, I forgot so many minor details because of the stress. Thankfully, I passed. But now, I'm anxious about it? I can't explain it, it feels like I'm having flashbacks to the test and all the places I made a mistake or could have made a mistake.\n\nI've been noticing this a lot lately, especially after exams even after passing and getting good grades, I get anxious about all the things I could have gotten wrong or actually got wrong. It's like I'm creating stress and anxiety in the hole that once held stress and anxiety.\n\nI'm wondering if this is part of the human experience, a part of anxiety, or if I'm just more messed up than I ever thought. I'm talking with my therapist soon so I'll ask then, but I guess I'm looking for a broader community of fellow anxiety-sufferers.",
