It is acquired by shunning politics and obnoxious people, by paying no attention to the gods or an afterlife, and by devoting oneself to trustworthy friends and a simple life. Ataraxia was important to the Stoic philosophers, also, but for them the final goal was apatheia, which means not \u201capathy\u201d in the modern sense but \u201ccalmness,\u201d imperturbability gained from the pursuit of virtue. Ataraxia (spelled atarxie) entered English in the early 17th century.",

I realized it was time for me to cut a lot of social media out of my life because it's seriously giving me horrible panic. I just impulsively deleted my Instagram and a few other apps.

            "selftext": "My therapist argues that, in the short term, alcohol decreases anxiety but increases anxiety in the long term, because alcohol puts the break on nerve firing and the brain responds by putting on the accelerator. How is this any different to the benzos we get prescribed? They work on the same GABA receptor and can also increase anxiety in the long term, even causing new anxiety conditions in people who took them for non-related conditions such as epilepsy. As far as I'm aware the only real difference between cooling the nerves with a couple of pints and taking a xanax is that alcohol can be smelled on the breath and hence is not practical. Not to mention somebody taking a regular prescribed dose of xanax may get similar withdrawals to a person who drank 1L of vodka every day for ten years.\n\nNOTE: I do not dispute the fact that benzos are more effective as anxiolytics because they are indeed \"cleaner\" drugs. However, my therapist's logic that taking the GABA agonist known as alcohol can worsen anxiety in the long term clearly applies to benzos too, especially if it's a short half life one that can cause \"inter-dose withdrawal\".

I posted it knowing I would get downvoted to oblivion and I still wanted to offer an alternate perspective. But now every time I think about checking to see if anyone has commented on any other posts I refuse to look because I might see the shit storm in my inbox that I'm not even sure happened.

            "selftext": "Short backstory: my entire life I've had crippling social anxiety. There were no causes or events that happened to me as a child to make me this way. I've just always been like this. My earliest memory of being afraid of people is in preschool when I hid behind a stack of books because some kids from the class room across from mine came over and they scared me. It's been an issue literally since day one. \n\nI've been trying to put myself out in the world more. As I stated, I've had this chronic issue for me entire life without any cause. For the first 19 years of my life, I was in denial of it. I told myself I just didn't like people. I told myself I thought they were annoying. I told myself I have better things to do than to interact with people. Despite all this, I would still notice myself craving social interaction but would then catch myself and tell myself \"No, you hate people. You don't want to talk to them\"...but that was always a lie. I knew it was a lie but I pretended it wasn't. Now, at the age of 19 years and 11 months (so we'll just say 20), I'm finally realizing its an issue that has to be fixed. I've just been so socially starved my entire life that I have no experience on how to properly communicate with people. My sister and my closest friend say that I have an extremely sociable personality when I'm around people I know. They say I'm smart and funny and really approachable but when I'm around people I don't know, my brain switches into awkward mode. Because of this, I give off really bad first impressions and can't be myself. Myself is who I am around my sister and my close friends. My not-self is who I am around everyone else. The problem is to be myself, I need to be extremely (and I mean EXTREMELY) familiar and comfortable with someone before I can actually let my personality out into the open. I don't do it intentionally though. Whenever I'm in a situation with someone I don't know that well, I literally forget how to be myself. When I'm with my sister and friends, I don't stop talking. I always know what to say and can keep a conversation going for hours. When I'm around an unfamiliar face, I'm lucky to get enough words out to last 5 minutes. It makes me think that my anxiety is just part of who I am and not a fixable issue. I've been having small conversations with various classmates to try and get better at this but I don't feel like it works. Some have even asked me to hang out after class so that means however I act and talk appeals to people, but it's still incredibly painful for me. I typically reject these invites because it makes me too nervous. I'm a naturally introverted person like my dad, so that just makes it harder to get along comfortably with people. I've fucked up a lot potential friendships and a lot of potential relationships because even though people want to hang out with me, I don't want to hang out with them. Not because I'm not interested in getting to know them or be friends with them, but because I get too scared to be around them outside of school. With school, I can just use the excuse of \"oh, I have to go to class\" if I'm feeling too anxious. I don't have that option outside of campus. It's even more frustrating because I'm consciously aware of the fact that I can't be myself around people I don't know. I'll get stuck in an awkward silence and I know that typically, I can break silence around my friends and feel totally fine but when around someone I don't know, I just freeze up and can't think or break the silence like I usually do. I fucking hate it and honestly don't know if I'll ever be able to fix this. I'm 50 steps behind everyone else when it comes to social skills and I feel like I'm trying way too late in life to fix this. My greatest fear is being alone. And if I can't overcome this, that fear might become a reality some day. I want to get better but honestly, I'm afraid this is just who I am as a person; and you can't exactly change who you are.",
