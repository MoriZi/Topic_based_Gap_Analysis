Things that are store policy. I couldn't call a manager because if I tried to speak I'd become completely inaudible from sudden sobbing. I had to stand there and take it all as if I was okay with it.\n\nSo many stores require you to tell them if you have severe depression. They consider it a disability. They should be asking about PTSD and anxiety. I was alone outside. And if it wasn't for one saint of a customer who came up to the man and screamed at him for being such an asshole, I don't know what wouldve happened.\n\nIt is nearly 5 hours later. I'm home. And I still can't stop my heart rate from beating so fast and panicking.\n\nI couldn't show anyone at work how broken and scared I was. I had to keep playing it off as allergies. I had to run to the bathroom saying it's my period suddenly showing up.\nI had to chug water to try to keep me from suddenly outwardly panicking.\n\nI had to internalize a panic attack from 3pm-7pm.\nAnd now it's nearly 9. And it's all coming out.\n\nI relapsed.\nIt's been a full year since my last severe panic attack.

I was taking a video of the song Earl Grey, and thirty seconds in, she yells into my ear \"if you don't stop recording, I will break your fucking phone.\" The video stops there because I brought my phone down and I think in that moment she slammed my arm down, causing me to drop and yelled \"fuck your phone\" at me. I looked at my friend next to me and wanted to cry. I couldn't hear the lyrics of Earl Grey from a band I'd wanted to see live for years. If I was anybody else, I think I would've confronted her and yelled at her, but, I'm a strong believer in safe environments for punk shows. I believe in letting out your aggression so long as it's *mutual*. I never turned around or looked at that girl in her face once in the show. I walked out of the mosh pit and into the back to a bunch of forlorn looking head bangers and started to tear up, not because I was upset about my broken phone, but that someone wanted to come into this scene and do something so cruel to someone they don't even know. Because someone came into there with the intention of deliberately hurting someone. My friends found me, someone I consider a brother, and I told him what happened. They offered to buy me a tshirt and to get me food, anything to make me feel better. They left the show early with me and we got coffee. All I wanted to say is that people need to be kind to each other. I am so thankful for my friends everyday. Without them, I would be nothing. ",

            "selftext": "I was always good in school, even went to a national competition in 8 th grade in biology. Went into a really good high school where in 2 nd grade my accumulated anxiety started to take away more than give, i stopped studying as much hoping that i would have more time to socialize and maybe try to get a girlfriend (boy were you wrong bruh). I got through high school with a fairly good grades so i was able to get into a good college. On second year of college i had a mental break down, rendering me useless. I feel like i'm learning how to live my life again. In this past 2 years i wasn't able to pass any exam or subject.First year i wasn't able to be physically near college. I simply can't study, not only i can't concentrate or find any motivation. I feel completely crazy, i'm lost and i don't know how to help myself. I did manage to study for an hour or two for number of times but it was really bad. With constant stopping and i couldn't focus, my thoughts wander off and i forget what i'm doing. Actually only thinking about studying makes me want to run away, most of the time i can't even start. I really like knowing things, i'm really curious but with all the grades, the teachers and other students, there's a lot of pressure there. It's too much for me. I know that in the end the thing that will help me is keeping at it and being patient and a bit stubborn but i can't see this happening. Why is it so hard when i actually like it. \n\nFeel free to say what ever you want, i like different opinions. It shows me that it's not all that bad as i see it. \n\nEDIT: Thanks to all of you who shared their thoughts with me, i'm really grateful and i can feel my will for trying and fighting rising. I wish you all the best in dealing with your problems too. Cheers!",

Finally, though, I went to a club meeting that is meant for pre-service teachers. I was hesitant to go at first, figuring that there was no use in going and that it would probably be lame anyways. I was so so wrong. I went yesterday and all the members were SO nice and passionate about teaching. They welcomed me and already considered me a member. They invited me to an event tonight and, at first, I didn't want to go. Again, I was hesitant, but I went anyways. I had a GREAT time. It was a Relay For Life event, since the club does mostly volunteer work. I met new people and even danced-- I never dance. Even at prom I didn't dance, I just stood on the dance floor like an idiot. But this time I danced with everyone and had an amazing time. I talked to people, which I don't usually do when going to new things like this. It takes me a while to warm up to people, but here I just felt so comfortable and eager to meet people. We all exchanged numbers and names, already making plans for the coming week. They were so nice and so welcoming, it was an amazing feeling and, though I am exhausted, I am so glad I went.",

Unaware of anything, never to exist again. And I find it so, so terrifying I go into a panic attack and cry.\n\nI can ignore it most of the time but I can get triggered by films, TV shows, even ask Reddit questions. I think it's the nothingness that scares me, the fear of the unknown and never experiencing anything ever again.

I was sitting in the back seat of a car, and I saw a spot of dirt on the seat in front of me move. I had a panic attack as would be expected. I will not allow myself to fall into insanity because of this, and if it persists I will make plans to take my own life. \n\nMy mother is tired of this shit, and I don't blame her. I don't fucking understand why I can't just use CBT like every other person and fix this.

            "selftext": "I saw that someone had posted something similar and I could totally relate and wanted to share my experience. \n\nI started my morning waking up at 5am. I try to wake up at 7 every morning but it's not unusual for me to wake up hours earlier, my body on high alert and bombarded with negative thoughts and worries racing through my head. I sat in bed for 2 hours, worrying about the medication I was about to take. I worried that it would make me lose my mind or I would turn into a maniac. I took it anyway.\n\nAfter a couple of hours, I noticed a shift already. I still had my anxiety demon spewing negative thoughts at me, but I could rationalize them and put them to the side. I thought, \"Is this what 'normal' is?\" I had become so accustomed to anxiety that it seemed normal to me and I just figured everyone always felt this way too. But this must be how 'normal' people feel.\n\n1. In Spanish class, we learned a mnemonic device that had the word \"death\" in it. Normally, I would start thinking about death and how I'm afraid of death and possibly suicide ideation. I'd spiral into thinking about how everyone will be dead one day and picture myself old with all of my friends and family deceased and how lonely I am. My brain suggested this thinking, but I was able to say, \"No, thank you. I'd rather not think about that.\"\n\n2. The cafeteria at school used to be overwhelming, but now I felt comfortable. I felt at ease and had the desire to socialize for once. I wasn't worried about how my teeth looked (they are slightly crooked but it's unnoticable to others). \n\n3. When thinking about the future, I felt okay. I didn't picture myself being miserable or failing at everything. I felt confident that things would be okay.\n\n4. While going on a hike with my boyfriend, I realized I had never called my mom back and I hadn't talked to her in days. My phone was in his car. I worried my mom thought I hated her. My boyfriend was worried because normally if I worry about something, it goes downhill from there. I said, \"Nevermind, it's okay. I can let this go for now.\" And my mind moved onto other things. My boyfriend was amazed because never has he seen me like this.\n\n5. I heard two of my boyfriend's friends say the word \"anxiety\" during math class. Normally I would've freaked out and assumed they were talking about me and my boyfriend had told them things about me I didn't want him to. I let it go and realized how impractical that was. I later realized they were talking about some athlete.\n\n\nThese are just a few of the changes I've observed, but I am quite amazed so far.",

I went to the Dr. today!\n\nIt was extremely difficult just to go and I was a wreck the whole time.  The nurse and Dr. were just the best very understanding the nurse even got me an ice pack I was sweating so bad.  I explained to the Dr. that my anxiety has been getting progressively worse the last few months, I've always had social anxiety but been able to muscle through it, but I haven't been able to go to the grocery store or any big store for months and I had a panic attack yesterday while training a new employee at work.  I got half way through the training and I just had to go I couldn't control it.  I talked to my parents and made an appointment for the Dr.  I've been dreading since I made the call.  \n\nIts been a few hours since I left the Dr. and I'm still a little shaky but I'm feeling very positive.  My parents are incredibly supportive and loving and I can't express my appreciation.  They are not very stoked that I was prescribed meds, but I'm optimistic that the meds will be a more or less short term solution.  I did talk to the Dr. about therapy and I will be getting a hold of a therapist shortly. \n\nThe Dr. prescribed me Paroxetine 10mg to take daily and Lorazepam 0.5mg to take when I have panic attacks.  I'm going to start meditation and yoga today and work on it everyday.   I've already taken my dog out for a walk today and it felt good.  \n\nIf anyone is struggling with getting the courage to get help I completely understand.  I tried to go by myself and I couldn't I had to have my mom come with me and that helped sooooo much.  Heck just thinking about the appointment give me anxiety.  But its over I did!  I'm so proud of myself :D and I know anyone in similar situation will feel much better after.  If you need to talk to someone I'm here or you can pm me :D \n\nThank you all for reading and being such a supportive community to each other.      \n\nBtw I'm 29 M and I kept singing this song in my head while waiting for the Dr.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oKsxPW6i3pM\n\nThe waiting is sooo hard!\n\n&lt;3",
