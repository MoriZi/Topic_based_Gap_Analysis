I feel nothing -- I've gotten to that point where I'm panicking so hard I go numb. It's like my body can't handle it so it just -- stops. Feels nothing. I don't care about any of this. I can't. It feels like if I do, I'll die. I'm overwhelmed, shutting down and afraid it'll only get worse. Every day I don't function I'm just falling further and further behind on my work, so I panic even more, so I shut down even harder.\n\nDamn it. I can recognize this cycle of anxiety, this pattern. I know what I'm doing to myself, but I feel like I can't stop it from happening. Any advice? I don't know what to do. Words of encouragement are also appreciated. Take care.",

            "selftext": "You know how there is often this sense of fear at the back of your mind? That no matter how well things are going, there is a small voice that says: \"Watch out, bad things are happening! Never let your guard down!\"\n\nThat voice is what kept our ancestors alive. Our brains have a preprogrammed tendency to pay attention to the negative, to danger and trouble, and that is in part what fuels our anxiety.\n\nThe good news is that underneath our experience there is also an underlying sense of OK-ness, alrightness. While you may be stressed out or upset, there is a foundation of awareness that runs deeper than any temporary fear, like a quiet sea bed hundred feet below a howling storm.\n\nIn fact, take a close look at this moment, right now. You are probably alright: No one is attacking you, you are not falling or drowning, there is no immediate crisis. Your experience might be far from perfect, and it might include unpleasant thoughts or emotions, but right this moment at least, you are basically okay.\n\nThere are of course times when you are not okay. Sometimes you are in real danger, your body is hurting, someone is mistreating you or your mind is in full panic mode.  But I bet that during any given day, you can find a half a dozen or a dozen moments where you can honestly say, \"Yeah, right now I'm okay\". \n\nNotice and savor those experiences! You are not trying to convince yourself of anything or trying to cover of your suffering under a thin varnish of \"positive thinking\". You are simply becoming aware of the fact that you are not under threat, in danger or harmed. Experiencing this over time, again and again, will gradually change your brain an help you become calmer and stronger.\n\n*Adapted from Rick Hanson's Just One Thing.*",

            "selftext": "I've had generalized anxiety disorder since I was 8 years old and still struggle with it now, at 17. I've always been bad at sports and PE has been a source of anxiety to me for years. For the last 3 years or so I've always had very kind and understanding teachers, so it's not been as much of a problem for me anymore. But this year I have the worst PE teacher there currently is at my school.\n\nI actually don't have to participate in PE anymore since last year because of health and anxiety issues, and my previous teacher was fine with this. My new teacher however, demanded a confirmation from my school counselor, and I was planning on getting that next week because I have an appointment with her then anyways.\n\nAt the beginning of class last friday, I asked my teacher if I had to help with anything or if I could leave and make homework. She turned towards me and told me I had to participate because she hadn't received a confirmation from my counselor yet. I explained the above to her, that I'd hand it in next week, but she said I still had to participate.\n\nThis gave me a massive surge of anxiety, because I wasn't expecting it at all. I walked with my class to the running track but felt a panic attack coming up and I asked my teacher \"Could I please go to my counselor, I have anxiety disorder and feel like I'm going to have a panic attack, and I have clear instructions that I have to go to her if I'm feeling like this.\" She turned to me (I was already in tears and hyperventilating), and told me I was irritating her and she's very disappointed in me for not participating. This, of course, made my panic attack even worse. My friend saw what was happening and tried to help me, but my teacher barked at her that she had to go back to the rest of the class.\n\nShe let me leave after telling me again how disappointed she was in me, and the lady at the front office and my counselor were baffled when I told them what happened.\n\nI'm just so angry about how heartlessly she handled the situation. Normally when I ask a teacher I want to go see my counselor, it's expected of them that they'll let me go without me even having to explain myself. I'm in the school's special care program and everything. And even if that wasn't the case, why the f*ck would any adult in their right mind not let a panicking student go get help for themselves.\n\n*TL;DR - Asshole PE teacher didn't allow me to go to my school's counselor when I got a panic attack in class, and told me she was irritated by me, making the situation even worse.*",

I thought... Oh god, it must be because I don't feel like I deserve love and so I spend money to make up for it and as an apology for who I am oh no!! But then I remembered occum's razor and I thought what could the simplest explanation be?\n\nTurns out I'm just bad with money, and this girl happens to be a great excuse to spend some. Treats for her and treats for me, guilt free! Haha, I felt so much better after realizing that this is the more likely reason. \n\nSo sometimes, when you're starting to internally panic, see what the simpler explanation could be. I'm learning that the more likely explanations are also usually the ones that don't warrent panic or high levels of anxiety.",

            "selftext": "I graduated college five months ago and have not gotten a job because I'm really terrified of my anxiety. \nI know that the past two jobs I've had caused me severe anxiety every day. I know that college caused four years of unrelenting, physically incapacitating anxiety. And, I know that once I get a job, it will be back in full force. \n\nFor the past five months, though I've been depressed, it has been a massive relief to just not be worried about anything. No racing thoughts, no dread, no sleepless nights, no anxiety attacks. I've been able to focus on my physical health and it's been great. \n\nI just feel so lousy about not having a job. I feel paralyzed. I want to do SOMETHING with my life. But I also don't want to go back to the hell of having severe anxiety 24/7. \n\nJust a venting post. Thanks for reading.",
