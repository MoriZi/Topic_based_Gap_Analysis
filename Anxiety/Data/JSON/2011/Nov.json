            "selftext": "I am a very imaginative person, able to deliberately visualize and lose myself in an inner world of manipulating objects, colors, sounds, textures, etc in my mind.  I can play with them like some kind of futuristic, holographic CAD system, changing and testing things out until I figure out a good methodology. That means when I finally create something new with my hands, it can sometimes like someone with a lot of experience actually did the work.  (I've unfortunately never made a career out of that ability, though).\n\nI guess having a multi-dimensional imagination like that is like a double-edged sword.   I am slowly starting to realize that a lot of my \"processor cycles\" (I like using computer terminology to describe my brain) are burned up on imagining conversations with abusive people.  I seem to be constantly practicing, practicing, practicing strategies on what I'd say to them.  \n\nIf they say X to me, I figure out a clever Y verbal strategy for it.  Then I keep mentally refining my strategy as I continue to drive, to attempt to do housework, or whatever is in front of me.  This, of course, screws up my ability to sleep.  \n\nI've always battled this inner battle as just part of my inner mental background noise.  I've never really considered it's implications in the front of my brain before.  Kinda like being a fish raised in polluted water trying to consider what clear, healthy water might actually feel like.\n\nIn a way, much of that effort is wasted, because I never thought to write down my snappiest, best verbal comebacks and defenses.  I know I have come up with some pretty clever stuff in the past and it's wasted with the fact that my memory just can't remember all those strategies.  That's a hell of a lot of perfectly good \"processor cycles\" wasted on trying to fight verbally/emotionally abusive people which my anxious subconscious constantly conjures up for me to fight.\n\nI am in a relationship, and my very gentle, concerned SO sometimes comments: \"Are you in pain?  You look like you are in pain!\"  My responses have been anywhere between being reactively mean/snappish to a confused \"I don't know, I'm just sitting here/washing dishes/etc.\"  \n\nIt's starting to slooooooowly sink in that there often seems to be a coincidence between when I am in the heat of fighting that mental battle with whenever that feedback is told to me.  \n\nI used to fantasize a lot about physical revenge too, but when I confided to my SO about that, I got feedback that is absolutely not healthy.  So I've mentally toned that down somewhat.  Still not giving it up completely.\n\nThe thing is... (a) I don't have any verbal abusive people in my life right now because I've given up having many friends and (b) the rare times when a verbally abusive person DOES come along, they often come up with a verbal tactic I hadn't considered yet.  If they've succeeded in hurting me, that's another fight that keeps running over and over in the back of my brain.\n\nGrowing up in a family from hell, you simply don't have much of an emotional feel for what's normal/healthy and ya take so much negative stuff for granted.  \n\nI keep desperately NEEDING to fight this fight inside.  As long as you can keep up the fight, you don't have to accept that you've lost the war.  \n\nI feel like an old soldier of a conquered country.  The battle is gone into history. The abusers from the other side have already have already had their satisfaction from their sadistic game of hurting their POW victim and enjoying his/her cries of pain.  They've already left, laughing and enjoying the physical and mental triumph of crushing the humanity of their victim.   \n\nThe old soldier still wants to keep fighting the war, even as he/she is not physically or mentally capable of it anymore.  The old soldier just can't accept that they've already won.  \n\nI'm officially labeled as disabled now because they've won.  I don't want to know this... I don't want to feel this...  if I give up this mental fight, I am going to feel like someone who was brutally raped, mentally speaking.  It would be the ultimate defeat. I don't want to believe it, I don't want to feel it, I don't want to let it sink in to my brain that they've actually, utterly, completely won.  :'-(\n\nIs there anyone else out there who is like this?\n\n(For the record, I've been in therapy for a bunch of years.  My current therapist is amazingly clued and effective but expensive, so I only get to see her maybe once a month at best.)\n\nEDIT: Holy CRAP this was long.  I'm too tired to do a TL;DR, sorry.  \nFor those who read it, thanks for listening.\n\nEDIT2:  (6 hours later)  A small bit of progress... I felt my subconscious starting one of those accusation dialogs today and instead of engaging in it, I said \"that's your opinion\" and kept going.  I kinda felt like a more mature person in that moment.  I can still feel it happening on a more non-verbal level, but I'll take any progress that I can get.\n\nEDIT3:  A week later...  looks like talking about it has helped me to be able to start noticing the arguments and decide not to engage more and more.  I like being able to talk about my problems here.  :)",

I have always been very thin, since I was a child. My mom was thin when she was young, so was my aunt, and so was my grandma. Every time I go to the doctor I get blood test and they always come back fine. I got teased a lot as a kid about how skinny I was and I'm just starting to like my body and feel comfortable with it. \n\n\nI was seeing a new psychologist today because I am out of my anti anxiety medication, which allows me to function like a normal human being.\n\nNot even 5 minutes after I walk into the room he says, \"you have anxiety because you are underweight.\" He did not ask what triggers my anxiety, or when it started or try to actually understand my situation. He looked at my body and decided he knew what was wrong with me. It was like middle school all over again.\n\nI know for a fact I do not have an eating disorder, or if I do then almost everyone I know also has an eating disorder. I eat three meals a day with snacks in between. I don't think about my weight or keep track of it, I don't even own a scale. But I am thin. Therefore, according to him, I have an eating disorder and that's why I'm sick.\n\n\nMy denial of having an eating disorder was just evidence that I had one because people who have an ED deny having an ED.\n\nYou know who else denies having EDs? People who don't have EDs.\n\nBut he was the doctor, so he knew best. Because he was a \"Good Doctor\" who \"didn't take that.\" That being the patient actually trying to describe their perfectly healthy eating habits. I made the mistake of saying that I was vegetarian. welp, there's a restricted diet, clearly I have an ED.\n\nI started crying because I was so frustrated that he outright refused to accept what I had to say. He didn't even want to hear about how I ate. Because my diet is irrelevant to diagnosis an eating disorder. He started saying, why did you lose weight before being hospitalized? (I was highly stressed, it happens). And he just started saying things that weren't even true, like my records said I had irregular periods (I don't) and he even brought up that I got a pregnancy test (My period was 3 days late and I overreacted, on account of how regular it normally was).\n\nThen he finally wrote up my prescription, saying \"this is what you want, right?\" Like I was some drug addict trying to get a fix and not a sick person who wanted medication.\n\nI came out of the office in tears and felt awful. I had been feeling positive and actually happy before I saw him. Now I feel awful and ugly and voiceless. I want to eat a gallon of ice cream just to spite him.\n\nThe worst part is he probably thinks I got upset because I didn't want to admit that I had an ED, not that he was judgmental and dismissive. He probably think he did a god job today.",

I have had problems with my anxiety since I was five, but I would say just four years ago I was able finally call it anxiety. I'm good 80% of the time, deal with it on my own, don't let it affect my daily life, tell no one. No big deal. Now the 20% of the time it's either debilitating and I just need to stay home, or I need to have some one talk to me. It's just nice to either be in my comfort zone or have some one know how I'm feeling. \n\nThe problem here is my mom. She doesn't understand, and is not really trying to. Many times if I tell her I am feeling anxious she asks me why. Cool, good question but sometimes I just am and she doesn't get that. Or she'll tell me to get a hold of myself, again, not something I didn't know needed to be done, and not the most constructive answer. I've been to therapy twice and feel that I know how to cope for the most part, it's just some times too much. No big deal in my opinion, I'm not perfect, sometimes I lose. I just don't know how to convey to my mother what I am feeling, she things I can just snap out of it by telling myself to stop. She just doesn't get it, to the point of getting pissed off at me when I need to just relax. I have never been good at explaining this to people. \n\nHow do you guys explain things like this to those close to you?",

            "selftext": "For the better part of the latter half of my life (I am 18 now) i've always tended to avoid people, and as a result, never really learned to interact around them. I used to have very strong physical symptoms that were a clear mark of anxiety (fast heartbeat, inability to speak, etc.) back at around 14-15, however I now never get them.\n\nHowever, I do still avoid people, and I suspect that it's those symptoms that i've been really avoiding all this time enough for me to never get into a position into which they can manifest. I'm never internally anxious, but I regularly do things like wait in line for half an hour, only to leave at the last possible moment because I didn't want to talk to the person at the counter. I get a sort of euphoric thrill from walking away after that, as well as a tinge of disappointment, but somewhat exhilarated that my suspicions that that was what I was going to do was verified. Sometimes I wait in lines anyway even though I don't wish to buy anything because i've arrived too early for class and don't want to be the only one there. And then I realize how stupid the entire endeavor is, and realize that it's kind of sad. Neither do I attend any social functions (I stopped long ago) and do not wish to. Although I do wish I could enjoy them (perhaps as someone vastly different from myself).\n\n\nPart of this is my fear of unpredictability. When I try to do something new I like to visualize what I am going to be doing so I may be sure of how I would act in the situation. I've tried seeking help at my college's counselling services, however, I literally have no idea how I would make the jump from going in the door to meeting someone who I have no idea of. I've circled the building numerous times trying to get up the courage to walk in the door, only to leave and walk away later on. They do have a phone, but I can't work up calling them for the same reasons.\n\nI talk to myself a lot of times and make up stories to keep me company. Most of the time they're based on people I meet (or rather, see, I can never get to talk to them due to my lack of confidence and awkwardness), and they often end up as a replacement for what normally would be loneliness. They're utterly predictable of course, since I made them up after all, and any anxiety is naturally absent from them, but every real confrontation runs contrary to my expectations since there is a certain element of the real that triggers a flight response.  \n\nSometimes I don't see why I should ever bother, when I can simply populate my mind with imaginary people who I can control, and entertain myself further with books and videogames. I feel like I can just slowly wither away doing so, knowing I can just off myself should I ever get into a position where there is no longer anything to sustain me in real life. I consider it sometimes, though i've made no concrete plans, but knowing I would have no compulsion in doing so. \n\n\nThe only two things I have that would normally be a plus would be the fact that my parents have more than enough to financially support me for life (with the implication of course that I would never have to work for myself, and never get into a position of absolute poverty that i'd have to work my ass up off and be forced to commune with society) and that i'm relatively intelligent, which only makes me feel more stupid for not being able to act or think when faced with unpredictable situations, and ensuring that unless I deliberately sabotage my studies i'd never fail.\n\nIt's the latter or an attempted failed suicide attempt that i've paradoxically considered as my rational options in my situation to better myself in the long run, enough so that i'd get help without my having to seek it. I'm aware that it's a hopeless cry for help that would get my no sympathy for such an obviously irrational action. Really, I don't know what to do, and am out of options, and am aware that no one can directly help me, that in the end, I have to do it myself. I'm afraid that I can't, and i'll have to be pushed into doing something I don't want to for my own good. I feel like I have to somehow desperately prove to myself that there is something wrong with me that I haven't chosen to do, because I can't shake the feeling of responsibility for how i've chosen my life to turn out the way it did, and the absence of any internal evidence (because I am avoiding it) gives me the notion that what I have is nothing more fake than what I made up, a convenient storyline of a mental disorder to justify the route of my life.\n\nMore likely, though, i'm just going to do the same things i've been doing for the past 8 years of my pitiful school life, and in the future, am going to return to the same notions I have now, when pushed enough to an edge to consider voicing out myself, knowing that i'd let out just enough pressure to keep me going for a few more years of the same.\n\n\nI apologize for being extremely pessimistic to anyone who may read this and end up believing that anything I say makes rational sense. It doesn't, and no one should ever be like me.",

I regularly post to r/anxiety under my normal username, and I'm quite active here. :)\n\nTomorrow, I'm going to be the guest speaker on an anxiety support group conference call. Aaaanyone can join...I'll be talking about my panic disorder, anxiety, agoraphobia, other phobias (probably a bit about emet), and the like. \n\nEveryone is welcome to introduce themselves on the phone call &amp; chat a little bit about what makes them anxious and what kind of struggles you've been going through recently...but you don't have to talk if you don't want to. You can just sit back and listen. :)\n\nThe phone # is 1-559-546-1700. Then, enter 640024#. It's a California area code, but if you have nationwide calling on your cell (which everyone seems to have nowadays), you should be fine. Or, call from your Google Voice account if you think you'll have cell issues.\n\nHope some of you can make it! I listened in on the call last month and it was really nice to feel connected with strangers across the US who share all of my anxious quirks.\n\nEdit: **6pm EST! Sorry about that!**\n\nEdit #2: The call is finished! Thanks to any of you who joined. :) Next call is on Sunday, December 11th at 6 pm EST.",

Then I feel embarrassed for abandoning my thread and *really* don't want to go back and look.  Then I wonder why I posted at all...\n\nSimilar things made me quit WoW after trying unsuccessfully to get into it.  I loved Final Fantasy games, and the idea of my party members being actual people cooperating sounded great.  But I realized it was just never going to be fun for me, since bringing myself to join a PUG and withstand the inevitable criticism (I was a noob and stayed that way due to not PUGging) was a huge effort.  Maybe this speaks to the immaturity of WoW players but it also speaks to my anxiety in online interactions.\n\nAnyway, I get the impression that most people with social anxiety IRL don't have it online.  Is this true?  Does anyone have tips on dealing with what I'm talking about?  (And yes, I realize the irony of making this post.)",

I have a huge pile of work to do and only a couple of weeks before the end of the semester. Everytime I try to sit and do work or think about the work I have to do I have a panic attack. Sometimes they will be at random. At this point I don't want to try and do my work because It will just cause me more problems. Sometimes I will not be able to sleep or wake up in the morning unable to breathe. Despite this my counselor and Assistant principal want me to go on an attendance contract. If I break this contract there could be potential legal action taken against my mother which stresses me out even more. All in all, I'm having anxiety which is causing to miss school. Missing school has resulted in a pile of work that I have little time to finish which causes me more anxiety. I'm still waiting to see psychiatrist. I am a freshman and this is certainly not the way I want to start my high school career. I am also currently on Zanex which the doctor said to take as needed. I have only taken it twice because I have heard it can be very addictive.
