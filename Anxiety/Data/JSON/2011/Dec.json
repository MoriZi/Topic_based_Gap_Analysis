            "selftext": "\"Thoughts.\"  I quoted that purposefully, because \"thoughts\" are the key to many (if not the vast majority of) people's anxiety.  Over the past 50 years or so, researchers have discovered connections between feelings/emotions, healthy and unhealthy, and thoughts.   People with feelings of anxiety, depression, anger, etc. had similar types of thoughts.  \n\nSo researchers tried something pretty novel - they said \"fuck asking a person about mom and dad, let's see if we can directly challenge a person's thoughts and see if that affects feelings/emotions.\"  \n\nHere's what they found: \n\nPeople with feelings of anxiety, fear, and panic, nearly always have thoughts that they are in danger, and it can be any kind at all; danger of losing social status, being rejected, being physically harmed, having an illness, losing a job, dying, or even danger of becoming anxious (fear of fear).  Your mind creates the danger, whether it actually exists or not, and it is unable to distinguish between real danger and imagined or perceived danger.  The physical reaction you have is identical when you have mere 'thoughts' of danger as it is to the reaction if an actual lion were standing before you ready to chomp. \n\nInterestingly, people with feelings of sadness, helplessness, and depression nearly always have thoughts that they have lost something irretrievably, while feelings of anger are connected with thoughts that things are not as they \"should\" be, according to your idea, and that things \"should\" be different. \n\nResearchers then discovered that people with unhealthy levels of sadness, anxiety, guilt, shame, anger, etc. all seemed to have **irrational, unsupported, untrue, and otherwise illogical** thoughts of the types I just mentioned.  For example, an anxious person had thoughts of something dangers, and those thoughts were irrational, illogical, and sometimes really off-the-wall with no basis in reality.  \n\nSo the researchers set out to help people **identify their thoughts, challenge them, and modify them.**\n\nHere's a neat example of how thoughts, whether empirically true or not, can have monumental impacts on your emotions: \n\n*Your coworker calls to tell you that the lottery ticket you bought is the winner - $200 million, divided among 5 people.  You're ecstatic, your mind racing with thoughts of paying off debt, helping others, taking relaxing vacations, and buying that coveted Reddit-monogrammed leather miniskirt you always admired.  But your coworker got it wrong.  She looked at last week's winning numbers, and this week, you didn't win.*\n\nObjectively, you were never a millionaire.  You won nothing.  But the \"thought\" of it, without having a single dollar in your hands, without paying off any debt or taking any vacations, made you happy.  There was no connection between truth and reality and your thoughts and connected emotions. \n\nHere's an example of how anxiety tends to work: \n\n*You are going to a party, and you just **know** you're going to say something stupid to someone, and everyone will laugh at you and talk about you for years.  You may even become so embarrassed that your name is forever linked with social-failure, the old \"Munson\" syndrome.*\n\nThis thought is completely illogical and irrational, yet your body physiologically reacts as if you actually, truly are in danger of losing respect, being vilified, and having people look down upon you for eternity.\n\nCognitive Behavioral Therapy teaches people to identify their feelings and emotions, search for the \"thoughts,\" and then challenge those thoughts using various methods.  These methods include: \n\n* directly analyzing the truth/falsity of your thoughts by writing them and reviewing them\n* challenging the truth/falsity by doing something, like actually going to the party and seeing if you end up universally vilified forever\n* digging into the foundation for the thoughts, by searching for underlying fears and concerns and then challenging those. \n\n\nI thought I'd share this with all, because I spent years working on anxiety before researching CBT and reading books about it, and it can change your life. \n\n**EDIT**:  Thought I'd share another few postings on this subject with another Redditor.  http://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/ntbu0/anxiety_attack/c3byymn?context=3\n\n",

            "selftext": "I've had a rough semester so most people understand my apprehension but nobody really knows how long I've gone without going to class. My Sociology/History classmates ask me when they see me if I've dropped out of the course but I just say I've been too sick to go. History I have an A+ in because it's all lecture and I've completed both essay assignments and the first exam and the lectures are online, so it's a zero-effort class. Sociology is similar. What I'm truly worried about is Precalculus, which I'm failing and have only attended twice in two months. Every time I wake up on time to go to class I have this overwhelming anxiety that forces me to hide in my room for most of the day. Sometimes I don't come out for days, and I don't eat. I worry that my effort to recover from my surgery, strep, and bronchitis is futile and that there is nothing I can do to bring my grade back up. My teacher won't admit that she is partially at fault for not answering my emails when I was ill. The syllabus does say that there are no makeup quizzes (the majority of our grade) unless there is prior notification, which she had plenty from me. All she said when I met with her was that I had to pass the final with at least a B to get a D in the class. She claimed that her computer was broken for 3 days and that is why she didn't get my emails and that she will not honor them. It upset me so much because I was prepared for them, and now I've gone into a deep depression and become agoraphobic because I think that there is nothing I can do. My biggest concern is having to show my parents my final grades. I had to drop one course already after my surgery, and now this. Oh and another fun thing I deal with: I have so much anxiety  over speaking about my anxiety that I won't go to counseling. Every time I have to go in that building I get nauseated. I need some serious help. Right now talking to people on the internet is my only solace.",

            "selftext": "I am a 24 year old female and I have lived with anxiety since at least first grade. This was my earliest recollection regarding my symptoms manifesting. I have a fear about being somewhere where I wouldn't be able to access a bathroom quickly. \n\nSome examples include road trips and being stuck in a car,  that period of ten minutes on an airplane where you can't get up, being on any crowded places (bars on the weekends, concerts, popular restaurants) where there are a lot of people... Because where there are a lot of people, there will probably be a long line for the restroom.\n\nMy brain over thinks everything and I end up spiraling down into my dark hole of anxiety. I think that I have to use the bathroom immediately, and that if I don't find one, I WILL soil myself. Throughout my life, it had changed from nausea (gagging and dry heaving) to ther feeling of needing to urinate to the feeling of defecation. I also experience gas and stomach pains when anxious. It has gotten so bad in college that I've had panic attacks and couldn't go to class because I was scared I'd have to go to the bathroom while walking there. \n\nI've seen a couple of therapists who have basically said I will have to just learn to live with it. My new insurance sucks and doesn't cover psych, so my therapist had offered to keep going by just paying her my copay. Although that is nice, I feel like a burden because she could be helping someone else and getting money for it.\n\nHere is some background: i grew up in an Asian household with somewhat strict parents (not as bad as usually portrayed) and I am from a large metropolitan city. I went to UC Berkeley and majored in molecular biology. My mother has the exact same fear as I do, though hers is probably one tenth as bad as mine. I am/was working with a therapist that my parents are tied to my anxiety, and it has helped.\n\nThe biggest anxiety test of my life is coming up in two weeks. I am going to Japan (with my soon to be in laws-which puts even more anxiety on me) to visit my fiance's family who doesn't speak any English. There will be a lot of traveling where a bathroom is inaccessible and I need to hide my anxiety because I don't want them to see how bad it is.  I'll literally be in every situation that I find scary as hell - plane ride, train rides, large gatherings, etc. all while trying to impress his family.\n\nMy tools:\n-I've bought adult incontinence pads, kind of as a backup.\n-Ativan-this makes me sleepy and often times I can't remember what happened while I was on it. So I would prefer not to use it if I can help it.\n\nThe questions I pose to you, Reddit, are:\n-how do you get yourself out from the spiraling effect of anxiety? I've tried breathing, talking to myself, affirming myself that I'm ok. Although it works sometimes, it isn't a go-to technique for me.\n\n-does anybody else feel \"trapped\" when there isn't access to a bathroom?\n\n-please teach me any techniques you have when you feel a panic attack coming.\n\n-are there any suggestions about what my SO can do to help me? He has absolutely no idea what it feels like and I can tell he is lost and has no idea how to support me. \n\nThank you for reading my wall of text. I wish I knew someone in real life who knows exactly what it feels like to go through my poisonous train of thoughts.\n\nTl;dr: I have anxiety when I don't have immediate access to a bathroom, I feel the urge to barf/poo/pee in addition to panic attack symptoms. Going on a trip to Japan where there will be lots of sightseeing and transportation (= no bathroom) all while trying to not embarrass myself. What the hell do I do?!",

I've been on five different medications for it, and I'm not sure if any really work.\u00a0\n\nI don't get out and socialize a lot, although I work in an area where i deal with customer on a minute to minute basis. I'm very polite and cheerful, but when alone or stressed, worries stack up and emotion tends to scale very high.\u00a0\n\nI've tried dating a lot, but most people either stop talking to me, or feel I have too much anxiety. When out on a date, I worry about a lot, especially if I've upset my date. I've been sent to a psych ward for this happening actually.\u00a0\n\nThoughts really get to me a lot. It's hard to break a negative chain, though I know how to put on a mask and help people at work. People usually notice something is up, but not enough to be critical. My friend says I know how to fool doctors, as she thinks their diagnosis of who I am seems very off base.\u00a0\n\nAnxiety's really affecting my life, and I can't keep living like this.

I'm worried about money problems, my parents' divorce, employment issues, church obligations, social situations, being out of shape and overweight, being depressed, being lonely. And yet there's another side, too. Sometimes I just won't care about any of these things. I just try to slide by everything. Nothing is important, nothing matters because I'm so utterly worthless. Sometimes these feelings happen within hours of each other.\n\nI'm in a new town, don't know even how to go about getting a doctor, scared to death of actually going to see one, have no money to pay for anything, plus I don't know if I actually want to get help. I'm afraid I'll do it wrong somehow. I'm afraid I won't say the right things. I never say the right things. And I've never really thought myself worth helping. I'll probably just waste any help I'm given. \n\nI don't know if I actually want anyone to respond to this. It makes me feel, well, anxious.",

            "selftext": "I have been dealing with some major anxiety as of late and one of the MAJOR ways my anxiety manifests itself is by me losing my appetite.  This has nothing to do with wanting to be thin or food restircting, it is as if I am so stressed I feel like I can not hold food down, or even swallow it!  Even the smell of food makes me woozy.  I dont want to not eat.  I want to eat and stay healthy, I want to be healthy.  If you have delt with this and have any tips please share.\n\nEDIT:thanks all.  I have an appt with my therapist in the near future so hopefully that will help.  I was able to hold doen some fruit and lots of water, BIG THANKS!\n\n",
