            "selftext": "&gt;Before I was diagnosed with anxiety, I used to explain to my friend that I was in constant battle with my body. He said that he had no idea what I was talking about and asked me to describe it, below is the explanation of what it feels/felt like for me to live every day. \n\n\n*What I feel every day:*\n\n* Every morning you wake up feeling like you just **drank three cups of coffee**. Your nerves are **humming** and you feel awake to the point where you are *almost* dizzy. \n\n* I want you to take a deep breath in your chest, breathe half out, then another one in that is deeper, the half out again, then in even deeper, then half out again. Now, breathe out all the way and before breathing regularly again, feel what your lungs feel like. They should **feel slightly strained** and maybe you are now more conscious of your heart. You should find it **hard to relax**, like you just ran a short sprint. This is what it feels like for me to breathe **every day**. \n\n* Do you remember how your stomach felt when you ate something that **disagreed with you** (or how it felt when you were sick). That's what my stomach feels like every time I eat **anything**. \n\n* Now I want you to think of that thing you did the other day or week that you are not proud of. Perhaps you yelled at someone you loved when they didn't deserve it, maybe you accidentally hit a car, reacted without thinking, perhaps you simply forgot to do your homework or made a mistake on a test. Think about what you did. **Keep thinking about it, running it over and over in your head.** If the event was strong enough, you should be feeling some sort of **guilt, shame, or general \"bad\" feeling about yourself.** Now try to stop thinking about it. If you are having trouble stopping, because of that feeling you are having, that is what I experience **every day**, except the feeling is there without any known cause. *Think about how confusing your world would be to **feel shame** most of the time **without knowing why**.*\n\n* Finally, you need to be constantly terrified of losing control. **Terrified of the fear**. Afraid that you will get a panic attack again.  Each twitch of your body out of the ordinary scares you because it means that you *might* be panicking. Sometimes you'll hold your breath and wish it goes away, and that just makes it worse. Your **fear of your fear** creates a panic attack, and you sit there helpless watching your body and mind spiral out of control.\n\n&gt;If you want to share how anxiety feels for you every day I would love to hear it. Or if you have a better way of describing it to people, because one thing I think most people don't understand is that we aren't making this up. We aren't just \"imagining\" pain: it actually hurts. \n",

            "selftext": "Hi all - \n\nI posted a week or so ago about being forced (due to financial hardship) to discontinue my Lexapro treatment.  I've been without for about 5 days now, having only taken a pill on Monday and experiencing a rollercoaster ride of anxiety and depression for most of the day.  The past few have been up and down as well.\n\nOne symptom that I've noticed coming back - and by far the most troubling for me - is a dissociation that I experience.  I haven't dealt with it in a long time, as meds have definitely gotten rid of it, but here it is creeping back again - quite badly today.  \n\nIt isn't that I can't function - I can work quite fine.  However I have a hard time bringing thoughts to the surface, and the entire world feels like it's a little less real than it used to be.  I'm not quite \"with it,\" and attempts to engage people or activities feel miles away.  Couple that with a healthy dose of dizziness and a wee bit of nausea and everything kinda sucks.  \n\nHas anyone else experienced this kind of thing?  Am I just whipping myself into a GAD-induced frenzy of anxiety and panic?",

(I guess that\u2019s counter productive as far as list making goes let me correct that.)\nTo be socially FUCKING RADIANT AND AWESOME. i.e. I step into a room and suddenly shit is more awesome.\nMoney.\n\nIt seems like that green paper makes the world go round, as I cannot escape the confines of my home without it. Unless I were to suddenly become homeless or go live in a halfway house where I would transit my white ass all across the phoenix metro area to a phone job I will hate. Solution? Holy shit.\nWhy not just do that?\nBecause stepping outside my front door makes me feel like I\u2019m dying.\nIt\u2019s the world really. No, actually, the world is GREAT AND BEAUTIFUL. Let me correct.\nIt\u2019s PEOPLE. Fucking people man. They are all lying assholes who will rape every shred of confidence, happiness and comfort; all whilst mind fucking and using and being generally very human (selfish) their way through whomever is in their path.\n\nI\u2019m not so cynical to believe this is how every person must be. Sure, others leave, and maybe even die, but there are some really awesome people out there I\u2019m sure.\n\nIt\u2019s just doesn\u2019t feel that way when I\u2019m *IN* it. When I\u2019m *IN* it, all I can think of is how I\u2019m going to get out. Escape. Choking. Can\u2019t breathe. Sweating. Dying. Heart racing. Falling to the floor. Can\u2019t think. Going blind. Get. Me. Out. Of. Here.\n\n^That\u2019s how it feels to just run into another human being for me. Going out for groceries? A fucking nightmare.\n\nI don\u2019t think I need someone or something to prove me wrong or somehow \u201cchange\u201d me. I used to think that, there was that one special person or some shit. Naw. I wont romanticize my anxieties and fears.\n\n(I\u2019m smart enough to know what I need to do though.)\nHUZZAH NOT EXPECTING THAT WERE YOU?\nI need to plunge head fucking first into this world and pillage, mob, thrash, crawl, skip, swim, and charge my way through it HEAD FUCKING ON.\n\nNow I just gotta do it\u2026\nI think I\u2019ll stay inside tomorrow.

            "selftext": "I have always been a very nervous/stressed out person, but within the last few years I've noticed things that make me seriously wonder if I could have an anxiety disorder so I wanted to ask people who are actually going through it before considering therapy or something.  First, the smallest task is enough to stress me out. If there is anything I know I need to do (say, an assignment for school) I will absolutely freak out until I get it done to the point where I have made myself sick and I will get chest pains. Second, I am very paranoid. If I'm walking down the street or in a crowd I feel like everyone is looking at me or in my house I'm afraid that people are looking in the windows or are in my house and a variety of other random paranoias. Third, sometimes I feel \"disconnected\" with my body, like my mind and body are two separate things and I am more \"inside\" of my body than a part of it. Things feel very...dreamlike, I guess you could call it, when I get this way. Fourth, I find myself worrying about death a lot. I am only 20, but I constantly imagine myself as very old and near the end of my life and having my loved ones pass away and then eventually I go too. I feel like it will come far too soon and before I'm ready and I think it's the fact that I know its inevitable that is so terrifying but I can't help but think about it and I will start to just completely freak out as if it is happening now. Those are the big things, but I constantly feel like \"something\" is about to happen and I'm always worried about what is going to happen than what is currently happening. Could someone please possibly shed some light on this? Thank you.\n\nEDIT: I forgot to mention that when I get in those \"dreamy\" states sometimes I think about doing things that are just totally not socially acceptable just because I don't feel like I'm in the world I guess...I don't know how to explain it but I know I shouldn't do these things and I never have acted out on them but I still get the thoughts...I know absolutely nothing about anxiety disorders so I just don't know how to handle this or if its something worse than anxiety or what's going on :(",

            "selftext": "**TL;DR: I have had panic/anxiety for 10+ years, and can't leave a 15 mile radius.  Got sick of it decided to fight for my life back, began diet change &amp; exercising, had 30+ pound weight loss, but now have more anxiety than when I accepted defeat and stayed in comfort zone, am now very frustrated.**\n\nI'll try not to be too long winded here.  Even if this generates no responses, I just need to get this off my chest.  I've had anxiety and panic attacks for 10+ years, and am on 150mg of EffexorXR daily. Been to countless specialists, therapists, etc etc.   I'm currently 28 years old, and have been robbed of a lot of wonderful experiences in my life.  The past 3-4 years I just came to accept the fact that anxiety will beat me down no matter how many times I got up.  I've become completely disconnected from friends, spend most of my time at home, but a weird part of me felt better this way.  I didn't experience day-to-day anxiety and panic, and I wasn't depressed or sad.  I also wasn't happy with my lifestyle, but I just seemed to accept my fate.  I could live this way, and wasn't going to poke or prod at the giant elephant in the room, just leave him be.  It crushes me that I really had it all, good grades, great family, etc.  And I had come to a sad, secluded point where I was a human hermit, disconnected and defeated.  My best friend and closest companion was my dog....even typing that crushes me (I love dogs, but that's what my life had come to). \n\nAbout two months ago, I decided to fight back.  It's always been in the back of my mind, but one morning, something clicked.  I was 50 pounds overweight, ashamed to be seen by anyone in public, and had just had enough.  Instead of ignoring the giant elephant in the room, I wanted to pick a fight with it.  My attitude suddenly shifted to the following: Anxiety and panic wants to rob me of a life I deserve? *Fuck that*.  I'm not submitting anymore.  Let's go.\n\nMy diet went from mainly fast food (food was the one thing I had to look forward to every day) to vegetables, lean meats, whole grains, 1600-2k calories a day.  After two weeks, I began walking.  Two weeks later, I began running.  55 days since my lifestyle change, I'm down 30 pounds, have confidence, a base of proper nutrition and daily exercise as a foundation.  I've inspired my family to change as well.  It really has been amazing.  \nThis new attitude + lifestyle has led me to expand my boundaries.  I'm walking long distancing out of safe zones, attending some small family gatherings, and very slowly crawling back to a normal life.  The problem is, my panic and anxiety is fighting back as well.  I now experience day to day anxiety and sometimes small episodes of panic, more so than when I accepted my fate of a hermit's lifestyle.  The further I come along and push my boundaries, the harder the anxiety fights back.  Maybe this should just be obvious to me, but after a small panic episode a few hours ago, I felt a bit defeated.  The doubt creeped back into my mind, that maybe I am destined to a hermit lifestyle.  I don't know.  I just needed a place to get all of this off of my chest, even if it goes unread.  For that I thank you.",

For me, my anxiety is triggered by change of routine, the unknown, and loss of control - basically the exact description of an overseas vacation.  One of the ways it manifests for me is total insomnia which is incredibly frustrating because then you become exhausted and more stressed, and more anxious (cue vicious cycle).

            "selftext": "Hello. :) I'm using a throwaway account here, as the bf is an avid redditor, and I'm sure he would feel embarrassed or hurt to discover that I am asking advice about him. I really need some advice.\n\nHe is 25, and has been diagnosed with social anxiety disorder. He's bee on prozac for at least 5-7 years now, the max dose (60mg?). From what he and his mother have told me, before he started on the meds, he would cut and burn himself, as well as become even more withdrawn and irritable with those around him. I've been with him for about a year and a half, living with him for a year, and I've never seen any symptoms or evidence of these things.\n\nAbout a month ago, he decided he \"felt better now\", and stopped his prozac cold turkey. Things were fine for about a week, and since then, he has started getting irritable and argumentative about things that were never a problem before, speaking to me less, putting me down a little, and spending a lot more time to himself. I have NOT seen any evidence of renewed self harm, so at this point, I don't think this is something to worry about. \n\nAt first I thought that we were simply have some relationship problems that we needed to discuss, stemming from me having difficulties finding employment (which can stress any relationship) but now I'm not so sure. I don't want to force un needed meds on him, but I'm getting worried.\n\nMy question is, how do I discuss this with him without seeming confrontational? I love him very much and want to see him happy and healthy. I've mentioned before that he seems...not himself..lately and that maybe it's because of quitting the prozac, but he brushes the suggestion off. Maybe I came off the wrong way and made it seem confrontational, even though I didn't intend it to be.\n\nAny advice on how to discuss this in a calm, caring maner would be very much appreciated. Thank you so much!",
