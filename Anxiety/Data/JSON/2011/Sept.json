The volunteers would know in advance what they were getting in to: where the event would be (maybe with a building map with entrances/exits and restrooms), the type of work they would do, and how long the event would last. \n\nPerhaps the person leading it could talk a little in the beginning about anxiety and how the participants may be feeling. They could encourage people to discuss their feelings with other volunteers while working. They could remind people of their success so far (they made it to the event!) and talk about the organization the volunteers are helping. \n\nSince the organizers can't necessarily rely on people coming, the volunteer work could be something that is not time dependent like making blankets or sorting donations or assembling care packages. \n\nI would give something like that a try!

I was doing the things I should to calm down when, as I was getting out of my car in the parking garage, I dropped my cell.  It pops into three pieces.\n\nSo i find the main cell immediately.  I find the battery by lying facedown on the parking surface and reachig under the car.  But i cannot find the back of the phone.  I give up and go upstairs, feeling like i dont have time, like i cant deal with it, with my hands all full of my coffee and my work stuff and lunch, and possibly being late.\n\nBut once i had checked in and dropped my things off, I stood up and walked down to the garage again.  I imagined how much headache i would have with a cell phone with no back how it would cost me money, how I would look like a jerk in front of my new boss using a phone with no back.  And all I needed to do was find it.\n\nI went back downstairs, lay on the ground some more, and found it in the shadows.  But i could not reach it.   So i checked in my car for something I could use to extend my reach, and Found my son's toy Darth Vader lightsaber.  \n\ni could not see the back of my phone anymore from where I could reach it, so I lit it up, glowing red and dropped to the ground with the sound of the ightsaber's effects as it moved.  I ran it over the ground like a CSI tech searching for bloodspatter with a UV light.  and i found it.  LIKE A BOSS it felt.\n\n  I was and I am a mess this morning, but I didnt let it freeze me up. now to work!!  ",

My doc said it's more common for people to have attacks in the middle of the night, but I find myself having the worst of it just as I'm about to fall asleep, sometimes I'll be just about to go out for the night when I jump back awake and everything starts again.\n\nI've noticed that I am more likely to fall asleep despite of the anxiety when I have a light on in the room, it makes me feel like a little kid sometimes, but it's somehow comforting. Another thing I do is just getting up for a while, letting my symptoms go away as much as they will and trying again.\n\nDo any of you have this? Are there any solutions you've found?",

            "selftext": "I guess I'll just type out what I'm feeling right now, not sure if anyone wants to read it but whatever. My problems probably sound pretty lame compared to what many others are going through so I'll just feel stupid posting this...\n\nI have struggled with depression on and off all my life since early childhood, and social anxiety too for about 3 or 4 years. I'm 19 now and in college. Everyone says that college is the best time of your life, you'll make lots of friends that you'll know forever and have such a great time. So far it has been miserable for me.\nI hate many things about this town and about my college. I can't put my finger on it, but for some reason the environment just seems to make my depression and social anxiety so much worse. I can't transfer to another school because it's kind of a non-traditional school and the credits usually don't transfer well at all. I have friends but I'm not close to them, I often feel like I am being left out of the group. Last year we were planning on getting a house together and basically they went ahead and got a house without me because the circumstances made it so I couldn't commit to it just yet (they did it earlier than we had planned because they found \"the perfect house\"). So now I live on campus away from everyone, they say I'm welcome to come over any time but to me it just feels weird. Maybe I'm just over analyzing. I do that a lot. Either way, they're not good friends and I know that I should just make new ones but it's so hard for me. I don't know how and social interaction scares the shit out of me. I was hoping that my roommates this year would be potential friends but so far they just sit in their rooms all the time and it makes me feel like I'm the only one living here.\n\nI have a boyfriend who lives about an hour away and he is very supportive. He's the only one I can really be open with about this stuff. My parents divorced last year and my mom got a new boyfriend, he's really cool but ever since she's been with him, things between us haven't been the same. She just has her own life now and that's understandable but it has been a little hard to get used to. So I feel uncomfortable talking with her about this but I could if I had to. My dad is a good person but we aren't very close, he is difficult to communicate with.\n\nOk, I know this has been really unorganized and all over the place...\n\nBasically, I feel like shit and I don't want to be here. I want to be back with my boyfriend but the circumstances just don't allow it, and that wouldn't solve the problem anyway because the real problem to a certain extent is that I am uncomfortable in my own skin. I am just coming to terms with this. For a long time I felt like a confident person but I guess I was just lying to myself. I have tried talking to counselors at school but they were unhelpful and just gave me the numbers of some other counselors that I would have to pay for. To be fair I wasn't comfortable enough to really talk about what was bothering me so maybe it was partially my fault.\n\nAnyway, I don't know what I'm getting at. I just feel so desperate sometimes. Everyone else around me talks about what a great time they're having at college and I just die inside a little bit every time I hear it.\n\nThis might sound kind of pathetic but I was wondering if anyone would be interested in being \"pen pals\" of sorts over email and having an ongoing discussion about our anxiety/depression problems, not necessarily always asking for advice but just venting about it. Preferably someone who can relate to the specific things I'm talking about.",

The answers were very helpful and encouraging. \n\nLet's me ask a related question that appears to be about employment but is actually about social phobia.  [x-post r/Assistance](http://redd.it/k7pfp)\n\nHere's the situation:\n\n* A housebound agoraphobic, 10+yrs plus in the room.  \n* Used to be a genius, fancy pants mathematician type\n* Looking to **earn** (not be given, earn) a very small sum of money. \n* The work interaction should be done online, over text communication. \n* Total work period should be under 20 mins.\n* Low stress work.   Won't make it as a day trader or a fighter pilot. \n* If I have a panic attack and can't complete the work,  nothing should blow up.  \n\nThese are very crazy preconditions, until you realize I'm not looking for employment, I'm looking for therapy.   Specifically:  \n\n* I don't care how must they pay me!    I don't want charity and I don't want to feel exploited, and beyond that,  I'm ultra-flexible.     \n* I really did used to be a genius type,  even still I can still pretty quickly learn almost any \"knowledge worker skill\" or software-related skill.   \n\nThe point, you see, is not so much to earn money, but to re-engage in society by taking a tiny tiny babystep to employment.  \n\nKeeping in mind I don't want gifts-- there are more worthy recipients than me for that.   I just want Information--   ideas to help me take a babystep towards greater independence. \n\nAdvice and brainstorms greatly welcomed :)     \n\nKeeping in mind I don't want gifts-- there are more worthy recipients than me for that.

            "selftext": "Don't worry, there's a tl;dr waaaaaay down there!\n\nIt all started in 3rd grade. It was free time in the classroom. Four of us were standing in a group when something funny \nhappened, whatever it was. I smiled and laughed. The group dissipated shortly. One of them stayed back with me and said \n\"Why are your teeth yellow?\" It hit me kind of hard, made me recede into my brain. \"Is this true? Maybe. Either way, I have \nto respond...\" I said that I just had yellow candy. I was eyed very suspiciously and was called a liar. I told her I didn't \nknow, and hung my head in embarrassment. That's when I stopped smiling. Third grade.\n\nI'm now 27 years old and embarking on a journey, away from the life I've let myself live.\n\nI want to start off by saying my dad is the best dad I could ever wish or hope for. I would literally die for him, no \nquestions asked. He has never been the type of man to say \"I love you,\" and when he does, his pitch goes up a little bit \nand he says it almost in the form of a question. I heard it a few times as a child, but it didn't need to be said. I mean, \nI totally wouldn't have minded hearing it a little bit more, but that's not the issue. That being said, he is also a man. \nAnd men tend to do things the \"man\" way, which is not the way a female would do it, especially when it comes to being a \nsingle father of two children. \n\nMy mom left us when I was 5. I didn't see her for a few years, maybe a couple times a year. Around the age of 9 or 10 I \nstarted seeing her every other weekend... most of the time. She had a lot going for her and I didn't really mind. I always \nlooked forward to going to stay with her because it was a whole different world than the way it was at home with dad. My \nsister is a sister from another mister. She is 8 years older than me and I always make fun of her age, because no matter \nwhat, I'll never be as old as her. My dad had adopted her when she was very young, 4 or 5 I think, but don't quote me. Her \nbiological father lived on the other side of the country and gave up his rights. I think that my mom made a very good \ndecision when she married my dad. He is a great man and would help anyone who was trying to help themselves. He is a very \ncharitable man, to say the least. My mom couldn't have picked a better person to leave her kids with. He has always been a \ngreat role model to my sister and me.\n\nBack to him being just a man. While growing up, I kind of just did what he did. He would put me in the tub and say \"Keep \nyour head above the water, I'll be back in 15 minutes.\" I really didn't know what to do. I would shampoo my hair and kind \nof play with the wash cloth. I didn't know how to clean my body properly. I didn't really learn that until I was 9. I had \ngone out and played in the rain with a friend, and I ended up covered head to toe in mud. To the tub I went. I took a bath, \nthe water was brown and what I could see was clean. Exit shower, dry off. Look in the mirror, everything was muddy except \nmy arms and legs. It was a good lesson. My grandma T was a good teacher when it came to personal hygiene. She would tell me \nto wash my face (don't forget to clean behind your ears), armpits, and feet. I never understood why, but I did it anyways. \nHeaven forbid I get into bed with dirty feet, she would have raged at me so bad. \n\ncontinued in comment below",

            "selftext": "I have had no real diagnosis, but I feel anxious every day and night. It comes in episodes. Sometimes I wake up in the middle of the night, thinking about something idiotic that I did 2 or three years ago. I get anxious when there are no real plans, or directions. Before meeting up with friends, sometimes, I get anxious to the point where I cancel and go home to sleep. I doubt its any kind of Social Phobia though, as I am a very extroverted guy, I like other people. But yet, I very often feel very, very anxious about the smaller situations, or things that happened several years ago. I fear it is getting worse as the years go on. Right now I feel extremely anxious about a good friend who is suppose to be coming to my house tomorrow, I know him, Yet I feel anxious to the point of nausea when I think about it..",

Sorry if that sounds stupid but the notion that this constant nagging that has been lowering my quality of life all these years can actually be labeled surprises me\n\n",
