Except the ones I found were all expensive or unappealing (to me). So I decided to make one myself.\n\nSo this is my app, What's Up?, the product of about 8 months work. It includes over 60 simple grounding techniques to help keep you grounded, thinking patterns and metaphors to help you keep your thoughts in check, and a diary and habit tracker. It also has a few different themes if you see the screenshots and aren't a fan of the colors. Any sort of feedback is appreciated, so feel free to let me know what you think and make suggestions :)\n\nLinks:  \nAndroid: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.jacksontempra.apps.whatsup  \n\niOS: https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/whats-up/id968251160?ls=1&amp;amp;mt=8  \n\n  \nEDIT: If you can't get the iOS version in your app store, try replacing the 'us' in the link with your countries code or whatever for example gb or au\n\nEDIT 2: I just wanted to say a massive thankyou to all the support you guys are giving me. It honestly means the world to me that you'll be able to make use of the app. As I said previously, as someone who has been through depression and still faces anxiety, it's incredible to be able to use the knowledge I've gained to help others get through tough times.\n Thank you all so much &lt;3\n\nEDIT 3: It's called What's Up? because I forgot to say the name of it and added the name in the post\n\nEDIT 4: Not sure if people are still viewing but if you are, I've read every single comment and released a massive update (2.0) which adds lots of things that were requested including being able to backup and sync data between devices :) Hope everyone is doing good :)",

Honestly, I can't imagine life without them.\n\nSo basically, the problem is that I have this habit of assuming worst case scenario.\n\nMom doesn't answer the phone? Well, she probably had a heart attack.\n\nDad's late? Must've been killed in car accident.\n\nTo make things worse, I don't live with them, so I call them almost every day to check if they're alive. Sometimes more than once a day. I know that this is insane, but I can't help it.\n\n\nDo you know what's the worst thing about it? They **will** die. Everyone dies. Every fucking day I wake up and ask myself: is today the day? Or maybe tomorrow? This uncertainty destroys my soul.\n\n\nAll this is source of many panic attacks and nightmares. No matter how hard I try not to think about it, fear always stays by my side and I have no idea how to make it disappear.\n\n\nEdit: Thanks for all your comments! I really appreciate it :)",

I didn't want to have sex whereas a minute ago I did. I just kind of froze and my boyfriend asked me what was wrong. I couldn't exactly vocalize what I felt or why I was feeling that way.

I was switching between mirtazapine and buspirone, to venlafaxine (buspirone did nothing for my anxiety, and mirtazapine was causing weight gain).\n\nWe thought the buspirone would be clear as it has a short half life, but it is fat soluble and can remain in your body for up to five days.\n\nA few hours after my first dose of venlafaxine, I became very sick. I was unable to move or speak. I had muscle tremors. I had a very high fever and heart rate. I hallucinated. I was very confused and mentally unstable. If I had been able to call out, or move, I would have called my husband to get an ambulance. I honestly thought I was dying and there was nothing I could do about it.\n\nAfter about six hours, I was able to start to move and speak a little and then was able to call for medical advice. \n\nI have had to stop all meds until Monday to allow my body to recover and rest. I am going back to the mirtazapine and I will work with my Dr on a suitable regime for weight control.\n\nSo, yeah, if you are changing meds, make sure you have all the information. Double check. And if possible, have someone watch you for the first dose for a few hours.\n\nX",

Up until now I've watched straight porn but it always has to be hardcore with at least one dude, and the dude is usually what I focus on. I can't get off to softcore naked women. Recently, I decided to watch gay porn to see what I thought. I really enjoyed it. I actually prefer it over straight porn. The thing is though, I can still find women attractive. If I'm at school and I see nice boobs or a sweet butt I can recognize that, and I actually notice attractiveness a bit more with women than with men. It's just that when it comes to porn and stuff, men totally trump women. And I was totally straight all throughout middle school. How the fuck did I just suddenly turn gay/bisexual? This has been on my mind for the past week and I can't seem to stop thinking about it. The thing that makes me anxious about this is not the outcome of being any sort of sexuality (because I'm totally cool with all of them), but of the confusion of it all. I've never been this unsure of such a big thing in my life. I've had an anxiety disorder for my entire life and this whole thing is really making it thrive. I'm actually afraid of spending the rest of my life with a man because the thought of spending the rest of my life with a woman is so ingrained in my psyche that just the thought of such a thing is totally foreign. But, I just went on a trip with a group of 8 people and there was one guy in our group that I was genuinely attracted to and that I would consider spending my life with. This is the first time that's ever happened. Maybe the answer is totally obvious to everyone else. If it is then please tell me because I have no idea.",

            "selftext": "I've been putting this off for a while because I got paranoid that by writing this, it would bring my anxiety back. But I feel in a good enough place now that I think I'll be alright.\n\nSo I've always been an anxious person, had horrible social anxiety and buried myself in video games and movies instead of going out and doing things. In short, I was just really scared of the unknown and how people would perceive me because up to that point everything I did was seen as weird or antisocial and I didn't get a lot of positive reinforcement from anyone that wasn't my family. That all changed in my third year of college when I found a friend/friends that accepted me and gradually got me out of my shell. \n\nThings went really well for a few years after college. I had friends, I went out and did stuff. I moved to the city and got a roommate (who i've known since high school/college) who is one of my best friends. When anxiety came a long I was really good at distracting myself and shoving it aside. I started going to the gym and getting in shape. That is key because one day at the gym things took a turn dramatically for the worse. \n\nI was squatting at the gym, had done it for months and months before this day. Then I unracked the bar for my third set or so and I felt and heard a crack in my neck. Immediately I went into a panic thinking I just broke my spine, what's going to happen to me?, I started feeling numb all over and went to the front desk and they called me an ambulance. After about 20 minutes I still had all of my motor functions so I believed myself to be OK because something would have happened by then. The ambulance picked me up, I went to the hospital and I just broke a small part of my C7 bone off. They said it's not bad and that I would be fine. \n\nPhysically, yes, I was fine. Mentally, not so much. That day when the bone broke off I had my first of many panic attacks and thus began my obsessive need to make sure I was not going to die anytime soon. When that happened I think it triggered something in my brain that we could die at any moment, anything could happen even if you've been doing it time and time again. \n\nSo from that point on EVERYTHING scared me. Spasms anywhere? You're going to have a seizure. Blood in your mouth (it was from sinuses)? You're about to die, get to the ER. Hungover from last night? You drank too much, you have alcohol posioning. Legs feels tingly? You're about to lose your leg function. Chest pain? Heart attack. Face tingly? Stroke. I got in the habit of obsessively checking my pulse, my blood pressure and any and all symptoms online. \n\nMy quality of life was rapidly decreasing, anywhere I went, there was danger. What was going to happen to me at work? What could go wrong when I'm in the car? I wanted someone with me at all times just in case something happened and even then, no matter who they were, I didn't trust them to get help if something happened.\n\nI eventually sought help, I went to many doctors to check that I'm ok. I got dizzy and lightheaded ALL THE TIME. I felt my balance was out of whack and felt like I was passing out every hour. I got 3 physicals done in 6-7 months because I didn't believe that nothing was wrong. I had a brain scan because I was sure I had a brain tumor that was causing my dizziness and facial tingling. Nothing ever showed up. I was recommended to an inner ear therapist because that could be the problem. I did that for 2 months and nothing improved. \n\nEventually I tried to accept the fact that I had incredible anxiety. The heart doctor I saw gave me xanax and my GP gave me celexa. I did CBT for 6 months with two therapists at the same office. It didn't seem to get me anywhere. The celexa made my anxiety 10x worse so I stopped taking it. The xanax helped, it made me relaxed but the underlying anxiety was always still going to be there, the xanax was just ibuprofen for the mind and incredibly addicting at that. I came to this subreddit and the chat room saying I was dying or panicking or that my mouth was dry and WHAT COULD THAT MEAN?! I woke up most days and immediately wondered to myself, \"am I better yet?\"  \n\nIt wasn't until the second therapist when she told me that I should try taking the xanax three times a day where I gave up on that. I was infuriated and insulted that she wanted me to take an addicting pill that if I ever went off could completely ruin my quality of life. There was just no way I was doing that. \n\nI went therapist free for a few months and still had bad anxiety, I tried to limit myself to xanax 1-2 times per week but that was proving difficult. Then something happened that shockingly helped me. And let me preface and say that I obviously didn't intend for this to happen and do not under any circumstance advocate trying this. \n\nI was being a good boyfriend and cleaning the apartment one day last August. I was just about finished and needed to put some storage in our second level storage room that you can only get to by walking on a 10 ft high catwalk. I was shimmying around and boxes, moved my leg back and missed the ground completely and fell backwards. I ended up breaking both of my heels. It sucked, I was on crutches for 2 and a half months. But in a very weird way, it sent a message to my brain that said \"Hey you dumbass, you just fell from a 10 ft catwalk and all you broke were your heels. The human body is resilient as fuck. Shit happens that you can't control, calm the fuck down.\" And gradually from that point, I got better. My brain accepted the fact that I can't control whats going to happen to me, no matter how much I plan for it. \n\nThat combined with the positive reinforcement messages from CBT that I kept telling myself gradually made me feel functional again. I very sparingly have panic attacks, I haven't taken a xanax since last August, I'm not as dizzy, I'm back in the gym and I go out every weekend in a city that can't be beat. I still do check my pulse and still do get very anxious but I'm re-learning to manage it. I know I'll never be 100% better, I'll never be the person I was before I cracked my neck. I know I just have to live with this because its a part of me, but I can't let it control me. My brain is finally listening when I tell it to shut the fuck up. \n\nI guess the point is that it's possible to get better you just have to keep working at it. \n\nAlso I smoke (vape) a lot of weed now. \n\ntl;dr Keep at it, you can do it. Also weed. ",

Once I approach an anxious situation and begin to feel the stomach upset, my anxiety increases ten fold and I go into full on panic mode. I feel as if I'm literally going to shit my pants if I don't get out of that situation. It's especially bad if I'm in an agoraphobic situation where I feel trapped and there's no way of getting out. \n\nAgoraphobic social situations are a part of life. When I get a job I'm going to need to stay there and do my work. When I go to college I'm going to need stay and do my work. I'm beginning to feel hopeless and feel like I will be like this the rest of my life.\n\nMy social anxiety may onset my physical symptoms, but the stomach upset gets me into panic attack mode. I've started a cycle of being anxious about getting anxious. I think \"if I go and hang out with friends, what happens if I start to feel anxious and feel like I'm going to shit myself? What I've I'm in their car when it happens? What would I be able to do?\" these what if's work me into a frenzy and make me anxious before I even approach the situation. Just typing this makes me anxious.\n\nI'm currently seeing a psychologist for therapy and a psychiatrist for meds, both of which think the best course of action is exposures, exposures, exposures. However, I can't do these exposures when I feel like I'm going to need to go the the bathroom every 20 seconds. I went to a gastrointrologist who said I have IBS. I'm taking Klonopin to help manage the anxiety, but I haven't noticed a significant effect and am still having to go to the bathroom on the fly when my anxiety comes around. I'm wondering what others who have experienced the same physical symptoms have done. What meds have helped for you? Have you turned to stomach meds instead to help your anxiety?\n\n",

That's what made me decide to try to post this here.\n\nI'm not quite sure how to put this.  The other night, I was rushed to the ER with horrible chest pains.  It turns out I have pleurisy, and it wasn't a heart attack.  I didn't think that it *was* a heart attack, but being in excruciating chest pain and not being able to breathe was pretty terrifying.  So, I get home several hours later, and I lie down.  Suddenly, out of nowhere, I start having a panic attack.  It had been a few months since I had had one that bad...\n\nI started thinking about death.  Not about *how* I'm going to die, but death itself.  The act of dying itself doesn't bother me, but it's the after part.  I know that we all die, and I've known eventually I will die for quite some time now (maybe since I was like 4 years old).  But I'd never really thought about death before.  All of a sudden, I started thinking about how one day I won't exist, I won't even KNOW I'm not existing anymore, and that life will be over.  I'll just cease to be.  I'll lose consciousness and I'll never wake up.  Life is all we know, so we have nothing to compare it to, and we can't imagine anything other than being alive.\n\n&gt; I feel like I'm the only rightfully panicked person in a room full of people that have drank the Kool-aid. People seem to just either ignore the fact that they are going to die eventually, or they find solace in religion.\n\n^^ That is from the post I linked above, and it's exactly how I feel.  It's been about 48 hours now, and I can't snap out of that mindset.  When I lie down, I get the panic, and I can't breathe and I just cry.  During the day, nothing seems to matter anymore.  Why am I finishing my degree when I'm just going to die?  Why should I clean my bathroom?  Why should I meet new people?  Why should I do anything?  On the other end of that, when I don't do anything, I worry that I'm just wasting my life, because (again) I'm going to die and I won't be able to do the things I wish I had.  \n\nI don't have patience for friends and family talking about the daily minutiae of life anymore.  I just want to grab everyone I know, slap them, and shake them, and just scream, \"Does it fucking matter? No!  We're all going to die!\"  I can't bring myself to give even the most remote of shits about anything.  Everything seems so pointless.\n\nI see that this is getting obsessive to the point where I need to see someone.  However, unlike my fear of heights, or my anxiety over my career path, this can't be fixed.  There's no way to stop myself from dying, and I think that that is why it's so fucking terrifying.  I'm not religious, but I have to say that now I really see the value in being a religious person.  I'd love to have the solace in an afterlife to comfort me, but I'm faced with crippling nothingness afterward.\n\nHow do I get to the point where I can exist normally again?  I feel like something has snapped, and I want to go back to that place of oblivion I was at before I became so hyperaware of my mortality.",
