Afterwards, I decided to go home, change, and head to my nearby Chili's for a solo dinner with just me, a baseball game on TV, and my favorite meal from there (margarita grilled chicken). \n\nWhile I sat at the bar top, a wonderful, kind-hearted woman named Sue, who was also eating alone, ended up chatting with me for the next 45 mins. or so. I learned a lot about her, and she found out quite a bit about my life too (even how my dad died). Before she left, she held both my hands and said a prayer for me. It meant everything to me on a night I felt like nothing, prior to our meeting.\n\nIt's moments like these that make me feel blessed. Thank you, Sue. You truly saved me.",

There are innumerable inspirational stories of people overcoming cancer, even the majority lose that battle. Mental health problems are battles, too, but they are often seen as lifelong battles (which they often are, of course), but that's, well, depressing. \n\nCancer is depressing; people re-brand it as something to be overcome. Mental health issues need the same treatment in order to increase awareness and move towards more positive public opinions. The benefits of the reduced stigma would be enormous.\n\nWe need this for mental health outcomes. Even in the field of mental health, everyone can seem melancholy as though you'll never really get better. There's rarely a \"now go! you're all better now!\" moment. We're always left with the fear of our own minds, and we need a way out of it. \n\n Mental health issues are seen as something to be feared, and this needs to change, because that fear is one of the primary detractors for people seeking help.

Wide open spaces in general have been a no-no, so I deliberately chose a route that would take me through the local park where there's a couple of fields.\n\nSecond was to force myself to cope without diazepam on me. I didn't take any with me so any panic and I was on my own. I think I did alright, I only started to feel funny when I got to the end of my street, and that was because I was getting hot and flustered.\n\nThe main reason I did this was to try and cause an adrenaline rush (I even had an energy drink to encourage this), much like a panic attack. And then calm down the natural way, rather than through pills. I think it worked somewhat. I'm just relaxing in my room with a cool glass of milk before I have a shower and get some lunch.",

            "selftext": "First I apologize for my non-perfect English, but I am sure you'll understand what I'm trying to say. \n\nIt took me 27 years to realize that I was taking life way more serious that I should have. I started recently recalling all the situations when I thought I was going to fail at something but didn't, or when I totally gave up on something because of fear and anxiety. I don't think I'm less intelligent than most people around me, in fact I think I'm just as average or maybe even possess some skills that other successful people don't. I am just lost in a horrible cycle of anxiety that has overcome my life and prevented me from attempting many **simple** situations and challenges.\n\n\nI would like to begin by describing that I graduated from one of the most challenging and prestigious engineering schools in my country. During my studies, I thought I would never make it and graduate but I did with the least amount of effort, not because I thought I was smart, but because I thought I wasn't! So I was afraid of studying, I was afraid of attempting assignments and group works. I only studied just before my final exams because I had to! It was a matter of survival. But I passed! \n\n\nBut you think my fear has stopped after graduation? No it didn't! I started thinking that I'm under-qualified and wouldn't find a job no matter what. I even didn't think about interning because I thought that I didn't possess the qualities and skills of an intern! So I never even looked for a job in my field out of fear and anxiety. So I did minimum wage jobs that I also sucked at because I was always anxious and thinking that I wasn't doing the job right. \n\n\nI initialized a break up with a really wonderful girl who was always trying to help and support me just because I thought she was too good for me. I also have an artistic talent that was kind of my sanctuary, I used to create works of art and publish them and I got offers from people to work with but gave up on them because I thought that I was still not good enough to be a professional artist. I even once refused an invitation without giving a logical reason, that the woman who invited me was confused! I did that only because I thought I would gonna screw up. There are many other little situations that anxiety has prevented me from even attempting!\n\n\nI have now reached nowhere in my life. I'm in my late twenties with no decent job or purpose. I stopped creating art and I stopped seeing people. It was all because of anxiety. The only difference is that now I started noticing those patterns and started realizing that this fear I have isn't logical and it's all due to the damn anxiety! I tried proving it to myself by thinking about returning to my original career path and I am reviewing what I had already studied and forgotten. I am still scared a little but I'm trying hard to get rid of this fear and reset my life to the point where I graduated a few years ago, and then go from there again!\n\n\nWhen I think about it, it feel as if I was frozen for many years due to my anxiety... On the other hand I like to think that me realizing that those things were not as hard as I thought they were, could be the beginning of treatment.",

After today I don't care what you call me, because I DROVE my car, and I had everything that could go wrong actually GO wrong, so I went back home and started over.  \n\nI drove to a second-hand store that was about two miles from my home, parked really far from the entrance, and I actually ENJOYED my time in the store!  I was in there for an hour!!!  It was crazy wild to be in a store alone, but awesome, too.  Really, really awesome!  \n\nBuilding up to it wasn't great.  I started the day by putting my dog in the car (I'm fighting a 15 year driving phobia, too) and heading to a closeby neighborhood to pick up something off of someone's porch that they gave to me.  My dog had her head sticking out of the window in the back and I'm not really familiar with this car because my husband just bought it, so I went to put my window up and instead put hers up - it scared her so bad that she shit all over the back seat then jumped in the front seat and continued pooping!  Oh God it was so gross!  I pulled over and tried to get it all out of the car while trying to keep her from jumping out, AND while trying to console her because she was upset.  I was getting so flustered and grossed out.  \n\nOkay, poop under control...time to go to a coffee shop because that was my goal - pick up the item and go for coffee.  There wasn't a single parking space anywhere and because I hadn't thought it through, I had arrived at the coffee shop at 12:15pm, not remembering that that's when people go for lunch.  Duh.  So I kept circling this tight parking lot trying to figure out where to park, pulled over along side of the road and texted my husband for support, got that, then finally went back and found a space to park.  I didn't want to, but I went in and got that damn coffee!\n\nThen the dog pooped in the car.  Again.\n\nI'd had enough so I drove home and took her into the house.\n\nAfter cleaning up the car I was like...no.  No - I am NOT giving up.  I'm out of the house FOR ONCE, my son is in school for the next few hours, and I don't care if it kills me I AM LEAVING THIS HOUSE!!!  \n\nAnd so I did.  I drove.  I parked.  I walked.  I shopped.  I bought two little things.  I drove back home.  \n\nI LIVED!!!",

My thoughts are slower, I can't fully articulate my thoughts even in my own head, and sometimes when thinking about a subject ill get the feeling that there is something more there, but i can't find it. I also have a hard time focusing on anything and my thoughts are very scattered all the time.\n\nI've heard that stress is really bad for your brain. is it possible that i have suffered brain damage from having so much stress? is there any way to undo this damage, or am i going to have to live with it?\n\ni was also an alcoholic my freshman year so that is probably a reason as well.",

I felt completely powerless as they followed me around, and so I went and sat down somewhere with the hope of being able to joke around with them for a bit until they eventually lost interest and I could escape.\n\nThis didn't work however, as they sat either side of me on the same bench and made me very uncomfortable - I didn't want to show  any weakness and reveal that they were getting to me, so I just toughed it out, made some jokes, and eventually said that I had to leave.\n\nThey got on their bikes and followed me all the way home - luckily my dad was out the front of our house, so they couldn't leave me with any passing remarks, but the whole occurrence has upset and disturbed me greatly.\n\nIt's not that I feared for my safety (I could take them in a fight, although I dislike the idea of them knowing where I live) I just felt so horribly trapped for the whole time.\n\nI'm writing this mostly to get my emotions out, although anyone who has been in a similar situation or has any advice for me is welcome to share their thoughts!",
