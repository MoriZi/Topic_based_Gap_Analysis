I knew he had no legal ground to do this on such short notice, he never even gave us a warning, had he come to our door 2 weeks earlier with a warning maybe I could sympathise but he decided to give zero warning, show up at our door without any paperwork and try this bull.\n\nWe have dealt with the tenancy board more times in the last 2 years than anybody should, because we cannot seem to land anything but the worst of slumlords.\n\nBut I knew my rights, and after collecting myself and stewing for a couple of hours I opened my always handy copy of the Residential Tenancies Act and a highlighter and started my homework, I highlighted sections of our lease, and the relevant sections of the Act and marched up to the jerkoffs door. I calmly but authorititively told him \"If you want us to get rid of any of our animals then we are going to be leaving anyway, however I did want to discuss some things with you, firstly here is our lease, it specifically states that under Section 10 of the Residential Ten....blahblahblahblah\"\n\n\nMoral of the story? We have till the 30th to get out and we are not paying a cent of rent for this month. Even that is technically bending the law but I'll take it. We win, he loses, and I am not fucking giving up a part of our family. \n\nIt is a shitty situation, but I feel amazing right now, I won. He lost. Boom\n",

My health has been gradually declining, both physically and psychologically, and I've been worried I've contracted something more serious than just anxiety making me sick.\n\nWell, when I went in to see him, I finally said, \"I think it's time to book some blood panels later on.\"\n\nTo which he replied, \"Oh, let's do it now!\"\n\nOf course, I could've freaked and jumped out the window, but the window is pretty solid glass and I didn't want to die :P So I waited and in came the phlebotomist to take care of me. She's a super cute (I'd totally date her) lady that was very, very comforting, let me rest back on the exam table and got me a pillow and everything. Finally, when she went to draw blood, she was incredibly gentle and quick. I didn't even have time to panic before she announced she was all done. She even hid the vial and syringe from me afterward (I was looking away during the procedure itself). \n\nSo, I did it! I was squirming and super uneasy after it was over and had to rest a while, mostly because it felt like my skin was crawling from it, but I made it all day without having a full-blown panic attack, and managed to get myself actually excited to hear back about what they may have found.",

I spend a lot of time thinking about how to end my life, especially while at work. it would be *so much* easier to just sleep and never wake up. \n\ni have a fairly good support system and could probably get assistance with money for living should i be out of the job. best case scenario would be to never return, switch back to a regular schedule, and find another less stressful job once i'm back on my feet, so to speak.\n\ndoes anybody have any suggestions about how to make this happen? could i get my psychologist or psychiatrist to say i medically cannot do this job any longer? how can i get out of this contract? i have no idea what the repercussions could be or anything. would this pretty much expunge the highlight of my resume and turn into another asterisk just like getting fired from my last job was, or could i just explain that i left due to medical reasons?\n\nok going to go put myself in a medically induced coma to try to sleep, just like every morning.",

Two days before the semester started, a woman approached me as I was leaving my apartment and she was telling me about her problems-she didn't have a place to live because her apartment roof collapsed, didn't know anyone who lived within walking distance of the school, didn't want to have to drive to school every day, trying to finish school, borrowing money, the list goes on. She needed a place to stay and somehow I ended up letting this stranger live in my apartment. I have a hard time saying no. So now I have two roommates in a 2 br apt. She wanted her own room so I sleep on the futon in the main room because I'm a pushover. She's not paying a third of the rent. She's paying 1/5 so me and my other RM split the difference. Same kind of deal for utilities. She tries get out of paying for living there by saying \"I didn't use any water here today, I didn't sleep here last night, I didn't use the internet today...\" like it should be deducted from her rent. I'm able to say no to that. She originally said she would be leaving early December, but recently she's been saying she might need longer. I hate to sound mean, but I need her to leave sooner. She is difficult to deal with, gets in my face sometimes, and I have no privacy anymore. My name is the only one on the lease. I do kind of care that she has things she needs, but I don't like this living situation at all. Neither does my other RM. I need to bring up when she is going to leave and tell her that it needs to be when she originally said she'd go. I want to be nice about it. She got emotional the other day and kept thanking me for letting her stay and calling me a miracle, which makes this somehow more stressful. The thought of approaching her about it makes me want to throw up. Thanks.\n\n**tl;dr**\nHow do I overcome my anxiety and ask my roommate to leave my apartment when she originally said she would?",

            "selftext": "I've had anxiety for 7 years now.   I decided recently that quitting stimulants was the right thing to do.  I was chewing about 20 mg of nicotine gum and drinking 4 cups of coffee daily.  I was also self-medicating with Modafinil so I could focus at work.   Week one, I quit Modafinil.  Week two, I started tapering caffeine and nicotine.   Week three, I stopped altogether.  This is week five.\n\n**Bad things**\n\nI got absolutely nothing done for two weeks after I quit Modafinil.   Zero motivation.  Anyone who takes this and thinks it is not addictive is delusional.\n\nMoodiness.  Until about a week ago, I was snapping at people and crying spontanously.\n\nPanic attacks.   Constant for two weeks.\n\nHeadaches.   Unbearable some days.   I still have a very small headache when I wake up in the morning.\n\nWeight gain.   I gained 15 pounds in one month.\n\n**Good things**\n\nSmooth ride.  I still have ups and downs but the magnitude of them seems to be getting smaller.\n\nSleep.  Last night I fell asleep naturally at 9 pm and stayed asleep all night, something I haven't done in months.  I wake up feeling rested.\n\nTolerance to stress.   I still feel panicky, but it's much less pronounced.\n\nMotivation feels like more of a choice.  Like I can choose to do a task or choose to procrastinate.   Before, it felt like the choice had already been made for me.\n\nOverall, I'm glad I did it.   I still have cravings every day so it takes a lot of willpower not to give in.   My mood seems to be getting a little better with every passing day and I'm slowly getting back my ability to concentrate at work.   I'm going to maintain for one more week and then focus on losing those 15 pounds.\n\n--Edited for formatting\n",
