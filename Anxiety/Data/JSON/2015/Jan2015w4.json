A few months ago, I was watching *\"Yes Man\"* with Jim Carrey and thought to myself, *\"Man, I could never do something like this, everything is so unplanned and everything must be so stressful !\"*\n\nI went to bed thinking about it and woke up the next morning, telling myself that I should probably at least try to be *that* guy.\n\nCollege having just started (September), there was obviously a lot of parties and events. I am the kind of guy that has quite a lot of friends, knows a lot of people and that is known to be happy in general.\n\nBut during my 5 years of high-school, I have been to exactly **zero** parties because it would cause me intense panic attacks. I would always find excuses to avoid it since people were wondering why I'd never show up.\n\nI realized that it's not a way to live for a 19 years old guy. So since College started, I forced myself to go to *every* parties and events. \n\nEvery times someone invited me to a party, an event, or just going to eat somewhere, I'd say *\"Yeah, absolutely\"*.\n\nAs expected panic attacks ensued, but hey, at least that was some sort of progress, right ?\n\nFast forward a few weeks, I was in a party, sitting outside with a few friends while most people were still inside. As I was sitting there, enjoying myself, talking with people I enjoy being with, I suddenly realized how far I had come since a year ago.\n\nAt this moment, I remembered a quote that I really like \n\n*\"Sometimes we focus so intently on our destination, that we forget just how far we've come.\"*\n \n--------------------------------------------\n\n\nSo here I was, in a party, on a friday night, instead of being home, happy and most importantly, without any signs of anxiety.\n\nThis, is the way we should all be experiencing life.",

I don't know if it's related (Some people in my family say it might be) but I began to get some of the olds anxiety attacks.\n\nYou know, the whole deal, something heavy on my chest, unable to figure out what it is, hard time breathing, dizziness, heart races, hands get clammy, throat tightens and I feel very weak, mainly my legs.\n\nSo I've decided to go to a Cardiologist and several other doctors (Gastroenterologist, Neurologist, Oncologist (I had cancer before)) to make sure things are in order.\n\nThe problem is that based on my previous experiences once you tell a doctor that you have anxiety issues they start to treat you like you don't even need to do medical exams. It's like \"Oh, you have anxiety issues? It must be that then!\". Seems like we automatically lost all our credibility the moment we say we have anxiety issues.\n\nSo now I'm thinking about don't tell the doctors that I suffer from Anxiety issues and Obsessive Disorder (Not OCD according to my Psychiatrist, weird). Do you guys think this is a reasonable thing do to or note? I would appreciate any advice. \n\nPS: Non native English speaker. Sorry about possible orthographic/grammatical mistakes.  ",

            "selftext": "I have struggled with anxiety\u2014mostly social\u2014for quite some time now.\n\n(Please nobody laugh at me; the subject I am going to talk about may sound like a joke, but this is actually a serious concern for me.)\n\nI just need to get this off my chest because it happened for the umpteenth time today and I want to know if other people have experienced this:\n\n**Okay, so...**\n\nWhen I go out in public, I will sometimes smile at strangers with whom I happen to make eye contact. It's just something that I do. I'd like to think it makes me more approachable and maybe even brightens someone's day...\n\nBut I guess not, since, seemingly every time I smile at someone, I am met with either a blank stare (at best) or a straight-up *scowl* (at worst). This genuinely bothers me. I find this is especially prevalent in \"packs\" or groups of people. So, a group of five, for example, usually means a mean-mugging x5.\n\nI find that my SA is especially triggered when I am out of my element or amongst people I perceive as \"superior\" to me for whatever reason (usually people who have more money than I). They're the ones who direct the majority of the mean scowls at me. I avoid elite-type environments like the plague and am much more comfortable in the company of riff-raff than pretentious people who like to flaunt their wealth around. I have also been treated rudely by obnoxious drunken people in or around bars (but I guess that's pretty normal).\n\nThe places I frequent are the park, the beach, the bank, the library, and the grocery store. I am a quiet, respectful, unassuming girl. And I am almost always alone. I don't have a vehicle so I walk and use public transpo.\n\nThe disapproving stares make me severely self-conscious and intimidated, causing me to instantly rack my brain for possible reasons as to why people are reacting to me in this manner:\n\n*Am I giving off nervous vibes?* I'll ask myself.\n\n*Oh god, I am, aren't I? They can sense the fear.*\n\nOr,\n\n*Is there something in my teeth? Is that why they're staring?*\n\nI'll even do the armpit self-sniff check, thinking,\n\n*Do I smell bad?*\n\nAfter process of elimination, I can usually rule out these options, which leads me to believe that people are either a) too busy worrying about themselves to even take notice of me; b) unhappy/having a bad day; or c) both.\n\nOr maybe there's another explanation that I'm not considering? Is standoffishness just human nature? Am I expecting too much from total strangers? Should I not take it personally? Is this just me stressing about something inconsequential (as I am wont to do)?\n\nI dunno...\n\nThere's a good chance this is all in my head. Maybe, I'm overanalyzing a non-issue and in actuality, nobody gives a fuck. But I'm sick of having people look at me with disdain every time I go out in public. I just want to know why I am experiencing this negative response? What have I done to deserve that kind of treatment? What have I done to anyone other than *exist*? Do people just have a false sense of confidence when they outnumber a single female who is walking alone? I gotta say, it really deters me from wanting to smile at people anymore; if it's going to yield such a nasty reaction, I'd rather just avert my eyes.\n\nWhich is essentially what I do now: Now, I avoid eye contact and just look at the ground or off in the distance.",

            "selftext": "I'm a 41 year old male, Recently been diagnosed with severe anxiety, and suffered from social anxiety for years. I come from London, England, I was born with spastic deplegia, a mild form of cerebral palsy. I have walked with a limp my whole life, and have the occasional involuntary head movements. I was bullied and picked on constantly growing up, and suffered from anxiety because of it, have always been scared around people, always paranoid they are judging me because of my disability. My mother was always pushing me to grow out of being scared, and wanting me to be independent, not relying on others.  I worked since I was 17, started at McDonald's and stayed there for ten years, it really helped me with my self confidence and anxiety. \n\nBeing around people I know was a comfort, any time I had to be alone or out to go somewhere, I would panic, and break out in sweats. I came to America in 1999, but never really told anyone of my anxiety and social anxiety. To those around me I've always appeared rude or distant, when in reality I just freeze and can't talk or explain how anxiety makes me feel.  Meeting women was near to impossible the conventional way, so I met women online, some I met in person. I met a woman from Michigan and we got married in 2001, but I never told her of my fears or phobias. When it was time to be around her family or she wanted me to go out with her and her friends, I always made excuses or just plain said I didn't want to go. All I had to tell her was what was going on, but I said nothing, so she assumed I was the asshole husband who didn't want to go anywhere with her.\n\nSomehow we had three kids together, but eventually we divorced.  My current relationship has lasted 6 years, I told her right from the start of my anxiety and social anxiety, and she had been great about it. Two years ago I had some neurological issues, relating to my birth disability. Went to see a doctor, and he recommended not working any longer, as on top of that I've got major arthritis in my hands and feet.  So I'm home by myself all the time, my gf's parents hate me because I'm not working and not worthy of their daughter, so I've shut myself away.  I eventually plucked up the courage to speak to my doctor about it all, he recommended seeing a psychologist. Been going to see her since July of last year, she has also diagnosed me as having depression and anxiety, and social anxiety. I relay all these things to my gf, and now I feel worse for it, she feels I use it all as an excuse not to do things with her or her family. My therapist feels the gf and the issues her family have with me contribute to my anxiety, as in their eyes I can't do anything right.\n\nMy sister is also a child psychologist, and she suggested finding like minded people for advice and even friendship, or for me to find a way out of 'my bubble' as she calls it. I guess my questions are how do you cope with your anxiety and other issues, how does it affect your daily life?. Would be great to converse with people that understand.\n\nThanks for reading.",

            "selftext": "Not too long ago, I noticed that when I am having an anxiety attack, my mind tends to believe that whatever thought goes through it, is either one more cause of anxiety, or something that will increase it. I'm not entirely sure how to explain this, so I'm going to give you guys an example:\n\nLet's say that I start getting anxious because I am soon going to move to a new apartment. My mind starts racing, my thoughts get fuzzy, I feel stressed and worried, my stomach starts feeling weird,  etc. The usual symptoms. If, during that anxiety period, I start thinking about how my dog is not listening to me when I tell him to sit, my mind will feed the anxiety attack with that event. I will now start getting worried about a new branch of issues: I have not trained my dog well, he may have hearing problems, he has not exercised enough, etc. And from that moment, every time I think about my dog, I get more anxious. My dog becomes a trigger.\n\nI realized that I do this often, and before I was aware of it, my anxiety would last much more time because the number of triggers would grow exponentially. But fortunately, I quickly learned how to control it:\n\n\n1. Isolate the real issue that is causing your current anxiety attack. If my first trigger was the idea of moving to a new apartment, then I find a more specific and deeper reason: oh, so I'm actually getting anxious because this is a 12 month decision, and I'm scared about such long commitment.\n\n2. Find a set of solutions to your problem, or reasons why you should not worry about this event: I made a list of pros and cons of living in my current apartment and living in the new one. I reminded myself how happy I felt when I saw the apartment and the neighborhood where it was located. I also reminded me how convenient it would be for me to get to work from now on. I reminded myself that it was not a life-long decision, just one year, I have enough money to break the lease any time and move somewhere else, etc.\n\n3. If, while I'm looking for a solution to the real problem, I start thinking about other things, and I start feeling they are turning into additional triggers, I shut my mind up for a moment: I just stop thinking; forcing my thoughts to stop passing so quickly. I breathe deeply and slowly, and I start thinking again, slowly, but from a more distanced perspective and a clearer and calmer mind. I learned this technique thanks to meditation.\n\nThese steps have helped me reduce the time my anxiety attacks last, as well as the intensity. I wanted to share, in case it helps someone.\n\nBe strong! Anxiety can be controlled if you make an effort!",

I was smoking weed (as I used to do every night) and watching TV. I went to take my dogs outside, and saw a huge spider run quickly across the floor. I jumped (as I always do, spiders are the DEVIL), and went to get something to kill it. As I returned to the living room, however, I felt a tightening in my chest, and my heart started to race. Bad. I felt panicky, Poop I was being chased by something. I tried to sit down, but felt Poop I HAD to keep moving. I paced the floor with my heart beating so fast &amp; loud I could HEAR it. I checked my pulse...180...my BP was 180/120 so I called an ambulance. The ER told me I had a panic attack. Never had any anxiety before this. EVER. At the time, I was on dextroamphetamine for ADHD and Chantix to quit smoking. Ever since then, I cannot smoke weed without having BAD anxiety/panic attacks, and I have underlying anxiety almost constantly, unless I am hyper focused on something. Fast forward a couple years, and I fell in love with the most perfect girl on the planet. We are engaged, and looking forward to our future together. The problem is that the anxiety is wreaking havoc on our sex life, because It gives me ED. Not all the time, but it's Poop if I worry about it, it happens. Even with ED meds. God bless her, she never makes a big deal of it.  I have tried almost every anxiety med, and they work for a week or 2, then stop. I suspect a placebo effect. fir the longest time, I suspected certain foods were causing it, and systematically cut them out of my diet, but that didn't help. I am now on nefazodone 50mg x2 a day, but it does nothing. I still feel the anxiety, and obsess about it. I have no idea what to do. I don't know whether to blame the dextroamphetamine and chantix (which I stopped right away), or whether it's all in my head (which I suspect). I'm 36/M, in otherwise good health. I want to fix this. It's ruining my life. I'm hoping someone out there can help me. ",
