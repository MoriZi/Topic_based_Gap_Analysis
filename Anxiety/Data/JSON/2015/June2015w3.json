            "selftext": "I'm a high school student. I've had problems with anxiety and depression for about the last six years. I have trouble with talking to people and initiating conversations. Especially over the phone. I get stressed out and start shaking and sweating and stuttering and rambling. There are times when I even get stressed out over calling my dad. Last year, my issues waned a bit, but recently I've had problems at home, and the anxiety and depression have come back.\n\nFor a while now, I've been planning on getting a piercing. I've probably put way more thought into it than I should have, I've researched everything from piercing methods to the cultural significance of piercings throughout history (I overthink things). I knew that the hardest part would be calling ahead and finding a piercer, but that once I found one and had an actual plan, I wouldn't let myself back out of it.\n\nI looked online; I found one. I had the number of the studio written down. I had a list of what I would say when I called. I picked up the phone and rehearsed what I would say a few times. I got a cup of coffee, lit incense, and turned on some upbeat music to help me calm down. It took me a while, and I was still shaking, but I eventually got the courage to make the phone call. Someone at the studio answered the phone, and I was able to ask my questions. It went well. I didn't stutter or ramble (at least, I *think* I didn't). I had my questions answered. I got down to the last one. \"I'm seventeen, will I need parental consent? What sort of ID will I and my parent need to bring?\" Before I could finish asking, the person on the phone cut me off, said you've got to be eighteen, and hung up. Turns out that the one thing I forgot to look up was the legal age in my state.\n\nNormally, I would have been angry at myself for getting stressed out over nothing. Not this time. I actually made a phone call! It seems like a ridiculous thing to be proud of, but I am. Less than a week ago, I almost passed out on an elevator because I was still stressed out over ordering coffee five minutes earlier. This time, I found ways to calm myself down. I did something that was difficult for me. It might have just been a simple phone call, and it may have ended up being a bit of a waste of time, but it feels big!\n\n**EDIT**\n\n*Thank you, All, for the congratulations! I really appreciate it!*",

An ex boyfriend taught be how to drive when I was 21 and then he broke up with me the day before my first test. That started a long spiral of massive anxiety surrounding the test.\n\nI passed on my 6th try but I've been to the dmv many more times than that. So many times I hyperventilated in the parking lot and couldn't even bring myself to go in the building.\n\nWhat worked for me? It's hard to say, it took a lot of time and a lot of failure. I always failed for stupid mistakes that I normally wouldn't have made if I was feeling relaxed and focused. This time I took it early in the morning. I was the very first appointment of the day. In the past I've had to wait in my car for over an hour just to get my turn to take it. The waiting is what killed me. Normally I work but I'm on a break so I was able to go as soon as they open and just pull up and go. I didn't have time to analyze or overthink, I got there and I was going.\n\nThroughout the test I took a lot of steadying breaths. I've been practicing mindfulness and anytime my mind started to wander I would take a deep breath and try to focus back on myself in the present moment.\n\nI also was taking it with the instructor who had already failed me twice. I had an internal monologue of \"Fuck this guy, who the fuck does he think he is?\" going the entire time and that honestly helped too, lol.\n\nAnyway i'm just driving to work and the store and stuff for now but I wanted to provide some words of encouragement for those of you in the same boat. I honestly never thought that I would pass it. I didn't think it was possible. If I can do it, you certainly can too!",

            "selftext": "So I have been working so hard to get on top of my anxiety. I lost my health insurance in March, it was important to figure out how I was going to deal with this. \n\nI had a routine in place for the panic attacks. Feel it coming, head to the bathroom, freak out in private, drink some water, put something cold against my face (for the inevitable puffiness) and resume my life. It'd been an ok plan so far. \n\nBut the other day changed the game and I don't know the rules anymore. \n\nI was at work and had a sudden sweeping wave of nausea. I'd never had that symptom in an attack before, so I thought maybe it was just the food they serve us at work. After about twenty minutes, my heart started hammering out of nowhere and this made me feel like I was having a hard time breathing. I'm asthmatic, it was my first thought. So I find my manager and ask him if the nurse is still in the building (I work at a huge company that keeps a nurse, I think it's neat). \n\nLong story short, nurse was gone for the day, the fire department was called, then an ambulance, and I found myself sitting in the dish pit in the kitchen of my work with an oxygen mask and threats of the ER if I can't get my heart rate down. They kept whispering \"anxiety\" so I knew it wasn't asthma, which both relieved me and freaked me the hell out. I've had plenty of anxiety attacks and they've never been anything like this. \n\nThe EMTs asked me what I was so anxious about. Ever want to throat punch someone for asking that? I know it's just his job and obviously I didn't punch him but I was hyperventilating so hard that I couldn't answer him. \n\nMy hands and face locked up and I was starting to see spots and still, \"what are you so anxious about?\" \n\nI finally managed to get out that I was having a good day and this hit me like a freight train. I'm not anxious the way I normally am. Sure, I hate my job and the new place I moved to, I hate that I'm alone in this city, and I'm freaking out because I'm in an ambulance and I don't have health insurance. \n\nThey told me my bpm was 170 and my blood pressure was too high to not take me to the hospital. \n\nFive hours and another episode later I was released with a bottle of Ativan and some anxiety paperwork. I didn't have a ride home but the nurse gave me two bucks for the bus. I was still riding high on the medication they gave me. \n\nI still don't understand what happened. \n\nI woke up feeling like I've been strangled. My heart doesn't feel like it's beating normally, just a little too fast for comfort. I'm jittery all the time now. I have this emergency bill looming over my head. I didn't want to go to the ER. \n\nI feel like im constantly on the precipice of round two. \n\nWhat is the opposite of nirvana? Have I achieved panic hell? \n\nI scheduled an appointment with my old GP to go over the ekg and whatnot but his nurse treated me with so much disdain that I was calling for an appointment about anxiety. I don't even want to go anymore because I'll have to see her. \n\nI hate everything. I don't even know why I'm writing this. I'm so confused.",

So poor, so alone, so lonely, so tired.\n\nToday I saw my ex-girlfriend has someone now.  I loved her, a sick part of me always will.  \n\nMy anxiety is paralyzing me, keeping me from moving forward.  I care so much about what other people think that the concept of pleasing everyone feels like a physical weight that's sitting on my chest.  Fearing that I'm not making them happy is making me freeze up.  The thought of disapproval stings me like a thousand needles.\n\nTo top it off, I'm sick - got nonallergic rhinitis, and if past years are any indication, it'll last another month or two or three before it vanishes again once the weather gets drier.  Sleep does nothing - I'm tired all the time.  My head hurts, my sinuses ache, I can barely think, I have trouble breathing.  All I want is sleep and sleep does nothing.\n\nI'm freelance, so my employment is irregular.  I'm too paralyzed to look for new work, so my funds are draining as the bills rise.\n\nI've worked so freaking hard in the past, come a long way, but still have basically nothing to show for it.\n\nThis past week I've been running and hiding, in video games, in Netflix, in junk food, anything to distract myself from the pressure weighing down on my chest, from my thumping heart, from the sense of dread.  Hiding from all the voices that call out to me, from the eyes that stare at me with disapproval.    \n\nI can't even meditate.  Being alone with my thoughts is...impossible.  The idea of sitting silent and still with nothing to distract me spikes my anxiety through the roof.\n\nI want to be free of what others think, but I don't know how.  I don't know how to free myself.  How can I free myself?  I WANT TO FREE MYSELF!!!\n\nOh God, HELP ME!!!  FREE ME!!!",

When trying to apply some agreed-upon exercise: it's as if I have various conscious levels operating simultenously (as a matter of fact, this is how my mind always works). Even if I could convince the lower level conscience to try something, I couldn't avoid the upper levels to ruin it all (convincingly showing me that this is only a little stupid trick, that one has to be too weak in self-knowledge to be able to fall to this one, etc.)\n\nThe arguments are very reasonable and persuasive, and I wonder how can therapeutic interventions like CBT be actually so effective on a rational, logical, hopelessly analytical mind. In particular, the claim that *every* depressed/anxious person have delusional minds, their disorders resulting from spurious thought processes/unreasonable assumptions, sounds offensive to me.\n\nI'm not even claiming that I have an above average intelligence. Just pointing out how my mind actually works and suspecting that I'm not alone here. I'm tired of being (implicitly) accused of being actively sabotaging the therapy, as if the CBT was made to fit all kinds of human minds, every failure having to do with the patient's \"unwillingness to comply to its standard.\"",
