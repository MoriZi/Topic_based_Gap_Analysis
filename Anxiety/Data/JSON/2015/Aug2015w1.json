            "selftext": "I started Viibryd last November, after being on Lexapro, Brintellix and then Pristiq. All of them helped in various ways but after switching to Viibryd it was like life in color again. I got out of my shitty manipulative 2 years relationship, I was no longer depressed and seeing the world in gray. My GAD is also really under control. And most of all I stopped having panic attacks. My biggest trigger used to be getting hit on in public or catcalled. Strangers scared me, especially males, after a sexual assault several years ago. I also would panic if I got yelled or spoken to by an authority figure, for example talking to a professor about a test grade would almost always send me hyperventilating in a bathroom. I used to be scared to leave my house to go to class because guys would whistle at me on my bike.  \nMy last panic attack was in January when I got spit on by a homeless guy. I think that was a pretty extreme situation that warranted a panic attack though, and even so it wasn't my worst. Since I stated Viibryd my \"activation energy\" for panic attacks has increased, meaning it takes me a much more severe situation for me to panic. But this last month I was able to go to Vegas, got catcalled all over the place, and none of it caused me to panic. A year ago I would have had a meltdown if a guy looked at me the wrong way. So it has officially been more than six months since my last panic attack. \nI'm no longer afraid to leave my house in case I have a meltdown. I know my case isn't that extreme, but hopefully this gives some of you hope that it gets better and you can conquer your anxiety!! ",

As I got older my anxiety just got worse and worse and by the time I was in 1st grade I went through a number of therapists and nothing scared me more than thinking I was a broken human being and that something was severely wrong with me So I lied to my therapist so I didn't have to see them anymore and I lied to my parents so they wouldn't be disappointed in having a worthless son (my mentality in 1st grade was pretty bleak but I remember that exaxt feeling clear as day.) I feel lying to everyone and trying to hide my real self from everyone brought more issues and since I tried to convince everyone around me I was a normal functioning human being, there was absolutely no leeway to act on my panic attacks and acknowledge my anxiety attacks which in itself lead to further panic and further anxiety, It was like an axietyception. By the time I was 18 I meet a girl that was pretty, smart, and most of all mean (or mentally abusive, which I didn't realize at the time) it was only logical that I should stay with her because I figured it's normal for people to act the way she did at the time so I couldn't break up with her out of anxiety and the wish to be a \"normal\" man.. Yes, man, I was 18 that's legally the age to vote, become fully responsible for yourself graduate grade school. So naturally I wanted to fit in... This is something I believe is wrong with society as well. You shouldn't pressure someone that young to feel like they're adults and responsible for yourself... Because when you take it to the point that I do it becomes completely devastating. I moved out of my parents house to a different town all together and not only that I had a child.. Not to mention I couldn't work a job to save my life. fresh out of high school that I didn't understand, fresh in a relationship that I never understood and being a fresh father... You get the picture.. And that's still just a fragment of my complicated mess of a life that I feel (or stress) could have been different If I would have just acknowledged the fact that I needed help and I wasn't meant to fit into normal society and but that just leads to anxiety of thing things I can't change, an anxietyception, but it's okay not to fit in. I guess what I'm saying is never feel like you're worthless, like I did, or you have to fit in with this society if you truly do not (like I tried and miserably failed.) because accepting yourself early will be a heck of a lot easier than accepting yourself down the road. \nThank you for reading and I hope I at least reach one person with this. \nWhew... Don't have so much anxiety regarding this text anymore.  ",

            "selftext": "So, it's about ten to midnight over here in the UK as I write this. Dark as hell, full moon in full force, that kinda' night. Nature's mellow, and I'm awake and anxious as always.\n\nThus - About 20 minutes ago, I figured that this was the perfect time to walk down the 10 steps or so and take out the garbage, because hey, no people around. Safezone, right?\n\nAt this point, I've already taken my sleeping meds, and I'm still a bit dazed from an anxiety attack earlier, so while I'm stumbling groggily down the very steep steps whilst admiring the moon, I think I'm at the bottom of the steps, and stick my leg out, but I'm not at the bottom - In fact, I'm a good 3 steps away.\n\nYet, I go to put my foot down and the cold embrace of gravity sends me crashing to the ground with an almighty thud... the bin bags went flying off into the bloody clouds, funny stuff to be honest. I even looked up at  the moon like it was the moon's fault and I was about to claim compensation from it.\n\nInstictively, I break the fall with my left arm/hand, and land super hard on my right knee, complete with gashes on all 4 fingers, a twisted wrist, early bruises, and an impairment in my left arm's movement, because I have a trapped nerve in both sides already which restricts the motion in them.\n\nBut here's the funny thing -\nAs my breath suddenly loses me and the \"Holy crap, I just flew down a steep set of steps\" thoughts enter my head, I immediately get back up, peel my aching body off the gravel, and tell myself, without any hesitation whatsoever -\n\n\"Tomorrow, man. We'll nail it tomorrow. Let the adrenaline do it's thing. Your breathing will normailze, Luke. DO NOT PANIC. You'll be fine... but damn it man, go clean the blood off, and bandage yourself already, I can already feel the soggy crap on your favourite shirt.... And feel a bit manly, you've earned it, mate.\" (I talk to myself a lot)\n\nSee, this is all 'very' weird to me because:\nI always worry to an 'obsessive degree' that my body is going to give out, that something's wrong with it, and something very bad is on the way, like some serious condition, or disease, or impairment, being a hypocondriac and all, and that's on top of everything else - But that fall has taught me something, something I'd like to pass on to you folks -\n\n'We are not made of glass. We can take a freakin' hit or two.'\nOur bodies can be as tough as our minds at times.\n\nHowever, I respect that some of us are disabled, and such a thing seems quite implausible: Like coming out of something like that with a positive attitude and some gashes here and there, but there's one other thing too -\n\nI'm disabled. I have been for years now. And it hurt like hell. But I dealt with it, because I'm 22 and I live alone. I had to.\n2 trapped nerves. Bad back. Bad knees (doubly so now, lol), wobbly legs, lightheadedness, chest pains, you name it, my doctor's told me I have it - But I'll live, and as long as I can still type, I'll be fine, being a budding writer and all. \n\nSure, it's sore and aching like a bitch, and my trapped nerve has been aggrovated big time, along with the pain still pulsating through my entire left side, resigning me to this chair here - But the movement's slowly returning, and my sense of humour remains intact, and dry.\n\nI'll sleep on it if I can, and see how it is when I wake up.\nI just didn't know I could still take a big fall like that.... might be down to the excessive milk consumption.\n\nPoint is - that was one hell of a fall, but I got the hell back up, and realised what my body was still capable of, so who's to say that you, reading this right now, can't take a few hits of your own, and that your body isn't determined to keep you going when you fall, in mind or body? Or both?\n\nWe're tougher than we perceive ourselves to be. Much tougher, and that much translates to our mind when we prove it to ourselves, but by all means, please don't go running headfirst into a fridge or something just to prove it. That hurts, trust me.\n\nIf this post helps just one person gain just that tiny little bit of confidence, then I'll be a happy chappy.\n\n\nTL;DR - You're stronger than you think.... and drink lots of milk, I guess.\n\nPeace and love, guys. Keep fighting.\nAnd remember, fall down your steps responsibly.",

To replace them, someone was moved from one department of the company to being my boss, even though she has no experience in my department. Since April, I have been absolutely miserable in my position. I feel that she completely disregards my experience and input, being a \"shut up and do what you're told exactly as you're told to do it\" boss, whereas before I played an instrumental role in the decisions made in my department.\n\nI've spoken with her directly about my grievances and is just defensive and hostile about it, blaming me for my worries. I've addressed HR on multiple occasions with no outcome or even scheduled followup to see if there has been a resolution. (Related: HR at my work isn't very dependable in general; there's video evidence someone is stealing food from the kitchen and has been for months yet HR doesn't want to see or hear about it).\n\nI'm at my wits end. I've tried looking for a job on and off with little success but I feel that if I had some time dedicated to searching, it may be more lucrative. I've had multiple panic attacks at the office, my depression is at a low, and I feel that I've made every effort to fix my problems but that effort isn't being reciprocated. \n\nA good vent has helped somewhat, but I am still shaking in my desk knowing that I have 5 more hours before I can go home. I want to hide in my car, rather than take a lunch break, just so I can get off of the office for even a moment.",

This might be my anxiety speaking, but I feel like thinking this way means ignoring something important my body is trying to tell me.\n\nIf I ignore my symptoms, I will always be worried that I could have a fatal disease without knowing for sure. If I play along with my health anxiety, I will end up spending all of my money and free time visiting doctors and going through medical tests. With my anxiety, I no longer know which symptoms I should see a doctor for and which ones I should just take a deep breath and relax for. So how do I find the middle ground? These thoughts are really interfering with the quality of my life.\n\n",

In the past year I've noticed these problems and I've been trying to figure out why this always happens to me. I've never even thought of anxiety, ADD/ADHD and depression just didn't seem to match with any of my problems. No matter what post I've read in here, there's someone who feels and goes through everything I experience. I've made an appointment today for tomorrow to talk to a psychologist.

I had never felt anything like it before so I panicked. I went to a super cheap urgent care because I couldn't afford anything else. As the doctor was checking me, he started asking if I go to church. I said no. I'm not religious at all. He told me that I should start going to church because Jesus will cure whatever I had. And that was the end of my visit.\n\n\n\nI'm going to a different urgent care in a bit for something  unrelated to my anxiety but I'm starting to have an anxiety attack just thinking about it. I did my research and all this time around. The center I'm going to this time around has an average of 4.8/5 stars on Yelp so I know I'm going to be fine. I talked to the receptionist this morning and she was *extremely* knowledgeable and helpful but my stupid anxiety is killing me. \n\n\n\nBefore anyone says anything, I know I should've reported the doctor but it didn't cross my mind at the time because I was shocked at what he told me.
