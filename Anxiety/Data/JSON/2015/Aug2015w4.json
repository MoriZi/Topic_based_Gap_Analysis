I won't link to any in particular because that would be brigading and just send out more bad vibes overall, but it's happening. There are comments floating around that read: \n\n&gt;Then why the hell don't you do something about it?\n\n&gt;You're a cry baby. Grow up\n\n&gt; it is likely that the people around you are trying to help you and that you are being abusive to them. I did the same thing. You do not need to control all the people around you. Learn to relax.\n\nAnd probably the worst I've come across in a while:\n\n&gt;These days people who truly suffer from debilitating anxiety are now lost in the sea of attention seekers. These are the same fucks who have taken the word trigger out of context and now use it for their own gain.\n\nIt's not cool. **Really** not cool.\n\nAlso to note, some of these are days old and I've reported them but they're still around - this isn't the kind of stuff that needs to be seen in a forum for support like this. There is no context in which any of those comments can be seen as helpful or supportive.\n\nMy rule I've followed: You give **everyone** the benefit of the god damn doubt. We don't know each other here but we all just want to be understood. I know it's the internet, but the whole \"if you've got nothing nice to say\" rule still applies if you ask me.\n\nIf you yourself have been the recipient of hateful shit like this, then I want you to know that you deserve better. Words can hurt - people don't always get it, but they can hurt through the internet too. Especially in a place like this where we come for just the tiniest sense of safety that we're desperate for in our actual everyday lives.\n\nIf anyone has ever told you to grow up, or that you're an attention-seeker, or tried to turn the blame around on YOU for your anxiety, then they're all wrong. I know me saying \"don't let it get to you\" doesn't mean a whole lot, but it should be known that there are still those of us that do understand.\n\nThis sub's done me some real good and it hurts to see this kind of vitriol thrown around. So just remember, a lot of us are fighting a similar fight, so kindness and understanding are the most important things to keep in mind - in our outside of this sub.\n\nI hope you all have a great day, take care of yourselves.",

Thinking about the past, fearing it will happen again in my future, catastrophizing, over generalizing, trying to guess what other people think of me, trying to guess the tones of texts and emails and assuming the worst, hating myself, giving myself a hard time for minor mistakes...\n\nI am tired!! I can't live like this anymore!I'm not living life, I'm just enduring it. \n\nSo I went to my new therapist, and he said to ask yourself questions so you stay present.  If we stay present we won't bring up the negativity of our past and associate it with our future. Also, it keeps us logical - using the information we currently have in our surrounding environment.\n\nEmotions stay out of it! \n\nHere are some of the ones I've been using:\n\nWhat is in front of you?\nWhat do you see?\nWhat do you hear?\n\n\nAnd answer yourself. \n\nAnd every time you venture back into the past or try to predict the future, or guess what someone is thinking, stop yourself and ask yourself these questions. Keep doing it every time you time travel.\n\nI'm really liking it.\n\nEvery bit helps.\n\nEdit: Glad this is helping people! A study showed that people with anxiety and depression have a difficult time with cognitive functions. Their perception of reality is distorted and it effects how they feel.  We have to stop letting our emotions control our thoughts. Stay logical!  I'm currently reading a great book called \"Feeling Good\" By David Burns.  It is transformative.  It will tell you about cognitive distortions (black or white thinking, overgeneralizing, labeling, fortune telling, mind reading...) and what to do about them. \n",

I constantly feel the need to achieve everything and do everything perfectly and any mistake makes me feel like a failure. I almost feel as if my SO, family, friends and pets all deserve someone better and will be happier with someone else.\n\n\nCan anyone else relate?\n\n\nBackground: 25F with OCD since childhood and GAD worsening with age.

I'd never been inside, I don't drink, but I needed vodka for cleaning the tank of my electronic cigarette. See, I love smoking, its my favorite anxiety security blanket, but I also hate smoking and want to quit so I am going to try to switch to an electronic cigarette. \n\nThe liquor store scared the crap out of me and my heart was pounding and my legs feel like jello and my head was swimming, but I got a little bottle of the cheapest vodka I could find and made it back out. \n\nNext, I went down the street and bought cigarettes. Ha! I I realize that I won't be able to make this transition all at once so I need to be prepared and I'm going to have to do this gradually. Sadly, one of my biggest anxieties is strange things and chemicals, and even though I know exactly what's in the nicotine juice mix, and even though there's 5000 more chemicals that I don't know in a cigarette, its still something different and I don't like different. \n\nDid I mention that I hit every single red light on the way to the liquor store and the quick stop? Not just pulling up to a red light, I'm talking they were all turning yellow as I got there so I had to sit through the full cycles. \n\nAfter leaving the quick stop I decided I would go to the vapor store for the first time and get some ejuice. Would you believe that in the half a mile it took to get there I had to stop, pinned in on all sides by traffic, while I waited for a train to pass. Not once, as it passed over both of the roads I needed to take, so I had to wait for the same train to pass twice. I was not amused. \n\nI still persevered and made it to the vape shop, where inside I had a 2nd full on shaking, dreamlike, crushing chest pain panic attack. But explained my panic attacks right of the bat and the employees were very kind. \n\nI made it back home with my vodka, my cigarettes, and a new bottle of nicotine juice that I currently can't even look at without feeling anxious (I'll tackle that another day).\n\nBut today, even though it really sucked, I left my house and I did some stuff.\n\nTldr: Left my house, drove to 3 places (2 of them I'd never been in), hit every red light and 2 trains, had awful panic attacks, lived through the whole uncomfortable ordeal.

            "selftext": "I have been struggling with anxiety for years now.  Like most of us do, I've had ups and downs...times where it's off the charts and times where it's somewhat under control.  For the last few weeks my anxiety seems heightened.  I'm more sensitive to triggers and seem to generally be carrying that heavy feeling with me each day.  I believe a lot of my anxiety is stemming from my grandmother passing 3 weeks ago; she was a massive part of my life since I was born.  Much like a second mom, but with all the benefits of being a grandmother.  On top of that, my dog got very sick this week and spent two days at the vet.  For a bit, it was a little dicey.  It turned out to be mushroom toxicity (she found some in the yard) and she's made a full recovery.  She's already back to her normal self.\n\nI've been on Facebook since its birth.  I love it.  I enjoy all aspects of social media.  I love the engagement, I love the ever-changing content.  Over the last few years, though, I've noticed a difference in these things.  Facebook is used by people, businesses, news stations as a way of generating popularity and engagement regardless of the content that's being shared.  Every time I log on, SOMETHING triggers my anxiety.  This may sound bad, but I don't want to hear about a mother and daughter duo from Wisconsin that is going through chemotherapy together.  I live in Massachusetts - 5 years ago this story would never have been in my life.  I don't want to hear about a dog that was brutally beaten and shot in Florida.  These things trigger my anxiety...and I don't need that.  It seems that news stations have stopped sharing ACTUAL news...instead they share sad, viral stories from across the world just to get people to click.  Facebook has become filled with so much negative content that is not relevant to my daily life.  For some, that's okay...they have the tools to be able to keep scrolling through their feed without letting it affect them.  For me, it's not okay.  Right now, I don't have the tools to be able to combat these triggers.  I'm working on it, but I'm not there yet.\n\nSo, this morning, I deactivated my Facebook account.  I have been having the weirdest urge to cry since I've done it.  I don't think it's a sad cry, though...it feels more like the urge to happy cry.  It's like a weight has been lifted off of my shoulders.  I plan to remain off of Facebook for a few weeks.  I want to see what it does to me and I will reevaluate after that.  Something tells me I won't miss it.  I will keep my Instagram account.  Instagram actually tends to cheer me up.  Beautiful pictures, funny pictures, inspiring pictures...without all the viral negativity.  A different kind of social media.\n\nI shared this with my mom and sister, who also suffer from anxiety.  My sister had already deactivated her account months ago and urged me to do the same.  My mom was contemplating deactivating her account for months and decided to take the plunge with me.  She's officially deactivated, too.  To anyone that has been contemplating the same, I invite you to jump onboard the bandwagon.  I don't need Facebook controlling my life and my emotions, I'd like to go back to doing that myself.",

            "selftext": "Background: I am 21F and have had moderate GAD and OCD since I was a small child. I have anxiety attacks a few times per year, and feel a fairly regular level of anxiety day to day. I feel like I manage it decently well, especially in the past couple of years. \n\nOk - Something that's been troubling me for a year now. My SO and I are planning to get married soon, but this is still a lingering problem I want to resolve the best I can before getting married. \n\nI feel like I have to maintain a constant balance of how much of my anxiety I let my boyfriend in on, and how much of it I bottle up so he doesn't have to deal with it. Does anyone else find themselves doing this? It's like when anxiety sets in, and my chest feels tight and the backs of my hands start to hurt (you know the feeling), I suddenly have to make a judgement call of \"is this worth telling him about? Or should I just pretend I'm okay and panic in the car by myself later?\" because I don't want to put too much on him, or bring him down. \n\nHe says I can always talk to him, and can always come to him. Which is awesome, he is really supportive. But I feel like constantly dumping my anxiety on him will just wear him down, and maybe make us both unhappy. But I also don't want to always deal with it alone, or feel like I'm hiding my feelings or bottling things all the time. \n\nThoughts? \n\nTL;DR - how much of my anxiety should I let my boyfriend deal with? Is there a point where it goes from healthy to unhealthy to be regularly open with him about my anxiety?",

But I've recently being with this amazing guy, he's wonderful and it's been a wonderful two months. Then overnight I've dreaded seeing him, and am actively discouraging him from coming round. It's not fair and he doesn't deserve this but I don't want to spend time with him. Which is mad because two weeks ago we couldn't get enough of each other. I've told him I have anxiety and it's getting quite bad but I think our relationship is the biggest trigger. I don't want to lose what we had, but it's hard to be with someone when it feels like I have one big brain screaming at my tiny little brain that I don't want this, just let be me alone, I cannot be in a relationship. The little brain is trying to shout back but the bigger brain is a loud and drowns out the other brain. I can't live like this, I don't want war raging in my head. It's exhausting and I've got a toddler and puppy to look after. I want to break it off with him so I can concentrate on getting better, but knowing I'm going to have to have the talk with him is setting me off. I just want my brain to stop arguing with itself. I think I need to break it off and hope he understands. How do I phrase it? \n\nThis happens every time I have a relationship with someone. 4-8 weeks in I freak out which is what's making me think it's some sort of romantic anxiety. I don't get in many relationships because of how I end up feeling after a while and I don't want to mess people about. ",

            "selftext": "I am constantly anxious about my online identity. By that I mean my email accounts, video game accounts, shopping accounts and even my bank accounts. I always feel the urge to \" start over \" and just make a new email and all new accounts to purge my history away. I really don't understand why I feel this way. Paranoia? What else? I am generally anxious and definitely suffer from severe social anxiety but I am not diagnosed or on any medication and doubt I can afford treatment or even the transportation to get there at the moment.\n\n\nToday I was thinking about my steam account and how I once made a payment with my parents credit card 7 years ago after giving them cash and somehow the account is soiled and I need to start over and only make purchases using my personal credit card attached to my name. I also would relegate that existing account to a secondary email address but would rarely or never access it again. \n\n\nAnother recent example is that I purchased a Wii U about a year ago and I spent two weeks agonizing over a good online username for my account. I ended up making 6 or 7 accounts and deleting each one because I didn't like it or I was feeling dysphoric about the mii character I created and my conflicted gender identity. Instead of coming up with a account name I just formatted the system and have not touched it in months despite wanting to play games.\n\n\nAnother situation is that I had a tumblr account where I posted random things and on there you can tag each post so it can be found later or identified. Like if you post a selfie you can tag the actual post with the word selfie. The thing that bothered me was that all these tags are automatically saved and pop up if you decide to use them later. That really bothered me and I deleted my account. Instead of making a new account I just haven't gone on that site even though I really want to.\n\n\nJust writing about this stuff is making me feel better but I know I need to work on it. Thanks for the replies everyone.\n",

            "selftext": "So, like many of you, I've grown very sick of having anxiety so I've been doing a ton of research on how to beat it. I came across a great book called The Anxiety and Phobia Workbook which has been my favorite book so far.\n\nBasically, he explains having anxiety/panic as reacting to stimuli with catastrophic thoughts. It seems kind of obvious when typed out, but I never thought of it like this. If I feel any sort of discomfort, I immediately magnify it and begin to freak out, where normal people feel this same discomfort and shrug it off. Reading this made me feel like it's okay to shrug it off, and maybe I will be okay. (Easier said than done, I'm still freaking out a good amount, but having that perspective helps).\n\nHe also explains \"first fear\" and \"second fear\" when dealing with panic attacks. First fear is when you experience the discomfort and your body reacts to it with anxiety, partly out of habit. There's not much you can do about this one, but that's okay, because second fear is the bad one. Second fear is when you look at first fear, and become fearful of it, blowing it out of proportion, saying things like \"Oh my god, this is horrifying, I'm going to die, I'm going to be sick, I can't get through this\" instead of \"Okay, I've gotten through this before, I will be calm in a few minutes when the adrenaline metabolizes, my symptoms are uncomfortable but they are temporary\". He calls statements like the second one \"coping statements\" and they're already helping me! \n\nYesterday, driving to class I began to have a panic attack and thought I would have to turn around and go back home. Then I realized I was letting second fear get to me by blowing everything out of proportion. I took a deep breath and told myself, \"it's just another panic attack, and if I focus on relaxing, or this song playing, the symptoms will disappear as this can be very temporary.\" Within five minutes, the queasiness went down, my breathing became less shallow, I stopped sweating, and I actually believed I could get through this. I ended up being able to go to class and sit through the whole 3 hour lecture, which is huge for me!\n\nI understand this technique may not work for everyone, and it may seem a little simplistic, but I highly urge everyone to read this book (It's by Edmund J. Bourne, I think you can get the ebook on amazon but if you google it I'm sure there are many options). Anyways, thanks for reading, good luck to everyone.",

I'll get into a routine, and when I have to change that routine it makes me feel really uncomfortable and anxious.  It's become a problem with jobs for me.  I had a job a few months ago that I kept for about a month and then quit because it was too anxiety-inducing, I think because they wouldn't give me a schedule for some reason? I just had to wait for them to call and tell me I was working the next day, which really threw me off.  I quit because of the unpredictability, which I honestly don't know how anyone can handle.  \n\nI just got hired at a new part-time job last Thursday.  I had training yesterday and have my second day of training today.  I've been having anxiety attack after anxiety attack, even though it's a fairly low-stress, food service job.  The entire day before I have a shift, at any job, I am completely unable to enjoy my day at all. The thought of having something to do later in the day completely overrides any positive feeling I might have.  Yesterday's training wasn't even bad, just a bit boring, which is to be expected.  I just don't want to spend all day today in a depression about my night I'm used to being interrupted. It makes me feel horrible because when I bring up my concerns with anyone they just say something like \"yeah that's life, work isn't supposed to be fun\" or something.  I know it's not supposed to be fun, but I don't think it should cause me so much distress even when I'm not there. \n\nIt's strange because it's not just work this happens with.  Any obligation I have, like a get-together with friends, my family coming to town, plans to go out to dinner with my boyfriend, etc. will have the same effect on me the entire day.  I feel paralyzed, unable to accomplish anything the whole day because I'm just anticipating what's going to happen later. I'm really sick of so much of my time being wasted because of this. ",
