My SO had finally convinced me to go talk to a health professional about my anxiety issues and I just canceled my appointment because I was feeling too anxious about it. I regret it and hate myself right now for doing that. I am an idiot and thought it would make the anxiety about the appointment go away but now it feels a lot worse. Has anyone been in the same situation? What made you go to the doctor to talk about your anxiety? Maybe I need encouragement. Thank you in advance.\n\nEdit: I just read all the comments and wow. Thank you everyone for your support, you have no idea how much it means to hear from others who understand the feels. I just re-booked an appointment for next Monday. \n\nEdit 2: Went to my appointment. Officially on my way to feeling like myself again. If I can do it, you guys can do it too. &lt;3 ",

That means that many people out there learned something, feel better after reading posts, or just want to check up on how the subreddit is doing and that...is a good thing.

It's kind of strange to see on every thread (outside of here usually) all of the anti medication rhetoric. Just smoke weed and that's it. Bro, just hit the gym, that's what I did! Big Pharma is lying!! \n\nI don't think anyone's denying that exercise helps our problems, but it's silly to say they're the only solution ever for every person. It's just frustrating to see people acting like you're stupid, gullible, or weak (online and in real life) if you choose to take medication for your mental disorder. Choosing to go on medication helped me through a very dark time in my life that I don't think could have been fixed by just hitting the gym. I don't think people who've been through similar things would agree with the anti-medication BS. It just makes everything harder for us when people have this attitude. ",

            "selftext": "I know that many of you have an internal battle going on. I just want to ask a simple question on the scene around you right now. \n\nWhat can you hear around you? Birds? People? Insects? Cars? Rain? Air conditioning? Neighbors? Pets? Yourself breathing? Distant sounds? What else?\nMaybe what can you smell? Can you feel a breeze on you? Can you feel the carpet under your feet? Is there anything you aren't paying attention to? \n\nSome of you are probably aware that this is a question of mindfulness / awareness. And sure, it is one of the main techniques for anxiety and panic management. Still, a lack of awareness is something that roughly everyone on this planet suffers from. Children live in the moment outside of themselves naturally. For some reason as we mature we internalize more, lose focus and have to bring our attention to the things around us that we take for granted.\n\nFor example, the light through the window that paints shadows on the floor. There's a lot we miss out on even when we think we are there. We no longer pay attention to even simple tasks such as opening a door handle, feeling the coolness of the handle and the sound it makes.. It's familiar and it raises the question, how much of our woken lives do we sleep through? This isn't really the question I had for you though. Just the earlier ones would be great and I hope you can take away something from this.\nBring yourself back to these kinds of questions regularly and you might find a certain place of serenity.\n--------------------------------------------\nMy scene right now? I'm listening to a youtube track that I will link below. I can hear the air conditioning unit on the wall. My 2 cats breating back and forth as they sleep. My own breathing. I'm tired and thirsty. My feet are crossed and my stomach itched probably because I'm self analyzing. I've just turned youtube off and the air con and there is a heat exchanger in the roof making a constant fan sound. There's maybe insects outside but it also sounds like a water taps hissing. There's a very distant plane sound kindof rolling off the sky and a single car engine. My bed is slightly too warm. Annnd then I internalized abit and lost track.\n\nFor Listening: [Hot Spring 8 Hours - Rain Forest. Birds, Stream, Steam](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QsQfJ-n90nI)",

            "selftext": "EDIT to say: Sorry it's so long, I didn't notice, but that is all there is to say on the topic.\n\nOk so I am not a particularly sporty person so I am not here telling you my story from some Olympic podium or something. Listen up because I feel so much better and this stuff does help.\n\nA little background that you might need:\nI am a regular person in my 20s who has been diagnosed with a severe anxiety disorder a couple of years back. I've had all the usual stuff: panic attacks, crazy hypochondria, days locked in my bedroom for paralyzing fear I'd be run over by a car, some degree of PTSD and a cluster C personality disorder. It was total crap, as we all know. I refused medications because a friend was taking it and I saw how dependent he became. I started with some natural supplements and things were a little better thanks to therapy but you know symptoms are always there hidden in your brain. Also, I am very sensitive to placebos as a person, because I've never been heavily drugged. This was just my before-experience.\n\nI've always moved around quite a lot throughout Europe for university and work and so I continued. I am currently still seeing a therapist who is helping me with becoming my better self. But if there is one thing that seems to be re-organizing my brain to the core is working out. Crazy, I know. Everybody says it over and over. And it's true and I will tell you why from a \"lazy person\" perspective.\n\n\nI KNOW the main problem with working out is that the very act of getting your heart rate higher may trigger some fears and symptoms that whoever suffers from panic attacks might experience. What I did: a total check up on my heart and stuff. I've had a good doctor telling me I am fine from that point of view.  I tried to remember his words as I started to run. I went running until I couldn't breathe and man did the world look like a better place.\n\nI tried a few things because as I said I am not a very sporty person. Workin out sucks while you are doing it, but it's the after-part you want to look for. So here is what I suggest you do:\n\n\n- Find the sport you like. There IS something you like. It might be some team discipline, kickin someone's ass in martial arts, running, or just exercising to get a more toned body. Anything that you like. The point here is feeling like YOU ARE IN CONTROL. Because you are, or you will be. Your body is your temple. REALLY\n\n\n- Start slow. When I started exercising everyday after/before work, it didn't go well because I didn't have time to do other things I liked. I grew annoyed and quit for a while. Find what works for you, especially if you are not a sporty person. You might feel scared the first times. It's ok, it's just your body working.\n\n\n- After the workout or whatever, stop for a second and listen to you body's response. It will be physically painful the next day, but that's part of the fun. If the little science I know is not completely disconnected, after a work out your brain releases endorphins (which make you feel happy! yay!) and you feel like a freaking god. You just took total control over your body, you have just done what you are supposed to do: move, work it, release the tension. No more getting all tied up because of a lack of movement and fear.\n\n- DON't GIVE UP. I am a very lazy person and always found excuses. Now I force myself to work out at least twice a week, and it's working miracles for me. Do it for yourself.\n\nIn a few weeks -- hell, in a few days you'll start feeling better. Your body will thank you, your brain will thank you, life will seem much better because you got oxygen all over your brain and body cleaning things up. Here is more details on why and what:\n\n- Our bodies respond quite well to any sort of mental input. When I had severe hypochondria, I spent my days in tension and my back ended up hurting like hell, which meant more hypochondria: I was scared I had some problem in my back. My problem was being scared of having some problem in my back. Stupid, right? My face and my stomach were bloated and I looked like shit. It was my body processing all my negativity. Now I have been doing some hardcore (hardcore for my ridiculous training level) workouts in the past weeks/month, I found myself with a resemblance of abs and an amazing feeling of using my body for what it is supposed to be used.\n\n- Your body will be PHYSICALLY PRONE to avoid shit like panic attacks and the like, because your tension will be sorted out with some movement. It's really a matter of not feeding the beast. Channel your energy.\n\n- Your problems will look smaller. Any problem, really. Don't get me wrong, I haven't deleted the past couple years. Your anxiety won't disappear overnight. But you'll learn to deal, to accept it, even to live with it and it will become something else. For me, at this very moment, it's a push to do better. To become the awesome person I couldn't develop into when I was locked in my room scared of any shadow.\n\nPlease don't roll your eyes when somebody tells you working out does help. You don't need to be the new Bolt to enjoy its benefits. I was among those who roll their eyes: things changed, and it's half an hour, twice a week. Don't forget your check up and then get moving. It will physically do you good, I promise. And it's a freaking lazy girl promising this.\n\n ",

I was asked if I would chaperon some high school students to Japan for a month this coming summer. I would be responsible for roughly 10 to 15 students with one other adult. My excitement level is only matched by the level of my Anxiety. I have taken 5 years of Japanese as well as done this same exact exchange route 5 years ago. I feel like I am well enough qualified but my anxiety is telling me no way are you going to do this. I feel like I am going to regret it forever if I don't go or ruin everything if I do. There will be no one in our group who speaks Japanese fluently though and I think that is where my fears are coming from. I'm so torn and angry and frustrated with myself for not being better.\n\nDo you think I am justified in feeling this way? \n\nShould I bow out before its too late? \n\nThanks so much for you guys this subreddit. When I speak to my family about this they tell me to just decide like its that simple. \nThat's why I am turning to you guys. :)\n\n(Sorry about format, this is my first post and it was a struggle, ha.)\n*edit for some clarification",

I was a total coffee snob, I searched high and low for my favorite blend of bean and had my whole process of hand grinding the beans and putting it in the french press and heating the water perfectly and letting it sit for the right amount of time, it was therapeutic. Now its fall and winter and I can't drink coffee and thats bullshit and don't you dare say \"Just drink decaf\" its not the same and you know it, I know it, the whole world knows it.

            "selftext": "I only have panic attacks very rarely. The last one I had was a couple of months ago at a big department clothes store when I started to feel too claustrophobic and anxious.\n\nWell, today I had one one at work. I work in a caf\u00e9, taking orders and making tea and coffee. It's usually quiet, and even the busier days that we had through the summer (thanks to tourists) were always manageable. But today, at exactly 1PM, large family after large family would enter the caf\u00e9 in what seemed like a continuous stream. It's half term in the UK and a load of last-minute holiday makers from England have come over for the week, I guess, (I live in Wales).\n\nI should mention that it's quite a small caf\u00e9, and there are only usually 2 people who work there at a time: one to take orders, make drinks and clear tables; and one to cook the food. Well, today 3 people were working: me and 2 others who cooked the food. Well, suffice it to say we got completely overwhelmed. The 2 cooks were able to cope with the pressure, but I just couldn't. In the middle of taking a customer's order, already with 6 different hot drinks orders to make, I had to say \"Please excuse me for a minute,\" and go to the kitchen. I couldn't breath at all, I couldn't stop shaking, I was sweating (ew) and I felt like I was going to implode. I wanted the the earth to open up and swallow me. I called my manager (one of the cooks) over and told him. He was actually very understanding despite us all being under a lot of pressure. He called his girlfriend (who works there anyway, but happened not to be today) and she came to help me out. \n\nEventually we got on top of the situation and I felt a little better, but still very anxious, shaken up and on-edge. I got to leave once things died down after the lunch time rush, and I was relieved to get home and hide under my bed covers. That was 2 hours ago, and after listening to music, reading and smoking, I feel better now. Not great, but better.\n\nAnyway, sorry for the long post, I just wanted to vent about my shitty day.",
