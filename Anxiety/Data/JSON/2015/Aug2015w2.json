Or I'll think about the time a guy called me ugly. Or the time I was turned down. Or when the teacher called me a retard in front of my class. Or the time I was caught on the toilet. Then I will lose all will to exercise and just crawl up into a corner.\n\nThis is happening more and more as I try to move on with my life from severe bullying. \n\nI'm listening to advice from psychologist to keep busy and to turn those negative thoughts brought on from these memories to positive ones but I feel I can't keep up with it. I will be in the process of processing my memory and then 5 others will pop up making me cringe and feel worthless. Then I become overwhelmed by it all.\n\nIt even happens when I'm outside making me very paranoid about being around people. I constantly feel ugly and I often interpret stranger's body actions towards me in the wrong way. For example, some guy will be looking at me and laughing... Probably because he thinks I'm ugly or fat or weird.\n\nI know those examples I gave previously may seem petty... \n\nPlease help. I can't do anything because of the waves of thoughts.

With doing intensive courses it meant I was having to teach myself a lot of work to catch up, to make things easier for myself I was studying two languages, one of which I knew nothing about.\n\nAnyway, with only having 3 subjects instead of the usual 4 (I had to drop one due to being so ill, physically and mentally) I had, and to be honest still have no idea what lies ahead for me next year because I only just passed all 3.\n\nDespite passing, I don't feel as happy or proud as I maybe should because I was so set at the start of the year to get A's and B's or at the worst C's. So for the first time in a long while I had that familiar feeling of dread as the panic attack took over. \n\nAny support or advice would be much appreciated!",

I ruminate on all the bad things I've done, and I hate myself for being so self defeating. What's wrong with me? Why do I have to be so weak and hypersensitive? Why can't I just get over it? That sort of thing.\n\nWell today, I tried something different. I said, \"I forgive myself for everything. All my mistakes, all my flaws, all my wasted afternoons, missing assignments, half assed essays, all the times I disappointed people, all the times I let myself down, insulted myself, hurt myself: its all forgiven.\" It's a huge weight off my shoulders. I've fucked up a lot in life, and that's ok. I forgive myself. Tomorrows a new day, and even if I fuck up again, its no big deal. I'll just forgive myself for that too.\n\nFor the first time in forever, I feel ok. I'm not dreading the future or ruminating about the past. I'm just enjoying this moment of peace. I hope others might also find refuge in this technique!",

            "selftext": "I finally got the courage to set up an appointment with a therapist to address my anxiety issues that have gradually been getting worse for the past months/year. \n\nI see the therapist in a few days but yesterday I feel like I hit a road block that has already digressed any potential progress I may have. \n\nI was at a family member's house last night and a fight broke out. It was a pretty intense yelling fight and it was about politics. It got extremely intense at one point and very, very mean things were said. My heart started to pound the very second it started. I eventually got pulled into it. When I'm at this house I get scared to talk. I'm scared to speak my mind. I'm terrified of confrontation. Usually, I just flat out dislike being over there because of how much it stresses me out. I constantly worry a fight like this will break out. After I was brought up in this fight that I wanted zero part of, she (family member) nags and confronts me to the point where I can't take another moment in that room. I ask to leave the room, and I'm told no. I stand up and say \"I just can't do this, I can't. I need to leave the room, please. I can't do this.\" but she keeps on and on and she keeps asking why I can't stand it, why I can't deal with it, and she is being extremely aggressive. She asks why I can't speak up like the rest of them, what's my problem? I end up snapping and yell back to her that I hate the fighting, I can't take it, and they aren't acting like adults. At this point my heart is racing out of my chest, I'm trembling, and my mind is racing. She keeps on but I honestly can't remember what is said and I finally start to leave the room and in my anger and panic I say, \"this is why I'm seeing a therapist.\" I completely leave the room and go into the garage and pace. I can't stop. My mind is completely blank and I can't stop moving. \n\nShe eventually comes into the garage and yells to me \"If you're going to be like this, leave my house and I don't want you back here. Leave. You aren't welcome. We are adults. I have a serious problem with you right now. You come in our house and don't talk and whisper to SO and it's incredibly rude. I feel uncomfortable in my own house with you here.\"\n\nAt this point I've lost it and I'm yelling back to her. Yelling things that I don't want to tell her, but she's nagging me and begging for confrontation. She brings up so many things she has issues with about me. Things like how I haven't introduce her to my friend, how I don't share anything, how I apparently stopped her from having a relationship with my mom because of my \"feelings\". I'm so upset, I'm so angry. I'm crying and trembling and I'm the most uncomfortable I've ever been in my entire life. I feel like the attacks and aggression just keep on coming. I eventually yell \"I HAVE SOCIAL ANXIETY LEAVE ME ALONE\". She doesn't leave me alone, but I think she eased up a fraction (but not like that made much of a difference at this point). I am then brought back inside and a to face the rest of the family (2 others) in my moment of utter brokenness and explain to them how I've been feeling. She eventually says she's glad I'm getting help and that she wants to help me as much as she can and that the family is there for me. She then calms down completely, says she loves me and that she'll try to alter the fighting behavior when I'm around and everything is back to normal like the fight never happened except for me crying at the kitchen table. \n\nAfter that, I don't want to see her for a long time. It's going to take me a long time to recover. I feel so embarrassed, ashamed, broken, and stupid. I didn't want to talk and I was not ready to talk about my problems with them. I feel like I was forced into this stressful situation and it's made me so upset with her. I feel that any help in the future from her will never be appreciated by me because of how she treated me. I will never forget last night and I will obsess and stress about it for months and months, years probably. How hard is it to be compassionate? I feel that any other person in that situation would not have acted in that way. Or maybe they would have and I'm just acting like a baby. I'm so hurt and confused.  \n\n\nEDIT: Thank you everyone who responded, all your words and advice mean a lot to me. I'm still shaken up about the whole ordeal, my mind has constantly been racing since Sunday night. I'm trying so hard not to feel embarrassed and ashamed but it's been really hard. I know it's irrational, but I still feel like everything that happened was all my fault. I don't think I've ever been more ready to spill my heart and soul to a therapist because I desperately need her help right now. ",

            "selftext": "I urgently need help with my anxiety but I don't know where to go, or what to do. I have suffered with this for 12 years. It's a battle every single day.\n\nI've been on all sorts of medications, I'm no stranger to my doctor. At 30 years old this is literally crippling me. Sometimes I would rather just not be alive because dealing with this is nasty.\n\nI've smoked cannabis for the past year, it was the only thing that worked after my meds stopped working. Previous to that I had Testicle Cancer. I became dependant on cannabis and smoke way too much. An unhealthy amount. I can spend \u00a3200+ a week on cannabis.\n\nBut it helped me. Now it doesn't.\n\nI stopped smoking it today, for good. I had a joint earlier, but I am determined that was my last one. I have no money for no more, and I want to ride out this storm and get my head back to normal.\n\nThe past few months I have been housebound much of the time. Content smoking weed, sitting on the bed with the laptop. But this too caused problems.\n\nI've lost weight. Non of my jeans fit me. I don't eat much when I smoke because I've had a fear of choking from birth. I feel sick a lot because anxiety causes me to suck my stomach in constantly.\n\nToday I left the house to go for a walk. I didn't feel too good before leaving. I could feel that cement feeling in the pit of my stomach and my mind was racing thinking \"What if I need food on my walk, I have no money to buy any\". Or \"What if I dont feel good and I'm too far from the home\".\n\nI done the walk, but under extreme anxiety. I had to go home towards the end, but my partner stayed with the dogs. It causes problems in my relationship because when I'm out I sometimes don't feel good and I need to \"escape\" the situation. The only place I feel \"safe\" is my home.\n\nWhen I'm out the house it's horrible for me to deal with. I will almost always have an elevated heart rate, then the tiredness will kick in and progresses into a full panic attack. If it's hot outside then it's even harder because heat makes everything feel so much worse. I read something about the UV rays from the sun triggering attacks, the same as florescent lights in a supermarket (which are problematic for me).\n\nI used to be able to hide attacks, but now they feel stronger and I can't cope with them when they happen. Except of course to go back to the house. 15 minutes after being in the house I'm normal again. Go figure :S\n\nI've had enough of this. 12 years! I'm on ESA because I can't work. I can't even build a career in my area of expertise because I find it so hard with anxiety to do anything.\n\nIt feels like there is no hope. I'm sick of feeling tiered, and sick all the time. There's only so much I can take before it starts effected everything else in life. It always ends in some horrible bout of depression.\n\nPlease, I'm seeking advice. What can I do here? I feel alone, I feel like nobody truly understands what it feels like to be that scared of leaving your own home.\n\nAnd I know it's going to be even harder these coming days because I've made a decision to stop smoking cannabis (and tobacco).\n\nI want to enjoy the last 20 years of my life (I expect to live to 50, anything more is a bonus). I want to see the world, with my family. I want to get a job to support my family, and be the man of the house. It's degrading to be put in this position.\n\nThanks for reading.",

I've had panic, hypochondriasis, social, general, childhood etc.\n\nAnyway I don't really get panic attacks anymore. Or the others really. But I do still have anxiety, it has just shifted into other areas of life. \n\nLike right now, I have a crippling fear of sex. I'm just sort of realizing it now, though looking back I can tell it has been a problem for a while. I've had multiple chances to lose my virginity but I just can't do it. Condom or not. Can't do it. Not that I don't want to, I am attracted to women. \n\nIt's not like an anxiety of body image or social situations. It's the act itself. The risk of infections.\n\nI can't even comprehend how someone can have sex, with or without a condom. The risk to me seems huge and not worth it. Even though I know that the risk of infection is low as fuck.\n\nI know for a fact I couldn't have sex with anyone. \n\nWhy am I posting this now? Well I got a bit drunk and fooled around with a girl a few days ago (we didn't have sex, we did nothing that could even be considered risky) and now I feel like my life has ended. Like it's completely over. Like I have 100% gotten all sorts of diseases from her. \n\nAnyway I figure this is probably even quite rare as far as anxiety goes, so I thought I'd post it here and see if anyone else has these problems or whatever.

            "selftext": "I have suffered from anxiety and depression since childhood, skin picker, past suicide thoughts (no attempts), life in and out of control, excessive alcohol use, withdrawing from society/friends, etc. As much as I hate to say this, fuck you shitty parents and shitty childhood. \n\nI started taking Lexapro in December after an alcohol related car wreck (hit a light pole at 3am, no one was involved except me.  Light pole is ok, but the poor car is totaled).  I was so out of control with my emotions and actions and I needed something to finally \"take the edge off\" of being me because over eating, escapism, alcohol and marijuana wasn't doing the trick.  Lexapro (generic, 10mg, then moved to 20mg 1x daily) made me feel warm and happy.  I didn't feel anxious, but I also didn't feel anything, including sexual pleasure.  In order to satisfy my sexual needs, my doctor gave me Wellbutrin (generic, 150mg 1x daily).  Boy, did it help!  I was hyper sexual and could have an orgasm again after a month or so of no feeling down there at all.  \n\nLife was goodish.  Nothing really changed, but I was medicated and happy.  I still continued drinking (says not to on bottle) while on medication and for me, it was a disaster.  For me, 2 -3 drinks within an hour or two was enough to make me blackout.  I would be mean to my SO and say horrible shit. I still continued irresponsible activity like drinking and driving, disappointing my loved ones, and generally not caring.  It was weird, because I didn't give a shit about anything, but the Wellbutrin made me even MORE anxious than before I started taking any meds.  I was a medicated and dangerous mess.  I knew it.  My SO knew it.  Work was starting to catch on as well. \n\nThe first few nights off meds, it was hard to sleep.  I was also uber emotional and would cry easily (a picture of urgent need pets in shelters made me weep like a child and contemplate the state of the world).  But man, am I happy to cry!  I also feel joy, and sadness, and apathy, but maybe that's just normal life. \n\nThe plus side to being on meds was that I could work through my inner turmoil more comfortably.  Even though I drank a lot and smoked too much pot, I tried to read something every day to be better.  I spent hours introspecting... I still do.  \n\nMy new approach to life has been summarized in a few montras which I repeat to myself multiple times a day.  Saying a believing these have stopped any anxious thoughts from overtaking my brain.\n\n\"Will this matter or be important to me on my deathbed? No? Get the fuck out.\"  \"My worries and fears are from past hurt and have no place in my life now.\"  \"The more love I give freely, the more full I am.\"  \"Empathize and be nice to everyone.  They hurt, too.\"\n\nThe last, and also the most helpful, technique I use to avoid feeling like my world is about to cave in at any moment is to just do.  Worried about emailing your boss about a problem?  Just do it now.  Don't want start working on taxes because it seems way too big, start small, and just fucking do them.  Asking for help and getting rid of my ego has helped tremendously.  I feel more in control of my emotions than ever.  I read somewhere that happiness comes from experiencing each emotion and feeling, but not letting them overtake you.  Also, getting into a solid routine has done wonders for my mental health.  I crave order and predictability. \n\nI feel like I just rambled.  I also realized I like using parenthesis a lot.  Thank you for reading and have a wonderful Monday! \n\nTL; DR:  thought I needed to be on some drug (legal or non) to get through life.  Stopped taking meds, learning how to cope with real life.  Currently happier than I can remember ever being. ",

            "selftext": "My general practitioner/primary care doctor has been treating my anxiety for about 8 years. She's a wonderful doctor and even though I recently moved 4 towns over I still see her. \n\nI've been on various dosages of Paxil and 2mg of Valium (as needed) for that whole time. Paxil helped me a lot, but I did have some unwanted side effects (low libido, anorgasmia, fogginess, etc.) \n\nThe doctor was very upfront with me and told me that I should see a psychiatrist and that her experience with treating mental disorders was limited (I imagine this is true for all doctors). However, at various points in college and grad school I did not have insurance to pay for a psychiatrist and it was too expensive out-of-pocket.\n\nThroughout those 8 years my anxiety would ebb and flow. She never bumped the Valium dosage, just the Paxil dosage. I never pressed the issue. I would set my own Valium restrictions, taking it only when absolutely necessary so that it would work when I needed it. (Benzodiazepine tolerance builds up fast). \n\nEdit: I think everyone will find that primary care doctors are overly careful with the benzodiazepines even though they are wonderful for anxiety when taken with care. \n\nSo last month I finally decided to see a psychiatrist and I've had a real breakthrough in my anxiety. She immediately switched me to Lexapro. I did a very hard taper off of the Paxil. Paxil/SSRI withdrawal can be absolute hell, but I was replacing it with another which made it easier. \n\nI started feeling better within a week. I started with 5mg of Lexapro and got bumped up to 10mg after 3 weeks. I no longer have the annoying Paxil effects. I seem to be tolerating the Lexapro so much better. I feel like myself. After 8 years and relative success, I never realized what Paxil was actually doing to me. \n\nMy point is, a GP is no replacement for a psychiatrist. I feel more confident in the care of an expert. I still love my doctor, but I realize that this is not her specialty. \n\nI know psychiatrists are expensive, and even though I have insurance, the new fiscal year meant I had to pay out-of-pocket until I reached my stupid deductible for the year. It's been worth it, though.\n",

How I am not still fired from my current job with all the mistakes I make because of panic attacks still baffles me.\n\nAgain sorry for this semi-coherent rant.",

But it's kind of hard to tell because I have a really bold and loud personality? \n\nFor years I did not know that I had anxiety because of how well I handled it. I would get crushing butterflies in my stomach (to the point where it would literally kind of hurt), I would have to go to the bathroom (I believe it's called IBS when it's caused by anxiety? Correct me if I'm wrong), sorry if that's a bit TMI. I've literally squealed out if I'm called or touched suddenly while in this state.\n\nBut then right after I'm back to giggling and carrying on a normal conversation. But on the inside, my heart is racing-- I literally want to be anywhere but there, my hands are fidgeting, if it's really bad I start to shake, I'm going thru a million things in my head trying to remember all that I have to say, I begin to sweat just.....The whole 9 yards. But to the average person-- They wouldn't know the difference.\n\nThen if it's really bad (like it usually is after interviews or a particularly bad day at college), the second I get home, I'm pissed off. I'm venting, sometimes crying. I just want to be left alone. It's an explosion of all of the tenseness being released.\n\nIt's almost a little insulting-- I've had people tell me that I'm overreacting and that I don't have anxiety, but it's like \"No. I know how I feel when I calm. This is not it.\".  \n\nAnybody else feel this way? ",

            "selftext": "This is my first official reddit post/question (which, hilariously, is giving me anxiety)... \n\nBackground: I'm female, 32, work at a computer all day but stay active 3-4 times a week. I'm also a high-strung person who cares a little too much about everything. I've been getting really strong heart palpitations since May, around the time my mom was diagnosed with congestive heart failure. I'm pretty sure the anxiety sprung up because I can't check in on my mom... My immediate family lives in FL while my husband and I are in LA. \n\nDoc says I'm fine - blood tests are normal, EKG showed nothing, heart sounded great - and thinks it's anxiety and stress. Heart thumps really hard and it feels like my whole chest is beating. I refused to take Lexipro because I don't want to depend on medication like that. Tried going the medical marijuana route as it generally calms me down a lot. Palps went away for 2-3 weeks but came back and have been around since.\n\nAny advice for people experiencing the same thing? I've seen recommendations for magnesium supplements and keto diet, which I might try next along with cutting back on coffee (I don't drink sodas). \n\nNote: I run a dodgeball league in LA. It's a fun way to stay fit and decompress but I also have to manage ~160 competitive people, which can be a nightmare.",
