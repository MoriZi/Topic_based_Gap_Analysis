I felt stress free, I could do any kind of exercise i wanted, I ate and drank what wanted, etc.\n\nSince a couple of months I've hit rock bottom again. I don't sleep wel, I undereat, I lost a great deal of the stamina and energy I built up last summer. And above all, I'm afraid of my own pulse.\n\nI can't stop checking it often. I did notice that when I get anxious or when I'm breathing weird again, when I check my pulse in my neck it feels like my veins contract very hard and my heart also, which makes me really anxious.\n\nIt's like my veins and heart are really squeezing together sometimes, and it really winds me up. It disables me from working out and getting into a better condition, although when I'm working out and breathing steadily it's not really contracting that hard but just going fast. An elevated heart rate also makes me anxious because I'm afraid it's going to stop at any given moment.\n\nI'm a total mess. It really prevents me from going full on during physical activities. Even drinking a beer can put me into a panic and give me palpitations and chest pain. I'm in my mid-twenties, I used to do loads of sports until 8 months ago, and doctors and cardiologists told me I'm fine, yet I continue to live this mentally destructive lifestyle.\n\nI just don't know what to do anymore. I tried counseling, but it's really, really hard to convince myself there is nothing wrong with me when I'm having this heavy contracting pulse, chest pain, arm pains etc.",

            "selftext": "So both my parents have pretty serious anxiety issues, though they refuse to get themselves diagnosed. My mom has what I believe is social anxiety, which she likes to take out on me by telling me it's inappropriate to talk about certain things with family friends (I don't have any friends of my own to talk to). This makes a bit of sense when you consider the fact that I have Asperger's Syndrome, and thus, have had some issues in the past with knowing what's appropriate and inappropriate to talk about, but I feel like she takes her worries about me to an extreme. \n\nMost recently, my mom got really angry with me about the fact that I dared to talk to one of my dad's friends about the book I was reading, which has to deal with true accounts of people overcoming mental illness. ([Here's the book](http://www.amazon.com/Same-Time-Next-Week-Stories/dp/1937163199), in case anyone is interested.) She thinks that it was inappropriate to talk to him about that book, since mental illness is something to be ashamed of, and hearing about the book made her uncomfortable. The thing is, though, that my dad's friend was genuinely interested in the book, and even took some pictures of it with his phone, so that he could look for a copy himself. And you know what? I **enjoyed** talking about that book with him. It was the first real conversation I'd had in weeks with someone who was genuinely interested in what I had to say. But my mom doesn't care about that, and she thinks that her own personal discomfort matters more than the fact that I was happy. \n\nMy mom has also gotten angry with me about talking to a family friend about the fact that I'm on SSI, since she feels like that's something that I should keep secret, so people don't judge me for it. She seems to be completely and utterly stuck in the mindset of \"we, as a family, should keep to ourselves and try to ensure that no one judges us for anything.\" I feel like that mindset just makes me want to isolate myself even more than I already do, and it also causes me to have horrible self-esteem, and that's so frustrating. She also has criticized my appearance before, saying that my pants are too baggy on me (which is odd, seeing as they all fit me really well), and saying that my hair is too messy. \n\nThe difficult thing is that my mom is very kind and loving to me in all other respects (and she's a very apologetic person whenever she does hurt my feelings), so it's not like she's being narcissistic or anything. So I often feel like there are two sides of her: the anxious, controlling side, and the kind, loving side. And I never know when the anxious side of her is going to be triggered.\n\nThen, there's my dad. He has what I'm pretty sure is OCD, though he, like my mom, refuses to get diagnosed. He tends to lecture me whenever I leave crumbs on the table after making lunch, or track dirt into the house. (And I tend to be a pretty neat person in general, so it's not like we're talking about huge piles of crumbs or muddy dirt tracks. We're talking about specks of crumbs and dirt.) He's also lectured me in the past about using too much water when I wash the dishes, which I find to be really hypocritical, since he tends to use a lot of water when he washes the cars. And he also is really big on conserving electricity, and has lectured me for leaving the lights on in a room when I'm not there, and for leaving my computer on when I'm not using it. I just feel like it's hard to do right by him, since he's so sensitive about so many different things.\n\nThen there's my own anxiety. I have social anxiety, general anxiety disorder, and hypochondria, all of which I have to manage pretty much on my own, since my parents are so mired in their own anxiety. And I'm expected to see a therapist and take meds, even though neither of my parents are willing to do either of those things themselves. I just feel really frustrated about how I'm expected to just deal with my parents' anxiety, and to manage my own anxiety as well.\n\nSo, anyone in the same sort of situation?\n\n[TL;DR: Mom has what I'm pretty sure is social anxiety, and Dad has what I'm pretty sure is OCD. I'm expected to tiptoe around their sensitivities and am left on my own to manage my own anxiety. I want to know if anyone else is in the same sort of situation.]",

I can approach anybody now and talk to them with ease, I feel more confident with my movements/walking and people actually come up to talk to me since they enjoy my company. I can't imagine going back to my old life. \n\nI used to have such bad social anxiety I would go into panic attacks and would have to do shit like crouch in my backyard if I heard one of my neighbors go outside and just stay low/not move/be quiet until I heard them go back in. Also I wouldn't be able to walk past a window if I thought somebody would see me. \n\nI would say that the biggest difference is now that I just don't give a fuck, I just go with the flow and focus on my own happiness and not what others think of me.",
