He told me that instead of trying to fight the anxiety every time it comes creeping up on me I should befriend it. I tried it and I have to say it's very strange but it's working quite well actually. I've found that instead of trying to fight against it or run from it, actually talking to it as if it's someone who's just there with me is kind of comforting. The idea behind the whole thing according to my wonderful therapist is that to truly begin to face anxiety head on is that you have to know that it is a part of you and you should stop trying to fight yourself. Be friends with every part of you even the parts that scare the shit out of you. Just thought I'd share something that could possibly help some of you righteous people!",

            "selftext": "I called my psychiatrist office on Monday to obtain an appointment for tomorrow, which I was given, no problem. I haven't been in six months due to being unemployed and not being able to afford it, my doc was aware of this the last time we met. I received a phone call this morning from the new front desk girl stating they would need to cancel my appointment for tomorrow because after six months I'm considered a new patient and new patient appointments don't start until April. Needless to say I flipped. I told her this was not a routine follow up or a new issue but more of a \"I need to get back on my meds because things are getting worse type of deal\" (I'm waking up in the middle night having panic attacks) She didn't seem to care and continued to deny me my appointment. I asked to speak to the office manager who according to her, was not there. Ok, I asked to speak to my doctor herself, the response was \"I'll leave her a message.\"\n\nI've had emergencies in the past where I've left this doctor messages and she has promptly responded within a few hours, this time there's been no return phone call. I just called again and the receptionist says \"oh shes gone for the day\" I say \"well I was advised I'd be receiving a call back\" to which she replied \"I gave her the message.\" End of conversation.\nI used to work in the medical field and if your patient called and said they needed to see the doc and it was an emergence type of visit and the front desk turned them away, you'd be in some trouble. That's a huge no-no. Plus, this particular doc has let me come in twice before with no scheduled appointment when I was having panic attacks and needed to see her (this was prior to the new girl).\n\nMy question is, would I be a complete crazy person if I showed up tomorrow and asked to speak to my doctor? I feel like I wouldn't but I need some advise. \n\nThanks guys! &lt;3\n\nEDIT: Ok, I'm off to my non-existing appointment! I'll follow up with you guys a bit later! \n\nEDIT #2: So it wasn't a very pleasant visit. I arrived at the office before anyone got there, it was just me and the receptionist. I calmly explained to her that I need to see the doctor and that I promise I'm not trying to make her miserable, I can clearly see she's super annoyed. She basically tells me to have a seat and then just ignores me, 15min later my doc walks in, tells me to follow her into her office. Once I'm in her office she tells me that it's irresponsible of me to just quit treatment for six months then demand an appointment. I explained to her everything that happened yesterday. She had no response to that but continued to tell me that she would see me today but that I would need to find a new doc, that she can no longer treat me because I lapsed in my care. Seriously? I asked her if she honestly thought I wanted that to happen because I didn't, I'm the one paying dearly for it now as my condition is a million times worse. All I got was a \"of course not, but..\" Anyway, she treated me, gave me meds to last three months and now I have to find a new doc. Hooray. It was a shitty experience and made me feel shittier than I already felt. Fucking ridiculous. ",

            "selftext": "*Independent. I hate my phone and stubby fingers.\n\nI'm xposting this from r/findapath, I probably shouldn't have bothered them. I am a 23 y/o female with severe depression and anxiety. I've been in and out of therapy since I was very young, but I haven't had much progress. Social situations, new people, crowds, and conversation scares me, sometimes to the point of self harm. \n\nMy dream is to be able to support myself without help from my parents, in some home of my own. I currently work in a quiet small business making about $400/month. Obviously no one can live off of that sort of money. I live in my moms house, and she pays for groceries, food, health insurance, pretty much everything I can't afford.  I dropped out of college due to anxiety, and have been at this job ever since.\n\nYou're first reaction is probably \"Well, you need to get healthy first.\" I agree. I do need to solve my mental health problems. But I'm also looking at this realistically. My family isn't going to be around forever, and without their financial support, I'd be lost. I may never be truly healthy, but I'll always need a roof over my head.\n\nSo where do I find a career? Where do I find a job that I could support myself from, but not end up losing it or hurting myself in the long run? For some back ground, I live in a rural part of PA. I would say most people in this town work in the factories in the area, and make less than $30,000/year. I can't work in a factory, guys. Not because I'm better than that, but because it's truly better than me. I'm not a lazy person, and I don't expect to coast through life. I'm very ill, and very self aware of my situation. Any advice is appreciated. If this isn't the place for this post, I really apologize. I'm looking for help to find a job to support myself, not asking for mental health guidance.",

I'm thinking of dropping out soon, but I feel awful because of the money wasted. The other day I had an anxiety attack thinking about it and almost started crying in the middle of a crowded mall...fun times. A 21 year old guy on the verge of crying in public.\n\nI really don't like school in general. For whatever reason, it drives me nuts, not to mention it's fucking expensive.  I want a job that requires minimal schooling.  I'm just not sure what, I do enjoy working outside and driving, so I'm considering doing work like that, but I'm just not sure. The added pressure from my parents to hurry up so I can move out, doesn't help either. So because of all this, I have been getting all kinds of feelings of depression and anxiety lately. I have almost zero friends and lately I've had no motivation to do anything. This should be the funnest part of my life and I just feel miserable as hell all the time. :/\n\nAnyways, enough rambling, I just wanna know who else can relate to this? I'm not really sure why I went to reddit with this but I feel like it might help in some way to have people hear me out...also thinking of going to therapy soon...thanks for reading guys.\n\n",

During my first panic attack it got so bad I thought I was stuck in time or on the brink of death. I notice it especially when I start to pace around my room.

What did I mean?\nWhat am I doing?\n\nand I honestly could not think straight enough to think of how I'd written it wrong. I was getting really flustered and panicky to the point where I felt super self conscious and embarrassed and basically almost had a panic attack.\n\nTo make matters worse; the LECTURER said \"calm down\", as did some of my classmates. Must have been at least 2 or 3 people in total saying \"jeez calm down\" out of like 7 students.\n\nThis means that to add to how horribly anxious I felt, they all NOTICED how visibly panicky I was, and also probably thought I was overreacting, in turn making me insanely more panicky and embarrassed.\n\nThing is, when you're practically on the verge of a panic attack probably the worst thing someone could say is \"calm down\".\n\nor so I thought.\n\na friend of mine, who knows I suffer from panic attacks, adding SO much more insult to injury, said\n\n\"jeez don't have a panic attack\".\n\nnope yep thats definitely the worst possible thing you could say.\n\nfuck.\n\nI was shaking for hours after.\n\nTL;DR: Lecturers should really read your medical profile to make sure they don't aggravate mental health issues before unhelpfully telling you to \"calm down\" when you start to panic.",

I feel like I'm drowning. I'm not saying this for pity or sympathy; it is my own fault.\n\nI hate who I am. I don't want to be me anymore. When I wake up in the morning, I feel this profound sense of sadness that I'm here, that I didn't somehow die in my sleep, that I have to do this shit again. Every day is like Groundhog Day.\n\nIt's a weird feeling. Total apathy. It's like I've already accepted that my life is over, if that makes sense? It's surreal. It's like I don't care anymore. I don't have the energy to care anymore. I feel like these are my last days. Like I'm in the twilight of my life. But that doesn't make sense. I am about to be 20 soon. Shouldn't these be the best years of my life? My life is supposedly only just beginning, and I already feel like it's over. Every day, I wake up and I say to myself, \"Well. We had a good run.\"\n\nI am tired of living. Of feeling. Of feeling pain. The pain of existence. Struggle. Suffering. Heartache. Misery. Loneliness. Sadness. Discomfort. Hunger. Crippling anxiety. Crushing depression that sucks all the lifeblood right out of you, leaving you limp and weak. Unpleasant things. Sorry if this sounds whiny. I'm just very tired. Tired of mourning and crying and stressing and thinking.\n\nI just want to sleep.",

I'm turning 25 this year. I've tried a lot of medications. I've seen therapists. I've altered my diet. I've tried yoga. Everything is a miracle cure apparently. I'm envious of you people who have found reprieve in something, but the truth for me is I don't think I'll ever get better from this. Honestly, I'm frustrated by the optimism, and by saying this I'm sure someone will think I haven't tried. Fuck you. I have tried. I try every day. I'm trying. \n\nI've asked for help since the beginning of this mess, I'm constantly looking for help. Lets cut the bullshit about how looking for help is a step to getting better, for some of us it's a fucking circle. An endless loop of medication, therapy, and anxiety that just sends back to where we were before, sometimes worse off. \n\nAnxiety is treatable. Sure, there are ways to make it *less* bad, but the truth is, there is no cure. That is reality. That is the truth. There's no cure. And somedays are worse than others, but there are days like today that remind me I'm stuck with this for life. I'm damaged fucking goods. How can I be with someone, if I can't even be with myself? How will anyone be able to accept me for me? \n\nI've got dreams, and hopes that I see pass by me as the years go by. I've loved and I've lost, and I'm tired of living this fucking life with a handicap. I know things could be much worse, I know, I know, *I know.* and by writing out this huge thing I just feel like I'm whining, but I'm just so frustrated.\n\nI just kind of needed to get this out, and for someone to read it. There is no hope for me I don't think. I'm not a suicide risk, so I hope you don't think that. The truth is, despite all my pain, I'm too scared of a death to be. No I'll sit here and wait till it's my turn to go, I just wish it wasn't so lonely. I just wish I could be the person I want to be. ",
