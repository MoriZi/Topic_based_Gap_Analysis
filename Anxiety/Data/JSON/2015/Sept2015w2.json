            "selftext": "Okay so yesterday when I went to a small express (takeaway) Espresso House (idk if you can find espr house in any other countries than sweden but it's basically just like starbucks except they don't write you name on the cup) I waited for my turn and the customers before me went outside when it was time for me to order. \n\nThere are bigger espr house caf\u00e9's but since I was more or less hurrying to my bus I figured I'd order a takeaway frapino and drink it on the bus. \n\nAnyway, since it was a really small caf\u00e9 really just made for takeaway orders if you don't want to sit outside the caf\u00e9, my barista was working all alone. I saw a pin on her working outfit saying \"new at work!\" so I figured I'd be a little calmer and let her take everything in so that she wouldn't have to stress my order since I was the only one in queue and she was all alone working there. \n\nWhen I placed my order the receipt machine stopped working and she attempted to fix it a few times, with no success. I started calmly asking questions like \"has this happened before?\" and \"do you have someone who you can call to fix it\" but by the look on her face I saw panic and stress crawling under her skin. \n\nI saw a few stressful customers run in to the caf\u00e9 and very impatiently left which left her even more stressful. \n\nBy now, I saw she was on the edge of being very very fragile and close to crying so I just calmly said, \"don't worry, I can wait. I know how it feels.\" and the look of releif on her face was priceless. We talked a little more and finally she was able to take my order and when I left we said goodbye and I said \"Take care, I hope it works out for you later\" \n\nWhen I left I felt so good, and I think she did too. I'm glad I opened my mouth and reached out to her because otherwise she might have started crying and that would have been even worse for her at work. \n\nAnd for anyone who might say \"if she's that sensitive maybe she shouldn't work at a stressful caf\u00e9\", no, even though someone works at a stressful job they do not deserve being left alone with an anxiety attack that might embarress them, and especially not at work in the middle of the city. Please, if you see anyone showing signs of a panic/anxiety attack, reach out to them!  \n\nLong post, but I thought I'd share\n",

            "selftext": "I thought I'd write something about what it's like to raise a child who suffers from anxiety.\n\nMy eldest was born in 1998.  She was a happy and rambunctious toddler.  She wasn't a particularly difficult child, and always had a huge smile on her face.  Oh sure, she could be a little stubborn sometimes, but nothing unusual for a toddler.  She was the apple of our eye and always lit up every room she was in.\n\nHer sister was born a couple of years later, and while the stresses of raising two little ones were tough, we managed to save enough to buy a house, and with some scrimping we managed to figure out how to make our little family run on a single income so mom could raise the girls herself.  Mom and girls joined groups for toddlers and all seemed normal.\n\nOur eldest started preschool, and while there were some occasional objections about \"how long\" preschool was, mostly she liked playing with the other kids, and always had a smile on her face while in class.  The teachers told us \"she's definitely ready for kindergarten\" when time came to decide.\n\nAlas, this couldn't have been more incorrect.  When kindergarten started, after a few weeks it became clear she did NOT like school.  \"Mom, dad, it's way too long.  I can't make it.  It's too hard.  Nobody likes me.\"  Eventually the protests turned into fits of crying in the mornings, and ultimately refusal to get in the car.  We learned that the best way to get her to go to class was to basically force-walk her to the school counselor's office, who would sit with her, talk, and draw.  Within 5 or 10 minutes she would calm down and go to class.  This continued for kindergarten and 1st grade.\n\nAt this point, we decided we needed to do something.  We didn't know what was wrong, but we couldn't continue with things as they were.  So, in desperation we open enrolled her at another school.  Initially things got a little better, but within six months, the same behaviors appeared again -- \"It's too hard.  I can't do it.  Nobody likes me.\"  This school didn't have a counselor, so we were in a tougher spot.\n\nWe thought \"Maybe it's the size of the schools.\"  They were both bursting at the seams, and the district had a history of bullying that was pretty well known.  So, at great expense, we decided to look into two things.  First, tutoring to get her back on track academically, and second, private school at a much smaller school.  \n\nThis approach seemed to work, at least for a little while.  She formed closer friendships at the new school, her academics improved, and we thought \"Finally we figured this out.\"  All was more-or-less normal until middle school.  Things went off the rails in middle school -- big time.\n\nThe first indication that we had an issue was academics.  They plummeted.  We noticed notebooks coming home loaded with doodles and pictures -- a lot of sad pictures with people crying or frowning.  I spent countless hours with her on homework -- it often felt like I was teaching her the subjects for the first time each night.  Due to her declining academics, the principal called us and suggested we have a school psychologist sit in her classes and observe (unbeknownst to any of the kids in the room).  After that assessment it became clear that things were definitely not okay.  The statistics the psychologist gathered showed that she was very withdrawn and did not participate with the other students or the teachers.  She suggested it might be a case of ADHD-Inattentive, and referred us to a psychiatrist who did some surveys and met with her, and concluded \"Yes, she does have ADHD-Inattentive, and a touch of anxiety.\"  She went on adderall, and overnight it was like a curtain had lifted -- within six months her academics improved, she started forming friendships again, and even started playing basketball.  There were still blips of anxiety, affecting things like her basketball performance, but we hoped that being more engaged with other kids these symptoms might dissipate.  Since the anxiety wasn't completely gone, we thought it might be wise for her to speak with a therapist every few weeks.\n\nFreshman year of high school was pretty good.  She had her first relationship with a boy, which started out quite normal, but ended in a mess that began a downward spiral that she's never fully recovered from.  It seems that the boy in question decided to leave the private school, quickly lost interested in our eldest, found a new girlfriend, and didn't bother to keep our daughter informed -- she found out from a third party.  This truly devastated her confidence.  Sophomore year her academics began to slide again.  At this point the psychiatrist suggested we treat the anxiety with meds, so sertraline was added -- eventually reaching the max dose (200mg).  The anxiety gradually kept getting worse.  Although we didn't get school refusals, we got withdrawal from friends and school again.  The anxiety started making her feel like she was unable to do things like take care of her own hair (mom had to help).  She started wearing the same clothes over and over out of a fear of trying anything new.  By junior year it was becoming very problematic again, and so we changed therapists, hoping that a new face might improve things.  By the end of junior year, she was failing two classes, and we had to work with the administration to figure out a way to help her pass by demonstrating effort on homework.\n\nAt the same time, she developed a crush on a boy.  We and the therapist tried to discourage this, as we felt like she really wasn't in any shape emotionally to deal with the drama that typically happens in high school relationships.  The boy is, by almost all accounts, a clone of myself, which probably isn't surprising.  Unfortunately he's also very well connected at the school (popular), and it's rather unlikely that he'll have any interest in pursuing a very quiet, withdrawn girl.  I think in some way my daughter knows this, and is attempting to moderate her behavior -- she joined cheerleading, joined drama, and joined the youth group that this boy attends.  All of those things are wonderful in the sense that they help draw her out, but she's doing them for the wrong reasons, and the setup for emotional collapse is quite evident from an adult's perspective.  That's where we're at today.\n\nHere's what I think many people don't understand.  We're not ashamed of our daughter.  She is still the apple of our eye.  I think people believe that somehow you can parent your way around having an anxious/depressed child.  If that's true, I sure don't know how you do it.  I feel like we've always tried everything that had a reasonable chance of success to help her overcome these waves of emotion that debilitate her ability to make and keep friends and to stay focused.  We've been tough, and we've been understanding.  We've kept our distance so she can be independent, but when she's run off the rails, we've helped get her back on track and tried something different moving forward.  I'm fully convinced that this is a mental illness that no amount of \"willpower\" alone will fix.  That's not something I believed before I had kids and saw this up close.\n\nThere are so many wonderful things about my daughter that nobody sees.  She's a gifted artist, but she often hides her work.  She almost always believes the best about everyone (except herself).  She has great hopes when she's not down in the dumps -- dreams of being an animator or fine artist.  I know that the happy smiling toddler who bounded from challenge to challenge is in there somewhere.  I'm not ashamed, I could never be ashamed.  I just wish I could remove this burden from her.  I wish she could see how truly amazing she is.  I wish she could see herself from my eyes and from her mother's eyes.  I wish she could stop imagining that people don't like her before she even talks to them.  I wish others would take a chance with her.  She's quiet and reserved, but there's a great kid under that withdrawn exterior.  Mostly I hope that this somehow resolves.  I don't want her to spend the rest of her life like she is today.  We love her too much for that.",

            "selftext": "**edit:** wow. I feel a lot better after writing this out. \n\nI started having anxiety and panic attacks when I was 13 or 14, I can't really remember my age at the time. Everything started from overthinking... life. \n\nIt bothers me that everyone I know, including myself, is going to die. I worry not only for my own health, but everyone else's health as well. I don't like seeing other people suffering - the simple fact that there are people out there suffering needlessly puts a pit in my stomach. \n\nIt seems as if whenever I'm tired or fatigued, I somehow think that I have some kind of debilitating illness. A small pain or a symptom can turn into a giant worry - \n\n\"Oh shit I have a pain in my wrist from playing too much guitar. Fuck. What if it's carpal tunnel.\"\n\n \"Fuck, I'm really tired this morning for no reason, what if it's leukaemia?\" \n\n\"Damn, my head hurts and I feel strange. Anxiety is making me choke on my own words. Am I having a stroke? Do I have a brain tumour?\" \n\nYou get the idea. \n\nHow do I break free of this? My biggest worries right now are:\n\n(holy fuck I feel so silly writing this)\n\n1) Secretly having a brain tumour or some kind of cancer\n\n2) Death. Existential stuff.\n\n3) Life. What is life? What am I even meant to do? What will I do? What about my parents, friends, and loved ones?\n\n4) What if I have a psychological illness? What if anxiety is a sign of that illness?\n\nI sometimes get panic attacks about these things. Admittedly, reading things up on google and WebMd hasn't helped in the slightest, but sometimes the urge to know overpowers me, and I just end up feeling more anxious. (An alternative to webmd which is nice is mayoclinic, which describes diseases in a much more friendly manner, and I don't get that worried when I use it for 'research.')\n\nSometimes, thinking about having a panic attack causes me more worry than having an actual panic attack would. Whenever I'm on public transport I think about what I would do if I had a panic attack - who would help me, what would people think?\n\nSometimes, I also get random intrusive thoughts, especially in periods of high anxiety. My mind just explodes with a thousand different thoughts in these situations and it really freaks me out. \n\nThis is what my anxiety is about in a nutshell.\n\nMy grandmother is also terminally ill. Seeing my parents upset causes me more pain than watching my grandmother die. This is also a source of anxiety for me. I know my parents, and everyone else is going to die. \n\nI'm very open to my parents about my feelings, and they've supported me very well. They have also taken me to a therapist in the past, and that did help. I was relatively anxiety free for the past year, but I've had periods in which worrying kept me up till late at night, and I've also had some panic attacks. \n\nI've started seeing my school's counselor, who is wonderful, and I felt a lot better after that meeting. Among other things, she recommended that I read \"Man's Search for Meaning\" by Victor Frankl. I'm going to go to a bookstore this week and buy that book.\n\nThis is turning into incoherent babble, and so I'll stop now. \n\nThanks for reading this far. \n",

            "selftext": "Preface: This was created for another redditor after reading her post to /r/anxiety and realizing that sometimes we could do with some tips &amp; tricks to try out.\nThe following is my personal mantra that I use to make it through each day.  \n\nI often find that I have an initial trigger of anxiety (eg unpaid bill) and then my anxiety increases when I feel anxious about my feeling anxious! (If that makes sense!)\n\nI struggled for several years trying to keep it all inside, and had a mental breakdown. It took several months, but I followed a couple of steps incrementally to reduce the amount of daily anxiety I feel.       \n\n1. 1) Take whatever medication you have to. Tell myself that taking medication for mental health is the same as taking anti-biotics for a bad flu, sometimes the human body needs a little help.  \n\n2. 2) Try to do some form of exercise every day, the minimum being a 30 min walk first thing in the morning. Accomplishing something I feel important at the start of my day really helps boost my day!  \n\n3. 3) As much as humanly possible, eat homemade and sleep 6-7 hours minimum per day. Everything I eat has a noticeable impact on my mood, with junk food being the fastest way to lead to bad feelings and upset stomach. /r/slowcooking has honestly changed my life, so many easy great meals. I need all the help I can get to perform at my best.\n\n\n4. 4) Accept that progress is incremental, and try to focus day by day. Yes, planning long term is great, but (for me) it leads to overthinking constantly. Focus on the daily habits and skills I want to develop, every day. If its important to me, its a daily habit!\n\n5. 5) I cannot control everything. Sometimes, things don't work out the way we want them to. I try to look at what I did, what I could have done, make a note of any changes I want to make and MOVE ON!! I personally struggle with this, but nobody can be be perfect all of the time. Sitting in my room stewing about the mistakes I have made will not help anyone, least of all myself.\n\n6. 6) Take a big slow breath in from your nose, try to expand your tummy. Slowing exhale from your mouth. Slowly &amp; deliberately repeat. Just focus on the breaths. I mildly hyperventilate when becoming anxious, and this really helps calm me down. \n\n7. 7) Talk to someone. Parents, good friends, SO, doctor, psychiatrist, cat, dog, anyone who you feel you can talk with. At my worst I would take a walk in the evening after work and quietly talk to myself about what I was feeling and just verbalize the panic/fear/anger. Long term I would suggest talking to a mental health professional, who can give you the tools to help shore up the hole we all dig. And be persistent! It took me 3-4 different psychiatrists before I found someone who I really connected with, and able to call me up on my bullshit and help keep me on track/ recover and keep going. Thats over the course of a year! And it honestly made so much difference to my ability to help myself.\n\nThats my little set of rules I try to keep to. I struggle and forget and ignore them, but each time I have felt less anxious, its due to these rules. \n\nAlso, the majority of these rules are personalized versions of rules found in this [book](http://www.amazon.com/Anxiety-Phobia-Workbook-Edmund-Bourne/dp/1626252157/ref=dp_ob_title_bk). Its my bible, and I think after posting this I will go re-read a few pages.\n\nAlso the [/r/Anxiety/wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/wiki/faq) has tons of great links to resources!\n\nIf you have any little rules of your own, please share below and help each other out!\n\nHope this helps. \n\nWierd Internet Love,\nFrom ARandomKiwiGuy",

However, I don't feel that way.  My wife an I are looking to buy a house, and I'm petrified of the financial commitment.  I make around $50K per year, and my wife makes around half that, and she has student loan debt of almost $50K.  I just look at all of these financial hurdles in life, and I feel totally overwhelmed.  We're saving a bit where we are now, but I'm almost too scared to do a detailed budget.  My wife and I talked about cutting back on some superfluous things (i.e. how much we go out to eat, etc).  We have $70K in savings, which I know is pretty decent, but I'm still scared all the time.\n\nI think it comes down to low self-esteem, but I'm not sure.  I feel inadequate at my job, even though no one else says so or even seems to think so.  I'm always trying to be the best husband possible to my wife.  I've never thought of myself as someone with confidence problems.  In school, I was always outgoing and well-liked.  These feelings of doubt have only implanted themselves in my adulthood.  I feel like I should be better, I feel like I should be farther along.  I'm terrified of failing at anything.\n\nI guess the moral of the story is, everyone talks about how well I'm doing and that I'm going to be and am capable of being very successful.  I just don't believe them.\n\nDoes anyone else ever feel this way?",

I want to help but when I ask he's like \"I don't know if anything helps.\" And \"it feels all so hard\" \nThis is over the conversation that our friends would like to see us, ( they know and make accommodations for his anxiety). Not even the event itself, the conversation! And it seems there are more and more things that get added to the list that trigger these spikes.\n\nI'm trying to get help for him (dr and therapist) but I need some help too.\nAny suggestions?\n",

            "selftext": "I will get my impacted wisdom teeth removed surgically tomorrow. Unfortunately, in Austria it is very uncommon for oral surgeons to offer sedation (neither N2O nor any other drug, just local anesthesia), the only option for people with anxiety that is offered is general anaesthesia, which is not covered by insurance and is extremely expensive.\n\nI am scared shitless and I could ask my doc for Lorazepam to calm down a bit tomorrow. But I'm worried that it won't be sufficient to prevent myself from being completely alert and having to hear all these awful noises, including the cracking, bleeding, pulling and the bone saw...Jesus Christ, I'm gonna shit my pants tomorrow.\n\nNOTE: My surgeon said that the intake of benzodiazepines is not a problem for the surgery, so it's my choice to take them or not.\n\nEDIT: *You guys helped me so much with my fear. It really feels so good to get so much support and so many kind words. You people are great. Going to sleep now, my surgery is in 10 hours. Got some Lorazepam and I'll go for it.*\n\n\nEDIT2: Back from my first surgery (next week the next 2 teeth will be removed). It was ok, the noises are indeed awful, the only painful thing are the sinjections. Other than that, it went really fast and the nurse was holding and stroking my hand (me beind a 23 year old big baby haha. \nYou might don' want to hear this but half an hour later I was aleady on my way home when blood suddely started gushing out of muy mouth after trying to put a new tamponade in. Had to go back to get new stitches, lost half a litre of blood. Next stime I will stay there at least for two hours before going home\n\nAnyway, you gzys helpmed a lot! Probably wouldn't have gone there in frst place without your support. Thanks!",
