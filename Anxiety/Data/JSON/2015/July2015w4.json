See, I'm 32, quite socially awkward, not terrible looking and never had a date or a meaningful relationship... oh yeah, and crippling anxiety attacks. \nI've met a good many women during my life but I never felt like I could connect or felt.. anything really other then \"Girl! O_o\"\n\n\nThis changed recently :o\n\n\nSo I've had a bit (quite a bit) of a crush on a co-worker, I work as a contractor for the company she works at for a few days a week so I don't see a lot of her. We've been mailing for some time when I finally got the balls to ask her out on a date. \n\n\nWhen I say, got the balls, what I really mean is spending nights without sleeping, nearly going back into full blown panic attacks to the point where I'd rather have her say \"Yeaah, no, bye!\" instead of her actually wanting to go on a date with me. \n\n\nTook me some time to wrap my head around it and thought no, there's so much I want to know about her this is gonna be great!\n\n\nI'm sure you are feeling it, the climax, nearly there. \n\n\nShe responded to me how awesome it was that I felt that way. but that she didn't want to go out with a co-worker. She wanted to keep her private and work life separated. As a newly rejectee I ofcourse politely said I understood and that I still thought she was a beautiful and lovely lady and wished her well in life. \n\n\nSo now I sit here. Reminding myself what a huge step I took. But feeling like I've been ran over by a freight-train. I feel so sad :(\n\n\nThanks for reading &lt;3\n\nEDIT: Thanks for all the uplifting comments :) just had pizza pity food so I'm feeling a little better about it :P",

I didn't even have the fear of having fear like at the previous gig.

            "selftext": "So I have misophonia or whatever, where I'm extremely sensitive to and become fixated on certain sounds like repeated tapping or chewing or just certain random sounds.  That seems to become more agitated when my general anxiety is higher. But lately what's bothering me is VOLUME of noise.  We live in an old house that requires window units for air conditioning, and they're just so loud that all the rest of the sound in the house needs to be turned up too. So the tv, voices, music, videos on phones... it all overwhelms me.  It feels like all this loud sound turns into physical walls that are closing in on me and crushing me and causing me physical pain, piercing my ears and vice gripping my head and flattening my chest.  Gah, I hate it!\n\nNo one in my family understands.  I was just awoken to my kids piling in my bed and turning on Netflix really loud to hear over the AC.  I turned it down just a notch or two and put my head under the pillow, but then my husband came in too and started watching videos on his phone in the bed with us.  So he had that at full blast and then my daughter turned the shows up even louder and then they're all trying to talk to me, and I just burst into tears and had to leave the room.  So waking up that way and having my day off to a bad start will ruin my mood for a couple hours I'm sure. I'm currently in a dark, quiet room with a LOCKED door trying to recooperate because I need to feed these kids so they can leave or something. \n\nI'm starting Zoloft soon for depression (currently pregnant and limited in what I can or am willing to take, Zoloft seems to be the least risky)... I believe that helps anxiety too right?  Lord I hope so.  It's been so awful and crippling lately, not just with the noise stuff but just sensory overwhelming in general.  I have friends with anxiety to whine to but no one with my kind of specifics, I just needed to get it out somewhere. I don't even care if anyone reads this. Ok actually I do. Please tell me your brain hates you too and let's commiserate. ",

Well that's what I've been doing all these weeks with these results. Honestly this is a crappy not the best job but I really feel bad not having given the results yet. Thank you to all who filled out the survey - all 1040 of you!?!!?!? I'm still reading though the comments portions so many great suggestions. :)\n\nAnyway - I put the image on my server/site so I can go back and maybe clean some stuff up. I *HAD* wanted to also put in comments that users put in and reply to them but times is so not on my side. I talk to much - I think too much - I should be stop typing and just post this already.\n\n#[Anxiety Results June 2015](http://therapyresources.org/anxietysubsurveyresults/anxietyresults2015.png)\n\nLets see here - of all the comment questions a few things I'd like to throw out there and get out of the way:\n\n    1. WE HAVE A CHATROOM!?!?\nHaving a hard time, want someone to talk to? We're in our irc channel there's tons of people we're really nice and helpful. I only say this because of the 1040 responses there were sooo many \"I wish there was a place we could all hang out/is there a chatroom/whatnot\" - anywho the link is on the dropdowns at the top of the page.\n\n    2. We have tips &amp; resources!!\nOk yah they are new, and I'm still building them, but I want to start actually having a weekly 'share your tips' type thing so we can all help each other with things that have worked and whatnot.\n\n    3. I like lists, and want to keep making this list but I've already typed wayyyyy too much. Any questions or comments or anything feel free to ask.\n\nI don't like that it didn't break between 3 &amp; 4 so I wrote something here.    \n  \n#####Your Friendly Ri0tnrrd\n\n\n",

I got Ds and Fs in High School and now I'm going to be starting college to get my degree in Computer Science so I can be a programmer...The problem is, going to college gives me such severe anxiety. I have this extreme phobia that I'm just too stupid to learn anything. Like I just keep having these images in my head of me reading textbooks, listening to lectures and trying really hard to learn things but it just doesn't...Stick...If that makes sense. I've had similar anxieties about learning new languages, like if I try to learn a second language I just won't be able to, like my brain won't process it. I just...I don't know...I can't fail college. I keep fearing I won't learn, I'll fail college which will make my girlfriend leave me and I can't go through that...I almost feel like I should just not bother with college and see if I can convince my girl to let me be a stay at home dad...But I don't think that will work, so I have no choice here...\n\nThanks for listening to my ramblings.

            "selftext": "I get super anxious about driving in new places. Break into a sweat, shaking, heart racing, can't think straight, nauseous, dizzy, that level of anxious. I've lived in Hawaii on Oahu for a month. I haven't driven around much at all because I don't have my own car and my husband usually has his. He is currently out to sea and the only time I've driven on my own since he's been gone, I managed to get incredibly lost on a military base and make an ass of myself. On top of lacking a sense of direction, my husband's car is broken. The drivers side door and window do not open. If I get pulled over it will be a nightmare. The safety inspection is expired on the car so even if I'm driving perfectly, there is obviously a reason to get pulled over. I would pay to park so I can sit and calm down but since the window and door don't work, I can't get the ticket from the machine. Ugh every time I think about it I can feel my heart racing. I've looked up the route on google maps obsessively and even followed it most of the way with street view so I knew exactly what the roads will look like and it did not help. I don't know what to do. I don't really have any friends who can help me out on the island.   \nEDIT: Update, I found a nice new service called Windward Isle Transport, they offer low flat rates to drive to different places all over the island and they are based out of the city I live in which is awesome. I'll keep them in mind for travel until we get the car fixed.They are bringing her here now and they even offered her free soda. Haha it all worked out. ",

            "selftext": "I was very worried the nights before as this was my first major surgery and I had never been put under. I haven't even really ever had a cavity-so no numbing shots either. When I had the chance to cancel getting them out last year, I did. I used the excuse my allergies were acting (no more than they are now). I just was so scared I avoided the problem.\n\nFrom last year, my roots had grown. I didn't know they still grow or I would have been more convinced to do it earlier! My roots had started to grow around my jaw nerve and the top ones had started to grow into my sinus cavity. If they had started to grow all the way in, they could have torn out my sinus cavity bone with them-which would have required more surgery. Now I realize why they advocate for wisdom teeth to be taken out younger the better, they grow like plant roots! Within a year, they had grown into a more dangerous position. Luckily I had a very skilled surgeon who knew what to expect.\n\nI was put totally under, and given a valium before. Amazingly some anxiety came through the valium but I didn't press it. It turns out that I am a chatty, happy person when doped up. I figured I would start sobbing uncontrollably or be angry at people for waking me (I am a very unhappy camper when woken up early). My boyfriend is also currently across the country so it was a worry I would start crying wanting him.\n\nSo far as I know, nothing went wrong. My surgeon removes teeth in addition to plastic surgery/facial reconstructive surgery so he really knows where all the nerves in the face are. I would definitely recommend to have an actual oral surgeon remove wisdom teeth if any are impacted. It is just SUCH a sensitive area and I would rather pay a bit more to make sure no nerves are injured. Even better if your surgeon also does other facial surgeries. My insurance covered some of it, we still had to pay quite a bit.\n\nThe only complication I might have is dry socket. Dry socket is apparently a really painful condition that can lead to infection. It also happens to happen to 50% of people on Birth Control (which I have been on since I was 13). So I'm hoping for the best, but its likely I will get it. Especially because I might cheat on my diet because I am starving and I want REAL food. No more liquids, ugh.\n\nSo overall the anxiety was worse than the actual operation. The pain isn't too bad, no worse when I clench my teeth due to anxiety. I have a high pain tolerance though, so I can't really speak for that. I heard the third day is the worst, but I just can't wait until I can eat real food!",

The only thing I have is severe health anxiety, which keep negative thoughts racing in my mind, especially when I'm in bed.\n\nThis kept me from sleeping well the last couple of months. I could count the days I got 7-8 hours on one hand, and mostly it's between 6 and 7 hours when things are more or less ok.\n\n I have periods where I don't get more than 3-5 hours of sleep for about 5  days on end. This really makes me anxious, because I already have this fear of dropping dead randomly because of a heart attack or whatnot, and it doesn't make things better to say the least. My anxiety symptoms get worse, the chest pains, palpitations and arm pains are worse too. I'm too tired to go outside and actually enjoy my day doing something active.\n\nMy doctor told me I won't drop dead anytime soon but that's harder to believe everyday I don't get enough sleep, when I have cold hands, chills, a stiff neck, hot flashes and tingly feelings in my chest.

I know it is more than nothing, it is disgusting and I don't deserve to be alive for letting my pets and wife live like this. \n\nI'm disgusting, all I do is hurt people, make people live in filth and destroy their families. And now I won't even have a job. At least when I had a paycheck there was something redeeming about me, now I am just the most worthless person in the world. And I can't even kill myself because I'm too pathetic. \n\nSorry for clogging this space, I just needed to type because my chest is going to explode right now. I hate myself, I always have and I always will. I need to not feel anything anymore. ",

People tell me \"oh, you shouldn't care what people think of you.\" *yeah, OK thanks. Let me just stop.*\n\nRight now I am hiding in my room because my mother in law heard me calling my husband for help when my baby threw up all over himself. That shouldn't be a big deal. But I heard \"really?\" Like the kind of really that translates into *are you fucking kidding me?*\n\nSo now I'm in my room crying, too afraid to go out there. \n\nThe other day, my mom asked me to watch her roast and put more water in it if it gets low. I did. But after I refilled it, it boiled out much faster than I expected. Burnt pan and roast... I automatically feel guilty and like I've ruined everyone's day.\n\nI think I know the cause of this. When I was growing up, if I breathed wrong around my mom or step dad I would get in trouble. I was always getting yelled at, always waiting around for the next screaming match. Always waiting to get my phone, TV privileges and friends taken away. I was always the outlet of everyone's anger. I was the least favorite kid and everyone knew it. I was always doing something wrong.\n\nNow I think it has made me a nervous adult. When someone is mad at me, even slightly annoyed, I get nauseous and my mind race s and I just want to be away from everyone. I don't want to ask anyone for help with anything because I think it translates into \"I'm retarded, I can't do anything for myself, nobody wants to be bothered with my problems.\"\n\nAnyone have any insight to help me better understand what the fuck Is going on with me?",

            "selftext": "Hey /r/Anxiety!\n\nI always love reading the little success stories that come up here and in different subreddits once in a while. I now have one of my own to share. It's not much, but it means the world to me.\n\nIt's the third time I'm writing this now, because I always keep coming up with wall of texts. Now I'm just gonna spare you the details on how my social anxiety developed. Just be assured it was so bad that I stayed at home and played online games for 16 hours a day for years instead of going to school/university. For the last six years, I had exactly... no IRL friends at all. I'm in my early mid twenties now, having achieved pretty much nothing. Fake edit: Wall of text again, sorry.\n\nAlright now comes the fun part. Way back then, shortly after said best friend just left me, there was some girl a few grades under me. At the time I had my hair dyed black (just trying new things), and because I was awkward and anxious, I didn't get it cut and instead grew it out. Well, said girl was in her emo phase at the time and apparently found me interesting. She chatted me up online in quite some creepy way (\"I always see you everyday in school\", I didn't even know who the fuck she was after she sent me pictures). We did get along well chatting though. She was so into me that we decided to go to a concert of my favorite band at the time. We met and bought the tickets, it was awkward as fuck, because we were both shy. That in itself was quite a feat. She kept wanting to meet me, call me, I always rejected and instead played some game. Long story short, we slowly drifted apart.\n\nFast forward 6+ terrible, very lonely years. Me at my little-social-interaction job with her coming up to my mind for whatever reason. I decide to reconnect to her when I am in a better spot in life. But I also decided to do that 3 years prior. So, instead of wasting even more precious years for no reason, I yolo past my anxiety and send her a message on some super old site that barely anyone even uses any more. \n\nDoesn't answer for three weeks after even logging in. I get the most terrible thoughts of what I did wrong and how much she hates me. Turns out she did answer, answer quite positively in fact, since she immediately said she wanted to meet me. I told her I'm still awkward and weird as hell (which isn't really true), she said she can easily deal with it *smiley face*. Oh my, that was so good to read.\n\nOf course, everything didn't go as planned. Over the course of two months, we tried to meet three times, each time falling through with nobody making concrete statements of where and when to meet. I was too afraid to ask her to meet up, she never said anthing either. We wouldn't send each other texts for weeks. Everytime I started assuming she just didn't care. I really thought she didn't. But then I also thought, she sounded so much interested before, why would she just change her mind for no reason? So each time, a day or two later, I'd just send a random text again. So in the end I would at least have tried. Sure enough, every time she also suggested again that we should still meet. Then again she'd forget to reply to more concrete meetup requests. It fucked with my head so much.\n\nSo for the 4th, *final time* I asked her again with more concrete times, and she didn't reply for 3 days straight again. I was about to give up. Instead I asked \"what is wrong with you\". Nothing, she forgot. And once again I said fuck it and just told her a time and place to meet. She agreed, this time we actually met.\n\nAnd it went better than expected. You know those crazy running, not-having-seen-each-other-for-months her-jumping-on-him hugs? Totally happened. So happy.\n\nAll the doubts and bad assumptions I had built up were completely invalid and stupid. I was so afraid of meeting her, because I thought I'd run out of things to say. In the weeks prior I thought of so many things I could talk about. But I thought I'd eventually run out of things to say and it would get awkward. In reality I didn't even get to talk about 10% of the things I planned to say (mostly because she talked 80% of the time, admittedly). She changed quite a bit and is no longer some shy person but instead very outgoing, has many friends and is generally just very busy in life.\n\nIt's all going good now. We're planning to go to three local events within the next 6 months. And whatever comes in between, we'll see, nothing else planned.\n\n\nAnyway. Maybe I'm lucky. But the one thing that I'm really happy about right now is that I kept trying. I would dwell on strings of negative thoughts and bad assumptions for weeks on end. Reasons for why she wouldn't text, reply, be unspecific and seem disinterested. Turns out she's actually just super busy IRL and barely getting along with that herself. Instead of dropping her over all those assumptions, I now even have someone that offered to listen to me if I want to talk about the awful past few years I had. Which is something I needed badly.",
