All because my boss,  the GM, will be out of town and the owner will be working in his place. \n\nIt's shit like this that drives me into therapy in the first fucking place. \n\nIt was huge for me to tell him no. I used to not be able to say No. I didn't want to be perceived as unreliable. However, his training fuck ups are not my problem. Between work and school and life, I don't have time or energy to cover his ass. \n\nNot only did I tell him No firmly, I also asked him never to ask that of me again, to think of the position that puts me in. And you know what? He was receptive and actually apologetic for it. \n\nSo today, I stood up for myself and things didn't fall apart. I didn't cry or cave in. I simply said no and explained that the idea is one I will never entertain. Success.\n\nEDIT: Thanks, y'all for your love and support! I am so glad this little story can inspire. There is hope for every single one of us. ",

Yesterday I called and setup an appointment with a psychiatrist and today had my first appointment. I was freaking out all morning and even on the way there, everything inside my head was telling me to turn around and not go. I'm so glad I went. The 45 minute session that we had felt like a major win for me and I'm in such a great mood now. I now have this feeling that there is hope and that I will be able to work through this.\n\n\nAgain, I wanted to say thank you to the community. I've been a lurker here for a long time now and finally built up the courage to take a stand against my anxiety.\n\n\nIf you're in the same boat I was. I know it's so hard but just do it. Take the step. It'll be so worth it!",

Lately I've been having protracted downwards-spiraling thoughts, laced with worry about being homeless, losing my animals, being out of school, lack of friendship, and loss of romance. \n\n\nInstead of trying to talk about how I felt and why, or seeking reassurance from loved ones, tonight I messaged a few of the people that are important to me and thanked them for their contributions to my well-being and role in my life. Letting them know how valuable *they* are to me forced me to understand I am cared for. Even without responses I felt relieved afterward. I feel like I can fall asleep now.\n\n\nI think next time I'm feeling anxious I should try counting my blessings again. DAE use this technique or a similar one?",

            "selftext": "I'd just like to share my experience with an online course I did for my anxiety (GAD). I couldn't recommend this course highly enough so I thought I'd post about it here!\n(Just a quick note, I'm not sure if those outside Australia can access this course. However they do have self help on their website.)\n\nAbout me:\nI've had anxiety for as long as I can remember, and had a stint of OCD when I was around 9ish years old. (I don't remember it much.) Last year, I started to have panic attacks and my anxiety got very bad; I had to drop out of uni, cancel a holiday and broke up with my boyfriend of 2 years. I was put on escilatopram (more commonly known as lexapro, 5mg, upped to 10mg after a few months.) I also visited a psychiatrist (who I didn't find useful at all.)\n\nHow I came across the online course:\nFellow Australians may have heard of the SBS program 'Insight'. Each episode focuses on a particular issue.. the episode I watched was on anxiety. It was very interesting and comforting to watch, as if made me feel like I wasn't alone. Anyway, there was a professor on there who talked about this online therapy, titled 'This Way Up.' I wrote down his name and forgot about it for a few months.\n\nhttp://www.sbs.com.au/ondemand/video/360897603960/Insight-S2014-Summer-Season-Anxiety\n\n^ link if you'd like to watch the Insight program. (Hopefully this link works outside of Australia!)\n\nWhy I started the course:\nMy psychiatrist prescribed me medication and that was it. She had no interest in finding out what caused me anxiety and how to deal with the root cause. I was SO frustrated. Although the medication was helping a lot (no more panic attacks, yay!), I felt like it was a bandaid solution. I also hated the side effects (weight gain, super drowsy all the time, feeling numb.) I wanted to treat the cause. Why was I anxious? And how did it get so bad?\n\nThe program:\nThis Way Up is an online cognitive behavioural program (CBT) course that has 6 lessons over 8 weeks. To sign up, you must get a prescription from your Doctor and it costs $55. (My doctor did it within 5 minutes and voila, I had access to the course.) I thought - what the hell, I have nothing to lose. I don't even have to get out of bed to do the course, I can do it from home hahaha.\n\nAfter a few months of procrastination, I finally got around to doing the course. The lessons took me between 20 minutes and 1 hour to do, 1x a week for 6 weeks. After each lesson you have homework to do for the week, which gradually gets harder. The first lot of homework I had to do was a breathing exercise and a bit of physical exercise. The rest of the lessons basically teach you to recognise your thought processes that induce anxiety and to retrain your brain to think realistically. (I don't know how else to explain it.)\n\nFor example:\nOne lesson talks about 'thought distortions.' Things that people with anxiety tend to think, which are totally unrealistic, but we convince ourselves that they are true. 'Catastrophising' was one of these distortions. I.e., you make a mistake at work. Instead of acknowledging you made a mistake and moving on, you think things such as I'm such a crap worker' and 'I'm totally going to get fired' etc etc. I'd never realised I do this, and during the course I learnt how to recognise this train of thought, stop it, and turn my thoughts into something more realistic.\n\nAnyway this is one of MANY MANY lessons I learnt during my course!\n\nMe after the course:\nI'm currently still on medication, but tapering off (2.5mg currently and no major issues, just headaches, lucky me), and have not had a panic attack in months. I've even put myself in situations which would have induced panic attacks (plane rides, small spaces), but have managed to calm myself down during techniques I learnt in the course. I'm still on a journey to get better, I'm not quite there yet, but this course has helped SO MUCH. I hope it may help some of you too :)\n\nYou and the course:\nI know the course is available to Australians, but not sure about people who are overseas. I couldn't find information on their website before I posted this. However there is a self help area that I'm sure could be useful.\n\nAlso, just like to say that this course is not a magic pill, even though I may make it sound like it is. I rave about it to the very few friends of mine that have anxiety (that I know about). It is merely a tool I have used in my journey to get better. I very very good tool. It isn't for everybody, but I'm sure everybody could learn a thing or two from it to help them on their journey :)\n\nHere's the link:\nhttps://thiswayup.org.au/\nThey also have courses for depression, social anxiety, OCD and one that mixes depression and anxiety. I'm yet to try any of the others.\n\nPS, please ask questions! I love to talk about this course. I've written this quickly on my phone, a spur of the moment thing - I only discovered this subreddit today! I hope this is the right place to post this.",

            "selftext": "Hey! This just came up to my mind again yesterday and I want to share it.\n\nA year ago I was a complete mess mentally, the anxiety was terrible and I suffered from derealization/depersonalization quite often when talking to people I knew on a personal level. I've had that for years and it didn't help with my anxiety at all.\n\nSo my brother had his 30th birthday, and for whatever reason he decided he wanted me there (I was 23). I knew it was gonna be a few people there at his apartment, I expected the friends I knew of him and some coworkers at his age as well. Not the best conditions for someone with terrible anxiety. I went anyway, thankfully.\n\nI didn't really talk to anyone and just sat there quite awkwardly. My brother got drunk real fast and stopped caring about me too much (which normally he does), so as time went on, I felt more and more out of place.\n\nBut then something happened that I could have never imagined. For clarification, he has a different father than me and I know next to nothing about that side of his family. We never talked about it in our family. But anyway. His cousin (some late 20s girl) came around, I've never seen her before. They also just recently met each other again. They told me the last time they saw each other was 15+ years ago when they were children. They randomly recognized each other when they were going out with friends.\n\nMy brother kept getting more drunk and in the meantime said cousin started talking with me. She was totally all over me, because I'm her cousin's brother she's never seen before. She's a certain type of girl I'll say, a few will recognize this. One of those people that look at you so hard when you're having a conversation, they're staring into your eyes straight into your soul. And not in a bad way. We talked about things I've never talked to someone about before, mostly the relationships we have in each of our families. She told me some things about her/my brothers family that I was never told about.\n\nAnd after a while of talking (and a good amount of awkward silences oh my), a few times she smiled and threw in the words \"*you're so likeable*\". Randomly thrown in and absolutely believable. Two or three times over the time we talked. Along with the occasional \"it's so incredible to meet my cousins brother\" and other sentences like that. She seemed to be quite happy about it all and said she hoped she'd see me again.\n\nThat made me feel so incredible back then and thinking about it still gives me the chills. I always thought I wasn't a person to have a nice conversation with. Instead someone I've never seen before tells me I'm a really nice person, unconditionally. And saying that was probably not a big deal for her. For me it was.\n\nIf you know someone who feels quite terrible about themselves, saying things like that can really lift them up. It helps **a lot** to be told that you're a likeable person while thinking you're being awkward and awful yourself. People with anxiety are so scared that the other person sees some sort of flaw in them. Being reassured of the exact opposite *helps so much*.",

Specifically the fear that people I work with will be mad at me.  \n\nI work in independent film production as a team leader so I don't really have a boss; there are supervisors to make sure everything is done legally and safely, but they don't tell people what to do.  It's my fellow department heads that conjures the anxiety and damn, it's getting me good.\n\nTypical chest tightness, trouble breathing, stomach issues, insomnia, and it's been causing a lot of physical tension in my neck and shoulders.\n\nYou know fight/flight/fright?  I'm stuck in fright and can feel myself wanting to hide; avoiding answering the phone; avoiding email; avoiding texting.  All from this fear that my coworkers are going to be mad at me.\n\nWhen I search the feeling deeper I think I fear them being mad at me because (*I believe*) I'm not working hard enough; or not trying hard enough; or that I'm not doing my job well.  That they'll find out that I'm actually lazy and entitled and that I don't want success bad enough or that I don't have what it takes to be successful in the film industry.\n\nAt this point I'm ramble posting.  Just needed to share and type this out.  Anyone else deal with fear/anxiety in this particular way?",

But, ironically, it can also be difficult for people with anxiety to put themselves out there and comfort others.  So in order to encourage everyone, we're forming The Anxiety Support Society!  In an effort to decrease pressure, there won't be any official membership list, or any obligations.  But you can help by:\n\n* Upvoting any posts you see which are asking for help\n* Commenting, even if it's short, just to let people know that you care.  You might want to consider targeting posts that don't have comments.\n* Sending a personal message.  This can really mean a lot, especially if OP (or you) have trouble talking in a public place like this.\n* Using this thread to discuss any anxieties you have about posting or commenting on this subreddit\n* Using this thread to point out anyone who might need support, even if they've never posted in this subreddit\n* Using this thread to point out any posts that you think are particularly urgent \n\nSo that's a lot to take in, but hopefully some people are interested. :)\n\n",
