I told him how, mostly, when I was a kid, but also sometimes these days, if my parents tell me they'll get home at a certain time, and they don't, I automatically assume the worse, which is that they got into a car crash and died.\n\nHe understood exactly what I was taking about and broke down. He started crying on my shoulder because he always thought he was crazy. It makes me sad to know he felt alone this entire time. \n\nSo this is just reminder to all of you, that no matter what hell your mind is putting you through, you're not crazy, and you are especially not alone. \n\nI hope you are working on your happiness, calmness, and enjoying the journey that is life.",

I went to the Monday classes for each one, then just couldn't go back for the Wednesday or Friday, and now I'm terrified that it's all going to catch up with me, and I'll flunk out.\n\nI'm on Spring break now and I had a pretty bad attack last night, thinking about the consequences of how much class I've missed. I decided that I have to start attending fully next week when class picks up again.\n\nI'm just starting to find out that the things I've been dealing with for years are related to anxiety.

I started petting him and I actually felt a lot better. It's bizarre, because all of my issues were still there and none of them were even remotely treated, but his warm, fluffy fur and the fact that he was just happy I was there was comforting. And then he started letting me rub his belly, and holy shit. If you have a cat, and you feel up to the challenge, try rubbing its belly. If it bites and scratches you, obviously you can't. But, if your cat enjoys it, you have a gift. Because it is the most awesome thing. I felt more serene than I had felt in an entire week rubbing my cat's belly and hearing him purr contently while reaching his paws to the sky. If you feel shitty, pet your cat. If you don't have a cat, see if you can get one. They are awesome anxiety diversions.",

            "selftext": "Just wanted to get this off my chest because I'm nervous. I'm 23 years old and have experienced anxiety since I was a young child. My particular anxiety comes from fear of failure, the unknown of the future, not having control, and decision making (I experience pretty serious analysis paralysis.).\n\nI've never done anything about my anxiety. When I was about 20 was the first time I ever made my family aware of the severe anxiety that I suffer from, and I've certainly never mentioned it to counselors of any kind, or medical professionals. I'll be going to my family doctor to discuss my problem and hopefully get a referral to a psychiatrist in order to begin some form of therapy, perhaps medication (though, preferably not, but I guess we'll see), and whatever else. \n\nLast week I reached rock bottom and knew it was time for me to finally push through the anxiety I have about getting help (nothing makes me feel failure quite like the inability to handle my own emotions) in hopes of changing my life for the better. I feel like my anxiety is holding me back -- nothing about my life is the way I want it, even if there isn't anything particularly wrong with my life. My fears have stopped me from following any paths that I've ever considered for myself because I've been terrified of failing at it, and also been afraid of not knowing where that path will take me and whether it would truly make me happy. So I've allowed others to make decisions for me, which has resulted in me living a life I never would have chosen for myself. I'm not exactly ready to take my life back because the prospect is terrifying, but I can't possibly live this way anymore so I need to take it back, ready or not. I just hope I can...\n\nUpdate is [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/2xxe8w/update_i_have_an_appointment_with_my_family/).",

I tried going to the aboutbfs.com forums for some healthy reassurance that it was nothing, but due to spam issues, I found out that the site takes **awhile** before your account is validated. I wanted answers now, though, so I found myself over at the ALSforums. \n\nBad idea.\n\nI read some of the stories of the PALS there and convinced myself I had ALS. I shut down. I quit my job, lost all my friends, and found myself having panic attacks daily for months completely alone while developing all sorts of new neurological \"symptoms\". What's worse is that I was now incessantly bugging people who actually had this horrible disease to try and qualm my own fears like a selfish ass.\n\nJust recently have I been able to slowly convince myself that I'm not dying. I've ruined a good portion of what were supposed to be some of the best years of my life (my 20s), and I don't want other people to go through the same. \n\nSo, I've decided to start an alternative community for those like me: [BFS Forums](http://www.bfsforums.com). I've just launched the site and have invested a lot of time, money, and energy into it because this is something I care about. I also am an Emory alumni and have connections with the medical school (well-known for its ALS clinic and for being on the cutting-edge of drug design) and am talking to some neuros and other specialists to do some articles and answer some forum questions to help calm people's fears. \n\n**The website also allows for users to create groups with their own forums, so if you're suffering from any other forms of health anxiety, please feel free to create your own little community/forum to discuss your issues. We don't turn people away.**\n\nTL;DR - After going through months of daily anxiety attacks, I started a site to help people with health anxiety, specifically BFS. The site's new, but please help me get this jump-started. I think it could do a lot of good. [BFS Forums](http://www.bfsforums.com)",

Here goes...\n\nSo, went to my family doctor and asked her about a referral -- she asked for what and I explained my issues. She wanted full details. After being very attentive and sympathetic, writing down everything I said, she asked lots of questions about my moods and other things, and said there were lots of different options for someone like me. She then asked what it was that I had in mind in regards to the sort of help I was looking for, whether I was hoping to look into counseling, medication, etc. She explained there are a number of different possible medications, anti-depressants, and a ton of other things but that she thinks it would be best to hold that off as an option, but not a first move -- unless I felt my anxiety was so severe that I couldn't get through my day to day life anymore without something to help calm me down.\n\nI explained that I was open to medications if necessary, but that it wasn't my first choice as I'd rather learn to deal with my issues around decision making, the future, fear of failure, etc. rather than just numb the anxiety. She agreed that was an excellent choice and wrote down a number of websites and resources for me to check out regarding CBT. I also discussed how I don't have insurance and how I'd love to do some actual therapy, but I can't afford it. She gave me a referral to a free mental health clinic -- unfortunately because this is a free government service, it is intended to be short term counseling rather than ongoing, indefinite support, but that it would be beneficial for whatever time I could have there. She then told me that she'd like to see me again in a month to see how things are going and told me that if I feel like I need to explore medication, we can look at it at that time, or if things get worse before then to come in sooner if I need to.\n\nI then went over with my referral to the mental health clinic -- different building in the same parking lot. They had me fill out some paperwork that had questions regarding what brought me there, etc. so I filled that out. Based on that, they will assign me a specialist from the facility that best fits my needs and will be in touch next week to set up an appointment.\n\nSo, yeah... That's that! I'm nervous about this whole thing, but simultaneously relieved. I'm also worried that I'm hoping for too much in the short amount of time I have considering this is short term counseling. Either way, I'm glad that I've made the first steps. I look forward to the day when my anxiety no longer clouds my mind and holds me back from making decisions and pursuing my dreams. Thank you to everyone who gave me information and offered their kind words. Its been greatly appreciated.",

The feeling of falling in love, the feeling of finding someone you considered was your kindred spirit, the person who gave meaning to your life, the first person who actually cared about me that deeply.

Now over the past few years i have meditated, learned, and become patience and understanding the world and myself. I have came to concur many of my fears and anxieties. But this one, the one that allows you to gain a income for a stable life. That leads to being able to strive for goals. That one i have just always struggled with. New environments, New people, bosses, co workers, it all gets to me in the time there as it drags on like a Salvador dali painting. This time though i new myself and thought i was going to do great, make it through in a new place with so much around. And they dont even bother to call me and say youre fired. After 2 days working my ass off and having mini panic attacks so I could go home at the end and say at least i made some money today. Now i have to start the looking again, with a slight knock to my self but it doesnt deter me. Even if this world is weird, off, whatever you have it in your immediate reality. Take it and make it better. I know i am trying, Sorry for the rant again needing to just spit 4 years of not having a consular and dealing with my own person out into existence. I dont know many of you or any of you. I am sure to hope to know you all someday. ",

However, then I start to think that I Shouldn't feel this way, because by doing so, I won't be able to deal with the worst and It will catch me off guard.
