It's a 5 week group course designed specifically for treating anxiety and depression with focus on tackling low self-esteem. \n\n\n***Edit:* Thank you for all the kind words! Seeing as so many wanted an update I thought I should deliver.** \n\nSo session one went well, the hardest part was definitely making sure I didn't bail at the last minute (I almost did, really glad I made it). There are 8 of us in the CBT group, so some basic introductions were made and some pretty important ground rules were outlined i.e. No judgement, confidentiality etc. \n\nThe counsellor talked us through the plan for the next 5 weeks, got us to consider how we felt and to set a realistic improvement target.\n\nThe session itself involved working in groups of 4 and brainstorming about various topics such as:\n\n* Family and outside events that might lead to low self-esteem.\n*  Your feelings and behaviours that have resulted from low self-esteem.\n\nOverall, I am glad I took the plunge with a CBT course; it is still early days and I'm worried I am one of those people it doesn't help. Not going to give up though! Expect updates from me in the future about how the whole course goes.\n\n\n",

I'm a 23 year old male who was diagnosed with panic disorder when I was a junior in High School. I came a long way since then and was able to cope with my depression and anxiety attacks for a while until about 2 weeks ago I had a traumatic experience with thinking I had diabetes because I'm overweight. I went to my psychologist and told him that I'm afraid that I had a relapse. He flat out told me that it sounds like I did and that he doesn't know what to do since I'm on the highest levels of medication(1mg Alprazolam, 150mg Effexor) but to change my medication and see him often. He made it seem like the relapse was my fault. I don't know what to do anymore, I'm crying as I type this even though my brother keeps telling me men shouldn't cry. I don't even know how I'm gonna go to work tonight cause I have bills and credit cards to pay and can't stop working. I tried dropping down to 7 credits this semester but I still have a bad panic attack on the way to school and in class.

            "selftext": "[help]\n\nI can't keep up in class. I can't do it. It's too. Damn. Hard. It's too hard oh my god.\n\nI was so codependent on my boyfriend, it was a toxic relationship but now that it's over, I really have nothing. No goals, no self-esteem, nothing. I'm lost. No plan. I had no friends in the area and still don't.\n\nYesterday was my birthday. You know what I did? I went out to meet an acquaintance I made in class, we had even hung out over the summer (same internship), I get there and she never showed. Bailed on me. Even though I planned it weeks in advance and she said she was going but not only did she not show, she didn't text me or call letting me know she wasn't coming or what was going on. She only responded to my one text today with \"sorry I was tired\" hahahaha. So I hooked up with my ex now I feel like I can't give him up, not because I think it'll work, but because he is literally the only person who cares about me.\n\nMy sister lives in SLC, where you're basically fucked if you're not Mormon (and I'm not and never will be). I lived there for 2 years myself and hated it, I couldn't make friends or date because I wasn't religious and it *always* came back to religion and converting me and it was incessant discomfort. My parents live on a ranch in the back-end of nowhere, 1 hour to the nearest grocery store, I'm fucked going out there living with them, there's nothing out there for me, even less than here. I would become a basement person and they would kick me out.\n\nTrying to go to therapy but the campus counseling center is so booked they can only work me in twice a month. I'm on waiting lists for the 2 other places in town offering therapy and it's been months and I've never gotten a call. Fuck.\n\nI have enough credits to graduate with an Independent Studies degree but that's a joke, I might as well drop out right? Drop out and move far away and become a waitress or work at Staples and just live even more anonymously until I finally go out, buy at least 3 sturdy boards, lay them across my cabinets, toss a rope over them, lay down a tarp underneath me so my rotting corpse doesn't stain the tiles and hang myself. And I would rot too because not a single fucking person around here even knows I exist, let alone would check on me.\n\nIt's thoughts of suicide every waking moment. It's gotten worse and worse over the past few months and all my therapist says is \"take a de-stress day, try going to yoga.\" Well I de-stressed my grades into the fucking hole because even the thought of homework makes me sick so instead of doing it I do yoga. Also I've eaten my weight and vomited it all several times in the past week and it helps a little with the stress.\n\nI'm a train wreck. A week ago I called the suicide hotline and this woman, I kid you not, would pause so fucking long that I had to ask \"Are you there?\" several times to get her to say something. I go on about my situation and she says, \"What are your hobbies?\" I tell her I don't have any and she does another long pause and says, \"Well there isn't a magical solution to all of your problems, like there's no magical wand you can wave and everything will work out,\" and I'm like *are you fucking kidding me.* I ask her what to do. What can I do? I'm so fucking exhausted and tired. She says, \"Well talking helps a little bit, right?\" Well if talking helped I wouldn't be in this fucking mess holy shit.\n\nWhat do I do? What can I do? This semester I'm doing nothing but re-taking classes I've already failed, *and I'm failing them again holy christ.* It's like I go into lecture and my whole body gets full of white noise, I can't hear the professor, my heart races and my gut froths up.\n\nFuuuck. Fuck fuck. My life is over, right? It's fucking over.\n\n---\n\n**Update:** Wow I can't believe these responses... you guys are amazing. Today I was able to think more clearly, although the panic still came back around a few times. I reached out to my family; my parents were very helpful, they encouraged me and helped me make a little game plan and they didn't judge me for getting back into contact with my ex, but my sister was angry about that (she hates him), so that made me feel quite bad, but I'm still a step up from where I was. I still don't know what to do about a lot of my issues, but I've calmed down enough to realize I don't have to figure everything out immediately. Your posts made me think about the options. Also, to those saying it's alright for me to pm you, I might actually do it, so be careful what you offer \ud83d\ude2a",

These symptoms immediately made me think, \"oh fuck, I'm going into cardiac arrest.\" It was pretty damned stupid of me to think I was about to have a heart attack, but that's what it felt like.\n\nFor the longest time, I've had this problem where my heart rate would increase for no reason. Out of the blue. In addition to that, I'd get lightheaded and usually found it very hard to breathe. I didn't know that this was an anxiety issue until this morning, when I asked my roommate about it. She said she experienced the same thing and explained why it was a thing that happened. Up until I'd asked her, I just thought I was in some serious shit that had nothing to do with my anxiety.\n\nI knew I had terrible anxiety (diagnosed and all that good shit), but I just wasn't ever told that these random symptoms that make you think you have a heart condition were a part of that. I feel pretty dumb. I should've known. This whole fucking time I was scared that I had like, *arrhythmia* or some other heart condition that was going to kill me someday. No idea why I never saw a doctor about it, but now I'm glad I didn't. Because this morning I learned that it was just a fact of my goddamn anxious life. I would've felt pretty damned stupid walking into a doctor's office and freaking out about a nonexistent heart condition. God, I do work myself up over these things an awful lot.\n\nI don't know, guys. It's just annoying. It's really fucking annoying. I hate it. I'm considering biting the bullet and getting some meds. I don't know if I can handle this anymore. It's been a problem for years, and it hasn't gotten any less terrifying.\n\nI just want to be able to relax without my heart feeling like it's about to explode. Seriously, I was having a nice and quiet evening to myself. Fuck this shit. Fuck anxiety. As soon as I can, I'm going to get on meds.\n\n**EDIT:** All of you are supportive and amazing. Thanks for sharing your experiences. I'm sorry I didn't respond to everyone's comments, but I just woke up and I'm not awake enough. I appreciate you all taking the time to respond, though.\nIn any case, I'm going to go seek medical help just in case! There are a couple things that, after reading this thread, I want to get checked for. I'd like to 100% know what's going on with me so I can better cope with the anxious feelings this gives me. Once again, thank you all for sharing! I appreciate it.",

I go with the flow and am normally a very happy person. I love interacting with people and making new friends. \n\nMy wife is the exact opposite. It's very hard for me to make friends because she doesn't want to hang out with them and when I suggest that I hang out with them by myself she gets very upset because she feels like I'm ditching her. \n\nI try my best to help her. I do everything I possibly can to help her. I talk to her about her problems and I try to keep her mind off things that trigger her anxiety. Most of the time she stays quiet. She doesn't wanna have loud, exciting conversations like I do. She just wants to be quiet, and I respect that. I give her her space. \n\nLately it's been particularly bad. I asked her if she would be okay with seeing a therapist. I told her that I needed help to help her and I think we would both benefit from talking to people. She took that and got pissed. Furious. She was so mad at me. She stormed out of the room and hasn't talked to me sense. I need help. Its getting hard for me and I want help too. \n\nWhat do I do?",

It got to the point where I didn't want to do anything but be in my room and watch movies (which is so not me, because I am highly extroverted). \nFinally, I mentioned to my doctor about all this, and she recommended that I try a low dose of cipralex, which is technically an anti-depressant but works for anxiety as well.\nWELL. Within a week, I started to feel like myself again. I actually wanted to go to class, hang out with people, and spend time outside of my room. The little things that were stressing me out stopped scaring me. I stopped being worried about what other people thought of me, and started speaking in class.\nI've been on Cipralex for about 2 years now.
