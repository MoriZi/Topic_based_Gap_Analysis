            "selftext": "I hung out with a girl about a week ago for the first time. We didn't do much, basically just watched movies and cuddled a bit. However, even though we've only hung out once, I already find myself thinking of her as MY girlfriend, and constantly wondering what she's doing, who she's with, etc.  I have generalized anxiety, and until now I haven't realized that it's also affecting my relationships. Past relationships of mine have ended because of me being crazy jealous, getting upset when they won't hang out, etc.  Does anyone else have these type of obsessive/anxiety related problems in their relationships?  If so, are there effective strategies to help this issue?  I feel like I can't even focus because I can't stop thinking about the girl, wondering when she's going to next text me, etc.  This is really starting to bother me. I don't want to be a bad and obsessive lover, but I feel like I can't help it.",

            "selftext": "I know that there is some controversy around Emotional Support Animals: how legitimate they are, how all pets give \"emotional support\", etc. However, I am here to share my experience and hope that it helps/relates to others who also own Emotional Support Animals, or those who are considering one. Apologies in advance for the long post.\n\n\nI am 25F and I have struggled with various anxiety disorders since childhood (OCD, GAD, depression). My disorders severely worsened around the age of 15-16, and my general health has suffered since then. For the past decade or so, it has been incredibly difficult for me to build a routine and show up to work/school. Throughout my undergraduate degree, my attendance rate was probably about 5% (I still graduated with good grades, thanks to self-study and the school's understanding). I graduated in 2012 and have since enrolled into two graduate programmes - both of which I had to withdraw from due to my health. In 2014, I decided to switch to psychology in order to understand myself better and to help others. However, my health and academic performance continued to suffer and I was cycled through multiple types of medication for my disorders, some of which made me really sick. I felt trapped, almost imprisoned, in my bedroom and felt intimidated by life. Was I ever going to feel okay?\n\n\nIn August this year, I adopted a little rescue puppy. She has changed my life. My health, both mental and physical, is better than it has been in years despite several hiccups in my life. For the first time in 5-6 years, I am able to live without *any* psychiatric medication. For the first time in about a decade, I have not missed any classes, assignments, or exams, for a whole school term. My quality of life has improved dramatically and I have more energy that I've had in a while.\n\n\nI don't know what it is about her precisely that helps me so much. Maybe it's the fact that she is always incredibly happy to see me, that I know she will never judge me, that I will never disappoint her as a person. I still struggle with my disorders, but she has done more for me in a few months than any medication or therapy has in years.\n\n\nIt really disheartens me when people dismiss Emotional Support Animals as silly or superfluous, because I fear that it discourages others from considering one. Not all disorders or disabilities are visible. Nobody truly understands your experiences other than yourself. Ironically, it gives me even more anxiety knowing that people will question the legitimacy of my Emotional Support Animal when I bring her to places with me, or even ask about why I need her. At the end of the day, your Emotional Support Animal is for *you* and no one else.\n\n\nDoes anyone else have an Emotional Support Animal or a Service Dog? Has anyone had similar experiences? To anyone who is considering one, please feel free to ask if you have any questions. :)",

            "selftext": "Lately I'm finding myself hoping I'll have some sort of psychotic break or some sort of major symptoms so that someone can tell me what's wrong with me.  My therapist thinks I may have ptsd but hasn't yet made an official diagnosis.  But it feels like this is also something else going on too. \n\nI have a history of moving frequently to avoid \"something ambiguous\"  basically I start developing this really  severe anxiety during certain points of my life\" I don't yet know what this anxiety is but moving to a new location helps... \n\n\nIdk I just feel like I'm constantly keeping this secret from myself at bay so I don't freak out...its annoying because when I push these symptoms away I can function like a normal person... But like three times a year (usually when I'm not able to ignore whatever this is any longer) I go into this state of mind where I fear for my life because this feeling has resurfaced.. \n\n\nAlso I don't handle criticism well and internalize most people's anger or criticism thinking that I must have done something wrong...(im working on being aware of this)... \n\nMy emotions fluctuate and and shift depending on other people's reactions to me or lack thereof. \n\nI also have no sense no sense of self like I do not know who I am... I feel lost\n\nI'm working with my therapist on these issues but I feel all mixed up and worry I'll just run again because I'm scared \n\nSo,  Anyone else feel like they just want to allow themselves to have a break down or a nice freak out where people in your life will finally see the pain you're going through  and take you seriously?\n\n\nTL/DR: I want to break down so something ambiguous can finally have a name ",
