I stayed in for the most part.\n\nNow some girl told me she'd make me dinner tomorrow evening, and I'm seriously uncomfortable to leave the house and go there, like what the hell. I experience the same thing with my weekend plans, I'm supposed to go to a gig with some friends.\n\nIt's like the anxiety conditioned me to stay in my bubble and it feels very weird. It's a kind of agoraphobia but not really. My heart is pounding in anxious anticipation of activities, while a couple of months ago I didn't have a problem with it at all.",

After I graduated high school, my long time gf broke up with me, all my friends moved to different schools while I was still at home. \n\nI was depressed and my anxiety caused many panic attacks during this time, my grades slipped also. I talked to my parents a lot about this, just trying to get help. They tell me I'll grow out of it, and that I just need to calm down. I tried a couple medications throughout the year, and explaining to my mother that some just won't work well with me. She claimed I was wasting money, and that anxiety and depression isn't a chemical imbalance in the brain like my doctor told me, and that I just need to grow up. \n\nOther than this, my mother is completely loving and does everything for me. But she stresses me out so much. I've since brought my grades up and my anxiety is manageable currently. I'm still working and saving up, and decided recently I want to go to a college 2 hours away. \n\nMy younger brother just graduated high school and is going to one of our states top public college and they are 100% supportive of him, always talking about it. But no support for me at all it seems, and they tell me it's stupid to leave and not commute to the local college I got accepted into. \n\nI want to go to the school two hours away, because I love the school, I love the program and I also want to leave this house. They don't understand that they make my anxiety flare up constantly throughout the week, always wanting to start fights over small things, just complaining 24/7. I've just started noticing this year how much of my anxiety is because of living here still, and my parents. God I love them, but it's too much for me now.\n\nThey tell me that I'll just get worse anxiety when I'm 2 hours away and on my own. When I actually visited friends at their colleges and stayed for a couple days, hung out and went to events and I had a blast, yeah sure I had a bit of anxiety but I managed and I ended up having fun. I didn't want to go home when visiting. Right now I'm waiting to hear back from the college, and just start the process of moving hopefully. \n\nDoes anyone else have this sort of problem?",

            "selftext": "As my title states, I'm a hypochondriac. It's pretty much where all of my anxiety lies. I'm not afraid of social situations, relationships, work, school, etc. Just my health. And damn, am I ever scared of my health. Over the past year I've had numerous scans done, seen multiple medical professionals, tons of blood work done, symptom checked til I cried, locked myself inside, stopped eating, and so, so much more. You name it and I've probably been checked for it. It's been out of control. \n\nIn April I noticed a swelling on the right side of my neck. My anxiety was doing okay at this point so I let it be for a while. In June the swelling was still there and had gotten much worse. I got a terrible headache and went to see an ENT and a neurologist. I had an MRI and it looked fine. Good news right? Not for a hypochondriac! Good news means keep searching. Thankfully I did this time (maybe)! I went back to this ENT to talk about the big lump on my neck and she brushed me off. In true anxiety fashion I went for a second opinion. I got a referral for a CT scan and BAM huge lymph nodes in my neck. Had an ultrasound done this week and the cervical lymph nodes on either side of my neck are double the size they should be. Going to get a biopsy in a month if nothing has changed. My doctor is talking to me fairly seriously about lymphoma (and of course other illnesses, I know there are other things that could be causing this, but there is concern about lymphoma because of some other health/life details I haven't shared here). \n\nWhen I first heard lymphoma I was terrified. I cried and cried and just couldn't deal with the idea that I might have cancer. A few days later I realized...WTF? WTF am I doing? What have I been doing the past YEAR?! Fretting about my health and not doing things I enjoy. I'm 25 years old. I'm relatively healthy. Even if it turns out I have cancer, am I going to let that kill me? Definitely not. It honestly feels somewhat freeing for something solid to be potentially wrong with me. I feel like I can relax a lot more now. There's something wrong (whatever it is) and I can treat it. I can deal with it and move on in my life. I mean, what's left to be afraid of?! \n\nI guess the point of my post is...I feel better. I'm worried about my potential diagnosis but I'm going to fucking enjoy myself in the meantime! I'm going to spend time with friends, hang out with my animals, go camping, and just everything else. Unfortunately all it took was actually being sick! Has anyone else had an experience like this? I just find it so interesting/absolutely fucked up that this has been the wake up call for me. I've finally had to face the thing I'm the most afraid of (illness and ultimately death) and it isn't as scary as I thought. Shit.  \n\n",

It gets in the way of everything, and sometimes makes even the most mundane of tasks impossible.\n\nAnxiety isn't cool. It gets you Tumblr reblogs, sure, but true pain is suffered in silence. No post can display the pain, the suffering, the hurt. Having it doesn't make you friends. Worrying about your next exam is normal. Worrying about walking past your front gate isn't.\n\nAnxiety isn't romantic. People don't fantasize about being with someone anxious. Sure being \"shy\" or quiet might be cute, but it definitely isn't desirable for that person.\n\nAnxiety is real. People suffer. You can deny it inside for as long as like but it is there. Pushing it to one side isn't gone. A footballer sitting on the bench is still a part of the game and could be the difference between winning or losing. Anxiety could strike at any time and is not to be dumbed down.\n\nThat's anxiety. But life itself is good. People care about you. There are people that talk to you, and you talk back. There are people that can make you feel better about yourself, and that's amazing. I think realizing this made me approach my anxiety in a whole new light.\n\nI'm not a very active poster but I am definitely an active reader. Some posts on here are amazing. There are amazing people on here that can help others more than they know how to.\n\nI'm learning to love life again, and the love of life sometimes feel greater than the anxiety within and that's what urges me forward. The first few weeks for me were terrible. I was in denial. I can see that now. Looking back I was never willing to accept I was unwell, and that feeling is so restrictive.\n\nI hope everyone here finds that drive. Treatment is the training for the marathon. Having a day without anxiety and doing what you love is the starting pistol going off. Life is there to be lived and its amazing once you let it be. I'm a year and a bit into this now, medication free. I wanted to do it without and despite being prescribed as a worse case situation, 'you need to take this for your treatment to go anywhere' kind of thing. Anybody can do it.\n\nI now love life and I can't wait to experience it. I'm not there yet, but I can see it in the near future. I hope you all have an amazing day and you find the love that helps you through everything. I feel like this applies for any setback in life too. Sometimes being such an insignifcant person in life scares people, but it's the greatest thing there is. Humans control this world now, and we're all humans embracing that. I'm writing this partly for other people and partly to remind myself. It's easy to forget theres a world outside of the mind and sometimes taking it by the cuff and challenging it head on is the right thing to do. Thank you all.",

I feel stuck, scared, and hopeless. The best way I can describe it is it feels like I have bad scrapes on my feelings.  It just plain hurts, and I can't do anything to get rid of it.  I want to run away, but I don't want to be anywhere where people might see me.  Cutting helps a bit, but I am trying not to do that.\n\nDoes anyone else experience this problem?  Do you have a solution to it?\n\nEDIT:  This time, at least, the solution appears to be waiting two hours, because it resolved itself eventually.

            "selftext": "Hi I'm a long time lurker or Reddit and a long-term sufferer of anxiety. The first step is to educate yourself on what anxiety is caused by and then how you can deal with **your body**\n\n\nI have found only just recently that learning to control your breathing and completely filling your lungs slowly through your nose and then exhaling slowly throughout either your nose or mouth. \n\n\nKeep in mind that you must breathe slowly and not force your lungs to intake or let out more or less air than they need, just find the sweet spot. I believe focusing and trying to maintain this breathing pattern during a panic attack or general anxiety gives your body a chance to regulate its O2 thus regulating heartbeat and blood flow to your brain and body.\n\n\nIt may not be easy at first but please believe that it will be okay and give itbthe time it needs and if you just keep trying to maintain that beathing pattern.\n\n\nIf it helps, sing it in your head like how Dory from Finding Nemo sings-\n\nJust keep swimming\njust keep swimming\njust keep swimming swimming swimming\nwhat do you do you swim swim swim.\" \n\nA few things that I read that gave me some insight:\n\n-[1](http://www.helpguide.org/articles/anxiety/panic-attacks-and-panic-disorders.htm)\n\n-[2](http://www.adaa.org/understanding-anxiety/panic-disorder-agoraphobia/symptoms)\n\n-[3](http://www.anxietycoach.com/causes-panic-attacks.html) This one really helped me\n\n-[4](http://www.webmd.com/anxiety-panic/guide/coping-with-anxiety)\n\n\nNow the reason I made this post was to just share some already widely known information. I really believe that learning to breathe properly again gives your mind the chance to think for itself instead of being stuck. If I could even help one person out and change how they view their body and their overwhelming anxiety. \n\n\nThe biggest problem I am faced with is the general publics understanding of, and many other mental disorders,  is that people remain ignorant and lack the understanding or empathy for the people who just don't get it because they never knew how to control it. The worst thing is that the general media plays it off as a breakdown or a meltdown and that can really mess with the way people think about it if they don't really know. The hardest thing to do is to help yourself when you're not thinking clearly, so stay safe, stay hydrated, keep eating, keep breathing, and kids.. don't do drugs.\n\n*edit 1 formatting",

I have made 0 friends and haven't had a serious girlfriend and the mild depression i have has turned into a struggle too keep out of my head. I long for a long term relationship and feel lonely as fuck but my social skills have completely disappeared. My social anxiety got worse as a result, to the point where I have dreams of people rejecting/judging the fuck out of me. I'm a hermit compared even to what I used to be socially. Recently (about 6 months ago) I got pissed at my self for being a bitch about this whole thing and made an attempt to wonder out of my shell. I started talking to people but made an effort to talk to more girls as to maybe find someone I got along with and maybe turn into something serious. Fuck was I wrong. Still 0 friends and the anxiety tells me they are going to hate me before I start talking or even approach them and during the conversation I'm constantly judging myself and all the stupid shit that comes out of my mouth. I met a girl not too long ago who showed to be reciprocating; needless to say, she wasn't interested; i know this because the next day she showed up at the gym with a male friend/SO (I met her at the gym at university) something she never did for the couple months I had seen her until I worked up the courage to spend more time talking to her than the usual \"hello\" and small talk. I know it's fucked to base my worth on other people and what they may think of me but this experiences wrecked my self confidence. I can't fucking even cry anymore. I can let all this frustration/anger/sadness out of me. Fuck this FUCKTHIS FUCK THIS feeling. I can't fucking breath. There's a big knot in my throat.

Then my anxiety tells me every day I go into work that this is the day my boss is going to realize I'm not doing a good job, and is going to replace me, and I really need the money, and I am in a state of panic and fear that I could lose my job, even though she is like the nicest person on the planet and knows that I need the job to survive right now. But I find myself completely overwhelmed, which is not something that normally happens to me, sitting at my desk and staring at the paperwork, as if I've forgotten what I'm supposed to do with it. I'm so behind on things I need to do, but I just can't seem to force myself to do what I need to. So basically, depression makes me suck at my job, giving me anxiety, and subsequently making me more depressed.\nI'm not sure why I'm explaining all this; there's probably some people who are in the same situation...

            "selftext": "So. I woke up this morning nervous. The trunk of my car was open, which may have been an accident, but it made me worried because it's a brand new car. I didn't have anything valuable in there, but my god if something happened to it, I would feel horrible. My boyfriend bought it after we sold my old neon because it was falling apart and gave me the ownership of it.\n\nThen this afternoon I had an intake appointment to start some weekly counseling. Last time I did counseling sessions was before I was diagnosed and the student counselor didn't listen to me at all. I explained I was having panic attacks and could barely leave the house, and he just wanted to talk about my family and history instead of giving me intervention help. For today, I showed up early, filled out a form, then waited. And waited. 20 minutes after my appointment, she finally comes out, even though I filled out the paperwork 30 minutes before the appointment started so I was on time and ready. So I had the time waiting to think of every worst case scenario that could happen. She will think that I'm being dramatic, she won't believe that I have anxiety, she will tell me that the wait list will be too long and I won't be in until school starts even though I'm trying to get some tools before school starts. Well. The appointment starts, and I KNOW she was just doing her job, but I felt interrogated and that I had to do more than just explain my anxiety, I felt like I had to justify and defend it. I KNOW I was oversensitive because of being nervous and snowballing/worst case scenario freaking before the appointment. I felt like the intake counselor I had last time was much softer, more empathetic and understanding. I felt like this counselor was more like a job interview - like if she doesn't like me, I won't get counseling, even though I have 6 more sessions free with my degree. When it came time to the \"male or female counselor?\" question, I said I didn't care either way, BUT I wanted to make sure that I didn't get a student this time. I talked about it with my psychiatrist last week and he said it's totally within my right to ask for a fully registered psychologist for a counselor. Did I mention this intake counselor was an intern? As soon as I said that, it was like I offended her. She started defending the students and the need for openness with having a student counselor. I said that I understand (I'm a psych student myself hoping to go down that road!!), but I'd feel more comfortable with someone who has more hours under their belt. Then she asked me about interns instead of students. At that point I just basically said whatever and I just wanted to leave. She had to ask me if I was okay with video taping (I did it last time, it's just pointed on the counselor, only my voice is included in the tape). I told her not at this time because I think I'd be more worried about what I was saying than being honest. Well THAT was the wrong answer and she gave me a speech about how it really helps them and it doesn't make it worthwhile to have a client who refuses videotaping. I wanted to cry. Eventually I was able to leave, and I ended up in tears in my car. \n\nNot long after I left, I got a call from my parents saying that my grandparents' home had been broken into. They left for an hour and someone or a group of people had kicked down the door, stole several family heirlooms, my great grandmother's jewelry, the entire Swarovski crystal collection with some passed down from my great grandmother after she passed away. These figurines have HUGE history in our lives. As kids we would pick out our favourites and we would stare at them totally amazed at how beautiful they are. My grandfather's professional camera was taken. His watch. Some cash he had in his drawer. They opened my grandmother's clarinet and left it in pieces on the floor. Just absolutely heartbreaking. I ended up crying again because of my connection to many of the things as I was very close with my great grandmother, but was next in line after my grandmother to receive many of these sentimental pieces. Then I realized that their door was locked, kicked in and everything was gone within the hour that they had left the house. Someone had to have been watching their house. It's now 2:30am and I cannot sleep because I'm terrified that it could happen to me. At least 2 other instances in their area (not far from me) have been reported this week. I have dogs, which is a good thing, but that doesn't stop someone from watching your routine. I'm terrified and panicking.\n\nIf that wasn't enough, on my nightly walk with my two dogs and boyfriend, our newest rescue who had recently just had surgery to remove porcupine quills got loose of my grasp and chased a rabbit. We knew she loved them, but she had never been so aggressive with wanting to chase one before. She chased it all around the field and it was not a \"hey this is a lot of fun!\" chase, it was a \"you look like dinner\" chase. The rabbit lead her across a fairly busy road (keep in mind, it was almost 11pm when we were out and mostly dark except for street lights and she is a dark GSD/Black Lab X), where a car nearly hit her. I was a mess. I had grabbed our other dog's leash from my boyfriend immediately as she started running and he chased after her. Then I ended up kneeling in the grass, completely hyperventilating and crying because I thought I was about to lose my dog. Even now I'm getting really worked up. My boyfriend was able to tackle her finally and everyone is okay, including the bunny. Every time I start thinking about how close I was to losing this silly, amazing dog I feel like I'm going to fall apart. I spend more time with my dogs than I do any other person and they mean the world to me. They are my rocks, they calm me down when I am losing it with hugs, kisses and resting their heads on my lap. I can't imagine losing one.\n\nI'm sorry for the long post, I guess I just needed to rant and beg for empathy. You have all been so wonderful before, I could really use you now.",
