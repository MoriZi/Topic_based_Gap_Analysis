And everything he said was affirmative, thankful...geez, here I go and we probably only talked for like a minute.  But he made an impression.  \n\nThat's what I want to do.  He also just kept talking.  I might never be that chatty.  I'm never going to be exactly like this guy, I know that.  But there were aspects of his character which I admire and I'd like to emulate.  I think because I've been so sad and depressed for so long it's seeped into every aspect of my persona and people can't help but be put off by that.  Nobody really seems to want to be around someone when they're be negative all the time.  But if you're hurting really badly and you don't know how to express it in a healthy manor it only gets worse and the problem exacerbates itself.  But if you can break the cycle by being positive and outgoing (even when you want to be sad or anxious), I think you might get better results. \n\nI won't ever be a social butterfly, and that makes me happy actually.  But I can still be a social being and put my best effort into everything I do.  That's what you have to do...this is going to be hard.  Thanks for reading!  I hope you discover good things about the people around you too that you can make a part of yourself. \n\n",

I see all these people I went to high school with being fearless and enjoying their college years, taking trips abroad, celebrating 21st birthdays, moving forward in their dreams... and here I am, unable to hold down a job, go to school, or even just go to the doctor by myself because of my anxiety.\n\nI don't know why I care so much. I don't even talk to any of my old friends anymore because I let the connections wither and die due to my fear of actually initiating a conversation. On some level I know I'm sick and it's not my fault that I'm not as happy and successful as all of them, but I still feel so ashamed of myself. Like I should just be doing better and it's just because I couldn't hack it.\n\nI don't know why I'm so ashamed of my illness either. Sometimes I wish I had a physical illness rather than a mental one so people could understand better and it wouldn't be such a taboo subject that I'm twenty years old and not taking advantage of the best years of my life or any of that shit. But nobody would ever see it that way. You never get called brave or a fighter when you're mentally ill, because it takes all the bravery and fight out of you. It's always because you, somehow, are weak in character and that's why this is happening to you.\n\nI feel so horrible and unworthy and inferior.",

I immediately start assuming it's some form of cancer or tumor. \n\nAlso those medical problems I talked about. Turns out one of my spinal disks has become misaligned and I have to see a neurosurgeon and get an MRI to see if I need physical therapy or surgery. Now my mind is racing thinking what if I have a tumor there, or in both my head and back?! This in turn is making my head feel worse. \n\nUgh does anyone else do this or get these weird head pressure ache things? I could use some reassurance here ",

I've been down that road, I've thought that I would have to live a total misery for a life. However this is not the case at all. Ive had a massive turn around in my outlook (from negative to positive) towards my condition. I can already feel that things are improving and are only going to get better. \n\nCBT has given me a more helpfull way of analysing everyday situations. Jogging has reduced my baseline anxiety enough so that I can manage my anxiety in situations where it is provoked.

I was not rude or violent. Yet when I woke up at 5 am I was shaking with fear. I do not remember going to sleep and am loosing my mind filling the missing time in my night with worst case scenarios. This is not new to me but the fear and anxiety I have after  a night of drinking makes me legit suicidal. I no it will go away but is there anything I can do to fix it?  What besides asking eveeyone what happend Will make me feel better?",

            "selftext": "I just needed to vent a little before I attempt to not humiliate myself in 8 hours. We have to give our first speech of the semester tomorrow and it isn't looking like it'll end well.\n\nMy social anxiety can be really intense. When I was in high school I literally bolted out of the classroom several times when I'd attempt a presentation. I'm better than that now, and was able to give several presentations in a in a psych class a few semesters ago ***but*** that was because we could simply read our entire speeches or presentations.\n\nI can't do that for this class though; all we get is one page worth of notes we can bring up with us. And when I get in front of a crowd I literally can't think. At all. The only thing I'm able to do is read. I actually couldn't even practice my speech in front of myself. No matter how many times I tried I'd get about 5-10 seconds and totally freeze. And that was with no audience at all! I'm going to be taking copious amounts of Ativan beforehand (more than I've ever taken before) but even that I don't trust will take the edge off enough.\n\nI'll probably have to stop shortly through my speech and say that I can't continue or I'll have a panic attack.  Which will leave me with a horrible horrible grade. Maybe I'll be so drugged up that I'll hardly remember embarrassing myself which would be a small silver lining. I actually took a small amount of Ativan tonight to help me be able to practice my speech but I still wasn't able to do it. It did loosen me up enough to post on here though...\n\nUPDATE: My speech went well! The actually speech wasn't  the best because it was 3-4 speech about myself. I couldn't even get to a lot of my points because I was running out of time. So it seemed a bit disorganized and rushed.\n\nBut I did it with confidence! I stood up and looked around the room and felt 0 nervousness looking at all my classmates. That's the biggest thing my Ativan does, it makes me not anxious about being in front of so many people. I can then get up and speak like I'm having a regular conversation \n\nI got a 65/80 for my grade, so I can't complain too much.",
