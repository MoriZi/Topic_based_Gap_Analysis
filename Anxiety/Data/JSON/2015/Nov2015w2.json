            "selftext": "I never thought medication was for me.\n\nI felt like my anxiety was a character flaw, that I was too weak or not trying hard enough to simply control my own emotions. I didn't feel like I \"had anxiety,\" and in fact I would have felt like an impostor labeling myself as such - because I thought my feelings were stemming from my own weak personality, not a genuine problem in my brain.\n\nEven though all along I fully believed that anxiety *is* a genuine disorder, that people with anxiety didn't choose to have anxiety, and that for some people medication does wonders, I wasn't able to identify as one of those people, and so I never even considered that medication could help me.\n\nThen I went to a psychologist for help with my CSP which was getting out of control (https://www.reddit.com/r/compulsiveskinpicking in case you're interested) and I was put on Zoloft (it's commonly used for OCD and anxiety  as well as depression) to control the CSP and the anxiety that can trigger it.\n\nIt changed my fucking life. I used to have this feeling that I had no personality because I never had much to say to anyone. But now that I don't feel too panicked to think when I talk to people, I realize I actually have a lot to say. I'm able to actually make friends for the first time since age 12 (I'm 18). I went to a party where I only knew one person - not only did I not feel terrible shame and panic, *I had fun*. When I say something awkward to someone, I used to get flashbacks to that where I felt such intense shame and self hatred, but now it doesn't seem like a big deal. When I see strangers I no longer feel like they feel hostile or judgmental to me. Basically, I feel like **Zoloft has opened my eyes to see the world clearly for the first time, and without the anxiety clouding my vision it is a nicer place then I could have imagined.**\n\n**I am not saying that medication is right for everyone. But I am begging you not to automatically write it off as an option *for you*.** Give it real thought. I regret how much enjoyment I missed over the last 5 years just because I never realized meds could help, and I don't want others to miss out in the same way.\n\nEDIT: I know I'm very lucky that the first drug I tried worked so well for me (there were some side effects, but I added Wellbutrin about 2 weeks ago and I think it's helping :D) I also know that a lot of drugs don't work for a lot of people, and some of the potential side effects would make them not worth taking. I hope it doesn't seem like I'm trivializing that. All I mean is, if you choose not to try medication, *make sure its for a good reason.*",

Mine manifests through panic attacks, intrusive thoughts, you name it - with depression added for taste. \n\nEverything from leaving the house to answering a phone to going out with friends causes me anxiety and I'm trying to get a job. I've been unemployed for 3 months due to a total breakdown during my last job. Have tried 6 different SSRIs over the past 10 years and I'm currently trying a SNRI. \n\nWith two interviews lined up over the next 4 days, my road ahead is pretty overwhelming but today I finally went to therapy...I've been putting it off for 10 years and even though I didn't want to do it, I finally went and I'm glad I did. \n\nJust wanted to share. \n",

Generally I live day to day just feeling very 'blah' and flat. I distract from my thoughts by chatting online, reading reddit, playing videogames, taking care of siblings and dog. Then at some random point, something will just set me off. My dad's wife will tell me to clean the table or do the dishes or something, and then my thoughts spiral out of control. I just think, \"I should've done that before she asked. Why haven't I done it yet? My stuff takes up so much space here. I should just live in the attic. I shouldn't even be here. She probably hates me. I'm just a complete waste of space.\" I start wanting to cry, but I have to hold it in and am about 50% successful, if not I just go to my room and cry for hours or something, just feeling so incredibly and intensely *sad*. Not like panicked, though part of the sadness is definitely fear. It's just some emotion so intense I get pain in my chest and belly, and I want to scream or sob but I'm not a very expressive person so it's just like this tight pain and I tense up and shake and then I get a really bad headache after I'm done crying. It just feels weird feeling such intense emotions sometimes that I can't even name because 90% of my life is just so meh, and then something will trigger a 'sadness attack'.\n\nAdmittedly crying is better way of dealing with it than other destructive coping mechanisms I've used to handle anxiety in the past, but I'm just wondering if anyone else has sort of the same thing? They've come and gone since I was a kid, but have been happening more often lately maybe because I've been trying hard to get rid of the harmful coping skills and now idk how to deal.",

I go to the gym now each day (granted three days successfully in a row) and I have a lot of reading, journals and things to make myself better each day. \n\nBut I want to give up. I've been dealing with this for over 20 years off and on. And I'm at my breaking point. I can't take this anymore. I do what I'm supposed to do and then one morning I can wake up feeling good and I can take on the day, then today (carry on from late last night) has been a nightmare.  For some reason I get this in my head that I can't breathe well (despite the fact I have no wheezing, no shortness of breathe, just tension and my sinuses close up totally anxiety induced I believe) and I couldn't get to sleep each time  I was about to drop off I was uncomfortable and my thoughts raced like mad and it felt like I was going to pass away in my sleep. \n\nWoke up today, and this just is just a nightmare. I don't care about life, I'm not feeling effected by anything, nothing is cheering me up, nothing is relief. I am just so exhausted being in a miserable mind that thinks it's dying, has cancer, i going crazy or can't hold it together, and these can all happen at once in seconds).  I told myself I will take this xanax (I either take a .25mg or a .25 and a half of one) before the gym so I can get it done. And luckily I have. But todays Xanax almost made no effect, my mind won't stop, my body wont settle I'm fucking miserable. \n\nI just sit watching the clock go by and hope tomorrow is better.  I am terrified of meds, I have Cipralex still in it's bag waiting for me. And yet each time I'm on here I hear of the side effects from people, how it's made them worse and etc. Or they have to keep trying meds back and forth back and forth.  \n\nI can't even handle 10 mins of this nightmare anymore. I'm just so tired. How can I even try meds if that happens to me. I don't like this anymore. I don't want to die miserable and my last days were a nightmare. \n\nI don't know what to do or how to go on anymore. ",

            "selftext": "Hello everyone, this is my first time visiting this subreddit so I apologize if I do anything against the rules. I'll do my best to fix it if something happens. (Also I'm on mobile, hopefully the formatting is ok.)\nI'll just start off by saying I love video games. For me it's not really an addiction, but more like a fun hobby. I tend to stick to some select games because I don't ever seem to get bored of them (Grand Theft Auto, Red Dead Redemption, Skyrim, Super Mario Sunshine, to name a few.) \nI just started playing Borderlands. I wanted to branch out to FPS games, and my BF recommended it to me. I am absolutely in love with this game! The characters, the skags, the artwork, the mission-based storyline; I'm having a blast (lol) with this game. However, while I'm playing my anxiety builds up until I can't stand it anymore and I have to take a break. I feel exhausted when this happens, so I lie down for a bit and browse reddit until I feel better. Then it's back to the game, and the cycle continues. I have a suspicion that for Borderlands in particular it's something about the \"enemy encounter\" music and also a slight fear of getting surprised by enemies. (As soon as I kill the enemies though, I feel better. Still anxious, but slightly more relaxed than I was when I had a Badass Psycho barreling towards me.)\nThis cycle has happened with my other games, and the anxiety was especially harsh in the beginning. But as I repeatedly played them, my anxiety levels went down, and my breaks were more about resting my eyes than calming myself down. Has anyone else experienced this? I've always believed that games are supposed to be a source of fun and relaxation, but for me it's more like fun and panic. I feel like there's something wrong with me and I wish it wouldn't happen... I just want to play my video games. :(\nTL;DR: Shooting bullets and sweating bullets while using my Xbox. Is it weird to have fun playing a game but go through cycles of anxiety? Advice, stories, or general support is greatly appreciated.",

If I can't understand the example, I look at my notes/textbook chapter. If I can't understand the notes, I look online. If I don't understand the online resources, I look at how much time I wasted trying to find out how to do a single problem. When I do that, I look and see how many problems I have left. When I do that, I think of all the other work I have to do and the sheer amount of time it will take to finish it. When I realize it will take me longer to do something that I want it to, I panic. When I panic, I go into four year old mode (cry, shout, throw things around). When I go into 4 year old mode, I lose all desire to do anything productive (in spite of the sheer amount of work I have to do) for several hours. When I lose all desire to be productive, I try to pity myself, especially if I can even give the slightest amount of blame to something (shitty professor, shitty class). When I do that, I go online looking for a pity party. The cycle continues. I've been trying to get out of it for years, but I can't. I have the bad habit of correlating how much I know how to do something with how quickly I can do it (kind of like a shark, if I don't swim fast enough, I choke). If I can't do something quick enough, I panic. \n\nI don't know what to do at this point. Bitching on reddit isn't going to get anything done. But shit, I just want fucking As so I can have a GPA higher than a 3.4 and actually do something with that useless piece of paper called an Engineering degree. \n\nEDIT: I decided to move on to another homework assignment I had: a MATLAB project.

            "selftext": "So long story short I tried to get help last week because I realized I had become completely non-functioning. It didn't go great and I was feeling hopeless as ever. \n\nI made an appointment with my doctor for this week though, and it was really difficult not to just cancel and stay in bed but I went. And it went so so much better. My doctor is wonderful she is really great at making you feel normal and okay about needing help. \n\nAs it turns out I am suffering from severe depression and anxiety. Fun stuff! I'm trying out medication for the first time in my life and will also be starting group and solo therapy sessions (once the medication starts working my goodness is the thought of talking to more people painful right now). \n\nIt would be inaccurate to say I feel better. My teeth still feel like they are falling out when I even think of opening the front door. That other me is still yelling at me about how much of a piece of shit I am. What changed is I don't feel like there's no point anymore. I was very much ready to give up, and I don't like the prospect of all the painful effort ahead of me, but I do feel like I can try a little longer now. \n\nThanks for the support everyone I hope you all get the help and care you need too",
