I don't want them to be like \"So what do you do for work?\" And have them judge me, like I have been a failure since highschool or am not successful. Even the people who I have been more successful than I don't wish to see. I was just in one of the two supermarkets in town a walmart shopping at 1:30 am to avoid people already and came across a old friend I had in highschool. But we're not friends and we went completely different ways. I immediately turned and hoped he didn't recognize me and left my cart and left the store and drove to the next closest walmart 25 minutes away where there would be less of a chance to run in to someone I know. What's up with this? Anyone similar? The feeling I feel when I see someone is like going on the apex of a roller coaster.

            "selftext": "Sorry for the long post\n\nSummary: Smoked a bale of weed, became socially anxious (among 100 other horrible symptoms), took a semester off from college, will hopefully be able to function when I return. \n\nI went into a tailspin in January. Until that time, my self-image consisted of an intelligent, admittedly awkward, but otherwise standard-issue, gawky white kid. Normal amounts of extroversion, if not a little more than typical. There wasn\u2019t much to indicate my future troubles. I had night terrors when I was little. \n\nI\u2019m not sure exactly what happened to me. Throughout my first semester of college I smoked an exponentially growing amount of weed, drank a little, and studied my ass off. Looking back, I honestly acted a little manic. I really hit the ground running, joining clubs, talking my ass off, meeting people, etc. As time went on I found some great friends and smoked a lot of weed, as much as I could and still make good grades. \n\nI stopped playing frisbee and writing for the school newspaper. I probably knew that my level of fucks given correlated negatively with the amount of weed I was smoking, but I was having a fucking blast. I always smoked with two guys who are some of the highest quality human beings I\u2019ve ever had the fortune to meet. \n\nBy December, every time I got high was miserable. Smoking weed gave me so much anxiety that I was afraid to move or speak. I felt like I was getting much higher than my friends. I definitely couldn\u2019t function while high as well as them. Neurotic thoughts spilled over into my sober time. By the end of the semester I felt like I was losing my mind. I was worried that I would hear voices any day, that my friends would abandon me, that people were looking at me and judging me. I had a couple of panic attacks when I texted my friends and they didn\u2019t text back immediately. Whenever that happened, I would just lay in bed and stare at the wall. I stopped exercising and eating well. I stopped leaving my room, except to smoke with my fellow stoners. \n\nI gritted my teeth and focused on getting through finals. The times that I couldn\u2019t avoid going to the cafeteria were hellish. I didn\u2019t want to sit with people or have them look at me. I was extremely self-conscious. If that sounds cute or manageable at all, you haven\u2019t been anywhere near as self-conscious as I was. It was like all of my thoughts turned inward and negative. I couldn\u2019t think of a single redeeming quality I had. I experimented with cutting myself, but didn\u2019t find any relief from it. \n\nI got through finals by the skin of my teeth. I think I probably drank three pots of coffee a day (or about 12 cups) and smoked every night. \n\nWinter break was tough. I smoked a couple of times and it was absolutely horrible. I quit smoking weed on New Year\u2019s day and couldn\u2019t sleep. When I could, my dreams were incredibly vivid. I went over to an old friend\u2019s house and literally could not understand a board game that his family played at dinner (they were a household of engineers, bless them). I couldn\u2019t speak and play halo at the same time. My friend, who is a great guy but probably isn't as intelligent as I am, started making fun of me saying \u201cumm\u201d so much, then actually got a little annoyed with me. I was terribly worried that I was becoming retarded, that I had accidentally smoked something in the prior semester that had given me brain damage (I didn\u2019t). I had some suicidal thoughts, but they never got very bad. I spent long periods of time in front of mirrors due to a channel of twisted thoughts related to my self-consciousness. \n\nI went back to college for a week. My friends were incredibly supportive when I told them I didn\u2019t want to smoke anymore, but my condition still wasn\u2019t improving. I couldn\u2019t get my thoughts organized enough to buy books from the bookstore or understand my readings. I couldn\u2019t speak to people without feeling as if I was in front of a gun. I couldn\u2019t even walk past people in the hallways without feeling as if I was moving awkwardly. I called my parents and they made the 17 hour drive at, I was told, on average 95 miles an hour because they thought I was going to kill myself. \n\nToday is May 20th, and I have made a lot of progress. I found a psychiatrist that is extremely objective. She prescribed me Paxil (an SSRI antidepressant) in February because some of my symptoms sounded obsessive-compulsive to her, and I agree. It nuked my anxiety and depression, but made me very drowsy and didn\u2019t quite make me feel comfortable around people again, so I recently switched to Lexapro (another SSRI). I\u2019ve written a couple of articles for local magazines and feel as mentally sharp as ever. I\u2019ll go back to school in August and take another swing at it. I haven\u2019t smoked weed except once since January. My goal is to get to where I can feel comfortable hanging out with acquaintances, at minimum. Strangers still spook me. \n\nI shared all of this to let people who are going through similar situations have some perspective and to know that anxiety and depression are very treatable. While December and January were gray, dead months for me, my life is at least worth living now. I think weed is an amazing and excellent drug, but ask your parents what your family\u2019s incidence of mental illness is before you try any drugs. It turns out that most of the adults in my family are fucked up somehow. And if your highs start to become miserable, give it a rest. I\u2019ll never smoke again because I very strongly suspect weed is worse for people with social anxiety than almost anyone else (a theory I developed during long periods of anxiety driven research, sorry but I don\u2019t have links). \n\nIf you have thoughts in response or questions, feel free to PM me, I get on reddit about once a week.

She told me that I should go lay down/get water etc.. but I couldn't stop crying enough to even open my eyes. After a little more of this she literally just said \"well, you can do it. Im going to hang up now\". I felt so scared I tried to keep her on the line but she just hung up. This made me feel so upset. My last resort for when I feel suicidal just left me in the dark. I sat there crying for 30 more minutes before I was able to calm myself down and get up. It felt so awful. I NEVER want to experience that again. Im afraid for the future. Im afraid of life.

            "selftext": "So, the 14th was my birthday and instead of living it up with my closest friends I was stuck at home playing video games with them - which isn't bad or anything to be embarrassed about. The thing is, I go to community college while all my friends (only have a handful besides my girlfriend) go to a good state college. I should be going into my senior year of college but I'm still at approximately sophomore year.\n\nNot to mention I can't ever hold a job because for some reason I just stop going to them after about 4-5 months. I don't know why, I just lose the urge, motive, and/or desire to go to work out of the blue.\n\nAnd this behavior is not just limited to work; school is another issue. It's the same pattern. Go to class first month or two and do well. Get A's and B's on assignments and tests. Then, out of the blue, I lose motivation and skip/slack off and play video games instead or just waste time in general. My lack of discipline, drive, and willpower have been reoccurring themes in my life and I've almost come to accept and welcome them as a normal part of my life. Which is wrong, so very very wrong. As a result of these habits I've become extremely depressed.\n\nOne saving grace is that I may have an attention disorder which explains my spotty attendance and lackadaisical behavior. But when I went to do an assessment the psychiatrist basically told me to go somewhere else and talk to a different person as he would not help me. (A fucking doctor told me this!) So I've been pretty put off of seeking professional help unless someone is willing to PM me and lives in the Northern Virginia area to give me a personal recommendation to a doctor, therapist, or social worker who will hear me out.\n\nIn case you've made it this far and are willing to keep reading: I'll provide some context and background on myself.\n\n* When I was 9 my father got sick and could not work any longer.\n* He passed away when I was 10 1/2.\n\nMy dad was not neglectful or mean, but was always busy so I never got to really talk to or learn who he was. I only have the word of others to paint the picture of who he was (a great man).\n\nAs a result, and due to my brothers having to quit high school and college respectively to work in the family business, I had no proper male figure in my life to help me. No values of hard work, a set schedule, or drive to get things done was instilled in me. Now, it is kind of a cop-out to blame my father's death and refuse to grow up, and I've thought of that plenty of times too but I just can't get out of this funk I've essentially been in for a decade.\n\nI try every year really hard, but I just end up making a mistake and then feeling like the world around me is caving in and everything I've done is all for naught. On the rare occasion when I do own up to my mistakes or fuck ups and try to make things right: I am plagued by severe social anxiety about what my peers, superiors, friends, or even family members will think about me when they find out I've failed and am in the process of fixing my mistakes. \"Oh, he did it again.\" \"Typical throaway1914,he always makes the same mistakes.\" \"What is wrong with him?\"\nI know I have serious issues and problems, and I really want to fix them, I just don't know how and struggle with depression, anxiety, and an addiction to competitive video gaming.\n\nAt least you'd think I'd find solace in being a really good player at this video game, but alas I may be in the 99th percentile of the player base, but I am still not famous, recognized, or even \"that good\" to make a splash into the professional scene. Nor do I want to be known as a pro gamer, it's just a hobby, nothing more. I want to have a life where I can actually benefit others and help them with real, serious issues and problems in their lives - but I can't do that if I can't even finish community college.\n\nI don't even know what I am looking for posting this... But it is sort of relieving to put it all out there even if it is anonymous and no one will likely read this or care too much. Although, if you or someone you know has been through a similar ordeal PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE tell me what steps you took to better yourself or improve your situation. It would mean a lot to hear of someone digging themself into a hole like I have and crawling their way out of it.\n\nTL;DR I have anxiety, a gaming addiction, and depression due to the aftermath of a ruined childhood by my father's passing when I was an adolescent.\n\nI forgot to mention that although my friends and family are aware of my predicament, however I consistently lie or tell them half of the truth about my situation. I don't want them to worry about me, but paradoxically will lie to them and try to do better, but end up making my problems worse, and then in the end they're even more pissed/disappointed because I lied and the end result of my efforts is just a steaming pile of shit.",

Now its more about being sick and not being able to fulfill certain responsibilities because of said sickness. \n\nI was wondering if anyone else had this issue and had any ways of coping? Things I do are, watching when and what I eat, avoiding caffeine, anti nausea medicine(Works wonders) Acid re flux medicine, tums, and cold water.

I've wanted to write this for a long time, but was unsure how, I know those in the throws of anxiety can be triggered by those who have overcome it, but anyway here it goes:\nI've always been uptight, and have experienced mild panic attacks, however 16 months ago my whole life change. Literally in a blink of an eye. I experienced a series of consecutive and debilitating panic attacks that lasted weeks. I was in and out of the hospital, this pattern continued for about a year. I stopped going outside, being a proper mother and wife, I gave up on life, and wanted to die some days. Every day was spent in intense fear, something \"others\" don't understand. Not my friends, my family, or my husband. I couldn't eat or sleep. The one thing I did do was be proactive about getting better. I went to therapy, group therapy and a psychiatrist, I learned DBT and CBT, I practiced yoga, and learned breathing techniques. Most days I believed I would never get better. Do you know what changed it all for me? I began to believe that I was ok, and stopped fearing the fear. It sounds simple, but it was the hardest thing I've ever done. Since then I've landed the best job I could ask for, re-enrolled in a Bachelor's program, and my family moved to another state. This is not to say I am rid of the demon completely, but now it's more of a minor annoyance, one I'm grateful for. Without anxiety I never would have made the conscious decision to change my life and to challenge myself to be better.  I know that sounds crazy, and had the me a year ago read this I would've scoffed, and then gripped my already tight chest, a symptom that is long gone now. \nMy point is, every single one of us has this, we are ok, there is life beyond this out there. Anxiety does not define us. I know, I didn't believe it either at one point. Even when you don't believe in you, remember someone does, I do. ",

I know I shouldn't be tearing myself down, but on bad days it really feels like the most endearing trait is that people feel sorry for me. I feel like such a mess.\n\nI get stuck and can't respond when I have to call someone back or send an email, and an interview pretty much means I won't sleep or feel normal for like that entire day and the day before and after. It won't be just one panic attack but like 2 pretty bad ones and continuous low-level ones. I'm in the process of getting insurance and don't have a healthcare provider right now so meds or therapy aren't an option. Luckily I have a really supportive partner who's been helping me through it, and getting through that terrible interview has helped me get confidence for the next ones. But I've also got that fear that I'll just repeat it again, I'm finding myself avoiding even that location while I'm applying for jobs because I don't want it to happen again.\n\nThe worst part is, despite all of that crap, I know for a fact I can function in a job and do really freaking well. I work hard, I hold myself to really high standards, and I've got nothing but good feedback from people I've actually worked with. I know I can do it, I'm just having a really hard time getting in the door, and I'm trying not to discourage myself.\n\nWhat strategies do you have?",
