I feel guilty that he has a wife with these problems.\n\nI just started taking Wellbutrin and am on day 10 of that (while taking Ativan under my psych's supervision). I really really really hope that it works for me. I cannot emphasize that enough. I have taken Effexor in the past (which worked but I wanted to try to avoid some of the side effects if possible) and gone through DBT therapy and am back talking to my therapist. I'm doing everything I think I can to make it better (it always gets better, but in the slump it feels like it never ever will). I just wish it would HURRY UP and get better faster.\n\nI just guess I needed to get that off my chest. I just want to apologize to him all the time for being this way. He's a good man.

For example, my roommate sucks. I do all the cleaning, she takes up most of the cabinet space, she's extremely loud when I'm trying to study, talks my ear off about her life and never listens to anything I have to say, etc. Most, very simple problems that could be solved by using my words. But I feel like I'm making this stuff up sometimes. Like, yeah she does this stuff, but what if I'm doing something that's much worse and she just hasn't brought it up because she's nice?\n\nFor example, I feel like if I confront her on using too much cabinet space, she'll come back with something that I do that's really annoying, and then I'll feel like an asshole for bringing anything up in the first place. I feel like whenever I confront someone, I'm coming across as \"I'm perfect, and you're awful\".\n\nI know that's a highly dramatic way of looking at it, but I just... I don't know, I don't want to be the bad guy. So instead I passive aggressively complain on Reddit. Ugh! Why can't I just deal with my problems?",

            "selftext": "So for the past 3 weeks or so I have been freaking out and practicing constantly on my double bass.  Not long before I received an email saying that a jazz/rock group wanted me to audition for them, and I also got an email from a local orchestra saying that they wanted an audition too. At first I was super excited, as this was huge for a new bassist like me (only 2 years playing so far)! But then I remembered that I would have to audition, and that meant playing solo pieces in front of people who are judging my every move. Ohhh man, that did not sound like fun. But even though I was scared, I decided to do it. I dedicated the next few weeks to practicing every night.\n\nThen the first audition came for the orchestra. I was so, so nervous. I had my piece, but in my mind it wasn't perfect yet. So I reluctantly dragged myself over and when it was my turn I was sweating so much. As I played my song, my hands shook, so it wasn't that great sounding, but it wasn't terrible either. When I was done I glanced at the people judging me and they just said \"We'll get in touch with you\". Then I shakily left, feeling very disappointed because I wasn't sure what that meant. I assumed I didn't get in. It didn't help that I never received the email, either. I had to write them an email saying \"Excuse me, but did I get in?\" on the night of the first rehearsal because I wasn't sure whether I was supposed to show up or not. Turns out I did get in, they thought they made it obvious, but I guess in my anxiety-ridden mind I didn't notice. I was (and am) so happy! I played at the rehearsal that night and while it was a bit lonely being the only lower-strings player there, it was fun, and I can't wait to go again this week.\n\nThen, only a couple days ago, I had my jazz audition. This one was almost more stressful because I knew that this was pretty much exclusively a university band, and here I was still in high school. Thankfully, the leader of the band was very kind and helped me carry my bass downstairs and was pretty chill throughout the whole audition. When I made a mistake on my second (arco) piece he actually helped me with it. He even said I had great sound! Then he said I should stay because the rehearsal was in a couple minutes so I could see if I liked the repertoire and their style. I stayed, and though the songs were a lot more difficult then I was used to (rhythm-wise, because jazz is weird!) it was nice having a challenge. He told me to take the music home and I'm going back next week, so I guess I made it into this one too!\n\nI'm so happy. I can't believe I only started two years ago yet I've made it so much farther than I ever imagined. My only worry is school work - Practice and playing is going to take up most of my free time, but maybe I can work something out with my teachers. I won't worry too much about it right now (though I totally am). I'm so glad I picked up the double bass as it has helped me meet so many new and awesome people and has helped with my social anxiety so much. Here's to hoping the rest of the year is just as great!",

            "selftext": "The idea of turning in my notice at work has my anxiety through the roof. One of the biggest triggers for my anxiety is feeling like I'm disappointing someone or letting them down by having to give bad news. My anxiety has been even worse than it normally is because I was raped last year and am currently in therapy for it. \n\nIn mid-August, I got a job as a sever and bartender at a small restaurant. On paper, the job was perfect: walking distance from home, good atmosphere, early closing, etc. I've been here over a month and I feel like I'm being taken advantage of by my coworkers, who are all women in their 40's. I'm the only employee in the restaurant without manager privilege (which is fine), but I basically am the whipping girl because they blame things on me and randomly assign me shifts that conflict with my therapy schedule (which I told them about) because they want to take random days odd. I'm fine with having to deal with shit as the new girl, but I've had to miss 3 therapy sessions and another one tomorrow. I'm also making no money because I'm given tiny sections. I'm lucky to make fifty bucks a week. \n\nI applied for a job on a whim and found out that I got it. It pays extremely well and I know the owners, and I'm being offered amazing hours and benefits. At first I thought I'd just work two jobs, but the benefits of staying at the bar are outweighed by the benefits of quitting to focus on the new job. I start the new job in a week and I know I need to give notice. \n\nThe idea of telling my manager, who is extremely intimidating, is making me almost ill with worry. The last time I turned in notice, I practiced talking to my manager for a week.  I quit my last job when a manager threw coffee at me, so no need there. \n\nI understand logically that it should be easy and I just need to get it out there. I'm not stupid, I get that. Knowing that doesn't make me panic any less. I guess I'm looking for help communicating succinctly and professionally (I'm an anxious rambler) and minimizing the panic as much as possible, if that's a thing. ",

            "selftext": "I've had a stressful week and I just need to talk. \n\nIt's mostly been good stress because I have a job interview today for a new position at my company. I've been preparing like a madwoman. \n\nNow this has nudged my anxiety a little, but it's nothing I couldn't manage. \n\nFor all the technical jargon I have panic disorder and agoraphobia. The panic disorder is exacerbated by potential medical issues and thoughts of mortality.  This leads to lots of obsessive thoughts. One in particular is when I drive I sometimes have thoughts about what would happen if I was in an accident and died.  Those thoughts started about 5 years ago and fed into the development of agoraphobia. I can proudly say that I caught that early and I have been managing my anxiety with medication ever since. It feels great to have my life back and my dose is high enough so I can function regularly without the obsessive thoughts but low enough so that it doesn't give me the stereotypical side effects of being a zombie. I still get anxious from time to time and I deal with it in healthy ways. \n\nBut last night. \n\nMy boyfriend was at a meeting and had forgotten some important papers and asked if I could drop them off. I was cat sitting so I had to go out anyway. I agreed. I've never been to the location before and it was dark out. I drove past it and pulled into a parking lot to turn around. \n\nI waited for a couple cars to pass (I had to turn left back out onto the road) and saw a motorcycle approaching. \n\nI can't remember everything clearly and maybe he was speeding, I just remember calculating that I had enough time. \n\nI didn't. \n\nI realized right away and halfway out I slammed on my breaks. He swerved but clipped my front corner and lost his balance. He went about 20 feet and was thrown from the bike.  The collision (for me) was mild and I just lost part of my bumper. There was no whiplash or anything. I was stopped when it happened. \n\nI was out of the car and calling 911 instantly at his side. \n\nHis foot was fucking cocked sideways but he was conscious. People came and helped. It wasn't until I started talking to the police officer that it began to sink in. And I started shaking. When I called my boyfriend I was sobbing. And I cried for hours. \n\nThe guy was okay,  thank God. He was fully protected. Helmet, gloves, leather jacket, pants, etc. I see so many people without helmets. I can't even imagine. His ankle is broken. That's all. I am so relieved.  \n\nIt was determined that I was at fault because my car was in the road, obstructing traffic - for lack of better term. Because he hit me with the side of his bike there was virtually no damage to that so they cannot determine if he was speeding. I will tell you, the skid mark on the road wasn't very long. \n\nMy state has a law where when there is an accident resulting in death or serious injury all parties involved have to submit to a blood draw to make sure everyone was sober. (If he was drunk, apparently I'm still at fault.) \n\nSo off to the hospital I went. By now my boyfriend had shown up and was able to drive me.  I got one of those nifty puke bags in the er. And I still have it by my side because my stomach still hasn't settled. \n\nI gave the blood but was floored that they didn't want to know any medical history (like current medications) remember the panic disorder. I felt an anxiety attack coming on because when the doctor rolled up the cart I was dizzy. But I managed because I find that projecting my feelings like that to be embarrassing. And I had already been seen sobbing by so many people.  So I breathed and the anxiety passed. \n\nI went home with a migraine and my boyfriend and I cried and were relieved that I was okay. He tucked me into bed and I passed out pretty quickly. \n\nI woke up at 2:30. It's 5am. I can't sleep. \n\nThings are bothering me. \n\nHis name is John, he's 40 and married.  I (dumbly) asked him if he was okay when I first crouched next to him. He snapped no. Duh, I should have asked any other question. \n\nI never got to apologize to John.  Insurance takes care of all the dirty work so well never see each other. It's so odd how people come into each other's lives so briefly and that's it. I feel like there should have been more but I didn't think it was appropriate to try and reach out once everything was all said and done. I had a long day, John had a longer one.  So, John I can't even begin to express how sorry I am.  I hope you can find it in your heart to forgive. I hope you recover quickly and I hope you are not afraid to get back on your bike. \n\nI know I'm afraid to get into my car. \n\nI was scared when my boyfriend drove. \n\nAnd in a few hours I have to go sit in an office and pretend that everything is stellar and wow the managers. \n\nI only live five minutes from work but I know that it's going to feel a lot longer than that. \n\nHow do I move forward?  If my driving anxiety becomes as bad as it used to be again what can I do to help nip it in the bud?  My panic disorder makes taking strong sedatives a challenge because I panic over the side effects. \n\nAny advice on moving past a traumatic event when you suffer from anxiety?\n\nThanks for reading. \n\nEDIT: thank you all for the amazing support and advice. I will be replying to each of you as I can. I've been pretty drained the past couple days but I'm doing a lot better.  I nailed my interview (I had to interview with 4 different managers). I should know about the job in a couple weeks. The drive to work was fine.  Since I had been up all night and the interview lasted 2 1/2 hours I crashed when I got home.  Yesterday I tracked down my license plate. The body shop that picked it up was 20min away. I had to get it or get one reissued since my state is a 2 plate state. That drive was a little nerve wracking. I tried to get out of it by my boyfriend and friends were working and I didn't want to risk the plate getting tossed.  Also I owed it to myself to go.  I think I was mostly anxious because the driving was accident related and not so much that I was driving. \n\nMy dad has graciously offered to deal with our insurance company for me so I don't have to go through that stress. I think the police also sent info to them as well. I gave the officer my insurance card. I am still on my fathers insurance (I'm 25, were holding off as long as we can to keep rates down) and the car is still legally his but I'm the primary driver. So hopefully when it comes to that mess all I'll have to do is pay my deductible and watch my rates go up again. It's funny because like 3 days before the accident I was talking about the last time my rates went up. It was in 2009 that I got busted with transportation of alcohol by a minor. I was saying how it's almost been long enough that it should no longer affect my rates/driving record/employment/etc and then this happened. Ha. \n\nSo my silence has not been anything serious, I've just be exhausted. I will reply to you all over the next few days. Thanks so much for your love and support. I love you all!",
