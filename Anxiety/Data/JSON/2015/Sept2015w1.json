Little did I know that this had a significant effect on my recovery process and ultimately threw me into a vicious cycle.\n\nLast month I decided to cut out sugar except for the occasional snack. I stopped drinking soda entirely and now even a cup of it makes me feel like poop. I cut back my coffee intake to a single cup (6 oz. glass) a day with dairy creamer and no sweeteners.\n\nI feel so much better. Unless you do this there really is no way to tell how you would actually feel when you do it. I would recommend you do so. Without a proper amount of water your body isn't functioning how it's supposed to. Sugar changes your bodily functions and in large amounts can have very negative effects on you. Without it I've felt happier than I did with it. My anxiety has gone mostly unnoticed which is a huge improvement.\n\nI'm not saying drop all sugar or drink nothing but water. But what I am saying is give it a shot.\n\nThis may sound elementary, but this is the one thing I would recommend you do take to heart.",

            "selftext": "I used to come here all the time and I had so much anxiety that I couldn't even read the posts because they made me feel worse. I never really saw too many people post in here that said that something good came out of having anxiety. Last year around this time anxiety hit me like a ton of bricks so bad in fact that like many of you I didn't want to leave my house. I've always had some form of anxiety but just over night it seemed like it overtook me I had so many fears that I didn't have before and didn't know how to explain it to my family. \n\nFrom one day feeling completely normal to the next day feeling like I'm a different person was the most terrifying aspect of this. I couldn't sleep because my anxiety was so bad I in fact would stay awake for days on end. I still went to work everyday but I just barely made it. The second I would get home I would get back into bed while worrying about what the next day held. I gave up all hope on returning to a normal life. I couldn't go out on the weekends unless I got drunk and my wife had to basically drive me everywhere. \n\nI finally went to the Dr and got some medication. As most of you know getting on medication does in fact make your anxiety worse (for awhile) but after a month or two things got better. It was all baby steps I started driving myself, I actually wanted to go out and meet friends again. Eventually, I even booked a vacation out of the country and I had an absolute blast. I'm not scared to go to work and I even picked up old hobbies. I'm running a half marathon next week I never thought I would be able to do that again. \n\nI've been going to therapy and it's really helped me a lot and I know it's unpopular to say on reddit but I started praying I wasn't sure what to but it does calm me and make me feel better. Fact is, I just hope this helps one person that's struggling. You can get your life back and you can make things better just trust the process. Basically don't worry about tomorrow just focus on today. \n\nTL;DR I never thought I would live a normal life and through medication and hard work I came out on top. Things will get better just never give up. ",

Can't believe it took 4 years of doctor's visits before someone finally tested my thyroid. It's treatable.

I hear the missed text beep and I check just to stop it from continuing to beep. It was just a Verizon message. But after I looked at the inbox and see that there are messages from my Mom to him after he passed saying how she loves him and misses him and still wishes he were here.

            "selftext": "This is probably the first time I have ever opened up like this online, but I feel I have to do it. \n\nI'm going to make it as short as possible to get to the point;\n\nI've had 2 major heart surgeries in my life. One when I was 3 months old, and one just a few years ago (When MJ died) where I had to get a mechanical heart valve.\nNow I'm permanently on warfarin, a blood thinning medicine. I have to take blood samples regularely with my own machine + the hospital to check if the values evens out. \n\n\n\nI have a much higher risk of inner bleeding because of these medications as well. Sometimes when my blood value is too high, I can get a nosebleed from tilting my head. I also have aspergers syndrome (a mild version) ADD, and alot of anxiety. I also have PTSD that makes me go into another dimension of reality when it gets triggered. (This PTSD can get triggered by a certain light that reminds me of waking up from my last surgery. It's images that uncontrolably flashes in my head and idk if they are memories or dreams.)\n\nI'm also super dependant on my mom. She has always been there for me fixing literally everything cause I'm not that capable of taking care of myself with making phone calls to hospitals and such. I'm 23 years old.\n\n\n\n-The point--\n\n\n\n\nSo, last time I was at my annual heart checkup my doctor said they suddently had to preform a new type of checkup. Turns out I have a small leak in my heart valve again. And if that leak grows out of control I will need to have another major heart surgery, which might literally be the death of me. My heart and chest also hurts randomly several times a week, and everytime I ask the doctors about it they say its normal and nothing dangerous. I don't think having chest/heart pains that regularely is normal at all. The new checkup they are going to do, is putting a tube down my throat to get better images of my heart valve. This procedure has never been needed before so it makes me really nervous. They won't tell me anything either if they suspect something bad.\n\nMe and my mom had a talk in the car the other day about me dying if I have another surgery. The talk was short and she just said \"that's something I chose to not think about\" and it got to me really bad. We usually mock death and laugh at anything so I was really afraid when things got that serious. I'm actually crying right now just thinking about it. Suddently I had the thought \"what if my mom dies right now, or tomorrow or the day after, I'll become completely crippled and I won't be able to take care of myself anymore\". Me and my mom are really close, so I dread the day the inevitable happens. She has chronic migraine and intense fatigue. She needs to take several pills and medication everyday to get through the pain. It also worries me. \n\nAnyways, my mom just called me and said she'll call my main doctor and ask about the new procedure and if they suspect anything. I'll get an answer hopefully by the day to calm myself a bit. \n\n\n\n\n\nAbout the anxiety;\n\n\nI worry alot. Too much for my own good. I worry so much that I think I can summon fake pains and other symtoms because I manipulate my brain into thinking I'm more ill than I already am. I worry about worrying as well. And if I actually get a hold of these thoughts and shove them away, another thought invade my head. \"What if the pains are real this time, and you're overseeing them? What if your intestines explode or your heart bursts ?\" really over the top thoughts like those. Every day. \n\nIt's not better during the night either. I have weird stomach \"pains\". It feels like something is moving in my stomach. Sometimes it feels like something is exploding from within, and I feel a warm shock go straight to my head. \nMy pulse accelerates when I try sleeping on the right side of my body, but calms down on the left. I have no idea why. \n\nIf I'm having a good day, the anxiety can come back at any moment. \"What if...\" is what it says. All the time. \n\n\"What if...\"\n\nI died?\nMy mom dies?\nMy dog dies?\nMy heart explodes?\nMy organs stop working?\nMy heart can't go back to normal?\nThe leak is growing?\nMy medication suddently stops getting produced?\nThe doctors are holding back information to spare me?\nI never get to achieve anything?\nNever get to grow old?\n\n\n\n\n\nThat's another feeling I have. The weird sense of that I never will get to the age of 40 +. It's like I have \"psychic senses\" that tells me I'll never get old because of my heart. My mom said she had the same thoughts. But then it just keeps going. What if I'll never be 50, 60 70? And I'll keep thinking that untill I actually die, and I had lived far more than I originally thought. \n\nThese thoughts, feelings, weird pains is what I go through every single day. I haven't had one day where everything was alright in probably 6-7 years. There is always one tiny thing that fucks it up, so the thoughts come back. \n\n\n\n\nI'm thinking about getting help, since I don't want to be on more medication. I also have a mutated gene that causes me to have more side effects on medicine. This happened when I tried out medication for my ADD. I waited almost a year top get it, just to be disappointed because my warfarin went nuts when I took the ADD pills. My blood value went over the roof and I had to stabilize my doseage all the time. So I had to quit it. I also became fatigued and lazy from those pills, lying braindead on the couch.\n\nSo anxiety medicine is out of the question. \n\nI have no idea what's going to happen next. I wonder what the doctor will say about the new procedure. If they don't suspect anything bad it might make me feel alot better. If they just told me 6 months ago I wouldn't feel so terrible. I have enough anxiety and worrying as it is on a regular basis...\n\n\nThe death anxiety has become so cripling that I can barely do the things I love anymore. I can't focus enough to draw, to eat, to clean my apartment etc...\n\nThis post kinda went everywhere but I absolutely needed to get it out. I somehow feel abit better. \n\nThank you for reading. \n",

            "selftext": "I'm not sure if this question has been asked before...I did a quick search and found some threads about the PASSAGE of time and not meeting certain goals/expectations, but my issue doesn't really fit that type of anxiety. \n\nSo, one of my worst anxiety triggers (if not THE absolute worst) is related to time. Now, I have both GAD and OCD, so I'm not sure which one is responsible for this one...it's probably a combination of both. \n\nAnyway, I am absolutely obsessed with getting places on time. Even if there's no definite time I have to be somewhere (like going to the county fair for the day or something), I kind of make up a time in my head and get more and more frantic if I haven't left by that time. My work allows for a flexible schedule, but I never deviate from getting there around 7/7:15 because if I do, it feels \"wrong\" to me and just ruins my entire day. \n\nWhen I find myself in a situation where I might be late to something, I get so much panic. This triggers the worst physical symptoms of anything else that makes me anxious. I get such an upset stomach and racing heart, and I honestly feel like I'm dying. \n\nNow, the biggest issue that I have with this is that I'm married to someone who is by nature an overall laidback, late type of person. Not only that, but she also has several chronic illnesses/autoimmune disorders where her sicknesses will delay her significantly because she is having bathroom difficulties, joint pain, or other related issues. \n\nI am trying really hard to work on this issue in therapy. It causes the biggest strain on our relationship because we inevitably have an argument when we have to be somewhere at a certain time...I keep obsessively looking at the clock, then I start nagging, then she feels like I'm controlling her, then we have an argument that delays us leaving even more. And I feel like the biggest jerk ever because a lot of the time, she CAN'T control her body making her late to stuff. \n\nSo, yeah, I am doing my best to work on this...but even if I don't outwardly nag my wife or cause a fight about this, how can I stop my HORRIBLE feelings on the inside? I have a lot of advice I tend to give anxious people, things that I find help me with most of my anxiety (in particular, spending time with pets or playing music), but even doing those things doesn't really make me feel better with this time issue. \n\nCan anyone relate or help? Like I said, I am really trying to change, but I've been backsliding a LOT the past few weeks for some reason, and it's putting strain on my relationship. ",

I see two or three options that look good, and I get nervous because I can't decide which one I want to order. I usually take a very long time, flipping back and forth and carefully weighing the pros and cons of each option, while my brain goes dark and I start to feel like I'm taking a timed calculus exam. I freeze up and my eyes go out of focus. When the waiter arrives, I decide to just go with any one of the three choices I was originally considering, completely at random. After he leaves, things like *\"Shit, I should've ordered that other thing\"* and *\"Dammit, this isn't going to taste as good\"* are followed by *\"Wow, my life sucks. I'm such a childish loser. I can't make my own fucking decisions. I'm going to waste this money on something I'm not even going to like\"* in my mind. The way I think about these things, it's like I'd just signed an irreversible contract to kill one hundred million people.\n\nI feel like this about almost everything - choosing a university, choosing a future career, choosing a hairstyle, just EVERYTHING. Hell, it took me an hour to type this post because I wasn't sure which words to choose. I wish I didn't have to make choices - I wish I could just try everything at once. The realization that if I choose A, I'll be missing out on the wonderful aspects of B, and if I choose B, I won't get to experience A is just so mentally and emotionally crippling.\n\nThanks for reading.

            "selftext": "I'm not feeling very well physically today. Weird, sharp headaches, nausea, fatigue. I feel this way every month. It happens about a week before my period and a couple days before my period. It happens every month like clockwork. I identified in therapy that it is anxiety because I become very agoraphobic and restless. I quit the last job I had after only working two days largely because I simply couldn't leave the house. I felt physically yucky and super inadequate/worthless/fearful. I also experience a lot of dread. Im feeling the same way today, and I'm tired of feeling this way every month. Birth control has helped some, but no doctor I've seen (which has been many, many doctors/physiatrists) will put me on anything that helps. I'm just wondering if anyone else goes through anything similar, or if anyone has any words of encouragement. \n\nTL;DR I feel like absolute crap the week before my period and experience debilitating levels of anxiety. Anyone else? Any pep talks?",

The farther i get from home, the better i get. When i go downtown into the city, i feel fine, and am able to function normally around large crowds of people.\n\n\nIf i am alone around another person back at home, i freak out a bit. Being around some people give me tremendous anxiety, and some none at all. I am a very social person, and still love to socialize. It's like i have a strong desire to be around other people even though i have anxiety.\n\n\nThis all occurred after some trauma that happened to me, so i don't know if it's more along the lines of ptsd. I'm going to seek a therapist soon. This is also the weirdest thing. At my job at a museum, i have to stand in front of HUGE crowds of people, and scream directions at them. I am the center of attention and must help many different types of people. I feel SO comfortable doing this job. I don't understand. \n\n\nI get freaked out just walking down the street where i live sometimes, but being in front of those people is probably the most comfortable and freeing activity i do in my life. I'm not even this relaxed being at home. Anyone experience anything like this?",
