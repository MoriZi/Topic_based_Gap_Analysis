I graduated from college/university a year and a half ago but was not even able to look for work since.  \nFor the past a year and a half, every morning I would get out of the house, get the paper and highlight interesting job offers; But when I wanted to dial the number, I couldn't.  \nIt was physically impossible, my heart rate would increase, I would start sweating, my throat would go dry and pressing the damn button seemed like the most impossible thing on earth, eventually I would give up and go back home to bury myself in video games and porn.  \nUnemployment made me miserable, made me hate myself, made me suicidal; I cut off contact with family and the only two friends that I had, because I was ashamed and embarrassed. I felt like the most disgusting creature in the world. 24 years of living off my dad's money without even earning a single penny.  \nBut today I finally did it, I started dialing and didn't allow myself to stop, I called and got the address, and much to my own surprise I actually went there. My legs were shaking, my hands were cold and I introduced myself with some hilarious phrasing; But at the end, I got it!  \nYes it's not a fancy job and yes it doesn't pay much but who cares? It's a fucking job!!  \nIf you happen to be in a similar situation, I hope you'll find the strength to step into the uncharted territory too. Trust me, it feels good.",

So if you're dealing with something bigger than this then please just ignore my post.\n\nI want to know: DAE find that they have trouble taking risks or making new steps at work? Do you worry about your ability? Maybe you even avoid doing things you're reasonably sure you could do (like going back into academia or going freelance or taking a lower salary) because your life would be more stressful?\n\nPersonally I have been in my job five years, I am well able to do it, had promotions, but struggle to take the next step. I find interview paralysingly stressful (as I'm sure some other redditors here too), so I haven't moved on. I can't go freelance - I couldn't deal with financial instability. And I couldn't go back to academia because I feel like I would be stressed and miserable. \n\nI'm sorry to be so negative! On the plus side I have done something recommended elsewhere in the forum - listed my possible next steps in a list from easiest to hardest - and hope to start progressing through the steps this year.\n\nBut if you have any more tips about this, I would love to collect them here.",

I'm moving at a snail's pace at the moment, but moving none the less. I can see myself living on my own, and I want freedom so badly. So, I'm working on it, and I'm really proud of myself.\n\nCurrently, I'm seeing a really rad guy I've been slobbering over for years. He knows about my anxiety, and he suffers from anxiety as well. He has helped me through some really rough times simply by being there. Crying in his arms is the safest feeling I've ever experienced. Laughing with him is the best laughter I've ever experienced. For a while he wouldn't talk to me about his feelings, and I understand why he was doing this, and continues to do this. Some people are just private. They keep personal feelings on the inside, whether it's anxiety, depression, or a dissociative disorder. I can respect that and give him his space. All I need to know is whether or not I am his person. He doesn't have to call me his girlfriend, or go out of his comfort zone, i just need to know he's committed to what we have together, right now. I have what I call \"spiraling anxiety\", where I take some event or comment and blow it WAY out of proportion by over analyzing it until I'm frantic with worry. My SO's refusal to TELL me we are exclusive was killing me. I felt like he was using me. Well, this past weekend he told me I was his person. He SAID it!!! Now I can carry on with my day like a normal person. I'm not worried about where we're going, or even where I'm going. I feel like I have a partner now, and it feels so damn good. \n\nI just needed to share this. I'm moving forward, working on my insecurities, and learning to live around my anxiety by working on one issue at a time. My anxiety will never go away, but if I can isolate the triggers, find out what's making me miserable, and then fix it, I'm making progress. I will not let anxiety control me, I will control my anxiety! \n\nEdit: Thank you all, for the upvotes and support! The r/anxiety community has always been there for me, and in turn I'm there for others. I appreciate all of you. ",

Silence? Laughter? A smile? What was that supposed to really mean? What are they thinking about me?\n\nThen the incident is branded into my memory. I will torture myself by replaying it over and over while audibly, verbally abusing myself. For what ever reason, I replay these incidents in the while in shower more than anywhere else.

At the worst points, I do end up cutting or burning myself to try and make the embarrassing incidents stop playing in my head. I don't ever really forget them, but they do get to the point where they stop torturing me for a few days or weeks. Then it all starts over.\n\nHow do I stop this?

            "selftext": "Short background: I am a first-year graduate student in a competitive, professional program. I am also a research assistant within my department and am technically employed by my state government. Throwaway for obvious reasons. I have posted here and in the chat before about my grad school issues so someone might recognize me for that, but oh well.\n\nYesterday, I yelled at my project supervisor during a meeting. \n\nI was doing a presentation on the work I have been doing this semester, and at the end, she said that it was a \"disappointing presentation\", even though I had presented everything she asked for (or so I thought). Also present at this meeting were 3-4 of my peers and my department advisors. I was obviously upset but I stood there and took the criticism for what I thought was a decent presentation.\n\nMy project supervisor mentioned several times during this criticism session that I \"never submitted a final draft\" of my work, that she \"never received a final draft\". Over and over again she said, in front of my peers and superiors, that I didn't do my work. Finally, I had enough, and I clarified that I had, in fact, submitted a final draft of my work last week. I was in her office and she asked me to email her a draft of my work, and I did. Never heard anything back from her until yesterday's meeting.\n\nWe got into a back-and-forth argument over whether or not I had submitted my final draft. She kept saying that she had to \"solicit\" my final draft from me, that other people on the project had approached her with printed out copies of their work. I think she meant that she emailed me asking me for my draft, which I emailed back to her. \n\nMy project was 60+ pages long, I wasn't about to print it all out in the office, and I was under the impression that emailing it to her was fine-- considering that she had verbally and via email told me that this is what she wanted.\n\nFinally, my department advisor put an end to what had become a shouting match and carried on with the meeting. I was supremely embarrassed and had to choke back tears. \n\nLater in the day, my department advisor called me into her office and talked to me about what had happened. She said that both she and my project supervisor (the one I was yelling at) had noticed that ever since January, I seemed disinterested and was having trouble getting work in on time. I'm also behind on work hours. The list went on and on. She said that she \"doesn't like surprises\" and that if there was a problem, I should have come to her about it.\n\nThat's when I broke down. I started hysterically crying. I told her everything: how I've felt alone since I started school, how I started medication but had since stopped taking it because it wasn't helping, how I was falling behind with my work but that I still wanted to be in the program. She let me calm down in her office for a little while, and then she told me that I had to call the campus counseling office right there and then, unless I would be asked to leave my position. My anxiety and depression issues were causing problems, as evidenced by my lack of preparation and my outburst in the meeting that morning.\n\nSo I called the counseling office. I have an appointment tomorrow afternoon. Next week, I am sitting down with my department advisor and we are going to work out the rest of the semester. I am so scared/nervous/embarrassed/upset/you name it, I feel it. I still need to reo-do my final draft and re-do the presentation so I am trying to just focus on that but I feel like I can never face my advisor, my supervisor, or anyone else in my department ever again.",

            "selftext": "Hey everyone! I've posted a few times on this sub but mostly I've just been a lurker. But recently went to my psychologist and he gave me the right diagnosis and medicine that actually works with my body and I honestly can't remember the last time I was this carefree and happy. \n\nI've suffered from really bad anxiety for the past few years. I had a boyfriend, fell in love, got left for another girl, lost my job, and felt like I was burdening everyone with my existence. I was always over thinking things; things had deeper meanings than what they really *were*. And I'd drive myself absolutely insane. One minute, I'd be perfectly fine and then something as tiny as a friend not texting me back would lead me on a roller coaster of emotions, most of the time downhill. And I would always assume I was unwanted.\n\nMy life had turned to complete shit. I couldn't get a job because I would have anxiety attacks, hanging out with friends was always a chore because I had assumed they hated me so much, that everything was said to me in vain and I would **always** take things so offensively. \n\nA few months ago, I started seeing a psychologist. I told him my troubles of anxiety and we went through my vast history of anti-depressants and anxiety medications. I've taken Welbutrin, Prozac, Effexor, Xanax, Ativan and a bunch of other medicines I can't remember the name of. I had quit taking every one of them because I always ended up feeling **numb**, like I couldn't even enjoy life anymore. I would sit and stare off into space for hours just not feeling a thing. It was even worse than what I was feeling before. I was starting to feel discouraged and I thought I had to live the rest of my life with anxiety. \n\nThis is where things finally start to get better. I told him how everything I had taken wasn't working for me; even the ones he prescribed me. Then he told me about this mouth swab test that can test your DNA and tell you what kind of medications will work for you based on your levels of serotonin or whatever. I don't remember exactly what he said, I'm not a doctor. Anyways, I took the mouth swab test and came back 2 weeks later to discuss my medications and how I was doing. \n\nI told him about how I have mood swings and the littlest things could send me into a deep depression, and he said that I might be bipolar along with having anxiety and I should try a mood stabilizer. He gave me a medicine called Lamictal and holy shit you guys. It fucking worked.\n\nToday was my first day of taking it and I feel like I felt when I was a kid. You know that feeling that you get when you first fall in love and everything is perfect and you're still in the honeymoon phase and *nothing* can bring you down? Yeah, that's how I feel. Like a vacation from my anxiety! I didn't realize that my mood swings were actually the primary cause of my anxiety! I've had a clear head all day. I did things that would cause me to have a panic attack but I've been perfectly calm and handled myself pretty well in all tricky situations today! \n\nI'm not a huge poster on here, but I can't thank you guys enough for being supportive when I did need you, and for helping me come to my diagnosis as bipolar/anxiety. \n\nI guess there are a few bits of advice I have: \n\n**1)** Keep a journal handy at all times. Write down any feelings you have and make sure to mark it with dates and exact times of those feelings. It's extremely important to keep track of your feelings so you can go back and later asses them.\n\n**2)** If you are lucky enough to have a psychologist, please use that to your advantage. I was an idiot for a long time and never told my therapists or psychologists the full truth because I was afraid of them judging me. Remember they are not there to judge you. They literally entered the business because they want to help you be the best you that you can be!\n\n**3)* Also, if you have a psychologist, ask them about the mouth swab test! I'm not sure how common they are, he said it was fairly new but he's got nothing but good reviews from this method. Look around your area and find a psychologist who can do this for you.\n\n**4)** Make sure you have the right diagnosis. I'm not a doctor, but I've been misdiagnosed a bunch of times. This is why it's important for you to keep a journal. A lot of times, anxiety can be triggered by other emotions, so make sure you know what exactly is causing them.\n\n**5)** Lastly, please do not give up hope. I know anxiety is such a hard thing to have. Sometimes you can feel hopeless and engulfed in an endless sea of despair and sadness. I know how shitty it is. I thought I was a hopeless case but I kept trying because I knew I deserved more than a life like that. And so do you. If I can find happiness, I have no doubt that you can, too :)\n\n\n**EDIT:** OHMYGOSH you guys I forgot another thing that helped me a lot! [this](http://www.amazon.com/The-Secret-Rhonda-Byrne/dp/1582701709) book has been amazing in terms of positive affirmation. Not only was this one of the key things that got me out of my anxiety but it has brought me so much happiness because it made me believe in myself. Which is hard to do when you're always second guessing yourself. If you only read one book this year, please read this book. You will not be sorry!",

            "selftext": "Hello friends.  I've been having a super rough month or so and desperately needed someone to talk to the other day that understood what I was dealing with- I didn't talk to anyone.  I know, there is this subreddit, and there's also the chat room, but a lot of people don't get responses to their questions on the subreddit, and it's not always easy to get to the chat room.  \n\nMy idea is to create an app where people can get a hold of someone to talk to within minutes.  Here's how it would work:  You would download the app and create a username (standard stuff).  Afterwords, you would create a profile telling a little bit about yourself.  Lastly, you would indicate if you were available to talk (voice over the phone), or text in the event someone needed you.  Ideally the voice call would take place within the app to secure the privacy of your phone number, but you could give it out to whomever you were talking to if you desire.  \n\nHere's a hypothetical situation to give you a better idea:  My wife and kid are out of the town, and I'm freaking out about some random health situation (I think I have cancer, or I'm having a stroke, or possibly a heart attack).  All I need is someone to talk to and tell me it will be alright and help me cope with it.  I open up my app on my phone and change my status from \"green (available to talk to someone) to either \"yellow (need someone to talk to, but not in any hurry), or to \"red (I need to get someone on the horn right now or I'm gonna lose my shit).  So I changed it to red.  Now, all the users that had selected that they were available to talk will get a notification, one by one, and whoever accepts it first will have the honor of helping someone get through a stressful time.  Let's say I set my status to yellow.  People that are logged on to the app will see that my status is yellow and that I'd like to talk to someone, but it's no rush.  They can choose to accept it-or not.  If no one has accepted it in a user-defined amount of time (maybe the person who needed help selected \"yellow- 1 hour\") then it will be processed through the same notification system as \"red\".  \n\nObviously this is bare-bones and needs fleshed out a little more, but it's an idea.  This would be free to anyone to use also.  No need to charge people to talk to friends.  Obviously some sort of ad system would have to be integrated in to keep it functional, though.  \n\nI'd like some feedback from you all.  Does it sound like a good idea?  I'm not by any means an app developer or programmer, so if this is popular I would have to go to a 3rd party to develop this.\n\nLastly, my feelings won't get hurt if you tell me it's stupid.  But I know for people like us, it's nice to have someone in your pocket that you can reach out to at any time, and I also know that while we may have our issue, we never hesitate look after our own when they are in need.  Thanks for reading.\n\nEDIT:  Cake Day! Woo!\n",

Only a month of being in the same state, catching up with my brother only a third time I end up walking out only a few hours into the evening. On my birthday no less.\n\nI've never felt especially comfortable about my birthday and all the attention felt so overwhelming. Then feeling so out of place because I'm so removed from what goes on in their lives. It all got too much and I just walked out and found myself at a train station holding back tears whilst waiting for the train home. All I offered in text was an \"I'm feeling a bit out of sorts\".\n\nI'm so looking forward to living back home again by the end if this year. But I've never felt so out of place and alien in my life and they're my closest and dearest family. I handled being deployed overseas better for fuck sake.",

            "selftext": "After months of contemplating getting help.. Wednesday I actually looked forward to finally having that conversation with my doctor about my anxiety and panic attacks. I meditated before I left and my mom drove me. For the first time in months I didn't feel anxious in the car, we actually went out of my comfort/safe zone. The appointment went great, my doctor prescribed me some meds to try and we headed back home. I was supposed to stop at the pharmacy and go back to the office get my shot. When we were heading towards our exit it started pouring, my mom could barely see our exit. We hydroplaned and slammed into a big truck in front of us. For the next hour it was a horrible dream and the worst panic attack I couldn't pull myself out of. My ears were ringing and I got out to pull my mom out but she was unconscious. Someone pulled over and helped my mom while I called for help. \n\nMy mom ended up being taken to the hospital in the icu and I refused treatment and my brother brought me home. The accident was just a couple minutes away from our house. I spent the next several hours in the bathroom dry heaving, shaking and weak. Took forever for the shock to wear off. I've never been in an accident before. I still don't feel right, me entire body aches. Or that I'm here. Most of the impact was on my side and I don't understand how I wasn't injured and how I walked away from it. \n\nI don't know where to go from here. I woke up last night hyperventilating thinking I was still in the car. I can still smell the smoke and dust from the air bags. ",

            "selftext": "Throwaway because I could get into actual trouble if this traced back to me. Half a year ago I was fired from my job because of what started with a lack of understanding for my insomnia. This had led to some incidents and their solution was to monitor me. Not just my work but my every word and move, and I was unaware of this happening for most of the time. I don't know what got into me but somehow what started as giving myself breathers during the day turned into compulsively browsing the internet on non-work related subjects until I did the minimum amount of work needed. When in the final months of the job I was made aware of this (I had a hunch people might know) I did a desperate effort to correct but the damage was done. The thing is, I wanted to change. I was already in therapy due to past history of depression before I went to work there. It was my therapist who had suggested to take breaks. She eventually suggested I change jobs but I didn't find anything before I got fired. \n\nI have not told my therapist how out of hand this had gotten. I focussed more on the initial months where I worked my butt off to go far beyond expectations but they kept throwing the presentation thing at me. During my first performance interview, when I was still working my butt off, I was told I do not share enough personal information and seem unwilling to be part of the group. I think that is kind of where I started to go \"fuck this\" but I felt I had no other option. I eventually felt they somewhat deserved I was a shitty employee because they kept personally blaming me for essentially who I am (being an introvert is seen as a flaw). \n\nAnyway, I had three months severance pay. I spent that time twiddling my thumbs / recovering from this nasty experience. But we are March now and I have not made a serious effort to find a new job. I however tell my therapist I am doing that. I tell everyone else around me I am doing that. I basically live in a constant lie because I feel if I don't do that then I get questioned on why not. Even my aunt, who is a therapist (not mine obviously), seems to feel I just need to 'keep working hard'. I find there is no understanding even from her if I can't do that. \n\nI'm just so torn and frustrated about this. Why am I such a horrible person? Why would I do all this? Why can't I seem to get started on making this right? I would start job searching in February after I got approved for unemployment pay. I'd start in March. I now keep thinking I've run out of pretty much every other excuse I had and should really start but I don't. Because I need to wait until I've finally been to the dentist which I put off for years. I'll do it after I have decluttered my home. I'll do it once I have finished the free course I can take because I am uneployed. And so on. And meanwhile I keep on living in the lie I created for myself.\n\nI used to be a hard working person, someone who was dependable and strived for the best. Somehow that has become warped into a twisted caricature of someone who won't do things unless they can be done perfectly, who avoids even the littlest challenge and basically wants everything to go her way. Funny enough I bite off more than I can chew and set myself up for failure by taking on big projects and responsibilities in other areas of life and then worry endlessly how I will keep on managing all these when I have a fulltime job again. All because somehow life has been horrible enough to me and I 'deserve' to have an easy ride now. \n\nI don't like who I am. But every time I try to change it, well it doesn't last long. I will get up early one day because I have to be somewhere in the morning and then proceed to stay up until 4AM or later. I'm way beyond weather excuses about why I can't exercise. I eat horrible because food = pleasure and I can't seem to stand not having that. My willpower and tolerance are just not there. It's ruining even my daily enjoyment because I carry around so much guilt. I hate to admit it but I think in a way I'm exactly like an addict, except I don't abuse a substance. I just much rather perfection my leisure time and performance in games and get my household down to a tee rather than finding a new job and all the challenges that come with that. I mean seriously, I don't need to be on unemployment benefits, but somehow a part of me feels entitled to because I worked hard and got nothing but bad treatment for it. I full well know there are many good companies out there, and that if I temper my expectations I can find a job that suits me, but when it comes to it I rather use an excuse such as \"Oh I can't look for jobs today yet because I need to first take time to work on this volunteer writing project I somehow value above financial stability\". \n\nI need some help. I am seeing my therapist on Thursday and part of me wants to just admit the whole thing. But I am scared it will turn out I am now somehow 'broken', I am just lazy and spoiled and irresponsible and generally a horrible human being. I know it would be extremely liberating but at the same time I know when I do that I need to stop a whole lot of things. I'll have to admit that my productive todo list is maybe 25% essential things and 75% todos for gaming and leisure projects. Not to mention that at times I just have a weekend or even a whole week where I do the bare minimum and go into stuff like Netflix binges because \"I have earned this\". I spend ungodly amounts worrying about all this too, and then I stress because \"oh I have only managed to spend 6 hours on cleaning my gaming backlog, I swear I did more while working\" or \"gee I have all this time to actually set up an exercise and food regimen and I don't do it\". \n\nAnyway I can keep on rambling about it and it is past 4AM now. What should I do? Admit this? Or try to set myself some deadlines and clean up my act on my own and never talk about it again? I'd be stuck with the guilt though and I am not even sure I will succeed. 90% chance I wake up tomorrow and continue as I have because I already have a week of excuses ahead of me. ",

            "selftext": "As a teenager/young adult I struggled with severe anxiety and depression. I eventually sought professional help and those problems are under control now, but I still have some weird self-esteem issues.\n\nIt's tough to explain because I feel like I really do like myself. Like anybody I have my share of strengths and weaknesses, but I take my strengths seriously and don't diminish them. I know I'm a smart person. I know I'm talented. People tell me I'm funny frequently enough that I believe it's true. I have a lot of friends and I'm generally well-liked by my coworkers.\n\nBut lurking in the back of my mind is this perpetual fear that if I let anybody get too close, they'll find out the truth about me, and the truth is that I'm just not good enough. I feel like I'm inherently unlovable, and as soon as the people I care about figure it out, they'll bail. So I keep pretty much everyone at arm's length.\n\nI was abandoned by a parent when I was little and I feel like there's a relationship between that experience and these feelings. Even though intellectually I know my abandonment wasn't my fault, it's like my brain just doesn't get the message.\n\nCan anyone relate to this?",

            "selftext": "Hey /r/anxiety,\nI'm a freshman physics and computer science double major struggling with GAD, and I just had my first round of exams. Every single one of them was a D or lower, even though each class I have nearly perfect homework and project grades. Each exam is worth about a quarter of my grade in each class, and every single time I go into an exam I feel nauseous and disoriented and I forget absolutely everything that I know about that subject and walk out half an hour later and vomit. I absolutely cannot stop thinking about how terrifying a single test that is worth so much is and can't calm myself down or do anything to make it better. \n\nLast semester I managed to skate through with fairly decent grades, and exams were worth a little less, but now my GPA is going to be in the toilet because all of the perfect homework and projects in the world mean nothing when you fail each exam. Grad school is my ultimate goal, so a completely rotten GPA starting out is basically a giant red X on the world of my dreams, which really doesn't help the existential terror I feel when I walk into an exam room.\n\nWhat do I do? I can't keep going on like this, but I have no idea where to start. The school I attend is an extremely large northeastern university, and I don't have individual relationships with most professors nor do we allow resits for any exam. I don't have anything on file with disability services because I previously hadn't needed it, I never experienced any anxiety around tests in high school. I also do not have any medication. \n\nI work extremely hard and feel like I have a solid grasp of most of the material, and I love doing projects and solving homework problems. These exams are just absolutely killing me though, and I feel inadequate and like a failure because I have just nothing to show for my effort. Help?",
