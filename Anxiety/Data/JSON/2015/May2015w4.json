As I have matured and become older though, I have started to feel unconfortable at home as it's not 'normal'. Therefore I try to leave my house to the mall or something at least once a day to get that feeling of being 'refreshed' and 'phew, I'm back home'.\n\nWhenever my friends tell me to go out with them, I say yes and go along. But my feelings betray me if they cancel the plans and my heart gives a giant leap and I sink back into my chair.\n\nSomething else that could identify what my problem is: I feel like everyone is always judging me. I used to be overweight and unfit, but now I guess my body is neither bad nor good, 15% body fat and not that much muscle but nothing to be ashamed of or proud of. Yet, I still feel nervous around others, the exception being my best friends and family.\n\nAny others out there like me please stand up and tell!",

I found out my parents were struggling financially and wrote them a check that was half of what I had saved up for the down payment on a home (for them). Back to square one in the land of poverty. I'm angry and distraught... I never imagined a day like this would come so soon so fast (I'm 25).\n\nFast forward to tonight. The building next door catches on fire and half a dozen firetrucks and police cars arrive. I open my window and a police officer asks if I'm okay. He sounds really genuine and kind. However I'm wearing a beauty face mask so I look ridiculous. I laugh for the first time today.\n\nAn hour passes and the smell of smoke wakes me up at 3am. The crew is still working so I contemplate whether to bring them some snacks &amp; drinks. The entire time I'm getting it ready, I'm wondering if I'll be able to approach the crew without having a panic attack. What if they shoo me away? Or if they don't like iced tea? Screw it, I'm doing it. \n\nI went over in my bright pink robe and approached a fireman by himself (no way in hell I'm talking to a group at once). He thanked me genuinely and I stuttered and stammered while trying to express my appreciation. The small victory made me feel so happy and grateful walking back home. I'm alive, and I'm doing everything I can to keep it that way. I'd be devastated if something happened to me or my family. We love each other so much, even more when we struggle like this. That's why I'm gonna wake up in 4 hours to face another day. Good night.",

            "selftext": "I hope this is the right place to post this. \n\nI am a 20 year-old male, over the past few years I seem to have developed an immense fear of my heart stopping. I don't know how or when exactly it started, I just suddenly became very aware of my heartbeat and the fact that in one instant I could be dead.\n\nI sometimes get these pains on the left side of my chest, mainly when I am worried. Multiple doctors have told me that this is because of my anxiety instead of a heart attack, but I just **can't** bring myself to believe them.\n\nI have had an EKG done and spent several nights at the emergency room because I was *convinced* that I was going to die. Each time the doctors told me my heart was fine and that I didn't have anything to worry about. The EKG turned out fine, too.\n\nThe main reason why I am so afraid of this is because I simply can't grasp how one small organ can keep my entire body functioning 24/7. Like how some people can't bring themselves to trust in a pilot's ability to safely fly the plane, I can't fully trust my heart in its ability to keep me alive, silly as it sounds. \n\nThoughts will often enter my mind like; what's the point in spending countless hours studying and spending five days a week working if I could drop dead at any moment? Why is that CEO spending so much time at his job instead of with his family if he could be gone just like that? It just seems weird to me.\n\nI'm just *constantly* expecting my heart to stop beating and it's driving me absolutely insane. \n\nI was wondering if maybe anyone would know what this is called? does anyone have any experience with this?\n\nThank you for reading.\n\n\nEDIT: Phrasing",

            "selftext": "[23/m] From as young as I can remember, I always suffered with anxiety that I could never pinpoint. It was just an undercurrent of who I am. As i grew older I became aware that this isn't something everyone experiences. I had a happy and social childhood, but anxiety always ruined portions of my life. When I hit secondary (high) school, It took a major hold over my life. It developed into social anxiety but only in very certain situations. The fear of having an attack around people drove me into avoiding eating in front of others and intimacy. I have found it nearly impossible to eat in front of strangers or in a one-on-one situation. So restaurants are completely off limits unless with family or in a permanent state of panic with a girlfriends family once.\n\n I've held down a few relationships but anxiety has destroyed every one eventually.   When my last relationship ended around 21 i told myself I was incapable of being in a relationship with anyone. Last year one was of the best years of my life, I was relatively social and from my parents point of view \"you've never shown any signs\" so i was just living life as normally as i could. Started studying last year and ended up challenging my avoidance behaviours a little more. Went away to foreign country with friends, music festivals, things i would never ever have thought was possible for me. It was rough but I got through it. \n\nCome last october. While revising i skipped seeing friends and gym for a couple of weeks and, one of the worst things to remind me of my anxiety, . . . i met a girl. This has plunged me into one of the worst prolonged episodes of anxiety of my entire life. Yesterday, having finished my last exam for the summer i got home and was staring into the sky when i broke down and reached out to my cousin. Then my parents. Last night was one of the weirdest experiences of my life and i still can't believe it's happened. I'm aim to start therapy and get help because I can't do it anymore. I browsed on this subreddit for so long always reading about how it's easier to talk and i remember thinking, \"there is absolutely no way on this earth i'm sharing this with anyone in my entire life\". Even my parents, the thought of sharing this with them was the worst idea ever. I'm not sure how I feel now, I was kind of expecting it to feel really different, but it doesn't. Don't get me wrong talking about it has released so much weight off and i'm glad i've done it.\n\nI told her today. It was great. She's amazing. \n\nIf this can even remotely help someone then it was worth posting, but i'd ask anyone who has any help for me to come forward. This is completely new territory for me and I don't know what to expect.\n\nEdit: To anyone who still see's this, the girl i mentioned is now my girlfriend of 2 weeks and she knows everything. I never thought this day would ever come and i couldn't be happier",

But all of these movies end up being huge social events for my friends that everyone is talking about for weeks or months.

It makes me feel really alienated and I'm ashamed to be like \"I just don't think I can handle seeing it right now.\"\n\nI'm not sure if this is more of an anxiety thing or a Highly Sensitive Person thing, but I think there's enough of an overlap that maybe I'm not alone here?",

            "selftext": "about me: 24, woman, general anxiety, major depression\n\nI've been wanting to write about this for a while, but I am not sure I can verbalize it well. Here goes...\n\nI notice I have a lot of anxiety when it comes to watching movies, TV shows, and even playing video games. It's not that I feel like I shouldn't be doing these things for whatever reason. It's that I get overwhelmed.\n\nI don't watch many TV shows, but people are always telling me about these awesome shows. Plus, new things are always coming out. I have a few shows I watch, but they tend to be older shows and ones I've watched. I think it's because they are familiar. I don't want to get involved with new characters and their dramas and how that might trigger me. Movies are easier because there is less commitment. 2 or so hours, I can deal with it.\n\nThen there are video games. I like them and play them, but also get overwhelmed. I also get intimidated by different games than what I am used to. I feel like I won't be able to learn, or am not good enough. I do feel guilty when I don't finish a game though. I feel like it's a personal failure. I try to remember life is too short to keep doing things you don't enjoy, especially when it comes to hobbies, but it's still a weird mindset to get out of.\n\nAlso, when I am doing one of these things I need to be doing something else. For example, I can't just sit and watch a movie if I am alone. I also have to be playing video games. It's like I need a lot going on to distract me from my thoughts.\n\nThen I tend to get depressed because it feels like I can't enjoy anything properly.\n\nI don't know if I am describing this well. It seems silly to get anxious over entertainment and hobbies. Anybody get this way?",

I don't normally do shadowing or have shadowing over my work with trainees (I work in a call centre, so they stare at me while I talk on the phone). Sometimes I am asked to do it, and in the past I've done it no problem.\n\nI thought I dealt with the situation as best as I could. I politely excused myself to go to the washroom, and just said I had a bit of nerves. The two trainees said, \"no worries.\"\n\nI came back, and since I had already done enough demonstration with the trainees they moved onto something else.\n\nI thought my manager's discussion about my anxiety was a little dense. I just told her I was having an anxiety attack and if I could go into break.\n\nHer reply was, \"why did you allow those trainees to work with you if you feel like that.\"\n\nI said it normally isn't always an issue, and I wasn't anxious at that moment in time.\n\nShe said, \"well you must have made it weird for them when you left.\"\n\nI had an anxiety attack is all. I very politely explained to the two employees I was going to the bathroom. I didn't run out of the room like it was on fire.\n\nNow I feel anxious about talking to my manager as she seems kind of unapproachable to me.\n\nWhat should I do?\n\nI do have nerves a lot at work, and now that it's out, and not hiding as well, I feel kind of under a spotlight. I am mostly worried about my boss's lack of understanding.",

Your ADHD reminds you of all the other times you made this mistake. It's like the worst montage ever.\n\nStep three. Your anxiety launches. Not only the anxiety of the mistake, but this great leftover doggie bag of all the other times you messed up. It's like anxiety inception. \n\nStep four. Due to the anxiety you have (and perhaps other people being upset) your ADHD runs rampant because you can't manage anything right now. Our Executive Function, the manager of our brain, the command center just takes a nap on the couch. \n\nStep five. Now that you can't manage, your ADHD is running the show, you are worked up, you continue to make mistakes and so your ADHD mind leaps back to step one. \n\nLet me know if I'm missing a step.

I feel like i'm on the edge of one 24/7. I **promise** you guys, I have meditated really hard on this feeling, I cannot find a reason for it in my concious brain. I am not stressed or worried about anything particular. My body is just panicking. \n\nNow i'm having really scary symptoms. I can't think some days, I can barely get a word out of my mouth at random points of the day. I'm so tired all the time. I can't bring myself to go running any more, i've got awful at rock climbing. I'm having crazy muscle weakness and cramps and twinges. Hardcore constipation , won't go to the bathroom for a week, then I will go 10 times a day for a week, then back again.

She is just treating the occasional symptom, and refuses to look at the big picture.\n\nThis has been going on for months and now i'm at the point where I can handle this anymore, I don't know what to do.

When I have clarity and energy, I am a great helper. When I am tired and weak, I feel myself being drained, and negative emotions become more prominent, and they hurt. I guess I care too much about others? I want to be fair to everyone and I do not want to hurt anyone. Maybe I'm not out of the ordinary, but I feel the need to open up, and hear feedback. I was never this sensitive before until recently. I'm still unsure why.\n\nI was on Paxil &amp; Wellbutrin about a year ago. I'm eating healthy and exercising now. I've learned to operate myself better so life has become more easily manageable. I am just unsure about what to do with my hypersensitivity. It's great that my intuition has the capacity to feel you from across the room, but I do have limited strength, and when I become weak, I need it shut off. I try to \"not think\", but the feeling is still there, I cannot ignore it. I decided I would be better off if it were toned down. \n\nI'm wondering what the best option from here is. What should I do to deal with my problem of hypersensitivity? Should I try an SSRI again? Is there a better medicine other than SSRI to deal with my problem? My doctor recommends Venlafaxine (Effexor, an SNRI). Please any help would be great.\n\nI just want to operate normally without being worried and caught up in how other people are thinking. I no longer want to feel them (as much). :)\n",
