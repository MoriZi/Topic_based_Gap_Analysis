            "selftext": "I don't know if this is a personality disorder or what (both on my end and theirs), but my entire family is absolutely horrible at creating a plan and sticking to it. When I was a little kid I'd throw tantrums over this because I'd assume that when someone said they'd do something, they'd do it. It hurts more because it's not like they're lying to me, they honestly believe they're going to follow the plan and then don't. \n\nNowadays I don't throw tantrums but when it happens a lot, it makes me nervous. Usually it's when people (mostly my family) say they want to do X, Y, and Z, and I also need to do one of those things so they invite me along, and then they end up either not doing the one I'm there for or just not doing any of them, and I can't help but think \"well shit, I still need to get X done, I wish I had just stayed home today so I could do it myself\". \n\n\nUsually around this point I ask to be dropped off somewhere near my house/car so I can just go do it myself, the answer is always no, that \"this is a good time to learn a lesson in flexibility\". And I don't WANT to be flexible, I want to get X done, that's why I left the house today, I made a plan and I want to follow it. And they're so nonchalant about it like \"just do X tomorrow you don't need to do it now, do it whenever\" and the thing is, for me I *do* need to do it now because I made a plan to do it, and the fact that everyone around me is so wishy washy about it is so frustrating I can't deal with it. \n\nThis happened to me today and while I have a lot of other shit on my mind, it affected me a lot. We made a plan, hyped it up, decided that's what we were going to do, and then at the absolute last minute they decided they didn't want to go along with it. I would have gone along with it by myself and had a great time, but we had already decided to take someone else's car so it wouldn't have worked. I asked to be taken home so I could go do it myself and was told no, so I had an awful time and halfway through the thing I was so frustrated I cried. \n",

Maybe sharing will help us calm down.\n\nI'm not sure how fast my heart was going, but I'm sitting at ~80 bpm now and still feeling jittery. I'm pretty sure I may have been having a bad dream because I felt super scared when I woke up. As always, I had to remind myself that it was just anxiety and not a heart attack waking me up. \n\nI've been doing so well lately, too. Been sleeping comfortably throughout the night for almost a month straight with no issues. I guess we'll all have setbacks every once in a while...\n\n... But damn, it's still *so* discouraging. \n\n**Edit:** So glad to hear all the stories of people who go through this too! It's easy to feel alone when you're in the thick of it.

            "selftext": "Hello everyone - Sorry if your brains hurt, or there is pain in your life at the moment. I'm suffering on and off at the moment - I posted in /leaves (the weed quitting reddit) but I know that a lot of my anxiety is a simple predisposition towards panic and fear - one that has been with me since I was a boy. I'm now 36 and it's been a constant battle throughout my life.....but I look on it as a gift (when I can) and an opportunity to get to know my innermost thoughts.\n\nA SIMPLE THOUGHT TO HELP WITH ANXIETY\nI wanted to give back to anyone reading, as a few posts have really helped me over the last day or two. I hope someone finds this useful.\n\n- I realise some of my anxiety and panic attacks are brought on by a fixation on things that could go wrong and really hurt or injure me.\n\n- I try to deal with it by learning to be okay with the thought of any of these bad things happening to me, like if they actually happened, really what does it matter, we're all going to pass away one day...\n\n- But I realised today, by thinking like that I wasn't dealing with the &gt;&gt;source&lt;&lt; of the anxiety, merely learning to be okay with the &gt;&gt;fantasy outcome&lt;&lt; ....in my case, death.\n\n- So I looked at my current mood and my pretty negative outlook at the moment - And I realise it colours so many things....predictions about how the future will turn out. But I also realise that none of these things, like literally NONE OF MY FALSE BELIEFS have any grounding in reality, or my own experience.\n\n- So if I'm basing my outlook on a FALSE SET OF IMAGINARY BELIEFS, and allowing those to influence me, why not imagine this&gt;&gt;:\n------------Imagine that everything will be perfect, imagine that the people I meet will be friendly, imagine that I will be happier than I could imagine, imagine I was always going to be safe, always going to be ok with life.\n\n- if you suffer from anxiety and it's because of negative and fear based predictions, well you know you're deluding yourself, but it's still real for you. You still live with this awful feeling. So why not live with a blissful feeling (one that is SO MUCH MORE PROBABLE) of safety and lack of anything terrible happening to you. I assume, if anything really bad had happened to most of you, you wouldn't be reading this, and even if anything terrible has happened, it's only happened once, or twice (forgive my assumptions) - so still, the GREATER LIKELYHOOD is that NOTHING BAD WILL HAPPEN AGAIN, that you will live at worst, a boring, confused and average life, and at best a life where you find some greater meaning, or merely learn to exist happily, realising the power of your existence is probably totally down to you and how you view the strange world of reality.\n\n- And if something does go wrong, well, deal with it then - And deal with it you will....It's strange, the worst things that have ever happened to me are the thoughts that accompany the odd shitty moment in my life. The things themselves, the expereinces, they weren't all that bad...it's always been the repercussions in my brain. It's always been the mental trauma that hurt the most. Own worst enemy...anyone relate? :)\n\nSo thanks for reading what turned into a ramble. I hope someone gets something from it - And thanks for letting me post, it's good for me to get these things down on paper.\n\nMuch love.\n\n",

I went to the bathroom and came back into the living room and he was standing with his gun pointed to his own head. I didn't feel like my life was being threatened so I crossed the room to try and get the gun away from him. He let me take the gun from him,  but then wouldn't let me take my hands off of the gun or put it down. He just pointed it back at his head and kept asking me to pull the trigger. I kept telling him I couldn't do it and that it wasn't  really what he wanted. Before I could do anything about having no control over the gun in my hands, he pulled the trigger and killed himself. I had his blood and brain matter on my face and arms. I began screaming and freaking out because I was drunk by that point. I didn't know what to do. Since then, I have begun to have panic attacks and freak out almost on a daily basis and sometimes multiple times in a single day. All of my known coping mechanisms aren't working and I don't know what else I can do. I'm currently in therapy, but it isn't really helping with the panic attacks and nightmares that I now have.

Recently I decided to finally get help and today I saw a psychiatrist who prescribed me Lexapro and Valium\n\nI've been advised to take both before going to bed which should be now but all I've been doing for the last hour is sitting up comtemplating actually taking my medication or not. \n\nI'm terrified. I don't want it to change who I am, how I feel about my loved ones or just generally make me regret trying it. \n\nI've never taken antidepressants or anything of the sort before so this is an extremely scary experience for me. \n\nDoes anybody around these parts have experience with lexapro or other SSRI's? What should I be expecting in the first few weeks? Should I take this medication or not? Will it ultimately help?\n\nHonestly I've never been so frightened in my life, any help would be good, thank you guys! ",

My latest review for my doctorate said I greeted and connected with clients confidently, and I have no problem making conversation with people. However, I have two close friends who live near me right now, and the anxiety with them is getting so bad I'm considering ending the friendships or at least taking a long hiatus. Has anyone had this problem? Does anxiety lend itself to a lack of trust?\n\n\nWhen we hang out in groups now, I end up just being silent. The other two will discuss things they know I know nothing about, and interrupting people makes me shake. When I do talk, I'm frequently talked over. They know I have anxiety and logically I know they're not intentionally trying to make me feel terrible. I just feel like strangers or early friendships treat me better until they realize there's a scared person underneath the confident facade, and then I get trampled on. \n\n\nThey'll also (unintentionally, I hope) call attention to my anxieties....like I asked one friend how I performed during a public speaking thing, and she said, \"Oh, you did fine during it. But your face turned bright red when the prof was giving you feedback.\" Okay. Not exactly something I (as a SAD person) can work on since it's my autonomic nervous system taking over. Or, \"I bought these scrubs but the pants are WAY too baggy on me. I was thinking of giving them to you thistooshalll,\" even though she knows I'm very insecure about the weight I've gained. \n\n\nWe have a constant facebook messenger going, and every time I hear it beep my stomach literally twists in knots. I'm trying very hard to be a positive person and not complain all the time to lessen the effects of GAD, and one of my friends uses the facebook messenger to complain about every single thing that happens to her during the day. I get about 20 messages from them every day of the week, and I feel sick/unhappy when I have to open it. I'm finding too that when we hang out I feel awful afterwards, and the anxiety \"decompression\" will last for days.  My husband is at the end of his rope from hearing about them. \n\n\nI feel like they don't actually care about me, and I beat myself up if I open up to them about what's going on in my life (like my mom is very sick and I updated one of them about it a couple days ago) because I think I shouldn't have let them in. Since I know my perception is all messed up being a GAD/SAD person I don't know if it's them or me, and I don't know how to make it better. \n\n\ntl;dr: My two best friends make me literally silent/sick with anxiety, and I don't know if it's them or me. Has anyone else dealt with this, and what helped? ",

            "selftext": "I'm 23 and about to move out of my mom's house for my own good, except now I'll have to worry about money more than ever. I'm looking at jobs online and I start trembling at the thought of it. I've had jobs before but they only lasted a few months for various reasons (barista at a coffee shop and a restaurant, employee at Six Flags park and 1 year in the army reserve). It was fine then but now I feel like I need to get a \"real job\" and it's freaking me out.\n\nI dropped out of school more than once, because I have no discipline and I'm a pessimist I guess, so I don't have anything concrete to put in a resume. I'm a Graphic Designer and trying freelance right now but it seems hopeless. A fair price always seems too expensive for people and then there's always some schmuck who doesn't give a crap and does the job for something like $50. It's the only thing I'm \"good\" at that I enjoy but without a degree in it to show the employers and with all the competition online, I can't see a future in it.\n\nSo I'm freaking out right now. When I start thinking \"ok just send out resumes and whatever\" then I think about how I'll have to do an interview and probably fuck it up. If I pass the interview then I'll have to work with people and if I don't like them I'll be stuck with them. I don't mind working with customers but thinking about dealing with a boss and colleagues makes me anxious. If all this is fine then what if I have to do a task I can't do so the boss will be angry/disappointed and I'll make the company lose money.\n\nIt's probably the same reason why I'm not looking for a girlfriend. I don't want to be a burden to anyone. I don't even talk to my friends anymore because I know they will silently judge me, pity me or straight up get annoyed and I don't want none of that. I'm a loser right now and I don't want to always be but I feel stuck that way. All my friends are future doctors/pharmacists/dentists, engineers, lawyers or accountants.\n\nSo I guess I'm asking: people who have been in a similar situation, how did you get out of it? ",
