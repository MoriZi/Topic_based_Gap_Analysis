It was super scary when I first had an attack and all the physical affects afterwards because I had no idea what it was. After two trips to the walk-in clinic and some blood work, I figured out I am healthy and just have anxiety. I started doing a lot of reading into it and tried to understand anxiety. I saw multiple things all over the Internet where people said anxiety put strains on their relationships because their SO's did not understand. This worried me a little. \nThis past week was bad for me anxiety wise and I was constantly going to my SO for support. I felt needy and I was worried it would push him away. I would tell him every time I started to feel bad or anxious like he could fix it in some way. He didn't always know what to do, but he will still there for me. \n\nThis past weekend he messaged me one night after I had left and asked me exactly how I feel when anxiety comes on. He replied asking me if I get a \"feeling of urgency euphoria and slight tingling in the body, stiffness cramp muscular tension hot flashes, and emotional sensitive to changes in environment.\" I said yes, that is exactly how I feel. He used to LSD a long time ago and said that is how he felt 20-30 minutes after taking. He completely understands how I feel now and is much better/more sensitive to me when I tell him it is happening. \n\n\nI just felt I needed to share my happiness with everyone. I hope your SO's understand you too!",

            "selftext": "About 2 years ago, in the summer between 9th and 10th grade, I developed social anxiety and panic disorder out of nowhere. At that time I was taking some extra classes at a community college, and I took the bus there everyday. When I was on the bus I started thinking that people where staring at me, and when people spoke to me anywhere, I would freeze and take a long time to talk. I had never experienced anything like this before, and after a few months of having anxiety, I became depressed. When 10th grade started I realized that all of the inside jokes and things that I used to talk about with friends didn't come to mind anymore, and I began to OCD (which I had since 5th grade but much more mild) excessively in an effort to cure my anxiety, but as a result became mentally exhausted afterschool. By the end of the semester my GPA was a 2.7 and for some reason, I didn't care that much anymore like I used to. Before I had anxiety, my GPA was a 3.8 and I dreamed of going to an Ivy League and taking more challenging courses throughout my highschool career. In the past two months, I have realized that I have lost my direction in life and sometimes the world and my former self, seem so unfamiliar to me. I feel like I mimic the thoughts and actions of other people because I have lost mine, but I can't remember who I used to be. I am currently in 11th grade and doing much better in school since I have received treatment for my OCD, but I feel like my way of speaking has been \"dumbed-down\" in a way and that my true personality is trapped beneath this layer of anxiety.  Does anyone else notice that they don't speak like their unique selves and that they can't speak as quickly or intelligently as they used too? Thank you for your time.",

            "selftext": "Just got out of the ER yesterday for chest pain that had been getting increasingly worse for the past few days. It felt like I couldn't fully breathe and there was a constant pressure against my chest. I had gone to urgent care a few days before, where they thought I might have untreated asthma and some inflammation in my chest. The past two days after visiting urgent care, the pain was so bad at night that I was having difficulties sleeping. Finally went to the ER last night, where the doctor's final conclusion was this: I did have inflammation in my chest that needed to be taken care of, but the severity of it was being caused by my untreated anxiety.\n\nI've never taken medication to regulate my anxiety, and when I was originally diagnosed, my anxiety hadn't seemed like it was severe enough for medication. I hadn't been feeling particularly stressed before getting sick, so it came as a bit of a surprise to me that my anxiety could have been causing my so much pain.\n\nI ended up taking an anti-anxiety pill at the hospital, and it helped immensely. Although I can still feel a slight pain in my chest, I can breathe and I feel a lot better. I also slept for like 12 hours afterwards, which was a huge plus after two days of very little sleep.\n\nI'm not sure what the overall point of this post is, but I guess I'm saying that I never realized how anxiety could manifest itself physically until now. It was also a bit of a wake-up call that I might need to talk to my doctor about finding an anti-anxiety medication that works for me.",

It's been tough since the beginning, but I want to get better so I've been trudging through it without feeling like anything's changed. \n\nToday I had my first real \"aha\" moment that maybe the citalopram and talk therapy are working so I should keep going with this path of treatment. I want to share and see what yours was, what was the first positive change you noticed that helped you push forward?\n\nI'm now living with two new people in my house after 5 years of living with my (now ex) boyfriend. For the past couple years I had routines and systems and things were done a certain way. For instance I had a system to my dish cupboard and it used to bother me when things weren't put away \"my way\". It was something so trivial but would set me off. I would have to reorganize it right away because if I sat on the couch, I'd know the glasses weren't right. I'd get anxious and annoyed. Not a major anxiety attack, of course, but definitely not the response of a normal person who found that the small glasses were switched around with the tall ones.\n\nToday my newest houseguest decided to be nice and empty the dishwasher. She's only been here a couple weeks so she doesn't know where everything goes. Most of the glassware and plates had been washed up,so the cupboards were blank canvasses.I opened the cupboard to find she put it away completely differently than I would have. And I just grabbed a glass and closed the cupboard.\n\nIt's something small, not earth shattering, but something that 12 months ago me would get worked up over. Even six months ago I would have taken everything out and put the dishes away \" in the right place they belonged\" because the anxiety of having my order upside down would upset me. But today it didn't bother me, and I thought, \"this is progress.\"\n\nIt's enough to keep going at it. I can see that if I'm not spending so much time letting little things lead to bigger anxiety issues, I am letting go of some of my triggers and can focus on more positive things.I can see it starting to work and it gives me some hope.\n\n***tl;dr*** I finally saw that my medication is working with my anxiety when I didn't freak out over dishes not being put away how I was used to. Interested in everyone else's first realization that maybe things were getting better?",

I have to build up courage to even make an appointment. I have had lots of stuff happen to me (which is why SO requested I see someone. He sees a therapist but says my past is way worse than anything he has experienced) but I've always dealt with it myself. Being the only child who didn't turn to drugs after a series of unfortunate events, I didn't want or enjoy help. My dad tried to get me to see a therapist when I was young. I hated it, I hated being in that position. Especially because my dad needed one way more than me. I have lots of anxiety but the idea of seeing a therapist amplifies it to the point where I feel sick. I just wanted to post and get it off my chest. Other people see therapists all the time but ugh, I'm so stressed.\n\nEdit: thank you, helpful people! I feel less intimidate but still anxious. I get 9 free visits to the counseling center. It may or may not be my cup of tea but it won't hurt to see how it goes. I'm making an appointment tomorrow. They make you go in to make an appointment so maybe just that will make me less anxious about the whole thing. Again, thanks so much. Glad to hear from you all\n\nEdit edit: appointment made today!!!
