Not even potential bad things in the future, just the future in general and knowing my entire life will pass by inevitably. I dwell on this daily and it's seriously taking a toll on me. People say \"don't worry, you can't control it so don't bother stressing\" but I can't stop.\n\nIn particular I worry about my ex girlfriend's future, I guess because I love her, but she's out of my life. I worry I'll forget about her, and then I worry I won't forget about her. Maybe this whole thing revolves around her. Losing someone I wanted in my life might have warped my perception of the future. I don't know... heartbreak + anxiety is a serious recipe for disaster.\n\nSorry for the rant, I've just felt bottled up for ages and I don't have many people to share this with (plus I sound like an obsessive loon)",

I had been awake since 4am for work, and had been driving for four hours to a big city for the first time. Around 7pm I got lost there, took the wrong exit and had to travel a fair distance to a roundabout only to eventually take the same wrong exit again. (Thanks Sat nav)\n\nFrustrated, shaking and crying, I went too quickly around a corner I didn't see coming soon enough, after cutting someone off from a slip lane and lost control of my car. It spun a few times and crashed into a wall at the side of a dual carriageway before a tunnel. The bumper came off and the back was scratched a lot but, I was unhurt and no other cars were involved. \n\n\nTwo ladies came out to help me, one of them being the person I cut off. They basically discussed with each other in front of me how I was driving like a crazy person while also getting help for me. \n\n\nI have never been so ashamed or frightened. I've been shaking and crying since it happened yesterday. I feel like, as someone who already suffers from anxiety, this is me totally mentally fucked now. I'm on edge, I feel immense guilt for the people I could have potentially hurt if I'd swerved into the road instead and I feel completely useless as a driver and by extension a functioning member of society. And isn't it just the worst when one of your worst paranoid fears actually comes to fruition? I'd had so many nightmares about crashing I was actually half expecting to wake up at any moment.\n\n\nDriving anxiety is something I took a long time learning to control, but now I feel I'm back to square one. No, square negative one. I don't want to drive anywhere ever again. The worst part was, when my car was spinning all I could think was \"I fucking KNEW I'd die in a stupid way like this\" \n\n\nSo I have to find a new way home from the city for work on Monday, face my parents who gifted me the car and also find a way to get to their home for Christmas without my car. \n\n\nHas anyone else been in an accident? Did you start driving again soon after? Did you need counselling? If you were liable how do you get over the guilt and feeling of uselessness?\n\n\nThanks for reading. Merry fuckin' Christmas.",

I've been to the public mental health centre three times in the past year, as well as visited the ER, talked with my doctor, and called the crisis line multiple times. I live in Canada though where our mental health services are incredibly overburdened and underfunded so people like me who are \"functioning\" (able to go to work, have a general grasp on what some of the issues are) get kind of left behind. \n\nI tried to search for counsellors out of the public health network, knowing I'd probably have to pay out of pocket and just eat the cost (over $100 per session), but they all seemed to be very specialised - things like drug addiction, domestic abuse, marital counselling, children and youth. I kept getting phone numbers for places that would just never work out as I didn't \"fit\". \n\nMy coworker's young daughter is seeing a counsellor in town that I'd never heard of for her anxiety and my coworker seemed to be really happy with her, so I got the number and gave her a call. She got me in within a week and I finally saw her yesterday. \n\nIt was so nice to get my whole situation put into perspective. My workplace is a bit of a toxic environment - well that's an understatement - but I feel like no one else from head office sees that. It was starting to make me feel a bit crazy and just out of control of myself. She confirmed that yeah it's not right at all, showed me how this is totally a textbook thing, and gave me some tools to help deal with it. Also gave me some exercises to help with my anxiety when I'm having an attack, and just to help calm my brain down. \n\nToday at work has been like a complete 180. I actually enjoy being at work, I'm calm. Some of the main offenders haven't really bothered me as much as they did, and I feel motivated (for once!). I don't know if it helped just having someone listen to me, but it is liberating. Today I'm not living under a black cloud, I know it may come back but I'm going to enjoy today. ",

            "selftext": "I'm beginning to realize that I am filled with more pain, worry, and discomfort from being afraid of negative emotions, than by how those emotions would actually feel. I worry so much about a potentially negative outcome (that probably won't even happen) and how that would feel.\n\nFor example, when speaking in front of a group, I worry that I will misspeak and embarrass myself. The weeks I spend worrying about this causes knots in my stomach to the point of nausea, and eventual dread of the speech. If I were to actually misspeak, which most of us do, it is likely that the group won't even notice, care or judge me for it. But even in the case that they do judge me, and I am embarrassed, this embarrassment may last a few hours or days.  The severity of the embarrassment is not improved by adding additional weeks to that pain preparing for it. If anything, by hyping it up so much, I've made it feel much worse. \nAnother example: I feel terrified that my partner will leave me when he finds someone 'better'. But when I think about how it would actually feel to be left, feel hurt, and have to put myself back together - it is probably less unpleasant than the amount of time and energy I've spent making myself sick over it! Not to mention the amount of distraction worrying can cause in other area of my life.  And by worrying about it, I'm actually doubling the amount of time this issue is affecting me!\n\nWhen 'battling' with my thoughts and inner dialogue, I find that it is a worthwhile exercise to consider how I would respond to a loved one. If a good friend of mine comes up and says \"Hey! I'm freaking out! I'm SO nervous about this presentation! What if I embarrass myself! What do I do?!\" Would I response with \"OMG! You have every reason to worry! Ahh!! Let's freak out! You're never going to survive that!\"...Of course not. I would tell them \"Hey, no need to work yourself up about this so much. It's not doing you any good. Maybe you can work on the presentation more to make sure you're more confident in your words. Otherwise, maybe you can work on some other projects that need your attention right now, since you've done all the preparation you can do for this presentation. Would you like a hug? Let's get a cup of tea.\" So rarely do we respond with the kind of kindness and compassion that we would a friend. \n\nBy allowing myself to ruminate on these worries, I'm only doing myself a disservice. I'm not mitigating the risk of the outcome at all and I'm only making myself feel awful for longer.  I'm very thankful for my meditation and mindfulness practice that have allowed me to calm my fears down before they spiral out of control. Don't get me wrong - it hasn't been overnight - it's taken years of practice. But little by little I'm able to get my emotions under control instead of allowing them to control me.",

            "selftext": "My therapists have diagnosed me with GAD, PTSD,  and OCD. I've also learned therapists are often far too under qualified to be giving advice and for way too much money. 6 therapists in 6 years. Here's my journey.\n\nThe first one was cheating on his wife. I coached him through it until I realized I was *his* psychologist. He ended up hitting on me and that was the last straw with him.\n\nI tried to manage on my own for awhile. Exercise, cutting out caffeine, trying a regular sleep schedule, and reading everything I could regarding my disorders. \n\nIt didn't hold. A year without therapy. A horrible breakup with my cheating ex-girlfriend drove me back to therapy.\n\nTherapist #2 was a godsend and saved my life. I couldn't eat nor sleep and ended up in the hospital with an ulcer. The psychiatrist put me on meds. I stayed on them until she said I could safely go off. Then I had to stop seeing her -- my healthcare only allows 23 visits a year, thus, I went 6 months without her. \n\nI lost most of my friends in the breakup. My family, except my mom, didn't know I'm not straight so I couldn't seek comfort from them without coming out. \n\nThen my mom died. I called therapist #2 to make an appointment. Her receptionist said she had passed away too. \n\nTherapist #3 was #2's coworker at the same clinic. I figured they may have the same style, so I went to her. After 3 months I realized she was... crazy. I told her I didn't think it was working. She told me I was suicidal, turned her back on me, and told me to leave her office. I was not suicidal; I was then pissed at the woman who thought I was suicidal and turned her back on me. Then she started petting her crocheted cat. I walked out.\n\nAt this point, the only friends I had were coworkers and I'd rather not break in front of them. My family was mourning my mother's death and I didn't want to burden them with my depression.\n\nTherapist #4 was a drug counselor. I had made alcohol my anxiety remedy at this point, but I knew this was an issue, so I sought help. The counselor did help me sober up, but then she stopped coming to scheduled appointments. After 5 missed appointments in 2 months, I was done. \n\nPretty sure Mr. Rodgers reincarnated was my 5th therapist. That should've been a red flag, but I tried anyway. At one point I told him I was bisexual and he thought I was crazy. (How is that still a thing?) He also recommended reading an anxiety workbook instead of talking in his sessions. Then he resumed his nap in the middle of the session. Hope the old guy's alright. I haven't seen him for months.\n\nAt this point, I was in a relationship again. He was successful, but worked long hours and kind, but poor with dictating his emotions. I would have a panic attack and he would tell me I'm fine. It was innocent enough, but his consoling felt like an insult.\n\nTherapist #6 was a couple's therapist. It didn't work. Anxiety is my most prevalent feeling and but my boyfriend didn't believe me when I said that elephant's always in the room. The elephant wedged itself between us. He can't even see me anymore.\n\nIn fact, I don't think anyone knows me. My family dispersed throughout the country after my mom died. I'm not very good at making friends. I think people assume I have my shit together since I appear healthy, happy, sober, and straight. They assume since I'm amiable that I have friends. That I don't need someone. Little does the world know I could use a friend. A good listener. So much so, I'd even pay someone to listen.\n\n\nAs an aside, I finally got around to reading old, lazy Mr. Rodger's recommended reading list. The book recommended I seek therapy immediately. I see what you're trying to do, books. Just pawn me off on someone else. Easy for you to say, stupid printed text.\n\n\nTL;DR: Most of my therapists were more screwed up than me. Then there was that one therapist that died (how selfish of her!). Still looking for my peace, but tonight I'm just very lonely and sarcastic. \n",

            "selftext": " So my problem is that I suffer with social anxiety and drink is the only thing that helps remotely. I have tried anti-depressants and they didn't work. I can't do CBT because I don't have the money for it. The only thing that ever makes me remotely comfortable around most people is alcohol. When I don't drink, I'm quiet, irritable and keep to myself, except when I meet with my only good friend for a coffee because I don't experience any anxiety around him. \n\n\nI go red extremely easily and generally avoid people as much as possible, especially those more extroverted than me. But as soon as I have 1 or 2 beers, I become the person I want to be. I can go to the bar, interact and not worry about going red or struggling to make conversation. \n\n\nI am 25 years old now and running out of time to deal with this issue which has blighted me since I was 15. I coped in school because I was lucky enough to be around  a few good friends people all of the time so my shyness never got too bad, well not as bad as it is now.  \n\n\nUnfortunately the problem worsened significantly throughout college and I spent my college life as a hermit, keeping to myself almost completely. \n\n\nI have literally missed out on what everyone says are the best days of their lives. It's not as if I wasn't alive or doing anything in those times, I had a girlfriend for 3 years and kept in touch with my mates weekly - but we always drank together. But now i'm single and my friends are becoming more distant as they settle down with partners and my problem is getting worse.\n\n\nI am unemployed and thus don't get much practise with overcoming my anxiety seeing as most of my interaction is either done with my mate who I'm not shy around or with others while i'm drinking. At this point I feel like I wouldn't even be able to cope with going through an interview to get a job. I wish I could be the same sober as I am tipsy or drunk. I really don't understand why I act all irritable and anti-social without drink and content and happy without it. No other substance does that for me. \n\nI don't know what help I'm looking for, or even what help exists - is all hope lost at 25 though?",

Sometimes though when the load becomes too much and I physically feel like my body can't take it anymore, it just stops and I'm almost indifferent.  The first time I really noticed was a few years ago.  I had just separated, was trying to take care of my son half the week, 2 dogs, a house, my dad who lived with me, while working 2 jobs, one that required me to be up at 4, the other getting me home late at night.  In the midst of this my father had a massive heart attack and ended up in cardiac ICU in a hospital 45 minutes away.  So many days I'd be up at 4, work, drive 45 minutes to see my dad, then drive back to the house to let out the dogs, drive 30 minutes in the opposite direction to my other job.  On off days I'd be trying to make it up to the dogs for their neglect, clean, make sure my son was fed and paid attention to. I would sob the whole time while driving, thinking I would rather be dead because I couldn't hold it all together.  And then one day it was like it was done, it was like I couldn't care anymore.  While it's not been as extreme in recent years, I still notice when a lot is going on that my anxiety will ramp up to the point I feel like my body is unable to handle it and is going to keel over, then I fall into a depression for a few days unable to care about anything until I'm back to my regular everyday worry.",

But every single one of them mentioned that I should consider \"leaving it to God\" amongst other pieces of advice. In the Philippines' subreddit, someone suggested that I go checkout this well-known therapy place. I called and found out theyre all about seeking closeness wiTh God. They even asked me if I wanted to talk to a priest!!! The mere thought of asking for help from a professional is now giving me anxiety because all of the ones I've talked to suggests that I should become more religious. I think they only take the ones that are borderline suicidal seriously. I really just need someone to talk to and possibly get some meds because I've been anxious ever since I can remember.\n\nWhat do I do?",

But today was different! I met up with someone for coffee, and it turned into a very nice date. We played super mario bros and talked about life and ate food. And the whole time I was subconsciously freaking out, I had constant negative thoughts. Like oh no, he's checking his phone, am I being too boring? Or is he talking to someone else? Unnecessary worries. But I got through it, we had a great day, regardless of my anxiety. And I'm so happy. I'm proud of myself.
