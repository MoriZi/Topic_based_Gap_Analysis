It's so debilitating and feels like my insides are being ripped out. I almost always throw up as well. Does anyone else have this?

            "selftext": "Tomorrow I will be exactly 25 and half years old male.\n\nMy parents were drinking a lot when I was young. There was a lot of yelling and hitting. I felt unsafe at school and at home. On the weekends when they were not drinking I felt ok. Not happy, I can\u2019t remember a time when I was actually happy. There was always some kind of a problem, either medical or financial. They had enough money to provide essentials to me and my brothers. They just preferred to spend it on alcohol.\n\nI have a couple of medical problems. Not sure if they were caused by my anxiety and depression or if it was the other way around. I have severe psoriasis on my scalp and in other areas on my body. My gums bleed despite flossing, brushing, rinsing and regular visits to the dentist. As of a week I have lost partial hearing in my left ear. I am pretty sure it is connected to my psoriasis but I have yet to consult a specialist.\n\nI used to enjoy things. I have been very passionate about video games, books, music, TV shows and movies. I thoroughly enjoyed any kind of fiction. I used to come up with the ideas for books, TV shows and movies. Now I enjoy nothing. I have sold almost all of my possessions to have some sort of emergency fund. I have no debts, but since my health is not too well I consider it necessary. I also did it because I did not enjoy them anymore. I have sold all my gadgets. The only things of any value I own are a laptop and a phone.\n\nI have not left the house in almost two years since I have graduated college. Except for the occasional trip to another city to visit my brother. I do not go out since I have no friends. I used to have one female friend. We used to hold hands together and generally talk about everything. But we had some differences and now we do not even talk anymore. I feel kind of indifferent towards females. My sex drive is at all times low. I rarely masturbate. Not because I feel the need to. Simply because I have read somewhere that regular ejaculation prevents prostate cancer. I work out a lot. But there are no gains in muscle mass or confidence. I do it because I feel like I need to, but deep down I feel like it is pointless. Like everything else.\n\nI have not been able to get a full time job for the same amount of time. I had literally two job interviews since I left school. On both occasions I have heard the same thing: That I give of the vibe of someone extremely introverted and shy and that I might not be a good fit for their team. I have been deluding myself that I have some minor translation work going for me but I have not done anything with it for a long time. I might be able to start soon if I get accepted into another company but I will not be making much. I get intense panic attacks in situations which will affect my future. These include job interviews and meetings with new people and old colleagues. I do not think I am a hypochondriac. It prevents me from having the life I want. I cannot afford therapy or medication. Not until I get that good job. It is so bad that I am considering drinking before my next big interview.\n\nI do not know what to do next. They tell me to live but I do not see the point to. Every situation, friendship, relationship feels temporary. Nothing lasts forever. I am terrified of growing old. I am scared of what other medical problems another ten years will bring. I fear being alone for the rest of my life. I am scared of being dependent on others for the rest of my life. But that is exactly what we all are, dependent on our employers and clients. I need advice. Please tell me what else I can do.\n",

            "selftext": "My partner is a lovely, sweet guy, who has been treated badly by his family and his previous partners (emotional/physical abuse) and has developed some intense anxiety around various things. \n\nAt the moment the most significant anxiety is with his job -- it's a fairly low level receptionist role, where he is almost always bored or stressed to some degree. He hates it and it is making his mental health worse. He has had incidents of self-harm and suicidal thoughts because of how much he hates it. But he seems paralyzed when it comes to finding something else, or even considering that he can leave. He is convinced that he hasn't got any skills or  interests worth perusing and that he's just \"stupid\" and that's why he can't figure out how to leave. \n\nI help him as much as I can, talking him down from his worst moments of self-hatred and trying to be present and communicative while also not enabling his spirals. But I can't do everything. I've tried to talk him into seeing a doctor, but the mental health services in our area are shockingly bad and oversubscribed (a wait of 6 months+ for a therapist) and we can't afford to go private. Every time he manages to work himself up to going, he's told that there's nothing they can do and he will have to deal with it. Last September he actually attempted suicide and we tried to get him access to services, but again he was told they can't do anything unless he tries again or is willing to go into hospital. \n\nDespite all of this, he doesn't seem to realise that his anxiety is an illness or that it's even not normal to spend 90% of your time either anxious, miserable or angry. \n\nWhat I think would help would be some literature on recognizing this -- can you recommend a book, an article or something that helped *you* realise what's going on in your head? What do you wish you could have been told to help you manage your anxiety?\n\nThanks in advance. It's great to know this community exists.",

Walking and running, in particular, have been pretty good stress- and expectation-free activities for me; I find that going for a run when I start to feel anxious, and just taking at least one long walk a day, help me stay \"grounded\" or balanced. (Conversely, I am more likely to get \"derailed\" on days when I haven't or can't walk/run.)\n\nHowever, going for a run to alleviate an impending 2 AM anxiety attack is out of the question, so I'm currently in search of a new low-key, no-pressure activity or hobby to engage in when anxiety strikes in the wee hours. Calligraphy, maybe, or origami or something.\n\nAnd that got me to wondering: **Do you also have a \"stabilizing\" hobby of sorts?**\n\n**How did you get into it, and how do you sustain it? And are there specific ways in which it has helped you manage your anxiety?**",
