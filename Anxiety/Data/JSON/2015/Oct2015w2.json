Like I have some major embarrassing moments in the past (social fuck-ups, bullying, even small things like a minor stutter, or failing to maintain conversation with a girl during a phonecall, etc).\n\nThese moments, both big and small, haunt me. Something I can go a few days without really being bothered, other days i'm just overcome with emotion about how awful a memory that was, to the point that i'm reliving it in my brain for an entire hour, wondering how I could have done it differently to avert such psychological trash. You just feel like screaming because of how the memory feels. Doing totally unrelated things seem to spark these moments too.\n\nI feel like it's never going to get better, it's almost like the main driving force of my depression and social anxiety.

            "selftext": "Hello all. Yesterday I had my 4 month check up with my doc, and it has been amazing what a difference being on meds (Lexapro) has made in my life.\n\nBack in June I was diagnosed with GAD and depression. I was a nervous wreck working a high stress job and it finally got to me. I had a nervous breakdown at work and decided right then I was done and needed to finally seek help. \n\nI have been on Lexapro since June and my life is a complete 180 from where it was. My anxiety levels are super low if even non-existent. If a problem arises instead of fearing for the worst, I can now calmly work things out. I don't lay awake in bed all night worrying about what the night day might bring. Socially I'm also way more open to people now (not that I was a shut in by any means). \n\nSo if you're on the fence about seeking help or currently silently struggling please MAKE THE CALL and get help! You will thank yourself everyday for it later when the positive changes start taking place. ",

I think about my heart all the time, every single thing I put in my body worries me if it's unhealthy. I obsess over taking supplements like fish oil to keep my heart healthy and drink lots of green tea. \n\nI exercise regularly, doing both heavy lifting and recently started doing more cardio. In school, while having presentations, I always feel like I'm gonna get so stressed out that I'm gonna have a heart attack. When I go to places, I always look around and wonder what will happen if I have a heart attack. \n\nWill I die here on this mountain top? Will the ambulance find me here in the woods? What if I die on this plane? I've been checked up with EKG twice in a year, nothing weird. But still my heart anxiety haunts me everyday and it's killing me. I've tried meditation, acupuncture, therapy and just pushing through. But my fears just reignite. \n\nAnybody got any good tips?",

Last night I hit my limit and couldn't suppress my stress and depression anymore- I erupted in tears and let the hot water loosen my muscles. I turned the water off and just sat in my bathtub- alone, vulnerable- but it was amazing I was letting myself feel emotions for the first time in about 3 months. Sure I'm still in a funk, but it was a nice release. Try it sometime. The next time you feel overwhelmed, take a hot shower, pamper yourself, you and your body deserve it. It's okay to feel- it's okay to not be strong all the time. ",

            "selftext": "The last few days have been strange but rewarding, and I wanted to share the experience because R/anxiety made a big difference in my life. \n\nOn Wednesday, September 30, I had a panic attack. Not a huge shock, as I've been having panic attacks since February of 2014. Unlike previous attacks however, this one came with a single, horrible thought: \"What's the point. You should just give up\". I made my way to an emergency room and stayed there until they felt I was no longer a threat to myself. I felt numb for a few days after that, not sure what would happen when that feeling ended. On Monday I found out. \n\nOn Monday, October 5, I had a panic attack on my way to work. I took Lorazepam but I never felt the effect. The same thought appeared and overpowered everything else. I posted in r/anxiety and a few users were kind enough to offer comfort. It was enough to get me to leave work and go to my psychiatrist. She signed a form which let the hospital hold me up to 72 hours. After spending the night in emergency, I was moved to the hospitals Psychiatric Intensive Care Unit as it was the only part of the ward that had a open bed. The first night, I was terrified. I felt like I was in way over my head. The nurses help me acclimate and made that first night much easier. \n\nThe following morning, a team of psychiatrists and medical students came to begin my assessment. As I spoke to them, I saw the whole chain of events that got me here. A string of panic attacks and medication changes that formed a terrible cycle: One where I would sink into depression, have a panic attack, get my meds changed, feel good for a few months, then sink into a depression and start all over again. After the assessment I sat in my room and thought about my approach. I started writing out ideas and, most importantly, I spent time listening to my anxiety instead of trying to run from it. I don't mean listening to the negative thoughts, so much as the cautious ones. I stopped treating that cautious voice as an enemy, and used it to drown out the negative. By the next day (today), I had a list of small changes I needed to make to break the cycle. After talking with my psychiatrist and the PICU team, we came up with a treatment plan to make sure I didn't make the same mistakes. \n\nI'm writing all of this for two reasons. The first is because I wanted to show that there is a light at the end of the tunnel, even if you're at the point of being placed on suicide watch. The second is because /u/ZexMurphy reminded me that for everything /r/anxiety has given me, I should give back in kind. I love you guys. It may be unorthodox (You should have heard me try to explain reddit to my psychiatrist), but having this open place has meant more to me this last year than I can express. I will do my best to give as much as I take, and hopefully give a whole lot more. \n\ntl;dr - Had suicidal thoughts, but got help thanks to r/anxiety \n\nQuick P.S - The myths I heard about the poor quality of hospital food were greatly over-exaggerated... Apart from the morning I got a off-putting blueberry muffin and a hard boiled egg.\n\nEdit - For reference purposes, here is the post I made on Monday -&gt; https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/3nk58f/its_coming_and_i_dont_know_if_i_can_fight_it/",

            "selftext": "Every day, I commute on a train between San Francisco and the Easy Bay area. The train spends about 8min underwater as it passes under the San Francisco bay, and during that time last Tuesday I experienced my first inescapable panic attack. \n\nThe trains at 8am get packed. By packed, I mean everyone huddles in as closely as possible and you are packed like a bunch of sardines inside of a moving piece of metal. Usually, I can survive these daily rides without incident and move on with my day. But, Tuesday, a mixture of no sleep and work related stress sent me over the edge while packed shoulder to shoulder with 100 other people and I couldn't escape. \n\nI felt the stress slowly rolling over me as we got closer to the tunnel, and as the lights went dark I began to panic. For the first time in my life, there was nowhere to run or hide and it amplified my anxiety. My body had chills, yet felt like it was on fire. I started getting light headed. I began to lose strength in my legs and my stomach turned over. In an underwater tube, in front of 100 people, I collapsed in the corner of packed train and silently held onto the wall while fighting to keep consciousness. \n\nNo one understood what was happening. No one said a word. Everyone stared. \n\nI have never been so horrified in my life. The 8min of terror felt like a life time and it took every ounce of energy I had to stay conscious until the door opened and I pushed my way out of the train on to the subway floor. I ended up having to take a taxi the remainder of the way to work so I could regain what little composure I had left.\n\nAt the end of the day, I had to take the train back home. My stomach was in a knot, my heart was racing, and something that I have done every day for the past year now had turned into a new nightmare. But, I did it. I sat in that train and I took it like a man. Because, I would rather lose my dignity and bowel control than secede what little self respect I have left to an enemy that does not exist.\n\nTL;DR Went on a train with 100 people, had a panic attack and collapsed in a corner, arrived at work and took the train back home. I count this as a win. \n",

            "selftext": "For the past few months, I've basically just felt overall shitty. I've felt kind of down, super insecure (I never used to be this insecure), and it feels like my stomach is in knots 80% of the time. I recently decided to get help because I realized more and more that maybe this isn't something I can control on my own and that I need to talk to someone. \n\nBasically, I've felt my boyfriend getting more and more distant lately. I heard him complain to a friend that things \"aren't going super well\" and that I'm really clingy. This hurt because I know I've been kind of needy lately, but it's because I actually need him. He's one of the few people I trust I can go to when I'm hurting. I want to talk to him and tell him that I'm willing to give him his space, and that it should be better now that I'm getting help, and that he just needs to communicate with me if he needs space, not withdraw. I just can't help thinking that he's going to just break up with me. He's canceled plans on me a few times and won't answer some of my messages (even one that just asked about plans for getting dinner with me and one of my visiting relatives) and I'm afraid he's going to just avoid talking, which is going to make it worse. How do I reach out to him and make him realize that I want to feel like me again and that I'm going to work towards that? I'm just so afraid he doesn't feel the same way about me anymore. He told me this week that he \"loves me a lot\" and I don't know how that would change over the course of a few days but I just can't get it out of my head that he didn't mean it. \n\nEDIT: Thank you so much for all the responses! It's calming to know that people either know what I'm going through or just to hear some kind words. I asked him last night if we were ok, and to tell me if I'm ever too much, and he said that we are and that I've been fine. But I'm still not completely reassured (again, me needing this reassurance probably isn't a healthy thing) but I asked him if we could talk more in depth later, and we are going to do so. I'm going to be calm and mature about it, and just explain the way I've been feeling and how I'm afraid it's affecting our relationship, and ask him what he thinks and what I can do better to make this easier for the both of us. Thanks again for all the responses! ",
