My heart starts racing and I trip over my words. I pace constantly and just I don't make a fool of myself.\nI know it's a completely irrational fear - what is the person on the other end of the phone going to do, really? I'm likely never going to speak to this person again.\nThis fear hinders me. I'm currently sitting on the couch staring at the phone because I know I need to call someone about a job, but I can't make myself do it. This could be an amazing opportunity for me, but this stupid anxiety is holding me back. \ntl;dr I get super anxious about talking on the phone.

            "selftext": "Hi everyone,\n\n\nI posted awhile back on here about quitting caffeine and I did it.  I was a daily coffee drinker, couldn't miss a day - quite addicted. I quit cold turkey and it has been somewhere around 3+ months now.  I wanted to give you all my experience with this as it relates to my anxiety.  First of all, I have had anxiety for as long as I can remember.  Since quitting caffeine, my anxiety levels have gone down tremendously.  Also, I have had sleep problems for years- mostly would have trouble falling asleep; it would take me nearly an hour to finally fall asleep and during that hour I would have racing thoughts and feel as though I couldn't \"turn my mind off\".  Now, I lay down at night, and I'm asleep within 15 minutes... and those racing thoughts? Gone.  I never thought that caffeine could be so incredibly impactful on my daily life- and I had never really thought it was the caffeine triggering my issues.  I thought \"oh, it's just caffeine - it's legal, that's not a significant reason for any of my anxiety issues\"... wrong.  I am so glad I have figured out one of the main triggers for my anxiety after all this time.  I only wish I had quit much sooner.\n\n\nAlso, as an experiment, on Friday I had a regular latte (yes, caffeinated).  Two hours after it, I was sweaty and nervous.  That wore off, but when I went to bed Friday night I could NOT fall asleep for about an hour+ and had the racing thoughts problem.  Coincidence?  I don't think so.\n\n\nAnyway, what I hope you all will take away from this is that if you are taking in caffeine on a regular basis, please please try to take it out of your system completely.  Yes, it is hard.  Caffeine is an addictive drug, and you will feel bad for quite a few weeks before you start feeling better; but, the anxiety (for me) started dissipating within about a week and a half of quitting.",

Red faced, I felt a panic attack coming on, so I said \"Sorry I don't want to hear about this I can't listen to this\" and quickly walked away. Took a pill in the other room and calmed down.\n\nNext day, my husband is just \"letting me know\" that I came across rude. Maybe next time I should excuse myself less dramatically and just something like quietly, \"please excuse me.\"\n\nI explained to him the following:\n1. You do not have the right to attempt to make me feel guilty over the perfectly justifiable actions I took out of self-preservation.\n2. You do not have the right to police my tone. Ever, and especially when I am having an emergency (such as panic attack)\n3. You do not have the right to give me additional things to worry about when I'm already anxious. If this were to happen again, sure I'd be panicking about the thought of vomiting which is my wort nightmare, but NOW I should also think critically about how I'm coming across to others.\n\nHis response: \"well I didn't SAY that you should feel guilty\" and other pedantic drivel.\n\nI fucked off out the door and am just in a lounge area. I am open to your input on this, as it's the nth time that someone has given me crap for having panic attacks and PTSD (the phobia comes from trauma). Thanks for your support.\n\nEDIT: I'd like to clarify that just because I used the term, \"tone policing\" doesn't mean I'm an idiotic \"SJW.\" I saw the safe space episode of South Park and thought it was hilarious. I don't expect people to walk on eggshells around me, but I did think that it was insensitive of him to bring up something as trivial as my tone during a time of acute hardship. \n\nAlso, I do not have panic attacks simply when the word \"vomit\" is uttered-- see, I just typed it. No, this was after an HOUR of these people going into great detail about all the times they threw up, in a graphic way AT THE DINNER TABLE. Why do you assume I've never received therapy? I have PTSD, which is improving each day.\n\nFinal thought: Thanks for the various viewpoints. We worked it out.",

The community here in combination with some awesome individual/DBT therapy has me finally believing that life gets better, shinier, brighter, happier. I can finally picture a future where my fear still exists, but I'm no longer a slave to this anxiety disorder (panic disorder, generalized, and social).\n\nSo I apologize if this post doesn't belong here, or if it's already been said. But I want to let you all know that you've helped me feel less alone. I'm still IN that hard place, just slowly climbing out...so I hope you know you're not alone either. \n\nBut how amazing is it that absolute strangers can come to this little pocket of the internet to sympathize, offer a helping hand, and aid each other in such a difficult fight? \n\nNever change, you guys.

The list of need to do's keep whispering in my head and  I keep finding myself exhausted JUST from listening to them, not even doing anything. The panic attacks are even hitting a bit differently now, the usual overwhelming of emotions and struggle to breathe has turned into complete numbness where I struggle to respond to anyone and just get lost staring into nothing, to where its hard to do anything at all, to even think in those moments. Im not a bad person, I try so very hard, i love people but their neediness hurts, thier emotions that pour out of them and seemingly into me hurt, the obligations they give me hurt, lifes responsibilities hurt.
