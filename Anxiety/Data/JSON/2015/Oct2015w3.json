            "selftext": "I've recently been dealing with depression and with it a little anxiety. I use to be really outgoing around 1 year ago. I use to be have a wanting for adventure. But over the past year I have found comfort in staying at home and not wanting to do anything that wasn't reliable. School, work, and go home, once in a while go to dinner with friends. I didn't have the urge to meet people, it scared me. I thought talking to someone new was a little terrifying and found comfort and safety in it. But yesterday I saw a meetup going for comic books. The entire train ride I was so scarred, my heart pounding, thinking I could just get off this stop and go back home, but I didn't.Once I got in front of the place I couldn't seem to get myself to enter the building. Yet someone saw me, opened the door and said it's cold come on in. I sat down to the meet up, they were already talking and felt left out. After an hour of feeling like a stranger, feeling like the oddone, feeling like if I run out that door I could forget about this, I spoke up.By the end of night, I meet a really nice group of people, walked out with free comics, and have not feel this proud of myself in a long time. A lot of my friends/family don't know about my anxiety and really wanted to share with someone.  Thanks for listening &lt;3 (reading?)",

Just venting/rambling, need to do it somewhere.\n\nBeing vague about exact program because it'd be easy to identify me. I'm in grad school in the medical field right now, for a specific profession. I have realized that I don't want to work in this profession at all. I have anxiety in almost all social situations and working in an intensely interpersonal job like this will destroy me. Even if I did not have anxiety over social situations, I am still a strongly introverted person. It would still be draining. I chose to enter this program when I was a clueless 18 year old who had no idea what I wanted to do in life, so I chose this because I got accepted and it seemed good.\n\nThe only degree I have is a bachelor of science in health science with a minor in psychology, so pretty much useless. Got good grades so at least there's that.\n\nI have lost all motivation for my courses. I hate the courses I'm in, they aren't interesting to me and the amount of memorization involved is sickening when one is not interested in the subjects. If I don't fail out this semester then I will later on for sure, not due to stupidity but due to lack of desire and motivation. I'm not trying to be a downer about that, I'm just being honest with myself for once. I have basically lied to my family and to myself throughout college, hoping naively that my personality would change and that I would come to enjoy it. I stay up all night constantly due to procrastination and anxiety over this realization. I'll have one minor assignment to do and stay up all night over it, every time, because I dislike it so much. Over the past year I have lost enjoyment in everything I do. Nothing makes me happy anymore.\n\nI'm lost. My parents will be crushed over this. I was supposed to have a stable, well respected, and high paying job. Instead I'll have to take anything I can get, despite all that my parents have done for me. I have failed them. I have debt that needs to be paid and I don't know if I'll be able to find an adequate job to pay it. I'm paying rent for an apartment right now until June, if I fail/drop out this semester then paying for the 2nd semester of living here will be a total waste. Not that that matters in the long run, but it's just another thing.\n\nI feel like have lost control of my life and no longer have a career path. My interests are in history and geography, which doesn't help right now, and also computers. Could try to get a job as a lab tech, or something totally unrelated to my degree, and teach myself programming in my spare time like so many people on Reddit seem to have done, but that seems like such a pipe dream. \n\nAnyone been through something like this? Any advice?",

            "selftext": "I started a new job a couple months ago... I should preface this by saying I've always, for some reason, felt anxiety when it comes to having eye contact with people I pass in the hallway. I've never known how long is too long, it's always made me feel awkward, and I'm terrible at small talk, so I don't hold it for a long period of time.\n\nA couple weeks ago, my coworker noticed me not holding eye contact with him. He asked me about it and if I have trouble holding eye contact. I answered that I typically don't... I only do when I pass people in the hallway. \n\nWell fast forward to last week, my supervisor took my unit out to lunch... Everyone was joking, having a nice time. towards the end of the lunch my coworker said 'hey, everytime you pass vballienn in the hallway, make sure and look her DIRECTLY in the eye.'... Suddenly all eyes turned on me and I had to explain myself... I could tell by the way my coworker said it that he was joking, but it really hurt my feeling and has made me bottle up ever since. On top of the eye contact thing, my supervisor told me that I caused 'a panic' bc I assumed my other coworker needed to do training, when in fact he didn't. I was just trying to help a friend of mine and to hear I caused 'a panic' just got to me and made me feel awful. \n\nJust now, my supervisor came to my desk to talk about something ... She ended it with asking 'are you ok? I noticed you're not holding eye contact with me?'\n\nI just wish my coworker had never brought it up to begin with, or that I answered his initial question about me having trouble with eye contact differently ... I'm known for being a jokster and laughing a lot. But this has really gotten to me, but I have to put on a happy face and pretend everything is OK. \n\n",

I've honestly been acting like it never happened and suppressing it hardcore up to this point, but now it's on my mind a lot. It's also opened up a lot of old wounds that I never bothered to heal. My grandpa also raped me from my toddler years up into middle childhood. My cousin also attempted to rape me as a kid, but I manage to escape that one. Lately, I'll be doing anything and the smallest things will trigger me to flashback and go into full on panic attacks. I'm barely able to get through my days. I'm always shakey and out of breath. I barely sleep and when I do, I have terrible dreams and wake up having more anxiety attacks. Yesterday, I couldn't even go to work because I couldn't pull myself together. I feel like I can't trust people  because I've been violated by people that were supposed to be so close to me. I feel like no matter how hard I work to be independent and strong that at any moment anybody could come in and take it all away from me. I know this is all over the place. I just needed to tell someone, I guess. I don't know what to do to get better, but I know I can't stay like this for long. Any suggestions would be helpful. ",

(The fact that they call them Adult Coloring Books makes me lol).\n\nIt seems several of you had great suggestions or wanted to know more about them. For me, they have been a great tool in managing anxiety and keeping me distracted.\n\nI like to use Watercolor Markers, but some people use color pencils or pens. You can also blend different tools to make different effects. It's really whatever you want it to be! You can find these books online or in stores. The two that I'm working from came from Michael's and Books-a-Million.\n\nIf you have a nearby Michael's you might know they almost always have a 40% off one item coupon weekly. You can use this for your markers or pencils!\n\nThe sale this week is pretty good and there are online deals on the Michael's website if you want to have it shipped.\n\nSome people like the super intricate designs while others like the simpler designs. Here are a few photos of the books I'm working from. http://imgur.com/a/MbTDs\n\nOne is watercolor marker and one is color pencil and marker blended. Please add advice, suggestions, and links to this thread and feel free to ask questions!\n",

I feel like my identity has been damaged in some way. I feel very sluggish and out of it. I barely had energy to leave my flat this morning. I feel lonely despite being surrounded by people. I think my mind is broken.\n\nI've just started at university. I have a lot of pressure on me. There are a lot of deadlines coming up. I don't know how to start any of my essays. I don't have some of my required reading books. Some of my books are quite expensive but I have a \u00a3200 gift card from the book shop as a courtesy thing. The pressure is getting so bad I don't think I will pass this year. I am paying \u00a39000 a year for this. I think I am going to fail every module.\n\nI feel very numb and I wish I could cry but even that just feels like too much work for me. I can barely move. I'm the worst person ever.\n\nI'm sorry.",
