            "selftext": "So I have been posting here for years asking for advice on how to fly with panic disorder. I used to have panic attacks almost every day to the point where I didn't like to leave the house. Throughout the last 7 years, I have gotten much better with them and conquered little fears here and there. The one that I had not conquered yet was flying on an airplane. I had built it up to the hugest fear I could imagine. Even thinking about being inside of an airplane made me start panicking. I had a huge fear of being so high up in the sky in this small tube with a bunch of people with NO way out. There was nothing scarier than this to me because obviously when I have a panic attack, I just want out. \n\nI had turned down trips for years and everyone knew I was the 27 year old who has never flown before. The more years that passed, the more the fear grew. I have finally reached a point in my life where I feel like life is just too short and I need to see the country/world. I was offered a chance to go on a work trip this month. It was going to be from LA to Boston. I thought about it for 2 weeks and last minute I said yes. Leading up to the flight there were many sleepless nights, anxiety, and stress. Not only was this a 5.5 hour flight but it was a red eye. Oh, and it was also 9/11. \n\nI walked onto the plane and took my seat. I looked around and immediately started panicking. I couldn't believe how small it was inside the plane and how small the seats were. We didn't even start moving yet and I started having a severe panic attack. I told my boss that I didn't think I could do it and almost got off the plane. Then I thought that I had come this far and I NEED to conquer this fear so I stayed. Take off was the most fear I think I have ever felt in my whole life. I was having a panic attack and I just needed to get out but I had no place to go. I had taken xanax before the flight but it seemed like my adrenaline was overpowering it. After about an hour, the xanax kicked in more and I found myself a little more calm. I tried to distract myself as much as possible and my co workers were amazing at making sure I was okay. \n\nIt was the last hour of the flight and I started getting so happy and excited that I actually did it. I conquered my hugest fear. It was really tough but I actually did it. \n\nThe flight home was a little better because I knew what to expect and I took a little more xanax. I don't think I will ever enjoy or look forward to flying but at least I know now that I can do it. I now feel like I can do anything after going through this. Thank you for reading! I just had to share this story with people who could relate. ",

            "selftext": "Just thought I'd share with the community that always helps me get through panic attacks. I've been on the search for a treatment/cure for the past 4 years (since my panic attacks started) but for some reason, I never drastically changed my diet. I cut out sugars and high-carb foods such as bagels, but I never went crazy. I'm a big meat eater and I assumed chicken was really healthy so I ate mostly chicken for a while. I neglected how many nutrients fruits and veggies have for you.\n\nOh my god, you guys, what a difference. I've been eating just veggies for one meal a day, and at least half veggies/beans for the other two. Snacks between meals: nuts and fruit. I have energy! Not the anxious, \"oh god i'm going to jump out of my skin\" energy, the \"I feel like I could go for a run or be productive today\" energy. \n\nNow, I haven't been perfect. I've eaten some carbs, meat, processed foods, and even a few pieces of chocolate this week. But my main source of energy is coming from carrots, peppers, kale, peas, corn, spinach, tomatoes, avocados, apples, bananas, strawberries, beans, and cashews. I'm so excited I even ordered a juicer that's coming today to supercharge the nutrients sent to my cells.\n\nDiet change is by far the hardest change and it takes the most commitment and it takes a decent amount of prep/cooking, but ultimately it's pretty cheap. I use beans as my main source of protein and it's about a dollar for a can. Add veggies as a side dish and the total comes out to about $3 per meal. \n\nI know I won't be able to stick to this perfectly, but I feel like if I prepare my foods on the weekend and stick to it 80% of the time, I will see a huge improvement in my anxiety. I already have! I haven't had a panic attack all week, which is huge, considering they were daily before. The physical symptoms of anxiety have subsided a considerable amount. Now I just have to work on the psychological barriers of \"I can't do this, I'll have a panic attack\".\n\nAnyways, don't mean to sound preachy or anything, just wanted to share my early success. If you have any questions please let me know!",

But I think about how I would do it and how much easier it would be than carrying on living sometimes. I am always very tempted to start self harming again, for some sort of relief. It is bad that the thought of it is calming? I would hate for someone to see though, which stops me. I wish I could speak this bluntly to my boyfriend - he is so good and caring and always tries to help and encourage me - but when you are depressed and anxious is it hard to see things from their point of view. If I can't get out of bed no amount of \"you have so much to be happy about\" or \"you can do its\" seem to help. I have just come off my meds as I don't want to rely on them but I am finding it hard. My boyfriend says how well he thinks I'm doing without them and how he thinks I don't seem too bad - if he knew what went on in my head he would probably think differently. I don't know what to do anymore. I want to do well and try new things and persue a career I love but my brain stops me. I have no motivation. What is the point.",

            "selftext": "So guys i feel like i cracked the fucking code. Let me calm down..*breath* get it! lol ok so let me start from the beginning. So basically i have terrible anxiety and from time to time i become very depressed. I've been researching my ass off to figure out how can i tame my anxiety and at first i came across mediating which was extremely helpful for me, especially if i want to clear my mind from stress. but mediating didn't stop the anxiety.. So i kept digging..and that's when i ran into the prescription drug modafinil and how it helped for many people. But i'm broke as fuck and i knew that was out of the question. However I got a new sweet job as a school bus driver that i love, so as soon as i get a check that's probably going to be my first purchase. So i was thinking like \"man i need something organic and natural\" so i continue to search and that's when i ran into deep breathing and all it's glory. i read about all the benefits that it came with including brain function and improving blood circulation and it fucking makes sense because i would always breath in and out through my nostrils.. So i'm like ok let me give it a try. I start deep breathing through my nose, hold it for a few seconds, and then gently release from the mouth and actually use my diaphragm  I did it about 10x and guys i shit you not i feel like a new person .. my brain just feel so alive . I can think so clearly and i recall words and information which was always a problem for me ..I don't even post on reddit that much because i would always have trouble remembering words and sentence structure also whenever i was in a social environment like a bar or a club talking to strangers it's always a challenge . Does anybody else who practice deep breathing have the same experience? I know this is something that i have to keep practicing and never stop doing..The same with mediation..I'm just glad i found something that really works for me  ",

I have people who support me, people who put up with me, and people who provide for me. But why do they do it? Because of unconditional love. My family are the only ones who tell me I'm okay, because they are the only ones who has the obligation to care. In reality, I do nothing for them. Because I am incapable, unworthy. I deserve less than I get because I am worth than less I get. They slave away all day to but me the things I need and want, and I don't deserve any of it. Just today my mum asked me to do the dishes, but instead I didn't and instead slept. I am capable of doing it, so why didn't I? I don't know. I couldn't, because that would make sense. So I didn't, and instead chose to do as I always do, and that is nothing. Because I'm so caught up in my own self pity I can't assist the only people who still care enough to tell me I'm worth something. But I'm not. I can't even go to school. I can't even go outside. I can't clean my room, I can't take care of myself so at what point can I take care of others? I can't. I inconvenience all those around me, but I keep telling myself that suicide will be worse to them than what I already inflict.\n\nNo parent should outlive their child, no matter how useless they are. Unconditional love is what drives them to put their life above the ones they foster, even if it is so untrue. They see that I am worth something; to them, I may be. To the rest of the world I'm not. I'm just another self loafing prick, and I don't deserve any of what they give me. I can't put my Grandparents through the same grief. I can't. So what can I do? Nothing. Because I am incapable of helping anybody. I am broken before I have even been created, and my only calling is death. But I can't do that, because for some reason my life extends beyond me. So instead I am forced to live a life that I can't comprehend. I'm stuck in a body of an awful person, and I can't eliminate the pain that causes so much self hatred. Soon, my books and games won't be enough to put my existence in a purgatory state where I can justify my decision to not end my life. Soon I'll have to face the facts. Either live a life where I slave away like that of my parents, and be miserable. Or stay where I am and face the same fate. Either of those is not a life I want to live, so soon I'm going to have to make a decision, and I will most likely make one that cuts away the leeching cancer that is my useless existence. ",

And I have panic attacks up there. People are rude and pushy.\n\nI've always worked in retail since high school and haven't been able to get out. But I always feel like I'm going to have a mental breakdown and just quit on the spot. I adore my coworkers, it's just the people. They treat you so bad.\n\nI'm 23 and seeing about going to school to be an Ultrasound Tech. But until then, I need to make money. Does anybody have any job suggestions? Something without much customer interaction? I just applied for a job in a library a few days ago.",

Now i'm almost 19 and i'm still as bad as I was before. \n\nI don't want to be a NEET, I don't want to leech off my mother until she's forced to kick me out or something. I can leave the house at times but it's inconsistent. I tried doing a 2 week unpaid training thing at a chemist and I fell apart after only a day and a half, apart from that i've never had any other experience.\n\nWhat jobs do you all have and how do you manage to get them? What should I do? \n\nEdit: Thanks for the answers everyone, my goal for this year was to earn a paycheck before 2016. I'm not sure that's going to happen but i'd like to think that i'd be able to manage working at a place where I just see the same few people everyday doing anything that isn't too physical (other medical conditions).",

            "selftext": "I've been seeing my psychiatrist for about six months. Overall I've been pleased with him, but I was disappointed to learn that our \"sessions\" were only related to medication and didn't involve any kind of talk therapy whatsoever. After a couple months I asked if he could refer me to a good therapist in town. He gave me a few names, but none of them accepted my insurance. After trying unsuccessfully on my own to find another therapist, I contacted my insurance company and they gave me a list. \n\nFrom a list of 12 therapists: five never returned my calls, four didn't actually accept my insurance, and two didn't accept ANY insurance. The one woman who was accepting phone calls and new patients was also a psychiatrist. I scheduled an appointment with her. Our first session was yesterday. \n\nI liked her immediately. She is extremely direct and seems very knowledgeable. She disagreed with one of the medications I was put on (trileptal, which I'm really struggling with). She said she'd like to take me on as a patient but that I would obviously need to stop seeing my original psychiatrist. \n\nOf course, I am having an extremely difficult time actually making the phone call. Their respective offices are literally within eyesight of each other. In fact I believe psychiatrist #1 used to work in the same practice that psychiatrist #2 works from. She referred to him by first name while we were talking about him, so I assume that they have at least a professional relationship. \n\nI guess my question is this: since I've only seen this guy for six months, will it look bad to drop him out of the blue? I've never expressed any sort of displeasure with the treatment I'm receiving, but I also haven't had much success, especially with the trileptal. Has anyone had to break up with a doctor? What did you tell the office when you called? Does it seem like I'm making a really dumb decision here? ",

            "selftext": "Hey all. I try to reign in my anxiety as much as I can, but I could do better. I think understanding how it works--and sharing experiences with others--gives you perspective on it. \n\nFor me I think the most apt term to describe it is \"avoidance\". I don't really overthink much (well, I do think quite a bit, but not anxiously), and I don't really dread about the future. I don't worry. I do swimmingly in social situations. But for whatever reason, there will be tasks that I *cannot* do. \n\nFor example, I have a pile of clean clothes on my bed right now. What I should do is put them away where they belong. Every day for the past week I have neglected to do it. Not because I forgot. But because I have a HUGE mental block about doing it. In the moment when I am experiencing the anxiety, putting my clothes away would be akin to asking me to shoot myself with a gun or jump off a building. My body *literally* feels as though it's the worst thing possible and I should avoid it at all costs. This is of course at dissonance with my conscious mind; putting away clothes isn't that bad. It'd be relieving to have them put away finally instead of carting them from the bed to my computer chair every night. But here we are. \n\nWhat's weird is that the tasks I feel this way about will change over time, coming and going. They range from the mundane (putting clothes away, making a phone call, going to the store) to vital tasks (work, school, medical care). Often it gets to the point where I do the things I need to only because I perceive the consequence of not doing it (ie, becoming unemployed) as outweighing the intangible \"badness\" I feel about doing the task. Unfortunately some things never reach this threshold, as their consequences never seem immediate or imminent. (RIP my middle 2 years of college).  Of course some days I don't have these problems at all and I'm utterly bewildered as to why it was ever an issue. \n\nWhat's your anxiety like? Is there anyone out there like me? (If you beat it, or have more info on it, I'd love to know). ",
