            "selftext": "All my life, I've been a vivid nightly dreamer. Also, since adolescence, I've dealt with anxiety in many forms, but primarily in the form of social anxiety. In fact, my social anxiety was so bad that in some situations it felt like it became full fledged paranoia.\n\nAs I've grown older, I've learned to manage it, and just through life, it has become less intense, or at least less frequent, but I still deal with it.\n\nSo I had a dream one night maybe a year or so ago. I was at a huge outdoor party (similar to what I may have been at in high school/college, and a situation that was a major anxiety trigger for me). Literally almost everyone I've ever known is at this party, and many that I don't as well. The anxiety is so intense, it's like an eerie paranoia, weaved into every molecule of the air around me. I watch people form into smaller groups of naturally flowing conversation, sitting together in the grass, or standing in circles,while I stand there alone, feeling so weird and uncomfortable in my own skin. Every fiber of my being...on alert...feeling weird on a universal level...as intensely anxious as it gets, to the point you feel it goes beyond something comfortably labeled 'anxiety' and into an unknown mental realm of a possible disorder, or worse, on a grand scale (of note, I tried psychedelics such as lsd and ecstasy a fair amount of times in high school/college, and it sometimes seemed to intensify my anxiety, so I have in real life had this intense anxious, paranoid experience in a large social setting before, it wasn't just invented in the dream).\n\nOf course, in this dream I also see my wife blending right in to the social flow, so effortlessly, and I feel so much more isolated, even from her. Its like they can all hear some grand music being played at a frequency I just can't detect.\n\nSo in this permeating sense of uncomfortable-ness, I wandered to the fringes of the party, slightly down a grassy hill, and see a guy busy on his own, who looks confident, free from the sense of what I'm feeling. He approaches me and I feel drawn to him, and I don't remember if I verbally expressed my feelings to him or he just knew, but he understood me. He showed me that he was working in a garden on the hillside, and he kept reinforcing to me...just 'tend to your own garden'. \n\nAnd I understood what he meant.\n\nHe was telling me to keep my mind not focused on the minds of all these other people, not the whole perimeter of the party. But not to focus deep in my own head either. Keep my attention focused in the immediate area around me, on myself but not in myself, and mind to this own immediate area of myself and what I was doing.\n\nAnd we started talking, just me and him, and I'm just focused on my immediate area around me, the conversation I'm having with him, but not beyond that. Not into his head about how he is perceiving me, not into what anyone else was doing or thinking. Just tending to my little garden. \n\nNext thing I knew we had walked, almost unnoticed to my attention, back into the party. People were around us again, but I was relaxed. We were sitting near others, I was even conversating briefly with a few other people who had ended up near us, and I was relaxed, comfortable in myself, not worrying what anyone else was thinking or doing. Tending to my garden. Mine only, and not everyone else's, as I typically would. \n\nI remember my wife approaching, the group growing larger, and still feeling relaxed. Comfortable in myself. When my wife was closer, I proclaimed how I loved this guy that I had met, how he was awesome, and I said it aloud with out repercussion, suddenly finding myself acting in the natural flow like everyone else. \n\nI had this profound sense of gratefulness for having met this guy, who had understood my problems and taught me what I needed to know to change them.\n\nWhen I awoke, the feeling of gratefulness and confidence and satisfaction was still there. The dream stuck with me - it stands out as one of those dreams that is so vivid, so real when compared to a typical dream, that the experience feels maybe even more real than real life. And the more I thought about it, the more I realized that the guy I met looked very much like myself.\n\nSo now I'm in my mid 30s, living in a new city where I haven't really made any real friends of my own yet, and I took a day to myself to spend downtown. Normally, now at my age, I'm confident and enjoy doing things by myself. But I guess the thought of not having friends got to me in this place. I did smoke some weed before I left my house, which may have enhanced the situation, but after taking the train downtown, surrounded by people who were mostly not alone, this anxious feeling creeped back in. As night fell, I'm walking down a busy street, and I feel it swarming over me, the anxiety, the paranoia, the weirdness and isolation amongst all these people.\n\nThen I remembered my dream. 'Just tend to my own garden.' And it changed my perspective immediately. Instead of letting my mind jump to focus on whatever or whomever I saw, I kept it to myself. I focused on what I was doing, where I was going, what I wanted, etc, and it worked. I enjoyed the rest of my night, staying busy and enjoying myself for several more hours before going home, when I could have easily packed it in.\n\nSo I thought I'd share in the hopes that this experience may be beneficial to someone else.",

            "selftext": "I've been having panic attacks / panic anxiety / social anxiety for about 6 years. It started when I was 18 and went through depression that led to a break up and a visit to the psychiatrist that threw me on some anti-depressants. \n\nWhen I felt better and forgot to eat my meds I started to get anxiety attacks in public places. Which has made most of my life in public places a living hell.\n\nSymptoms included, problems breathing, shaky hands, tunnel vision, negative thoughts and mental imagery, feelings of disconnect from reality, fear of going insane, fear of hurting someone, fear of fucking up, problems sleeping, feelings of shame.\n\nWell, this week is the first time since then that I've felt normal.\n\nHere's a couple things that I believe might have helped me reached this place.\n\n* Self knowledge. Therapy, self-help books (power of now), philosohopy (freedomainradio)\n* meditation (check out the headspace app)\n* Quit drinking\n* Switched to vaping from cigarettes\n* Excercise ( lowers stress and inflammation )\n* Sauna ( lowers stress and inflammation )\n* Quit Coffee\n* Probiotics ( fixes your gut feelings )\n* Fixed my bad relationship with my dad\n* edit: also cold showers\n* edit2: Sleep is very important for flushing out the grey matter in your brain and feeling well. If you are stressing out at work, grab a nap 20 minute nap when you come home aswell.\n\nAnd the last piece of the puzzle was... carbohydrates.\n\nNow I only eat boiled eggs for breakfast and it really calmed me down. The first day I felt like I was drunk off my ass, my brain was craving the sugars, as carbohydrates are converted to sugars in the body, the whole day I was at work, shit was just going wrong all over the place.\n\nBut the next day. I felt like superman. It was like a calm after a storm, the wind had stopped blowing. The bonus is, I've been having bad acne from my teens til today and It's also starting to fade.\n\nFinally, what is crucial in all of this is that you modify something in your life and keep checking what works, keep going out there with a new method.\n\nAnyway I just wanted to share my success and I feel like I've learned alot from these six years about my condition. I tried to keep this short but If you wanna ask something go ahead, Id love to help someone find the way out.",

I couldn't focus; I felt antsy; I was shaking; my breathing was haphazard; I just wanted to go into a quiet corner and be left alone. My stomach started to ache so badly to the point I started to gag. I went outside on an empty patch of grass and threw up three times.\n\nI felt so debilitated. Even afterwards, my coworkers gave me water and a blanket to rest for a bit. I still shook, and any light, noise or interactions made me feel woozy.

One specific example that runs in my head is yesterday me and my friend decided to go driving so we can just talk. I decided screw it let's go to this trampoline world and have some fun. While i was on the way to the place (30 minutes away), I was kind of getting a little panicky and decided to not go because of anxiety. This isn't even a mild case, I've done this so many times that I can't even think about other cases What baffles me is that anxiety controls my life so much that I'm not thinking what will generate anxiety, as I'm mainly purposefully making decisions based off of anxiety.\n\nThis post may not make much sense but for the past couple of days, I've been in such a depressive state that nothing makes sense anymore. If I could get some guidance and perspective that would be amazing, because I don't know what the next step is. I get anxious even thinking that you guys are reading this and I feel so tempted to just delete everything and live in fear. Ill try my best to provide info if needed. Thanks.\n\nEDIT: One more example that this has impacted my life is that I can't even get the courage to take some blood tests for me because of high blood pressure as an 18 year old. I'm actually pretty healthy(I swim 5x a week and lift 5x a week) but that is one example that my decision making is based on anxiety.",
