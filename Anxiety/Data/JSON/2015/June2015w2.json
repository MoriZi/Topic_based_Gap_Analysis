They come and go, and eventually, you learn the signs to know when to expect them. Sometimes they turn into thunderstorms and become a little more uncomfortable. Sometimes they may even spawn a tornado. But after a little while, they pass and it's over. \nI don't know why I'm holding onto this but it's really helped me.

I failed a communications class in college because I had to run out of the room to vomit in the middle of my speech. \n\nOver the years, it has gradually gotten easier, but it was still a struggle, and any time I had to speak in front of more than two or three people, my face would be on fire and my voice would shake. \n\nTwo weeks ago, my manager asked for volunteers to present during an important meeting with high level executives. As scary as it sounded to me, I feel like I need to start stepping out of my comfort zone if I want to move up in my career. I volunteered.\n\nI had help creating the presentation, and met with my manager and ran it through with my husband to make sure I was fully prepared. I delivered my presentation this morning to a room full of people, including high level executives, including the president of our business segment.\n\nI did great! I was nervous leading up to it (which led to me spilling my coffee all over a co-worker and then running to the bathroom to cry because I felt so bad), but when it was time to get up there, I was confident, poised, and completely prepared. I spoke clearly (I have issues with projecting my voice and I tend to speak very quietly), didn't stumble over my words, and my hands were steady as a rock. I got compliments from all the higher-ups, and I feel so great about it.\n\nI wanted to share this story with all of you, because I never thought I'd be able to do this without passing out or worse. But I did it, and I did it well, and I feel so positive about future public speaking.\n\nYay!",

            "selftext": "As the title says there is nothing wrong with you and it never was. Your body works just as it should if there was a danger at hand. The limbic system initiates the fight/flight response if it thinks you are in danger, and it cant tell the difference between a real danger and a made up one. The limbic system makes conclusions from how you behave and respond to different things. If you are avoiding normal activities the limbic system will observe and conclude there is a danger thus initiating the fight/flight response. If you constantly think there is something wrong with you and you search for an exit the limbic system concludes that there is a problem and initiates the fight/flight response. Stop using avoidance techniques and stop thinking there is something wrong with you, there is nothing wrong with you it never was. Anxiety should be called protection circle as it is just your body trying to protect you. Dont be afraid of the symptons, as it is the bodys way of getting ready to fight/flight. Even when you throw up it is a way to make you lighter to move faster. So you accept that there is nothing wrong with you, now what? The nice thing is that the limbic system reprogramms itself. You need to do the things you have been avoiding, you need to act normal when you feel anxious. You need to live your life like a person that never was trapped in this protection circle. When you act normal even tho you are anxious the limbic system concludes that there is no problem and initiates the rest/digest response instead. The limbic system will reprogramm, it wont happen over night. It will steadily get better, and eventually the rest/digest response will be initiated most of the time. It might be hard to act normal when you feel anxious, remember that the limbic system always observes what you do. It will conclude that there is no danger when you act normal when feeling anxious. Remember there is nothing wrong with you, it never was.\n\n\n\nEdit : Bit more explained.\n\nWhat occurs in an anxiety disorder is the following:\u00a0\n\n1) You use avoidance techniques\n\n2) Your Limbic System has access to your senses.\n\n3) It watches you perform an avoidance action in response to a fear sensation/symptom.\n\n4) It concludes there must be a danger purely by analyzing your actions/choices.\n\n5) It initiates the fight/flight response to keep you safe.\n\n6) You feel the fear it produces.\n\n7) You use avoidance techniques.\n\n\nIn other words you create the disorder by avoiding perfectly normal and healthy bodily functions. If you keep avoiding, the Limbic System concludes that there must be a disorder, and it keeps you on alert!!!!\n\n\nWhat happens in anxiety removal is the following:\n\n\n1) You do not avoid or escape, instead you understand that the fear not required and you do not react regardless of the presence of the fear sensation/symptom\n\n2) Your Limbic System has access to your senses.\n\n3) It watches you not reacting in relation to your fear sensation/symptom\n\n4) It\u00a0concludes that there is no danger.\n\n5) It initiates the rest digest response\n\n6) You feel the relaxation it produces.\n\n7) You no longer feel compelled to avoid or escape.\n\nStop Avoiding.\n\n\n",

In theory I'm going to break it up at first taking out the bottom questions where people gave input (so I can go through those without feeling rushed so much) and will post the majority of the results later today sometime - again fingers and toes here people :)    \nThe bottom part of the survey I intend on sorting though, reading everyone's suggestions &amp; thoughts and making an attempt to then create another graph that represents that information. Sssooo here we go - wish me luck hah :)    I have no clue why I'm so nervous about this I hope it comes out well!!    \n\nri0t\n     \n--------------------------------------------------   \n\n~~##Greetings my wonderful /r/Anxiety peeps~~   \n\n~~Back in 2012 a user posted up a survey and a good number of people participated - the results can be **[viewed here](http://i.imgur.com/CPb6p.png)** for anybody interested. It's been a while so I thought it might be nice to do this again, with a few alterations to the previous one posted. I figure I'll keep it up a few weeks and then post the results - maybe even do a side by side compare if anybody would be interested in seeing that.~~    \n\n~~[I've de-actived form but if you want to look here you go](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1BaWY8eQD2_cxM0DNBEOw0IQc_eAB0fkjrjGiA22GOfg/viewform)~~   \n\n## So pretty please go take the survey - and at the bottom if you could give your thoughts/suggestions it would be much appreciated!! If you have suggestions of questions to add to the form please reply to this post, or pm me, /u/ri0tnrrd\n\n##Thanks :)\n\n#ri0t\n\n######(edited for formatting)",

            "selftext": "When I was a kid, I drank Mountain Dew a lot. Too much actually. I wish I hadn't as it's terrible for your health. I felt amazing when I drank it, but I am now 26 years old, and over the last 3 years I have developed an extreme sensitivity to caffeine. I now get absolutely zero of the side effects people drink it for. Instead, I am filled with the sense of an impending doom. I feel like the ship is going under and I have one last breath to savor. It gnaws at that spot, just below the solar plexus.  It fills my head with terrible thoughts. \n\nA few weeks ago, the person I wanted to spend the rest of my life with broke up with me. To say that I was and am devastated wouldn't do the feeling justice. I have been absolutely miserable. Coincidentally, I had quit caffeine just beforehand. It is one of the best decisions I have ever made. I believe I would be unable to function if I would have continued drinking caffeine.\n\nI went on quite the bender this weekend to try to distract from my broken heart. Walking into work this morning was difficult. I had a very important meeting with our CEOs wife and his right hand. I had to have caffeine, even knowing what was going to happen. I had a quarter of a cup of black coffee. More than enough to set things in motion. I felt a little better half way through the meeting. Cheerful even.  That feeling was quickly replaced with intense anxiety. It hasn't been this bad since last time I drank caffeine, even with my life crumbling around me. \n\nI can never go back to that. I still have anxiety, and I try to deal with it, but when I was addicted to caffeine, it was on a whole other level. ",

What drives me nuts is that my most predictable panic attacks occur after the fact.\n\nToday, my younger brother (16) had a big dance performance at our local city theater. He rocked it and I couldn't be more proud of him. I was so amped sitting there watching him shake it like the proverbial polaroid photograph.\n\nAfter his performance, my family decided to go and celebrate at our favorite restaurant. We ate, talked, laughed, and celebrated, and my brother went to bed smiling. All in all, it was a great day. I powered through a nice steak and mashed potatoes and went to bed full.\n\nAnd, 3 hours later, I woke up shaking, sweating bullets, and just about to revisit that $30 filet mignon. I'm waiting on my xanax to kick in and occupying my mind by contributing and commenting in some of this sub's other threads. I'm not terribly panicked, just sick (that's how my episodes always are) and unsurprised. After a big, stressful day - even if it's a good-stressful like going to a big show - I can almost count on waking up later that night shaking like a spastic colon, WITH a spastic colon, cold sweats, and nearly puking up my toenails.",

            "selftext": "Some background- I have depression, generalized anxiety, and social anxiety disorder.  I'm 21 and live on my own with my boyfriend, but my parents pay for my rent.  I live in a different state than them.  \nMy parents, my mom in particular have very high expectations for me.  They're pretty wealthy/successful, and I often get the impression that my main purpose in life in their eyes is to give them something to brag about.  When I was in elementary school, they would scold me for getting an A- instead of an A+, etc.  They constantly told me that I was lucky to be their kid.  Things like that I guess.  \nAnyway, My mom recently came to visit my apartment and ended up going in my bathroom for a few minutes.  I didn't know she'd be coming so I didn't really have time to tidy up, and I didn't really want her going in there in the first place- I knew it was messy and I was embarrassed.  She didn't say anything about it so I was relieved and figured I was just being too hard on myself.  But yesterday (a week later) she sent me a long email ranting about how I needed to clean my bathroom and that I should be ashamed, it's gross, how could I let anyone see it that way, my living state is the reason i have mental health issues, etc etc.  It made me feel humiliated and disgusting.  My apartment is honestly not that bad; it's probably cleaner than all of my friends'. It's very VERY difficult for me to gather the motivation to clean however because of mental health problems, and it's something that really gets me down every day.   \nBUT HERE'S THE BIG PART that's bothering me now.  I was reminded that a year ago, I was at my parents' home looking for something in their bedroom.  I ended up stumbling upon my mom's diary (invasion of privacy, i know, I shouldn't have) and flipped through it.  It was FILLED with pages and pages of negative things about me. It talked about how she didn't want me to come home because I was too depressing to be around, that I was a know-it-all, that I looked terrible and sick (I had lost 20 pounds because of a multiple-year-long IBS flareup), and just dozens of other things.  Just big long negative entries about me.  This entire journal was seriously just talking about things she dislikes about me and I don't think anything has ever made me feel worse in my life. But now I can't stop thinking about it- I feel like the harsh judgements I put upon myself are all true because of this.  I feel like a worthless disappointment and failure.  I just wish I never saw this and I don't know how I can ever get over it because it's certainly not something I can ever discuss with either of my parents.  Idk\n",

Now that thing is going to happen to me.\"  Even someone saying drive safe or Goodbye to me gets me anxious since I feel like something bad could happen. I know some of these thoughts are un-logical but sometimes they have happen to me in the past which kinda makes me nervous. How do I remind myself that there is no such things as jinxes or evil supernatural voodoo. ",

Seeing as I've only started having these symptoms recently, maybe 2 months now, I like to think that they are right and that it's going to be okay.\n\nBut at the same time, I can't take my mind off of it, and every time I notice that I'm dizzy or confused it gets worse and I start getting really scared. I try everything I can to calm myself down (Concentrating on breathing, relaxing my muscles, thinking to myself and breaking in my head down what's going on) and occasionally it will work, but other times I get floods of panic where I feel so alone and that no one understand what I'm going through and I start to worry that it's driving me mad and it will affect me long term.\n\nMy mum is on anti depressants and she says that she wouldn't recommend them at my age, and this scares me even more because I'm so terrified of the doctors not being able to help me. \n\nI don't really know what I'm expecting from this post, but anyone who can just tell me that I won't be this way forever and that I will be okay, I would appreciate it a lot. I'm scared I'm going to do something stupid while I'm having an attack...",
