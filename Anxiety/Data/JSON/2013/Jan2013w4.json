At 1:00 am, I took a 1mg risperidone (that I was prescribed a long time ago - I'm not on any meds now) to help me sleep. At 1:30, I was playing Skyrim, when the worst panic attack I've ever had began. I became so dissociated that I wondered whether or not I even existed. I figured \"I think, therefore I am\", but still felt really dissociated. I went outside for a smoke. The nicotine helped with the dissociation, but when I got back in I started to have full blown panic - the worst I've ever had. I tried to call a crisis hotline, but the only phone I have access to can't receive calls, and this was one of those stupid hotlines that has to call you back. I wrote down some of the things stressing me out (this always seems to help), and by 2:30 I was feeling mostly normal after watching some Futurama for a bit.\n\nWhat the hell was that? I've never been that dissociated before - even on dissociative drugs!\n\nI called my doctor and set an appointment for Monday. I'm getting back on some meds - I can't handle this anymore.",

A month later, I had lost 30 pounds, and was finally diagnosed with anxiety attacks. I started taking some meds, and it took a while but I found some that worked for me. I started changing my habits, eating right, exercising more, finding ways to de-stress, and stopped pushing myself so hard in so many different directions. Today, the anxiety isn't gone, but it's a world of difference from 4 years ago. I'm better. Still taking meds, though a lower dosage, and my wife has been amazingly supportive, even though I'm sure she can't totally understand what I'm going through. She is my hero for the way she had to basically be a single mother while I was getting the help I needed, and she never complained once, though I could see the hurt in her eyes. \n\nI'm writing this because I want you to know that while you are in the midst of struggling with anxiety, it can feel like a pit you can't get out of.

I've had anxiety since high school (26 now) and it's been well under control for several years -- just half-yearly checks with my psychiatrist, and a pretty low dosage of an SSRI.\n\nAnd then about 2 weeks ago my husband and I adopted a dog.  And there's seriously nothing wrong with the dog.  He is a housebroken, 10 month old terrier mix.  He loves to sit in your lap and go on walks and squeak his toys.  Ever since we got him, I have been a wreck -- crying randomly (even in public, which is *really* embarrassing), unable to eat, upset stomach, insomnia, all of it.  Whenever I look at him I start to feel anxious and sick.  I wake up in the middle of the night when he's in his crate (asleep) thinking \"What if he has to go out? What if he goes to the bathroom?  What if he's sad?\".  He peed on a blanket yesterday night and I shook for hours.\n\nEveryone tells me that it's a transition to go from no-pets to having a pet.  I understand this, but I feel like I can't function.  I don't even want to get out of bed in the morning.  My husband says that the problem is with me, not the dog, and I agreed to get a dog so I have to live with my decision, but all I want is for the dog to be gone.  But I don't even want to go home because the dog is waiting there for me, behaving perfectly, and my entire response is irrational but I feel like I'm trapped in this situation and I'm panicking.\n\nAny suggestions on how to approach this situation?\n\n**TL;DR: husband and I got a new dog, and now I can't function.**  ",

It took four days for us to be using the sink at the same time...\n\nWell, yesterday I had a really bad anxiety attack. The Patriots game was on at 6:30, and I planned on watching it in this common room at my college. I walked past the common room at 6:30 and saw 6 or 7 kids I did not know. I froze, turned, and went to my room to read. I've done this many times before in my college career, just kind of hiding in my room after getting really anxious. But this time, I decided I needed to tell someone how I felt. I texted my girlfriend and sort of hinted at it, saying \"Yeah, I was going to watch the game in the common room. I was nervous.\"\n\nIt took just that for her to understand what I meant. It helps, of course, that she knows me very well and dealt with some anxiety like this herself, but I'm sure any of your close friends could tell that you needed help if you just hinted at it. She came over, we watched a movie, I only spoke about my anxiety for about two minutes, but I now feel 100 times calmer and \"normal.\" So if you're like me, and just trudge through anxiety by yourself, tell someone.

How do I run away from my thoughts? How do I forgive myself? I feel I cannot physically do anything, I am too anxious to do ANYTHING. It's like what is the point in trying to better myself when everyone who has ever met me thinks I'm an idiot. \n\nI wish there was a way I could forget, but everyday I remember more, I cannot believe I behaved the way I did without second thought. I feel desperate for death. Does anyone have any advice, is there anyway I can move on.. I cannot imagine there is.. But I thought I would try.",

            "selftext": "I recently posted here about what I thought was me having a weird reaction to a new medication (clonazepam), but my therapist helped me find the real catalyst, so that's no longer really an issue.\n\nI'm writing this post for a different reason. I've dealt with anxiety my entire life to varying degrees, but I grew up with a severely manic depressive mother and, in my eyes, if my symptoms weren't as severe as hers, I was doing fine and was not diagnosable or ill. I was just overreacting. I was just taking longer than most other people to develop coping mechanisms. \n\nIn a sense, I felt that I didn't *deserve* diagnosis, treatment, or medication for something that was essentially meaningless compared to people with \"real\" disorders.\n\nI was wondering how many of you have had your anxiety reach so far as to make you feel that you don't deserve to be diagnosed as having an actual disorder. Is this common? \n\nMy recent breakdown has been a long time coming because I've been over-analyzing everything and harshly judging myself since I was old enough to understand what it meant to be deficient and unaware. As soon as I saw a therapist, he immediately recognized what I was suffering from. Before I even had a chance to tell him, he told me that he was aware that I would have obsessively researched mental disorders and that, while I may have more knowledge of the subject than the average person, I was in no way qualified to decide whether or not I had a diagnosable disorder. He confirmed that I was absolutely suffering from an anxiety disorder, that it had very clearly been impacting my life for many years, and that I deserved help. That was extremely freeing for me -- to know that I deserved diagnosis and treatment and that I wasn't overreacting.\n\nAlso, have any of you ever felt intense guilt for having to take off of work due to your disorder? Personally, I'm terrified that my co-workers think that I'm overreacting and being lazy, which contributes to the anxiety I feel about returning to work. \n\nSo... Has anyone had similar experiences?

I visited my family doctor who refused to prescribe me anything besides Klonopin, which I still have but only take for emergencies (maybe twice a month). Referred me to a psychiatrist who wanted to make me wait 4 months for an appointment, so went to therapy instead. Helped slightly for awhile, quit going, and now things are flaring up again. I'm getting ready to graduate from college and start graduate school in the fall and it's been stressing me out so my symptoms have been returning.\n\nI have terrible health anxiety. I worry a lot about my heart, because my anxiety manifests physically as chest and back pain. I have had EKGs done and an ultrasound of my heart and been given a clear, but still worry about it sometimes. Now I've been having a dull pain for two months in my left abdomen/part of my back and am terrified of what it may be. I can't live like this anymore, constantly being in fear of every bodily sensation I feel and dwelling on it to the point that I make it unbearable. \n\nI'm going back to the doctor on Friday. When I asked her about medication for anxiety in the first place, I was hoping she'd prescribe me an antidepressant. I was 18 at the time and she didn't want to. Maybe now that I'm almost 22 she'll let me try. I guess this is half-rant, and mostly me wanting to know if anyone has had success dealing with health anxiety while on antidepressants? I'm also seeing the counselor at my college once a week, and plan on continuing to do so if/when I'm prescribed a long-term medication. ",
