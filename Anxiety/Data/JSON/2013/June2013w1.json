I haven't been in here for a while, and I apologize, but my emotional state and anxiety have been a little high for me to come in here. Ridiculous, I know, but that's how it's been.\n\nI really wanted to share with you something positive that feels like a huge accomplishment in my battle against anxiety.\n\nToday is a very very stressful day, and I'm having a huge anxiety attack over it, but I'm somehow managing pretty well.\n\nSo this morning, while panicking about the events yet to unfold today, I receive a phone call informing me about an appointment tomorrow that I didn't know I had. I already have two medical appointments tomorrow and there's no way I can make it, so I reschedule.\n\nI had an idea of what the test was supposed to be, but no one informed me of the whole details. The man on the phone goes over the details with me and once done he asks me if I still want to go through with it. This test is going to be a nightmare. Both physically and emotionally, and most people tend to back out when they hear the whole details.\n\nI've had severe stomach issues for most of my life, so even though I absolutely do **not** want to go through with this nightmare of a test, I tell him that yes, I'll do it. Because if there's even a tiny chance that it reveals what's wrong with my stomach and leads me in the direction of healing, it'll be worth it.\n\nHe asks me if there's anything he can do for me and if I have any questions. I feel my voice catch in my throat. I know what I want to ask, but I feel like I can't. I feel like I'll be laughed at. I struggle, but I bite the bullet and explain about my anxiety and about how my cat is a great emotional support animal [we've started taking him to my medical appointments and my fiance and him camp out in the car while I'm having testing done].\n\nI haven't registered him as an emotional support animal yet [you don't have to have the prescription to register them, but some institutions will ask to see the prescription in addition to his registration papers, I've heard and read] and I don't have a prescription for him yet because psychiatrists are in high demand in my area and I still have yet to find one I can go to.\n\nIt turns out that the man that had called me about my appointment was the director of radiology himself.\n\nHe tells me that yes, I can bring my cat in, and he'll put it in my file and let the radiologist know about it. And if *anyone* gives me *any* trouble about having Nova [my cat] with me, to call him [he then gave me his *personal* cell phone number] and he'll set things straight real fast.\n\nHe *also* told me that if I'm *ever* in radiology [even if it's during an emergency room visit] that Nova is welcome to come in with me and again, if anyone ever gives me any trouble about having him in radiology, to call his personal cell phone [at any hour, night or day] and he'll take care of it.\n\nI started crying like an idiot while on the phone with him, thanking him over and over and over again.\n\nSo even though the events of today are still causing severe panic, my panic had been lightened somewhat by the conversation I had about this nightmare of a medical test I'm gonna have to go through.\n\nThe fact that Nova is being allowed into radiology with me [I'm not going to let him be in the room when the machine is actually running, my fiance will be taking him from the room when the machines are on] and will be allowed to comfort me between images being taken, is a huge deal to me. It feels like someone has taken a fifty pound weight off my shoulders.\n\n**Update:** Today didn't end up as badly as we [myself and my fiance] were afraid it would. It was a really huge relief and overall we walked away unscathed.\n\nI'm also still excited [not looking *forward to it*, I'm very emotional but not upset over it] about the phone call this post is about.",

I've been talking with a therapist for months.)  \nI (19f) have a fantastic boyfriend (21m) who would do anything for me, loves me, even thinks I'm somewhat cute when I go all neurotic on him (he says I'm sweet-crazy!). We've been together two months and everything is perfect.  \nWe had a talk yesterday, when he made a joke of being single again, about our potential breakup and he said what I was feeling: Considering our ages, chances are we will break up at some point but we hope to be together for a long time, and if that ends up being forever then that's great. This, logically, is exactly how I feel about the situation, and the fact that he agrees completely couldn't be more amazing.  \nUnfortunately I've had a string of bad relationships in the past that have all included the guy getting tired of me and leaving me for someone else/becoming unattracted to me. Needless to say, since these are my only other relationship experiences, this pattern is somewhat ingrained in my head and, now that we've talked about our potential breakup, I feel like a switch has been flipped and now I can't enjoy the relationship **now** because I'm hyperaware of the breakup. He didn't write back for a few hours? He's getting tired of me.  I already want to hide the things that he's got at my house so I don't think of him if we do break up. My head is in perpetual what-if mode, a very dangerous place for me to be.   \nI realize I can't control the future and should just be here now, because we're young and in love, but my anxiety doesn't realize that and  \nwon't  \nSHUT  \n**UP.**  \nIf anyone has any advice as to how I can chill my brain out, I thank you in advance. I just want consistency. I'm tired of heartbreak.  \n**TL;DR:** I have the perfect relationship right now but the realization that we will probably break up is ruining it for me. Curse you, Say Yes To The Dress and adorable old people who have been married to their high-school sweethearts.  \n(Edit: xpost totally didn't work, it wouldn't let me post for some reason.

Many have pointed out that it relaxes the muscles in your body, but doesn't do anything to your mind. Well, at least for me, a lot of my panic attacks results when I get really tense in my muscles. When I start to become anxious, my muscles tense up, sudden pain can happen, one thing leads to another, and I will think I am dying and things get worse and worse. But now that my muscles are more relaxed, a lot of the panic attacks that I experienced in the past do not occur anymore. So if you are trying to completely get rid of panic attacks, it probably won't deliver. But it is an effective way of helping you I think. ",

The longer I spend in any given retail establishment, the more infuriated I become.  Sometimes particular things will set me off, like having slow-movers get in my way and block an entire aisle, waiting in a slow-moving line, or a particular product that's obviously overpriced and designed to prey upon the ill-informed or uneducated, and sometimes it just seems to creep up on me for no reason.\n\nRegardless, the longer I spend in a place, or the more various places I have to visit, the more frustrated and enraged I become, until I eventually start fantasizing about ramming people with my shopping cart, tipping over shelves or displays for no reason, or firebombing the building (not that I would ever do such things, it's just that picturing them in my mind helps to keep me calm.)  Eventually, I will reach a point where I'm just thinking \"Screw this, I gotta get out of here.  I'm ready to f&amp;$*&amp;ng get home.\"\n\nSo could this be a social anxiety kind of thing, or does it sound like something else that I'm dealing with here?\n\nEDIT: Thanks for the responses, feel free to keep adding anything else you want to mention!  I should have noted in my original post that I will be seeking out a doctor or therapist in the near future, I'm not attempting to self-diagnose or self-treat.  I just want to know what kinds of things to ask about or focus on once I *do* locate a doctor.  Of course, if I see one and their opinion on what is going on with me is much different from my own opinion, I will take their advice, I just want to have a \"starting point\" for a conversation with them.\n\nEDIT 2:  It seems it may be a moot point.  I called my insurance company today to check, and I do not have any mental health care coverage whatsoever...  bummer.",

            "selftext": "For about a month now whenever I get anxious I lose my appetite and start getting really nauseous. My anxiety lately had been in regards to a girl that I liked and anxiety involving her was the first time that I was nauseous like this. I woke up one morning and started dry heaving. Just last week when I thought she was sending negative signals I threw up one of the only full meals that I had eaten in days. She in fact was sending negative signals and rejected me after I asked her out. The anxiety is gone mostly but whenever something that makes me anxious comes up I lose my appetite and feel like throwing up. \n\n\nI started Prozac two weeks ago so hopefully that starts helping soon. For now I'm sticking to small light meals.",

If I lived in a different city then they would be less inclined to bother me.   Their pressure and my feeling of obligation always makes my anxiety flare up and makes me want to retreat even further, but I can't think of an excuse to get out of going to see them.   \n\nI love my family, but it just seems like they feel like because I'm reclusive and don't go out much that I don't have my own life and things I want to do, even if it is just playing video games, reading a book, or watching a movie/tv. \n\nAlso, its not like I never see them, heck i was over there memorial day, but it seems like they want life to be how things were back when we were all living together, before I grew up and got my own fortress of solitude.   \n\nI just want to shout at them \"I LOVE YOU BUT GO THE FUCK AWAY AND STOP BOTHERING ME!!\"  ",
