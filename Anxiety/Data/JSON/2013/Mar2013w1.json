This year has been pretty rough with a ton of physical symptoms, stress, and frustration. I'm a graduating college senior that has been accepted to medical school, but over the course of the year I have felt as if I am getting less intelligent. Things that used to be easy for me have gotten much more difficult. The things I used to think about and find interesting have become dull and unexciting. My sense of humor is fading. I just no longer feel connected to myself or the outside world. Do others feel this way? I started Cymbalta a month or so ago, and a lot of my physical symptoms have faded, but my feeling of mental decline has not. Hope you all have a great day.",

I talked to the baristas, the other customers, it was amazing. I sat by myself and enjoyed my coffee and worked on some sketches for my job.

I have been through at least a large portion of what you have been through, I can absolutely guarantee it. For the past week I have been having severe health anxiety (more than usual), \"researching\" heart conditions and freaking myself into believing that I have at least one of them, thus making it \"unsafe\" for me to continue with my CBT exposure work and exercise (what if I drop dead?!)...Throughout this, I have managed to convince myself that I am perfectly fine one moment, and then the next I get that sinking feeling in my gut \"but the symptoms do line up\"...\n\nTHESE ARE SYMPTOMS OF OUR DISORDER. It is essential not to let them fool you. The chances of a young person having a heart condition are extremely slim, no matter what you hear on the TV or see in movies. \n\nWe must stop living like we are dying. I hear so many people saying \"I wish I could just get back to the person I used to be\" - Well guess what? The person you \"used to be\" didn't waste 5 hours a day worrying themselves sick that they had an incurable illness, or that nervousness or fear (I am not using the terms panic here because I want you to SEE that the emotions you are experiencing during \"anxiety\" and \"panic\" are the same as those that EVERYONE experiences - just a slightly more unpleasant version of them) would kill them or ruin their lives. They just lived. And that worked damn well for you until your illness, didn't it? \n\nYou will never \"go back to how you were\" because NO ONE ever goes back. We all go forward. What you have to do is that the lesson that you learned when you were younger, more carefree, and use it in your daily living. Want to go exercise but scared your heart will stop? Do it anyway. And by \"do it anyway\" I don't mean sit there worrying about it and then FORCING yourself to do it. Float. Float into it, put your shoes on, put your iPod on, look around you, and just start by walking around your house. Get a feel for it. Then try jogging in place for a minute. It won't kill you, I promise. Then try it for a few more minutes. Then go outside. Run in place there. Baby steps, but MAKE A RESOLUTION to yourself right now that you will no longer live as though you are dying. Yes, you are afraid, but that doesn't mean you can't still live. You are allowed to be happy. To be carefree. To sing in the shower. To dance in your underwear. Be amongst your suffering, but do not let it become who you are. \n\nI want to write so much more, but I will save it for another post. \n\nPlease feel free to message me if you think I could help you with anything, or vice versa. Things will be ok. Remember that every day is different, and  you are the captain of your soul. ",

            "selftext": "I am 20 years old. I am afraid of other people. I am terrified of what others think of me. It isn\u2019t vanity, or pretentiousness, or ego. It\u2019s an irrational paranoia that i am constantly being watched, evaluated, judged. And no matter how much i try to convince myself, i have this terror that everyone thinks the worst of me. I know it is irrational, but it will not stop. \n\nWhen it gets really bad, i start to worry that everyone i know thinks i am mentally challenged. I start taking tiny meaningless events in my life as affirmations of this paranoia. A tiny fluctuation in tone of voice becomes hateful venom to me. A simple unanswered text causes me to fear for the worst. That they hate me. That everybody is just putting up with me. That i am a burden. \n\nMy own voice sounds alien to me. My interpersonal sensitivity is so high that a simple sentence can change the entire mood of a conversation as i perceive it, or i read into feelings that aren\u2019t there. I say something and it echoes over and over in my head until it doesn\u2019t sound like my voice at all. It sounds like gibberish. And then i start to fear that other people heard it that way too. I start to fear that i cannot control the tone of my own voice.\n\nBut the tone of my voice is nothing compared to the fear of my own words. I am so afraid of saying something that will be taken in a negative way, that i go entire conversations saying only what is wrenched out of me, when i am put on the spot and expected to say something. I am afraid of saying something stupid, or saying something offensive, or something that paints me in a negative light, or something that changes others\u2019 perception of me. I avoid social situations and conversations where there is perceived risk.\n\nThis fear has ruined relationships. I have been in love and had it ruined by both my own anxieties and the anxieties of the girl i loved. I cannot keep friendships. My friendships start to become more intimate, and i withdraw because i am afraid, or i get the feeling that the friendship is out of pity, or that the person feels obligated to spend time with me. \n\nWhat i want more than anything is a solid group of 2-3 friends that are always there for me. That i can be there for always. I want people to be constant in my life. I don\u2019t think i have had a close friend for more than 6 months. Right now i am afraid that my best friend doesn\u2019t even want to be my friend anymore. That he doesn\u2019t even like me.\n\nI am self-destructive. I lay in bed all day instead of going to class and only leave my room to go outside and smoke cigarettes. I go days without showering, weeks without clean clothes or cooking my own meals. I binge eat or skip meals. I binge drink. I drink myself right to the point where i am drunk enough to be completely impaired, but not to pass out or experience memory loss. I drink to feel comfortable. I drink as an escape.\n\nI sit in my room wishing someone wanted to do something with me. Wishing i had a lover, a friend, parents who empathized with me, anything. But i watch the clock get closer to midnight as i check email, facebook, blogs, anything to distract me from the crippling loneliness and fear, and nothing ever does. I can lose myself in books, but only for a while.\n\nI go to bed, and hope to be able to drag myself up in the morning to go to school, where i can put on a fake smile, pretend that everything is okay, make stupid meaningless jokes, while inside i am crumbling beneath the weight of my own paranoia and fear.\n",

I do this a lot at school. I certainly have some difficulty with math, and most of my anxiety happens in that class, but I just started mumbling to myself and walking/talking myself through the questions. It really helped because I'm actually verbally hearing myself, rather than having it in my head. It helps a lot mainly because my class mates are quite noisy, and hearing them talk about their personal lives covered up the thought process in my head.  \nNow, I talk to myself whenever I do my work- at school and at home. It truly has helped me calm down, and I haven't had any panic attacks for the past month.  \nI'm sorry if this is sort of spam. I suppose I'm a newbie both to Anxiety and this subreddit!

            "selftext": "I don't think I will ever, ever beat this. I have been working on it since high school... now I am two years out of college and just want to die. I've tried medicine, therapy, nutrition, chiropractic care, journaling.... I don't know what else to do. \n\nI am constantly anxious. So much that I am always on edge, waiting for something bad to happen. When I feel relaxed and nonanxious, I notice. It rarely happens. I started drinking and found it gives me that feeling. I am now drinking every night, going to work hungover two or three times a week. I hate myself so much. I am scared all of the time. I am isolated because of it. Men scare me so much. I want so badly to be in a nice, healthy relationship... but I get so scared. I hardly go out in public anymore. I go from work to home. I am hypervigilant constantly. Always aware of my surroundings, wondering why is this person acting like that..thinking what if they tried something. I can't take it anymore. \n\nFor the first time in my life outside of an actual panic attack from fear, I don't believe this is going to get better. I have completely ruined my life and am getting too old to backtrack and fix anything. I haven't had some terrible event happen in my life, like a soldier, to have PTSD. When I was little, my parents would fight constantly. My father would throw and break things and get in my mom's face and scream and push her, my mom would make me stand in front of her so he wouldn't do anything. I don't know if that is what causes this, but it is no where near what other people with anxiety/fear/PTSD have been through. I am ashamed at myself for not being stronger.\n\n**Edit:**\n\nLength of time trying things:\n\nMedication - Few months of Zoloft in high school, few months of Prozac in college.\n\nJournaling - Months at a time on and off\n\nTherapy - Longest was 3 years in college. I miss that counselor. They were great :( Probably the only guy I will ever trust. Although I hope in getting better I can trust more someday.\n\nChiro - 3 years now and sticking with it. My back is super straight at least :/\n\nNutriton - I am eating really healthy and have been for 2+ years. But I drink coffee daily, which I know does not help my anxiety.\n\n\n\nOther things I have tried:\n\nKava Kava\n\nRescue Remedy\n\nPassion flower\n\nVitamins...\n\n**Thank you so much for your responses you guys** :) It really feels good to know I am not alone in this. No one I talk in person seems to understand. I know my mom tries... but we usually end up fighting about it because I should be strong and pull myself out of it on my own (so she says, and I am trying).",

Clearly the person in question does enjoy my company, but my mind immediately goes to \"You aren't good enough. You annoy them.\" and I begin to become anxious about the possibility that everyone I enjoy being with hates me, when in fact it is just that the person doesn't express their liking for me as explicitly as I'd hope. This has been one of the more major issues for me because it has even extended to me feeling like a bother when visiting my family. When speaking to friends or family members, I feel the need to constantly express my gratitude or love in fear that they'd think I'm an ungrateful person &amp; when they don't respond as lovingly or explicitly as I'd like, I get very upset.

I checked my bpm and everything was normal except I could feel my heart my heart beating...and it was annoying and of course, it worried me.  Good ol' anxiety at it's best.  \n\nAnyhow, this feeling hasn't really let up.  I don't feel it throughout most of the day.
