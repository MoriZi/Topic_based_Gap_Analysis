I went to a halloween party :) I don't have social anxiety, but I have severe emetophobia which has been stopping me from doing pretty much ANYTHING the past few months. I've had issues just leaving my house lately, so I didn't think I would be in any shape to go to a party.\n\nBuuuut two of my friends moved downtown and threw a party last night.  I really wanted to see their apartment and just be a NORMAL 21 year old for once. So, I did it afraid. I didn't stay too long, about 2 1/2 hours. I was the first to leave - but at least I went, and I had fun. I met some new pretty awesome people, and got to catch up with old friends. I'm feeling pretty proud of myself right now and wanted to share with you guys! :)\n\nEdit: Woah! Thank you everyone! I love this community :)",

For almost the past year, if I wanted to leave the house, I had to push through horrible panic attacks that would last the entire morning before leaving the house. I tried a different medicine, and after taking it for around a month, it's really kicked in and today I actually went to the store and bought myself something and had no anxiety! For awhile, I was scared that I was gonna be stuck in the house for the rest of my life, but now I'm finding my way. I hope this brings some encouragement to others here who are in a low spot at the moment. Stay strong.\n\nEdit: Thanks for all the kind messages :) Since so many asked, I am now taking 10 mg of Lexapro. It did take 3-4 weeks for the medicine to really kick in though, but it was worth it. Before the Lexapro I was taking Remeron, but I had to switch of it because it wasn't strong enough and gave me bad side effects.",

I've been checking my behaviour obsessively, its hypochondria making me worry about my mental health.\n\nI've experienced this before in a stressful time in my life, when I was about 10 I was wrongly thought to have aspergers and got tested, and I remember it came back to haunt me later because a couple of years ago I spent months analysing my behaviour for signs of it which made my anxiety worse then that just went in a cycle.\n\nJust now I'm worried about going crazy due to the bad trip, even though there's no basis at all for thinking that. From past experience I know this is due to anxiety.  I know it will take a month or two but I just want to feel normal again.",

It'd be fine.  I could go on my vacation.  Nothing bad would happen.\n\nAnd then I got the call.\n\nI almost feel guilty about my normal anxiety right now.  Like I should be so overwhelmed with grief and I shouldn't be worried about trying to remember people's names and how everyone's going to want to hug me and how exhausted this whole thing is going to make me.  How terrible is that?  My anxiety makes me feel... selfish.\n\nAnd I wish I wasn't so anxious, because if I wasn't, then maybe I could get up in front of a group of people and tell the stories that only my mother and I know.  But I can't do that.  I can't even tell stories in small groups.  I don't have siblings to do it either, so I feel like it's all on me... and it's not something I can do.  \n\nI worry that people will think I didn't love him.  I did.  I was so lucky to have him as a father.  He wasn't perfect.  He was impatient and enjoyed annoying me and always insisted he was right and constantly interrupted me.  But he always supported my interests and goals.  He reassured me when I, an adult, had nightmares.  He'd call me over to see something interesting - whether it was on TV, outside our house, or in a book - and he'd come running if I had something to show him.  He made me laugh constantly, and I always considered it the highest praise when I made *him* laugh.  And I recently found out that he was always talking about how proud he was of me (even though I don't feel like I deserve it).\n\nWhile I was planning my trip, he said, \"I'm going to miss you while you're gone.\"  I laughed, told him that he'd probably enjoy having the house to himself so much that I'd come home and find my stuff all packed up.  We joked about it, but he insisted that he'd really miss me.  I feel so lucky that I had a dad who told me - not constantly, but often enough - that he loved me, that he really did want me around (even though I'm at an age when I'm supposed to be out of the house).\n\nI don't even know if this is the right place to put this.  I'm not looking for sympathy.  I'm not looking for advice.  I don't know.  I guess I just wanted to talk about him *somewhere*, even though this really did start as a thing about my anxiety...\n\n",

Feel free to add anything you feel helps YOU as well as any scientific stuff you have. \n\n**Disclaimer** \n\nAnxiety comes in all shapes, sizes. This post is not to tell you why, diagnose or provide an alternative to therapy or medicines. This cannot answer the \"Why am I this way\" that plagues so many. This post is to make a collection of a multitude of methods that work for the individuals who post with their Anxiety in hopes of providing a hand to those who may need it. \n\n**Acceptance and Commitment Therapy**\n\nFrom my knowledge this fairly new to field of Western Psychology.  Its main focus is Mindfulness.  Becoming aware of yourself,  feelings and thoughts.\n\n&gt;*Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) focuses in particular on the ways clients understand and perpetuate their difficulties through language. Providing a comprehensive overview of the approach and detailed guidelines for practice, this book shows how interventions based on metaphor, paradox, and experiential exercises can enable clients to break free of language traps, overcome behavioral problems, and enhance general life satisfaction*\n[Source](http://psycnet.apa.org/psycinfo/1999-04037-000)\n\n&gt;*The core conception of ACT is that psychological suffering is usually caused by experiential avoidance, cognitive entanglement, and resulting psychological rigidity that leads to a failure to take needed behavioral steps in accord with core values. As a simple way to summarize the model, ACT views the core of many problems to be due to the concepts represented in the acronym*, **FEAR**:\n\n**F**usion with your thoughts\n\n**E**valuation of experience\n\n**A**voidance of your experience\n\n**R**eason-giving for your behavior\n\nAnd the healthy alternative is to **ACT**:\n\n**A**ccept your reactions and be present\n\n**C**hoose a valued direction\n\n**T**ake action\n[Wiki](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acceptance_and_commitment_therapy)\n\n**Mindfulness and ACT**\n\n&gt;Being present means being in direct contact with the present moment, rather than drifting off into automatic pilot, and getting in touch with the observing self, the part that is aware of, but separate from, the thinking self. Mindfulness techniques are taught to experience the observing self firsthand, whether they bring awareness to each of the five senses, thoughts, or emotions. \n \nOpening up is the ability to detach from thoughts (defusion) and accepting, or making space for and dropping the struggle with painful feelings, urges, sensations, etc. Acceptance is the ability to allow what is to be as it is instead of fighting or avoiding it. If someone is thinking, \u201cI\u2019m a terrible person,\u201d they might be instructed to say, \u201cI am having the thought that I\u2019m a terrible person.\u201d This effectively separates the person from the cognition, thereby stripping it of its negative charge. When someone is experiencing painful emotions, like anxiety for example, they might be instructed to open up, breath into, or make space for the physical experience of anxiety and allow it to remain there, just as it is, without exacerbating or minimizing it.\n[Source](http://www.goodtherapy.org/acceptance_commitment_therapy.html#Mindfulness and ACT)\n\nThis is the book I'm using right now:\n\n[ACT Made Simple by Russ Harris](http://www.amazon.com/ACT-Made-Simple-Easy-To-Read-Acceptance/dp/1572247053/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1382941250&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=ACT+made+simple)\n\n**OK** Stop for a min\n\nTake a deep breath. In through your nose. Notice how your breath passes through your nose....how it cools the back of your throat as it fills up your lungs....Don't think anything of it, if you are, that's ok. Just gently bring your attention back to your breath. How your body expands from the inside out...Now, notice how your clothes feel against your skin...how your shirt feels on your shoulder...take another slow...deep breath and close your eyes and breath a couple more before coming back to this...\n\n**I know you just read those words. Now go back and take a couple mins to really try it. :)**\n\n\nThat's mindfulness. It takes practice, but It really has helped me get enough breaks in the storm to start moving forward against the wind.\n\n I know that was a lot of info. Scan it as you can, maybe come back a couple times. \n\n**Meditation**\n\nThis is the single best thing I do for myself. (Again, ill update later). Simple start. Mindfulness is kind of like Training wheels for Meditation for me. It sometimes seems like my mind doesn't want to meditate because it's terrified of being still, but once I just **Start** the resistance fades and it's wonderful, then it comes back, then it's wonderful. \n\n [Good Article on Swiss Study](http://sciencenordic.com/mindfulness-helps-against-anxiety-and-depression) \n\nI've noticed a slot of the science I find behind Meditation has been labeled *Mindfulness*. Not sure why, but there are a lot of similarities. Think of Meditation as a Good nights sleep. You dream, your body re cooperates and your mind rests to get you ready for the next day. As you go through your day, if you start to feel tired you might need a power nap to bring yourself back up. That could be Mindfulness. Meditation practice prepares you for the day, and throughout it if Anxiety starts to tap you on the shoulder, you use a mindfulness exercise to quit your mind again and get back to what you were doing. \n\n[THIS is a GREAT post from another user about getting started and it's benefits for them](http://www.reddit.com/r/getdisciplined/comments/1msb30/how_i_learned_to_harness_meditation_as_a_tool_to/)\n\nIt's referenced in the post think, but [THIS VIDEO](http://youtu.be/7irn1Ga-Gyc) has been EXTREMELY helpful in getting me started. I start is when I lay down to go to sleep and just follow the speaker until I fall asleep. It's going to sound *cheesy*, become aware that's resistance from your brain and just keep going. :)\n\n**Subreddits** \n\n/r/meditation  \n\n/r/ZenHabits \n\n\n**Exercise**\n\nGo walk for 20min. Make a playlist,  get a podcast and just go. Your anxiety will be there whether you are walking or doing nothing. The biology behind it is great. \n\n\n**Goals**\n\nSetting goals and accomplishing them is a great thing. It doesn't have to be anything BIG at all. This is for you and no one else. Pick any 1 thing you feel your anxiety has prevented from doing that you *want* to. Start small, and do something, Maybe it's visiting a new subreddit, trying one of things above, or even just responding this this post! You can do it! And even if you don't, Thats ok too. \n\n**Cut yourself some slack**\n\nI'm harder on myself than I've realized. I beat myself for the littlest things. I'm not good enough, I'm stupid, I'm lazy..why would anyone want to talk to me etc etc. Sound familiar to anyone? What would you say if a close friend that you love said that to you? What would you tell them? And say that to yourself, be your own best friend. You deserve it. \n\n**Updated 10/28: added a bunch. Let me know if there's anything else or edits to make**",

            "selftext": "I'm not sure if there's much precedent for this particular approach, but here is something I find helpful. I call it my WTG-email method.\n\nAt the start of the day I compose an email draft to myself, subject line \"WTG - [date]\". WTG stands, quite goofily, for \"way to go!\" (but I'm still too self conscious to be able to actually write that out, but it is how I read it!).\n\nNow, in this email draft, which I update throughout the day, I write at the top \"You've already done these good things\". Then, I list everything even remotely \"good\", \"positive\", \"healthy\" that I do, right after doing it. On some days I might get the great pleasure of writing down a hard thing \"had important meeting and got through it\", but on plenty of days the main items are things like \"pet the cat\", \"ate breakfast\", \"bought groceries\", \"folded one towel, kind of\", \"talked to xyz on gchat\", \"paid a bill\", oh, and of course the old favorite \"made my WTG list\". \n\nBy the end of even a pretty inactive day, it's a pretty long list. One might think that seeing all these tiny things might be depressing, but weirdly, it's not. When it's noon and I start to berate myself that I've done nothing, I can look and it's clear that I've done *something* (even if it's just getting out of bed, or making the list). \n\nThe best part, I think, is at the end of the day I read back through the whole thing, and remind myself of all the big and small ways I took care of myself. \n\nAfter reading through, I hit send and in the morning it's sitting there in my inbox from yesterday. When I get up, I open it and can see that yesterday wasn't so bad, and the reality check also helps me to have reasonable hopes and goals for the day. \n\nFinally, I archive yesterday's and start anew \nSubject: WTG - [date]\nBody: You've already done these good things...\n1) Making this list, even though you think it's sort of goofy\n2) ?\n\nThanks for letting me share, everyone.",

I had a panic attack during it because I didn't like that I couldn't stop myself tripping. \n\nThen after, unknowingly anxiety was giving me really disturbing  thoughts, I kept thinking that shrooms had changed me forever and I would never be 'right' again, until I realised I felt this before, it was the anxiety causing and perpetuating those thoughts. After that I calmed down and went back to normal.\n\nRight now I'm sort of riding out the after effects of a panic attack i had coming home Friday night, which was actually a mild relief because it confirmed it was anxiety doing this, not the shrooms! I've found after a panic attack there's not really anything you can do about the anxious feelings, just sit them out and they'll be gone in a few days. I just wanted to post this as a warning, obviously its not my place to tell you what you can or cant do.\n\nTl;Dr, if you have anxiety magic mushrooms may not be a good idea",

It came quite suddenly. I just suddenly noticed I was choking and couldn't breathe.\n\nI started crying, trying to calm down and breathe again. It happened on and off throughout the movie.

I've gotten quite adept at hiding anxiety, so I sat still and tried calming myself down with slow breaths and telling myself it'll pass, and luckily, my jacket had a hood, so I had that masking my crying face. \n\nI also managed to get myself to calm down enough to stop crying before the movie ended and regain composure.\n\nI felt terrible for the whole day after that.
