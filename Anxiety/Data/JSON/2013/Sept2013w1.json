It's taken many forms, from agoraphobia to general interactions, but for the past year or so, it's turned to sex. I've had sex before, and I enjoy it. I've only had it really with one person in high school, and once last year with another girl in my first year of college.\n\nI'm just so anxious that I won't be able to provide. That I other can't get it up because of my anxiety (has happened a few times) or that I finish too quickly (has also happened a few times). I like the thought of sex on my own, like fantasizing about it. But whenever the thought becomes real, or I'm put in a situation where it's possible, I get so stressed out.\n\nI've met this insanely beautiful girl, and apart from this problem and that I'm not an insanely built guy, I'm decently attractive physically and personality wise. But I know that a girl like her would want sex before establishing a relationship and wouldn't deal with problems like this. I don't blame her, at all, obviously, but I'm afraid this will happen forever... What do I do?",

My anxiety is starting to get under control and I'm on the road to recovery, and I'm probably not quite there yet.  I'm antsy to make money, but I know that I need to do some volunteer work or something to get me ready before I make a commitment.  \n\nI haven't worked steadily in 4 years.  Recently I lost my car insurance because I couldn't pay for it anymore, so now I only have access to public transportation, which can limit your ability to get a job.  I am great at interviewing, but how do I explain the lack of work on a resume, even if I stretch what I have.  It's not 4 years worth. Has anyone succeeded in getting back into the work environment after a long bout of anxiety?    I'm going to a local community mental health place that has job resources and assistance.  After so many years of being such an overachiever this is quite humbling.  ::sigh::",

            "selftext": "I suffer from anxiety, social anxiety, and depression, along with self-esteem issues. I've never dated, been in love or even been kissed. Although in the past guys have apparently shown an interest in me but I'm terrible at receiving and giving signs of attraction so I often overlooked flirting guys, assuming they were just being nice because 'most guys wouldn't find me 'attractive' or would like me if they 'really' got to know me anyway.' (People have complimented my looks before, it just boils down to low self-esteem I guess).\n\nAnyway I'm here today because I need some advice about sex and relationships. This is super embarrassing to admit but my problem is that I'm *extremely* sex-obsessed. I'm horny nearly all the time and just want to lose my virginity and start FINALLY having sex. I'm an intelligent person, I run a small business, yet I fear that due to some insatiable, primal need I'll end up going to bed with the first guy I get the chance to do it with. ...And part of me wants this. \n\nI don't have many friends, especially since I moved cities last year. I don't have any male friends and now that I'm no longer in university, I don't get to meet guys often (not sure how to talk to them anyway). And I also don't get crushes often but I've noticed that whenever I do these days (about once per year or less), my mind goes straight past friendship and love, and I start fantasizing about how our sex life would be. (My most common fantasy is of the guy eating me out, something I've lusted to experience for awhile now). I hate that my mind goes straight to the gutter, when a few years ago I couldn't even fathom thinking about a crush sexually without feeling sick.\n\nThere's a handyman, a friend of the family, he's 29, tall, good-looking and really nice. He also has an 8 year old kid. Anyway he's been showing me signs of interest for a while now (even asked me out to drinks once) and although the better part of me doesn't want to mix business and relationships (and doesn't want to mess with a guy 5 years older with a *child*) the horny, irrational me just pictures us having sex and him going down on me. \n\nI'm afraid that if he comes on to me more I'll give in and try to have sex with him as soon as I get a chance. I'm partly ashamed by this because I've always believed in waiting to have sex, waiting till you're certain the guy loves you and vice versa. But these days I just want to fuck. I'm 24, never even been kissed, and in a way I feel like I have zero standards. I don't want to disrespect myself or ruin any potential relationships by obsessing over sex and rushing into it. I'm just so horny these days that I've kind of stopped caring. ... Yeah, I'm a walking contradiction.\n\nHas anyone else been through something similar? Can I get some advice? I haven't been given a good reason why not yet, so I really think I'll sleep with this guy if I get the chance. I may never get a chance to be that intimate with anyone again. And I just wanna feel what it's like, burn off some pent up frustration. \n",

            "selftext": "It's amazing how many anxiety sufferers don't understand anxiety and how to properly clear it so here is a quick analogy I use.  My background is in computer science, I spent 10 years programming computers and have since left that field in favor or reprogramming subconscious minds.\n\nThe key thing is knowing how the subconscious/unconscious mind works. What is important to know is that, just like a computer, the mind is constantly collecting and storing information based on our experiences (creating our memory).  Based on the information being stored in our memory the subconscious is then creating programs that are always running (lets call them system processes of the mind). These programs are what define our habits, beliefs and behaviors. Some of the ways new programs get created is through repetition (for example if someone keeps putting you down it can turn into a program that reinforces low self esteem) or via traumatic events.\n\nIn the case of anxiety, the subconscious mind is also running programs designed to keep us safe. For example, lets say you've got a headache and take a couple of Tylenol capsules. Through the process you end up significantly choking on one of the pills as it gets lodged in your throat. Luckily, the pill eventually dislodges but this can cause the subconscious mind to believe that pills are a risk to your safety.  It can then launch a program that will create a fear response (hence anxiety) at the thought of taking pills (thinking it is keep you safe) or even a physical response (maybe your throat muscles tense up as you're getting ready to try to take a pill).\n\nRemember that when it comes to anxiety we are dealing with the subconscious/unconscious ... so those who are unaware of the cause of their anxiety may simply be unaware of the root events that created the program. For example, you may have had an experience at the age of 2 (maybe attacked by a dog) that you no longer consciously remember although a program created at that time can be creating fear/anxiety in relation to dogs.  It may also be a program created from habits you subconsciously picked up from your parents (very common), siblings, schoolmates, etc ...\n\nAll that being said (and this may already be obvious) for those who are trying to avoid taking medications or get off medications you need to look into and clear the root cause of your anxiety (the malevolent program) in order to properly eliminate it permanently.",

I thought I was shy, or awkward or just an all around wuss.\n\nJump forward to now, I am 23 and I have never had a proper job. I'd be scared by people relying on me. I would subconsciously self sabotage any job searches by underplaying my good qualities. I didn't want to be the one that made claims on my resume only to end up as a disappointment.\n\nAfter university things got serious, I had no school to claim to be focusing on, this was the real world. My anxiety made me hide away, to flee, to give up. I was so scared of everything. Eventually this manifested into depression. Why was I so useless? Why was I so scared? What is wrong with me?\n\nEventually I hit rock bottom, everyone was so disappointed in me. The thing I was so scared of happening. I started biting the bullet and putting my best foot forward, every time it felt like I was being stabbed in the gut.\n\nToday I got offered a job, nothing flashy, but it's a start. Everyone around me is ecstatic, but I feel like I'm going to vomit constantly. What if I screw up? What if they regret hiring me? What if I fail? Every time I break a brick, I realize there is still a whole wall that is keeping me from my real peace of mind. I just want to be able to relax.\n\nEven though this doesn't feel like it, this should be a victory. I'm hoping it will feel like it soon. Once I start my job I hope to become comfortable. I want to be GREAT at it, I want to succeed. Until then I will fight these dreaded butterflies every second, every minute, every hour, every day.",

I work on the weekends, but I'm looking for another job to fill my time during the week. I am 19, female, and I am out of school for another few months. Today I am at the computer looking up a list of places to call and inquire as to if they have any positions available. But the second I pick up the phone, I freak out. \n\nI haven't even dialed the number yet. I can't. My heart starts beating faster and my hands get clammy and I can practically feel my throat closing up. I used to think that \"choking\" was a figure of speech for  when somebody is nervous about something, but it's a literal way to describe what is happening. And if I ever get as far as actually making a phone call and speaking with somebody? Forget it. It is difficult to talk to them because I feel like i'm not breathing enough, and I choke. \n\nFor people who haven't choked before, I don't know how to describe it to you. My throat feels strange, like it's tightening. I have to stop talking in the middle of my sentences to try and swallow. Repeatedly.  I am out of breath while talking and I know it's perfectly noticeable for the person on the other end of the phone. I'd really like to find another job but I can't even make a damn phone call to ask somebody if they have any positions available. I don't even know what i'm afraid of.\n\nDoes anybody have similar experiences, i.e. fear of just speaking to somebody on the telephone? :( How do you handle it?",

            "selftext": "Hi everyone, I just wanted to share the experience I am starting today - switching from Paxil to Zoloft. I hope input from r/anxiety may help, and that I can contribute back useful information for those who need/want to make a switch, too.\n\nSo, I've taken Paxil for years, and I've always struggled with weight and appetite issues with it. It's unfortunate because Paxil helps my anxiety quite a bit, but I've also gained about 60 pounds with it, and have an uncontrollable appetite. My diet never really changed over the years. If I had to choose, I'd take the weight (my anxiety was crippling), but I'd always wanted to have it both ways. \n\nWith psychiatrist supervision, I've tried cutting back Paxil dosage, as well as switching to Zoloft before. This will be my second attempt at the Zoloft switch.  Currently, (well, through yesterday!), I took 30mg of Paxil once a day. \n\nDuring the cut-back attempt, the plan was to cut my dosage to 25mg, then to 20mg, and possibly 15mg if it still kept the anxiety in check. After about a week of 25mg, I was going through serious withdrawal from Paxil. I experiencing severe \"brain zaps\", and also started getting horrible nausea. Increasing the dosage back fixed the problems in about 24-48 hours (of which I slept through the majority off). It was probably the worst I'd felt in my life, in terms of overall crappiness.\n\nA little over a year ago, we made the attempt to switch from Paxil to Zoloft. The idea was to go from 30mg Paxil to 20, then 10, then 0. I have forgotten the exact dosages, but at the same time, Zoloft was to go 1/3 dose (w/20mg of the Paxil), 2/3 dose (with 10mg Paxil), and then full. After a few days of the 20mg Paxil with 1/3 dose of Zoloft, I started having the brain zaps again, and facing depression problems. It sucked, although not as bad as the attempt to lower the Paxil dose. I resumed full Paxil dose, and felt much better quickly.\n\nSo why try the direct switch? Well, a few studies and articles seem to say that the direct switch works better (as well as some anecdotes I found on other anxiety forums). Unfortunately, the one really in depth article I had bookmarked is a 404 now, but if you can find a cache of it, here is the link: http://www.gpnotebook.co.uk/simplepage.cfm?ID=x20030828225122296270 My doctor said he thought there was no harm in trying it, and my wife is well aware of the change and will be on the look out for anything weird or dangerous (like depression) along with myself. My hope is I will be able to manage my anxiety and weight on Zoloft. Even if Zoloft doesn't allow me to control my weight better, it would be a success to me to know I overcame the problems of going off Paxil.\n\nWish me luck! :-) Any advice is greatly appreciated!",

Honestly I don't know a lot about those disorders, and don't really want to. I know enough about them that I worry endlessly about developing symptoms of them.\n\n  I am seeing a therapists and bother her and my regular doctor have assured me that I show no signs of either, but of course that only keeps me cool for a while then it returns again.\n\n  Whats even more awesome, I've developed a bunch of eye floaters recently (causes in part from an eye injury that happened recently I believe) and that hasn't helped, seeing little white and black spots all over my vision lol\n\n  Do any of you wrestle with this phobia? Do you have any tips or coping techniques?  I sincerely hope that every single one of you finds peace and comfort and is able to conquer you anxiety.  Good luck to you!",
