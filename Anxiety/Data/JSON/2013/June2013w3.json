            "selftext": "*Itches, soreness, tingling, numbness, pains, and cramps happen.\nThey happen to everybody, often.\nThey can happen for random little reasons, or they can happen because of specific actions.\nEither way, they are almost never symptoms of major diseases or afflictions.\n\n*A skipped heart beat every few seconds is something to worry about. One is not.\nA little chest discomfort is probably a stretched muscle or heartburn.\nIf you lean on your arm, it will become numb. It's not a heart attach.\nYour face, when focused upon, will feel tingly and twitchy - it happens.\nHeadaches happen, they aren't prophets of strokes or brain cancer.\nHeart attackes show wildly varying but almost always strong symptoms.\nFocusing on one side of your body will make it feel different, feeding into paranoia.\n\n*Our bodies have been through a lot, we have crossed nerves and damaged tissues that tingle or twitch or cramp or get numb sometimes. Strange or odd sensations will happen to everybody older than 2.\n\n*You're getting older, but you're not getting unhealthy. Health is relative.\n\n*Go for a walk or go swimming or something. Clear your head.\nYou're fine, you're fine, you're fine isn't a mantra, it's the truth. Believe yourself.\n\n*When you worry about your body, your scope of attention will focus down to the tiniest nerve bundles. We're constantly recieving a stream of sensation from every nerve, but we drown them out. When you start focusing on a part of your body, your attention zooms in and you start to feel things you don't remember feeling five minutes ago, making you think it's getting worse. Remember that.\n\n*You're not being a wimp, you're not crazy. Just affected by modern health-watching.\nOur bodies are strong enough to resist viruses, bacteria, temperatures, starvation, dehydration, poisoning, overmineralization, falls, cuts, bruises, traumatic events, and more. We're stronger than you think. \n\n*How many times a year do you think people just drop dead because of sudden and oncoming afflictions? A huge amount. Millions. It's the truth - it happens. You know how many people there are? Just by sheer odds, not to mention that your lifestyle is significantly more healthy than most other human beings on this planet, your chance of getting a stroke or cancer or a heart attack in the next couple years is probably incredibly low. Don't believe me? Start living a healthier lifestyle. Your odds go way down the better you live anyways, so you have no reason to worry. Just live.\n\n*The anxiety is not rational fear. We are rational beings and have to act like it.\nI know it's hard to pretend you aren't feeling afraid for your life at the hint of something wrong, but it doesn't hurt to pretend, even just to yourself. Maybe you doubt it will work, but eventually a little positive reinforcement like \"for God's sake, I'm fine\" to yourself here and there might do some good.\n\n*But what the hell do I know, I'm having a stroke at this very moment because my eye is twitching.",

I freak out and have trouble sleeping because of them. I consider them to be one of my biggest triggers for an attack.\n\nI  try my hardest to find a medium with it- I'm okay with certain films that are more towards the 'thriller' genre, but often that is not enough.\n\nTonight, we were supposed to go over to his brother's house, and they know about my issue with horror films. They called ahead and said they were renting one. I said it was fine, go ahead without me, I'll stay home. Instead he got cranky and stayed home until now when I was just like, \"just go\". I'm fine with missing out because I don't want to put myself into that situation. I've come a long way and I've learned to say no about these things. I worry way too much and I have an over active imagination, so I'm perfectly fine being home by myself for a few hours. on the upside, I can have the whole bed to myself and watch whatever I want on TV in the bedroom.\n\nI went a head and read the summary of the film and it was obvious that it wasn't for me. I've since gone and taken a Lorazapam and I feel a little bit better.\n\nHowever, I was just wondering if this happens with anyone else on this Sub? If so, how to do you cope?\n\nThank you! :) ",

Everything went fine, I walked them to the theatre where I left them. I was going to go to a very big mall to buy a special kind of automatic pencils I very much like to write with. It was a treat because recently I started some work as a tutor and was able to save up some money.\n\nI was hungry though, so before I went shopping I stepped in for a hamburger to a small restaurant. I ordered a great one, with hot sauce I like and... then the throuble started. Three big red hot-sauce stains appeared suddenly on my cream-white shorts. I tried to wipe them off with napkins but they had already gone into the fabric. There was nothing I could do.\n\nI thought this was the end of my trip. It was so embarrassing. I wanted to go straight to my home to change the shorts and then go to the mall. I live pretty far away, though, and it would mean a long trip both ways.\n\nBut then I thought that these things happen to everybody. That I should go to the mall anyway. That maybe it wouldn't be so bad. That I would understand if I saw someone with stained shorts.\n\nAnd I did, and it was totally awesome, because nobody stared at me or my shorts stained with red hot sauce. I bought two pencils and some lead and then went home. And when I changed, I noticed that the stains were not that big after all and not very noticeable.\n\nHooray for me!\n",

            "selftext": "I finally got the balls up enough to post in this sub reddit for help. Please forgive my use of a throwaway and my poor writing skills.  \n\nMy name is John I'm 23 years old and I'm a firefighter and a paramedic. I've suffered from anxiety since highschool. I have no idea what set me off, it literally happened overnight. I started getting what i later found out were panic attacks all throughout the day and they manifest in my stomach, and make my arms and legs feel like jello. Fast forward to now. I've come a long way since not being able to go out to eat or go the movies but I've never been able to shake away panic and anxiety that comes with having to be somewhere at a set time with no escape. Kind of a like a job, or something that you can't back out of without their being severe reprocussions. All during medic school I would get a lot of anxiety before class, knowing if i missed the days they would throw me out. So I guess what I'm saying is. How can I bring my anxiety level down the night before? How do I keep my mind from racing all night and my stomach goes into knots? How do I carry out my job? And how do I get over it? Any help would be so much appreciated. ",

            "selftext": "19yo Female here,\n\nI would have posted this in one of the rape counselling forums but my \"abuser\" never got that far, so I didn't feel it appropriate.\n\nA quick breakdown, I was 9 when my uncle approached me for sex he was 24 at the time and we lived in the same house for 4 years after this, I told him no but the mere thought that he wanted something so vile from his only niece is a huge part of why my anxiety manifested.\nI kept this hidden from my family, until I was 17, when he got arrested for having 10,000 images of child pornography on his computer, and for using a carriageway to groom a person under 16 years. \n\nWhen he was first arrested my mother thought it was some kind of mistake (the article detailing his charges wasn't released for two days after his arrest) she wanted him to come and live with us, as him and my grandmother were getting kicked out of their home over his charges.\n\nI broke down and finally told her what happened, we cried together and she ceased all contact with him immediately, my uncle voluntarily handed himself in to Police to await trial and avoid homelessness, this was back in 2011, I've run into a family friend a couple of times who told me he was up until at least Feb this year still waiting for a trial (mind you his trial was set for Jan 2012) \n\nThis is the part that scares me, He is part aboriginal, and has very slight Alcohol Fetal Syndrome, that he has always played up to, I watched him get away with burning down a building and stealing thousands of dollars worth of computer equipment, they delayed his trial for that over 3 years, only to let him off with a small amount of community service (despite having priors for arson) I am scared shitless that his ethnicity is going to get him off the hook again, and believe me, if you're Aboriginal you get a lot of leniency in the Australian courts, I've resigned myself to the fact he won't be in for long, but when he gets out is what brings me to my point, \nWe live in a town of 200,000 people, but still one of those towns where you run into people you know all the time, this is my home town and I don't want to leave but the thought of running into him gives me an absolute panic attack, how have other redditors dealt with their abuser being in the same town? I would love and appreciate any advice whatsoever.\n\n\n*edit* Thanks for the replies everyone, no a restraining order is NOT an option for me, because that would mean getting the police involved, which I have no intention of doing, I don't physically see him as a threat, I just never want to run into him again, I pretended for 8 years he hadn't done anything to me, for the families sake, I don't intend on ever going through that again.\n\nAnd yes he was abused, once, and got thousands of dollars because it was an arcade owner who abused him, he also watched his father abuse my mum for years (who was her stepfather) So it does not make me sympathize for him at all, merely hate him more because he knows first hand what it's like, how it mentally messes with you forever.",

            "selftext": "It's strange how much I remember every detail of it, but I am going to give a shorter version of it.\n\nUp until the age of 8, I had always been pretty normal. Well, that changed until I switched schools. This school had a class for 3rd graders called ''Home care''. Basically it taught kids how to stay safe at home; things like ''Don't play with knives''. Well, one day we started talking about injuries, and how you should clean wounds if you ever get a cut from playing outside. Whilst the teacher was talking, I was not listening carefully to her, and I remember her saying ''I had a friend who scraped her knee. She didn't clean it. She almost died after 2 days''. I am pretty sure I just misheard her, but I got this really scary feeling after that. I had to wash my hands after touching anything until they got really dry and were bleeding EVERYWHERE, and had to wash any wounds or cuts a lot. I would waste so much water and soap because of this, I was scared that a really small cut would end up killing me. Over time I was scared of dying in my sleep. I ended up getting scared of going blind, scared of having brain cancer when I had a headache. I got scared that my heart would suddenly stop. And I was still just 8. Mind you I was not having any panic attacks; I was just always scared. Especially at night. \n\nThis health anxiety came and went, but over the years it got worse. \n\nI ended up moving again to another school after 6th grade in another country, and that's where my social anxiety developed. Before, I didn't really have problem talking with others, even if I was shy. But now, I was already in a state where I made up irrational thoughts since I thought anything around me was a potential health threat. This caused me to become scared that people didn't like me, so I avoided them, and decided on getting good grades instead. I eventually got picked on because I was never with people. And whenever I tried to become friends with people, they mocked me. Eventually I got social anxiety, aggro phobia, and had difficulty just talking and having coherent thoughts (since I never used my tongue to talk). Mind you, I still had no panic attacks, but I was just so terrified of people.\n\nI eventually reached 11th grade and became really depressed, because I thought I was making friends, but they talked bad about me behind my back. I just felt like ''why bother trying anything ever again? You are just going to set yourself up for failure, like you always have''. My grades went from A's down into C/D :(.\n\nI graduate high school and went into college in the same country where I was in 3rd grade. I still had fear of people and fear of diseases, that when I went into college I felt like a odd apple of an apple tree. Everyone behaved so normal, whilst I was a freak because of all the fear I went through in the past. My aggro phobia got a lot worse. This is where I started to get panic attacks. The lecture hall was always pretty dark, and I often thought I was going blind. I started to be scared of that lecture room. I couldn't go to classes that were in that room. The fact that I got a panic attack from going blind made me have panic attacks from all the other things; fear of cancer, fear of my heart stopping, fear of internal bleeding, fear of going in public. Eventually it lead to self injury and eating disorders. I just became a heap of mess. \n\nI am done with two years now in college. Even if I am not happy with myself, am still anxious and have the problems I listed above, I am doing a bit better now. I guess it's all because I found my passion for math and science, and whenever I feel down I just read about those two.I have made a few ''acquaintances'', but have never made any new friends. Thank god I still have my friends from 3rd grade, or I would be all alone.\n\nI just wanted to share this because I feel how it is amazing and interesting how all of this happened because of what I heard my 3rd grade teacher said; ''I had a friend who scraped her knee. She didn't clean it. She almost died after 2 days''. Two sentences. Two sentences was all it took to break me. I guess the moral of my story is to always be careful of what you say.",

I've been hoping to find a part time job while I go to university. I've never had one before, but I've had one interview and I thought I was going to sweat to death. I usually can't even bring myself to walk in and ask for an application or call the company. It stresses me out and makes me feel like crap. If I'm suddenly the center of attention I have a hard time breathing normally, I turn red, I sweat, I stammer, and then I get light headed and run away--usually to a bathroom to cry. This affects me every day. It keeps me from having a normal life. I have one friend and a boyfriend. They are the only people, besides family, that I am comfortable around. I'm sure there are other things, but I can't think of them right now.\n\n\nAfter I thought about all of these problems I realized I have anxiety...about way too many things. I want to see a doctor of some sort to get treated. When I think about having a normal life I feel so hopeful and happy. \n\n\nI don't know how to go about finding a doctor. What kind?
