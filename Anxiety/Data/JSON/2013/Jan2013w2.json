It's been quite a while since it's been at a level where it completely debilitated me and fingers crossed that I can maintain management of it now. \n\n\nIn those times when it was unbelievably terrifyingly bad, depression hit strong as your mind starts focusing on thoughts like 'is this the rest of my life now', 'is it ever going to end', 'can I stand this for the rest of my life/do I want to live it' etc.... You begin to think and act on this assumption that it is going to last forever. \n\nHaving had it for awhile now where I've been through so many waves of better and worse, better and worse I realized that no one feeling/sensation/thought/attack/whatever is going to last forever. \n\nUsually, the saying 'nothing lasts forever' has negative connotations (i.e. life, childhood, fun etc..) but it's also true for all the bad stuff in life (i.e. pain, anxiety, depression, stress etc..). This train of thought took emphasis off the symptoms I experience on a day to day level. I knew that when I felt horrible, I knew it was going to pass eventually. Over time, what this did was allow my brain to maintain focus on other things and less on my symptoms and I began to notice they weren't as obtrusive and severe as they once was. \n\nIt's simple and you'll probably say duh, but really try and drive that into your way of thinking.

Before that I had only had a couple of jobs and ended up quitting because I felt anxious about just BEING there, then anxious about GOING there when I wasn't at work.  Every moment of my life was like a clock ticking down to when I had to go and be at work for how ever many hours.  Back then I only ever had part time jobs, too.  Now that I am back in the \"real world\" and have to get a job outside of my home, I'm feeling the same feelings.  \n\nI got a temp job and have been at it for a week and I already want to quit.  I CAN'T quit so I won't, but I want to.  Every moment I look at the clock and see seven more hours.. five more hours.. 2 more hours, one more hour, but then i have to drive for an hour and by the time i take a shower and make dinner it's right to bed to come back here for the same damn thing again tomorrow.\n\n I tried to explain my anxiety to my husband and he says, \"oh honey everyone feels that way.\"  I'm like really?  Everyone cries at work because they are panicking about being trapped there?\n\nI feel so pathetic, because billions of people work full time or more their whole lives and I can't handle a silly computer job for more than a week without flipping out.  I seriously hate this!\n\nTLDR: Working makes me feel trapped and constantly anxious.",

I believe my mother has had mental problems for a long time and although I can see everything that is \"wrong\" with her - what she does so that I dont like her - I see myself doing the same things now (she denies she has any problems). \nI have social anxiety very badly but now I have panic attacks when I feel claustrophobic or when I cannot control a situation. My parents came to see me today and I got claustrophobic because where we were is small and I felt sick. My dad was being controlling with certain things which are small but I started freaking out. They think I was being ungrateful and rude to them, but it just wasn't something I could control and I didn't want to explain how I really feel, they would have thought I was crazy. After they left I realized I really do have problems  (a close friend has told me they think I have mental problems but I never wanted to believe them before). \nAnyways, I just wanted to write this down and I hope anyone willl reply, I just really wanted someone to talk to.

            "selftext": "Hi!\n\nA while ago I wrote a post about how I finally gave in and started taking Citalopram. This my update after 8 weeks.\n\nI take 20mg (one tablet) every morning. The phase of side effects was very managable. I got pretty much all common side effects but almost all have gone. The only thing remaining is the yawning all the time, sexual problems (I pretty much have no libido anymore) and I think I may have sleeping issues due to the meds.\n\nDo the meds help? I'm not so sure. What I noticed is that it stabilized my mood. Even on days where everyone can kiss my ass and I sleep till 3pm, I get up but don't feel the usual self-hate, no feeling of \"god damnit another fucked up day\" anymore. I just don't give a shit, so even if things look grim, I'm not in a bad mood. That doesn't mean am happy-on-drugs and psyched, I just don't slip into the lows so much, which is a good thing.\n\nDoes it help with the anxiety? It should as Citalopram is anxiolytic meaning it should resolve/ease the anxiety. I'm not really sure it does. According to my therapist, this may be a sign it's not working as after 8 weeks you definitely should feel a change. As an example, it took all my willpower to go get a haircut two days ago. I only managed to get my hair cut because noone was there so I didn't have to wait and sit down, or else I would've bailed, so I guess it's not working as supposed. Going to the doc soon to see if I need to up my dosage or possibly switch medication (oh boy...).\n\nRegarding the therapist:\n\nI was incredibly lucky to find a therapist that does behavioural therapy as well as depth psychology (the classic  \"is your childhood responsible for all that\" basically). So far I have been in 4 or 5 sessions and while I think the guy may be solid, I didn't get any solid advice so far. Mostly, I talk about how I've been doing, then we talk about certain problems, but the feedback so far has been pretty much useless and for my taste way too much esoteric. I hate it. I want a solid plan on how to tackle my misguided thoughts, I don't want to \"feel the energy of the room\" or something like that, it won't help me buy bread and it won't help my manage 8 hours of work.\n\nLuckily my boss is very considerate and I've been working half-days for a few weeks. It helps a lot, but it helps by removing stressful situations. I don't think I got any better, I just don't have to power through 8 hours now. I'm pretty sure working full days would easily result in the same issues I had when I worked full days.\n\nSo to summarize: The meds probably aren't working as intended, and I'm not sure my therapist is the right guy for me. Luckily, the meds seem to stabilize my mood or I'm pretty sure I'd be in another big low.\n\nThoughts and comments much appreciated!\n\n(Sorry I didn't link my original post, I couldn't find it right away, I may have posted with a throwaway, not sure)",

            "selftext": "Hi everybody,\n\nI'm a 25 year old male graduate student. I do not suffer from anxiety myself. I'm not shy, and actually I'm quite the social butterfly. (I hope it's still ok for me to come here!)\n\nI have a very good friend, let's call him B, whose family I am close with. I frequently go to his family parties. This friend has been dating a girl, let's call her K, for the past two years. I met K's sister a few months ago (let's call her D), and I immediately found her to be the cutest thing in the entire world. She is artsy, tiny, has the cutest smile, she's successful, but she is very shy. B had told me that she suffers from fairly severe social anxiety. After a few weeks of hesitation, I asked D to go have a drink with me, and she accepted. During that date, she completely stole my heart, and I was relieved to see that, after all, her anxiety wasn't all that bad. She came across as a perfectly normal person, but then she left the date very abruptly after a couple of drinks. At first, I thought I had done something wrong, but it turns out it was my first encounter with her anxiety.\n\nI saw her again that week, and this time I made my intentions clear to her. It caused her a lot of anxiety, because, at 22, she's basically completely new to dating. We've been dating for a few weeks now, and she has gotten used to being with me, though I can tell she's still quite worried.\n\nSo why am I coming here? Well, I like this girl very much but I have mixed feelings about what's going on. The girls I've dated before have always been of the rather social type, and haven't had any problems interacting with my friends and my family. This is completely new to me. With D, I just don't see that happening for now; we're sort of living a relationship that is isolated from the rest of the world. She would freak out if I introduced her to my parents or something like that. I don't mind it for some time, as it's still very early in the relationship, but I'm eventually going to want her to take her place in my life, and I just don't see it happening unless she can get rid of most of her social anxiety.\n\nI want to help her, and I think I can to some degree. She says I'm already helping her. I would like her to develop confidence in herself, and a healthy relationship can definitely help her do that. But at the same time, I feel that it's not fair for me to hope that her anxiety will get better with time. I would like to fall in love with her, but in my mind, it's impossible until she is confident enough in herself. The burden cannot all be on my shoulders. \n\nSociety is always suspicious of people like me, who develop an attraction for someone who lacks confidence in themselves. We are immediately pointed at, and considered manipulative or even predatory. I don't believe that I am these things, and I consider myself a loving and considerate person. But the social stigma is huge. I don't really care what people think of me, but I can't completely dismiss these ideas either. What if I'm just fooling myself?\n\nRight now, my plan is to go ahead with the relationship. I really enjoy spending time with her, she is affectionate and funny and cute, and I want to help her become the person she would like to be. But the line is thin between that and \"I want to turn her into the person I'd like her to be\". I definitely think she deserves all of the love and care that I'm able to give to her, but I can't love her more than she loves herself, and it would be unfair of me to impose conditions like that.\n\nI don't have any specific questions, but I'd really, really appreciate some input from someone who is more familiar with anxiety than me.\n\nAnyways, thanks for reading and good luck to you all!",

It's interfering with my life again, and I won't see my therapist for another week yet...\n\n\n**EDIT:** Thanks for your help everybody. The advice really helped, the lunch date went great, and I'm going to see her again. Everything seemed positive for awhile after... But then wouldn't you know it, I'm now feeling the exact same way.
