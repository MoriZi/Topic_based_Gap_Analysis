What's wrong??  \"Oh I just wanted to see if you wanted to sign up for this service that I'm selling. I'm one account away from getting promoted\")  So, its not even an emergency, and they call me like someone fucking died.  \n\nSo the above example happened yesterday, and I said without thinking much about it that I would be able to help my mother out. (she was unemployed for 18 months, and started selling insurance recently)  I figure, hey if I can help her by getting a life insurance policy, why not?  But, I recently lost my license (I've ordered a new one from the DMV), and I'm NOT DRIVING ANYWHERE until I get a new one.  Also, I apparently need an ID anyway to sign up.  So flash to this morning. I'm looking for my ID again, and i get 42,000 phone calls from my parents place. Just before I throw my phone out the window, I turn the ringer off, and go to bed.  After I calmed down, about an hour later, I get another phone call and explain what's going on.  I somehow get convinced to go out anyway, and then hear \"Oh make sure you don't come in wearing jeans, you need to look presentable. see you soon!\"  AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!\n\n1.  I'm not going ANYWHERE TODAY.\n\n2.  I'm guaranteed to get no fewer than 16,777,216 phone calls as a result.\n\n3.  My parents will probably come over to my place.  Even if I don't answer the door, they might use my spare key that I left at their place in case i lock myself out.\n\n4.  It feels like the world is literally ending today.",

I started having an attack this morning after I had already parked the car, but I distracted myself with opening up my store and the symptoms subsided. I stopped being able to drive in October of last year, one day I was fine, the next I wasn't. For some reason every time I drove and had to stop at a red light or intersection I would have an attack. It took for 3 months to figure out exactly what was going on. I thought I was dying! I loved driving and enjoyed my independence! At times even being the passenger in a car would cause me to have an attack and they weren't driving crazy or anything. Always stopping at intersections or stop signs I would just freak out. It's SO irrational! Over the past few days I've been reading through others posts here and it helped me a lot. So. Thank you! Reading about how you've done little steps toward conquering your triggers and I thought I'd give mine a try. It worked. I hope I'm not jinxing myself and I don't think I'll be back to driving 100% and by myself just yet, but it's something. Baby steps!",

Well, now it just plugged itself completely, the pressure is greater, and I'm starting to freak out because I can't hear anything and I can't get it to unplug. \n\nThere is *no way* I'm going to be able to force myself to go to the university clinic. I have classes through most of their hours every day, and it would take me hours of convincing myself to get myself to go in there, if I even managed. I freak out and cry just at the thought of it.

            "selftext": "TL;DR woke up this morning, started having an anxiety attack, decided to live blog it because fuck anxiety attacks and the high horses they come on\n-\n* Trying to be calm, rational.  This will blow over.  Just a matter of time.  Repeat that to yourself.  Hard to believe that right now.  I\u2019ve seen this movie. \n\n* Feels like my heart will stop any second.  Have irregular heartbeat &amp; frequent palpitations.\n\n* Trying to understand what the irrational/intangible source of anxiety is.  Was on a spree before today, episode-free for eight months :/\n\n* Can\u2019t unclench my neck and back.  Tell myself to loosen up.  Minute later I notice I\u2019m clenched again.  Head\u2019s foggy.  I throw breakfast away, feel bad about it. \n\n* My HootSuite feeds are exploding with last night\u2019s Oscars highlights.   Am the only person who didn\u2019t watch the Oscars apparently. \n\n* LOL! Jack Nicholson videobombed Jennifer Lawrence.  What the awesome?\n\n* What helps, what helps?  Nothing.  \n\n* Biting the inside of my cheeks.  Tapping my feet rapidly.  Fucking around on Reddit.  Writing this?  Pacing around.\n\n* Thought Catalog piece pops up via HootSuite.  Pretty good piece\u2014relatable.  Left author nice comment.\n\n* Decided I\u2019m going to submit this to TC.  Who knows.\n\n* First time I don\u2019t like working from home.  If I were in an office I could talk to others, could distract myself, stand by water cooler?  Twiddle thumbs, idk. \n\n* heart palpitations, feelings of impending doom, clouds of intense anxiety overhead, like that mini heart attack when you miss a step, only constantly. I\u2019m alone, not good.\n\n* I like having anxiety attacks\u2026 said nobody ever. \n\n* \u2026Just looked at a long list of jobs I want to apply for.  Everything\u2019s worse :/\n\n* Thinking of my current job\u2026 not helping. \n\n* Tip: keep a running list of jobs you apply for/don\u2019t get.  In your group of friends make a game to see who wins with the highest number.  Form a prize.  Set an expiration date.  Game on.\n\n* I don\u2019t hate this job but don\u2019t love it.  Have some pretty cool projects to work on right now actually, start having ideas for them\n\n* Gonna put this on /r/depression if TC rejects.\n\n* Live blogging helps, staying calm/think rationally.  Really self-indulgent.  Putting thought to page.  Fact that I\u2019m forcing myself to live blog is making me calm enough to think.  Good. \n\n* Feeling really isolated/claustrophobic.  Having slight trouble breathing, have pain in my chest, in sternum.  This is a wave of that worse stuff.   Neck and back are fucking killing me.  Need to leave Apartmen\n\n* Lost my shit.  Cried hysterically for past 30 minutes, snot dripping into sink, tears falling, whole nine yards makes me feel a little better though\n\n* Got myself to a caf\u00e9, working from here for now.  Idle chatter/music helping a lot.  It\u2019s dark out, didn\u2019t get any sun.\n\n* If you\u2019re on Twitter check out @HaHaDepression, lol\n\n* I\u2019m really losing my shit.  Don\u2019t know what to do.  Another wave of the bad stuff again.   Thankfully took QPR training in college, it\u2019s helping...  Trying to see all this objectively.  Taking all my energy.  So fucking tired.  \n\n* I should delete this.  \n\n* Home again, really don\u2019t want to be here.  Wish I had a sig. other.  Really want to hold a girl, play with her hair.\n \n* Can\u2019t fall asleep.  Too on-edge.  So tired but I can\u2019t close my eyes.  \n\n* Went to store, bought vodka.  If I can\u2019t fall asleep I\u2019m going to pass out. \n\n* Going to try House of Cards on Netflix\u2014I\u2019m seeing positive tweets in HootSuite.  \n\n* TIL/FYI House of Cards not a good show to watch whilst having anxiety episode who the fuck suffocates a dog? powered through four episodes of HIMYM and half vodka.  Trying sleep again.",
