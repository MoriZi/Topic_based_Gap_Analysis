He was standing, acting aggressively and raising his voice. I started to cry. He asked me questions and when I told him I wasn't sure/didn't want to answer he began to bully me. By that point I was in full swing panic attack mode. Finally, my boss let me leave his office and I sat shaking and crying uncontrollably at my desk for over an hour.\n\nI guess my manager realized his erroneous ways and suddenly HR offered to pay me for the next two weeks if I left immediately.

But instead I became hopelessly consumed into the \"what-if's\". I had my first panic attack a few days ago, and that's when I started researching and realized I probably have some sort of anxiety disorder. I've made an appointment with a counselor, because I really don't want it to get worse. Plus, my stress level has been extra high, given that I recently got into a terrible car accident, my boyfriend recently found out that he's deploying for a year, and my boyfriend is going back to work for this company that practically made him get a DUI. On top of all that, I'm in law school. I'm at a point where I feel like I'm crazy and I don't have control of myself anymore. I wake up every morning and the first thing I feel like doing is weep. I feel like no one really understands and has sympathy for me and they just think I'm being stupid for not being able to deal with this and thinking too much at any given moment.\n\nThen I found this subreddit and realized that I'm not alone, and so many people are like me. The posts here have been really helpful, and they calm me down when I'm anxious. Thank you guys! ",

My SO has gotten me into watching the anime \"One Piece\" and insisted I watched it with the subtitles (Japanese-speaking, English subtitles). Initially, I was hesitant - I like having TV shows on in the background while I'm doing other things, and I don't need to concentrate fully. But with a show in another language, you have to pay full attention and read the subtitles to not miss anything. Which, for anxiety, I've realized is great! There have been points where I'll begin to get nervous or anxious about one thing or another, and immersing myself in One Piece where I have to really concentrate can alleviate some of that stress. Maybe this will help someone! :) ",

I have social anxiety because I think the rest of the world sees me in the same way I do; a pathetic loser. \n\nAfter a drink though, I can relax and I don't care anymore. I feel confident, my thoughts don't bring me down, I begin to feel aspirational like I'd do all the things I'd usually be too anxious to do, like write a book or a song. I talk to people, I'm in the moment.\n\nAnd I feel like I'll never feel sad again. I see my problems for what they are; imaginary. I have a new zest for life and I believe that my life has changed...\n\n...and then I sober up, the anxiety comes back, the feelings of inadequacy. All those plans I made become bad ideas and they give me a horrible feeling in my chest. \n\nSo then I just look forward to the next time I can drink. Friday night? Great. I'll get smashed and feel happy again. And soon enough being drunk is the only source of happiness in my life.\n\nAnd realising that is what made me stop binge-drinking. I haven't binge-drunk in about two weeks, and you know how I feel? \n\nFucking shit. I don't want to leave my apartment, I just want to stay indoors and watch TV. Just escape from the world. Every time I leave the apartment I just feel anxious. I feel like everyone is judging me. I can't socialise, I feel boring and that everybody thinks so. I feel like a drone; no emotion. I have this overwhelming feeling of dread hanging over me constantly.\n\nI thought quitting binge-drinking would magically make everything okay, as though that might be the source of my anxiety. But obviously I was wrong. I'm just an anxious person. I could so easily go out and binge drink tomorrow night, I'd feel happy for a while. But I won't. I won't because even though I feel terrible now, I'll only feel even more terrible. \n\n",

            "selftext": "Sorry, this is insanely long, and is probably going to get tangental at times, but I really want to get down everything that I\u2019m feeling at the moment. I\u2019ll try to title sections so you can get a quick idea of what I\u2019m spewing out.\n\nFor context, I\u2019m a 20 year old male college student from the United States.\n\nReligious views: You may as well call me an atheist. I sometimes consider the possibility of my consciousness persisting after death in some way (and if I\u2019d actually want that), but I get the feeling that when it\u2019s over, it\u2019s just over. \n\n**[The Incident]**\n\nSo, I have a lot on my mind \u2013 too much \u2013 that I need to communicate in some way. Periodically, especially when it\u2019s bed time, the lights are out and the room is quiet, my mortality hits me like a sack of bricks. It amazes me how I can live in a Western culture that so willingly exhibits death without actually acknowledging it. It\u2019s easy to crack a morbid joke or watch a snuff film, but we\u2019ve become great at abstracting ourselves away from death \u2013 we see it happening, but not to us. But I digress. When this mortal wrecking ball slams into my chest, I find myself having a panic attack of sorts \u2013 mind you, I\u2019m not clinically diagnosed with anything (yet), but we\u2019ll see when I speak to a counselor.  I usually have to get out of my room, grab a drink of water, and pace around with the lights on for 5 or 10 minutes, after which I am able to repress my fears and get to sleep. \n\nAbout 2 weeks ago, while not exactly sober (marijuana) I had one of these episodes. If I\u2019ve ever felt abject fear, it was this hellacious little trip. It was a painfully conflicting episode. I felt an immensely powerful urge to live, but I wanted to go to sleep to escape those thoughts while simultaneously fearing sleep, otherwise known as a \u201clittle sliver of death\u201d to quote Poe (you can thank my 2 week macabre Google binge for that one).  For whatever reason, the couch in the common area of my apartment became a source of comfort, and brought out a sheet to sleep on it. Thankfully my apartment mates didn\u2019t pry too much into that one.\n\n**[After the Incident \u2013 But First, A Little Background]**\n\nI\u2019ve been reeling from it ever since. I\u2019m currently stuck in a maddening cycle. Now would probably be a good time to explain my situation prior to this episode. I\u2019m a 3rd year computer science student, and I\u2019m not too keen on my studies. So far I\u2019ve mustered enough motivation to have a 3.49 GPA, but I reckon that will change after this semester. My motivation has been good job prospects for my field, and the joy that it brings to my mother and grandparents. I guess, like a lot of people do, I sort of drifted into what I\u2019m doing. I never programmed before my second semester of college, and did so on a suggestion from a friend because I quickly became disillusioned with the idea of being an engineer. \n\nI usually don\u2019t tell people this, partly because I\u2019ve found it\u2019s something kind of misunderstood by a lot of people and the fact that I feel like I\u2019m 10 depending on how I phrase it, but for several years I\u2019ve wanted to try my hand at auto racing. I started following racing when I was around 16, but never really considered doing it for a living. I was more focused on doing what everyone said I should be doing \u2013 focusing on getting into, and doing well in, college. It wasn\u2019t that I was opposed to the idea of college before going, but I\u2019ve found that for me it\u2019s not the oasis it\u2019s often touted as. My college is also notorious for bad weather, specifically winters, which doesn\u2019t help as I feel Seasonal Affective Disorder  may be amplifying my feelings. I guess I could change disciplines, but I\u2019m already so far along and there are not really any conventional collegiate career paths that I\u2019m particularly interested in. Racing has been and continues to be a rich man\u2019s sport (perhaps a bit hyperbolic in some senses, but it certainly takes a pretty penny to support a fledging racing career). My mother has put so much money into my education that I don\u2019t want to just piss it away. I have no idea if I\u2019m actually any good at racing, and properly trying to find out does not come without its cost. I don\u2019t know; maybe I\u2019ll finish my degree and try racing after I\u2019ve accrued some of my own funds. Or maybe I\u2019ll be over it by then and have found enjoyment in something else. Or maybe I\u2019ll drop out and find my way into racing. Who knows right now?\n\n\n**[After the Incident \u2013 Perpetual Existential Crisis]**\n\nSo I spelled out my desire previously, however whimsical it may be. I think about the potential satisfaction I could derive from it, but, as with everything in the last 2 weeks, it gets soured by the reminder of my mortality. I find myself cycling in and out of a nihilistic mindset. I think, yeah, I\u2019ll be doing something that is (hopefully) satisfying, but my death and the eventual passage of time makes it null and void. This nihilism makes me view things and people in ways I don\u2019t like. I sometimes look at people and don\u2019t see people but rather masses of organic matter driven to do what they do only by some biological directive abstracted by the minutiae we\u2019ve built into life as we\u2019ve progressed as a species. I see the way I think merely as my brain trying to cope with a threat (death) and being overloaded in the process. I feel that I and other humans lose agency, which only compounds my hopelessness. \n\nI also keep trying to reconcile enthusiasm for life with an acceptance of death. It seems like right now I can have one, but not both. Looking to an enjoyable future makes me think about losing it all to death. Feeling okay about death makes me feel like I want to go in that moment, when I\u2019m okay with it. Obviously, that doesn\u2019t happen and the cycle repeats.  \n\n\n**[Coping With It All]**\n\nI feel at times that it would help to get rid of some egocentrism. Yes, I know that the universe existed long before I did. I know that during that time of pre-existence, I had no complaints. But now I have consciousness and I know that, at some point, I\u2019ll lose it for good. When I\u2019m actually dead, I won\u2019t care much, since such concepts no longer have meaning. I know that what constitutes me, at least physically, will persist in some form. But right now I just don\u2019t care about all that. When I\u2019m feeling nice and meaningless, I remember that I have meaning to other people, but I\u2019m hesitant to put all my purpose into going on for other people. It just feels like something I can\u2019t maintain. Sometimes I consider committing purely to helping others (I plan to join some kind of community service effort to try to get a nice dose of perspective).  But that sentiment conflicts with what I think of when I think of what I want to do \u2013 race. I picture a racing career that eats up most of my time. I guess I could give part of what I earn to humanitarian efforts, but having those conflicting intentions makes me feel sort of guilty. \n\nI\u2019ve considered meditation \u2013 ego death and all of that. I started by going to a meditation club meeting last week, but honestly the whole thing felt superficial \u2013 I felt like I was full of shit for taking part and felt like the kids talking were full of shit. Then again, maybe I\u2019m just not used to listening to people express those kinds of spiritual ideas. And I don\u2019t know what the other kids there are going through. It could be genuine ideas from people genuinely looking for peace. Meh.\n\nI try to take my mind off death and let myself get caught back into the routine of mundane life. Trawling the internet for light entertainment works somewhat, but I\u2019ll often find myself opening a new tab to look up something death related. I want to tell myself that I\u2019ve thought enough about it, but clearly something is missing because I haven\u2019t really resolved this within myself.\n\nI try to tell myself that, if death is really just like a dreamless sleep, then it is a reprieve from the unpleasant things brought on by life. That just seems like such a defeatist perspective to me, though. If I rationalize it that way, I think \u201cCool, death will take me away from this living curse.\u201d It doesn\u2019t give me much motivation to actually live. \n\nSometimes it\u2019s not death itself that bothers me but dying. I think that I won\u2019t be aware that I\u2019m dead, but how aware will I be that I\u2019m on the cusp of death? Will I be acutely aware of my last breath, or will I be unconscious before I\u2019m actually dead? If I\u2019m unconscious before I\u2019m dead, will I, in my last moments of consciousness, know that I\u2019m in mortal danger? The idea of withering away slowly bothers me greatly (perhaps a product of growing up in a youth obsessed culture), and I don\u2019t know if life and experience will really help me to cope with those final moments, in which I imagine myself reviewing my life. The uncertainty of how I\u2019ll die leads to thoughts of suicide that, in some way, give me a measure of control in my death (That was hard to even type out).\n\nThe idea of dying a natural death alone bothers me, and I can\u2019t count on having a bunch of people around in my final moments (or if I\u2019d want to subject people to that). I don\u2019t want kids, as I\u2019d rather not risk bringing a person into the world that bears my genetics and has to deal with their mortality, especially not in the way that I am. And, as cold as this may sound, you don\u2019t miss what you never had.\n\nThere's one more part. I have to put in in a comment.\n\n",

It's like I'm constantly stressing and for no reason. I've been suffering from this for about 6 months now and I'm not what I would have thought an anxious person would be. Yeah sometimes I get panic attacks, thinking I'm having a stroke, but that doesn't happen too too often. I'm not nervous about anything, I'm not scared of anything, even when under pressure I don't freak out.

I've seen two psychs where one I was diagnosed bipolar. But the second psych ruled it out.

            "selftext": "I'll try to shorten this story as much as I can. Sorry for the length. I swear, all the points I make are important for the overall story!\nI have just moved to a small town for school and immediately looked up an animal rescue group that needs foster parents. I have fostered dogs and cats in the past and really enjoyed it. \nI got interviewed and approved to foster with a group and was excited. They send me an email saying there are some kittens available to foster and if I was interested I needed to contact Lady 1 and they provided me with her number. It was the weekend and I was working on a lot of school stuff, so I held off on calling right away. Suddenly, I get an email from Lady 1 who I have never met saying that she has these 3 barn kittens and can I take them? I didn't like that the rescue group just gave her my personal email, but brushed it off. We talk, I ended up with 3 kittens that evening.\nKittens were fine. They hid under my couch the whole time because they were terrified of me. Wasn't rewarding and they shit everywhere on the carpet.. Hadn't had to deal with that before, but I was understanding. I only had them for 4 days. \nAfter the kittens were gone Lady 1 is constantly emailing me, texting me and calling me about when can take some more cats. I tell her that I am busy with the last stretch of school and that I get a month off at Christmas and expect to take full advantage of it. She asks me \"where am I going over Christmas and if I can take cats with me?\" Ummm, no. I am not taking care of cats during my holiday. I tried to be polite. She continues to bother me and asking what the exact day is that I'm back from my holiday so that she can give me another cat?\nJust to clarify, I love fostering. I also love alone time. In the past when I fostered I would do it every once in awhile because it can be a lot of work and I'm 24, I'm still selfish and enjoy me time. I'm not about to give up my entire life to take in cats while I'm away at school.\nI e-mail Lady 1 letting her know when Im back from my holiday and explain politely to her that we may not be on the same page with the amount I'm willing to foster. As we are emailing back and forth I find out that she is not officially associated with the rescue group and that they just agreed to help her find some foster homes and that I am apparently her only foster home at the moment. I explain that I am more than willing to help out, but it definitely won't be constant fostering from me and that I am interested in fostering dogs with the rescue, not just cats. \nWhile this is happening I am not handling it well. I am getting anxious and flustered because I have to make it clear to her what my boundaries and limitations with fostering are. After awhile she is only writing back 1 word responses like \"sure.\" She ends it with saying, \"be careful with dogs because if you want me time you won't get any fostering dogs.\"\nI lost it. I took it as a jab. I deleted all her emails and got super anxious! Why the hell is she acting this way towards me? I never said I was on board to foster a million barn cats! She never asked if I would take more cats after my holidays, she just told me she has some available and needs to know when I'm back to take them. I'm not her partner in this cat fostering and she was acting like I'm on the same page with her on all this.\nVery frustrating. I love helping animals, so I feel bad for setting limits, but this woman is too much to handle, rude and not at all accommodating. Fuck her. I don't know where to go from here with fostering with this group anymore. \n",

I've had every cardiac test possible in the book (EKGs, ECGs, Stress Test, Heart CT, Heart Cath) and everything came back normal (with the exception of the stress test but the cardiologist felt it was probably the extra weight and not a blockage, which the subsequent heart cath revealed to be true). Surprisingly enough I actually have normal blood pressure. So I've been battling anxiety and health anxiety all during this weight loss process, specifically the fear that every little pain in my body or weird feeling is going to lead to a heart attack and eventually my death.  \n\nMy problem is basically I'll feel something off anywhere on my torso, whether it's a quick pain or whatever and I'll focus on taking self-diagnostics until it blows up into something larger. I just can't seem to shake the negative self-talk or focus on my body. So I thought I'd throw it out there to the public and see if anyone had any suggestions or resources.",
