            "selftext": "I'm 25, have had panic attacks and social anxiety since I was 16, when my friend committed suicide. I thought this was just the way my life would always be. My panic attacks, PTSD, social anxiety, and impending doom started getting worse this year; I was increasingly convinced I was going to die, or at least throw up or piss my pants in public. I had severe anxiety whenever I had to talk to anyone, and moderate anxiety just waking up in the morning, which could escalate to panic without warning. It felt like the world was ending. I thought I was going completely insane and considered dropping out of my grad school program and getting inpatient psychiatric treatment. But that didn't happen. Instead, here's what worked for me:\n\n1. **Therapy.** It was awkward and stressful and terrifying at first. Trust me, I had been avoiding it for so long. But I finally went, and kept going. It is seriously hard work, but when you are ready to put in the effort to be vulnerable and better understand yourself, it can be a transformative experience. I went once a week for 6 months, then twice a week for 3 months, and will continue once a week for however long I need to.\n\n2. **Acupuncture.** I know it might sound fancy or expensive, but if you go to a community acupuncture clinic, each appointment costs $15, which is MORE than worth it if you have disabling anxiety. Plus you get to stay as long as you want. It helped me so much, especially at the beginning when my body was in a constant state of hyperarousal and tension; acupuncture was the only thing that could seriously relax me. [Check to see if you have a community acupuncture clinic close to you.](https://www.pocacoop.com/clinics/) I went twice a week for a month, then once a week for two months, now whenever I feel particularly stressed or feel like I want to indulge in deep relaxation.\n\n3. **Finding something spiritual to ground me.** I'm not going to go into my beliefs, but it was something I was neglecting entirely. Once I had a renewed sense of spiritual presence, my anxiety (though persistent) didn't have as much terrifying weight, because I had more perspective on my existence as a whole. I don't care if it's yoga, stargazing, Buddha, Allah, Jesus Christ, mindfulness, running marathons, or bird watching, but find something that makes you feel connected to living life in a deep, meaningful way. It made my anxiety less important, though of course not any less real.\n\n4. **Being patient with myself.** I never expected myself to get better quickly. It has been 9 months of busting my ass to get to where I am. I've had to allow myself to just accept wherever I am in the process, including being frustrated and exhausted and scared and all that. This might be the most difficult part, especially for little old perfectionist me.\n\n5. **Taking care of myself physically.** I eat whole, delicious foods that make me happy and only drink water and herbal tea. I get about 8 hours of sleep a night. Being consistently physically active (walking, biking, practicing yoga) definitely relieves some anxiety too, but I think it's most effective when done in tandem with other treatments (evidence suggests this, too).\n\n6. **Watching these videos from the [Mindweather101: Navigating Mental and Emotional Distress](http://www.alloflife.org/Our-Classes/) \"class\".** The course is just a series of videos that you can watch whenever you feel like it (and it's free). One of the main ideas is that our brains are always changing. Thus even those of us diagnosed with a \"mental illness\" have brains with the capacity to change. Unfortunately, few mental health practitioners practice with this philosophy, even though there is tons of evidence on neuroplasticity. The class is about working with the attitude that you can recover fully from the mental health issues you are struggling with (like anxiety, but they tend to talk more about severe depression, bipolar disorder, and schizophrenia).\n\nI know that everyone's experience with anxiety is different, but I just wanted to share with you all to celebrate how far I've come and to encourage others to reconceptualize their anxiety as something they can grow past rather than something you always have to suffer with. Thinking about my anxiety with this hope and insight has helped me grow so much without using any pharmacotherapeutic medication. My therapist offered prescription antianxiolytics but I declined and said I would like to try without first. Sure, there have been many times where I wished I had a benzo in my bag to pop in my mouth when my social anxiety seemed unbearable, but I survived without and with a lot of hard work I no longer have that need. I am not saying this intending to make people feel bad for using medications, but I want people to know that *you CAN recover to a point that you no longer need meds*. Getting on meds does not mean you have to depend on them forever. No single treatment could have led me to where I am now, but with therapy, acupuncture, healthy spiritual and physical practices, that Mindweather course, and a lot of patience, I am panic attack free and have hardly any social anxiety. I feel less anxious and more joyful than I have in my entire life. I want to help others feel the same way.",

            "selftext": "Sorry for the wall of text, but I really need to vent and ask for advice. \n\nI'm a recent college graduate, just voyaging out into the working world. However, my anxiety and constant self-doubt are really weighing me down. There are two major problems. First, my current job sucks the devil\u2019s ball sack. Second, I\u2019m generally very insecure about my place in the working world. \n\nLet\u2019s start with the first problem. My employers are incredibly finicky and tend to make the smallest issues into huge catastrophes. For example, someone forgot to water my boss's office plant on Friday, and it wilted a bit over the weekend. MAJOR catastrophe, lots of finger-pointing and \"how did this fall through the cracks? This should be standard procedure!\" type emails. Now every time I get an email, I'm filled with a sense of dread that it's one of my employers, getting on to me about something I screwed up. If they turn such a stupid thing into such a huge deal, I'm terrified of what will happen if I do something seriously wrong (and I already have screwed up several times). A lot of the people in my office tend to be very rude and unsympathetic as well. My boss is a living stereotype: a very materialistic, sharp-tempered, merciless, go-for-the-throat type attorney. Frankly, I\u2019m terrified of her. She sees me as a bumbling idiot (perhaps justifiably), and has no problem showing it. I'm trying to see the humor in the situation (because after all, it is very ridiculous), but I'm too high-strung and paranoid. I\u2019m doing very menial work in a fairly toxic environment, so I don\u2019t intend to stay with this job too long. However, I don\u2019t want to be perceived as a quitter, and some part of me feels like maybe I\u2019m just being entitled, and I should just suck it up. I am young and have relatively little work experience, so maybe this is how I have to pay my dues to enter the working world. \n\nBut in general, I'm just very timid and insecure. I think part of it comes from a deep sense of self-doubt. I don't feel like I'm worthy enough for people to give me money for my services. Therefore, I'm incredibly paranoid about proving my worthlessness by screwing something up. I did very well in school, and rarely ever had these feelings of doubt, but now it\u2019s a totally different ball game. I\u2019m stuck in a rut where I feel guilty that I\u2019m not contributing anything valuable, so I try to overcompensate by being extremely cautious and meticulous, which stresses me out and makes me more prone to screwing up. I\u2019ve seen my coworkers make mistakes and bounce back, completely unshaken. How do they do that?? Whenever I make a mistake a want to curl up in a ball and cry about my incompetence. I\u2019ve been working there about a month, and there\u2019s still so much I don\u2019t know. I can\u2019t imagine how people go to work confident each day, knowing that they can handle anything that comes up. I am so far from feeling confident in this job, and I\u2019d love to hear how other people with anxiety deal with stressful work situations. Thanks for your help! \n\nTLDR; My job sucks, and I\u2019m very insecure about my performance. How do people gain confidence in their jobs? \n\nEdit: Wow, thanks so much for the advice and words of wisdom. You guys are the best! :)",

Being hopeless and reading articles about fitness/health, I decided to go out and just walk. That's all, just walk. I walked about 3 laps around my small neighborhood and it took about 45 minutes to an hour. It took my mind off all of the problems and paranoia and I felt great at the end. \n\nThere's a huge difference for me between the anxious state and the healthy state, in the anxious state I am very hypersensitive and every little thing connects the dots on a bunch of stuff that's barely even connected to each other. I start to worry. The worry and the anxiety causes little spurts of adrenaline and it upsets my stomach. The cycle continues.\n\nMake a change in your life and try to exercise daily, whether it be by walking or doing a marathon. Do what you find comfortable. I believe you can make the change just like I did and get rid of your anxiety :)",

            "selftext": "Hey guys,\nI wish I had a place like this to go to while I had anxiety and depression, it's an awesome support system, keep it up!\nI just wanted to offer some practical tips and ideas for getting through the worst of anxiety, depression, panic ect.\n\n1. Talk to your doctor. \nYou have a chemical imbalance that may or may not fix itself. There's no shame in considering medication. Taking medicine turned my life around, find the one that's right for you, I tried three before I found one that doesn't make me hazy.\n\n2. Talk with the ones you love. \nEven though it's hard at first, I found huge relief in explaining exactly how I was feeling to my close friends and family. Also, from talking with them I found a surprising amount of them had at one point had some of the same feelings I was having, which made me feel way less alone.\n\n3. Watch kids movies. :)\n It might sound funny but it helped me a lot. \n\n4. Be active enough that you want to go to bed at night.\nFor me, anxiety caused a really unhealthy cycle of staying inside all day, not being tired, laying awake in bed because of anxiety, sleeping in, repeat. Even though it feels like the hardest thing in the world to do, go outside. Walk around, exercise, go to the store, even just driving around. \n\n5. Wake up everyday and choose to fight it.\nThis might not be for everyone, but for me, part of getting better was going from being a victim to a fighter. If you have it, you know it's a battle. It's the hardest thing I've ever experienced. So rise above it, be brave, choose to live on in spite of it.\n\nI'm rooting for all of you :) it will get better, keep fighting.\n\nSorry for the wall of text.",

I posted something similar on r/depression as I suffer from both anxiety and depression, but no one's seemed interested so far =).  \n\nI see so many posts about different medications (and I have been on sooo many over the last 10 years) and they've helped me tremendously.  I don't know where I'd be without them.  But I'd like to have a baby so I have been working on trying to either reduce or get off them over the last 6 months.  It's been a nightmare.  Some days I couldn't get out of bed.  My anxiety at work was so bad I couldn't concentrate so I had to keep going back up to my regular dosage.\n\nI'm very luck to have a very forward thinking doctor and he suggested that I try CES.  It's a small machine (little bigger than a cell phone) that you attach to your earlobes, wear some glasses and put on a headset.  You start a program and the light, sound and small (non painful) electrical pulses to your ears all pulse in rhythms to regulate your brain waves.  There are actually a lot of studies on it and it's considered a safe alternative therapy for anxiety and depression.\n\nI don't know if everyone responds well to it (I was the guinea pig for my doctor; he's now trying it on all his patients) but my mood is better, I have energy and drive and I can go to work without teetering on the edge of a panic attack.  And this is with reduced meds!\n\nAnyway, I hope this doesn't come off as an advertisement.  My response to it has just been so drastic and it's helped me so much that I want to make sure people are at least aware of its existence.  It's not cheap (my unit cost about $400) and you should have a doctor who is familiar with it to guide you, but, for me at least, it has been amazing.  I had pretty much given up on the idea of a baby since I figured I was stuck on the medication, but now I have hope again.\n\nIf anyone has any questions, please post.  I'm happy to share my story and more details about CES if anyone has any interest.  I've read all the studies I could find =). \n\nBest of luck to everyone here!",

            "selftext": "No, this isn't an attempt to sell you some herbal remedy that ends up making your testicles itch.\n\nI have suffered, and I don't use that word lightly, from social anxiety since I can remember. Even being a kid I look back and I was nervous about sitting next to girls and making new friends, and the problem never really went away. \n\nI'm on track now though, and once you begin to notice the anxiety dissapate it's one of the best feelings you'll ever have. And it's possible, for every single one of you, it's achievable.\n\nThe most obvious first step is to go see your doctor. Nothing new, everyone will tell you this. It's hard but listen. Therapy is a fucking God send and some meds should help you tackle the physical symptoms so you don't sweat like a peadophile in a nursey every time the pressures on. It'll take time, a few months, but better that than be anxious for the rest of your life right?\n\nNow, a couple of other things that will help. Meditation. It's not pseudo-scientific bullshit, it will help you turn the volume down on that negative inner voice that tells you to crap your pants when a girl smiles at you. Close your eyes and focus on different sounds you can hear for a minute each, then focus on your inner voice for 20 seconds or so. Differentiating between the two is the aim, so eventually your focus will remain on whats in front of you and you won't be hearing the voice that wants to panic. Try 15 minutes a day. Every day. This is like excercise, you won't wake up overnight with a six pack but you'll notice improvements over time. And then you'll want to do more!\n\nAnother tip is if you're nervous before a certain situation i.e. interview or presentation or anything, go to a private area where no one will bother you. For two minutes, make yourself as big as possible. Stretch arms, legs, look up, impose yourself on the space you're in. This sounds nuts yeah? So take some time today to watch a TED talk, only fifteen minutes, on 'fake it til you make it'. It sounds far fetched yes, but this really helped me, and if you believe it will help you then it will do the same for you too.\n\nCan't imagine many of you got this far, but if you did, please at least consider what was written here. I'm still anxious, I still worry alone or in front of people, but I don't feel like anxiety dominates my life anymore. It's good to worry a bit, but don't let it stop you from doing what you want.\n\nThanks, I hope this helps at least someone!",

I immediately went into panic mode, my blood ran completely cold and I felt sick. No-one in my life knows about my anxiety apart from a few very close friends, and I hovered over the little thing that shows who could see that 'like' and it said 'PUBLIC'. Shitshitshitshit. Still, at least I only liked the website, right? Nope. I followed the link and I turns out I somehow accidentally managed to like every single post on a thread on an anxiety forum about someone being afraid because they had a patch of dry skin on their leg and they suffered from hypochrondia.\n\nI quickly unliked every post, but the damage was still done, that had been up for a whole month and I didn't know. I feel totally humiliated. If someone could help me feel better about this, I would be very thankful.\n\nEDIT: thanks for everyone's awesome comments. I am much calmer now!

I've been overwhelmed with regret lately, thinking of how different things could have been if I had attacked my problems head on 5, 10, 20 years ago. Anyone else go through this? Thanks in advance for any advice.\n\nEDIT: Thanks for the helpful responses so far. My therapist warned me when we began some months ago about how most people feel worse before they begin to feel better. Maybe it's unusual for it to have taken this long for that to happen, maybe it isn't. But I do believe that it is a sign that the desired effect is to beginning to take hold, so I have been able to keep up some optimism. ",

I was diagnosed with generalized anxiety order a few years ago but I've had it all my life, usually manifesting as a constant state of worry, ocd tendencies and constant feelings of failure. \n\nI have a 3.9 GPA on a 4.0 scale, am editor-in-chief of my campus newspaper, am working this summer for a very well known national newspaper and also a small-time community paper. It's my dream to be a journalist but it's so damn stressful. \n\nNo matter how much I realize I need to start writing ASAP, I worry and stress out and procrastinate, and all these feelings compound on top of each other until I'm a curled up heap of nerves. I've made it through the summer okay so far, but I keep finding myself increasingly fucked each week. \nI sometimes wish I had a shit job where nobody would talk to me, like a night janitor or something, so I could do my thing, make money, and pursue my passions on the side. But I'm talented and have a killer resume. Everyone has high hopes for me, including myself, but I'm scared success won't be fulfilling. I fight off nihilistic feelings daily. \n\nA big part of this anxiety is that I'm scared to death of graduating. This is the last year I'll have any semblance of a childhood. I don't know who I am anymore, much less who I'm going to be. I feel like so much of my identity is based on being a young person, and now that it's time to be a responsible adult, I'm scared of losing who I am. This is a life transition that scares the living shit out of me. \n\nAnd finally, to top it off, feeling this way and procrastinating myself into a shit hole every week makes me feel incredibly lazy, irresponsible, and undeserving of the opportunities that have been given to me. I'm so tired of feeling guilty and scared and anxious and like a crappy human in general. \n\nThanks for reading. I needed to get it out. I'm currently sitting in a mall atrium eating a pretzel in avoidance of tomorrow's deadlines. Sigh...",
