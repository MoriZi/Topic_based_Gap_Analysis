I got a lot of responses to starting this anxiety support group, so I thought I would make a more solidified post about it.\n\n\nThe project is called \u201cJust Breathe\u201d. Basically, this will be a list of people who all have some form of anxiety or panic. You can sort of think of them (as well as yourself) like a \u201csponsor\u201d.  We are here to contact one another in times of need.  I know we can't always talk to our friends and family because they can only sympathize with us, but not really empathize.\n\n\nWhat I believe to be special about this anxiety group is that we created an \u201canxiety bio\u201d. The bio will allow you to talk to someone who actually can RELATE to you because they have the similar fears and triggers. Remember, no anxiety is too small or too big. Whether you have anxiety over bugs, flying, social interaction, etc. It is all legitimate and never stupid or silly. \n\nEven if you do not feel comfortable being contacted, you can still be a part of it! You will be put in the group with no contact info available. You may contact other members of the group if you need support. You can also decide at any time if you would like to make your info available for others. You may also be removed from the list at any time. \n\nYou have the option to be anonymous. You may just use your Reddit username as your contact info, instead of an email address. You can be removed from the list at whenever you would like. Just ask. \n\n\nYour information will be stored as a DropBox document. The only people who have access to this list, are the people who have been invited to view it via email or given a specific link. The document will be updated whenever a new members would like to join or whenever someone would like to opt out.\n\n\nThe more people involved the better, the more support there will be!\nIf you would like to be part of the group, please message me on Reddit or email me at justbreathereddit@gmail.com. I will need the following information from you:\n\n1. Name you would like to go by.\n2. Geographic location.\n3. How you would like to be contacted. Note if you do not want to be contacted by anyone. \n4. Anxiety bio. (just a little info about yourself and your anxiety)\n\nThanks!",

There are a lot of horror stories, especially if you Google, about kids who took some tokes and then had \"brain problems\" or the like. There's also people who complain of having done permanent damage.\n\nJust know this--these people have anxiety problems. Weed is good for some with social anxiety and the like, but it can also be an anxiety trigger...especially for those who have hypersensitivity anxiety. \n\nAnxiety, especially acute physical anxiety, is a terrible cycle caused by a trigger...something that puts you in a full panic, which raises your mind's awareness of a state that it's not used to (or, is out of its equilibrium). When you experience a panic attack, it's kind of like your mind leaves auto pilot and you are suddenly grabbing for the controls. You freak. Panic attacks are very energy depleting and traumatic for the mind. This causes negative thinking and fear, as well as fear of the physical change you feel, which causes more fear, negative thinking, end so on. \n\nEventually, panic attacks start a cycle of daily worry, stress and exhaustion that doesn't normally occur to a calm body. This is a manifestation of physical anxiety disorder, which will be tabbed as \"GAD\" by general doctors. I've been to so many different types of visits to assure myself. \n\nBut, what assures me is that my first anxiety trigger happened a year ago when I used a harmless menthol solution that I used to fix a sore lip. Yeah-- it caused the same panic attack and a 5 month long battle with completely foreign and frightening symptoms that I had to fight off each day. I quit drinking, began exercising, etc. I won that fight and spent three months feeling like $1 million. I felt AMAZING! FREE!! SOOOO DAMN HAPPY!!!\n\nNow I'm fighting the same fight again thanks to a mistake with some weed...but it's the same fight. So, hopefully this calms anyone who has had any type of substance trigger GAD. It's hard to accept and understand the problem...and many who don't are the ones writing the horror stories on other forums.\n\nAcute GAD can be caused by one panic attack, and that panic attack can be caused by a number of triggers. There's dozens of anxiety symptoms that are mental and physical that are all related to the same problem. If you don't attack what's attacking you, you will get nowhere. \n\nBut...there's a reason weed is being legalized, and so many use it with no problem. It doesn't do anything like that to the brain...your anxiety is doing that to you. It was just simply caused by a scary situation. \n\nNot saying smoking can't trigger full on GAD...it can. But, ANYTHING, if it be a negative to your mind, can trigger this cycle of panic and anxiety disorder. Just know you are dealing with the same documented medical issue that so many of us have...and not same rare, unreversable problem that has doomed you. So many seem so discouraged because of that thought process.\n\nKeep calm y'all. ",

One thing that is STILL a huge roadblock is making a decision, no matter how small or simple. This is especially the case when potentially hurting someone's feelings is involved (i.e. my perception of potentially hurting someone, sometimes that's skewed) or if I believe I am making the wrong decision. For example, I've been seeing someone who wants me to make a road trip to visit him this weekend. I totally could, but completely over think the pros and cons of doing so, making me a completely anxious mess and I freeze. This generally turns into not being able to make a decision until I absolutely have to. But being anxious I also like being prepared so... it's just all over the place. \nDAE experience something similar? How do you deal with it?",

Either contacting this person via reddit, email, text, etc.. when you are feeling really bad or just need to talk.\n\n\n\nI have awful anxiety about many things. Health issues is one. I have an extreme fear of vomiting (which is emetophobia). I also just have GAD. It can be sparked for no reason at all. \n\n\n\nEven if we are not always available for one another, sometimes just knowing someone else is listening is all you need. Instead of just Googling it and reading other peoples anxiety stories from '05. \n\n\n\nEdit: I have titled this project \"Just Breathe Reddit\". It will basically be a sponsorship program of sorts. I will create a newsletter and send it to everyone who has provided their info. This info will ONLY be used for the people who have allowed me to use them. This list is for everyone who needs a little help sometimes. Whether you are in the middle of a panic attack or not, you CAN help (and someone can help you!) You can help someone else by just listening to them and relating to them. It doesn't matter how big or small. We all have to be there for each other. Everyone MUST be kind and not dismissive. If you think you would be unable to counsel someone during a stressful time, please alert me of this, so I may make a note that you should not be contacted. \n\n\nAnyway, we got a good list going so far! I will send the email out by Friday. I will also keep the list updated as I get new people who are interested.  This is going to be great! We are not alone anymore. \n\n\n\nSend me an email at justbreathereddit@gmail.com or message on Reddit with 1. Name you would like to go by. 2. email (or reddit username) 3.

            "selftext": "Hi all, \n\nI'm a 26 old student driver from mainland Europe, and I'm just so tired of being afraid to drive a car.\n\nI'm not really sure if this is a common fear, but I certainly feel weird to see my peers and much younger friends drive around so casually, while I can't keep my stomach from becoming uneasy at the mere thought of having to *drive* somewhere.\n\nI don't know why I have it, I've been in some small car accidents (without being at the wheel), but nothing major and never felt shock of any kind. So it wouldn't stem from that I'd say.\n\nIs anxiety genetic? I have had some hard times getting to learn to drive with my father, who's a bit of an OCD person himself, and quite the pannicky, pessimist (always assumes worst case scenarios). Could that have influenced me or 'taught' me this fear?\n\nEven then, I'll try to mitigate any chance of failure by metering out each and every intersection on my way on Google Streetview, even though it's all pretty bland and straightforward. Still, it seems to ease my fears a little, but I'm afraid that might become a habit I won't be able to shake (eg realizing I wouldn't dare to drive if I hadn't planned it all out). Note though that I'm not yet accustomed to just driving places, while a lot of people can drive to places almost on command. Furthermore I usually don't have a GPS with me.  \n\nIn trying to combat it, I've tried some breathing tricks, like the 7-11 method (7 second breathe-in, 11 second breathe out) the difference in time has an automatic calming effect on me. \n\nAlcohol also reduces the fear, but obviously prohibits me from driving.\n\nI don't want to take any medication, I'd be frowned upon as everyone here seems to expect the 'ideal' family, and having to break with that image would dent my image even more. I don't know if talking to a professional would help, as it only manifests itself when I'm confronted with driving.\n\nI try to go driving at least once each day (tried to go for one hour each day, but that's a bit much at the moment), and I can drive, shift and get where I need to be, but the fear keeps coming back. \n\nStill, once I get driving, I usually calm down pretty quickly and don't do too badly either (although I make some small mistakes now and then, but I know my traffic rules). That's why I wonder why this fear keeps coming back, I don't want to be afraid, I just want to drive a car like my 18yr old niece and my 78yr old grandma can.\n\nAny ideas on what else I could try, or people who have faced similar anxiety related situations?\n\nI'm a bit conflicted on whether I should accept said fear, sometimes I feel like I can trick myself into forgetting I have it, and then it won't rear its ugly head and I feel more relaxed. But if I remind myself of it (involuntary triggered by a random thought), things often get harder than they should be. So that makes me wonder whether I could perhaps force myself to forget I have such a fear?\n\nThanks all!",

I won't lie, we've had a tough go at things due to my jealous ex boyfriend, but other than that, things have been amazing between us.\n\nSaturday, he called and said he wanted to go look into buying some hookahs and asked me to go with him. I told him I would as soon as I got done eating, which would be in 30 minutes. I called him as I was walking out the door 30 minutes later and he had already left without me and was already at the store. He said he didn't want it to get too late and miss out on being able to go. \n\nI was irritated, but held my tongue. After that, he said he wanted to stop by a friends house for 10 minutes and then he would pick me up so we could go out. I waited for an hour or more and then called him. He was still at his friends house, so I told him to stay and we would hang out tomorrow morning. \n\nHe said he would come get me so we could go to church together.\n\nSunday morning, I get up, get ready, and he never showed, or called. I went into a panic at this point and my mind was going over stuff like 'Well he's mad at you, he doesn't want to be with you, that's why he didn't spend time with you yesterday, etc.\" Vicious cycle and all that.\n\nI tried to stay rational and thought that maybe he had just over slept and didn't set an alarm or something. He lives less than 5 minutes away so I drove by his house. His car wasn't there. More panic.\n\nLater, he calls me and says that it was because he was helping someone do something, lost track of time, and had left his phone at home so he couldn't call me. He knows I have an anxiety disorder and said he knew I would be upset. I told him how I felt and that this kind of thing, where he says he's going to do something and doesn't, can't keep happening. \n\nHe thinks that I'm overreacting, that I have trust issues with him, and that I need to get ahold of my anxiety. He says he understands that I have problems but he doesn't want to deal with me 'freaking out' and 'getting emotional' on him, because it 'happens every week over nothing' and that it's 'scaring him away.' \n\nGuys, I am terrified. I honestly feel like my anxiety is taking over my life. I wouldn't wish how I feel on my worst enemy. I'm in therapy, on medication, and doing everything I can on my own but it's going to cause me to lose someone I care about so much and I just don't know what to do. Any advice?\n\n\n",

There was a death in my family and another member dealing with cancer. I had a stressful school schedule (I'm 21, in university) and some heart problems (I apparently have an abnormal rhythm but it's nothing to worry about - found this out after 4 months of worrying). \n\nAfter I found out about the potential heart problem, I went crazy. I worried about my heart beat ALL the time and then I started to worry about my breathing. Even AFTER the specialist cleared me, I still haven't been able to relax. I feel like I'm constantly on edge. And ever since this stuff started happening, my digestive system seems completely out of whack. I'm either constipated or plagued with loose bowels (not usually diarrhea though). It seems no matter what I eat or do, I can't bring my system back to normal. I also just got a new full time summer job, am finishing a summer school class (which I have missed 2 weeks of because of this issue) and have had some relationship issues in the past few weeks. \n\nI went to a doctor about it a few months ago and he felt around and asked about my symptoms, and basically told me it's stress related. But I'm STILL worried I have colon cancer or something. I have always had a serious phobia of vomiting but now I'm terrified of shitting my pants too or something. ",

It was like nothing I have ever experienced. I went through it and  finally calming my self down by telling myself  that i was just out of it and it was just the weed. A couple of weeks later I had an other attack than was caused by nothing i mean i was playing resident evil 6 and turned it off. As soon as I went to go lay down on my bed I started to feel the same way as I did before my birthday and didn't know what to do. I was so dizzy i threw up and just went to bed and closed my eyes but images were just shooting through my head until i finally just calmed down and slept. I'd say about after the new year my fear of dying progressed. I mean i never really thought about death until the attacks. as soon as I would feel pain anywhere in my body I just felt like I was closer to dying. Pains in chest, stomach aches, random dizziness, shortness of breath i just couldn't handle it. I would annoy my sisters of constantly asking them to help me calm down or me asking to go to the doctor. I got prescribed meds for it but I'm scared to take them because i don't want to think differently i don't wanna be in a dull mood i don't know if that's what happends but that's what i think it does. i also hate being alone mostly because I think I'm going have a heart attack or something and no ones going to be around to help me. my sister is planning a camping trip and I don't Know if I should go, Is it a good idea to go? Does anyone else feel this way?  Thank you for reading.",
