An hour or so before I was supposed to meet them I almost talked myself into not doing it. But, I did it and it was amazing. I had almost nothing to say. They asked if I saw them in December and I told them I had my ticket to go but had a massive panic attack and literally couldn't leave the house. \n\nIt was such an incredible opportunity over all. I can't believe they came back so soon AND that I won a contest to meet them. I let my anxiety stop me from going the first time but this time I forced myself to go and it was honestly one of the best shows/experiences I've had so far. They are very nice people and if you're into metal, I strongly suggest checking them out :P Hopefully they come back to Portland next year when their new album is released. My reddit user name is actually a song of theirs, Starchild, which was the last song played!\n\nDon't let your anxiety consume you. I have off days, a lot of the time. But I feel like this was huge for me as someone who suffers from panic disorder, social anixety and agoraphobia. ",

            "selftext": "Growing up, my biggest fear was moving away to college. All my fears were confirmed during my first year when my anxiety became so pronounced that I started going to therapy and was diagnosed with GAD. Prior to this, I thought I was just sensitive and a nervous person. Nope. This brought about new fears about travel and adjustments and being away from home. I was terrified for my second year but time really does help and I was able to have an amazing year. I never thought I'd ever take part in any study abroad program because of my anxiety. The thought of flying across the world (already have a fear of flying as it is) not knowing anyone and living there for 4 months (longer than I have ever spent away from home) made me sick to my stomach. But after my first quarter of my 2nd year went so well, I decided to apply. Fast forward to spring, I FREAKED about it. I was into the program and set to go in august but almost dropped out because of the fear. But I knew how bad regret feels so I stuck it out. I was scared all summer but managed to get through the flight (thank you ativan) and made it here without panicking. I thought I'd wake up the next morning in a panic like I usually do when my mind is still in a nervous mess. But I woke up feeling fine and ready to take it day by day. \n\n\nIt's been a week now and I finally got time to be by myself in London today. I went to the Kensington Gardens to write in my journal and listen to music. I sat on the lawn looking at the sunset in front of Kensington Palace and while watching geese and birds fly by, I realized....I'M FUCKIN' DOING IT. I made it here. I'm facing that fear. I'm stronger than I thought. I made more progress than I thought. I thought I could never do this but I did it and I'm gonna continue to do it till it's done and there's no more \"biggest fear.\"\n\n\nhold on. you're stronger than you think.",

They are doing freshmen welcoming events right now till Monday and I have not gone to a single one of them, including meals( also mention that while I am hungry, the second I think of going out that hunger inverts into a upset stomach ). Now I am taking meds for my anxiety (gabapentin 300mg twice a day,bupropion sr 150mg three times a day), while they do help deal with my physical symptoms, they don't remove them and do little for the mental ones.\n\n I think the problem is how little social experience I have. My entire life things tended to be done for me, even when I was asked a question my mother often butted in and answered it for them. But i'm on my own now, I have to do things for myself. Even when I could have done things by myself I didn't, I would like to avoid it instead hoping I would either get someone else to do it or hope I won't need it.\n I have a tendency to brake down when talking to strangers, the analogy i often use, the pressure a normal person feels giving a speech to thousands is the same I feel ordering from McDonald's. I'll get a clear plan in my head, go through it a lot trying to perfect it and when the time comes to try it, it collapses. I'll stutter one of the first words, mispronounce others and my mind goes in emergency panic mode because my plan failed. After that I'll end up talking fast and rambling in a nervous kind of voice. I'll always feel awkward in this situation, from the very first stutter I feel like I'm making a fool of myself. Because of this I try the hardest to avoid social interaction. I'll let people walk over me in order to avoid it. There is a school counselor I was supposed to go to, but I can't even will myself to go to her,\n\nI'm also rather disappointed in myself, college was something I was looking forward to my entire life. A place where people actually wanted to learn, and would actually learn useful things. But here I am, crumbling apart, half of me wants to go home and hide in my room, the other half is shunning the first one for trying to ruin my dream.\n\nI'm not really sure what I should do.I emailed the counselor to see if they could help but I didn't get a response yet. I haven't eaten anything real for 3 days now, I'm hungry but that feeling goes away when I try to open my door to leave. Along with this constant internal conflict I have no idea what to do and just end up spending all day in my room.",

I missed their show in December because I literally could not leave my bedroom. I was on my way to leave, stepped outside and started crying and came back in and hid under my blankets... Honestly, one of my biggest regrets. I couldn't believe I let anxiety ruin something like that for me.\n\nToday I got an e-mail telling me I had actually won. Of course my excitement level was through the roof at first but then it kind of started to sink in and now I'm VERY worried about having a panic attack and from there I just spiral into possible scenarios or outcomes. What if it happens and everyone notices? What if it happens and they think I'm weird? What if I'm asked to leave? Then I think things like, well maybe I just shouldn't go.. I forget to think of the positives and can't reassure myself. \n\n\nThe last year has been a real struggle anxiety wise. Sometimes I can't leave my house, a few times its so bad I can't leave my bedroom. A few months ago I told my therapist my anxiety was getting better and I was having fewer panic attacks and eventually we determined it really wasn't better, I just avoid any situation that could trigger a panic attack or that might cause an increase in my anxiety. So, hello agoraphobia!\n\n\nTuesday I went to this metal show/event called Summer Slaughter at the same venue and it wasn't bad. However, I had taken more ativan than usual. I'm not scared of the venue, venue is fine. I would be fine even being around so many people in a tiny, crowded place (where I start to think crazy things like what if there's a shooting... -.- ) without ativan. \n\n\nI just fail, completely fail, in social situations. Funny thing is, I notice it or at least think I notice it but no one else ever does. Sometimes when I get more comfortable with people I mention it and they tell me they didn't notice it. I don't want to miss out again, the fear of a panic attack is very real to me. Especially since I'll actually be meeting them.\n\n/endrant",

Seeing people committed to helping one another really hit me in a positive way. Thank you.\n\nI was diagnosed with severe anxiety and depression. I would break down and cry, no motivation or energy to get out of bed, I could not meet new people, I would have a panic attack, and so on. I took Sertraline, 2 anti psych meds and a sleeping medication for 3 years.\n\nI first started moving about when I had a sudden realization one night: **\"I have to do something with my life, I have try to enjoy life. I have nothing to lose and everything to gain\"** I wanted to go out, I wanted to have fun, to have friends, to smile like how I see people on social media. But how could I do it if I couldn't even talk to a person? to put it shortly, I kicked myself in the ass. I forced myself.\n\nI took the first step with **online chatrooms** it didn't matter where it was, if there was a person I can talk to regarding anything, I'll try it. I started with a simple \"Hello\" and I would get a panic attack before they can even reply and disconnect. But I kept at it. The pain and anxiety going through that was excruciating, but then again, what else do I have to lose? It soon slowly seeped into me, talking to people online. A couple months later I slowly started moving to video chats, I would instantly disconnect upon seeing the person, but then again, I kept at it. After 5 or so months, I applied this to real life and my comfort level slowly leveled out. I cannot stress how bad I've felt through the process. It's a grind. \n\nThrough this painful and scary process, I went from the person that cried getting up from bed, have strong panic attacks seeing people, to a person that can go out and live a normal life. I recently got together with the girl of my dreams. If I can do it, so can you. I believe in you. Test yourself, learn to love yourself. (I teared up having my first real conversation in years to a person because I was holding in anxiety)\n\nI'm apologize for this being very poorly written. If you have any questions, please don't hesitate to ask privately \nor here.\n\n**Edit:** Present day, I found myself to be able to befriend strangers and keep up online webcam chats for hours. I found techniques to maintain a conversations when lost. The most important thing to do in my experience is ask questions. It's lame but the format I used would be : Relate to the question you're about to state -&gt; ask the question. If not in person a example would be \"I'm not doing anything at the moment. Rolling around in bed, you?\"",

            "selftext": "EDIT: Forgot to put in the title that this was cross-posted to /r/depression as well.\n\nThis is a throwaway account. TL;DR at the bottom.\n\nI [M/25] have been on Lexapro (10mg) for a little over one year. I went on Lexapro after being hospitalized for anxiety and depression/PTSD. The anxiety and depression were triggered by the end of an emotionally abusive relationship, which brought about a lot of self-analysis, which brought up a ton of other issues in my life that I was unhappy with (career path, finances, re-surfacing memories of child abuse). I spiraled into uncontrolled analysis/anxiety/suicidal ideation/unhappiness. Essentially, my depression manifests as workaholism/self-improvement-aholism... Can't turn off the brain... I had been in therapy for 5 years prior to all this, so I am pretty self aware, but still have a lot to learn.\n\nNow, a year+ later, I am doing much better. I am starting a new job that has tripled my income. I am in a much healthier place with my family, who regret their actions when I was a child, and I am dating a guy who is kinder than anyone I've ever dated before. This guy actually came to see me in the hospital when I was voluntarily committed. We were just friends at the time, but he knows what he is getting himself into, so-to-speak. I still spend much of my day working and tackling side-projects, but I have learned to take a break every night and simply \"have fun\" / relax.\n\nLexapro has been a great help, but I'm tired of being a different person. I don't have as many emotions. The range of emotions is smaller. I also went from being extremely high sex drive to having zero drive at all. It's only gotten worse over time. I added in Wellbutrin to see if it would help, and it has not. I'm ready to be off of all drugs, slowly-but-surely.\n\nI tried coming off of Lexapro once before and when I attempted it I thought it would be a piece-of-cake because I was feeling so great. I went from 10 mg to 5 mg and after a week or two I felt very anxious and had some crying spells. I went back on my full dosage because I was very busy at the time and needed to focus more than I desired being drug-free. I was also single at the time, so being non-sexual was not bothersome.\n\nThis time around I want to come off of the drugs because I want my full range of emotions when I start my new job. I want my slightly-anxious \"type A\" organized tendencies to come back which help me excel at work. I also miss having sex and as nice as my boyfriend is, I know that he misses sex too and it's getting to him. My last psychiatrist also told me that coming off at some point is good because if I ever relapse, I can go back on to 10mg instead of increasing my dosage. It keeps my \"arsenal of drugs\" a little more open.\n\nThis time around, I went from 10mg to 7.5mg by cutting tablets. I was at 7.5mg for a week and a half. Then I dropped to 5mg a few days ago. Last night I really noticed the difference. I have been having an increase in obsessive thought behaviors (mainly about my ex boyfriend, which is definitely obsessive since it's been 1.5 years since the split and we haven't spoken in nearly 8 months. Also, he was abusive in many ways.). I am also more irritable and notice my current partners flaws much more than I notice his good traits. I am constantly debating if this relationship is for me (which isn't something I would have been doing a few weeks ago), and I'm worrying that I am getting in over my head and that the relationship will never work out. My boyfriend is upset with me that I am self-medicating without the help of a psychiatrist. I am mad at him that he won't just trust me. This is probably sparking the obsessive thoughts about leaving him. All of this is happening in my head, and I don't want to talk about it because I don't want my anxiety to be a burden. So instead I am much quieter than normal, and he notices that. He asks what is wrong, and I tell him it's just side effects.\n\nEssentially, I'm not being present in-the-moment and I am having more and more cognitive distortions come up in my head. I also have had some nausea and dizzy spells, and a few \"brain zaps,\" but nothing terrible.\n\nI am planning on staying at 5mg for a little while. I don't have health insurance right now until my new job starts so I don't have a psychiatrist or a psychologist right now. I plan on staying at 5mg until I get a psychiatrist who can help me reduce my dosage further. I am simply posting this for some emotional support and hopefully so that people can reassure me that these side-effects are real and that I am not \"crazy,\" and that it's not \"all in my head.\"\n\nI also wouldn't mind advice on dealing with the side effects and advice on seeking out new mental health professionals. Ideally I wish I could just see one person who would perform talk therapy and also diagnose drugs if I needed them. If anyone else out there has depression that is similar to my own, (workaholism / self-improvement-aholism) I would be curious to know what kind of talk therapy has helped you?\n\n**TL;DR:** Been in therapy for five years. Took Lexapro for the last year+ to help with anxiety/depression/PTSD. Want to come off. Second attempt. Decreasing dosage slowly. Feeling what I think is withdrawal: tired, dizzy spells, increased obsessive thinking and worrying, melancholy, etc. Advice? What works for you besides drugs?\n\n \n\n",

Well that's definitely not true! I've heard giggling from strangers. One time an asshole friend (sitting a few rows away from me) even got up from his seat so he could look at me and laugh (at least I'm not taking classes with him anymore!). Another time, in a very small and quiet classroom, friend was constantly looking at me in pity saying things like \"poor you, that must be so embarassing\" etc. Of So people DO notice! It also gets painful. I can't focus in lectures anymore, and it's going to make college difficult for me if I don't get over this. I've skipped lots of lectures simply because of the silly stomach thing :( \n\nI know that this is entirely psychological. It never happens anywhere else, only in classes and lectures where it's quiet. It has nothing to do with what I eat. If I stay home instead of going to class, my stomach is completely fine. Does this happen to anyone else? Any idea what I can do about it? I know the key is to NOT worry about it but I have no idea how!\n",
