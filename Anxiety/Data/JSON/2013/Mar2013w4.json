            "selftext": "Someone once dropped the phrase \"wrong side of 25\" in a conversation I was having about relationships and age gaps. Details of the discussion aside, the implication was obvious; the difference between your early 20s and late 20s is significant, much like the difference between your early and late teens.\n\nI spent most of 2012 on neither side of 25 - rather right in the middle, an experience that only served to cement the meaning of the phrase for me.\n\nI imagine I'm not the only person beginning to realize that adulthood isn't really a threshold you instantly cross once you get a degree and a job. That omniscient quality that our elders once seemed to possess was really nothing more than a facade, as if they were trying to guide us in the right direction only to reassure themselves through our successes that they themselves had found all the answers. The wisdom we gain with age isn't a sudden culmination of their efforts, but it\u2019s the result of our own trial and error with our friends, our coworkers, and the other relationships we foster in the \u201creal world\u201d. And one day we might seek to validate it by passing it on to someone else.\n\nI spent the last year teetering on the edge of a second adolescence. Part of me kept holding on to my college years, a time when consequences were trivial and mistakes could be laughed off. The other part believed that I had finally figured myself out and that the decisions I made were the manifestation of my newfound status as a \u201creal person\u201d or an \u201cadult\u201d or whatever ambiguous term I held up to the mirror that morning. But at the end of it all, I found myself unable to identify with either person. Someone said to me this year, \u201cI liked you better when I thought you had it all figured out.\u201d So did I.\n\nIt was equally as hard to find myself in reflections of my friends, as so many people in my generation are either reliving their college years in the city, married and settled in the suburbs, or struggling just as much as me to find their place in a world that was as unprepared for them as they were for it. We\u2019ve all been standing on our own two feet for some time now, but there\u2019s rarely a hint of stability or uniformity in our gait. We can at least find comfort in knowing that we\u2019re not alone in our confusion.\n\nIt\u2019s hard to tell if next year I\u2019ll find myself on the \u201cright side of 25\u201d. I made a lot of mistakes this year, but no more than I did over the last five years. To think I\u2019ll suddenly figure it all out and become an adult over the following months would only further the same misconception I\u2019ve been following thus far.\n\nI took a big step this morning in addressing uncertainties about myself that I\u2019ve yet left unanswered, and I hope not to have to follow through on it alone. I\u2019m still struggling to find any indication that I\u2019m not merely a teenager who knows how to behave in public, but I doubt it will come from a single event or epiphany. I may be an adult in terms of my age and the responsibilities handed to me, but those aren\u2019t metrics by which I choose to judge myself.\n\nI\u2019m an adult because I\u2019m told to be. I\u2019m an adolescent because I feel like one. And I\u2019m a child because I learn like one.\n\nThere is no single definition or identity to which I can relate. Our 20s are a journey and our personalities are malleable. Our experiences may be different, but our questions are the same. What matters through this journey is that we foster the relationships and opportunities that allow us to bring ourselves to the table and learn from what we see. I\u2019m fortunate to have the friends that have been with me for so much of my life, and I\u2019m fortunate to be able to define myself by my own terms.\n\nIf one day you wake up and suddenly realize that you have all the answers, let me know. I promise I\u2019ll take good notes.\n",

I don't go out anymore and avoid confrontations. Well apparently, my fucking family that I never ever see or really like are staying in my room. I normally wouldn't mind, but that has become my sanction recently. I sit in there and have my crying panic attacks in peace blasting music. But now some people that I don't even care for are staying in it and getting all up in my business. I had a conversation with my mom and she told me to \"come out of my shell\" and \"deal with people\" and to \"grow up.\" It's not that easy. You really think I could just all of a sudden be okay with people invading my space. I don't even like to go out with people, you think someone in my space will be better. If it was easy I would freaking do it. So, sorry I'm not going to \"come out of my introversion personality.\" Fucking thanks for the support mom, glad to know you're so concerned with my well being.

But every night when I come home from work, I'm full of anxiety about facing them. \n\nIn December 2012, I lost a steady, great paying job of 2 years to \"downsizing\". I have since found employment, but it's not the same. It's through a placement agency, which has caused me nothing but stress, and the pay isn't even close. But it's something to survive on and I know that, but something deep inside of me feel its not enough. \nAs a result of losing my last job, I fell behind on a lot of bills, car insurance included. It ended up being cancelled. I worked out a deal, however and thought all was going well after mailing in my small first payment. Wrong. They never received it, and it's caused me so much anxiety, I completely shut it out, forgetting all about it. My wife asks me about it often, and I have mini panic attacks every time. \n\nBasically, what I'm trying to say is I'm anxious of facing my anxiety. It's affecting my relationship with my wife and kids, causing me more anxiety. I so desperately want help, but again, I'm afraid I may have another panic attack. \n\nAll this anxiety stems from ( what used to be) a small case of Agoraphobia - the fear of large crowds or open spaces (large crowds for me) and its gotten worse as I've gotten older. I had a panic attack in fucking Costco of all places.\n\nTL;DR - I'm panicking about everything, and it's worsening over time. I want help, but I'm too anxious to seek it out. It's ruining my marriage and I'm becoming a less attentive father because of it. ",
