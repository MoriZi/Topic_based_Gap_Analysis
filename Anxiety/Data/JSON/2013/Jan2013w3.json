I was in a particularly busy sub with all sorts of different subscribers. I made a comment about having borderline personality disorder and was in tears when I read the reply. \"Then kill yourself.\"\n\nI fight with that everyday. I know that trolls will be trolls, but this time it really got me. I wished for that second that the troll could feel how I do. I wished that they could wake up the next day with BPD. I know the anonymity of the internet is *why* the trolls say these things, but at that moment it didn't matter. \n\nI've spent years on Reddit and was very proud of my Karma and comments. I helped a lot of people through their problems with open arms. (Which I still intend on doing.) But, the one time I comment, I am told to kill myself.\n\nI gave in to the troll and deleted what I worked so hard to achieve. Now I feel like kicking my own ass for letting them win. I am having a pretty bad week with my BPD and feel like perhaps, there's someone else out there who has been through something similar. Even if you don't comment, thank you for reading my little rant. Please don't take what the mean users say to heart. It's not worth it. If you are one of those trolls, shame on you. You've obviously never had a taste of what it's like to fight for your life.\n\n*edit*: I can't thank you all enough. All of these comments made me so happy! Most of all, they helped tremendously.

I refrained from doing extensive research, so I wouldn't stress myself out thinking about side effects and what could go wrong. In the past week, I've felt awesome. The only side effect I've noticed is a loss of appetite, which is not bad at all. I know that it's not supposed to fully kick in for a few more weeks, but I can say that I haven't had any panic attacks, I've slept through the night, and I am able to stop myself from drowning in my worry. \n\nAnyone who is hesitant about seeking help, muster up your courage and go for it. Medication and doctors were a huge source of my anxiety, and I had to overcome that in order to even begin to get better, and it was so worth it. I can't wait for the next couple months so I can see how much better I'll feel. ",
