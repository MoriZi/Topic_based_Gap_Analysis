Anyway, it's a kids show that deals with a lot of concepts from Buddhism, among other things.  This past weeks episode was amazing and I thought it was very fitting to the world of anxiety...  Here's a quote that I thought fit perfectly :)\n\n\"In the Spirit World, your emotions become your reality- especially for the Avatar, because you are the bridge between the two worlds. You must try to stay positive.\"\n\n\"Even in the material world, you will find that if you look for the light, you can often find it. But if you look for the dark, that is all you will ever see.\"\n\nHmmm... okay well it definitely loses something in translation.  Anyway, check it out if you want something uplifting to watch!

            "selftext": "I am 20 years old now, almost 21. Im scared of life. I havent even driven a car, even though i own and restored a 68 mustang with my dad. I just cant do the unknowns. I want nothing more than to be able to get into my car and drive around the city and pick up friends for a change, but it seems impossible. I was diagnosed as having an anxiety and severe panic attack issue at about 15. I saw a therapist for over 5 years and it really helped for a day or so, but I lost my insurance about 4 months ago. So the doctors cant see me because I am already in to much debt with them. So I lose my access to my klonopin, prozac, and hydroxozine. I found a clinic that has refilled my prozac but wouldnt refill klonopin for 3 months of visits. So... hardcore klonopin withdrawl, 4 mg a day for 3.5 years to cold turkey. I wanted to die, but i dont give up like that, i do love life. I actually could have died and the doctors didnt seem to care about me. I just havent gotten out of the deep deep hole that I went into after that withdrawl experience and the original anxiety ontop of the \"old days\" panic attacks. \nI am in college and have done great up until this end of the year, i can barely get out of bed in the morning and half ass everything with no interest. So about 3 weeks ago i decided im just going to push as hard as I can to be happy. I go play basketball with friends the next day and the first lay up, my knee dislocates and i land full weight on the bottom of the same leg. Broken leg/chipped kneecap without insurance, so now i owe more money then I have got in the last 5 years and i feel like im falling deeper and deeper into this pit. I try meditation, breathing exercises, diets, and my love Cannabis. All of these work to an extent and cannabis works like my klonopin but happier. I do have asthma though, so my cannabis smoke is expensive and not as frequent as it was when i wasnt in crazy debt to stay healthy. So i do fiend for my weed or klonopin now. Ill go weeks without cannabis and now klonopin for about 3 months. I just want this ache in my stomach to be relieved. Now im stuck on the third story with a broken leg and no elevator. Im so done with living like a piece of shit that has nothing to give, because i know i can get out of this and become a great and productive person. Though i do doubt it constantly when im in my head at night. ",

            "selftext": "Hi,\n\nIt was recently explained to me that what I am currently experiencing is 'Depersonalisation', as a result of years of anxiety. From what I've read, the description of dp is on the whole accurate, especially the deadening of emotion, to the point where the anxiety itself doesn't seem to manifest either emotionally or somatically anymore. Rather I'm just zoned out 24/7 and pretty much nothing affects me. This I am starting to understand and come to accept.\n\n More worrying for me of late (I have only recently started to address these issues, having previously thought the dullness I was experiencing was part of my personality) is the cognitive toll it has taken. It feels like my mind is blank for large portions of the day. I lack creativity, organisation, clarity in my thinking, that is when I am thinking at all. My memory is atrocious across the board, whether it be short term, long term, relating to facts/dates/names/things I've read literally 5 minutes ago. My ability to process information has declined significantly. If I am listening to someone speak, I hear the words but I am not registering what they are actually saying, not understanding. I come out of a lecture and am hard pressed to recall what exactly we've been talking about. I also get a feeling of intense pressure in my head after trying to concentrate and take in material. Not like a headache per se, it's difficult to describe. It's making things really hard for me academically.\n\n There's two levels to it, the depersonalised me is apathetic to it all and just goes about his business, uncaring. But then there's what I consider to be the 'real' me (who hasn't surfaced in sometime), who would find the subject material interesting and would love to think about it and talk about it and explore it further. I often think of myself like this. Divided. I have had brief periods of (relative) clarity and have felt closer to the 'real' me and I can only describe those periods in one word: elation. These periods were mainly brought about by a short period of using Aniracetam, though and the effects wore off after a few months. I've read up on DP/Anxiety a bit and these specific cognitive effects (specifically the blank mind, which is very concerning) are not mentioned all that much. Does the emotional deadening go hand in hand with some of these cognitive deficits? By working on reconnecting with my emotions (with the help of a counsellor), will it lead to improvements in my mental functioning? Would medication be of use in such a situation? I'd love to hear your thoughts. I'm 21 and want to make progress, but it's all a little overwhelming right now and I'd love to get your thoughts on this.\n\nI really appreciate any response to this.\n\nThanks :)\n\nEDIT: formatting",

My heart starts beating fast, my hands feel cold, and I'm once again that little girl that used to be abused by everyone.\n\nWhy can't my anxiety go away? And why can't I stop being a victim of things that are long gone?",

            "selftext": "*I know this is really long but I just need to get it off my chest, You can skip all the fluff and read the last paragraph if you'd like. There might also be some trigger warnings in here (self harm/suicide)*\n\nI started my first semester of college in August. The week before I moved I felt great, I was ready to go and get out of the town I grew up in. My anxiety was no where in site. The college that I moved to was six hours away from home and I wasn't bringing a car so I was basically going to be stuck there for a while. Move in day was awful, I was throwing up on and off all day and my boost of excitement from before was gone. Once everyone left and It was just my roommate and I, I started to relax a bit more. For the first 4 days I was there I didn't eat a thing. I tried to force myself to eat but then my anxiety would rear its ugly head and tell me to stop. \n\nThings eventually got easier. Once classes started I was pretty preoccupied with my work. I was making friends surprisingly and everything was okay. My roommate and I had met on our schools website and we had a lot in common so we decided to request each other to room together. She was a lot different in person. I could tell that she lied about a lot of the things that she had said on that website but I tried to get along with her. About 3 weeks into the school year I had my first panic attack. I found out that my roommate had been saying stuff to other people about me and frankly I couldn't believe it. I confronted her about it and she starts crying and apologizing and such so I forgive her. This happens about 4 more times after that and I just tell her i'm done. Theres been numerous times that she had tried to kick me out of my room and tell me to move out so I told my RA about all these things. My roommate never came back that weekend and on monday she started moving all of her things and she was gone. \n\nTwo days later I have a knock on my door. Campus police say that they had an anonymous call stating that there were drugs in my room. They had to search through everything and found nothing. The cop just looks at me and says \"You look really nervous, If you have anything just give it to us\". OF COURSE IM NERVOUS. I don't like cops in the first place so the second I opened the door I just think \"oh shit\" and my hands start shaking. Im almost 100% sure it was my old roommate that reported me. \n\nThings start to die down and now we are up to last weekend. My youngest brother was turning twenty one so my dad came down with him so he could celebrate with my oldest brother who lives in town. Every time that they would drop me off to go back to the dorms I feel like I died a little inside. I felt like I was being put back into a cage that was far too small for me. My head literally felt sick and that if I were to open my skull up my brain would be green. I hit a low point. I cut myself that night. I haven't self harmed in about 4 years so this was a huge thing to me. The past week I had to force myself to watch a movie or occupy my mind so I wouldn't hurt myself but that night, I couldn't take it anymore. \n\nThe next day was the dad that my dad and youngest brother were leaving so we went out to lunch and back to my brothers apartment. I lost it. It feels like each time I have a panic attack it gets even hard to deal with. I just wanted to curl into a ball right then and there and just disappear. I couldn't go back to school, that place would kill me. So I told my family everything. \n\nGetting help is the hardest thing to do, trust me but if it is a matter of life and death they need to know these things. If I would have stayed there for another week I don't know if I'd be here today. I'd rather drop out of college now that to risk failing it or killing myself. Anxiety is the gateway drug to other mental disorders. I thought for the longest time that it was my anxiety making me feel this way but looking back at it now I have developed depression as well. I packed up my things and left that school. The second I walked in the door of my house I felt so much better and know I made the right decision. Telling someone that you want to kill yourself is one of the hardest things to do but its also the smartest.\n\nTL;DR: Getting help doesn't make you weak. The only thing that matters is that you stay healthy. ",

            "selftext": "   I have been suffering from anxiety for some time now, it seems like it has been getting worse every day. I have a fear of almost everything and would rather just sit at home most days(but I get scared being alone) I also have a hard time talking to people especially when trying to tell them how I feel. I was sick with a cough/sore throat and went to the doctor. While I was there I thought it would be a good time to talk to her about my anxiety problems since they seem to be getting worse. She gave me an anti-biotic for the cough/sore throat and I told her I had left over cough syrup from early this year when I was sick that I could take so I didn't need that. She also prescribed me Cymbalta for the anxiety and suggested I go talk with someone. \n\n  The next day I get nervous about taking the Cymbalta. I read up on it and looked at the side effects. I have been on various depression/anxiety meds in the past and they have all made me not care about anything really. I was worried about not caring about things and gaining the weight ( 115lbs that I just lost) back. So that day I made an appointment with a psychiatrist thinking that he could help me overcome my fear of taking the Cymbalta and talk with me some.\n \n  Yesterday I went to see the psychiatrist and it was horrible. I was already nervous about going but it turned out worse than I thought it would be.  It was the worse experience with a doctor ever, I ended up having an anxiety attack, crying almost the entire time and leaving before our appointment was over. \n\n  When I arrived at the office I filled out some paperwork and asked for the restroom. The nurse showed me to the bathroom and said they needed a urine sample (they supposedly do it for all patients over 10yrs of age and its only to monitor the prescriptions they give) so I gave one. The nurse then took my blood pressure and I mentioned that I had taken the cough syrup last night and it would probably show up and he said it was no problem. I then get showed to the psychiatrist office.\n\n  As soon as the psychiatrist walked in he asked me a few questions (name, if I was married, had kids, etc..) then he says your urine test showed positive for opiates, tell me about that. So I explain to him that I have been sick for the past week and had a cough and I took some cough medicine that I had been prescribed earlier that year. He then becomes very accusing and I guess you could say suspicious of me. (his facial gestures and the way he was talking) He starts talking aggressively and it made me feel uncomfortable and scared so I start crying. He then says why are you crying \"as soon as I questioned you about you being positive for opiates you get upset\". He goes on the say \"why would a doctor prescribe a codeine cough syrup when there are other options. That's absurd!\". I even offered to bring him the prescription bottle that has some cough syrup left in it.\n\n  I continue to try to make the appointment work. I try to explain to him my anxiety over taking the Cymbalta (but I often have trouble conveying my feelings) and he cuts me off saying \"you had no problem taking opiates did you?\".  He ask if I have ever taken Xanax and I said yes, he then said \"you aren't/weren't prescribed to Xanax either, are you?\" I said no I'm not prescribed it but the dentist gives it to me when I go for dental work because that's one of my fears. I then described what all they give me for dental work and he responds with \"wow, you have a high tolerance, hummm..\". Then goes on to say that opiates and benzos are far more dangerous than Cymbalta or any of those medications.\n\n  He says \"lets be honest\" then goes on a rant about how he would never prescribe Xanax, klonopin, etc. for anxiety with out trying to fix the problem with other non-addictive meds first instead of just treating symptoms. I just kept telling him I wasn't asking for anything and that I just was trying to find help overcoming some of my fears and my fear of taking the medicine. He still couldn't understand my fear because I was having an anxiety attack, I was uncomfortable, and I was scared (making it very hard for me to communicate). He said he is a Medical Doctor not a therapist and that he is only a prescriber. I apologized and tried to explain that I didn't realize this.\n\n He told me that therapy wouldn't work well for me and it would only help after I got on meds/for the long run. He said he could prescribe be Vibram (sp?) but if I was just going to look up the side effects when I got home it would do no good. He said that I should've just took the Cymbalta because I should trust the doctors. He also said he was typing a report of our meeting so that he could send it to my GP (I could understand him sending them a notification of medication changes but didn't think he could send a report of the entire session.). After I realized this doctor was not going to work at all for me I said I had to go a started to walk out. He called the receptionist saying that I was leaving. She asked him why and he responded with \"she tested positive for opiates\" and her response to that was \"ohhhhhh....\" while she watched me walking out. It was embarrassing and it has made my anxiety worse. \n\nDon't really know where to go from here. What should I do?",

Figured you guys could probably relate. (Sorry for the wall of text, but I hope you'll give it a read!)\n\nAs I was driving home from school today, I was sitting at a red light when in the corner of my eye I noticed a big, weird black bug crawling on my car, right along my driver's side window. My window was rolled up but I was super startled because it was right next to where I was resting my arm. I'd never seen a bug like it before in my life, it was a little bigger than a US quarter.\n\nI immediately started freaking out. As the light turned green, I tried to accelerate fast in hopes it would fly off the car. But instead it kept crawling, right past my window and out of my range of vision. I was really freaked out and proceeded to have a panic attack, crying and feeling claustrophobic in my car the rest of the way home. \n\nWhen I got home I told my boyfriend (who does not have a problem with anxiety) what happened. His response: \"So? It was on the outside of the car, you were fine.\" \n\nI said, \"But I don't know if it could have gotten in through any of the cracks in my car. What if it came in through the A/C vent and blew onto my face? I turned the A/C off to prevent it but what if that just made it easier somehow for the bug to crawl in? What if it came out in the heating vent and landed on my feet? What if it crawled up my pants leg? What if it was hiding in the crevices of my side-view mirror? What if it laid eggs in there? What if it laid eggs in my A/C vents somehow? What if there was already a colony of those bugs living in the car? Does it bite? Does it sting? Can it fly? Do they get any bigger than the one I saw? Is it poisonous? What if it got inside and jumped on me and I swerved into traffic and got in a wreck and died? What if I got in a wreck and killed someone else? What if it was hiding on the outside of the car and when I opened the door to get out at home, it jumped on me? What if the entire outside door was covered in a swarm of those bugs but I just couldn't see it from inside?\" I couldn't stop rubbing off my legs because I could swear it felt like bugs were crawling on them.\n\nMy boyfriend is super awesome and supportive but he was really shocked because none of those things would have occurred to him. He would have just said, \"Huh, well at least it's on the outside\" and not given it another thought.\n\nAnd that's the difference between having anxiety issues and not.",
