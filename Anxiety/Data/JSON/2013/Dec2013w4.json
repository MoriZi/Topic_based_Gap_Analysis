            "selftext": "  I just feel a little bit bad because I have finally learned how ignorant I have been when it comes to anxiety. All throughout my life I never knew that anxiety is a diagnosable mental illness that can be treated medically. I always thought that anxiety was a state of mind, an emotion like anger or joy, but not a mental illness like depression or schizophrenia. This was not by any intentional harm on my part, but I grew up hearing it referred to in that way.  \n  \n  It has not been until recently that I learned how wrong I have been. I finally sought help for my depressive episodes I have been experiencing and my therapist referred me to a psychiatrist and that I be treated for depression and ANXIETY. The moment we began to discuss it I began to realize that I am constantly consumed by my anxiety. I have panic attacks and deep rooted fears of doing or saying the right thing to others. I avoid social interaction and all stimulus that triggers these panic attacks and have all consuming anxiety to the point that getting out of bed is the most difficult part of my day. I thought all these things were just a part of my personality and that I just needed to accept that I am less than others. Things that seem so easy to others is a battle for me every single day. It is very obvious to me now that anxiety may be the root cause of my depression.  \n  \n  After meeting with a therapist I have found this subreddit and have been educating myself and I am so appalled that I have been so misinformed.  \n  \n  I would just like to apologize to be one of the many people who have been misinformed about this condition. I would also like to sincerely thank you for the hope that you have given me as a subreddit that I am not alone and that this CAN be treated. Many of the posts I have read here have moved me to tears because I have never related to anything as much as I do to everyone here and I am so grateful to know that I can get better. It won't be easy, but I now know that it is possible.  \nThank you so much for reading.  \nEdit: formatting",

            "selftext": "So, Christmas Eve morning, my partner and I got last-minute asked to host since his parents and sister had no power (Toronto ice storm), and we did.  I panicked.  Big time.  I just wanted everything to go perfectly and started flipping out that I'd ruin it.  We came up with the idea that I'd build a nest.  \n\nI built my nest in the bedroom.  It meant that if I had to excuse myself due to mounting anxiety and panic, I'd have everything I'd need right there.  In my nest I had:\n\n* fresh, cold water\n* a clean, made bed\n* smoothie - I can't get food down when I'm anxious but can often do smoothies or V8\n* phone - for calling my mom or the crisis line\n* books\n* laptop AND CHARGER\n* crackers\n* a bowl, for the nausea - if it has to be dealt with, deal with it in private\n* TP - for wiping up my mouth in case of nausea\n\nJust knowing it was there made a **huge** difference.  I knew that I had a safe place to go with all the things I need to feel better, and that I could make a quick, quiet escape if need be.  There were a few white knuckle moments, but all in all we had a nice time and his family felt festive, warm, welcome and happy.  Which is what I wanted so badly.\n\nWhat this lead to was - **nest on the go**.\n\n\nWe packed up my nest and brought it with us to my parents' place the next day.  I was so soothed by the thought that my nest was immediately deployable, that I had my laptop, could access the forums and various breathing technique and visualization sites, had water, crackers, etc - we didn't even need to deploy it.  Just knowing it was there was enough.  \n\nJust thought I'd post in case this helps someone.  Build a nest, and one for on the go!!  They are customizable!!  What would you put in yours?",

In the past two weeks I have been in the ER from a panic attack and been officially put on medicine to help get my anxiety back under control. \n\nLast night I came home from work grabbed a Christmas cookie and sat down on the recliner. My cat jumped up to greet me and I pet her before she jumped down. A couple of seconds later she seemed to be attacking on of the wrapped presents under our tree and then ran next to the chair. I initially laughed thinking that she was just being goofy but it was immediately apparent that she wasn't moving. Within seconds I watched her let out her last breath. I was in shock, I still am.\n\nI don't know how to deal with this I just want to cry but I can't. I still don't want to admit that she is gone.",

I'm 25 and 2 years ago my dad died from liver failure.\n\nMy aunt is a very strict person but comes off as nice. She's in her late 60's and is a court judge. We have never had any type of altercation before. Right now, she's in a town with some family members on her side of the family that I haven't met before. She calls me and wants me to talk to them on the phone. I talk to the two relatives over the phone for a couple minutes each. I thought it went pretty well. One of them actually said \"You should be here taking down shots with (other family member).\" And I said \"Heheh..yeah I guess so.\"\n\nAfter our conversation ended, I expected them to hand the phone back to my Aunt so I could say bye. They didn't hang the phone up, and immediately they start talking about me:\n\nAunt: \"SO WHAT DID HE SAY??!\"\nRelative one: \"He said he was excited about Christmas\"\nRelative two: \"He just gave me a bunch of BS and that was it\"\nAunt: \"See. I told you!\"\nRelative two: \"Yeah\"\nAunt: \"He's the hardest person in the WORLD to talk to. He doesn't even drink and sometimes he...\"\n\nAnd at this point I immediately hang up the phone fearing they would see that I'm still on the other end. I don't know what the hell is going on. I have never heard anybody, or any family talk behind my back before like this, immediately felt sick to my stomach. I don't drink because I hate alcohol. I'm not the most social person in the world but I don't think I'm a complete mute either. I feel like shit inside.",

            "selftext": "I have dealt with substantial anxiety for the last decade or so (I'm 33), and as with many of us it has manifested in different forms. In the past couple of years I have found my way into a couple of relationships (the first 14 months and quite serious, the second 3 months and counting). These have been the first serious relationships in my life (kinda took me awhile). I have noticed that anxiety has played a very challenging role in pursuing a healthy relationship, and while that should not surprise any of you I am curious to hear if anybody else has struggled with it in the same way as me.\n\n\nBasically, I have a lot of trouble feeling \"sure\" about my feelings for my partner. Mostly this comes in being worried that I don\u2019t think they\u2019re attractive. Even though I was obviously attracted to them in my desire to start dating them, and I can even name numerous times I look at them and think about how pretty they are. And in both cases the sex has been quite good. But I constantly develop this fear that they aren\u2019t attractive enough, and then I start hyperanalyzing them. If in any one moment they don\u2019t seem that pretty it freaks me out and I take it as a sign that I\u2019m not really attracted to them. I know this is neither fair nor realistic, and that overall attraction to somebody is a much more continuous/subtle/ongoing thing. Nobody is going to be beautiful to you 100% of the time. But I think I look for that certainty and because I can never find it, I freak out pretty hard.\n\n\nI have other issues in terms of needing to feel \u201csure\u201d. I just get a lot of anxiety thinking about any next steps; from getting more serious to saying \u201cI love you\u201d to moving in together, etc. I think too hard asking myself \u201cis this REALLY the right person for me to do this with? Am I REALLY sure I want this? What if it\u2019s a mistake?\u201d. My last girlfriend I was absolutely in love with, but when it got to the stage of telling her that I really freaked out and suddenly started being worried that I wasn\u2019t attracted enough to her, and that if I felt these doubts how can I love her? But the fact was I definitely did love her, and for the four months we had been together I was absolutely attracted to her. \n\n\nI know this all boils down to my inability to deal with all the uncertainties of life. And lots of introspection and therapy is helping me see the negative talk that is taking place. And I am trying to work on this, but it is continuing to make my relationships difficult and I am eager to improve. With that in mind, I\u2019d love to hear if anybody else has dealt with these concerns before. And if you have, and you\u2019ve managed to work on them successfully, I\u2019d love to hear your story.\n\nThanks!\n",
