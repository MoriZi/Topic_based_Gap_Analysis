I wish I could just let it go.\n\nI go over what I said, how I said it, if I smiled/laughed enough, if I made good first impressions, etc...It's really stressful, and I feel like I'm self-obsessed.\n\nI had a lot of good moments, but there are a few moments where I wonder if I acted okay.

            "selftext": "Hi guys,\n\nI've had anxiety since I was 17 (I'm 25 now), so about 8 years. It was very bad for 3, then died down a bit, then came back after smoking some weed in Feb.\n\nI read a book called \"At Last A Life\" which I can honestly say has helped me understand anxiety a whole lot better than ever before.\n\nHere are some of the crowning bits of knowledge I've learned.\n\n1. You are NOT going mad, you are just a sensitive person with anxious thoughts. That's perfectly okay. Many people have strange or upsetting thoughts every day, however, we are so sensitive that we get worried or upset about these thoughts. It's this reaction to the thought that causes anxiety, not the thought itself, so (as hard as this can be to do), just ignore the thought. If you think of something awful happening, just say \"yeah, grand. This is just an anxious thought. Whatever\".\n\n2. Anxiety can't be gotten rid of like a flu, but it can be managed so well that it feels like its gone. \nOne of the best things I've learned is that I will always have anxiety, I am by nature of a nervous disposition. But that's okay with me. I am learning to be okay with it, I have stopped fighting it. I don't beat myself up about it and I move on each day. In essence, I am reducing my anxiety about having anxiety. \n\n3. Deep breaths. You can't panic and relax at the same time. You can control your breathing which in turn controls your heart rate. When you get that sinking feeling of anxiety, take 10 nice long deep breaths while repeating the following: \"I am a good, I am kind, I am okay\". This will give your mind a positive message to focus on while you slow your breathing and relax.\n\n4. Stop trying to figure out how to control or stop anxiety. You continue to give it more power which increases its hold on you. Accept it.\n\n5. Remember that an anxiety attack is a release of adrenaline into the body. Your mind believes there is a threat so it releases adrenaline into your system to help your caveman body deal with it. This was great when the threat was a cheetah but not so great when the threat is a thought you can't run away from. But understanding what the panic attack is allows you to relax slightly. \nSo when a panic attack starts, realise that this uncomfortable sensation is just adrenaline rushing around your body, it can't hurt you. Although it is uncomfortable, nothing can happen to you. The adrenaline will stop soon and you will feel better.\n\n6. Apparently 1 in 10 people in America have anxiety. You are not alone and you are not as isolated as you feel. You are one of many who feel this way so don't feel like you are all alone and the only one who feels like this. You are perfectly normal and this is going to get better over time. As you learn to deal with it, it gets easier and this happens with time. It won't be gone tomorrow so don't put pressure on yourself to fix it. \n\n7. Buy the book I mentioned above. It goes into great detail and is written by a guy who dealt with anxiety for 10 years before he learned how to deal with it. \n\nI wish you well guys. Remember that people with anxiety tend to be very nice people who get upset because of their thoughts. That just shows what a lovely bunch we are. Those horrible thoughts of you doing something bad, having something bad happen to you, bad things happening to other, worries about the world, economy, exams, etc, etc are only just thoughts. One you learn how to control your reaction to them, you will learn how to control your anxiety. Hope this has helped!\n\nLove to all!\n\n\n\nEdit:\nI'm glad to see that this post has helped so many people over the past 8 months. I would like to add a new point to the list which is my favourite so far.\n\n8. When you begin to feel anxious and get that sinking feeling in your chest/stomach, you probably feel like you want to run away. This is normal but we all know that running away from thoughts doesn't really work. The technique here is to sit there and say to yourself: \"Okay, Welcome back anxiety. I am going to sit here and be as anxious as I can for the next 5 minutes. I am going to feel every anxious feeling and I am going to try and be the most anxious person in the world\". Remember back to point 5 that anxiety cant hurt you, its just a sensation caused by a rush of adrenaline. Sitting there and trying to feel anxious removes all of its power and gives you back control. Its the opposite of what you've probably been doing so far isn't it? It really works for me, I realise that I am in control and that I am not afraid of feeling this way. The feeling dissipates and I am left feeling really delighted with myself! ",

An analogy I like to use for social anxiety is as if its a super power; the power to be able to suffer in all situations possible.  To keep this short, I have been working with a great new therapist (whom I had to be forced to go to) and she has greatly helped me understand just what I needed to do to help myself.  Social anxiety made me so so afraid of doing the \"wrong\" thing; or behaving in a way that would bring up social conflict.  This brings up its own massive mental chaos of its own. Learning to be 100% ok with who I am *right now* can make all the difference in the world.  Its ok if you do something wrong; nobody every judges you as much as you judge yourself.

            "selftext": "I haven't struggled this much in a long long time. Today I tried to eat crackers and was afraid of dying. So I drank broth made from a bouillon cube. Let's be honest, I probably felt like I was dying because I got NO sleep last night and because of the stress of being trapped in my own mind and because I hadn't eaten anything. \n\nMy aunt died in May. It started that night. I felt my heart do \"something\". I was gearing up to take on my personal white whale - a fucking chemistry class. After all the failing and fighting and insulting and sadness of my childhood, I was just so terrified of getting back into one of my problem classes. \n\nI flashed back to the anger and disappointment on my mother's face and the smug pout as she quipped about being someone's maid. Since that's all I could possibly do. Getting cleaning supplies for Christmas... ugh. We didn't KNOW about my learning disability. Why would we check? I was considered \"above average\". I didn't know WHY I couldn't live up to \"above average\".\n\nIt's been a little over two months since the descent started. I think I'm dying every day. I love to paint my nails (I am/was an avid laquerista) but I cut them off so I can better document how healthy they look. I am checking my lymph nodes and they ARE a little sore, but it MIGHT be because I'm fucking poking them all the time! I spend an unreasonable amount of time with my hand on my heart. I'm not super patriotic, I'm making sure it's beating right. I have to stop myself from running to the blood pressure cuff every time I'm near a pharmacy. Sometimes I want to check it more than once. Let's be perfectly honest, my heart could very well be having abnormal palpitations, but it's probably from the stress of worrying about it.\n\nI'm so so worried that I'm driving my fucking glorious husband insane. He says I'm not. I can't believe him. He says the stereotypical, \"You need to shrug it off/get over it.\" I can't EVEN be upset because there's a tiny person inside my brain that is SCREAMING at me to get over it! The me that people are used to; who fights so hard to take back control from... whatever this thing is. That said, I've already decided that if I am dying I'm going to leave him. We're still young. he can find a nice girl who will live a long life instead of taking care of my while I die. I really really wish I could stop thinking about that every day.\n\nI miss the days of pulling out my hair, intrusive thoughts, and repetitive stress dreams. I thought that was bad! I would trade all of my eyelashes and brows to beat this. I've had panic attacks before, but not multiple times a week. Not when I'm home alone and it SEEMS like I should be able to relax. I've never sat in a doctor's office and cried, \"Is it my heart!?\" No, it's the stress induced muscular tension. I feel totally encased in chaos. Fuck this pressure in my chest.\n\nI passed chemistry. Something I never thought I'd do. I thought I would be able to take control back from myself. I took care of some of the back pain, apparently it's going to be a process. I still feel utter despair. I'm going to ruin my life. I'm going to ruin my beautiful marriage. I HAVE to get this under control. I just don't know what to do. My god what's wrong with me!?\n\nI'm sorry that none of this makes sense. I sat down and I wrote it because I feel like I'm about to explode. Today I thought that maybe being dead was better than reverting my to my childhood. I can't say I'm suicidal. I mean, I wouldn't kill myself, but it seems like a fantasy. Just to be able to relax.",

I went to the mall yesterday with a friend, because she asked me to go \"job hunting\" with her.\n\nI've never had a part-time job before, and I'm young...but, she's had a job before. On Tuesday night I was making myself nauseous at the thought of approaching a staff member/manager to ask if they're hiring, and handing my resume in. I thought I'd end up getting rejected or everyone would say, \"Sorry...not hiring\"\n\nI thought my friend would take the lead since she's done this before, but actually, I was the one who approached  95% of the people to inquire. I put on a smile, and I just went for it (completely faking it...that isn't me *at all*)\n\nBut I ended up giving in my resume to 9 places, one place told me that I'd have to apply online, and when I got home I applied to two other places.\n\nI have a bad feeling about a couple of the places, because I know they probably won't do anything with my resume. But for most of the places, at least right now, I'm feeling like I have a slight chance.\n\nI'm worried about possibly getting an interview, because I don't think I can pull off that kind of fake confidence again, one-on-one, but I'm happy I did something out of my comfort zone.\n\nEdit: Grammar",

I never knew where to start, who to talk to and what to do about it, I just thought it was part of how I will be forever. \n\nMy boyfriend kept telling me to see the GP and they can provide support and refer me to someone but I always thought you only see them when you are sick or need a medical note and I worried they would dismiss me as feeling \"down\" and to stop wasting their time. Stupid I know but I am sure you can all appreciate the things your mind can come up with.\n\nIn the morning I felt empowered and determined and hanging up the phone I felt great. However as the day progressed and I knew at 6pm that day after work I will have to go see her and talk to her about this I started to get more and more anxious. \n\nGoing in there I felt stupid and worried but once I started and seeing her genuine concern and helpfulness I felt much better about it. She referred me to a psychologist and has me on a plan to get help. \n\nStill early days I know now I need to make step 2 in calling this psychologist but I am determined to do this and now I've reflected on what I accomplished yesterday I am feeling proud of myself.

Basically,I tend to get fixated on something to 'panic' about quietly, time goes by, I feel reassured or whatnot etcetc rinse, repeat on a small scale. This has happened since I can remember, the first episodes being when I was a small kid and feeling for a few months like I was surely going to die (something along the lines of hypochondria). My mom took me to the doctor, he said I was fine, I got over it. Onto the next thing.\n\nI fear this is going to sound stupid, but here it goes. I imagine you aren't judgmental people, I'll bank on it! Recently, I somehow stumbled on the 'conspiracy' reddits and everything there seemed 'true' to my panicking mind. I spent hours of my day self-debunking these and gathering reassurance etc. on the internet. This has gotten worse and while I don't worry about those more ridiculous things, I now worry endlessly about 'plausible' real-life doomsday scenarios and constantly feel like the sky is falling down, that I'm not going to live to see old age, that everything I do is pointless etcetc. because we are all doomed. Again, spending large swaths of my day trying to reassure myself, and instead just falling more and more into it.\n\nSo the obvious rationalization is that most things in the world are out of my control, and in such events, there is little I could ever do. I feel now like I won't ever feel normal again. I'm having nightmares, I'm taking OTC pills to help me sleep, I'm focusing on these things instead of spending time with my friends and husband, and I'm withdrawing from my hobbies (mainly gaming) while I'm spending time convincing myself I'm doomed.\n\nSo I'm looking for help. Is there anything I can do to stop myself from doing these things? Is there anything I can do to calm down my mind? Do I need to run off and get medicated (I really am opposed to this, but now I feel like I'm never to be able to resume a normal life). Basically, what are some first steps, and what should I be looking to do about my feelings?\n\nThanks for reading, it's my first ost as I said, and I hope people will share their thoughts.",
