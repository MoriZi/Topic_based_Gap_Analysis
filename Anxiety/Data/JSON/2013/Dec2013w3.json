            "selftext": "I really hate the physical symptoms of anxiety. I feel like I could handle the sadness, the stress, feeling wired out, being lonely, etc., but the physical symptoms are what really get me.\n\n\nFor me, those symptoms are centered around my throat and I feel like there's something caught in it, like I can't swallow or breathe, or my neck feels tense. My impulse when I feel like I can't breathe is to seek medical attention, but going to the ER isn't going to help anything. I'm just going to sit in a waiting room for a while, have my vitals taken, lay in a bed and talk to a nurse and a doctor for a couple of minutes, then be dismissed with a bill and possibly a small benzo prescription. I've had more panic attacks than I can count over the last three years and they've all ended the same way: I calm down. They vary in intensity and duration and sometimes the symptoms are slightly different, but they all end the same way. I've been checked out multiple times. I've had EKGs, thyroid tests, a couple of nasolaryngoscopies, and everything checks out normal. I could stand to lose a few pounds, but that's the extent of my medical issues.\n\n\nI know there is nothing wrong with me physically, but when I'm having a panic attack, all of my experience and knowledge don't seem to matter. All I know is that I feel like I can't breathe and I want to preserve my life. I wish I could convince my panicking self that I'll calm down and that I'll be fine, but I haven't been able to do so to date.\n\n\nI know all of the standard coping strategies. I need to start working out. I just haven't had the motivation. I can't keep waiting until I feel like it, though, because I never will. I need to force myself to get out and do something. I also need to start meditating again. It's been helpful in the past and it would probably be helpful now. I'm going to a yoga class tonight. I hope that is relaxing and helpful. I have plans to get myself out of the situation I'm in which is causing me so much stress and anxiety and loneliness, but there's a lot of waiting in the mean time that is being filled with anxiety and panic.\n\n\n/rant",

            "selftext": "Today was a good day for me. Not much anxiety, just a little heavy in the chest and shortness of breaths. Will tomorrow be okay? I have utterly no idea. It may be horrible and I may have a panic attack. But right now, I'm not worrying about anything. I'm feeling good.\n\nWe anxious people are a bunch of nice people. Why? Because we are so considerate. We take other people's feelings into serious account. We care, we are cautious, and even though we are scared of getting hurt, we also try not to hurt other people. Our problem is that we care too much. We are sentimental. We are fragile. But that's not a *bad* thing per se, we just need to tone it down. Imagine how it would be if we got rid of the negative parts of our personality and kept the positive ones; we would be the nicest people ever. We would be thoughtful and caring.\n\nI might spiral into an anxiety episode and completely forget about this tomorrow, but remember, it will get better. There is hope, even just a little bit. The fact that you are acknowledging your anxiety and reading about it on this subreddit is a big step to recovery. \n\nDon't ever think that no one understands. I do! Everyone here on /r/anxiety does. We are not a single anomaly, there is actually a bunch of us. Although you may think that no one around you understands, give credit to them for trying to understand. Sometimes we can't even explain what we are feeling. We can't expect everyone to understand us and yield our way. But just know that *some* of us do understand. You're not alone. \n\nFor practical advice, lately I learned from a TED talk that when I'm anxious, I should concentrate on my anxious feelings instead of thoughts that *make* me anxious. So instead of thinking, *I'm horrible. How do I expect my boyfriend to stay with me? He's definitely going to get tired of me in 3 months.* Try to think, *Okay. I'm feeling anxious. My heart is racing. I feel scared. But it's okay. It'll pass.* I find it helpful because it distracts me from my racing thoughts.\n\nI also have a theory. I believe that many of you would agree with me that we are not very confident people. We doubt ourselves constantly and think that we are not good enough and we are not good at anything. In a positive light, we are humble. But it also damages us. I think that volunteering can help boost our confidence, because we would be making ourselves useful without getting money in return. We would actually be helping someone. Although I normally don't like volunteering and I haven't had the time or energy to do so, I think we should all try. Sometime in the future. We just need to talk ourselves into doing it! \n\nIf this makes just one of you feel better, I've done something good. If anyone wants to PM me and talk, I'll be around. Lastly, I leave you with a quote from Andy Warhol,\n\n\"Sometimes people let the same problem make them miserable for years when they could just say, So what. That's one of my favorite things to say. So what.\"\n\nWe have anxiety. So what? That doesn't make us bad people. Smile!",

            "selftext": "So, after 5 years of panic attacks and depression...I went to my doctor about it.\n\nEveryone always says; 'Go see your GP.. it'll be fine, that's what they're there for. It'll help' etc..  But obviously it's easier said than done. SO MUCH easier said than done.\n\nBut today, I did it. \nI went.\n\nI drove to the doctors surgery with my mum. \nUsually in there, you have to wait almost an hour to be seen, but today the wait was less than a minute. \nI didn't think about what I was going to say before I said it.. I figured the words would just come to me. And they did. \nIt went a bit like this:\n\nMe: \"I've been suffering with panic attacks since I was about 16. I usually get them when I start a new job, or college, or have an interview, started driving on my own..Basically when I do new things that people would usually be nervous about..I get 100 x more nervous and my anxiety tips me over the edge. My heart beats heavily, my chest tightens, I can't talk, breathe properly and I can't stop myself from crying\".\n\nDoctor: \"You say you suffer from panic attacks, do you also suffer from depression?\"\n\nMe: \"Yes.. I think I do\"  ~[At this point I burst into tears..Apologising multiple times as the doctor assured me it was okay]\n\nDoctor: \"So do you think you're depressed because of anxiety, or anxious because you are depressed?\"\n\nMe: \"I think the anxiety sets off the depression.\"\n\nDoctor: \"And is it affecting your life, a lot?\"\n\nMe: \"Yes. Completely.\"  [Still in a mess of tears - Luckily the doctor gave me a tissue]\n\n-- The doctor brought up a questionnaire on his computer screen. Questions like 'How often, in a week, do you feel like you're a failure and life is not worth living?' and then options from 'Never', 'A few days' 'Several days' or 'Every day'.\n\nAfter completing it, he said he's going to put me on some medication. Half a 50mg tablet of Sertraline daily, after breakfast.\n\nI'm also now awaiting to hear from a therapist in the near future.\n\n\nI'm writing this because I know how it feels to feel worthless, hopeless, in a hole you can't get out of.\nI know that it's embarrassing and you feel weak.\nI know that every day is SO difficult and tiring to keep pretending that everything is okay.\n\nBut it doesn't have to be. \nDoctors ARE there to help. And you will never really get just how easy it is until you do it yourself. But it takes that massive weight, that you've got used to for so long, off your shoulders.\n\nI went in with my mum. But really, she didn't need to be there because it was just me and the doctor.\nSometimes its better to go alone, because I know that some people will hold back what they say, but you do need to be 100% honest. \n\nIf you're thinking about going to get help, or have any questions then please ask. I had a few questions that I wanted to know which I couldn't find online. But I will do my best to answer yours from my own experiences. Even if you just want to know how to word your issues to the doctor.\n\n\nThe outcome of my experience is that, luckily, I have a lovely boss at work (Which I've just started) you has said she'll work with me through this and when I'm able and ready to come back to work, they will support me fully.\n\nI've learned, through this, that the human race can sometimes be a hell of a lot better than you give it credit for.\n\n\nPlease get in touch if you need to. And if not, just remember that if I can do this, you CERTAINLY can. \n\n\nTL;DR - I went to the doctor after putting it off through fear. It was fine. If you have any questions or need advice please ask. Everything will be okay.    :) ",

            "selftext": "**Read Me First:**\n\nMy panic disorder seems to be fairly unique, and it could be argued it isn\u2019t exactly anxiety, so this may not be applicable to many people.  I\u2019m no doctor or shrink, nor am I a meditation instructor, and none of this is intended to diagnose, treat, or cure anything.  I just want to share a technique that has been of great help to me.\n\n**Background:**\n\nI have a panic disorder in which the symptoms are about 90% physical (chest pain, shortness of breath, lightheadedness, sometimes pain in the left arm, sometimes pain in my bowel, sometimes pain in my upper gut just behind/below the bottom of my ribcage, and pain in the back of my neck).  Only in my most severe attacks to I experience the (usually common in panic disorder) symptoms of fear or sense of impending doom.  This has sent me to the ER twice, and I\u2019ve discussed and treated it with multiple different doctors.  One primary care practitioner noted that a large percentage of my symptoms took place in body parts along the [vagus](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vagus_nerve) nerve, which runs from the bowel/base of the spine, winding through organs all through the torso, ending at the base of the skull in the back of the neck.  \n\nI brought all of this information to a clinical psychologist who happened to be very experienced with meditation.  This was the first time after 10 years of having the disorder that I tried using a therapist for treatment.\nI have a long history with meditation, and a powerful relationship with one specific practice (which isn\u2019t relevant to this discussion).  Because of my experience with meditation, and the nature of my symptoms, my therapist taught me the following technique and asked me to practice it at home daily, until I became able to practice it during an attack.\n\n**A note on meditation for beginners:**\n\nThis technique will require you to focus on a physical sensation and on some creative visualization.  If you try this as a beginner to meditation, you need to understand that you will not be able to maintain this focus constantly over any given practice session.  There is a reason people use the word \u201cpractice\u201d so frequently when referring to regular mediation.  As you focus on the object of your meditation, your attention will drift and random thoughts will come and go.  You will probably spend more time with your focus distracted than with your focus on the object of your meditation.  Don\u2019t allow yourself to get frustrated by this.  When you notice your attention on something other than the object of your meditation, just recognize that fact and gently push your attention back to the object of mediation.  Let go of any frustration you feel during this process.  If you feel increasing frustration the longer your session goes, then start with shorter sessions (5 or 10 min) and work your way up until it is easier to let go of frustration.  It is more important to be calm during meditation than it is to hone your focus.  Increased focus on your object of mediation will come with time and practice.\n\n**The Tools for this Technique:**\n\n*Focus on physical sensation:*  You can focus on any body part to increase your awareness of it.  I will use the [perineum](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perineum)(taint and surrounding area) as the example here, because that\u2019s where this technique starts.  Sitting comfortably and with your eyes closed, you will focus all your attention on the physical sensation of the perineum (how it feels to be part of your body, where it is, all the physical sensations you get from paying attention to it).  You will do this for several parts of your body for this technique.\n\n*Creative visualization:*  I\u2019m not going to ask you to believe in anything that isn\u2019t real here, but it may seem like it for a couple of parts.  I will ask you to focus your attention on something you are imagining for some parts of this, to combine the act of physical sensation with your imagination as an object of the meditation.\n\n**The Technique:**\n\nThis will need to be practiced regularly when you are feeling fine.  You can\u2019t expect any positive results if you only try this during an attack when it is most difficult to influence where your attention goes.  Once you have practiced enough, then you should be able to do this during a panic attack.\n\nSit comfortably with your back straight and chin slightly tucked.  It doesn\u2019t matter if you are cross-legged on the floor, slightly reclined with your feet down, or whatever (though barefoot in a chair outside with my feet in the grass is particularly good for me).\n\nStart by focusing your attention on your perineum, the base of your torso.  Spend a few moments here until you really have a solid connection of your attention to this part of your body.  Now imagine a point about 12 ft (3.7 meters) below you.  This point is like the roots of a tree, coming straight down from your body and spreading into the earth like a root system.  Visualize it taking positive energy from the earth and bringing it back into you at your base.  However you choose to visualize this, it should make you feel comfortable and secure.  You are grounded, connected to the earth below you and drawing positive energy from it.  (Remember this is a visualization tool.  I\u2019m not asking you to believe in a life force, earth energy, auras or anything like that.)\n\nFrom there, as you are focusing on positive energy flowing from a point 12 feet below you into your base, begin to move your awareness upward, keeping this positive flow in mind.  Move your attention up to the space between your belly button and your spine.  As you focus on the physical sensation of your body here, and visualize the positive energy flowing up, make sure to go slow and deliberately FEEL all physical parts of your body where you are visualizing a flow of energy. \nContinue moving your attention up your torso, the space between your lower ribs and spine, the area around your heart, your neck, your throat, the base of your skull, your sinuses, pineal gland, to the top of your head.  (If you are familiar with the idea of chakras, these are a really useful visualization tool here, feeling these \u201cenergy centers\u201d connected by the energy you are flowing through your body)  \nWhen you get to the top of your head, then visualize a point about 12 feet directly above you.  From here you will visualize drawing in a different kind of energy (preferably something you would connect to the divine).  This point expands into the space above you like a tree sending out branches with leaves to collect the sunlight.  You draw in this positive energy from above you, and bring it back in through the top of your head.  \n\nNow bring the flow from the point above you back down through the top of your head, through your pineal gland, sinuses, throat, neck, clavicle, back down to the area around your heart.\n\nYou are now very aware of the physical sensations of your body parts in a column from your perineum straight up through the top of your head, and visualizing comforting, grounding energy from the earth flowing up into your heart meeting with the divine energy flowing down from above and mixing and flowing in the area between your chest and spine.\n\nContinue focusing on this until your timer is up or until you feel like stopping.  I have done this for as little as 5 minutes or as long as an hour.  Slowly open your eyes and take a moment to come out of the meditation as if you were coming out of a nap.\n\nI\u2019ve done this for as little as 5 minutes or as long as an hour at a time, but usually used 20 minute sessions practicing every day before I was able to use this during a panic attack and actually end the attack with this technique.\n\n**Results:**\n\nFor me, after a period of practice, this became a very powerful tool for me to manage my panic attacks.  It usually stops them just as effectively as Xanax, in shorter time and with none of those \u201cXanaxed out\u201d side effects.  I have noticed that if I stop practicing when I feel fine, after a time it becomes less effective when I try it during an attack.  It only works as long as I stay in practice.\n\nSince learning this well, I have used this technique as a passenger in a car, and a few times even with my eyes open in a meeting room full of people, none of them being the wiser that I was fighting off a panic attack.\n\n**Finishing Up:**\n\nIf anyone actually spends a reasonable amount of time learning this, I\u2019d love to hear how it works for you.\n\nAny questions or comments?\n",

            "selftext": "I just don't even know where to start. I started therapy at the end of the summer this year. My therapist is awesome, she's really understanding, and she's helped. When I did her evaluation for anxiety and depression levels, I scored VERY low on depression and EXTREMELY high on anxiety. She said she's never had a patient score this high. But she says I never learned self-soothing tactics as a child, but never really gave me advice on HOW to learn self-soothing. I can't afford therapy anymore, and the sessions my work was paying for have run out. \n\nI'm tired of having panic attacks. Ever since I was diagnosed with anxiety, I have been hyper-aware of it. It's like any time I get even mildly upset, I can feel the anxiety welling up in my chest, and then it's just panic from there on out. Like tonight at work(I work in a photo lab) I was super busy. I had about 7 orders going and was trying to keep them all organized. A customer approached and told me her last name. Her envelope was sitting there on the counter, but no photos were inside. After searching through all the photos I had printed, I came to the realization that while I pushed the button for her photos to print, they never actually printed.\n\nThe lady there was picking them up for her daughter, so she got her daughter on the phone. They wanted to know why I hadn't called them and told them it hadn't printed. I tried to explain that I'd done over 250 orders in the last three hours and had just barely realized they didn't print. The customer bitched and bitched until I gave her 20% off the order. Things finally slowed down, so I jumped at my chance to take a smoke break. Go outside. Smoke. Breathe. \n\nWhen I came back into the store, I saw my photo lab was flooded. I had left the water on to fill one of my tanks and forgot to shut it off before going outside. This sent me into full-on panic mode. I grabbed a mop and started sopping up the water. My face was beet-red, I couldn't breathe, I was sobbing... All over a mildly flooded photo lab. Nothing was even damaged. But I panicked anyways. I felt so fucking humiliated standing there and crying while mopping in front of all my coworkers. And none of them even understood that I am NOT sad. I am fucking happy as a clam, I'm just anxious and when I get upset(mad or just generally anything other than happy) I cry. I just do. \n\nBut every time I feel the anxiety coming up, I panic because I don't know how to deal with the anxiety. I panic, which makes me more anxious, which makes me panic, which makes me anxious. It's a vicious fucking cycle. I almost wish I had never gone to therapy because I hate life so fucking much since I was told it's not depression, it's anxiety. This shit didn't interfere so severely with my life until I got diagnosed(or maybe I didn't realize how it was interfering?). \n\nI'm so fucking miserable. I need to learn to calm myself down and only one of my managers at work seems to understand and give me the time I need to cool off when I get anxious. What can I do to calm down in the moment when I can't just go do whatever the fuck I want to? How do I make myself breathe? How do I stop the humiliation that makes the anxiety worse when others see me cry? How do I just keep this under control? I realize I will never feel normal, but I need to control this. ",

I haven't worked a single day since then and not being around people is really taking it's toll.\n\nToday, after years and years of nothing.. a really good friend of mine finally said everything I've always wanted to hear. I thought maybe some would like to read too..\n\n\"Go out and do something. Not partying it up on the weekends... or weekdays. I mean volunteer for something, get a job, do some lawn maintenance, offer to walk the neighbours dog, look into school... anything!\n\nThe more you sit idle the less happy you'll be. That includes drawing, computer time, and video games. Human interaction is important whether you're an introvert or not. The more time you spend alone and left to your own devices the worse it'll get. You are miserable because you spend most of your time alone, thinking about how you're alone, even though you don't HAVE to be alone.\n\nHonestly, I recommend getting a job. Even if it's something simple and doesn't require a degree. Not because you're \"a jobless bum\" but because it gets you out of the house, forces you to interact with people, and it keeps your mind occupied and away from the dark corners that are simply dark corners and nothing else.\n\nHere's the thing. People, your family and friends, they WANT to help you, but it's awfully hard when the person your trying to help won't do much to improve their situation themselves. Bad attitudes and feelings are contagious. It's difficult to hang out with someone who feels so poorly about themselves and not start feeling it as well, especially if you, like pretty much everyone in the world, are already dealing with your own demons.\n\nI know you. I know you're not useless or undeserving, but I also know you need a good push. Your friends love you. It's just hard to say what some people need to hear sometimes.\"",

            "selftext": "I am not a doctor and any advice given is strictly opinion.\n\nTo start, some back story. I had my first panic attack in December 2008 at the time I didn't know anything about Benzos and was all for a prescription for Xanax. My doctor obliged. I lost my insurance and now am at the mercy of government programs until my SSD and Medicade kick in. These programs do not like giving out Benzos which I am fine with because I am looking to wean off them anyway. That being said anyone thats been prescribed them knows cutting them cold turkey after 5 years is not only unpleasant but highly dangerous. I was 22 during my first panic attack and the condition has only worsened. I have since developed Agoraphobia, Major Depression Disorder, Borderline Personality, redeveloped OCD, and what doctors tell me are the beginnings of manic episodes that could be anything from a new symptom of my depression to schizophrenia but only time will tell. \n\nI start my journey at a program called Crest in New Jersey. They have me fill out paper work and then give me a survey. I am 100 percent honest about everything including my past Opiate addiction and suicide ideation (The latter is something I still struggle with.). They give me a meeting with a \"perscirber\" which I believe is a nurse practitioner within 4 days I am fresh out of Xanax until then. \n\nI tried to make it benzo free but check myself into the ER within 16 hours. The Doctor on duty luckily is a believer in Benzo Withdrawal and gives me an Ativan ASAP. I am taken to their psych ward where when asked what I was there for I answered truthfully. A 4 day script of Xanax to hold me over before my appointment. He informs me they \"don't do that here.\" and tells me I can go on my way, they'll bill me later. A nurse in the unit that has watched me break down takes pity on me and calls the upstairs doctor who writes a script for 6 .25 Xanax well lower than my 1 mg 3 times a day dosage I am used to, but I'll make it through the night.\n\nThe next day I am forced to obtain Xanax from a friends dad. I show up to Crest 3 days later not a complete wreck they ask how I am not in withdrawal, I tell them the truth about the friends dad and they say they can't co-sign those actions but understand and allow me to see the perscriber. Before I see her they tell me 99.9 percent of the people that are given meds in this program don't get benzo's. I say I understand and am ushered in.\n\nThe perscriber gives me another interview I tell her about my anxiety, history with mental illness, and general bleak world view she is sympathetic. I tell her my current meds and she says \"That is way too many benzos.\" I agree and ask her to help me taper off benzos completely. She says okay and gives me the plan. I am well versed on my medication, she says she wants to give me a longer acting benzo so I don't keep having spikes and rebound anxiety. I suggest Klonopin she says I read her mind. She prescribes me 1 .5 mg of Klonopin a day for 10 days. I am not amused...but I have some left over Xanax and she says I can take 2 if the day is really rough. I ask her if she thinks the drop in dosage is safe. She assures me it is and the fact it is longer acting will do wonders in my taper and gives me another appointment for that Friday (6 days away). Flash forward to Tuesday and the plan has failed! I have taken all my Xanax and K-Pins sans one .5 K-Pin (Mind you I am still taking less than half the amount of benzos I was taking merely 4 days before hand.) My withdrawal is at critical mass and I am in a constant state of panic. Im clammy, sweaty, I think my hearts going too fast, having episodes of numbness in my extremities, I can only sleep 3 hours at a time if I am lucky, and rent is due.\n\nI tell my roommate I am going to get my last check from Dominos. I had been working their for about 4 weeks it was the first real job I have had post my first panic attack 5 years before, and I was starting to fall into a series of panic attacks and self isolation that caused me to call them and tell them I lost my license and can no longer work their. I enjoyed the people and was sad about it, but I just couldn't pull it off any longer. None of this is helping my depression.\n\nI wake up the next morning all ready a little panicked. I live in Brick and worked in Red Bank which is about 40 minutes away. I didn't mind because driving is one of my few non stressors and the area was full of rich folks that tipped hardily. But now I am on a tenth of my prescribed dosage (The .5 K-Pin I had saved for the drive.)  of a medicine I have been suddenly deprived of and I have to drive my car 40 minutes through a gauntlet of automobiles. The drive is terrible as one could predict and I spend most of it trying not to lose myself in my thoughts and panic. I have several ideations of just careening into on coming traffic and putting myself out of my misery but they are luckily just ideations and I manage to make it to my job. I get my check and notice the hospital across the street, as I shake and sweat I realize what needs to be done.\n\nAs I walked into the hospital emergency room I felt a sudden relief I knew I would not be allowed to drop dead in this place (at least not without a fight.) I walk up to the reception and tell them I am here because I was taken off my medicine and am now in a major panic attack. I am seen almost instantly as mental crisis cases take preference in this particular hospital. The nurse sees  I am taken to the back, put in a robe that is not made for 6'7\" 350 pound man. Greeted by an unsympathetic Russian nurse that probably has every right in the world to scoff at my first world disorder, but I really wish she wouldn't. They take blood, an EKG, and a chest X-ray. I am interviewed by a crisis manager. \"I have OCD, BPD, Depression, yadda yadda yadda.\" She asks if I would like to be admitted to the crisis unit for stabilization. I ask if she thinks it's a good idea. She says yes. So I agree. \n\nI was worried about being admitted to their crisis unit because *MORE BACK STORY ALERT!* I had been in a similar unit about 3 months before in San Francisco I had moved to LA to do Stand Up Comedy (another odd non stressor.) and ran out of money. Despondent I went to girlfriends house who lived in Oakdale a small farming town about an hour from San Francisco. I had planned to go there to essentially have sex one more time before I killed myself. So I went over there had sex, hung out, we talked about life and love and all that shit and I was at peace with myself. I told her I was going to San Francisco to find work and I would be back soon. She wished me well and I b lined it to the Golden Gate Bridge. A police officer walked up to me as I stared at the beautiful structure he asked me if I was alright. I said yes. He asked again. I said no. The officer then escorted me to San Francisco General Hospital where I was 5150'd. The people were nice enough but the lack of funding meant I NEVER TALKED TO A SINGLE DOCTOR DESPITE BEING THERE FOR 10 DAYS! Also I was the only person that really really insane. With no one to talk to but nurses and people that were nearly non functioning due to their illness, most of who stayed in their room aside from a nice man that was once a rich business man but had digressed into a child like mental state and a man that could be described as future me I soon went stir crazy. I called my mother (something I was highly against.) she called me a faker in nice terms sent me 1500 dollars and I proceeded to drive cross country back to NJ. All in all it sucked and I learned nothing of my illness.\n\nSo yea I was afraid this place was like that place, and it was not. I was wheeled down to the unit they took all my strings off my clothes (because I can't stab myself with one of the many pencils in my room.) at this point I was introduced to my roommate a man who claimed he was there for benzo withdrawal which he was. He then said the doctors here didn't give benzos at all. And I was then asked if I wanted to go to a group. I did but during all this riff raff of medical tests and what not I forgot I was having a panic attack. Which escalated. I left the group in a cold sweat the nurse tried to calm me down. I was given an Ativan I calmed down and went to sleep.\n\nThe next morning I was antsy but the nurse assured me it would get better today. I was given 2 .5 mg of klonopin a day and learned all the people there complaining about not getting benzos where people that were abusing them and I was fine. I didn't get to see a doctor that day but it went off pretty good. I was introduced to the social people that where in there. Some where comical, others sad, most were actually kicking heroin or another drug. I was forced to attend groups (not really but not going wasn't helping my case and frankly I hadn't talked to people for so long on a regular basis I welcomed it.) much like the people some of the groups were comical, others sad, and most were based on kicking heroin. My first day went well.\n\nThe next day I met my doctor and social worker. I was still not sure about the no benzo policy and at the time knew I was only getting my K-Pins because I brought my prescription bottle in with me. So I sit down the doctor asks how I feel. I say disinterested in life and constantly anxious. She asks me what I take for depression. I say nothing SSRI's have had bad side effects (more suicidal ideation.) in the past. She was shocked and immediately prescribed me Zoloft and the High BP medicine I wasn't taking due to finances. Then she got to my anxiety I told her about my attacks and medicines. She asked what I was on before. I told her about the Xanax 3 times a day 1 MG. She was pretty upset the persricber at Crest cut my dosage to what she did. I told her I really wanted to get off benzos but I wanted to taper off just like I told the people at crest. She said she was for that as well and re upped my K-Pins 2 2 1 MG pills a day to stabilize me. It worked. \n\nOver the next few days my meds were tinkered with mostly the Zoloft was increased and I asked the social worker what I should do about not working. She got me in contact with ICMS which is a case management program who are trying to get me on SSD and Medicade so I can go back to school. I was pleased but still having panic attacks. I made face to face friends for the first time in a long long long while and was finding myself attached to this crisis unit. I had massive panic attacks every time I realized I would be leaving. My doctor said it was normal and they were always there if I needed them. I felt reassured for the first time in a long time. I was mostly panic free aside from a few flairs (less than 30 minutes) over the next week. Until my mom visited. The day before that I had a massive panic attack as she does not believe I am ill. To her credit she tried and the meeting was pretty good.\n\nThe days past the down side was this group of adults being treated very child like but that was the idea. Nothing was stressful everything was done for you. You were constantly reassured and were encouraged to talk to the other patients about whatever. Group therapy was amazing. I was happy. \n\nLife felt balanced, but it was time for it to end. I was discharged last Wednesday after spending 7 days in the unit. I got the number of some great people I hope to keep in contact with. And was given a new prescription and outpatient psychiatrist also I am on a official and safe K-Pin taper and no longer in constant panic though it still comes and goes.\n\nThe second I stepped out of the hospital and into my car reality hit me and I spent the whole drive home having a panic attack, granted it was much less extreme than the one I had driving up there. I've went back to isolating since I've been released and am now working through the system and it's bureaucracy. My first shrink appointment is Wednesday. Tonight I went to dinner with my mother. I had constant panic attacks due to my agoraphobia. She was annoyed but realizes I am no longer faking it...after 27 years. She asks the questions most of you guys probably get asked by the people that try to understand your anxiety or depression but can't fully grasp it. \"Why don't you just roll with it?\" \"What is the reason you are so sad?\" \"Why do you think those hand movements help your panic attacks?\" \"Is there anything I can do?\" and there isn't really. It's going to be an uphill battle for life I suppose but I'll take it and the first spark was allowing myself to be helped by the crisis unit. I now know though pretty extreme my condition is manageable. And hope to continue to progress. I plan to take a walk in the park tomorrow and I think I am looking forward to it.\n\nIn conclusion my crisis center did miricales for me. But after my trip to the SF crisis unit I know these vary from hospital to hospital. Also there are some downsides like These places are filled with some iffy characters and uncomfortable things and after leaving there is an assimilation process back into the regular world, but if it is in a moderately well funded area and you really want to stabilize yourself and have the symptoms I have or any other mental illness including addiction you might want to check the option out. \n\nThank you for reading, sorry if their is spelling and grammatical errors.",
