Basically helped me realize that the issues that I thought were causing most of my anxiety were just insignificant things and I was letting them cause me so much stress because I've been so worried about family things but haven't really told anyone about them. I got really worked up and ending up getting really close to having a panic attack. \n\nHe was getting frustrated which I can understand, he's never had it or dealt with it, it's new to him. But when I started to panic he just held me really tight, which I dunno, helps to squeeze out my anxiety, if that makes sense. \n\nWe talked about ways I can get help, and help myself. He encouraged me to start exercising again, start eating properly, etc. he never said anything like \"get over it\" \"learn to deal with it\" etc. \n\nAnyways. After all this I was exhausted so we were laying down to go to sleep and I said \"Thank you for putting up with my ranting and crying\" and just calm as ever he says \"I don't mind, I just want to help you get better\" I've never felt so, I don't even know the word I'm looking for. Thankful, happy, loved. \n\nI know it's a tough journey. But I feel like with someone like him it will make it just a little easier. \n\nAnd that's my story. Just felt like sharing. ",

After a while, my body gets calmed, I can think more clearly and my mind slows down.\n\n2. Talking about my anxiety with someone I trust. I just vent, and I ask that person to just listen. It helps understand me a little bit better. I realized that by trying to explain my symptoms out loud, they end up seeming illogical to my mind and the anxiety levels go down.\n\n3. Remember that anxiety is the \"fight or flight\" natural response of the body? Well, I go out and run fast, in an angry way. It helps a lot to discharge tue anxiety, by making my mind and my body tired. It can end up being a little bit addictive. The feeling is awesome after I finish and it is healthy.\n\n4. Green tea. Several cups of it when I'm at the office. It can calm me down and it has a weird effect in my mind that allows me to concentrate much better.\n\n5. Avoid cigarettes and caffeine. Cigarettes are the worst in all senses. I stopped smoking when I realized they affected my anxiety considerably. Coffee is only helpful when I am not having anxiety attacks, otherwise, it makes the symptoms much worse.\n\n6. If you have the money, go to a psychiatrist and get medication. I am under sertraline, and it started doing wonders after the first 3 weeks of usage. It was prescribed for me for 6 months. My anxiety attacks have almost completely dissapeared.\n\n7. Force yourself to understand that you want to feel better and you are going to do all you can to get better. Don't give up. Consider yourself lucky: you were born in a time when methods and medication exist to treat mental problems.\n\nYou are not alone. You are understood by a lot of people and we are all together in this. We must help each other.",

            "selftext": "I don\u2019t expect anyone to read this. I honestly don\u2019t care if people do. This is just a confession to myself I\u2019d like to share with the world.\n\nI\u2019m a 23 year old male and on December 1, 2013 I had my first serious panic attack. It was so severe I ended up in the ER. I thought I was dying. They treated me with some form of anti-psychotic (not sure which) and it only hid the emotions, and allowed them to taper off. But, they also numbed me. During that time, I wanted to feel something but couldn\u2019t, it was just blank. And, any attempted to feel anything was blocked out (I tried to force myself to feel something), and this was almost as scary as before the panic attack. \n\n\tTo give some background information. I\u2019m a recent college graduate, as well as a newly commissioned officer in a branch of the military. I have always been a pretty social person particularly at parties and social events, but suffer from social anxiety in big crowds in a professional setting, and just a general awkwardness in small talk situations. I have always been a typically adventurous person up until last year. \nOver the past year, I have changed a lot as a person. I have gone from a determined, hard, working hard partying college student, to a nervous young man, afraid of what the future will hold as well as a fear of how the past: my mistakes, my missed opportunities, my selfishness, has affected my development and will continue to affect my development. I\u2019m currently going through my quarter life crisis, I have thoughts about my deaths once a day in the form of a minor (2-10 second) panic attack. These have become less severe as of lately as I\u2019ve begun focusing on the fact that I will die, and what will I contribute to the world before I die.\n\nThere were many catalysts to my panic attack. \n\n1.\tAll the previously mention anxieties. \n2.\tThanksgiving is an awkward time in that I have never been particularly close to my family and I never feel like I fit in (except with my 3 sisters). \n3.\tMy dad and mother are currently in a custody battle with my sister (she\u2019s 17) and it is extremely bitter. In fact, that day I had to bring my sister to meet with my dad (first time she has seen him in two month), and it ended with me having to try to be the voice of reason to them both.\n4.\tI was drunk and hunger over from a three day binge. I was pretending I could still drink like I did during high school and college\n5.\tI was going to a party at a high school friend\u2019s house, and my girlfriend, as well as the girl I had loved in high school would be at. My girlfriend was aware she would be there and although she won\u2019t admit it, gets jealous over girls I had once liked. During this party, my girlfriend got trashed (too many card games, awkward situation from her, I have never seen her this drunk) and was throwing up during the bathroom. During this time, the old love began talking to me kind of flirtly (tough to tell, she\u2019s really awkward) and I was trying to keep an eye on the bathroom (making sure my gf was ok)\n6.\tMy girlfriend and I were both getting sick\n\nAs this night went on I began feeling uneasy. Like everything was spinning. I wasn\u2019t even drunk (only 3-4 beers, over a couple hours) and I couldn\u2019t control it. Then I began panicking, knocking on the door to the bathroom to make sure my gf was alright. She\u2019d always respond yes and told me not to worry, but I couldn\u2019t help it. I tried talking to people for a while, but that just made it worse. I ended up going to another room, pacing back and forth trying to breathe to calm down. When that failed, I went outside for fresh air, where I then threw up. Finally, I was able to gather myself to get my girlfriend and go back to my nana\u2019s, where I was staying.\n\tAt my nana\u2019s, I was still really shakey. I got my girlfriend in bed, and got in myself, but I couldn\u2019t relax. My heart began hurting, my headed pounded, air became like fire and I couldn\u2019t inhale. After about a half hour, I called my mom, and she came and got me and my girlfriend and we went to the emergency room. And that brings us back to the beginning.\n\n\tCurrently, I have not recovered fully. I\u2019m getting headaches once or twice a day, as well as the aura indicative of migraines. My throat closes around bed time (it relaxes with deep breathing) and my heart will occasionally feel weak. I have not been up to sleep without sleeping pills since. The worst is I have become a hypochondriac and keep searching online for what\u2019s killing me. \n\tFor right now, I\u2019m trying to get back into the routines of the day, but have yet to begin exercising again (I think I\u2019m still at least a little sick). I\u2019m trying to deep breath more to center myself and I\u2019m going try meditation tomorrow (I\u2019ve always been an on and off meditator).\n\n\tI know I will recover from this, I know time is needed, but I hate feeling so fragile. I have never felt this weak in my life. Writing this now helps me understand what I\u2019ve experienced, and gives me an idea of what I need to do. I just realized that since it, I have been unable to be near my girlfriend. She is a worry wart and her constant need of contacting me is running me thin. I want to tell her I need some space, but it\u2019s difficult. I just hope I don\u2019t get angry at her (I already yelled her once and this is the first time I ever had in 9 months). I hope she understands. But, I will get through this, with her, with me. I just needed to get off my chest.\n\t\nIt felt really good to write this.\n",

Good workers don't always fit an algorithmic mold.\"\n\nThis guy that replied to me just made me so mad. Here's what he had to say:\n\n&gt;I feel like the molds could come from the bottom-up, as well as the top-bottom. At places where there isn't a mold, the confident and happy employees might complain about not \"feeling connected \" because of lack of a mold and the managers could respond by weeding out all the overtly anxious and 'depressed' people.\n\nI was speechless. Weed out all the anxious and depressed people? When I asked him for clarification, I got this reply:\n\n&gt;My point was, would you regularly socialize with or have sex with a mentally ill person, if you could avoid it?\n\nWhat the hell is wrong with some people?",
