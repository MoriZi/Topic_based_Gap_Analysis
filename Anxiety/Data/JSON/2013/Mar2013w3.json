This is only my personal experience and how I decreased my anxiety level considerably. My anxiety was taking over my life for a while there, and I had frequent panic attacks. I changed a few key things in my life and now I feel completely normal; back to how my life was before anxiety. \n\nWhat I changed:\n1. Started taking multi-vitamins, inositol, and theanine. \n2. Exercising every day; mostly lifting weights.\n3. Changed my diet. This means more fruits/ vegetables/ whole grains. Also, I drink green tea and chamomile tea. \n4. Started meditating. I am not very progressive, so this was weird for me at first. But deep breathing exercises and mediation which focuses on pushing away negative thoughts really helped me calm down if I was about to have a panic attack. \n\nI hope this helps some people consider some alternatives when trying to control their own anxiety. Obviously do not do any of these things without doing research, and maybe talking to a doctor. \nCheers.",

I am a B student but since certifying in to my major I've had trouble with a particular broadcast writing class. We have about 22 or so writing assignments and the class is strict on spelling proper nouns, names and addresses and one mistake in this regard results in an F. Apparently its normal to fail a few and I failed a couple early on and had some really bad anxiety for it. I did better for couple weeks but today I received another F. \n\nI know that if I try hard i can pass this class but there's always the chance that I don't and I'm very frightened of that. I could withdraw at the end of the semester if it comes to that but I pray it doesn't. I just really worry that anxiety is going to make me react like this to an adversity or bad news in my life. Im worried about failing this class in being behind, and Im worried that I'll have anxiety attacks like the last time I failed. Does anyone experience this type of anxiety as well? Any suggestions?

Every test under the sun has been conducted, and nothing is physically wrong with me.  \n\nI have always suffered with mild-moderate general anxiety.  It definitely runs in my family - mom suffers, aunts suffer, cousins, etc.  My mother has taken an anti-depressant for as long as I remember and she always called it her \"stomach pill.\"  \n\nAfter the most recent round of stomach tests all came back negative, my doctor asked if I have anxiety.  I said yes, but I think I \"manage\" it pretty well...it doesn't really hinder my life in any major way; it's more of an annoyance that I deal with.  She recommended an anti-depressant for anxiety, as she said I have a very \"nervous\" sounding stomach, and she has seen GREAT success with Celexa for treating anxiety-related stomach issues.\n\nMy fiance is 100% completely, totally against me taking it.  He is CONVINCED (based on his own previous experience with anti-depressants...he has very severe anxiety) that this pill will completely change my entire personality and who I am as a human being.  Nothing I was saying was getting through to him.  I explained that my mom has taken an anti-depressant for the past 30 years FOR HER STOMACH.  She even called it her \"stomach pill\" and says it completely changed her life.  I tried to tell him to think of the Celexa as a pill to treat my stomach pain.  \n\nNothing worked.\n\nSo now I'm trying to dig and find articles and research supporting the use of anti-depressants (Celexa specifically) for the treatment of anxiety-related stomach pain.  I'm hoping this will help him understand.  Do any of you know of any good resources?\n\nI really want to try this, but he is vehemently against it.  It's almost making me want to take it and not tell him...I'm worried that if I tell him I'm going to try it, he is going to be hypersensitive and try to look for how I have \"changed.\"  Goddamnit this is ridiculous.  I don't want to be sneaky, I just want his support!!  Especially if this will make me feel better.",

            "selftext": "So I got big points for a standupshot (btw /r/standupshots) but I feel I should explain how I've gotten where I am. I have bad anxiety, spent time on and off of meds, and have battled with alcohol and drugs. These days I still wake up with a pounding heart, still find myself afraid to leave my house some days, and am in no way \"fixed\" or \"better\". What I do is tell my anxiety to **fuck off.** \n\nI know this is not easy. It has never been for me either, but here is my process.\n\nI wake up, and go for a bike ride. I work nights, so this is an option for me but the idea is the same: BE ACTIVE.\n\nI head to work, and every time I feel anxious I make myself drink water. This is a bit of a mental trick. Again, as far as I know this applies only to me, but by attaching a positive reaction to a negative thought I find it helps to disarm the thought.\n\nWhen done with work, I give myself \"me time\". This consists of literally anything that relaxes me. A big part of not being anxious (again, for me) is being a little selfish. Take a bath. Watch cartoons. Jerk it. Whatever you do, do not get down on yourself. Self loathing and anxiety are two sides of the same coin.\n\nOnce I was able to give myself a break, and love myself a little, I decided to do anything I could that would challenge my anxiety. I had history in comedy and theater, and found standup to be what I like to call \"free therapy\". I started telling crowds of strangers **everything.**\n\nI realize that what we can feel can seem insurmountable, but it is not. There are not enough success/positive posts in this sub. I am happy that there is a place to rant and have attacks, but I urge anyone else here with a success story to come forward and talk about how you got where you are.\n\nWe will always suffer from our affliction, but in the end I believe we can take more from it than it can take from us.\n\nMuch love, my fellow heartbeaters.",

I am, however, less stoked about driving 3 hours through a mostly rural area. It's not so much that I am scared of driving itself, but that I am scared of being in the middle of nowhere. My main fear is that I will get anxious and have a heart attack or something where no hospitals are around and where no one can get to me in time. I know this is highly irrational especially since I will have friends with me but I can't shake it at all. Does anyone else feel this way and of so how do you deal with it? I'm tired of being afraid to go places more than 30 minutes away from my house and without my friends it would be impossible.",

            "selftext": "I hope this is the right place to post. Ever since High School, I've had anxiety. Usually that of the social type. Never could really make friends and was afraid to talk to people.\n\nI'm now almost 30 and it's spread to all aspects of my life. I avoid social situations. Any relationships I have me and my gf just fight. I always worry she could be cheating on me, that I'm doing something wrong, that she doesn't care for me as much. So it results in constant fights. Even after telling the person of my extreme anxiety, it start off with them understanding, but then annoys them to the point of constant fights and break ups.\n\nI also am anxious about things that happened yesterday (in general, not about relationships all the time or anything, that's just one aspect). I'm constantly worrying about something I did yesterday. I'm constantly thinking the worst of what will happen today. And tomorrow? Forget about it, it's like the world will end. \n\nIt has gotten so bad that once I tried to kill myself with the same medicine that is suppose to be saving me. I ended up taking a bunch of xanax, sleeping pills and shots. I woke up the next day not remembering much, but my dad (who I guess I was texting) did and drove me to the hospital, where I was admitted for a week in the psycward (really strange because I feel normal, just sick of my life because of this anxiety). Of course it comes with a nice side of depression. \n\nSome days (most) I don't want to even get out of bed to go to work. It's affecting my work, my life, my relationships. Everything! I've tried therapy for years, many different meds, and now all I have is Xanax which helps at least prevent panic attacks (but my lovely doctor wants me off them cause it's not \"long term\" but doesn't have me on anything else, so I'm starting to get worse again and he don't seem to care).\n\nAny tips on what I can do? I am ready to explode, I can't have a normal life, I lost all my confidence and feel ugly and fat. I rarely can even leave the house anymore because I get too worked up. I dont' know what to do anymore.\n\nSorry if this is the wrong subreddit, if so can someone point me in the right direction? I just want the cycle to stop. The most advice I get is \"just man up and stop\". People just dont' understand and think it's that easy. I'm at wits end. It's almost unbareable. Sometimes I have to take 2-3 xanax at once to dull the worry. (Doctor said that would be ok). I want to be better. I hate my life because of it. No one understands. They all think \"Oh I have that too and I just had to solve it myself and you can too!\" But they don't understand. I worry from morning to night, cry for hours sometimes and just want it to end so I can be happy.\n\nThings I've tried:\nReading books on how to stop worry. Listening to stop worrying tapes and lectures, meds, therapy (had to stop, new insurance has a 30 co pay and that, on top of dr visits, just isnt affordable to me), hypnosis, the whole mirror thing (both positive and negative attempts to convince myself), motivational post-its, and so on. \n\nPlease, any information would help. I just want it to go away and improve. I've been dealing with this for a good 18 years and nothing seems to help.  ",

For example, I was looking at a gorgeous sunset and all of a sudden I started thinking about how fragile life is, how it goes by quickly and I started feeling really depressed and anxious, sort of like an existential crisis feeling. Another example was I was taking a hike and the smell of the grass and trees in the air reminded me of when I was young and would play outside.
