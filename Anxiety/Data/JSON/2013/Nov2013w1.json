            "selftext": "I have a long history of anxiety attacks with the usual symptoms: difficulty breathing, general \"freaking out\" (crying etc.), racing heart, incredible feelings of urgency and panic, and what I like to call \"electric skin\" where I feel almost itchy all over and if someone tries to touch me it nearly feels like a shock and I immediately recoil.\n\nHowever with therapy and medication it's gotten much better and these sorts of attacks are very rare for me now. But my anxiety isn't completely gone, of course. I still have moments of anxiety but instead I seem to shut down completely. I get very quiet and still and although my thoughts are racing, their process seems to have changed. For example instead of \"if I do the thing then the whole world will come crashing down and my entire life will be ruined\", it just seems to be \"I cannot do the thing\". I don't seem to have any physical symptoms, except for feeling exhausted. When this happens I usually end up napping for a few hours.\n\nIt's almost akin to depression, except for the intense feeling of \"I cannot do this\", as opposed to \"I just don't have the energy to do this\". I'm wondering if maybe it's a mix of anxiety and depression (I have both), or maybe a strange coping mechanism, or just the effects of my medicine.\n\nHas anyone else experienced anything akin to this? It'd be very nice to know.\n\nEdit: Thank god I'm not the only one! I was fairly worried that it was, ironically, all in my head. I guess I just had this misconception that severe episodes of anxiety can only manifest in standard \"freak-out\" panic attacks. Thanks so much.\n",

            "selftext": "I'm sure this has been done before, but I've got to rant and this seems the place to do it.\n\nI was diagnosed with anxiety a few years ago at the age of 26. I went through debilitating periods growing up where I had no idea what was going on. My parents thought I was faking attacks for attention. I was never taken to a doctor, never given medication. I dealt with these attacks in very, very poor fashion. First I used sports, and then turned to alcohol and drugs as I got older. I try to mask being petrified about meeting new people, large crowds etc. by acting out, and sometimes attracting negative attention. I will go to a new gym, get to the parking lot, and talk myself out of going inside because I can feel the adrenaline starting to rise. I want to get out and make new friends, but I am terrified at the thought of going to new meetups or social gatherings without someone I already know. \n\nI became pregnant last year at the age of 28, and had to quit my medication (xanax) cold turkey. Counseling helped some, but not very much. I married a man who doesn't have the slightest idea of what I go through. He tells me I have a good life, I shouldn't worry about anything etc. When I act out and worry/get stressed/have an attack, he would tell me I'm a horrible person, not nice, worry about stupid things, and a plethora of other comments that never helped.  \n\nMy mistake was not going back to my doc immediately, putting my kiddo on formula and getting back on anxiety meds. I wanted the best for my daughter and thought that was being breastfed. I wasn't concerned about me, but I should have been. It has ended up with my husband filing divorce paperwork and leaving me and my infant to fend for ourselves.\n\nAs you can imagine, that did not help things. Of course, my friends are all team my8ponies89, and his are all on his side. But when trying to explain how my anxiety contributed (I say that, because it wasn't all my fault that we ended up at this point) my friends don't understand. They say such things as:\n\n* just focus on the big picture\n* don't worry about anything. You will be ok.\n* shake it off\n* get over it (as said by my soon to be ex)\n\nDebilitating doesn't even describe what I go through when an attack happens. I can be sitting there, minding my own business, when a nasty thought enters my head. All of a sudden, my brain has torpedoes locked on that one thought, and we are going to fire and make that thought explode into fifty other thoughts about how bad things are, what could go wrong and how it's going to totally fuck me over. \n\nChaos ensues in my mind. Physically, my heart is beating so fast it feels like I am out on a run. I'm sweaty, I'm scared. My chest hurts. I can't breathe. On the outside, I may look only slightly amiss. But mentally, I'm a wreck. I'm helpless. It consumes me. My mind has my body in a jail cell in the depths of hell, and I am a prisoner within the confines of my head.\n\nI stay like that for what seems like hours, although it may only be a few minutes. I try to function normally. I have to take care of my daughter. I have to drive. I have to work. I have to do XYZ, but I don't even remember doing it half the time. \n\nThen, it starts to subside. I slowly regain focus and composure. I made it through one more. I can go on about my day.\n\nUntil the next one. \n\nI have an appointment today to try Paxil, which is safe for breastfeeding. Wish me luck. ",

            "selftext": "I'm 17 years old male and since I could remember I've had anxiety... I've always worried about things, scared of doing things, going out in the world, being in public.  I was sick of school, my grades were horrible, barely any friends, loner, not social, very shy and that quiet kid. So in 8th grade I talked my mom into putting me into online school so I didn't have to deal with that. Well that obviously just avoided the issue and didn't deal with what was the core problem that was troubling my life.   \n    \n  \n I'm now in 12th grade online still, and honestly the past couple years have been so wasteful due to my anxiety taking over me from being me, feeling free. I feel like anxiety was a cloud over my mind, and now it's finally clear, FREE TO BE ME! I AM ME NOW! I also suffer from social anxiety (online school didn't help) which is the **WORST**. Anyone who has social anxiety can agree. Any social situation I get in, I feel like my mind goes blank, my voice gets quieter and I just am a different person. As if I go in auto pilot mode and have no control whatsoever and freeze. Always looking around, worried people are looking at me or speaking about me etc, just WEIRD SHIT!  \n  \n**Last week I went in to a regular doctor checkup, mentioned anxiety and he offered paxil 10mg (my mother uses paxil too) and I wasn't sure.. But thankfully I took the offer. He said it takes up to 2 weeks, it's been 9 days now and it's kicked in/kicking in. 2 days ago I woke up, same as usual but I didn't feel that anxiety feeling.. I always have really bad anxiety when I wake up and I was in complete awe with a smile on my face. The first time I felt me and was able to be me with a clear mind. None of that foggyness/anxiety ridden mind. Overthinking, overlooking everything, feeling uncomfortable 24/7. All that's gone. \n\n  Today was my first day at my job(worked there for a few months, never really talked to anybody) with this and it was unbelievable, I was talking to people, laughing, smiling. I actually could hear myself talk with my normal voice, not that anxiety weird voice I get where I talk quiet and sound different, not the blank mind I get when trying to say something. Whenever I talked it just came out smooth without worry and it felt amazing.\n   \n  \n Now the only medication I started using for it was cannabis, that was around 16.. Wasn't until late 16/early 17 that I really started smoking regularly (on and off). Which caused other issues. But it was the only thing that made my worries/anxiety melt. Now since I'm on paxil I'm going to slow down my weed usage, but I do want to say that it does feel different being high while having no anxiety to begin with now. Defiantly going to be a after work thing now.    ",

            "selftext": "It just occurred to me that on all those years of me reading anxiety forums, combing them for some magic bullet to get me 'normal' again, I rarely found anyone saying \"this is how I beat it\". Most of the users on them were in the midst of the same fog I was. People rarely came back from the edge to say 'hang in there'.  So I thought I'd tell you how I beat it. \n\nYour anxiety might be different but I hope this helps in some way. I also hope this doesn't sound *gloaty*, I'm only writing it to make some good of a year and a half of hellish misery. \n\nBoth of my parents had respective nervous breakdowns in their twenties. I don't know if there *is* a genetic component there, but my money's on one being discovered in our lifetimes. \n\nAround July 2010 I had a bit of a turn. It was my last year of university. I had spent 3 years (18-21) drinking myself into an utter stupor. I was an alcoholic, though I hadn't given myself a break to actually find out if I was dependent on the sauce or not. Looking back, of course I was. I drank until I blacked out. I drank when no one else was drinking. All of this is probably typical student behaviour, but it was my persistence that separated me from all the other undergrads. I'd chase a hangover with absurd amounts of coffee in the morning. \n\nOne morning, sitting on a friend's bed in 2010, I lost my mind. That's the only way I can put it. I was hungover as hell and I'd just finished about 4 cups of coffee. The room spun away from me. It sort of receded, and my heart jumped to about 10,000 beats per minute. I felt a wave of panic but assumed this was just in response to what the room was doing. My first thought was: oh, I'm having a stroke. I jumped off the bed, excused myself quietly - this is what British people do when they suspect they're having a stroke - and spent the rest of the day curled up under my bedclothes trying not to die. \n\nI woke up the next morning feeling fine. *Well, that was odd* I thought. I got blown away the next night, chased it with coffee. This time it was worse. When the *stroke* hit, I couldn't swallow. I couldn't talk. *Oh fuck oh fuck oh fuck oh fuck*. It was a similar feeling to when you're just about to give a speech or lose your virginity or something, but supercharged. Again, bedclothes. But the next day I wasn't all right. I was wound up and suddenly obsessed that there was something wrong with my heart. There had to be: it was beating uncontrollably, doing samba rhythms, sometimes skipping beats arbitrarily. I gave up booze immediately. I gave up caffeine immediately. Still the samba rhythms and paranoia. When I tried to sleep, I was convinced I'd die. I'd just about get to unconsciousness and suddenly bolt upright. This might happen ten or twenty times in the course of falling asleep every night. This continued for about a year solid. I became a recluse. I went to doctors trying to justify it. They told me I had an anxiety condition. I insisted that I'd been exceptionally chilled out my entire life and that if they'd only examine me properly, I'd leave them be. I tried citalopram, a sort of mild antidepressant. I don't feel like it did a great deal for me but it's worked well for others, I understand. \n\nI won't go on about it. You're all likely well aware of the unrelenting panic attacks, nausea, shortness of breath etc. It's a cage you can barely describe. Even looking back on it now seems surreal.\n\nHowever, I wanted to throw out what fixed me because I suspect there are a few of you out there that'll read this and incorporate it into your own awesomeness. I worked up the courage to challenge the basis of my anxiety. I started going running. This sounds pretty small. It wasn't, back then. I was obsessed that I had a heart condition, and an imminently fatal one at that. Another part of my mind knew, *knew*, that I was 22, in reasonably decent health and with absolutely no history of heart issues in my family. The odds of an undiagnosed condition, after a number of doctors had looked me over, was astronomical. So I started off going on 5k runs through the countryside near my house. Then 10. Then 15. And in about 2 weeks, it wasn't such a big thing. And then it wasn't much of an issue. And then, half a year later, it was sort of a joke to look back on. I resumed being a social human being. I got my creativity back. I started lifting. I wrote a book. Then another. I went to live in Asia. \n\nI don't know whether any of you have ever taken too much of a drug; I have. It was cannabis and we ate it. We took far too much that night (years ago, before the anxiety). Everyone just passed out and slept it off. I stayed up completely out of my mind for about 24 hours, convinced my mind would never fix itself. I knew that I would always be this kind of insane now, it was set. I couldn't imagine ever coming down. The thought didn't compute. Well, anxiety for me was like that. Every projection into the future was marred with anxiety; every future relationship I'd ever have, every creative effort, every ice cream, kiss, movie and sneeze. It would all somehow get tainted with how I was feeling.\n\nWell it doesn't work like that. That's just your brain trying to be helpful and forecast the future. If science-fiction, technology experts and politicians tell you anything then it's this: **brains suck at predicting the future. Your own, especially.** They're trying to help you out, give them a break, but don't you dare fall into despairing because you're crazy enough to believe what they predict. Most people, statistically speaking, **do not** end up stuck with anxiety condition. It's an episode in their life, nothing more than that.\n\nI hope that helped somebody, I sure as hell wish I'd read something similar when I was going through it. \n\nMerry Wednesday\nEx :)",

            "selftext": "Brace yourselves, this is going to be long, and I apologize in advance for any grammar mistakes. \n\nBefore I tell you guys about my anxiety now, I'll tell you a little about my childhood so you'll get an idea of where I'm coming from. So first off, I was not one of those kids that had a traumatic childhood, I had friends, parents that actually cared, nice house and clothes, played and picked my nose a lot, just the typical kiddy things. Anyways, I was always really, really shy, not sure what caused that, but as a kid, one of my first memories was me standing on one side of the gym in preschool and wanting to play with the other kids, but at the same time, too scared, or maybe unwilling to go over, I don't really remember all that well. So yeah, I didn't really talk a lot, but I did make a few really good, close friends that I hung out with a lot, and even if i didn't know somebody that well, I never had problems with the other kids and got along really well with most kids. \n\nSkip to grade 5, I don't know what happened that year, but I suddenly HATED going to school, and this is where my anxiety became really bad, for whatever reason. I remember feeling this overwhelming sense of dread, and I would literally scream at the top of my lungs in the morning and literally have to be dragged to the bus stop and into my seat. My mom thought I was just being attention-seeking and not wanting to go to school at first, but this went on basically every day for months and eventually she took me to a doctor, who said it was \"just puberty\", which it definitely wasn't. At the time I don't think I ever understood WHY i hated school so much, I just knew I did, and looking back now, I still don't understand what made me act the way I did. So after that, my anxiety never improved, I just learned to \"suck it up\" and not make a scene because it was really embarrassing, and whenever I was given the chance to skip school, I did. So from that year, things kind of went downhill, and I slowly started losing friends and developing really bad social anxiety. Fast forward to sophomore year of high school, I was an absolute emotional mess and by this time I had begun to rock back and forth all the time (I still do sometimes) and my nail-biting/lip biting habits from childhood had gotten much worse. To add to that, I would have these periods where I would suddenly crash, and spend hours in my room on the floor crying for no reason. In addition to this, despite never having been to a 'psychological doctor' since the 5th grade, I was very aware I had severe social anxiety seeing as I literally could not properly function around other people, and avoided people so much so that other than school, I could count the number of times I left the house in a year on a single hand. It seriously sucked. However, I told myself I couldn't do anything drastic because I was almost done school (which I basically saw as a jail sentence), and soon, my real life would begin. \n\nSo, here I am now, in freshmen year of college, and let me tell you, this shit sucks. My entire life I've had this crippling fear of letting opportunities pass me by and of wasting my time (which is exactly what I did in my teenage years) and all this time I've had some fucked up illusion that finishing high school would magically cure my problems and would be my 'rebirth', or whatever stupid notions I had in my head. So yeah, basically, I have no friends whatsoever (that is not an exaggeration), never had a close relationship of any kind, do not trust people at all, have no hope for the future, and most importantly, have this constant fear of wasting my life/not being able to attain any goals I had for myself. \n\nI know it's easy to say 'go get help' or 'start making friends' or whatever, but way easier said than done. I really feel like I just need to leave and go somewhere far away for a really long time, and hope I find myself, but I have no where to go. On top of that, doing anything remotely foreign (riding the bus or eating out) terrifies to the point where i get physically ill. Pathetic, I know. I just really wish there was someone that could show me the way or something, because I really honestly have no idea what I'm doing and the thought of no future terrifies me. \n\nTL;DR: So my fairy-tale outlook of life after high school did not at all pan out to what I thought it would be, and I am now having a crisis as to what to do with my future/ how to attain a future. \n\nEDIT: Thanks for all the advice guys, much appreciated and it's comforting to know that other people are going through the same thing.

            "selftext": "So here's the scoop:\n\nMy anxiety is ruining college for me, and these are the five reasons why:\n\n1.  I cannot, for the life of me, concentrate on studying.  I've found that alternative methods sometimes work:  watching videos is one great one, because I can keep my hands busy with crochet which keeps my mind calm and focused.  But now I'm in upper level science courses and videos just aren't available.  I'm forced to rely solely on the textbook, which brings back something that has haunted me over the past two years of college:  I can't read.  Okay, so I am actually capable of reading (else, why would I be here?) but I lose concentration so quickly on it.  I read two sentences, and the rest might as well be in Russian because I scan it and don't intake it.  I get to the end of the page, ask myself, \"What was that about?\" and reply, \"I have no idea.\"\n\n2.  Tests feel like a heart attack.  Oh boy, tests are fun.  My heart tries to jump out of my chest, I have *even more* trouble remembering stuff than I usually do, and I just feel like crying.  I breathe deep - in, 2, 3, 4, 5, hold, 2, 3, 4, 5, out, 2, 3, 4, 5 - and I just *know* that people are thinking, \"I wish she would just shut up and take the test, none of us like exams!\"\n\n3.  Services on campus suck.  I summoned up all of my courage to go to our academic support services here (I was sure they'd just tell me I was stupid and lazy), and they asked me, \"Are you partying too much?\"  *Well, no, I don't ever go to parties.*  \"Are you going home too much?\"  *I've only been home once this semester.*  \"Sorry, we can't help you.\"  *Thanks.*  I am thankful for our Student Counseling Services, who provide 10 free sessions for every student, but everything else just tells me that I'm a terrible student.\n\n4.  I can't get over my own bullshit.  My therapist told me to go see our Office of Accessibility, and I just felt stupid coming into there.  Like, is my diagnosis even a *thing?*  It feels like mental health diagnoses are a lot like a horoscope; they can apply to everyone if you think about it hard enough.  And even if it is a \"thing\" is it really a disability?  I saw a blind kid walk in after me, and I thought to myself, *I don't have a disability.  I'm just making this up for sympathy.  I'm just lazy.*\n\n5.  I'm terrified of talking to professors.  Pretty often, I get an exam back, and I've done terribly.  And everyone tells me, \"Talk to the professor.\"  And what?  Listen to *him* tell me how stupid and lazy I am?  Listen to *him* tell me to read the book more?  I've already beat myself up over that.  I couldn't stand to go have my fears validated.",
