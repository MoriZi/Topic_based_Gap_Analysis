            "selftext": "Was given this as a CBT hand-out:\n\n1. **All-or-nothing thinking** (also called black-and-white, polarized, or dichotomous thinking): You view a situation in only two categories instead of on a continuum.\n\n    Example: \u201cIf I\u2019m not a total success, I\u2019m a failure.\u201d\n\n2. **Catastrophizing** (also called fortune telling): You predict the future negatively without actively considering other, more likely outcomes.\n\n    Example: \u201dI\u2019ll be so upset, I won\u2019t be able to function at all.\u201d\n\n3. **Disqualifying or discounting the positive**: You unreasonably tell yourself that positive experiences, deeds, or qualities do not count.\n\n    Example: \u201cI did that project well, but that doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019m competent; I just got lucky.\u201d\n\n4. **Emotional reasoning**: You think something must be true because you \u201cfeel\u201d (actually believe) it so strongly, ignoring or discounting evidence to the contrary.\n\n    Example: \u201cI know I do a lot of things okay at work, but I still feel like I\u2019m a failure.\u201d\n\n5. **Labeling**: You put a fixed, global label on yourself or others without considering that the evidence might more reasonably lead to a less disastrous conclusion.\n\n    Example: \u201cI\u2019m a loser. He\u2019s no good.\u201d\n\n6. **Magnification/minimization**: When you evaluate yourself, another person, or a situation, you unreasonably magnify the negative and/or minimize the positive.\n\n    Example: \u201cGetting a mediocre evaluation proves how inadequate I am. Getting high marks doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019m smart.\u201d\n\n7. **Mental filter** (also called selective abstraction): You pay undue attention to one negative detail instead of seeing the whole picture.\n\n    Example: \u201cBecause I got one low rating on my evaluation [which also contained several high ratings] it means I\u2019m doing a lousy job.\u201d\n\n8. **Mind reading**: You believe you know what others are thinking, failing to consider other, more likely possibilities.\n\n    Example: \u201cHe\u2019s thinking I don\u2019t know the first thing about this project.\u201d\n\n9. **Overgeneralization**: You make a sweeping negative conclusion that goes far beyond the current situation.\n\n    Example: \u201c[Because I felt uncomfortable at the meeting] I don\u2019t have what it takes to make friends.\u201d\n\n10. **Personalization**: You believe others are behaving negatively towards you, without considering more plausible explanations for their behavior.\n\n    Example: \u201cThe repairman was curt to me because I did something wrong.\u201d\n\n11. **\u201cShould\u201d and \u201cmust\u201d statements** (also called imperatives): You have a precise, fixed idea of how you or others should behave and you overestimate how bad it is that these expectations are not met.\n\n    Example: \u201cIt\u2019s terrible that I made a mistake. I should always do my best.\u201d\n\n12. **Tunnel vision**: You only see the negative aspects of a situation.\n\n    Example: \u201cMy son\u2019s teacher can\u2019t do anything right. He\u2019s critical and insensitive and lousy at teaching.\u201d\n\n",

            "selftext": "I started learning to drive when I was a teenager, but a lot of awful things happened and I developed full-blown symptoms of PTSD, which took me off the road for a few years due to medication side effects and so on. \n\nWhen I was 20, I decided to try learning to drive again. I was lucky enough to find a really nice instructor, and I was apparently a very good driver, but when it came time to do the test I fell apart - I failed it three times. The test examiner I got (I got the same one every time) was really cranky and stern, and it made me so unbelievably anxious to be in the car with him that I totally lost it and made stupid mistakes. After my third fail, I decided that it was probably not safe for me to be on the road, and so I gave up on driving for the time being. \n\nI am now 28. I have had a lot of treatment for my PTSD, and I have been doing really well lately - so I decided to attempt driving again. I have been for a few drives with my mother, and it was okay - I was relatively calm, I didn't make any big mistakes, I successfully drove on the highway and so forth. Encouraged by this, I decided to take some formal driving lessons to learn the specific stuff I needed to know for the test, etc. \n\nMy first lesson was....okay, but the instructor was really stern, and it made me nervous enough that I decided to book my next lesson with a different school. The school actually advertised as a \"No Yelling\" school, so I figured that their instructors were probably patient and friendly. I even advised the school that I was very anxious etc, so that they knew the situation beforehand. \n\nI just had my lesson with them, though, and it was absolutely horrible. From the minute I started the car, the instructor started talking to me non-stop in this really irritable/angry voice. His instructions weren't clear, and when I would do the opposite of what he wanted he would be all \"NO! I told you to do it this way!!\" He also kept calling me \"sweetheart\" in the most condescending way possible, and asking me questions about why I didn't have my license yet. When I told him the truth - that I was anxious and didn't feel ready - he would scoff and say that I was now too old to learn. And....I mean, I know I am embarrassingly old to be just taking my test now, but mocking me about it just makes me feel even shittier. He also kept asking me why I was so nervous, and when I told him that I was a generally anxious person, he started yelling \"Be more confident! You have to be more confident! You shouldn't be so nervous!\" at me. \n\nThe worst thing was that this affected my driving, just like it did last time I took my test. I was holding back tears for most of the lesson, and trying not to have a panic attack. I don't do well with being yelled at, nor do I do well being in extremely close proximity to a stranger, thanks to my PTSD. I became so focused on controlling myself and trying not to piss the instructor off even more that I made a whole bunch of stupid mistakes - which...I then got yelled at for. \n\nMy lesson was an hour ago now, and I am still in tears and trying not to hyperventilate. I feel so...ridiculously stupid, and incompetent, and weak. I feel like giving up on attempting to drive altogether. And it's so upsetting, because I have been doing so well and thought that I would be able to handle these kinds of triggers better - but apparently I am just as fragile as I have always been. It is just really, really disappointing and disheartening. \n\nWhen it comes to driving, I feel like...the actual driving is not really a problem - even when I have encountered sudden changes/dangerous conditions on the road while driving with my mother, I have dealt with it fine. But the social aspect of having lessons and dealing with having another (often cranky) stranger in the car with me is screwing me over and affecting my driving so badly that it's like I can't drive at all. I don't know what to do about it. \n\nThis was really long and ranty, so thank you to anyone who read this far. If anyone has dealt with this kind of situation before, I would love some advice. \n\n**TL;DR - I have PTSD and my irritable, shouting driving instructors are triggering me so badly that it's affecting my driving. The driving is fine, but I can't deal with the social aspect of having someone in the car with me. It's extremely upsetting.**",

I was all sorts of messed up before the interview, but I happen to know that I interview well, so I wasn't too bad. While in the interview, they told me that 128 qualified people applied, and that they narrowed it down to 20 and then 3 candidates to interview. They also let me know that the salary was more than double what I'm making at my current job. The interview went great and they told me that they'd reach out on Thursday.\n\nToday is Thursday, and needless to say, there is a lot riding on this phone call today. I don't know when they'll call, or even if they'll call and say sorry, someone else was better than you. And even if they do say yes, then I have to deal with the betrayal of leaving my boss and feeling bad for the other people who probably feel just like me today. \n\nMy anxiety is usually kept relatively at bay with breathing exercises, distraction, etc. I get 4-6 panic attacks/year. Today, I am a basket case. My stomach is a bucket of acid, I feel like I'm going to hurl, nothing sounds good to eat, and I can't focus on my work at my real job. I'm trying to breathe through it, focus on the fact that whether I panic or not, today is going to end and tomorrow is going to begin, tell myself that I have a 33% chance of getting the job, etc. But it's not helping. I'm hyperventilating, doomsdaying (I'll be stuck here forever, I'm never going to get hired at this company etc) shaking, and I don't know how I'm going to function all day without someone noticing. \n\nDoes anyone have any tips or help?\n\nTL;DR: I find out today if I'm getting an awesome job.

Worrying is the most consistant feeling in my life and I never feel secure. Embarrassing as it is, I can't seem to get myself together. My head is filled with endless lists I've made for myself and all I do is go over and over them. Its ruining my life and I don't know how to make it stop. How can I turn my mind off and just relax? I'm so miserable and desperate for help....",

            "selftext": "I apologize in advance for the tl;dr post\n\nLike probably most people here I'm always looking for ways to help curb panic/anxiety attacks. Today I felt myself \"coming up\" when a headache got particularly bad and I was focused on some other health issues + stress of homework.\n\nHadn't showered yet today so decided to shower to distract myself. Sometimes a long hot shower will bring my anxiety down a bit, but I found myself still shaky so I decided to try something new.\n\n(I wouldn't recommend this if you pay for water, haha)\n\nOnce I was done with all my shower necessities I sat down in the tub and started focusing on the water. I find that that the best way for me to lower anxiety is to distract my mind and have it focus only on the present moment, not worry about \"what ifs\" or blow things out of proportion.\n\nSo I sat under the hot (not too hot!) water and started focusing on the water hitting my body. Basically my inner monologue went something like:\n\n\"The water is hitting your shoulders. Don't focus on anything but the water drops hitting your shoulders. You can worry about x another time. Right now, focus on the water.\"\n\nAnd after a while I'd move so that the water was hitting something else. Instead of my shoulders, I leaned forward so it hit my back, or to the side, etc. I held my hands up and felt the water hitting my palms and running down my arms, and the entire time I just kept saying over and over \"You are alive and happy, healthy, and calm, and this is the water hitting your body. You don't know what's going to happen in the future, but you know what is happening. Right. Now. Right now, water is hitting you.\"\n\nI don't know, this might sound silly, but it really helped. By the time I got out of the shower I'd say my anxiety had gone from a 7 to a 3, from a scale of 1-9. Also bonus, all the hot water helped relax my muscles and ease the tension headache.\n\nSo I thought I'd just share this. I guess it's a form of centering meditation, to focus on your body in the present and ignore the racing thoughts going through your head. So sit down in the shower, relax, and meditate focusing on the water and where it's touching you and how that makes you feel, let it relax you, don't focus on anything else but that instantaneous present moment. You aren't allowed to focus on worries...let any worries you have go down the drain with the water. Let them roll off you in the shower so that when you turn off the water they're gone and you're just left with yourself and your happy thoughts :)",

Not just the school work, but having to see everyone and I get anxiety from the slightest social interaction from someone I don't know well enough. Every little thing I do wrong I feel like everyone is watching me and that they are all just judging me. Every time my grades slip the slightest I immediately start stressing out and worrying over my future and how bad I'm going to mess it up.\n\nBut thats only the surface, around march my parents had a huge argument and my mother threatened to kick my father out. I had been listening and I guess they noticed and called me down. That only made it worst. My mom tried to get me to agree with her and my dad, who just was trying to calm her down and talk it out, did the same. Eventually I was able to get them to stop for the night and go to bed. They have slowly been rebuilding but recently I have noticed a change and think they are most likely are going to divorce. I don't know why but every since the night of the fight i cant stop thinking of the idea of them splitting up and how my life would change. No matter where I am it will find a way to creep into my head and give me some sort of anxiety attack. I dont know why the idea of them splitting up messes me up so much, because I know lots of kids with divorced parents who seem to do just find. But every second of everyday I cant stop but worry and get so much anxiety from it. Its only been recently that its become overwhelming, but it has crippled me socially. I'm not suicidal or anything but it just wont stop creeping into my head.\n\nThanks for reading if you did, I'm just looking for a place to get it all out. ",
