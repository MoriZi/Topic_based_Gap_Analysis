I find myself still thinking of myself as that grossly overweight person and putting myself down in a myriad of ways. I've noticed strangers become confused and uncomfortable when I talk about myself as fat because I don't look that way anymore, and they didn't know me as the person I was before. My sweet child, who doesn't understand things like self loathing and anxiety, tells me every single day that I'm beautiful and the best mamma in the whole wide world. To my knowledge, no one has ever told him to say this or prompted him to do this. There have been days that I was so depressed I couldn't get out of bed and felt like a shit person and a shit mom because of that. He said it anyway. It made me smile when nothing else did. It got me out of bed. He has no idea that he helps me, he just loves his mamma. I must not be so bad after all. \n\n\nYes, I'm crying as I write this. It hits me in the feels, too.",

I feel huge amounts of guilt for the people I couldn't help or the people I think I should have done a better job for or done things differently for. I've been seeing a therapist, have had many reassuring conversations with friends and former colleagues that I could not have done anything differently, but I feel so bad all the time, like I am living with a great burden. I have other features of anxiety too that are unrelated to this (OCD, irrational fears, etc). My therapist is trying to get me to live comfortably with the worst case scenario, which is the idea that maybe I could have done a better job some of the time, but that's life. But it is really hard and I feel so guilty all the time. I can't enjoy anything good in my life because I feel that I don't deserve it.\n\nDoes anyone else feel this way? Have you experienced this?

It is so depressing.\n\nOr trying to explain why I still refuse to speak to my father. He's severely bipolar, has a quick temper, is verbally abusive to the point of making you feel like he will become physically abusive, is an insecure narcissist, is extremely racist, prejudice, hates people and is a conspiracy theory pscyho. He didn't like that I wasn't on his 'side' after another long psycho rant about 'blacks', etc, and told me he didn't want anything to do with me and hasn't spoken to me in 2 years. No matter how many times I try to explain this to the rest of the family it's like they're not actually listening to me.\n\nI guess what depresses/annoys me the most is that I have real trouble even trusting myself and when I feel justified in thinking that other people don't believe or trust me I feel completely worthless, like a non-being.",

There was a year I didn't have anyone tell me so me having no friends or whatever was...pretty clear to everyone else. It did sting just a tad bit about not having any friends who cared) and I didn't have to endure the awkwardness and everything else of not having any friends who care it's my birthday.\n\nBut one was a guy who I actually WAS pretty good friends with back in the day when we were in high school until he moved shortly after we graduated. Unlike usually when I would just tell people thanks and what little else I could think of to reply, I actually invited him to hit me up the next he might come back to our home town and maybe we could hang out since I missed him the last time (I was out of town the week he came)\n\nMe a few years ago probably would not have done that due to feeling the effects of social anxiety, even with him being an old close friend. \n\nThis might not be a \"big\" deal to the rest of you all here, but I'm proud of myself for at least trying, regardless of what might happen down the road. \n\nI've let anxiety control and ruin my life for far too often and long (though certain people haven't helped, but we'll ignore that for now).

Should I meditate before bed to just reduce my subconscious anxiety levels? When it happens the first time should I get up and try to relax and then go back to bed? Also, is it better to just go to bed way later when my brain is so exhausted that it can't really protest anymore?

            "selftext": "I've read a lot of threads on here about Klonopin vs Xanax, and having taken xanax as needed for panic attacks, I recently came off some light painkiller use and had started taking more xanax (still less than 1.5 MG/day) as I've been rather stressed lately. \n\nI went to my DR and basically said I didn't like the high/crash constant pill popping of xanax and wanted something that I could take in the morning and be good for...a while. Keep in mind, I've never taken SSRIs as I don't feel I have a chemical imbalance, but mostly that I am under a lot of pressure most of the time and get overwhelmed, not depressed so much.\n\nI got a precription for Klonopin 1MG twice a day (I only use it either 1 MG per day or .5, I just like being overprescribed so that I don't have to pay my psychiatrist each month or if I forget to make an appt I don't run out). As well as some xanax for breakthrough anxiety as needed.\n\nI have to say that I'm really liking the klonopin. Here's my breakdown as I see it, and again, this stuff works totally different for different people and I'm not a doctor.\n\nXanax (alprazolam):\n\nPros-\n\n* Great for breakthrough anxiety attacks\n* Great for knocking yourself out on a airplane, although there will be a hangover\n* Fast acting with a bit of a rush to know its gonna be okay\n* Great to keep in your pocket to ward off anxiety because you know you can diffuse it\n* If you smoke trees or do psychadelics, invaluable for getting you out of a freakout\n\nCons\n\n* Very short acting, meaning re-dosing often and riding a bit of a roller coaster\n* Very tough on memory, even .5 mg means I might get some brownout retrograde amnesia about what I did the previous day while on it.\n* Makes my stomach feel kinda weird, like empty and just a little uncomfortable\n* I don't drink much, but be careful with booze around xanax\n\nKlonopin (clonezepam):\n\nPros-\n\n*  Don't feel medicated, just feel rather normal and somewhat more confident, good for social anxiety\n*  The long acting properties means you don't think about it which (if you have an addictive personality) means you just kinda take it occasionally, but there's no reason to be popping these more than once or twice a day (morning and night is a popular regiment)\n*  Takes less than an hour to kick in, don't really notice it\n* Great for productivity, doesn't cloud thinking in smaller doses and lowers inhibitions in a good way.\n* Cuts off anxiety at its source, just seems to stop the worrying cycle\n* Takes the edge of smoking trees without totally killing your buzz\n* Nice warm feeling and relaxing\n* Less amnesia\n* Easier to get off of as it is longer lasting and tapers itself nicely\n\nCons\n\n* Not great for instant panic situations, although you'll have less of them.\n* Not very useful recreationally (yay!)\n\nHaving been using it for a few weeks now, I really really like it and how it helps me be the person I knew I should be. Meditation and talk therapy are also part of my regiment, but this is one medicine change I've been very happy with.\n\nI find the strength to be somewhat comparable, but to me 1mg xanax feels like 1.5-2mg of Klonopin.\n\nBest of luck out there, it's going to be okay.\n\n",

            "selftext": "18 year old male here\n\nWhen I was 13 or 14 overnight, I developed an extreme fear of school and going outside in general. I ended up isolating myself from school and all my friends for months. All my psychologist eventually concluded was that I \"had anxiety\" I eventually got over this fear and I finished high school. \n\nAfter a few years my 'fears' came back. I'm now a college student living at home and I am a complete social misfit. I lay awake every night thinking about how grim my life has been so far. I barely have any friends because outside school I avoid talking to *anyone*. My grades are bad and I can barely keep up with school. I lie to everyone, my parents, my friends to avoid having to go outside or see other people. I make up stupid excuses so I won't have to go to parties. I never answer my phone and on networks like steam I always have my status on offline so no one will talk to me. \n\nMy feelings are like a thick cloud that obscures my sight. I can't think clearly and I'm always somewhere else in my mind. I end up looking dumber than I am (especially in conversations) because I can't think clearly and it makes me feel like a stupid A-hole who is incapable of interacting with people.\n\nBasically, I isolate myself from everything and everyone. When I get home I lock myself up in my bedroom and I don't speak to anyone untill I'm forced to again the next day. I barely talk to anyone at school either, and no one seems to notice I'm perhaps a bit off...\n\nI have also not had a haircut in 3 years because I'm too scared to go to the hairdresser. I look like Hagrid from Harry Potter. It only makes me more insecure about myself. I never look people in the eyes when I talk to them and always hide myself behind my hair and my clothes like a little kid under a blanket.\n\nI'm also lonely. I just want someone to hug and to talk to in real live. A strong shoulder and all that. To make things even worse, I'm gay. I'm not out to anyone because I'm afraid of what people will think of me. not that I have any logical reason to fear for that. I'm lucky to live here. I feel like I will never find someone and I'm destined to be alone.\n\nIt's weird how overnight, I changed from a normal kid into an anxious social misfit. I feel guilty for whining.\n\n",
