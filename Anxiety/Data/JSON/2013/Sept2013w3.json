            "selftext": "I have panic disorder and agoraphobia. It got increasingly worse this past year, and July 17 I went on medical leave from my job. Aside from 5 Doctors/psychologists visits, I have not left my house once to go anywhere else. When I went to the doctors, I was driven, and I pulled my hoodie over my eyes. Two weeks ago, I started not even being able to go down to check the mail. \n\nFriday my psychologist told me it was time to go out. She said I was causing myself to get worse by being scared of the outside world. I get anxiety just from having delivery people come to my door. Just the thought of going for a drive seemed like an impossibility.\n\nToday I woke up anxious. Even after I took my medication, I was on pins and needles. I was dreading every second that went by, knowing I was closer to our(my fiance and mines) 3pm departure time. We chose that time specifically so the restaurant would be nearly empty. At 3 o'clock I started stalling and coming up with reasons why I couldn't go. At 3:45 he pushed me out the door and all but dragged me to the car.\n\nThe ride there was scary but I forced myself to just listen to his voice and not hide my eyes. I felt nauseous. When we pulled into the parking lot and He pulled me from the car, he hugged me and told me this will be fun and I am safe and he will protect me. We got inside the thankfully almost empty diner. Our waiter was so nice. He put me at ease a lot. I just chose something without really reading the menu because I just wanted to get the hell out of there. My fiance held my hand and just made small talk, making me start to laugh. I was able to relax a bit and even ate my sandwich! I was anxious, but I didn't feel like I was going to pass out or cry. We left and made it home with almost no problems!\n\nI am very anxious now that I am home(wtf self) but I am so glad I went! It was not nearly as bad as I thought it would be! I wanted to share this victory with you guys. This subreddit lets me know that I'm not alone. You people mean a lot to me &lt;3",

I always find myself thinking that my friends/family/SO dislikes me for some reason or another. Even if we haven't had an argument or anything, and nothing is going wrong, my mind seems to give me all sorts of a reasons why a person might be unhappy with me/dislike me - I guess it is a self-esteem thing, I generally feel \"inferior\" or \"unworthy\" compared to other people, sometimes I can pinpoint why I feel that way and other times I don't know why, it's just inherent. \n\nAnyway, I fear that people dislike me, which makes me nervous about how I look/act in front of them. As a result, I basically end up avoiding them because I don't want to annoy them/make them dislike me further. But usually this just makes people think I don't want to be friends anymore and we lose touch. I feel bad because I've lost a lot of friends due to this whole issue. I realize that evidently, avoiding people doesn't help friendships/relationships whatsoever, but I simply don't know how to stop constantly thinking that people secretly hate me. \n\nIt sounds really ridiculous when I type all this out.

Whenever I hear about possible snags in a project, or things that aren't 100% figured out, I get worried. I think about all the bad things that could happen, and I lose sleep over it. I stress out and I try to talk to people about it but most people are pretty dismissive. It makes me want to cry, but at the same time, I feel silly for basically whining.\n\nMost of the times, the problems I imagine never end up becoming actual problems, or if they do, it's never as bad as had imagined. Thus, I'm losing sleep over nothing basically. Which is really sad when I think about it.\n\nIt's frustrating because I know it's anxiety, I know it's irrational, but I can't help it because I guess my mind doesn't truly believe it. Sometimes I do breathing exercises, and it helps a bit, but it never really destroys the anxiety completely.\n\nAny thoughts?\n\n**TL;DR:** I worry too much over shit that usually doesn't even end up being that bad.

He is much more aware of how little income I make because his main motivation for work is paying off the mortgage and he's frustrated that I'm not doing more (I work from home, make my own hours, and am incredibly unmotivated because I hate my work too).\n\nAnyway I applied for an entry-level 9-5 job that I'm not qualified for (my friend who got hired even recommended me) and I'm having panic attacks while waiting to hear back (it hasn't even been 24 hours since I applied). I keep a good handle on my anxiety for the most part and have managed to stay off medication, but I don't have any close friends I can confide to and my husband is in no position to be receptive to my negative emotions. So I feel lonely, powerless to help my husband not hate his job, depressed and unable to gain motivation in my current job, stressed about if I'll get this new job, and just sad.\n\n/Rant.

Last night was my birthday, and I decided to have a small get together at my place which resulted in everyone drinking and getting drunk. At the time I was having a blast, but now I can't stop overthinking every detail of the night. Was I loud? Annoying? Obnoxious? Did I say or do something to make myself look stupid? Literally every detail of the night I can remember, I'm running it over and over in my head trying to deconstruct every second of every minute looking for what I could have said or done to look obnoxious or stupid.  I texted everyone who came this morning to thank them for hanging out, but very few have replied so I'm wondering constantly and really obsessing over the thought that they are upset with me, perhaps over me saying something stupid while drunk. I literally keep checking my phone every minute or so to see if anyone has replied. There was one point where my friend and I were singing along to a song we both know, and I accidentally said the wrong lyrics (even thought I know the words,) and he called me out on it, laughing. I laughed it off at the time but now I can't stop thinking about that moment and I feel like a total idiot.\n\n I don't think I'm going to drink for awhile. ",

A year ago I wouldn't have even been able to talk to a girl, but through CBT I've been getting slightly better (I also get worse panick attacks than I used to, though, so not entirely awesome) at doing anxiety-inducing things (read: everything). \n\nNow, I did get rejected by her, I dealt with it like a pro, stayed confident somehow and didn't even feel that stressed, the amount of pride I felt at being able to say it kept me calm, somehow. I felt really good afterwards, way better than I would've thought, even though she rejected me. This has been a major victory for me, I've been putting it off for months and just generally freaked out when I even thought about making a move (which made me panicky as shit when she was around, which is never good). \n\nGuess what I'm trying to say is that I never expected to feel calm or relaxed after something that important, while even small mundane things freak me out. Beating anxiety, even if it's just for an hour or so, feels so amazing, and even though I admittedly don't have it as bad as some people (I haven't vomitted through anxiety, for example...I've gotten close, but I can always manage it). \n\nI hope you can find some courage in this text, and do something you've been putting off because of anxiety, because I promise you you will feel so much better, even though it probably feels impossible to do, you CAN do it.",

            "selftext": "Hey folks, so I want to pass on some revelations that have been made. If you read my previous post, you would know that I was freaking out for weeks b/c I had been experiencing arm pain, numbness/tingling in my hands and fingers, including some serious spasms in my pinky finger. My wrists have also been weak, my elbows have hurt. Of course, being a hypo, I assumed I had ALS. I went to a new doctor because my insurance switched over. Before that, I was with KP, and they would simply just take my blood every freakout and tell me, \"You're fine, you're just stressed.\" \n\nWell, I got a new doctor on my new insurance and she's wonderful. I prefaced my visit by telling her, \"I have been diagnosed GAD. I know I'm a hypochondriac, but I'm experiencing some symptoms that are too real for me to ignore and I've been very scared.\" \n\nTurns out, yes, anxiety and stress have contributed to my problems. Instead of having a terrible disease, I actually have a lot of issues that have come from anxiety and stress.\n\nMy doctor did a great job of explaining to me how \"anxiety and stress\" ACTUALLY CORRELATE AND CAUSE symptoms, which I think is something that isn't anywhere near clear enough. \n\nFirst, she went over and began giving me a physical examination. She put her hand near the top of my ankle and immediately said, \"Relax.\" I am relaxed,\" I replied, but she said, \"No, relax.\" I realized that I had serious muscle tension, even though I swore I was relaxed. \n\nThen she asked about my symptoms, and I told her that I was getting numbness/tingling in my hands, weakness in my wrists and fingers, and arm pain. I was convinced it was precursing ALS. \n\nShe immediately had answers. She then said, \"So, you have anxiety. Do you have any nervous habits?\" \n\nSo I responded. My hands can't be free. I always have a hand on my chin, scratching and pulling on my beard...like when I'm driving, or just sitting. I also use my cell phone a lot in public, especially when I'm just bored while standing around and grab it and pull it out. I also do this thing where I constantly pick at my finger nails. I also always rest my elbows and sit with bad posture at my desk, which is not ergonomically accomdating either, because I use a laptop on it, rather than using the slide-out for the keyboard and mouse. \n\nTurns out, my ergonomic environment and terrible habits have caused a slew of minor, onset RSIs (repetitive strain injuries). \n\nI have carpal tunnel and cubital tunnel, which is explained by computer mouse usage, poor ergonomics, as well as bad posture, and something called \"cell phone or tennis elbow,\" which is caused by constantly bending the arms upward. \n\nThese conditions are caused from excessive nerve pressure, and while they are annoyances for sure, they aren't killing me! \n\nIt all comes back to how healthy we live our lives, and as humans continue to try to adapt to these sedentary lifestyles, we continue to put our bodies in an environment that's not completely fit. \n\nMy anxious habits (the hands-can't-be-free thing) and actual stress (muscle tension) have caused this. Exercise, meditating, and changing my lifestyle are the recommendations for improving. \n\nThe thing is, none of this is really explained like this. I think a lot of us go to source sites and just read, \"anxiety and stress cause pain, numbness, tingling,\" and we all think it's some rare, direct correlation. The truth is, anxiety and stress make us do things that put us at risk for this. \n\nMy stress has also caused my eye twitching, and my poor diet (according to her) is what is causing my muscle spasms. \n\nI'm really, really, really glad I've got a doctor who literally sat down and talked to me for an hour and explained everything to me, rather than just taking my blood, not seeing any warning signs, and kicking me out the door (like the docs at KP used to do). \n\nSuddenly, I'm excited to continue to change my life. I've always been a nervous wreck--always have spent wayyyy too much time at my computer...especially obsessing over my health, which is BAD. \n\nFinally, I feel like I'm constructively fighting my anxiety/hypochondria, rather than just believing I'm in a cursed body. \n\nInstead of going straight to Google to try to solve your fears, find a good doctor and get to the bottom of each and every symptom you feel. \n\nAs you begin to build confidence in the diagnosises, you can lower your overall stress and anxiety, which actually will make you less likely to experience more problems. \n\nI hope this post is good advice and a good example. \n\n",

Never have, nor do I plan to. I had absolutely no reason to be afraid of that yet I was freaking out.

It's holding me back from catching up with a lot of people because I don't know what to say.\n\nThe real answer is \"I've actually been doing nothing all year because I have depression and social anxiety which, coupled with my useless degree and lack of experience, leaves me unable to even start applying for jobs, let alone qualify for any. My mental condition is a struggle on a weekly basis even when I am doing nothing at all.\"  - which clearly no one wants to hear in light conversation, let alone at all really.\n\nThe question itself evokes so many emotions: rage - because who are they to question my life? Why can't I demand an explanation of their life plans or accomplishments? Anxiety, because it's putting me on the spot and I have to somehow lie and conceal the fact that I am having a horrible time at the moment and that I have no idea what I will do, and pretty much don't believe I will go anywhere or do anything in life. Annoyance, because its just a stupid small talk question, they don't actually care, they just want a discussion point and to be able to judge me, and I am sick of explaining myself 50 times a year. And more depression, because it just reminds me of how I am currently doing nothing because I am too incompetent to do anything. \n\nI'm imagining the next time someone asks me and I just want to be able to say fuck off, or just move on without answering, or more realistically just answer succinctly and change the subject, but I don't know how to do so politely. The only thing I can think of is to say \"nothing exciting\". Does anyone have any ideas or experience? How do I deal with wanting to jump out the window when this happens?",
