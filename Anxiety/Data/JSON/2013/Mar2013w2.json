This is because we have a LOT of practice with worrying.  We keep repeating the troublesome thoughts in our head, over and over.  We're rehearsing the idea, repeating it, and keep running it through our minds.\n\nThere is an opposite effect that could be happening instead.  We continue to rehearse, repeat and run it through our mind, but instead of focusing on the negatives(the worry, the fears, the problems) we focus on the \"hope\" or \"confidence\" (look at the positives of the situation, look at what you learned) then our problems will melt away. \n\nYou just need to change the focus of your thoughts.  \n\nWe need to realize that our human worth is infinite and complete because we exist, we need to resist falling into the mindset that so many corporations want us to be in, of needing external stimuli to feel complete. \n\nThe fact that you are alive is reason enough to celebrate, just focus on the positives of life instead of the negatives, we will enjoy our time on earth that much more.  \n\n\nI may have worded parts of that poorly, but I hope you all get the gist of what I am saying.  I know that this advice made tons of sense to me and helped something click in my head, and hopefully it can help some of you as well.",

I've been unemployed for 7+ months now. \n\nI know I should be out there resume spamming and using contacts. But whenever I start trying to apply to jobs, I feel really anxious, like my chest starts hurting and it gets harder to breathe. \n\nWhen I do apply, I spend too much time tailoring cover letters/resumes because I over-worry due to my anxiety, and then 99% of the time I get no response anyway. It makes me feel so completely horrible about myself. I basically go through this cycle where I send out a few applications on a good day, get no response, get overwhelmed with anxiety/depression for a long time, repeat. \n\nMy social anxiety is also a lot worse now, because I'm depressed and never go out anymore. So I can't even \"network\" and contact people who I know could help me in finding a job, because they're strangers, or I haven't talked to them in a long time and feel too anxious about it.\n\nEven friends/family/acquaintances just asking about the job search is enough to make me feel panicky. Like I literally feel a wave of rising panic whenever anyone mentions it. I have to force myself to remain calm and act like nothing's wrong.\n\nI don't know what to do anymore. I can't keep going like this, but I don't know how to fix any of it.",

            "selftext": "I do this to help myself, and since then I have had great control over my ability to kill anxiety when it comes up.\n\nGo into a room with a reasonable amount of space to walk. Take a deep breath, place one foot in front of the other, heel to toe. Say out loud (preferable) or in your head, right foot, left foot, ect.\n\nEvery step with your right foot, say right foot. Every step with your left foot, say left foot. Once you get the hang of it, also incorporate inhaling and exhaling into your monologue. \n\nInhale, right foot, exhale, left foot. \n\nNow do the same thing, except walk backwards. \n\nHere is what you're going to learn from this and why it will help you. Every single time you lose your balance or falter in any way, take note of how your imagination was running wild. Every time you misstep, it is because you have lost concentration from the present moment, and have begun thinking.\n\nDo this for about 25 minutes, and notice how quickly you improve in your balance. Your balance will improve from your mind gaining clarity. Pay special attention to how out of control your thinking process has become, and learn to safeguard your mind from the static noise of thinking. \n\nHappiness exist only in this very moment, not past or future. This exercise will help you return to the present moment where you can feel calm and happy. \n\nTips: Take one footstep for each inhale, and one footstep for each exhale. Walk and breath slowly, for it will challenge you greatly. Put your awareness into only your breathing and each foot you are using. Focus on your inhale and how your lungs fill with air and become full, and then how wonderful it feels to exhale, and that moment in time between the inhale and exhale. Every time you catch yourself thinking, stop. Continue the exercise.\n\nOnce you have finished this exercise, you can test yourself easily to gauge improvement. Say to yourself out loud with your eyes closed \"I wonder what my next thought is going to be.\" Put all your attention and energy into identifying what your next thought will be. \n\nThe time between when you say this, and when you have a thought, is called presence. The more you practice, the longer your presence will last. \n\nAnxiety cannot exist in the present moment. Free yourself by getting here.\n\nPlease feel free to share your experiences. \n\n",

I've had episodic depression in the past (normally when I go through a big change), and my family has a history of struggling with mental illness. I have recently gone through a big change (graduated from college).\n\nI have been thinking about death more and more lately (not suicide but the fact that everyone dies). Even reading about historical things, I can't help but think about how all the people I'm reading about are now dead and someday me and everyone I know will be too. This scares the shit out of me.\n\nI want to just enjoy life and the people in it and get what I \"want\" out of life. Problem is - I have no idea what I want so I'm constantly second guessing myself. \"Is this what I want to do? Is this what I want out of life? How will I be able to tell? How can I tell if this is better than plan b or c or d? What is wrong with me...shouldn't I know what makes me happy?...etc, etc\" and obviously it spirals out of control from there.\n\nIt's gotten to the point where it affects my mood at times. Sometimes I'll have random \"freak out\" episodes where I'll feel like my life has been a dream and I don't know myself or anyone in it.\nI am taking advantage of a really amazing opportunity right now (volunteering in a beautiful country for a few months) and want to make the most of it. I don't want this negativity to affect me anymore. I know I've been rambling but any advice would be so appreciated.\n\nSide note: I used to take antidepressants but went off of them about two years ago. I have been doing fine until recently.\n\nTLDR: I am hyper-aware that every choice I make contributes to the sum that is my life, so I'm constantly second-guessing my choices.

            "selftext": "Hey, so this is my first post here... Just feeling a bit lost. \n\nSo I've been seeing a therapist for the last few months. It used to be a weekly session but I had trouble keeping all the appointments (it was an early morning appointment and one of my main problems is getting to sleep) so I got downgraded to once a fortnight. In the last session she said that she felt like I was giving excuses for everything and not really trying, so she was thinking that we should stop the therapy. Which I was kinda annoyed about at the time, but I think I mostly felt like I didn't really like the things she was suggesting to me and I didnt want to do them. So I realised it was probably my fault for being resistant and decided to get stuck in a bit more. \n\nSo this week I did several of the things we agreed, like going to the shop to get my phone fixed (it's been broken for like 6 months and I've been too nervous to go to the shop for it). I was quite positive about the session and thought she'd be pleased for me that I was finally doing things she wanted me to. \n\nBut nope, at the end of the session she said we should stop again. I think the only reason that she didn't end up cancelling the therapy last time was because I cry a lot and it makes her feel bad. It seemed like the whole point of this last session was to make sure I'm not depressed or overwhelmed or anything before she closes it off. \n\nTo be honest, I'm not that sad about it. The last session for example was really awkward. She didn't have anything to say; she suggested that I ask my friend to go out somewhere and spent most of the time talking about different cafes in the area and giving me detailed instructions on how to get there, just to fill time. I think I just liked having someone there to report back to each week to sort of enforce some responsibility on myself, because when you're by yourself it's really easy to just drop back into push-everything-to-the-back-of-my-mind mode and not getting anything done even if you have the best intentions. I didn't really feel like she 'got' me, though, so it's probably for the best, I just feel a bit lost. I don't really feel like my anxiety has improved over the last few months, though I've been getting more 'tasks' done.\n\nShe didn't exactly just cut it off, she did ask if I want to continue, but it seemed pointless if she was just going to continually suggest that we drop it and didn't feel like she was helping me. I just don't really know what to think now. Could she just not help me? Did she think I didn't really have a problem?\n\nThanks for reading if you got this far, you're a better person than I :P\n\nEdit: Just to add, therapy is definately an interesting experience. I don't want to discourage anyone who's considering it. ",

            "selftext": "Since I just found this subreddit and don't have much time, i'll try to keep this short and sweet. I've had anxiety and all its related goodies for 3+ years now, and I still do. My first panic attack was when I was driving and I was hospitalized afterwards for a couple days to monitor me, and as it goes, after that first episode it wasn't too bad, but it surely grew worse. \n\nMy I ended up going from a normal guy to having GAD, but it was the worse when I was driving, funny to think someone that loves driving so much can change to not wanting to drive at all in such a short time span. But as you know, everything got worse, and it sucks.\n\nWhat helped? Meds helped a bunch, went on klonopin, everything was better, almost back to normal as long as I took my little buddy that I carried around in my pocket. But after a year (And I only took .5mg a day normally, sometimes twice) it started to lose its effectiveness, to the point I was taking 3-4 just to drive to see my girlfriend. I didn't like that, and everything started to spiral downwards again.\n\nAlot of stuff you read online about improving it, while I'm sure it works in some cases, I could never commit to following through anything to make my anxiety better, I tried all those self help anxiety books, and while they gave me hope, nothing truly worked for me. I went through a bunch of rough spots.\n\nFinally a bit over a year ago my mom got a referral to a therapist( She is a LWS, Licensed Social Worker, I don't know if that makes any difference at all, but thats what it says on her card lol). Like many people I did not want to go, I didn't want to talk to someone about my problems, how would that help. I was stubborn and thought it was a waste of time. \n\nAnyways, nothing else was working so I went anyways. The first session was just getting to establish some information and talk about my problems and how we could work on it. It wasn't easy let me tell you. Heck getting dropped off at the therapist was hard in itself. but it was one of the best choices i've made in my life. \n\nWe worked on CBT and exposure therapy. She didn't want me to think positive and happy-go-lucky with CBT, she wanted me to think realistically. Yeah sure I may have a panic attack, and yes it will fucking suck balls, but its not a heart attack, and i'm not going to die, ill get over it. Realistic, not positive. If your so positive about it, your just going to let your self down, I had to set realistic goals, go 1 more mile this time, dont try to go 2 miles. Try to goto the grocery store, and if I start freaking out, i mean its only like 2 miles from my house, ill be okay.\n\nSo couple CBT with exposure therapy, which meant I had to tactfully get out in the world and PUSH myself to have anxiety. See this is the hardest part, how can you overcome anxiety, if you are too afraid to ever face it? Its not easy at all. But you can't. You CANNOT overcome your anxiety if you always run from it. I learned this the hard way, but I stuck it out. Along with CBT, exposure therapy, my meds, I managed to make it work. \n\nI started to make progress. Small at first, and then more later on. I learned that I did indeed have a heart condition, which coupled with the anxiety, always gave me bad palpitations, since I had an arrhythmia. I even had a surgery for it, but they couldnt fix it, made it a bit better, but its still there everyday lol, and I don't want the more intensive surgery to correct it, but as my anxiety levels has gone down my palpitations are less frequent. \n\nI also suffer from chronic insomnia, and the last probably 8-10 months I have been taking my meds solely at night to try to help me sleep, but the same deal is i'm taking more meds and they arent working. So I quit my anxiety meds 2+ months ago. I still carry them around in my pocket but I haven't taken them. \n\nI went from being crippled, relying on meds, to now being able to drive 30+ miles, 30+ minutes. I could barely drive to the damn grocery store without having a panic attack. I still get anxiety, let me be honest, I'll never get rid of it, you probably wont also. But I have it under CONTROL. Its an ugly beast and it can still break free, but I know how to deal with it now. \n\nAll thanks to my therapist that gave me these homework assignments to push myself, who made sure I was making progress. If I didn't go see her I would probably be a lifeless shell by now. Not all of them are the same, you have to find a good one. BUT PLEASE DONT BE SCARED TO GET HELP, I AM A SUCCESS STORY BECAUSE OF IT, YOU CAN BE TOO. ",

At first the word was \"shit\" but it has progressed to become \"zip\". I first tried to repeat it without a rhythm to keep it interesting but settled on just repeating it as quickly as I can. Sometimes I can regain composure completely, other times for long enough that I can get myself back into a comfortable situation and settle down. It doesn't work always though, of course, but it seems to reliably help. \n\nI believe the reason this helps is that zip is a word not easily pronounced in my head so I have to focus on it to make the z sound come out clearly. I also focus on not moving my mouth as I do so because I'd look like a weirdo otherwise. I find this helps to distract me from the irrational fear by keeping my mind from wandering to the thoughts that make me anxious in the first place - namely, the self-fulfilling self-consciousness that causes me to show symptoms which in turn causes me to feel self-conscious.\n\nThe concept is simple enough so really this is about the execution. \n\nI stumbled across this subreddit today and figured I'd share what little I have to offer, hopefully it helps somebody.",

I am about to fail two classes, classes that I was passing up until two weeks ago because of this. I had a bunch of assignments and two finals this week and could not bring myself to work on any of them due to this anxiety. For one class I had six assignments totaling 20% of my grade and a final worth 30% due today and I have not worked on either even though I  had an A before two weeks ago. This morning I decided that another class with a final due tonight, 35%, was more important so I decided not to do any of that work and work on that final. Didn't start it until about 3 hours before it was due and took a look at it and don't know how to do it because I couldn't bring myself to review during the week. \n\nI am really worried for my future because I know I am intelligent and I am capable of doing well when I apply myself, I just cannot get over the anxiety that washes over me when I attempt to start an assignment. \n\nI failed out of one university for this same reason and am trying to get through an online college so I can get a degree. I have been seeing a professional once a month for 8 months and he has been helping quite a bit, but in the past two weeks I really screwed up. I am going to keep trying until I get this degree, but I know I can do more  with myself than finish a degree at an online college. \n\nHas anyone overcome this kind of procrastination?",
