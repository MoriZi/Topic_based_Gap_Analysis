            "selftext": "I just got back an hour or so ago from my first stint of volunteering at a barn. The reason I'm posting about it is doing something like this might help others like I can feel it helping me. I'm currently unemployed and looking for work, and it's taken me a long time to work up the gumption to look for a little bit of volunteer work to fill the time. My main goal was to volunteer doing something that made me happy.\n\nThe barn I volunteered at today is attached to a school for children with special needs (medical, disabilities, etc). Some of the kids get lessons that are, more or less, equine therapy for them. My job was to be in charge of the horses and lead them around the ring. I have some horse experience, but even so I was very nervous about today. What if the animals could sense my anxiety? Would that make things more dangerous for the kids?\n\nActually, my anxiety lessened a lot when I was around the horses (and one pony). It was almost like biofeedback, where you can visually see what your mental state is doing. So I made a point to relax, and the horse next to me relaxed. By the end of the fourth lesson and the end of my volunteering time I wasn't at all anxious. There were even some instances where the horses would presses their noses or heads against me affectionately, as if they liked me and I made them feel better for being there.\n\nIt was so nice to feel like I can do good again. If you have an opportunity to just give a little time to something like this it's worth it for you. Even if it's only an hour a week. Today, honestly, was therapy for me that was effective in a way that pills and professionals are not. Both have their place, but this was just...different. And good.\n",

Replaying conversations over and over again, wondering how people interpreted things you said, and obsessing over the worst possible way they could have interpreted something (Even though they probably didn't and could care less). Doing double the work you normally would because you expect someone to say something about not doing your job, their job, and everything else. Freaking out wondering how to call or text someone you want to talk to but have no idea how to say hi. Re-writting the same text 100 times, trying to make it sound right, but it still sounds wrong. Thinking in your head, and then worrying if it was actually thinking or if someone heard you. Not doing the things you really really WANT to do, because your freaking out that someone somewhere is going to have something to say and tell you can't do it (and you believe them), or just telling yourself that your not good enough to do it and your GOING to mess it up somehow. Someone asking \"Why?\". \n\nUGH it's just such complete and utter crap. WHY DOES ANXIETY HAVE TO BE A THING!!! D:\n\nWhy can't it just go away, and feel normal for a change?\n\n",

            "selftext": "I want to be clear, that my SO has not been diagnosed with an anxiety disorder.  However, IMHO, she exhibits many of the traits associated with GAD.  She is a very intelligent woman, and I feel she is aware that her anxiety is interfering with her day to day life and just generally making things difficult.  However, she is not ready to admit this to herself.  She has implied, over our time together, she is afraid of being labeled as \"crazy\" (as in if she was ever to be diagnosed with a mental health issue).  I have also delicately brought up therapy (not necessarily specific to her, just in general), and I have been met with a response something like this \"Therapy might work for some, but it's just not for me\"\n\nAnyways, here is the specific situation I'm looking for advice on.  This was our text conversation this morning:  http://imgur.com/a/OoVmf\n\nOur relationship has been rocky recently, due to her anxiety/depression.  It is something we both need to talk about in length.\n\nShe recently quit one job, and took another in the same field (medical coding).  I think she has realized that she really does not like this field and wants to change.  Yet, she can't find a job in the field she wants (private pharmacy/non-retail), and feels stuck.  She has talked about walking out, and just generally being miserable.  It has been progressively been getting worse.  OK, r/anxiety, what are your recommendations?  I love her and want to be supportive, I just know I have a tendency to take the fixer role (trying to work on this myself and be more empathetic).   I will be checking back throughout the day, and will answer any specific question asked.",

I feel queasy (lump in my throat). I get scared of miscellaneous crap, just whatever pops into my head. Going to a music festival next week? I think about how scary going to sleep will be.\n\nI want to travel? Will I be able to because of my anxiety? Anxiety about my anxiety is keeping me up for christs sake.\n\nAnd then I wake up and everything is fine and dandy, I'm refreshed and laugh at myself for being scared about something that is completely trivial. Then the day comes to an end and I'm up all night because I'm so scared of my own mind and thoughts that I feel physically sick.\n\nEdit: Fuck it, I don't know how I keep forgetting to mention this. I have intrusive thoughts of suicide. I'm terrified of death and want to survive, but I keep getting intrusive thoughts that are basically \"gotta do work? off yourself\", \"worried about something trivial? off yourself\", \"miscellaneous bullshit here. off yourself.\"\n\nThese bother me a lot because I get worried that they may become a compulsion that I could act on if I fall into a \"proper\" depression as opposed to my regular detached mindset.",
