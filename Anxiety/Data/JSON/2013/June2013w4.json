The last 6 months I was always worried I contracted HIV in the back of my mind whatever I was doing. I finally made myself get tested and it was negative yet I just found something else in my body to worry about. No amount of rationalizing make my worries go away, and since I'm only 19 I'm really scared this will be the rest of my life and I'll never be able to enjoy life.

Everything to me is so indescribably complex that I feel I have a responsibility as a human being to try to understand as much of this system as possible. While life is an experience I am grateful to have, it is causing me a great deal of anxiety. Basically what's been happening lately is I've been imagining Earth as an organic spaceship hurtling through space. Then I realize that I am a part of earth and by extension, the universe itself. These thoughts lead me to recognize the now cliche idea that I come from stardust, \"I\" am just otherwise unconscious atoms arranged in a particular order, the boundary between myself and everything else is an illusion, time as we know it is a human construct, and that I don't really exist. It's at this point where I kind of forget how to do things that should be automatic such as breathe, swallow, or walk and suddenly become aware of all my bodily processes that I do not control (kinda like that old 4chan copypasta). As you can probably imagine, these thoughts and sensations are amplified when smoking certain strains of cannabis. \n\nIsn't it strange how the only thing I've ever really been familiar with (myself, this world, this body) is causing me so much anxiety? Yet at the same time I am grateful to have these thoughts and question reality, which unfortunately is not the case for many people. I'm grateful to feel this obvious connection to the universe even though it gets scary at times. Now that you've gotten a glimpse at my perspective on things you can probably imagine that I have a bit of trouble functioning in society. I find it hard to convince myself to go to work to sell people expensive shit they don't need so I can buy expensive shit I don't need. I'm unsettled by the fact that I'm trading hours of my life for money. Sure, I could easily say \"fuck it\" and quit my job, go join a commune, and live off the grid, but I have become too accustomed to modern comforts. I want too much and I enjoy material goods (like my $600 phone that I'm typing this on) but I realize what I have and what I want are completely worthless in the long run. My friend who is really into meditation has told me that my wants are too small, which I agree with wholeheartedly.  \n\nI think that life is too beautiful and too strange to waste time on pursuing capital. But what do I know? I am just another directionless 18 year old asking unanswerable questions while attempting to function in a sick society.

I finally got up the courage to go. I was terrified but for the first time in a long time filled with hope. I was finally making the first step to bettering my life. I told the dr everything and he told me \"borrow money from family and see a psychiatrist\" I explained that the closest one is 45 minutes away and I have panic attacks in cars. He said, verbatim, \"suck it up, agoraphobia isn't that bad, one of the main characters from the sopranos had it, and got help\" I feel like he belittled my problem and then compared it to a fictional character. (I've never seen the show so I don't know what he's talking about) I told him that I had a son and he tells me it's not fair to my son that I don't leave the house and he's sure my son would like to go to a park or something. I know this and beat myself up daily about it. He asks if I'm going to go to the ER every time I panic when I told him a few times I didn't know I was panicking. I left the place in tears and all he gave me was \"get help, good luck.\" I feel like all this was a direct kick in the face. Idk where I was going with this. I just wanted to tell someone. ",

Any time she doesn't text back right away of says she'll call and gets delayed for some reason I start to think she might be seeing other guys or is getting annoyed with me. She called last night but the call kept getting dropped and she said it was bad service but I can't help to think she was lying. \n\nThe problem is I can't be jealous because we haven't established any kind of exclusivity and although she's given me no reason to suspect she is untrustworthy I have a lot of trust issues. \n\nI only got 2 hours sleep last night and had to call in sick to work today because my anxiety is overwhelming. How do I combat this and not let it ruin what me be a good relationship. ",

            "selftext": "\"I've had good luck all my life,\" he said.\n\nPeople have said this before to me in an offhand \"I suppose it's true\" way, like they're just saying things they don't really believe. But this old Australian man who was driving me to Saltspring Island was saying it in a new way. He was saying it with the tone you'd say \"I have anxiety\" or \"I was born in Geneva\"- not a story you need other people to validate, because you know it's true.\n\nI'll often carry on conversations just to humour the person who picks me up hitchhiking. But in that moment I was purely curious. \"Why do you think that?\" I asked.\n\nHe related a few stories, starting with a narrow escape from decapitation in rural India, ending with being on the board of directors of several successful companies. He seemed to be well-off, so I believed him on the last part. \n\nHis name was Lee, and sometimes I see old people who want young people to confirm that they're still cool, he honestly didn't seem to give a shit about that. But he wanted to talk. So I listened. \n\nHe explained that a friend of his had once been in a really bad spot and asked Lee if he could borrow his good luck for six weeks. Lee said OK, and handed it over (I don't know how). At the end of the six weeks, it had apparently worked so well that he didn't want to give it back, but Lee forced him to (again I don't know how). \n\nAt this point I became aware that I was sitting in a car with either a madman or a wizard, and it mostly depended on whether or not I believed in magic. \n\nI suspended my disbelief and let my curiosity come back forward, and asked him what I really wanted to know \"Why do you think you have such good luck?\"\n\nHe smiled because he knew he'd got me hooked and he said \"you want to know?\"\n\nI said \"yes, I do.\" \n\nHe said \"I've talked to strangers all my life.\"\n\nThroughout the rest of my life, the words \"good luck comes from talking with strangers\" is the only advice I've ever remembered to follow. When he said that, I had to acknowledge that at the same time that I had huge resistance to opening up to strangers, causing me great anxiety, I also benefited hugely from every time I did so, and it wouldn't be inaccurate to call it \"good luck\". I feel more in tune with myself when I talk with strangers, I find new opportunities, I just feel like I'm living in a better world when I realise that the person sitting next to me on the (yikes) metro or at the (scary) bar laughs at the same silly joke that I like. But I only find it out through exploration.\n\nI'm not offering advice to anybody on this sreddit because I know we find our own small quiet consistent ways that work for us no matter what grand advice comes parading through our daily thoughts, but I thought the story might come in handy. \n",

It's very much in my genes. \n\nWhen my problem started to get bad, around 16/17 (I am 22 this year) I was having a terrible time. I looked on the internet and that seemed to make it worse, everything would set it off. I realised it's just a bad thought pattern, I would worry about something and go around in circles in my mind over and over whilst the anxious feeling would get stronger. So I said to myself I have to break those thought circles... As soon as a negative thought would come up I chose to ignore it, move on to a different thought. At first this was hard... I was basically reprogramming how I thought but after a few weeks of this my problems basically disappeared. I started smoking weed a lot more with friends and just having a good time, something I would never have been able to do. \nWhy am I posting here if I am over my problems? well to be honest anxiety is something that will never go, you just have to learn to deal with it. Occasional I will slip back into that bad pattern of thinking but it is nothing like it was. I hope that my story helps some people who think they are stuck with anxiety.

            "selftext": "Perfectionism mostly affects my studies but it affects other areas of my life as well. Here are a few examples:\n\n- When taking notes and I write a letter/word/number which is asymmetrical (for example not written with the same pressure as the rest of the text/numbers or if it's not the same height as the rest of the text/numbers) or if it, for some reason, just doesn't look perfect I feel the need to erase it and rewrite it over and over again until it looks/feels right. It's not uncommon for me to have to do it up to 10 times or something.\n\n- I can't hand in an assignment/essay unless I think it's perfect. The way it's written, the layout etc. What's weird and irrational is that even though I know, after having read the text loads of times repeatedly, that I can't make it better I worry that the document will somehow become flawed/imperfect when I send it in. Example: I use a Mac and write in Pages but the teachers often want Word files so I need to export my Pages file to a Word file. Even though I've checked it multiple times and I'm sure that I've in fact sent in a Word file my mind tells me that maaaaybe it's changed back all of a sudden, which makes me anxious. Things like that.\n\n- If I don't know everything about something (when studying) I get very anxious. If there's something I don't understand and no one explains it properly I get worried and I freak out a little bit.\n\n- I read and reread things (posts like this as well) I've written countless times in order to avoid spelling mistakes and grammatical errors. Both before and after posting/sending it.\n\nThose are just a few examples. I generally have a problem with asymmetry and things not being/feeling right. Facts, details, rules and order are all very important to me.\n\nCan anyone relate to this?\n\nEDIT: Deleted a sentence.",
