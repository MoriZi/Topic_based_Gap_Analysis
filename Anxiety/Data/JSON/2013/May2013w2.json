            "selftext": "I've struggeled with social anxiety, depression for quite some time now. Since last year, it had gotten so bad that I haven't left my house. \nI don't want this to get worse and I really want to live a normal life again. Everyday I'm going to take it slowly. One step at a time, day by day. Its scary, but I know deep down its much scarier in my mind. I don't want to be my own fear. Theres so much in the world and so much to experience. I want to find myself again. To enjoy past hobbies and going outside and breathing fresh air everyday. The world is so huge that it can feel like it can be too much to handle. We need to remember that everyone lives their own lives and we all struggle to some degree. Its ok to be scared and not know what to do or how to handle situations. The first step is to just push yourself just a little and then keep adding on. I know I can do this and I'm ready to take as much time as possible to get me back out there. Slow progress is still progress. You can do it as well if you're in a similar situation as I am. You may need help and motivation from other people and thats fine.\nAt the end of the day, its just you. Spend your time doing what you love because that's all that matter.\n\n\n**Edit**: I managed to go outside for a while today. It honestly felt strange. I felt anxious, I was worried about people seeing me. After a while, I was more comfortable. Maybe I felt ok because I haven't been outside since the winter and it is very warm out now. It was nice. Tomorrow I will try to push myself to go for a walk around the block. After that, try and talk to some people. Thank you for all your support and motivation guys! :) I know that we can all beat anxiety one day. ",

I am leaving my home in MS today to fly to San Diego to start a new job! I'm very excited, but as I'm sure you can imagine, VERY anxious. This is the farthest I've been from home (besides a family trip to Belgium) and the longest I've ever been away from my family (especially my 4 year old daughter). I don't even really know why I'm posting this. I suppose it's just to \"vent\" about the anxiety I'm feeling and hope for some positive feedback/words of encouragement. Hopefully though, this will  be a bright new beginning for my life and I just wanted to share with you guys! Thanks for reading and thanks for being an awesome community!

We don't know why we're scared of things - I'm fucking terrified of the goddamned stove. And, at least I feel like whenever someone asks me why I'm anxious or scared, it's a combination of flaunting in my face the fact that I don't know, and the fact that they can overcome their fears. \n\nNow, I'd love to tell people about this. I have lots of people who try and help me, specifically my mom, but they say these things all the goddamned time, no matter how much I tell them it hurts.\n\nAnd then, it's followed up by \"Why are you getting so angry? I'm just trying to help. I'm on your side.\" or something of that nature. Now I can't fucking explain myself, because if I do they're just trying to help, and I'm just being an asshole or something. Then it's inevitably followed up by the \"Well when you get angry at me, I feel like I can't say anything or help \" AS THOUGH THAT FUCKING EQUATES TO WHAT I'M FEELING. \n\nAnd you know what, these people aren't bad. I know that. They are, after all, just trying to help, but what really hurts me is when they ignore my pleas for them to stop saying things like that to me, then complain about how they're \"Walking on eggshells!\" around me, all because I don't want them to remind me of my inefficiencies as a human being. \n\nThese are people who don't get it. They've never felt like they were overwhelmed with life and anxiety, so they can't POSSIBLY FUCKING IMAGINE how anyone else could be. It just blows my goddamned mind that even after being TOLD that they are being giant flaming doucheballoons, they still continue \"trying to help!\". \n\nAnd you know what, I try and be nice. I try and explain why I feel the way I do, and then get immediately interrupted by \"OH YEAH I FEEL THE EXACT SAME WAY I GET SCARED SOMETIMES YOU SHOULD JUST STOP BEING SO SCARED AND DO THINGS\". It's frustrating. \n\nMore so frustrating when you get the person who tells you exactly what you know. \"You really have to do your schoolwork. I know it's boring, but you really just have to power through it.\"\n\nI. FUCKING. KNOW. THIS. I. FUCKING. CAN'T. \n\n\"I shouldn't be forbidden from saying a phrase\"\n\nIT'S COMMON FUCKING COURTESY. Just be mindful of the goddamned problems other people have! It's not incredibly difficult - just please, oh please, don't ask me why I feel the way I do. If I knew that, I WOULDN'T HAVE ANXIETY. \n\nHow do you get it through these people's thick fucking skulls that I really don't like to be reminded of my problems by being told what my problems are and how \"easy\" they are to fix. \n\n ",

            "selftext": "Hello everyone, I know that some of us with anxiety have developed a condition called \"air hunger\" the feeling of not being able to get a satisfying breath. I suffered from this for many months and had several medical tests taken to rule out anything else, but i'm proud to say that I have reversed this condition and I would love to share on how I did it.\n\n\nLong story short, the reason why you feel air hunger is because your body has low carbon dioxide levels as a result of stress. When under stress, you breathe in more air and exhale a greater amount of carbon dioxide. This creates a viscous cycle causing your body to inhale more and more deeply to maintain the carbon dioxide level. If you continue to do this over a prolonged period of time, then your body deems your increased breathing volume as \"normal\" and as a result you will constantly feel short of breath unless you keep taking in big breaths.\n\n\nYour goal is to break this habit and restore your oxygen/carbon dioxide levels back to a healthier level. You can do this by practicing the Buteyko method. Dr. Buteyko spent decades researching how our breathing affects the body. There is a lot of info to follow so I left a link at the bottom of this post, but the goal is to reduce your breathing volume by practicing simple exercises. One thing to remember is that you should be breathing through your nose and into your belly. Mouth and chest breathing is a bad habit that many people don't realize.\n\n\nThe following is a simple way to measure your carbon dioxide level:  Also called the Control Pause technique.\n\n\nStep 1: Take a few small breaths and try to relax your breathing. Make sure to have a stopwatch handy.\n\nStep 2: Slowly exhale completely and once you have done so, hold your breath and start the timer.\n\nStep 3: Stop the timer when you feel the first urge to breathe, remember this is not a test of how long you can hold your breath, if you find yourself gasping for air then you held it for too long.\n\nStep 4: Record how long you held it for before needing to breathe, this is your Control Pause score. \n\n\n\n\nIf your CP is below 10 seconds then you are breathing several times over the regular amount. 10-20 means you're breathing over double the regular amount. Your goal is to consistently hit 30 or higher. A higher score means your body is more oxygenated and is not deprived of carbon dioxide.\n\nNext up is a technique to restore your carbon dioxide levels. While sitting, place your finger horizontally under your nose. Do your best to breathe only through the opening of your nose for 5 minutes. This will help you increase your carbon dioxide level. Now repeat the Control Pause Technique.\n\nRepeat this three times in sequence and do it twice a day. Keep a journal of your progress.\n\nI encourage anyone suffering from air hunger to check out this website and give it a thorough read. This is going to take a lot of dedication, but once your reach the finish line you will be much stronger person that ever before. Several people already have messaged me about their great results!\n\n\nPlease search Buteyko method on Youtube and you will find a lot of valuable information.\n\nLink to website: http://www.normalbreathing.com/buteyko-method.php\n\nLink to book: http://www.amazon.com/Anxiety-Free-Featuring-Breathing-Mindfulness/dp/0954599640/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1368231690&amp;sr=8-3&amp;keywords=buteyko\n",
