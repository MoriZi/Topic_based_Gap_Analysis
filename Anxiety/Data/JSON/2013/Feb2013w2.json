I felt myself withdraw into myself, until I could hear what was going on, but it seemed far away like I was under water. People would laugh or react in other ways around me but I didn't feel connected to them at all. I felt safe in my mental place, but I didn't feel it was probably healthy. Yet it kept me from crying or yelling, which would have been bad in this situation, as I had to keep my feelings to myself. Has anyone else experienced this? Am I right to think this was a bad thing? How do you deal with an authority figure you can't stand up to without digging yourself into a hole or making your anxiety worse?\n\nEdit: You guys are giving me a lot to think about. Thank you. Also, I didn't even think that this was a type of panic attack but I think it was. I had nightmares last night like I usually do after a panic attack when I don't run or somehow burn off the cortisol or whatever it is afterward. ",

            "selftext": "So for the passed 4 months I've been feeling so low. No energy, no motivation and no pleasure or joy in much of anything. Just recently I made my reddit account and I browsed through all the subreddits where I thought maybe, just maybe I could connect or at least find people who understand. Well, I found /r/progresspics and was amazed at the life changing decisions that these people made to change not just their whole body image but their overall health and many of their written testimonies were eye opening for me. So many of them felt how I felt.. not just about their health but about the world in general but they made a decision. A difficult but necessary decision to change what they could. Through /r/progresspics I then found /r/Keto have been on the Keto diet for a few days and chose today to do my first workout in forever, although I'm sore and know I'm probably going to be even more sore tomorrow, it feels good to take steps forward than to stand still.\n\nMany things in life are out of my control, but the one thing I do have control over is how I care for myself and my body. I must say.. even though today is my first time working out in a year or so, I have not felt this alive in so long and I feel great. I want to share this with /r/anxiety and will cross post to /r/depression as well because it wasn't that long ago when I felt that I was a waste of space and I didn't belong here anymore. I felt like I no longer wanted to exist.. and now I am looking forward to meeting goals, and that in itself is a goal met. \n\nAnybody out there that has felt alone, empty, lonely and felt completely hopeless... please know, you're not alone (there are genuinely good people out there that want and possibly need your friendship) if you're reading this and have any opinion on it what-so-ever you are not empty, loneliness is fleeting and so is hopelessness, when you feel you're very lowest, there is only one way to go and that is up. Find strength from within and push forward. Thanks for letting me share this and of you've read this, please try your best to take a step forward.. to make a change.",

            "selftext": "Hi, I am a 22 year old female who has learned to control my anxiety. After stumbling upon this subreddit, I really want to share how I was able to get myself under control so that I could live normally again. I really feel for all of those who are struggling and want to help in any way I can. These are the three things that have helped me:\n1. I first stumbled upon anxiety when I was 17. I had constant panic attacks, got no sleep, couldn't go to school, my life was falling apart. This stemmed from my friends thinking I would be crazy, the sudden panic of finding a perfect college and being forced to figure out what I wanted to do for the rest of my life, moving away from home, and death. I had heard medications could help me but as a healthy, active 17 year old athlete, I hated the idea of medication. My mother had convinced me to talk to a doctor, that he wouldn't force me to do anything I didn't to do. This was my first step. I talked to the doctor and of course he suggested medicating me. Is this addictive? can I stop using it whenever I want? Is this going to affect me mentally? These were all the questions I had and they were answered; no, certain medications are not addictive, I can stop, and it won't do anything to me mentally besides halt my anxiety. He told me to try a sample, if I didn't like it, I could stop but just take it for three days. Three days later I felt great. A new person, waves of anxiety stopped, I could interact again.\n2. Although my medication helped me with the sudden random panic attacks and constant anxious feeling, certain topics would still stress me out and flare my anxiety up. One of these topics was death: I had just put it in the back of my mind to deal with later but that only made it amplify. While in college I had to fulfill some core class requirements one of which was diversity. I took a religions class for this just because it sounded somewhat interesting (and I did get made fun of by some friends, but whatever, right?). I didn't meant to take anything from that class, but learning about buddhism, daoism, and others of the like, my entire perspective of life began to change. I took another class focusing on asian religions where we read books by these people (Diamond Sutre and Wandering the way most notable) and I was able to grasp a firm, spiritual control of myself and learned to control my body. This calmed me down greatly and I no longer have any concerns with death.\n3. School still stressed me the hell out: I was a junior, trying to graduate in one of the hardest majors. I like free credits, we have physical activity courses that give you this so I thought what the hell, took yoga and pilates. I gained more from these than I thought possible; learning awareness of your body really helps you deal with stress. I personally enjoyed pilates more (it is very strong with breathing exercise and gives you the best ab workout ever) but they both dealt with the idea of your body being only yours. I learned many destressing techniques and it was a great release for end of day classes with midterm exams. I learned to control my heart rate, close my eyes, and just release my stress and live in the here and now when I get too stressed out. I do this when I feel a stress induced panic attack coming on. Buddhism texts may have helped me a bit with this, but I really realized myself through these silly classes and have been going strong ever since.\nI did have full support from both of my parents this entire time and I never did have to see a psychologist for this. But I found my way through this difficulty and realize that living with anxiety isn't something I can just throw away, you have to learn to live with it and control it. Humans are facing far more stress in this new technological age (with having to stress about decisions for college, making decisions that effect the rest of your life, job ops, etc.) and we didn't all adapt to deal with this properly. Its nothing you need to feel too hindered by and remember there are always people trying to overcome it :) Don't feel afraid to ask for help!\n\nI would like to note: Almost no one knows about my anxiety. I tell no one that I have a strong spiritual side (because that sounds a bit silly) and I never really encourage it unless someone has problems with anxiety. People know that I am a little athletic, but I have it so under control that people ask me \"Don't you ever get nervous in a large crowd like this? You are really outgoing\" I just smile :) I just didn't want to sound like a religious nut! ~",

It is not even about anxiety, it is about practicing....whatever. It is an instruction manual on how to practice.\n\nI ended up getting the audio version. The speaker has a very soothing calm voice. I also played it at half-speed and it was even more relaxing.\n\nInspired, I applied the principles to both my study and weight lifting. I found that being slow and focused only on what I was doing became easier as I practiced practicing. I then found it gave my relaxation and joy (no kidding).\n\nNow for several months I have not have panic attacks. No chest pains. I feel rather great.\n\nI know this sounds very woo-woo. I am a skeptic, it's just how I operate, but this method worked for me. I hope that this works for someone else out there too.\n\n ",

            "selftext": "I was taking heavy rail transit today (has both elevated tracks and underground), which always puts me on edge. As soon as I got on the train, I was overwhelmed by the feeling that something wasn't right. I tried to ignore it, though, because I always get those feelings whenever I take transit. \n\nAnyway, things were going fine until about 3 stops in. All of a sudden, the train stops and then starts going backwards in the wrong direction. Everyone on board is like, wtf? After a few minutes, the train completely stops on the elevated track. The driver tells us that we were routed onto the wrong track, need to head back to a particular station where the routing issue wil be resolved, and then go back in the right direction. \n\nI instantly feel short of breath, light-headed, tingly sensation all over, extremely hot, about to pass out. I knew I was going into panic mode, and the worst part was that I was alone with my five year old son. \n\nHere's what I did (may not work for everyone, but it did for me and maybe it can for you):\n\n- I took off all unnecessary layers (jacket, sweater, scarf)\n- I I grazed my hands and arms with nails lightly (for some reason this physical sensation helps; squeezing/releasing hands also helps sometimes)\n- I started intensely analyzing the most mundane thing I could think of (what's for dinner tonight--tacos--how long am I going to cook the meat, what am I going to put in it, hard shell of soft, etc)\n\n*this worked for about 5-10 minutes, then some lady started yelling and getting aggressive because she was frustrated that the train wasn't moving. At this point, I had to find another way to distract myself*\n\n- I started playing a game on my phone with as much focus and precision as a neurosurgeon \n- I put my hand slightly over my mouth so I could feel my breathing\n\nThankfully, the train started moving again (in the right direction) about five minutes later. So all in all, we were stuck on the tracks for about 15-20 minutes. Of course to me, it seemed more like an hour. \n\nI'm proud that I was able to keep it together but also scared of how close I got to losing my shit. Seriously, when the train first stopped, it took every ounce of strength in me not to bolt for the first car, start pounding on the driver's window, and scream at him to let me off the train. Either that or just hyperventilate and pass out/throw up.\n\nI made it through this horrible situation (anything having to do with transit is one of my main triggers), but I think I am going to consider keeping on hand an \"as needed\" pill like Xanax. \n\nAnyway, if this helps anyone in any minor way, it was worth sharing. Take care everyone. ",
