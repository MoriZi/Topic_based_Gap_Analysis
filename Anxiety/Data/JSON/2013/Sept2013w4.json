My dad told me ''Right now, you have a higher chance of dying by not exercising rather than exercising''.\n\nSo I went out, and jogged for 5 minutes. That's freaking right, 5 minutes, without freaking out. It is so little compared to what I did in high school, but I feel proud.

There's been a bunch of stuff building up to it, and I hadn't really left the house in a few days so I suppose driving thirty minutes to the \"city\" by myself probably wasn't the best idea. But anyhow, as it was happening in a mall, my first instinct (besides trying to call somone to talk me through it) was to hit up the food court. I hadn't/haven't been eating much, and usually eating a bit helps calm me down during an attack.\n\nAs I picked through the teriyaki I managed to make myself chuckle with the idea of having \"emergency teriyaki\" on hand for these occaisions. Like, if I had a Batman-style anxiety utility belt, one of the pouches would be a big fanny-pack sized thing of vegetable stir fry.",

            "selftext": "I've always had a lot of anxiety where driving is concerned.  High speeds make me uncomfortable.  Other cars scare me.  Switching lanes is scary.  Making left turns doubly so.  My heart just starts hammering in my chest and I start seeing every little thing that can go wrong.  The anxiety is enough that I avoid driving whenever possible, but not so much that I can't make a trip down to the store along familiar roads.  I got my license when I was 18 (I'm 26 now) and have never needed to own a car or drive one regularly, so I didn't deal with this anxiety too often.\n\nUntil a couple of months ago.  \n\nIn July I started working as a nanny, and a part of my job is taking the kids to their activities.  Everything is close by and I was finally feeling comfortable driving (enough so that I made two 200mile round trips to drop off (and pick up) the kids at their moms.  That's 800 miles in three days!).  Anxiety was less.  Highways were no longer intimidating.  I was comfortable switching lanes and making left turns.  I was even thinking about getting my own car (or a scooter).  All was going really well.  \n\nAnd then I got into a [car accident](http://imgur.com/a/fagYl) last Thursday.  I was going straight under a yellow light (about 50mph) when an on coming minivan took a left.  I hit the brakes but not fast enough - I slammed into her car, which then flipped over.  Had it not been for the seat belts, I would've flown through the window and may not have survived.  But luckily, all I have is a shit ton of bruises and some chest pain (doctor said all is well).  \n\nI have training today at noon (for a different job), about a half hour away.  It's all highway to get there.  And I'm freaking out.  I really don't want to drive but I know I have to.  I can't let this stop me.  My girlfriend dropped me off at work this morning and I had a small melt down in the car.  I was *just* getting comfortable driving and then this happened.\n\nI know I'll have to just suck it up and drive.  I have no other choice.  But what can I do to minimize the anxiety while I'm driving?  To feel calmer and safer behind the wheel.  To prevent my head from seeing a potential car crash in any situation?\n\nLuckily, this is a route I've taken before.  But the car accident was less than two minutes away, but it still happened.\n\nJust in case: I'm not on any meds (aside from some pain killers for now) and I've never been diagnosed with anxiety problems of any kind.  This is pretty much the only thing that ever gives me any anxiety - everything else in life I tackle with a zeal.  But this is so debilitating! \n\n**TL;DR**: I've had driving anxiety for the 8 years I've had my license.  I was finally getting over it when I got into a bad car accident.  Anxiety is back with a vengeance.  Help!",

I've never been formally diagnosed because I'm distrusting - but particularly so of medical professionals. After an especially miserable period however I felt I had to contact my doctor. I did, I begrudgingly left the house, weaved through what felt like thousands of prying eyes and ended up with a prescription of Zoloft at 50mg/day.\n\nI've been told that it can take weeks to kick in, but after reading some reviews and experiences online I'm not even sure I *want* it to kick in. The side effects sound horrific. I'm really concerned about the idea of a drug with the benefits of a similarly administered placebo (as many reviews have put it) when it seems like its side effects can ruin lives - particularly when coming off of it. \n\nI have a phone call with my doctor scheduled for next week, and I'm already considering expressing concern about this. Does anyone have distinctly positive experiences with Zoloft - and if so, could you describe it? Particularly if your situation is similar to mine I'd like to hear about it, because I feel like I'm wasting my time with this drug and it's only going to make my circumstances worse. And I suspect that that negativity is only going to compound the issue. \n\nI considered posting this to /r/offmychest because that's what half of my motivation is here. I haven't even told anyone about the Zoloft or where I was when I was at the appointment because I don't want anyone to worry - and it's been a week now so it already feels like it's too late to come clean. \n\nThanks, people.

Normally it is 4/40 people.  \n\nAnd it is the weirdest thing, I can't make eye contact.  I try to hide if I am around.\n\nIt depends on the person.  Normally attractive strangers, I can avoid contact long enough, that I may never see that person again.

In some respects, it is narcissistic, why would they be bothered with me anyway.\n\nMe, I guess I am average build, weight, etc.  I guess living in larger major cities and seeing the wealthy, beautiful people when I grew up, maybe gave me this anxiety, I don't know.  And then my parents are top people (sort of politicians) as well.  And I am not, maybe my upbringing had something to do with it.\n\nSometimes I feel like a robot that is shutting down.  I see an attractive person coming my way.  I try to avoid that person but I can't.  I try to look normal but I don't know how.  I look at my shoes or pull out my phone.  Crap, I don't have my phone.  What do I do, look normal.  I am adult.  At this point, I just sweat and try to avoid a pending panic attack.\n\n* Has anyone experienced this?\n* What have you done to counter the effects?\n* For me, I guess it could be because I spend a lot of time alone.  Maybe I am just not used to people.\n* Oh yea, this perpetual summer sucks.  Gorgeous women in sun dresses everywhere.\n* And there are only two genders and unless you live in the sticks.   Most people are attractive to a degree.  So I just end up avoiding most people.\n\nI literally calculate the numbers in my head.  If I am 6(or 7), I am comfortable around other 6s or 5s.

            "selftext": "I have two questions that I\u2019d love to hear feedback on:\n\n1)\tDoes anybody else deal with anxiety around the risks associated with sex (pregnancy and STDs) and if so, how have you dealt with it? and\n\n2)\tWhat do you guys think about asking someone, before you sleep with them, if they have any STDs? Is that the behavior of an overly paranoid/anxious person, or just a careful person?\n\nAs things started getting serious with my last girlfriend, I got very nervous about the risks involved in having sex. I tend to be very anxious about risks/dangers I can\u2019t completely dismiss with 100% certainty, and the fact is that if you\u2019re having sex it carries some degree of risk for these things. Most rational people just acknowledge that as long as it is protected and they aren't being promiscuous then the level of risk is low and an acceptable trade-off for having a sex life. These are the things I remind myself, but as I\u2019m in what could potentially be the early stages of a new relationship I find myself feeling anxious about it again.\n\nThe kicker is that usually my therapist helps talk sense to me with this type of stuff, but this time I left more worried than I was when I came in. He supported what I said above (take the necessary precautions, identify the risk as low if you\u2019re safe, and don\u2019t get worked up about it) but he also suggested that I actually ask a potential partner if they have any STDs I should know about before we do anything. While I\u2019m all about being safe and thorough, I feel like in reality this is 1) not something that is easy to do and 2) not something I think anybody I know (including smart/safe/mature people) would suggest I do.\n\nUsually I get anxiety over something and I fear that it\u2019s a big danger and risk, and my time with my therapist helps me understand I\u2019m being irrational. But in this case I feel like he verified my concerns rather than dispelled them and suggested I should do even more than I have in the past to be careful. This, of course, has me more worried. Ironically my concern is usually much more about pregnancy, but after this discussion I\u2019m kind of focusing on this.\n\nAny suggestions people can offer for dealing with this type of anxiety, insight on asking such a potentially-awkward/upsetting question, or just how you deal with all of this while having a sex life would be most appreciated. Thanks everybody!\n",

            "selftext": "I need to vent about something if that's alright with you. Obviously, you don't need to read this.\n\nSo lets start off by saying that I am 21 years old and I've been dealing with panic attacks for about two years now. I don't take medication, I only went to three psych sessions, and I can barely control them when they do occur. \n\nTonight, I had a major assignment due at 11:59pm. Normally I would have had an assignment like this done days ago, but with the amount of homework and papers I had due this weekend, I had no choice but to wait until the final evening to complete this. So 8:00 rolls around and I have one essay left to write out of six. I take a 10 minute break and then a panic attack hits me. This one lasts about an hour and then another hits at around 9:50 or so. I couldn't focus, I couldn't breathe, I couldn't do anything. Time was running out to submit my essays, so I did something I didn't want to do. I called my dad and told him what was happening and asked him to help me with the final essay question. When he finished it, he emailed it to me and I put that right along with my other answers. I was relieved in a sense that my paper was done, but I felt guilty. \n\nI uploaded my assignment to safe assign and then boom, nearly everything my dad wrote for that question was either directly copied or the words were minimally changed. So basically, I am fucked. I deserve this for trying to get away with cheating, but fuck, I'm so sick of panic attacks getting in the way of everything. \n\nI'm most likely going to have academic sanctions put on me, I'll probably get a zero on the MAJOR assignment, I may even get suspended. It hasn't been graded yet, so I don't even know if he will notice, but I'm sure he will. I don't know what to do. Do I tell him why that happened? Do I wait and see if he says something? Do I try to lie about it by saying I accidentally copied my rough draft into my final? I just don't know what to do. \n\nLiterally all the motivation that I had is completely gone. I don't even want to think about anything related to school, like homework that is due tomorrow, because I am so stressed. ",

            "selftext": "Earlier this morning, I heard a commotion of what sounded like furniture being toppled over and people screaming at each, impacting noises and what was either a child or infant crying loudly in all of it. This stressed me the hell out to the point where I went downstairs to the apartment office to get a security officer to examine the situation. Unfortunately, when we got to my floor, the noise had died down.\n\nStill, he told me to call the cops in case it does happen again. Thinking it was just a one-time spat, I let it slide, until the same commotion happened again half an hour so later. At this point, I called 911 and asked for a police officer to resolve a potential domestic disturbance on my floor. 10 minutes or so later, two of them arrived, asked questions and I answered them as best as I could (they asked if I was OK because they could tell I was having a minor freakout).\n\nAgain, when they arrived the noise had died down, but just as they were about to leave, it started happening again, though only briefly. They couldn't determine what room it was, so they basically just listened in on rooms on that floor to see which room had the disturbance. After they left, the noise came up AGAIN, which ended in me calling the cops AGAIN. This time they sent 4 cops instead of the other 2, and they instantly heard the noise as soon as they arrived on my floor. I'm assuming they've resolved it because up to this point I haven't heard any commotion.\n\nMy heart can't stop beating, I've never had to deal with both a domestic disturbance this violent and having to call the cops before. Since the disturbance, any loud noise I hear, whether inside or outside my room, freaks me out and gets my adrenaline going again. Can someone help calm me down so I don't jump at every little sound?",

I was basically afraid of any confrontation of anything.\n\nAlmost 2 months ago a great job oppurtunity came up. I was offered a job interview in a place i'd wanted to work for years. It was the perfect job for me (customer service adviser in a call center, but this is what I really wanted to do). I was worried as hell about the job interview but I knew I needed to make this my number 1 priority.\nI went to the job interview and it went smoothly. I few days later I received a call to say i'd got the job.\n\nI started the job on the first day with so much anxiety. I walked in and sat down... I was like a lost puppy in a strange room. I didn't start on my own, there were 2 other lads and a girl also starting with me. We were took on a tour of the unit (it's connected to 2 large warehouses, many offices and 2 large call centers, bathroom customer service and kitchen customer service (I work at the UK's largest supplier of kitchens and bathrooms). I tried to be as confident as I could when being introduced. When we were shown around the warehouses, I was asking question after question, this is something I would usually have avoided but I knew I had to get past the anxiety if I wanted to succeed as this job.\n\nAfter the tour, we were introduced to our 1-on-1 trainers. My trainer was a very nice 50 something woman who treated me so nice and made me feel very welcome. I sat with her for 2 weeks and her inner beauty helped me to feel compfertable and try to fit in well.\n\nEventually I was on the phones myself, on a desk all on my own. I nailed it!!! It's been 7 weeks now and I feel like my anxiety is almost gone!! I feel amazing!! I can talk to strangers and not worry about what I say to people after i've said it like I used to.\n\nI still get little anxiety now and again but it's slowly fading. I feel like a new person and I want to thank **everyone** on reddit, especially /r/anxiety and /r/socialanxiety !! Reading other posts alone was enough to help me, but when I posted I felt compfertable most of the time and the responces were fast and extremely helpful, so thank you.\n\nI hope all of you can feel the way I do now. The way I was before was ruining my life - I wouldn't wish it on my worst enemy! I feel like i'm a new man facing the world in a different, much more positive way :)",

My doctor gave me some clonazepam which helped a lot but I was becomming dependant on Them quickly so my doctor wanted to switch me to SSRIs. I had no interest in being on drugs for the foreseeable future so I began to look for other options. (no offence to anyone, i was just scared of the side effects)\n\nI discovered magnesium. I have seen countless people online reporting that taking magnesium supplements cured their anxiety. I am now one of those people as well: my anxiety levels are lower than on clonazepam and getting better every day.\n\nAnxiety is one of the first symptoms to appear with magnesium deficiency. Many of the other weird symptoms of anxiety such as weak hands and cold hands and feet are explained by magnesium deficiency.\nThe kind that works best for me is magnesium citrate powder. It works within 5 minutes to eliminate anxiety, relax muscles, and improve my breathing (i have asthma). My sleeping has vastly improved as well, my heart rate is lower and doesn't race anymore and i no longer get heart palpitations. Magnesium chloride and magnesium malate are effective as well. Try to avoid magnesium oxide as it is the cheapest and most common but is not absorbed by the  body as well for whatever reason.\n\nTake small amounts to avoid any unpleasant digestive symptoms",
