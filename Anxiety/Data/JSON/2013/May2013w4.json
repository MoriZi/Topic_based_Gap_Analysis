Please feel free to forward on the survey link, the higher the amount of responses and the more varied the participants the more robust my research findings will be. Also please complete the full survey once you have started or the information will be lost!\nAgain, many thanks.\nNick.",

            "selftext": "I just found this subreddit and really regret not looking earlier, but something amazing happened today and even though you're all strangers, I know you can relate and I need to share it.\n\nI've been dealing with anxiety for just over 5 years now. Pretty much restricted to health anxiety and panic attacks about dying suddenly. It has been getting a lot better in the last couple years but every time I have a panic attack it feels like I'll never get better. But today showed me that not only is it possible, it's happening.\n\nI had a tooth extracted today. I was very nervous about it, about the procedure for sure, but mostly for the aftercare. Taking a new medication has always been a massive trigger for me, especially ones that have noticeable effects. And I knew I would need and be prescribed Tylenol 3s. Last time I took them (also dental I think) I had a massive panic attack and probably ended up at the emergency room feeling like an idiot as usual. [I live alone and everyone I love lives almost 5000km away so my panic attacks would generally end up in the ER since I have no one else to calm me down).\n\nSo this morning the extraction went way better than they expected. Took only a few minutes and didn't need to cut my gums or anything. I decided not to take a Clonazepam (I take as needed and very rarely now) and try to tough it out. It was tough, but when it finished so quickly I was so relieved. Then I was off to the pharmacy for those dreaded Tylenol 3s...\n\nIt's now almost 10 hours later and I have NOT had a panic attack. I have just been chilling on the couch all day, watching tv and playing videogames. There has been some minor anxiety when I take each pill but I've been able to brush it off and I am almost in disbelief. \n\nA big trigger for me is not feeling like myself which is why I stopped doing all drugs and am wary of new medication since I developed anxiety. This is the first time since that I've dealt with something like this as a normal person and not someone who thought she was going to be found in two weeks cold and dead on the floor. I definitely feel the effects of the tylenol 3s, but it isn't scaring me like I expected or like it used to.\n\nI don't even know what to say really. I feel like I passed through some important stage without really realizing it and now I can look back at my old self and all those hospital visits and know it can get better. I just needed to share this with someone. Thank you all so much for reading a stranger's revelation :)",

            "selftext": "Hey folks. I have physical anxiety. For the past few months it had been almost non-existent, but it's back in force again after a panic attack I had last week. My body is out of equilibrium, which has caused a lot of episodes of panic, as well as extreme fatigue, brain fog, wanting to cry my eyes out, etc. I've overcome this once before, though, without medications. In fact, I was prescribed Hydroxyzine today, took 5 mg and felt even more brain fog and nervousness. I snapped out of it, but the symptoms are still lingering. I feel compelled to share what helped me get through this last time, because this time I was too quick to jump to meds. \n\n-- Try to help solve someone else's problem: The worst times of anxiety are when you feel like you can't escape your own head. The entire universe feels like it exists between your ears--that's the number one way I'll describe it with people. If you have a friend you think is going through something, talk to them. Not only do you distract your brain from anxiety, but you also feel good and sharp. \n\n-- Do something creative: Graphic design was always my niche. Whenever I'm doodling my mind relaxes and focuses. Just like with talking to people, whenever you can do something highly functional with your own mind, you realize how much of it is still really there. Sometimes I'll do this for hours, and the results make me so proud that I get focused on that--not my anxiety.\n\n-- DO NOT GOOGLE YOUR SYMPTOMS: I cannot stress this enough. The first few things that will pop up on any google search are usually worst-case scenarios. When I first had anxiety I had neck and head pressure, scalp burning, vertigo, diziness, panic attacks, etc. The first thing that came up on Google search was some guy thinking he had some unknown disease...he let it ruin his life. Every. Symptom. I had. I freaked the fuck out. Turns out, these people are simply hypochondriacs who have failed to deal with their problems constructively. You can convince yourself of having anything if you try hard enough. Nothing is more reassuring than seeing a medical professional and having them simply smile at you sand say, \"You've got anxiety. It's tough, but it's not the end of the world. Stay calm.\" Whenever I feel compelled to google my symptoms I remind myself of how my doctors have shared laughs with me during discussions--reassuring that what I have is temporary and can be dealt with. \n\n-- Talk to yourself. Or be funny: I've been blessed with a pretty joking personality. A lot of times, if I'm driving and feeling anxious, I'll just start making really stupid, ambiguous noises. Ironic, because it would appear to the people on the outside that I'm losing my mind, but in the end it helps me remind myself I'm still here. \n\n-- Exercise: One of the best things I ever did was start a daily walk/jog up and down the mountain next to my house. Giving your body somewhere else to dispose of energy makes a huge difference!\n\n-- Eat right: Tuna, blue berries, bananas, non-fried chicken, rice, cereals and trail mix. Chocolate is actually decent too. Avoid excess caffeine. \n\n-- Whatever anyone says, don't drink or smoke: This may be controversial, but both of my bad anxiety episodes were sparked by substance abuse. First it was alcohol, then it was marijauna. Both caused panic attacks for me. \n\n-- Sleep schedule! \n\n-- Herbal tea: Kava seems to help my body relax at night. \n\n-- Sing: I do karaoke twice a week. When I do karaoke, my anxiety is gone. Singing is fun, and again helps get the mind out of the funky zone. \n\n-- Talk to friends about it. Get your anxiety in the open. Not being open about your anxiety can actually make you feel more stuck in your own head, which causes more stress. \n\n-- Remember, you're fine. There's a lot of people out there who have terminal diseases. Yours is not one of them.",

            "selftext": "My dad told me to try to write a list of things that stop me from getting out and functioning and doing important things like going to the doctor and going through the one by one. But the thought of making that list maeks me anxious so Ihaven't done it yet. \n\nIs there any other tips or anyone else there who has agoraphobia and trouble leaving there house? I'd love to hear from someone else as I can feel quite alone wich should be no surprise. \n\n\nEdit: Thanks for your replies. I have the full story of my life right here. Warning WALL OF TEXT! Just wanted to give some background. it's not very organized though but it's one of hte first time I was able to do this without getting upset recalling all the details. I was actually trying to get help but the help here is really shitty. I have PTSD because my parents sent me to the psychiatric ward and I got stuck in an abusive group home. Shit sucks. \n\nThanks. \n\nFor me it's not so much the idea of leaving the house, it's just I'm afraid of going out because I'm afraid of anxiety attacks. What's worse is that I have severe allergies brought on by a chronic sinus infection which feeds into my allergies. Even worse is that I'm (high functioning) autistic/aspergers so I have sensory integration problems, that I am using deep pressure input to prevent meltdowns, but it still feeds into agoraphobia. For example my front yard is not private. If things aren't private I just get uncomfortable. I have to shut all the doors in my house for this reason because it feels uncomfortable if door are left ajar. I always have my back to a wall and I can't sit infront of a door. My Doctor's office is cramped and has fluorescent lights and my glasses are too thick and I'm too blind to wear sunglasses so it all feeds into my agoraphobia.\n\nUnfortunately when I was about 15 (23 now) my anxiety problems climaxed because I was overprescribed medications. I had a nervous breakdown because I was hallucinating and got sent to psychiatric wards where I became traumatized. \n\n\n\nIn saying that I do physically leave my house once a week because of garbage day and I am trying to stick my head out the door or just chill on my porch more but the noise (Sensory problems, hypersensitive) and the fact my property just fucking sucks and it is not private makes me uncomfortable for non-agoraphobic reasons. When I was living at my parents house I was a lot more comfortable outside.\n\n2 years ago or longer I was getting help from someone at a home care agency to help me get out of the house more. We were driving at least 3 times a week and going to a coffee shop a few times a week and also doing a lot of errands. Unfortunately since I was working with a BMS who was less than adequate to say the least I felt like I was forced to live with the workers because she treated me like a low functioning autistic person who could not make decisions or my own or a child. She was the one who got me sent to a traumatic group home where I was literally almost killed and traumatized for 7 months and she didn't understand that I just wanted to relax and get used to my new apartment and living on my own before I started adding to it with school, hobbies and shit. She was truly really shitty at her job. The BMS quit and I still stuck with the home care workers but there was no plan in place. The BMS' job was to have a plan so I end up becoming independent and not agoraphobic. So what happened was that my independence actually lessoned because before that point I wanted to do things by myself and I was getting out by myself. I ended up with only 1 home care worker because out of 4 of them two were grossly undertrained, the most trained and senior worker was burnt out from drugs and permanently fried from when he was younger and would sleep on my couch everyday. The last worker I worked with really well but we didn't really accomplish everything besides going out every day. Which was nice but I relied on her too much and my independence vanished. \n\nI was also walking almost literally every day or every second day. hen my home care worker left. The sinus infection has been here for 2 years and my allergies have gone wild and prevents me from going outside. It feeds into agoraphobia because if I don't get allergies, which I'm not exagerrating I get everytime I go outside anyways, I'm afraid of it so even in winter I am afraid of going out for allergy reasons.  It sucks because I predicted this would happen with the home care worker and she didn't give me any time before she quit and it just really screwed me over.\n\nAround that time my therapist left even though I was telling her as much information as I am in this post about being agoraphobic. I told her I thought I had PTSD from the group homes and psychiatric hospitals and assault and attempted rapes and what not, but she wouldn't listen and we argued about it. Then she quit. \n\nChronic sinus infection happened and I became bedridden. My allergies have been absolutely haywire. I stopped walking everyday. I got fat which added to my sensory integration problems.(I'm sensitive to touch so it's really difficult to get used to different clothes and I need new clothes cause I'm a gained like 50 pounds.)  I stopped going out of the house and everything fed into my agoraphobiaAround this time was when my therapist quit. I realized my family doctors were shitty doctors and had to find anew one by the change was too hard to deal with so I haven't seen him much.  My home care worker quit working with me because she wanted a better job. It's been like this for at least 2 years now. Had a friend but he moved to Europe. \n\n\n\nI have a new family doctor now but I haven't been able to see him. I'm talking to my family at least a couple times a week and my friend on the phone literally everyday. He helps me out if I ever have flashbacks or meltdowns and I'm able to talk about anxiety and stuff with my parents. My parents help me get groceries since I don't go out now, but I understand so much about myself to know it's not going to help my anxiety. But at the same time talking to htem everyday is going to help me when I start going out to get groceries by myself and the doctor. So it's a start, but it feels like its' so slow since I'm so fucking sick all the time. I have a lot of health problems and I feel like I'm going ot die a lot. \n\n",

            "selftext": "Basically I'm schizophrenic, and while my psychiatrist and care worker will give me help and meds for the psychosis, they don't seem to care about the anxiety attacks that I experience daily, and everywhere.  Right now I'm thinking I'm being monitored by my neighbours so typing this is very embarassing, but screw it.  Every single day when I hear them come down the stairs of the building I feel like they're gonna break down the door and kill me (or at least beat me up and rob me).  I have a walking stick I have to use sometimes and I like having it near me, in case I need a weapon to defend myself.\n \nGoing outdoors is terrifying.  I'm better at doing it before, but it's actually getting harder and harder each time.  I have to prepare by meditating, again for longer and longer each time, and checking myself in several mirrors to make sure I'm not hallucinating that I've put clothes on and they're actually there, and my zipper is done up, and I even sometimes take photos of myself.  Then when I actually go outside I hear constant laughter, and I don't know whether that's a hallucination, or just misinterpreting real people's laughter, but it's like being paraded down the street as a huge laughing stock, and because I can never work out exactly why everybody is laughing and staring I get anxiety attacks and have to run into shops or bars to hide.  Whern walking past someone on the sidewalk I very often stumble because my legs tense up or something and get weak, and that's embarassing.  I can't urinate in public bathrooms anymore.  I used to be fine if I went in the stall but even that I can't do anymore cos I think people can see through the walls.  So I have to either be dehydrated or have a painful bladder.\n\nEvery single noise scares me when I'm in my apartment.  I can hear people laughing from the street outside and I'm convinced it's cos they can see inside my apartment, so I've been blocking up the windows with sheets of thick paper and making sure the curtains are fully closed, and it's pretty dark in here now but it helps a bit.  I'm constantly being observed and filmed wherever I am, which is pretty annoying. \n\nI've apparently been really really tense recently because I had to go to the emergency room for chest pains and tightness and uncontrollably fast breathing.  There's nothing wrong with my heart and they think it's chest muscle strain.  But every time I feel pain in my chest I get very worried it's a heart attack and I sometimes try not eating for a day or something so I have a lower chance of it, or something.\n\nI guess the point of this is do I need some kind of anti-anxiety medication, temporarily?  I'd rather not have more and more pills as I already take loads every day anyway, but they'd be better than drinking in the morning before I leave my apartment, which is the only thing that helps at the moment.  But my psychiatrist doesn't seem to care about it, or address it, and I've asked him directly about it.  I've never not had social anxiety to an extent, so it's a separate thing from the schizophrenia.  No anti-psychotic has ever got rid of my symptoms, just got rid of some of the anxiety from them, but I've never been good at going outside, sometimes going days without food because I run out and am too scared to buy any.\n\nI doubt anyone has read this far but if you have, thank you.  I needed to write this all down even if I didn't post it here, because it makes it easier somehow.  Of course I've had to type it with my wireless off so my neighbours can't access it, and then very quickly post it.  Of course they can still read my thoughts so that doesn't help much I guess.\n",
