            "selftext": "Just a rant and seeing if anyone else feels the same.  \n\nI'm so tired. Every social situation and every human interaction I have throughout my day, I overthink it. I'm a medical assistant for a pediatrician and I talk to 20+ people on the phone and encounter 20+ patients in a work day. Every single conversation I have with a patient, I think about how it went. I play the whole conversation out in my head. I say \"bye, have a nice day\" and in think things like \"Oh why did you say that thing, that was so weird they probably think you're creepy. And why did you make that joke? It wasn't funny. They may've laughed but they didn't find it funny. Ugh they probably hate you and think you're weird and stupid.\" And then repeat situation 19 more times. \n\nAnd then there's my boyfriend. I talk to him about my anxiety and he is very understanding and super helpful. He's the best and I am so blessed to have him in my life. We've been friends for many years and he always had a thing for me. I question myself everyday wondering why someone so amazing could love me. It boggles my mind that he loves me. It really does. I'm worried that every time I talk to him about my anxiety, he gets annoyed and hates dealing with me. I overthink my encounters with him. He gives me no reason to believe that he's tired of dealing with it. He's always reassuring and tells me he loves helping me feel better.  We've been together for a year and I've been working on my anxiety, which has greatly improved in other areas. It was much worse a year ago. He even reminds me that it's improved since we first got together, which it has but I still feel like there's more I want to work on. I think it all comes back to my confidence. If I was confident in myself and my abilities, I'd be able so say \"That conversation went well. You were perfectly pleasant and they liked you.\" And be done with it. I automatically assume the negative and think some total stranger is out there hating me right now because of the way I said something. \n\nAll in all, I have improved but I've only skimmed the surface. I want to conquer it. I want to overcome my negative thoughts and shut them down. I want to be confident. I want to say \"I'm good at this.\" \"I look beautiful today.\" I want to sleep. I want to go on with my day without worrying about what some stranger thinks of me. I want to go one day without replaying a single conversation in my head. I want to love myself. I wish I could see myself the way my boyfriend sees me. \n\nEdit: thank you all so much or your kind words and thoughts. They have all been very helpful. I wish you all the best of luck with our struggle and that we become the people we are truly meant to be; anxiety free. ",

I don't believe I have a disorder of any kind, but I am wasting a tremendous amount of energy worrying about worst possible outcomes of many different kinds. It's gotten to the point that I seem to be actively but subconsciously finding/discovering things to worry about, and I rationalize/justify it as being cautious, prudent, or responsible. \n\nI usually have very little reason to worry and an insignificant basis for each of my concerns, but I tell myself that \"some idiot who doesn't worry about or prepare for these outcomes just lives life by the seat of their pants and doesn't see a disaster coming until it arrives.\"\n\nBut, the reality is that none of my worrying actually prepares me for problems or prevents problems, and in all likelihood, it makes me indirectly less prepared for problems just by draining my energy and occupying my mind, which prevents untold amounts of higher-level cognition, creative thinking, or just good work and progress toward life goals.\n\nIn terms of physiology, I get occasional unpleasant experiences like adrenaline rushes (the bad kind), heart rate increases, and what I guess you'd call small waves of panic.\n\nI'd love to get out of this habit. I want to be someone who keeps their cool in a crisis, not someone who loses their cool in a total absence of any crisis.\n\nAny ideas?",

            "selftext": "For several years now I have been in a type of psychotherapy for anxiety, depression and pure obsessional ocd that uses Mindfulness that I have found extremely helpful. The more I use it the more results I get. \n\nRecently my therapist has been working with me to do a series of exposures to one of my big problems and although she kept adjusting the target to get it to a do-able point I just haven't been able to do it. She apologized to me, something no therapist has ever done to me before, for not coming up with way for me to work with this target. I am still shocked about the apology and I am very glad I have someone so focused on really helping me without her own ego being in the way. \n\nAfter discussion we decided to back off a bit and have me work more on daily triggers as they come up really cranking up the mindfulness of my own emotional reactions. It turns out after lots hard but worth it because it was effective work there is a lot of stuff I had been avoiding. Some are things that provoke only low level anxiety not much different than my usual baseline so I ignored it to focus on other targets. Others were bigger but it turns out that all these years I automatically blocked myself from being aware of them. The fear levels were medium to high so I would shift them away the moment I noticed them to cut down on how fearful and on the verge of panic they made me. The thoughts associated with those situations are like slippery eels slithering away as I try to catch the little nasty little b******s. It is been seriously hard work to get a hold of 'em long enough to expose myself to the thought/feeling so I could feel it until it wears itself out. \n\nI have kept at it because exposure helped me slowly but surely eliminate so many repetitive thoughts and their associated emotions that used to constantly fill my head which now feels empty by comparison. It's difficult and intense but it worked before so I grimly have kept at it. I am getting better at being aware of my own emotions beyond the usual general fear level with only peak high level fear stuff really registering (with some big things just zipping away).\n\nIt has been rigorous to try to be present longer and longer though out the day but in just the past month I have seen quite a difference in my awareness, how much I can hold before it escapes and how I am able to do into stronger and stronger emotions. It makes me very glad I am doing this. No wonder it was hard to do the big target when i had so much already going on inside of me unaware to myself taking up so much energy. Doing this will eventually reduce or eliminate the daily stuff crapping up my life and leave me with more practiced ability to confront the target properly. And I am finding out I am tougher than I realized and I am finally able to face more of the old feelings of shame and selfhatred I used to practice that has kept me from giving myself credit. I am tough to do this work. I am strong to have survived even when I did not really want to or believe I would even find anything to help me. I have dealt with this much and made progress so I can make at least a little - maybe even alot - more progress.\n\n\nedited to add this article which basically describes the kind of mindfulness I am doing. There are many ways do to Mindfulness such as focusing on the breath or a mantra and focusing on being present in whatever activity you are doing, gently redirecting one's mind to the focus every time it is caught wandering like a hyperactive monkey on illegal stimulants. well at least my mind has often been like what I imagine one of those would be. anyhow here is the article:\n\n\n* **Riding the \"E\" Train: Mindfulness of Emotions**\nhttp://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/urban-mindfulness/200904/riding-the-e-train-mindfulness-emotions\n\n* **Integrative Mindful Exposure \u2013 Emotional Surfing 1**\nhttp://www.mindfulexposurebook.com/integrative-mindful-exposure-emotional-surfing\n\nI maybe should add that I have carefully and most cautiously built up to the point I am at now having done a ton of work on being able to stay present without dissociating, learning to prevent most panic attacks, grounding exercises, body scan, abdominal breathing. I know when to stop doing something a good measure before when I am likely to trigger panic because 1. panic sucks, hurts, and in general highly unpleasant and 2. it makes it that much harder to do the activity again. I learned my early warning signs so I do'nt push to the point of likely triggering a panic unless it's something that must be done. In therapy it just makes me that much more relucant to do the work so better to dip my toe into the target pool instead of full immersion - or better yet start with the smallest shallowest pool and verrrrrrrry s l o w l y work up to the big ones and then dip my toe in for a few breaths testing the waters. Forcing myself too far and fast just reinforces the fear. Going slow lets me nibble away at the target. In the end it does not take longer than going for the juglar because the other method isn't doable for me so it wouldn't get done :o",

This last year has been the worst so within the last few months I started therapy and got Xanax.\n\nI was reluctant for awhile to take any Xanax because of the addiction/dependency potential. But a few days ago I took it for the first time cause I wanted to be comfortable taking it in case I really need it.\n\nAnyways, I took it (.5) and was pretty surprised. I was expecting it to be a lot more intense but it just gradually came on and was very relaxing.\n\nEver since then I haven't taken anymore. This was 2-3 days ago. I still feel not anxious and overall pretty calm.\n\nJust wondering if anyone else here had similar experiences? I'm not saying this is some one time deal miracle drug. Because I'm not expecting for this to last forever. But I was thinking if I was able to take it just a few times a month it would keep me balanced.\n\nJust thought I'd share!",
