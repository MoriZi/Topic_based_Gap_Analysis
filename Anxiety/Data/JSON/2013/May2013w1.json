            "selftext": "I definitely had abnormally high anxiety since I was a young child. I was bullied and my parents put very high demands on me to do well so that wouldn't have helped. When I was about 16 I became depressed and eventually overcame it, by overcoming my anxiety.\n\nA lot of people reading this probably have more severe anxiety, I was pretty typical GAD sufferer:\n\n- I feared social interaction. I remember my heart used to race just from talking in online games let alone real life.\n\n- I feared being around people. I couldn't cough in crowded rooms, use public restrooms, make eye contact and during the bad times my legs would buckle while walking if I knew people where watching me, so sometimes I would get stuck.\n\n- Never danced or sung in my life or even tried. Stays completely still during rock concerts.\n\n- Failed almost every oral presentation due to not doing it.\n\n- No sports, no girlfriends, only a few really really nice understanding friends.\n\n- Finally, fear of failure so strong you don't try leading you to fail at life bringing on depression. Lose job, fail out of uni, family asks you to move out etc.\n\nI overcame most of these by joining a martial art, I don't know how else to say it really, I was forced to go to a martial art dojo. The first few times I was absolutely shitting myself as I had to move! and sometime they made noises! but I was lucky in that I was forced to go. After about a month I did my first grading and was once again shitting myself as everyone was watching me but I had this weird sense of confidence, knowing I had the full support of my peers and many hours of training, I knew I could do it and I did!\n\nFast forward 12 months and I have so much more confidence in myself. My posture is better, I'm more fit, I'm more friendly, I'm better at talking to people, I stopped playing video games and watching TV, I went on a few dates (which again where a huge challenge).\n\nI'm still about 100 000 miles from where I want to be, but I don't fear the dark any more. Everybody is different but maybe seeing a factual case of someone actually becoming less anxious will give you hope that it can happen.\n\nThese days I'm probably only as nervous as a normal person, public speaking, talking to pretty girls and dancing are probably my biggest fears still, but I feel completely liberated, I'm free from my own mind and I plan to be the least anxious mother fucker in the universe.\n\n**TLDR** I faced my fears in very small incremental steps in a warm, friendly environment that I was forced to go to and it made me less anxious in life",

(bridges, freeways, and one underpass close to where i live) Well I'm 18 and still haven't learned to drive so my dad has been pushing me to go out and drive. I generally have an attack when we first start driving. My dad understands I have issues with driving so he hasn't really pushed me to do any of the things that really freak me out. \n\nWell today after half an hour or so, I needed to get into the center of town. There are three ways to do that. One, get on the freeway which I refuse to do right now, two is to go along a truck rout and that takes about five or more minutes longer, and third is to go through a very tight and small underpass. As we were about to turn to get onto the truck rout, I said screw it and went straight to the underpass. Now mind you, I was gripping the wheel with white knuckles and my dad was just as shocked as me. I never push myself so I have no idea why I chose to face one of my fears today. \n\nI was scared as all get out and the few seconds I was in there felt like forever but I am glad I did it. After I did it we stopped at a gas station so I could get out and breath. \n\nI thought you all would like my little story and maybe it can help, I don't know. That underpass still scares me but I know I have to try and face my fears if I ever want to live a semi normal life. ",

I wanted to make a post that will hopefully help a few people through their conditions. I will try to be brief and get to the point, so i'll provide a short backstory and then get to what cured me.\n\nBackstory: I started getting panic attacks at around 18, which lead to quite crippling GAD and then SAD. At my worst I was unable to leave the house for more than short periods of time. I had dozens of panic attacks daily, could barely interact with anyone but family, and was underemployed for many years. I tried dozens of medications for the first couple years, but nothing really treated me effectively, and many made things worse. I suffered immensely until I was 24.\n\nI started seeing a therapist, who insisted that I had some deep seated trauma in my childhood causing my anxiety. Like probably most of you, there was nothing apparent causing my anxiety. It just happens to some people with no specific cause. My therapist kept digging for something, and I kept wasting money and saw no progress.\n\nTherapy was a bust and I was completely hopeless. What changed my life was a book: Feeling Good by David Burns. It introduced me to the concept of Cognitive Behavioral Therapy.\n\nI quickly realized that knowledge is power. I read about a dozen books about CBT, learned everything I could about anxiety and depression (namely, that negative thoughts are the root of the issue) and worked persistently through it all.\n\nI spent about a year doing daily CBT exercises that I found in various books and on the internet. I LIVED this stuff. Every time I had a negative thought, I plucked it out and rationalized it. Told myself over and over that these thoughts were wrong and that I need to break the bullshit habit of irrational thought.\n\nAfter maybe 6 months of CBT, I felt significant improvement. After a solid year, I was probably 75% cured. 6 years later, today, I can honestly say it's 95% gone. I've had maybe two panic attacks since, and I was able to talk myself through them so easily, they didn't last more than 2 minutes.\n\nI'm now confident, successful, employed in a fantastic job and live independently. I didn't turn into the life of the party; I still need to work at social interaction, but I barely flinch at things that used to send me into a panic attack just thinking about.\n\nI'm happy to answer any questions or provide details for anyone that needs it. I'm not suggesting that CBT will work for everyone and that medications are useless (they are extremely beneficial in certain situations) but I want to share my story in hopes that some people will benefit.",

Regardless of what we discuss we all need to quit, I just find it so difficult and I'm sure many do. The reason is because being a smoker allows you easy escape from situations without it being too abrupt. The simple line of \"I'm gonna go smoke a cigarette\" can get you out of any situation. But with the smoking comes the health anxiety, at least in my case. I am constantly worrying about health problems caused by smoking cigarettes. I am only 23 years old and have only been smoking for 2 and a half years, but it's time to quit while Im ahead and it's time to take more control of anxiety and panic.\n\n I wanna hear your stories. Anybody successfully quit? How'd you go about it? What other ways do you manage your anxiety without the smokes? Anybody still a smoker and wanting to quit?",

My thoughts sort of transitioned from \"This guy is making me nervous\" to \"This guy is a dick\" to \"This guy is acting like a child.\" When I got to that final thought, I realized that I could firmly tell him there was nothing I could do about the price.

            "selftext": "21F\n\nI grew up in a super conservative family. They didn't really encourage social interaction because we have such a large, religious, conservative family, it was difficult to keep track of all the kids and make sure they were hanging around \"good types.\"  It was just easier to keep us at home. \n\nNow I'm in college.  I'm no longer religious, I'm not particularly conservative, and I feel like I've missed out on a lot in life.  The first party I ever went to was like, 5 weeks ago.  \n\nI've always told myself that I just must be an introvert.  I don't enjoy social settings because I'm an introvert.  But in the past couple years of being at college and away from my family - who were, by and large, the only people I had any significant amount of social interaction with - I've found myself in a cycle of down-ward-spiraling depression and desperate attempts on my part to claw my way back up out of it. \n\nAnd it just occurred to me.  What if I'm not an introvert? When I'm around people that I'm comfortable with (Like my roomates, who I am now only somewhat comfortable with after living with them for over a year), I'm actually really talkative and sociable. I'm actually really funny and tend to be the loud, showy one when I'm near people I am comfortable with.  What if I'm actually an extrovert, I just don't know how to be one? Since I've been living the life of a shut-in introvert my whole life, I don't know how to be what my personality is.  And this whole dilemma is just a huge pain in the ass.  \n\nMy first two years at college, I felt overwhelmed by choosing my career path and I was, at the same time, in the process of discovering my social/religious/political belief systems. All of this was thrown on the backburner because I couldn't develop friendships and constantly felt alone.  And then, while being alone, I *just knew* it *had* to be because there's something wrong or unlikeable about me. So my confidence really took a hit, but it was never very high in the first place.  \n\nFor the past year or so I've been trying to \"fake it 'til you make it\" when it comes to confidence.  and I've made strides.  I am, in general, a happier and more positive person than I was before.  I am in a better place.  But I still struggle with social anxiety. I still struggle with being the extroverted person I know I am.\n\nLast night, for example.  I had a great opportunity to spend time with some very friendly adults who work in the music industry. It was a great opportunity for me, since I'm just so curious about their work and their lifestyle.  Even though this was such a great night for me, I found myself freezing up with social anxiety. I started to get stomach pains over it.  They could sense I was struggling, I think, and were even kinder. They tried to insert me into the conversations, but didn't pressure me into speaking if I didn't feel up to it.  In the end, I felt torn - one part social anxiety, another part shame for not being able to stand on my own social feet in such an easy situation, and another part happiness that there exists such understanding people.  \n\nOn the rare occassions that I do find people I connect with *fairly* easily, I feel that I suffocate them.  I find that I am so happy to finally have someone that I feel comfortable and happy around, that I want to be around them *all the time* and sometimes get pouty, depressed, or hurt when they need their own space.  Several friendships in the past have been strained by this.  I know it's an issue and I've really taken a lot of strides to reign this in. But I know the real cure to this issue is to just deal with the social anxiety that causes it in the first place.\n\nAnyway. \n\nMy goal for this year is to finally overthrow that damn anxiety that's stopped me from living my life thus far.  I'm not entirely sure how to go about it.  I live in a highly religious area where I am not able to speak very freely about my thoughts, since I am so....*everything they're not* when it comes to religion/politics/social ideas.  So that kind of makes it more difficult to find people.  But I do want to try.  \n\nHave any of you struggled with this? What have you done to combat it?\n\n\n**TL;DR** Social anxiety stops me from living the life I want to live.  I want to end that this year, and any advice you have to do that would be great!",
