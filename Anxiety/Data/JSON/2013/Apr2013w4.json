These are the things that you will learn through therapy.  The things that your brain thinks are so horrible that they must be hidden from you at all costs.\n\nFirst, I should say that my anxiety is partly learned.  My mom had such a horrifying childhood that she pretty much faced every day as possibly her last if she didn't look out.  I learned that behavior from her.\n\nAs a result of her childhood experience, it wasn't possible for my mom to love me, and it was also possible that she might have killed me if I didn't watch *myself*.  This is what my brain didn't want me to know.  She had several episodes while I was growing up when she lost touch with reality.  At those times, she could have done anything.\n\nLikewise, my father was an abusive and extremely narcissistic person.  He's not really able to care for anyone but himself and he's not going to realize that in this lifetime.\n\nTogether, my parents made for a hellish homelife.  But what did my brain tell me?  It told me that I had the best parents ever!\n\nIt amazes me how few words it takes to tell the tale, but how long it took to get this into my consciousness.  Until I understood this, it affected every single relationship that I had.  Apparently, my brain thought it would be a good idea to seek out people who had the same traits that my parents had so that I could *try again* and make it work out right this time.\n\nIt took me too many years to get into therapy and start to straighten all of this out.  Looking at what I just wrote, it is terrible and sad, but it still somehow isn't as bad as my brain made me think it would be.  I'm glad I went through the therapy and started to gain control of my life.  I only wish that I had started sooner.",

Why?? Because it really shows an understanding of what anxiety is. The fact that the character is suffering from this after as serious life changing event is something that does happen in real life. \n\nWhile we have not strapped on a super suit and battled aliens, we have, all of us suffered some trauma that has lead our minds down this path.\n\nI guess what I m trying to say is that I am delighted that \n1: Anxiety/Panic is shown to millions as something through cinema\n2: It is portrayed very well in terms that it happens multiple times and not something our hero \"just mans up too\"\n3: Prompted my nephew to turn to me and ask, \"What's anxiety\" showing that its getting the word out there in the hope of normalising it to the general public as something real and life changing.\n\nJust my two cents!\n\n What do you think???\n\nPS I sat there while others left and managed my anxiety about been trapped by the crowd to watch the after credits scene : )\n\nEdit: Spelling and additional spoiler warning.",

No accomplishment is too big or small! *Not a single one.*\n\nIf you want to say why it's a big step for you, go for it! That's awesome. Don't want to? Great! Also awesome.\n\n(And hey, are you reading this and can't get up the nerve to do it? But you're thinking about it, right? Great! That is a big step.)\n\nSo, here's something I've done today: I realized I was acting anxious but didn't know why, so I sat down and wrote a (long) journal entry and let out everything on my mind.

I am very very very glad I found this subreddit because it has been critical in treating my generalized anxiety disorder (which is just going to be a short term thing in my life) in conjunction with seeing my doctor and therapist.  \n\nUsually when I wake up my alarms are blaring and I freak out.  I'll roll out of bed turn off both alarms with a snooze button and go back to sleep.  This will continue on and on until the day gets away from me and I more than likely miss an appointment.  This causes my anxiety levels to sky rocket once more and I retreat to my bed because it's \"safe warm and incredibly comfortable\".  \n\nThis morning however I woke up completely naturally.  I woke up to the birds chirping and sun rising and it felt **sooooooo** good to wake up without a pang of fear or anxiety in chest.  For the first time in a long time I could remember what it was to feel normal in the morning.  \n\nNaturally waking up for me however was a complete fluke.  I'm in college and don't get the amount of sleep that I typically need most times so I have to rely on some sort of system that wakes me up.  \n\nWhat can I do? How can I wake up more naturally without being worried about keeping my appointment dates on my calendar? ",

My wife wants me to do things around the house(I have no problem doing it) but there are a few things I need to fix that I have no experience with, my oven for example, and I politely asked them to leave the kitchen so I could concentrate. They went to the next room and just got louder, I explained that I need some quiet so I can concentrate and try and fix the problem. It just kept escalating to the point that I slammed my oven door shut, knocked my cast iron skillets off the top of the stove and it broke a bunch of beer bottles. Now my wife is demanding that I 'get my lazy ass excuse for a man in the kitchen and clean up my mess'. I grabbed my laptop and headed for the garage and shut myself in it so I can relax. I know I over reacted but damn, all I wanted was a little peace and quiet. It's hard enough for me to concentrate(just suffered a TBI from being thrown off of a horse 10 days ago.) when it's quiet, let alone when there's a bunch of noise.",

Part of the way my anxiety manifests itself is constantly worrying about my relationship. im in a relationship with a loving but sometimes snappy 27 year old female.\n\nLast night as we got ready for bed, i notice she seemed disturbed. I asked what was wrong and of course she said \"nothing\" but she was clearly annoyed. I asked if i had done anything and she said she \"didnt want to get into it now\" because she \"doesnt want to fight\"\n\nwe went to bed and i couldnt stop myself from going over and over the past few hours in my head trying to figure out what i had said and done wrong. I asked her again and she said \"baby just let it go! cant you just let it go?\" at this point anxiety really washed over me and i was shaky and nervous. since i had NO idea what i had done i began to wonder how bad it was....(the thing i seemed to have done) she refused to tell me and i began to tear up.\n\nI said i was worried that all day tomorrow im going to be wondering what i did. and she said i was trying to \"guilt\" her into telling me what i had done. she said now i definitely cant tell you because then youll always pry for it.\n\nshe tried to comfort me though. she knows i have anxiety and that i worry about breakups and she told me \"im not gonna break up with you baby dont worry\"\n\nand thats the worst part because sometimes im totally normal,  and sometimes i worry that the slightest fuck up will cause her to dump me. the LOGICAL part of me knows that makes no sense and that she cares for me and wouldnt just do that at the drop of a hat. but the ANXIETY part of me is terrified from time to time.\n\nI still dont know what i did wrong but im told it wasnt a huge deal and not worth talking about. She is Catholic and tried to pray with me in bed to calm me down. but i felt kind of patronized by it.\n\nthoughts? suggestions? i could use some advice!!!",

Growing up, I was pretty popular in school, and had a lot of friends. Sometime around my Jr. year, I had kind of a panic attack where my face turned red and it really embarrassed me. Ever since that day, I struggled through high school, afraid that my face would turn red in front of others. It got so bad that just talking to my friends I would worry about my face turning red and couldnt even concentrate on what i was saying! And to make things worse, people would say; \"Why is your face so red?\"  Anyways, after a while, I developed social anxiety, and i was a completely different person than i was before my attack. Fast forward 2 years, freshman year in college. It was at the beginning of my freshman year that i found a book online called \"At Last a Life.\" Im telling you, this book changed my life. Not only have i recovered from my anxiety, but im even more confident and outgoing than i was before my anxiety attack. Please, I beg you to check out this book. Sorry for the wall of text, but i just wish i would have come across this book alot sooner..",

            "selftext": "The very first thing that I found out was how much food triggers anxiety.  I am MSG sensitive.  MSG is labelled under many other food ingredients including Maltodextrin or hydrolyzed vegetable protein found in many products ranging from almost ALL potato chips to yogurt to breads to peanut butter.  Another things was very sugary foods, try eating sugary food ONLY after eating a full meal of protein and complex carbs.  I may be msg sensitive but know that crappy food is a stress trigger for EVERYONE.\n\nSide note:Once I started eating unprocessed food, I was always skinny but a pleasant surprise was a subtle 6 pack formed where my otherwise fatless but soft abdomen was and I discovered I could achieve a 6 pack quite easily.  Never in my life was this possible.\n\nOnce I cut taking vitamins with crap in them and only eating certain processed foods sporadically my immediate anxiety decreased I would say 50%.  I cannot explain to another person what this transition was like because I felt like I walked into another dimension.  I didn't know who I was anymore because my personality was accustomed to an anxiety disorder.  I was a new man... it. was. amazing.  I have only a vague memory of what my life was like before.\n\nThe next step was and honesty is the cure to everyone's anxiety, meditation.  But I never could meditate until it was explained to me by someone to think of it as being mindful, present, and in the moment of now, to focus on a slow exhaling breath while sighing slightly.  It is a RELEASING breathe.  It doesn't matter if a million things pop into your brain as long as you are always trying to focus on your breath again, it WILL work eventually.\n\nLast point, if you need to see a therapist from any trauma to acute stressor in your life, or your job or something like that, all that other stuff will help without a doubt but you need to deal with the issues in your life too.  Therapy helped me tremendously.\n\nGood luck!",
