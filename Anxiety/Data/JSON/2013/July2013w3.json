She said that while she was driving through she had two panic attacks. \n\nI suppose it's possible she did indeed have two panic attacks. However, I only recall having three or four in my anxiety-ridden life (24 years old), one of which was particularly horrific, involving serious hyperventilation which led to a loss of control in my hands and facial muscles (they sort of crumpled up). The others were less severe, but still had me breathing fast and deep with an overwhelming sense of desperation. \n\nSo, when I hear people just toss out the phrase \"panic attack\", I'm a little...annoyed. Anyone else experience this?\n\nEdit: Alright people, I'm big enough to admit that belittling my friend's experience was not the best way to handle my frustration and that there are probably some feelings that came before my annoyance that I should take some time to sit with. Got it. \n\nAlso, I felt like this was a pretty mild post, and then some of you just rain down judgement. I realize I was in the wrong a little bit here, but how about some steady, loving confrontation, eh?

I *have* to leave the house today and I've been trying to build up the courage to do so for nearly 3 hours now.   I'm sweating.  I've cried twice.  My stomach is turning.  But, I *have* to leave the house.  \n\n8 months ago I moved 200 miles away from my family, friends, and a career I loved because of my husbands job.  Because he's the new guy, he's putting in a ton of hours.  I'm home alone, a lot.   I have no friends here.  I have no job.  I have no doctor. I have no medication. I really dont know where things are.  I dont fit in here.  I've gained 21lbs since moving here.  I don't have enough sex with my husband.  I dont leave the house, ever.   I *have* to leave the house.  \n\nI should go see a doctor, but that would require a phone call and leaving the house.  I should start practicing yoga again, but the thought of walking into a new practice is terrifying to me, and I'd have to leave the house.  I cant find a job in my field.  I should get any job, just to get me out of the house.  I *have* to leave the house.  \n\nI've had anxiety for as long as I can remember.  I've always managed to keep it under control without medication (mostly).  This move has killed me.  I have no idea who I am anymore.  In 8 months I've gone from an outgoing social butterfly to someone who goes days without showering and would rather starve than go to the supermarket.  Writing this post is making me anxious.  People on the internet judging me, is making me anxious.  \n\ni ***have*** to leave the house.  \n\nedit: you guys, thanks so much for the support, suggestions and kind words.  As I said in response to /u/minkamink, it all seems so obvious now, the small things I can do for myself.  I guess I needed someone to just slap me in the face with it.   And, **I left the house**.  I took out the trash, got the mail, went to the market, and made it back alive.  I feels *good.*  I'm trying not to be too excited, since its only one day, but I'm pretty proud of myself.   I'm really I happy I found the sub.  It's like you all brought me good mojo today! ",

It's a much better opportunity hands down.\n\nThe problem is that I have to quit this other job without giving 2 weeks notice. They owe me about $150. I am terrified.\n\nMy anxiety has always left me feeling completely responsible for everyone else's problems and made it really, really hard for me to say no to anything. I have to do this TONIGHT! I've just been sitting here trying to work up the courage to call or go in, but I can't. I just feel like they're going to yell at me and I'll start crying or they'll find a way to force me to continue working there.\n\nI understand that a lot of this is irrational and there's a high turnover rate in this industry, they expect this, etc. but I just can't get over the fear. \n\nHelp?!\n\n\n***EDIT:\n\nI quit!

With all of those other things people will just shake their heads and occasionally make suggestions about general life; once I come out as anxious its all \"deal with it\" and \"put on your big girl panties.\" I am surrounded by wonderful people who have a lot of live and wisdom, but little experience with mental health. Most of the people who I have told try to be supportive but don't understand and didn't end up being helpful. I don't want to spurn help and love, but it seems like they think its a thing that will get better in a few months, and that is just exhausting to have to explain again and again so I try not to bring it up at all. Is this better or am I hurting myself? I just don't know anymore and I'm afraid its getting worse again. Any thoughts or experiences? ",

Makes me feel like I'm perceived as a complete moron because apparently I don't have the capacity to have done all these things before. \n\nMedication, breathing techniques, CBT, DBT, mindfulness, meditation, the list goes on, and no matter how I say 'I've done those' no one ever stops or listens. Anxiety isn't a headache or a cold, you don't just take a cough syrup for a few days and then your cured. It comes in waves, its affected by different things for different people. Even when you have been given the tools to help calm yourself *it doesn't stop the anxiety from coming back*.\n\nIf you're diabetic an you take a shot of insulin you're not cured. It's the same with MH issues. You just learn to live with it and adapt your behaviours to better help yourself. \n\nDon't treat me like I'm self diagnosing, that I'm over reacting, or that I've not done *everything* in my power to help myself. I have, and sometimes I just need to vocalise what I'm experiencing to stop it rattling around in my head. \n\nI am having an anxiety attack. It will pass. But right now its here.
