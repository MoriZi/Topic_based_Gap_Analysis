Problem is, life is fucked up, weird and things don't always go the way we want them too. But I feel like in that, life is beautiful, and sometimes we need to wade through the shit. I'm an anxiety sufferer myself. I've recently decided to move to Los Angeles with my girlfriend whom I love very much. I've been kind of a dick to her lately though, as she's just as nervous as I am. I grew up wanting to make people laugh and do comedy, voice acting, commercials, etc. I've decided I'm gonna do that now, and of course anxiety starts to creep back into my life. I think the best thing to do is embrace the shit out of it. I'm never gonna eliminate anxiety altogether, and I've accepted that. Sometimes it's worse than others, and I think it's really interesting how all of our brains work. We can comfort each other and do all the research in the world, but once we get something in our mind, it's set. It's such an amazing and dumb train of thought. I hope all of you start to feel better soon, I really do. I look at this subreddit, and google searches, and the stuff/medicine out there for all of us, and it kind of pisses me off that people are making so much money off of us. If it helps, fine. But I see so many people on here writing about how something they're trying or have tried isn't working, and my heart goes out to them. I suppose I'm just anxious myself about this move in July. Anyway, thanks for reading this little rant. I hope you're doing what you need to do to feel better. I know it's tough at times, and can feel unbearable. Just know we're all here for you. Remember one thing. Take it easy on yourself. You're only human, and you're doing the best you can in this crazy world. ::Hug::",

I'm scared to tell my parents, I already have a sister on disability for her mental problems and they're still half supporting her.

I don't know how to ask for help.

I want to go back, but I can't afford it yet and I'm scared I'll fail out again. I don't think I can get a loan, my credit is probably already horrible.\n\nI don't know how to tell my parents what's going on, I don't want them to treat me like they treated my sister, she went insane when they put her on anti-depressants. I spent most of my youth with a padlock on my bedroom door because she would steal from me and sometimes she got violent (She never hurt me, but did dislocate my mother's jaw, and they fist fought. I always held my mother after these fights and promised not to dissapoint her)\n\nI have no friends. I go to a therapist sometimes for the assault situation but I don't like going because being there just reminds me of what happened. \n\nI want to find proper help, but I can't afford it, and I'm scared of medications. I'm scared to ask my parents, I don't think they can go through this again. They've said so before.\n\nI'm hysterical as I write this, I apologize.",

For myself personally at least, I constantly worry about my anxiety. That's right: I worry about being worried.\n\nHow (objectively) ridiculous is that?\n\nBut I think the key is to understand and then accept that I'll likely have some amount of anxiety for the rest of my life, I'll probably always be bothered by X Y or Z trigger. But I can minimize its significance and thus its impact if I just accept these as things that happen in my life, just like any other routine event. \n\nSo, like the Hulk, acceptance is at least half the battle. \n\nIf nothing else, entertain yourself with this: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Qq6dQwLh1s",

He says a lot of inappropriate stuff. But usually it's nbd.\nBut this is something that is really personal and really embarrassing for me. I mean, it feels like I can't cope with life sometimes.\n \nAnywho, How do I bring up such a touchy subject without sending myself into a panic attack? What should I say to him? How should I say it so I don't get in trouble?\n\nTL;DR: Boss teases me about panic attacks to make it lighthearted, it makes me embarrassed. How do I talk to him about it?",

            "selftext": "I was diagnosed with anxiety discorder and depression approximately six years ago, I just turned 19 in December last year. It was from being bullied quite terribly to the point where I didn't eat/sleep/leave the house or leave my bed for that matter. I was in a relationship for two years, and he was amazing with the anxiety and panic attacks, at one point we were so serious we moved in together and at that time I was dealing with at minimum four panic attacks a day. \n\nAfter our relationship ended, I was the lowest I had ever felt and decided to finally seek treatment for this disorder, unfortunately no one around me really understood what I was going through, I wish I had reddit at the time to maybe do something like this, better late then never though I hope. So after almost a year of server therapy (which is by the way the hardest thing I ever did and ever will do) I finally stopped being anxious all the time, getting panic attacks, 99% of my social anxiety was gone, I was the most strong I'd ever felt, it sucked that because my friends didn't understand what anxiety really did to me and my mind it wasn't as celebrated as I expected it to be, anyway I should've been doing everything I couldn't do whilst I was dealing with this disorder, but my ex was leading me on for this entire time and the other week all of a sudden he stopped all communication and also started saying really mean things to me about anxiety too, this coming from the person two weeks ago that said \"I love you I want to be with you for the rest of my life.\" \n\nBasically since then anxiety has come roaring back into my life, I'm feeling uneasy all the time, I keep feeling like I need to ground myself or grab onto something, I'm shaky and definitely dealing with a lot of anxiety related thoughts/pains. I'm also feeling pretty defeated to be honest, I mean I thought it was over, but I guess because he was my comfort zone and he was supposed to be there, anxiety is the only other form of comfort I have. \n\nI apologise for the length but if anyone is feeling bored and wants to give some advice, anything like that is appreciated because really right now all I feel is lost and I don't feel like I'm strong enough to get through it all over again. \n",

She has been in contact with him every night for the past 6 or so months. \n\nShe told me a few weeks ago that she will be meeting this guy, she is 21 years old, I guess she can do what ever she likes. However, when I start asking her when she is meeting him, she started lying and telling me \"probably never\".\n\nWell, one thing I know for fact is she never leaves the house, ever ever ever - besides uni/gym or work. But last night she didn't come home! It seems almost impossible that she thinks she could get away with staying out over night without people questioning her when she came home the next night (so far). \n\nI know last week she got her hair nicely done, she made a comment about needed to get her hair done before meeting this guys. She got her hair done, and she is actually leaving the house, so naturally I'm trying to get info off her. Yesterday when she is leaving the house I ask here where she is going, she told me she was merely going to university for orientation - where she has been a mentor (giving students tours around campus) previously. So yesterday I could believe that.\n\nThough she doesn't come home, I know she never goes out, so I'm totally convinced she has meet up with this man.\n\nAnnoyingly, she only has one friend who she hangs out with regularly (maybe once a fortnight), so I try to get info off her, but my sister lied to her. But a couple of weeks ago, my sister told her friend what hotel he was staying at - but had told her he cancelled his trip last minute. I should point out he is from a different state (supposedly). \n\nI called the hotel, and since I know his name (from my sisters skype account), the receptionist confirmed he has checked in for two nights, checked out this morning.\n\n(no other information, as she seemingly only has phone conversations with this guy, no written conversations at all).\n\nOther info I got from her computer, well Friday night she said she was going to a presentation at uni, but her internet browser suggests she was actually in the city's China Town. She told me she was mentoring at her uni, that being why she wore runners that day, but her browser suggests she went for a bush walk.\n\nI'm just so worried, she wont answer her phone. I'm scared for her safety, it just doesn't make sense that she would say she is gone only one day - not night - and not expect us to question her when she got home. Why isn't she home !? Why did she lie about it? \n\nIt's only 6:20pm in Australia, and last anyone has heard from her was probably about 10am yesterday (Saturday). If she isn't home by the time I wake up tomorrow, I will call the police. \n\nBut I'm freaking out right now.",

Out of embarrassment, I moved my thread over here. \n\nI have clinical depression/anxiety. I've struggled with it since adolescence. For the record, I'm a girl just entering my mid-twenties. One of the main issues I have difficulty with in therapy is trying not to view myself as abnormal and inferior to those who do not have depression or a type of anxiety disorder. I'm always comparing myself to \"normal\" people and asking myself, \"What would a [supposedly] normal person do? How would they act? How do they get through their day so easily?\"\n\nI understand what we see isn't necessarily reality, as people tend to broadcast the positive aspects of their lives and hide what is truly going on, but it just seems like a different world if you don't have these issues. \n\nPardon my ignorance, I've been wondering this for a long time.

I was in therapy for about 8 years and finally got my anxiety under control so I stopped therapy. 2 years ago I started abusing alcohol, and about a year ago I had a panic attack that landed me in the ER and was diagnosed with hypertension. Ever since that day my anxiety has come back ten fold. It is almost debilitating and has manifested itself in ALOT of physical symptoms. I am constantly in a brain fog and feel light headed, I have extreme exhaustion and nausea almost everyday and I feel like my body is shutting down. It is beginning to really effect my relationships (I have a very loving and supportive boyfriend) and I am terrified that my boyfriend will get fed up with the fact that I feel ill all the time and leave me. I was wondering if anyone else has felt this way (especially with the physical symptoms) I am trying to see a doctor but no one is getting back to me soon enough and I am really terrified that I will go to sleep and not wake up one day. Please respond.    ",
