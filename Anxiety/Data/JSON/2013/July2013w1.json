I thought it made me weak, but, this has been the best decision I have ever made in my life. I got prescribed Xanex and Lexapro, and I can really feel a difference, my life has changed. If you are struggling, PLEASE go and get help, It does not make you weak, sometimes its the strongest thing you can do to reach out for help. \n\nEdit: Thank you all for the encouraging comments. I was also very intimidated by Xanex, but my doctor recommended it over Colonopin (which was what I was hoping for). He gave me .5 MG dosage and recommended that I cut them in half if needed. I am very aware of the habit forming tendencies of Xanex so I am very careful with it. In regards to Lexapro, I have really felt a change, I know the Dr said you would not be able to for a few weeks, but I just feel overall more positive about things. ",

            "selftext": "Hello, it is my first time posting here! I am a rising senior in high school and around 2-3 years ago I started to have severe anxiety whenever I got a new e-mail, a phone message... even menial things like weighing myself (I am not overweight nor do I have big body-image issues). I feel my heart pounding and I tell myself every single excuse not to check it, even when it just turns out to be an advertisement or a friendly message. In addition, I've struggled most with checking my grade or score (especially standardized testing) while I've noticed that my classmates can barely wait to see what they got. \n\nI am an A student (and always have been since I was in elementary) and when I confided in a few friends about this, they told me I had nothing to worry about when getting back tests or essays because I would have most likely gotten a good grade (I'm not tooting my own horn here, please don't misunderstand this post!). Although most of the time that is true, every time I see one bit of constructive criticism written in red, it feels like my heart stops and the whole day I just mull over why the teacher didn't like my work. I know it is constructive criticism and people aren't out to get me, but I don't know why I don't feel content at ALL when I get 100s but if I get one 85, it nags at me for weeks until I feel like throwing up. \n\nI am tired of avoiding checking on feedback and most times, I get mad at myself. \"It's just like a band-aid, just rip it off and it'll be over in two seconds\", yet I feel like this behavior is getting worse. I am applying to colleges this year and I don't think I could do it to be honest. I am petrified at even getting feedback on my college essays so I don't even know how I will feel getting acceptance/rejection letters from colleges. \n\nPlease help. Thank you!\n\n**tl;dr Can not get myself to check e-mails or grades because I am scared of criticism and failure, behavior getting worse as college applications start this year**",

            "selftext": "Hello r/anxiety!\n\nI am currently 20 year old female, attending school and working.\n\nI'm having a hard time right now. I've been seeing 2 different counselors and a Psychiatrist for the past 2 years, and have been stuck and lost. The first therapist I saw helped me out a lot. I have felt so much progress with her, especially seeing the root to my anxiety and why its gotten me to this point. But then, she left and was placed with another after a year. She's sweet, very nice and loving, but I feel like I haven't progressed much with her. And then while going to counseling I decided to go to a Psychiatric Center to try medication to calm my nerves since everything, and anything, makes me nervous. Not to mention I was feeling so numb. So I want, was diagnosed and given Prozac. It helped me out so much. I felt calm and even happy. But then after 3 months I became depressed every time I took my dose, and even got off to make sure. Then was placed on Effexor, which worked for me for the next 3 months but then it made me irritated, angry, short-tempered and even gained weight and once more stopped taking it. Then took Celexa and immediately got depressed. \n\nAfter those, I was told perhaps I was bipolar. I decided to give the idea a shot, and took Trileptal but did nothing for me--it even made me depressed. I wanted to give it a chance, but just saw I was harming myself. I even dropped my birth control and changed and no change occurred but my menstrual cycle regulating. Even been having a hard time losing weight.\n\nIt's been a month without medication.\n\nAnd so, I gave up on the idea of taking medication. I am not bipolar. I am not depressed. I have anxiety. And the anxiety is making me miserable, thus causing depression. I am back to feeling numb, unable to know what I should be working on. I need help, and I want to learn how to get rid of this numb feeling. It's affected how I feel about everything, including my boyfriend. I know I love my boyfriend, but im so numb I don't feel the dread of going to work, no appetite for anything and eating gives no pleasure (I took advantage of this and i'm eating healthier), no pleasure in sex and no feeling of love towards my boyfriend.\n\nPlease, someone reach out for me. I feel like, I can't do this anymore. Like i'm slowly giving up, and I no longer want to live. \n\n\n\n\nI miss finding life pleasurable. \n\n\nPlease, someone help me. The only feeling I ever feel is nothing or anxiety. '\n\n\n\nUPDATE: Thank you guys, I did not expect the amount of responses and support. I love you all, and thank you all. I hope you guys do well in your battles as well. I decided to ditch the place in which get counselling. ",

I have had severe anxiety and depression for years now and am currently seeing a psych because I may sill have ADD from when I was younger. I am currently on 20mg of lexapro a day. A few years ago I was having intrusive violent thoughts towards the ones I love, things like if I saw a knife on the bench (even writing this scares me), or if I was holding a baby a thought would flash through my mind of dropping it or throwing it, they have now started to return. I am in no way a violent person, the last fight I was in was in grade 3. I love my family so much I would never harm them. Has anyone had anything similar to this before? Any help would be appreciated",

Not the intense anxiety, but just a general background level of elevated anxiety. I get nervous when I can't check it, and I get nervous when I see bad things happening. \n\n&gt;News is toxic to your body. It constantly triggers the limbic system. Panicky stories spur the release of cascades of glucocorticoid (cortisol). This deregulates your immune system and inhibits the release of growth hormones. In other words, your body finds itself in a state of chronic stress. High glucocorticoid levels cause impaired digestion, lack of growth (cell, hair, bone), nervousness and susceptibility to infections. The other potential side-effects include fear, aggression, tunnel-vision and desensitisation.\n",

            "selftext": "Hello! I am new to this sub, so I hope I'm not doing this wrong. I am currently not experiencing much (if any) anxiety, and I hope it stays this way! I came here as I wanted to share my story, and maybe give some people hope/advice. So here goes nothing:\n\nFirst of all, when at it's worst, I had truly crippling anxiety; I laid on my sofa day in and day out, even slept on it. I couldn't even go in to the kitchen, I rarely ate, I even got anxiety by watching the darn TV. I could not enjoy anything and my life was living hell, I was just waiting for something better to come along I guess. Panic attacks happened once or twice a day, and I always felt some level of high anxiety. Going outside or going in the shower was WAY out of my comfortzone and never/rarely happened.\n\nSo what happened that left me here? It's a long story but I'll try to keep it short -- When I was 17-21 years old I did a lot of drugs, took no responsibilities, and it ended up costing me my home and job and basically all my friends. These years are still a big dark messy cloud to me, I can only remember very few things, things which were all bad and filled with paranoia, violence and \"bad company\". After my mother moved back to town, she let me move back in, this was basically the turning point of my life, and everything there on after has been going really fast. \n\nSo I decided fuck it, I'm going to stop taking drugs and pull my shit together. Said and done, I had met a girl, got clean, got an apartment, got a kid, got a job. Things had turned out GREAT. I got this job as a system developer, a very mentally demanding job, and the amount of responsibilities and pressure I had on me was very big, especially with the kid at home. From this moment, and 6 months on, my days basically looked like;\n\n\n * 7 AM - Get up, go to work.\n\n * 18 PM - Come home, eat dinner, take care of kid\n\n * 20 PM  - 02 AM - Kid is asleep: Freetime, fuck yes!\n\n * 5 AM - Go to sleep, sleep 2 hours at best.\n\n * Repeat\n\n\n6 months later, I hit the wall. I was burned out. Going from nothing to everything in that short of time fried my brain out good. I remember the tipping point, It was an early sunday morning, I was fudging about on the computer and drinking a lot of coffee. 3 huge cups on an empty stomach. Suddenly, out of nowhere, everything was moving REALLY fast, I was sweating like a pig, thought I had a heartattack. It was in fact my first panic attack out of a LOT of them.\n\nSo. This point in time + 6 months, I'm doing what I first described, Laying in the couch, waiting for the agony to end. I slept so friggin much these months, dreamt the weirdest shit. My fiancee took care of both our daughter and me during this time, the angel that she is.  Anxiety aside, the effects of my mental burnout was severe, I could barely think, speak, or do logical thinking. I had a hard time opening a car door.\n\nThe time passed, I got more and more energy, started feeling more normal in my cognitive abilities again. The anxiety remained though. Now I at least had the energy to do something about it, so I did!  It started with baby steps, taking long showers and ignoring the panic attacks, futile as they were (in the long run). Just tried to enjoy myself. Few weeks later I had successfully went out to go shopping at my local small market! The anxiety was killing me but I had done it! SUCCESS!\n\nMonths went by, and just recently it really have started disappearing completely! I can go out to eat, go to them big malls/stores that are crowded with people and not give a fuck again! I feel so free again! :)\n\nI am still not 100% recovered, but it's getting there! My tricks was rather simple actually:\n\n* For panic attacks; Breath slowly, try not to think to fast, as it often just makes it worst. When you get some sort of grip in your brain, just keep telling yourself: There is NO real danger. What I'm feeling is simply stupid remains of our caveliving, cheetah-fighting times when these things was neccessary. I am as safe as can be.  Etc.\n\n* For general anxiety; Set up goals, ignore your anxiety and widen your comfortzone at least once a week. As long as you can think to yourself; I have done progress, you will get more progress done. Never loose hope! Babysteps are great. Start small. Conquer the tiniest stones, use that motivation and soon you're standing on top of mount everest screaming your lungs off! (By euphoria, not anxiety).\n\nNEVER be scared to face your fears! They are nothing but fears, then can not harm you in any way! They are cowards who simply run away when you confront them for about 10-15 minutes. Fears exist because you let them control you. \n\nAlso; If you are feeling anxiety anyway, it doesnt really matter where and under what circumstances you are feeling them, right? \n\nHave a splendid evening, sorry for a huge post, and dont be afraid to ask me anything!\n\n",

            "selftext": "I recently became aware that the main source of my severe anxiety is a fear of being trapped, both physically and metaphorically.  For example, I've been known to have a panic attack when trying to remove a tight sweater, or when I'm in a room with a faulty doorknob, but I'm also seeing that making a commitment of some type makes me panicky.  Even something as simple as promising to bring dessert for a dinner sets me off.  My biggest source of stress is my son, who has moderate autism and may require care for the rest of his life.  I'm feeling tremendously guilty that I feel \"trapped\" by my son!  Does anyone else experience this type of anxiety?\nI'm on 90 mg Cymbalta for MDD and GAD, and I have lorazepam to use as needed.  My depression has improved quite a bit since upping the Cymbalta (I used celexa for years and it gradually lost effectiveness) but the anxiety is still very bad.",

            "selftext": "I've got social anxiety disorder (among other things). Not sure how bad it is but if I'd have to guess I'd say it's somewhere between moderate and severe. It's not severe enough for me to not leave the house but it's triggered as soon as I walk out the door to my room (and even when in my room writing things in forums like this). My social anxiety is general, not specific. There are loads of things which I get really anxious about (thinking that people are looking at me and judging me, meeting new people etc). One of the things which I'm very scared of is talking in front of a group of people. Doesn't matter if it's a small or a big group, I freak out anyway. I sometimes even go \"mute\" because my body tense up so much and my mind is so chaotic that I feel like I can't open my mouth.\n\nI'm going to start university in the end of August. I really want to study and I'm determined to do so. However, I'm sort of panicking because I know you have to give a lot of presentations and participate in group discussions when studying. I'm also freaking out about having to meet new people. Thinking about it even makes me doubt my decision to study but I have goals and dreams and I'm going to achieve them. Quite a few people (professionals) have told me that my diagnoses (social anxiety disorder, GAD, OCD and depression, though I'm personally not convinced I've got OCD) limit my chances of succeeding when it comes to studies but I'm planning on proving them wrong. I'm terrified but I'm going to prove them wrong.\n\nNow I'm simply wondering if any of you have got social anxiety disorder (or any of the other diagnoses) or if any of you have got issues with presentations etc? If you've been to or if you're going to university/college would you please let me know how that's been going for you? Has it been going well? Do you get used to presentations and group discussions? Any advice?\n\nThank you.\n\nEDIT: Fixed spelling mistake.",

            "selftext": "Does anyone who experiences / has experienced anxiety about talking to people you've known for a while have any advice on how to overcome it?  I can talk to strangers fine, and I love meeting new people, but after hanging out with someone three times or hanging out with people I know for years I get ultra nervous about what they think of me.  I think they think I'm stupid, boring, negative and rude, and I clam up.  I don't want to share anything about me or express myself naturally.  It's easier with a stranger.\n\nAn example - this weekend my cousins had a party.  I grew up with them, I visit them a few times a year.  They're very nice and great at asking insightful questions about people's lives and showing interest, but I still have a hard time talking to them.  I'm different than them, it makes me feel like an outsider - I'm the 'artist' of the family.  I'm very quiet, I never say enough.  They seemed a little surprised I was able to make friends at the party and chat up a storm, and remarked that they would have been sitting in a corner sulking at a party with no one they knew.\n\nI worry a lot about not doing enough to help out, and not doing enough for myself.  I feel like a child when I'm around them, the attitude of their households is my home is your home ... but when I'm helping them clean after the party I don't know where things go, how they like things done or where the cleaning supplies are.  It makes me hesitant to help out, and hesitant to put a lot of effort into things.  I often go hungry while I'm visiting because I'm too nervous to find something to eat or let them know I need to eat.  I would love to cook for them, I'm a good cook and food is great for bonding, but when I think about asking them to take me to the grocery store and paying for food I feel it isn't worth it.  I didn't get mix for my vodka for the party because I was too nervous to drop into a store.  My brain shuts off.  I worry a lot about seeming stupid, I'm sure I do because I can't do anything for myself.\n\nThings are much better than they were years ago, it used to be that I was too nervous to poop or shower.  How can I relax, stop worrying and be myself?",

There are so many bad things that could happen to anyone at anytime given that they draw the shortest stick in that moment in time.\n\nI want to see the world without paranoia and fear in everything. I do not hallucinate, but I over-think everything and play out terrible scenes over and over in my head. \n\nHow does everyone here cope with their irrational fears?

Complete internal panic, and sometimes with external manifestations (crying fits, etc.) Anyhow, none of that is the point.\n\nWhen I feel myself begin to panic, I seek out answers. When something has the potential to go awry, I immediately want to know the possible outcomes and the outcomes of those outcomes and so on. For example,  if I was suddenly feeling insecure because my long-term, long-distance boyfriend was out having lunch or drinks with a female friend, I would want to know where he was, what he was doing, what I would do if he cheated, how likely he was to cheat, how likely he would be to admit to it, how to know if anything happened, and what I would do if I broke up with him. Then I'd get into how it would change my daily routine, what I would do to fill new time slots, etc. (For the record, he is very faithful and logically I know that none of this is a concern. My anxiety just refuses to listen when it gets all worked up.)\n\nThis is a routine for me.\n\nWhat I've started doing, and what I've found helps, is Reddit.

I feel like I answer my own questions, or at least am calmed enough to not need some of them answered anymore.\n\nSo, next time you panic, or feel you're about to ... try to write out a post. Don't post it, or do if you feel like you can't answer your own questions. Maybe someone else can!",
