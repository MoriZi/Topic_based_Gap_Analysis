That's not the point. Doesn't phase me, happened all the time in high school. It was when I was walking around and people were carrying on their own conversations and then they'd burst into laughter. I couldn't help but feel as though they were laughing at me and I've always felt as though people in stores and malls and other areas were always laughing at me. Over my hair, my clothes, the way I breathe, I'm not even certain what other excuses my brain could come up with for these people to \"laugh at me\". \n\nI'm not sure if this stems from my anxiety or if I'm just slightly paranoid of what I look like to people. I came here to see if anyone else feels this way.\n\nEdit: Since people are asking me to stop caring about what others think, it seems appropriate to mention that I don't exactly mind for what people think about me because I've always been teased and ridiculed and such. I would ask if you would please telling me to stop \"giving a fuck\" because that wasn't the issue in the first place and it seems kinda rude. :/",

            "selftext": "I know it might sound ridiculous, but my major anxiety trigger is bass. Like the bass from a rap song or dance music, that deep vibrating thrumming. I have a mild (VERY mild, I'm not comparing myself to war vets or abuse survivors) form of PTSD from a past event in my home where thrumming bass kept me awake for several days and the perpetrators were aggressive and violent. Glass bottles were thrown at my bedroom walls and windows from the outside, and I went into a full panic alone and with no resources to lean on. I couldn't leave because I was afraid for my safety, and I was in my own home. \n\nAfter the event, it took me about four months to be able to sleep through the night without heavy doses of sedatives. They started to affect my memory, so I stopped taking them as soon as I could cope with earplugs and white noise. I never had any problems with anxiety during the day because it was usually quiet and there are very few people around.\n\nThey say that water torture drives people insane because of the anticipation of the next drop. Right now, that is my life. **There is random thrumming bass vibrating through my apartment at all hours of the day with no consistent pattern.** It's not songs, it's not in any pattern, it's four or five bars of this, four notes here, six notes there, and mostly just fuzz. The first time it happened was late at night, and I assumed it was the neighbors downstairs, so I stepped outside to ask them to be quiet. As soon as I stepped out, silence. I went back inside, it was still there, but from every angle outside it was silent. It's like the music is coming from inside the apartment. It's been a week and **I can't find it.** I can't think of anywhere else it could be. It's like someone embedded speakers in my walls to torture me (my roommate hears the music too, I did consider schizophrenic paranoia-type hallucinations).\n\nI'm at my wit's end. I have to have tv or white noise playing through my headphones at all time to keep me from having a panic attack. If I sit in silence just hearing the cars drive by and the wind blowing the trees, I get anxious and find myself crying and rocking back and forth within 30 minutes waiting for the sounds to start again. I'm worried that the constant headphone use will damage my hearing, and that adds a new level of worry.\n\nI'm asking other anxiety sufferers because I'm hoping you won't just tell me to get over it: **what do I do?** I'm nervous and very depressed, I can't eat, I can't sleep, and if I lose my job from this, I might starve. Please, somebody give me some advice.\n\nUPDATE: It's happening! I'm trying to take deep breaths. I'm watching Scrubs to drown out the noise, it's working pretty well.\n\nI looked at my city's ordinances, they do mention noise not permeating the barriers of other people's homes for extended hours, but if it's less than 30 minutes within an hour, the laws are pretty lax. It's a very liberal town, and the attitude often gets to be \"just let people do what they want\".\n\nThank you so much for the support, sometimes it gets lonely feeling like I'm just a crazy person that no one will ever relate to. I've had pretty dark periods where I swore I would never connect with another human being on a deep level and I should just kill myself. Hey internet strangers, fuck yeah.\n\nPM's are always accepted.",

I knew it was intended to be suspensful, and the previews made me anticipate a potentially scary situation (being stuck in space). But, I had no idea how bad it would be. I've had panic attacks in the past, and in certain sequences, the sounds of the movie almost made me have another one. Sandra Bullock's character starts having a very increased heart rate that the audience can hear, hearing her breath, and hearing a ringing sensation similar to one if you're going to pass out. It freaked me out a lot more than I'd like to admit, but I was able to do some deep breathing to keep myself relatively calm and not have a full-blown panic episode (which, by the way, I haven't had a sever one in close to a month; I'm doing so awesome with it!). If I hadn't been in the comfortable presence of my SO or had developed these coping skills, I could have easily freaked out. Just as a warning, if you're an anxious person/have had panic attacks, Gravity might be triggering. ",

People talk about just ringing a friend up for drinks and meeting a half hour later and it's all a good time? Seems impossible to me. If there's been talk of having dinner with a friend, I need to know where and at what time at least 24 hours beforehand. If not the entire day is a series of progressively more intense panic attacks as I wonder why they haven't texted, whether they've forgotten, whether they think I've forgotten, whether they've just decided they hate me and really don't want to hang out. \n\nA lot of my friends are pretty chill when it comes to making plans.

I have just begun taking 25mg of zoloft yesterday, and will up the dose to 50mg in 5 days time, and up to 100mg in 12 days. I have taken Zoloft previously but stopped abruptly because I was unhappy with a side effect. The specifics of it are that during sex, I was unable to ejaculate for a very long time (sometimes up to an hour and a half). I was very lucky that my girlfriend at the time was understanding and very very patient with me. She tried everything to get me to not worry about it, but instead I just stopped taking the medication.\n\nANYWAY. What I really want to talk about is my big anxiety problem.\n\nAbout 1-5 times per minute I feel like I must breathe extra deep and puff my lungs out as if they would not fill with air otherwise. It's a really uncomfortable feeling and if I'm not able to breathe deep enough, I can't forget about it and I spend the next x minutes trying to breathe. It's a real problem because it distracts me from school, work, conversations, movies, EVERYTHING. It's a really hard thing to describe, but if anyone else thinks they might be experiencing the same thing, I would love to hear it.\n\nThanks.",

Once that's over, I try to go back to sleep, but I end up tossing and turning for the next two or three hours and wishing I could sleep.\n\nIt gets worse after that. He leaves and I work from home, so I spend the next 10 hours alone. I cry on and off (mostly on) for the entire day. I can't eat, I make myself physically ill, and I can barely stay out of bed. Once he gets home, I miraculously regain my appetite and my ability to do things.\n\nI'm always better on weekends, but if he goes to do something without me, I freak out as soon as I find out about it and spend the entire time he's gone crying. At the moment I'm beating myself up and feeling stupid because he woke up early this morning and went downstairs, and once he got up I was unable to sleep, even though I desperately wanted to. (I have a really bad cold and just wanted to sleep in and rest.) I laid in bed trying to focus on my breathing to no avail for almost two hours. BECAUSE HE WAS DOWNSTAIRS INSTEAD OF IN BED WITH ME.\n\nThis only started about a year ago, and I don't know why. I used to enjoy my alone time, and I would go out and do things by myself with no problem. Now I freak out if I have to go to the store alone. Does anyone have any tips? I'm screwing up my health with my disordered sleep and eating patterns, and I have tremendous amounts of guilt for wanting him to stay with me all the time. As mentioned, I also feel completely pathetic. Please help.\n\nEDIT: Thanks for the gold! Now to figure out what to do with it...",

Seeing as anxiety's such a multifaceted disorder which affects people in so many ways, I don't want to draw from my experience alone. \n\nSo if there's anything you wish more people knew, any misconceptions you'd like to correct, any advice or information on dealing with the anxious for those without anxiety, even if it's something unique to you, I want to hear it. \n\nI want to present a speech that's as representative as possible and I'd really appreciate y'all's help in doing so.
