The episode is about her being suck of Hank's rules and then her becoming him in making rules for her own home.\n\nAnyways, something I noticed was where Hank has a heart-to-heart with Luanne and says that he thought he needed his space in the den, but he realized that the lawn is the perfect place for him. When he's out there, nothing else matters. It's his relaxing place. He tells her to find something like that.\n\nShe is cleaning the pool the next day when she starts to notice that the pool is a place where she can be alone with her thoughts. She gets the pH balance to be perfect and calmly explains how she solved her roommate/bills situation. \n\nSo, I took something strong from this. Sometimes when we're anxious, we simply need to find something to dedicate our time to that we truly enjoy. Make it ours. Use it as a meditation experience almost and collect your thoughts to make smart decisions not based heavily on emotion.\n\nFind our lawns!\n\nEdit: I absolutely adore you all. I love how this became a place to post what your \"lawns\" are. It's made me so happy to read all of these. Be proud of your happy place. Dedicate as much time to it as Hank does with propane and propane accessories. :))",

I've been in my own bed for a whole week straight! It's been a bit tough, and I had thought about crawling back into my moms bed at least once every night, but I never did it. Though, this may be more related to laziness then anything ;p \n\nI found that having the tv on at night was easier than setting up music, but it is still a struggle to stay focused on falling asleep. The only problem is that it is about that time when new horror movie commercials will be coming out, and that it the last thing I need while sleeping alone in the dark! \n\nThanks to all those who wrote something encouraging on the last post! And to those who struggle with sleeping like I do, keep trying anything is possible if you want it bad enough :) ",

Hell, I had to think about it for two days before I finally decided to make this post. I'm not especially outgoing, talkative, or smiley a majority of the time; and I'm beginning to think that these attributes give me a sort of \"resting asshole face.\"\n\nI have a decent sized group of friends so I'm confident that I'm a decent person and fun to be around when I'm comfortable. But the thing is, people very rarely approach me. As in, I can't remember the last time someone went out of their way to come talk to me. Worse yet, women NEVER approach me. I know most women aren't especially prone to do that anyway, but it still sucks.\n\nMy older brother and I look very similar (we've been mistaken as twins a few times), and we're both, by most standards, pretty good looking guys. He doesn't suffer from anxiety, and both guys and girls come talk to him all the time. The same doesn't happen to me. I know if I want to meet new people, it's really up to me to make it happen for the most part. But, you know, anxiety lol. It would just be nice if people came to me at least every now and then I guess.\n\nDoes anyone else have the same issue?",

I listen to what everyone tells me all the time and never get the same respect. Or people act like I am not even talking. I need to get this rant out or it will fester inside of me until I go home later and then it will be an even worse rant that I will tell my boyfriend. Getting it out and hearing people agree with this frustration will greatly help me ignore it and move on. Thanks for listening!

            "selftext": "Last weekend was an incredibly good weekend by my standards. As of late I have been very depressed and afraid to hang out with people. Ive had serious social anxiety since I was a teenager that Im pretty sure resulted from growing up in a sheltered private school then switching to a public school. Ever since I graduated and stopped smoking so much things have been going much better. In the past couple of weeks I made the decision to leave my band (not because of my anxiety) and that made me feel really bad. We had a couple more shows to play so I said I would play them cause we had already booked them and I didnt want to be a dick. Long story short we played the greatest show Ive ever played in my life. Something about that night just clicked. Absolutely no fuck ups, 100% crowd participation, it was phenomenal.\n\nSo naturally this left me feeling pretty good. Im normally kind of resentful towards my band mates, as if I never REALLY felt like they were my friends. But after the show we decided to chill at my house and celebrate. I said it was cool cause my mom was out of town. We hung out, drank, smoked, dropped acid, saw a shooting star, went on a trippy adventure etc. Id never had so much fun in my life. I finally felt like these people were my friends. The week after this I felt strangely peaceful and confident. I wasnt afraid to talk to people or answer my phone. I went from going out once or twice a week to almost every night. I even decided to give my band another chance and we have been practicing and writing much more since then. It was a huge step in the right direction and I have been happier ever since.\n\nAcid was one of the greatest experiences of my life. For me it was the catylist for change. It may not work the same for you but it may not hurt to try it.\n",

            "selftext": "Hey! I'm so happy, I've been twitching for like an hour!\n\nSo awhile back I posted for support because I was about to take my test and I get crippling nerves over several things, and driving is one of them.\n\nAnyway, I couldn't take it that day so I made an appointment for today. Well the lady at the front desk was SO nice, but even so, I was still nervous. I thought I could get through it but it took so long waiting. By the time I got to a different lady who takes my photo, I could feel it coming on. \"Oh, this poor lady doesn't know what she's about to witness.\" I tried a breathing exercise I learned in Psychology class and it held the tears back, but my nerves were still on fire.\n\nShe asked me how many times I've taken the the test, and I said 3 or 4, couldn't really recall. A few minutes later she told me it was actually 6(!) Her voice got really low, and she asked me what was wrong. \"Oh no, we're gonna talk about feelings, and she doesn't deserve this.\" I said everything. She took a few seconds and asked if I got really nervous. I nodded, then bit my lip, and started crying. I smiled at her a little to try to let her know I was ok, and because I knew this was going to happen. I said I was sorry, \"This must be really weird for you, some girl crying,\" trying so hard to keep from just sobbing loudly then and there, embarrassing her/putting her in a difficult position.\n\nShe was SO nice and understanding. I normally get kinda offended when people say \"Just don't be nervous,\" but when she said it.... She was like a motherly-figure in this moment and I wanted to make her proud. She told me what to do (pull around back, park in no parking zone), but through the tears I didn't understand so I asked her to repeat. She told me to get up and that she would show me (awww so sweet :,)) The nice old lady at the front desk looked concerned when we went. After we went outside and she showed me, I told her thank you. I honestly didn't expect her to be so understanding, because I figured she must get a lot of teenage girls crying.\n\nShe told me I could have my grandpa sit in the car with me until the instructor showed up, so I did. At first he thought they wouldn't let me take the test because I was clearly still upset by the time I went back in and got him. (He was with me another time this happened, but my mom was there too and she just made it worse. Poppaw made me feel better by not putting any pressure on me to calm down). Well a few minutes later another woman finally showed and it was the instructor. Poppaw made a joke with her, and it set the mood a little lighter, enough for small talk until we got started.\n\n[We're gonna skip 99% of the test] My foot still had it's little seizure on the pedal, I thought I would get in trouble for it. The lady was nice I could tell, so if I felt I mis-understood/heard her, I recited what she said back to her.\n\nAt the end of the test, she said I did good. That still doesn't mean I passed, so I kept listening. (She said I went over pedestrian lines a little, and turned my wheels the wrong way on the curb.) As she was getting out, I asked if I passed, and she said yes! I then rambled about how she's the best instructor ever (cringe). My poppaw was right outside the car, so he made some talk with her and I saw her mouth the words that I passed. He got up to my side of the car and I had this HUGE grin on my face. Then we hugged.\n\nI went back inside and stood at the front desk. I saw the photo lady from where I was and she saw me. She mouthed \"Did you get it?\" HUGE grin and mouthed \"Yes I got it!\" She gave me a thumbs up, and told me to have a seat. The old lady from the front desk saw our little circle of smiles and giggles and joined in lol. They were really nice, I couldn't have asked for better people to be there. The photo lady told me congrats but I was still twitching and she was like, \"Well you already have it now!\" I was just like \"I know, I dunno what's wrong with me! (lol)\"\n\nAnyway, I'm really happy right now. Me and Poppaw got some BK milkshakes and went home (he drove, he knew I was still freaking out). Ah, it was a good day.",
