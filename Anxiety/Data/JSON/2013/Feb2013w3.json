I've been trying to change that lately and get over this irrational fear. I've gotten slightly more comfortable in the past few months and decided its time to up the ante.\r\rTonight I went to a bar by myself, with no friends, no acquaintances, no crutch (not literally). I just found and empty seat at a bar and had a couple of beers. I didn't talk to anybody because I was still afraid. But at least I went god dammit.\r\rThis is a small victory and a first for me. Maybe next time I'll actually work up the courage to talk to somebody and have a decent conversation. Then maybe after that I'll make some friends and even meet a nice girl who's worth my time.\r\rIt was open mic night, and I just sat at the bar and enjoyed the music. I wasn't expecting anything to change my life tonight and it didn't. But at least I've taken this first step to HOPEFULLY bettering myself.\r\rHappy Valentines Day all and I hope my story helps you.\r\rEdit: Holy cow I didn't expect such a response. Thanks for the kind words everybody! If there's any advice I have, I would just say 2 words: Little Victories.",

Mainly I seem to do ok when there aren't many immediate things for me to worry about. I can handle the general worry about my future no problem, but whenever I start to have any sort of homework or responsibilities things start to get bad again. It's frustrating because I worry that in the future I'll never be able to handle the responsibilities of adulthood. If I can't handle homework now then I just don't see how anything is going to ever get better for me as I get older. I would appreciate any sort of feedback/advice. ",

            "selftext": "I struggle with general and social anxiety. The social anxiety has gotten better over the last few years, but I still have some difficulties, specifically with hyper-awareness and automatic thoughts. \n\nI've gotten better about putting myself out there when I want to be around people, but a lot of the time when I am with a group of friends, I feel like the black sheep; the one who isn't acknowledged as much as others, the one who feels left out of the inside jokes, you get my point. Last night was different, though. \n\nI live outside of DC, so after work, I went into DC with two of my friends to play trivia. Generally, with these two friends, it's easy for me to feel like a third wheel and withdraw from them because they have gotten closer in the last several months. Instead of withdrawing though, I faked it until I made myself feel like I was as included as I desired to be. While playing trivia, I felt like an integral part of the team and not just the tag-along. When we were all taking the metro back home, I noticed that my two friends were speaking to each other more than speaking to me; and while I noticed this and felt that certain discomfort I get when my anxiety is flaring, I was okay because for that moment *I didn't care*. I can't tell you the last time I found myself in a situation like that and just brushed it off. It was so incredible to just not care.\n\nSo when I finally got home with my roommate, I felt so light. I felt so engaging. I felt like *myself*. When my boyfriend came to stay with me at night, I didn't feel like I was holding back from him (I've been doing that lately because I've been having some pretty heavy anxiety for the last month). I just talked and held him and laughed with him, and it was the first time I felt that good around anyone in a what feels like ages. \n\nIt was honestly the most beautiful feeling I've felt in so long, and for once, I fully believed that I can actually take back control. This comes on top of me deciding to find some new hobbies to engage myself with, to go back to therapy to work on my coping skills, and to find a psychiatrist to see if I can get back on Celexa to help with my improvement. \n\nStill, it felt so incredible to not feel anxious, to not feel tense, and to not feel like something bad is going to happen and that I was the cause of it. I just wanted to document this so I wouldn't forget that moment and that feeling. ",

Well I was getting words/phrases stuck in my and decided to do some obsessive research to feed into my anxiety &gt;.&gt; and came across the disorder known as echolalia. Let it be clear that schizophrenia is among one of my greatest fears. It turns out that echolalia is a symptom of a form of schizo. So after reading about it, my brain decides to convince me that I have it. I can tell that I'm purposely \"acting\" like I have echolalia, even though I'm 100% sure I don't. The same thing is happening to me with hypnagogia. My brain keeps placing intruding thoughts in itself. It only happens when I think about it. It immediately goes away when I'm distracted. I guess I'm reaching that point where I'm noticing that it's all in my head and I'm finally understanding this anxiety disorder. Of course, this doesn't mean it's gone away lol. It's still there. But I'm at a point (at least today) where I don't give in to the \"what if's\". I'm reassuring myself that it's just my brain working itself up. And I know that conscious reassurance won't exactly fix the subconscious cluster-fuck that brain is creating, but I'm in the process of acquiring medical help, so I should be able to see a psychiatrist soon. Which means I can fix that. Anyway, I don't I'll bother making a TL;DR to this, so if you've read up to this point, thank you and you're awesome. Have a nice day :).",

So then I started getting anxious about how anxious I was feeling, of course. ;) By the time I'd gotten halfway through my squats, it was getting intrusive... and I had this strange part of my mind that seemed to *want* to be more upset.\n\nI've noticed that a lot before, and never understood it. Sometimes I've hated myself because how can I get better if I don't even want to? It seems so goddamn crazy. :/\n\nBut that day, something clicked: the reason part of me wanted to be more upset was because it wanted my fiance to *know* I was upset, so he could be extra nice to me and not trigger anything by accident. That part of my brain was too disconnected from the speech part to express anything in words, so it was using the only thing it could reach: emotions.\n\nSo, I walked over to my fiance and told him I wasn't doing well. I got a hug, and decided to continue with my squats. I still felt crappy, but it wasn't getting any *more* crappy.\n\nThen something really cool happened: I did my biggest squat for the day (130lbs - 10lbs more than I keep thinking of as my max) - and not only did I do well at it (5 reps, a new record) I felt *good* at the end. The anxiety just sorta melted away while I was busy putting all my attention into lifting. :) It felt so good, I went on and did an extra set, 135lbs for 4. :) :)\n\nI've always heard people talk about exercise making them feel really good, but I'd never felt that way myself until now.

            "selftext": "I've never been the type that one would call \"social.\" I really only have one close friend but I have many acquaintances. I am now a sophomore in high school. Last summer I didn't even contact anyone I know for a solid two months. I was doing very well in school for the entirety of my freshman year but that all changed. Once I got back in school my anxiety level skyrocketed. I've never experienced anything like it before. It went from zero anxiety to thinking I'm going to die anxiety in the span of 24 hours. For the first semester of this year, I did pretty well. I even made honor roll with a 4.1 GPA. This year it's a different story. I'm falling behind severely. I have an F in a class that I could easily have an A in but I just don't do anything in it. I don't understand anything that's going on in my math or chemistry classes and I have a D in chemistry. I feel like I have to choose between having decent grades and having a social life, because I can't handle both. Even now, I'm putting off doing something that I had 2 weeks to do. I'm so overcome with anxiety that I can barely make it through the whole school day. My meds seem to wear off as soon as I get home and I usually end up doing little to no homework. I know I can't blame anxiety for all my problems, and some of the blame has to rest on me. I've always been a chronic procrastinator and I think I'm just lazy. I know I could be doing well, but even if I was, I think I would just be alone all the time. Thankfully my dad is understanding of my situation, but not the severity of it. I don't know how to put into words what I'm going through, and I know it isn't as bad as I think it is, but right now I have no fucking idea where to go. I'm always worrying about the future because of my bad grades and bad decisions and the fact that I only have one friend. I could always try to get my grades up, but I don't know where to start. Should I tell my teachers about my problems or would they just shrug it off and tell me that I need to do my work. I'm not special, so why should I get special treatment. I feel like I physically cannot bring myself to do my homework, so I keep putting it off and putting it off until it's too late. I don't know what to do, I don't know where to turn. I try to cover all this up as best I can, because I'm actually a well liked person, and I don't want this to change the way people see me. I've always been \"that weird funny guy.\" I rarely exercise because when my heart rate elevates I begin to have massive amounts of anxiety. All I ever do is watch TV, browse the internet, and masturbate because those are the only things I'm good at. I'm so disorganized and I often forget about very important things. I don't know how I'm going to make it in the real world if I can't even handle high school. I don't want this to be normal. I want to go back to the way it was. When I was happy. Right now, I'm terrified of what the next day will bring. Of being stuck in the same old situation that I'm in now.",

I would be sitting in the room with him and his friend playing this game and then the sounds of shooting came, I couldn't handle it, and I had to leave the room. Fast-forward to the present, I can watch people FPS games no problem, but a couple weeks ago I tried to play Halo 4. It was all going fine, I was kinda nervous to start playing, maybe the idea of things shooting at me kinda set me off. We started playing in campaign mode and the controller started to vibrate and it really freaked me out. I couldn't even really focus on playing because I was too scared and nervous to even go forward. I tried playing for a few minutes but I felt overwhelmed and had to stop. I know this may seem silly, but I really don't even think i'm capable of playing these games because of how anxious they make me. ",
