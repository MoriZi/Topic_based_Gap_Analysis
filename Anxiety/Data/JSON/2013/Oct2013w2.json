            "selftext": "I'm 30 and I've had GAD/Social/Panic Disorder for 5 years. I'm on 30mg Paxil/day with a Klonopin holstered in my front-right pocket at all times, and I've had months where I could barely leave my house. I made [this](http://i.imgur.com/pHGZYB7.png) and [this](http://i.imgur.com/WsuhBnL.gif) which have been passed around in this sub. Anxiety is a big part of my life.\n\nI started running on May 5 of this year and it has helped a lot. I want to share 2 reasons why I think regular exercise has helped me, the 2nd of which is probably new to you (at least I haven't read it before).\n\n1.) There's the [science](http://well.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/07/03/how-exercise-can-calm-anxiety/?_r=0) behind it. Not only does exercise produce happy chemicals in abundance, it actually creates new neurons and conditions your brain to handle anxiety. Think about that.\n\n2.) If you suffer from panic attacks like I do, you're familiar with the awful chain reaction that usually starts them. Something will set off a physical reaction in your body\u2013either a quick shot of adrenaline, a swift increase in heart rate, or something like that\u2013and the domino effect begins. Your body says, \"Oh noes! Heart started beating faster! **PANIC ATTACK MODE: ENGAGED!**\" and the attack is set in motion. I've experienced this more times than I can count, and the worst feeling on earth is the helplessness you drown in when you know an attack is coming and nothing you can do will stop it. But here's the thing I realized: when your body is used to regular exercise, it will no longer automatically recognize these feelings as instant panic attack mode. Because when you exercise, your heart beats fast; your blood flows; you get light-headed. Your body gets used to these feelings.\n\nBefore I started exercising, my body reacted to these things with instant panic mode. Now, if something makes me light-headed, gives me a fast heart-beat, etc., my body says, \"Wait, I felt this same thing yesterday afternoon when I was running.\" It makes sense!\n\nI did not want to start running. I don't have time to run. I have two children (4 and 2) and another due this week. I frankly don't really care about all the other benefits of regular exercise. \n\nI run 3-4 times per week, anywhere from 1 to 2.5 miles. I run in the mornings, usually leaving the house at 6AM so I can get back before the kids wake my pregnant wife. I don't have the energy left at the end of the day to run after work.\n\nI am not a Mr. Motivational Happy Exercise Guy, telling you to go out and exercise to \"be your best, by golly!\"; I'm a guy who chose to try exercise as a last resort, and it has really helped. I implore you to give regular exercise a try for one month.  Ignore all the Facebook posts from your friends that say, \"WOOO I RAN 17 MILES TODAY IN 23 MINUTES!\" and just do something that makes you sweat, makes your heart beat fast, and gets blood pumping through your body and brain. Do it regularly to condition your body to get used to these physical stressors.\n\nSee if it helps you the way it has helped me. ",

Nothing at all; no love or hate or anything. They're just \"people\" that I can barely differentiate from strangers on the street.\n\n- I have a girlfriend, but she's been away for two months and the more time I spend away from her, the less I like her. It's gotten to the point where any interaction (mostly via chat/text) is an annoyance.\n\n- Even when I was with her, I was never sure if I was happy because I \"had a girlfriend\", or whether I actually liked her.\n\n- I'm scarily narcissistic and cutting people out of my life at an increasing rate. Every time I free myself from a person I feel closer to some bizarre form of happiness, and that scares me.\n\n- My number one desire right now is to just delete every human connection I have and start over, even though I know that none of my connections deserve that.

I also have social anxiety so that is just another reason to feel nervous about going anywhere alone.  After a long time avoiding it, I finally made it to the bus stop and sat down for a few minutes before getting up and going back home.  The trucks were passing by so fast I had to leave after a few minutes.  I guess it's a big step but it's hard for me to be pround of myself because I always have high expectations.

Creeping around corners and just expecting something to jump out and chase me leaves me soiling my pants. It's hard for me to understand how anyone could find them enjoyable!\n\nBut pretty much any first person game really gets me going. Games like Halo and Call of Duty use to make me feel so uncomfortable when I was younger, but I've gotten better with those. Games like Skyrim, Fallout, Far Cry and even minecraft(seriously me?) leave my heart pounding. I think overall the concept of things unexpectedly attacking me is what makes me anxious. And I loathe basically any situation where I'm timed/racing another character. I honestly want to enjoy them though, because they look so fun! I find them a bit easier to play when I'm with others, and I have no issues watching my friends and siblings play. That's usually what ends up happening anyway, or I watch play-throughs on youtube.\n\nNintendo games are what I find relaxing. I've grown up playing with their consoles and love the majority of their games. Anything with mario, animal crossing, harvest moon, pokemon, kirby, etc. are my fallback if I need to relieve some stress. PC games are great too.\n\nDoes anyone else experience anything similar? There are so many games with amazing concepts that I want to play, but I literally can't enjoy them! I don't understand why I get this way. Is there any way to get over this?\n\nAnd what are some of your fallback games that help you unwind when you're anxious? \n",

My work, school, and social life have all been affected.\n\nThis morning, though, something happened that is helping me feel a little better.  While taking a shower, my phone rang.  I instantly started worrying that someone had died.  After all, why else would my phone be ringing so early in the morning?  After a few moments, I thought, 'what a ridiculous conclusion to make!'  I was jumping to the worst possible conclusion just because my phone rang!\n\nThis probably seems obvious to a lot of you, but I decided to begin regulating my thoughts better.  I'm changing my thoughts of guilt and self doubt to encouragement and a feeling of deserving happiness.  I have spent the last 20 minutes giving myself a sort of mental pep talk and I feel much better than I did when I woke up.  I hope I can keep this going!\n\nJust wanted to share the story of my morning.  I hope that it might help a few of you too!",

            "selftext": "I'm in highschool and in one of my classes today I had to use the restroom. I asked my teacher if I could go use the restroom and she says yes. Unfortunately I had been having stomach problems that day and my digestive system would not allow me to hurry up and go back to class. After about 25 minutes I return to the class. My teacher stops her lecture and tells me in a calm but stern voice, \"take a seat, we'll discuss as to WHERE you were for the past 25 minutes after class.\" The bell rings and all students leave and she comes to ask me what I had been doing. Conversation in a nutshell:\n\nTeacher: \"So... where were you?\"\nMe: \"I was having stomach problems, that's why it took so long to come back.\"\nTeacher: \"oh so you went to the nurse?\"\nMe: \"No... I went to the bathroom... nature calls sometimes.\"\nTeacher: \"I get that. But you were not in the bathroom because I sent a student in to go check on you and you were not there.\" *there is a bathroom close to her room, but I decided to go to a different bathroom*\nMe: \"well I went to a different bathroom further down the hall.\"\nTeacher: \"So I'm supposed to believe you went to a different bathroom when there is a perfectly good one right there? I'm thinking of writing you up for just skipping class.\"\nMe: \"well the bathroom closest to your room... has no soap. the other one does.\" *seriously, there is no soap. the soap dispensers dont even have bags in them*\nTeacher: \"I'm not going to accept that 'no soap' excuse. I'll have to reconsider writing you up, but you can forget about going to the bathroom in my class from now on.\"\n\nHonestly, the whole event was hysterical because whilst sitting in the bathroom, I knew that this was going to happen. \nThe thing that bothered me is that when she was talking to me after class, my voice quivered, I got a knot in my throat, and I felt like crying. I didn't feel the need to cry, whilst I was speaking I kept asking myself, \"what the freak is going on. why am I about to cry...\"\n\nI talked to my mother and she said that as a child I always hated confrontation. Whenever somebody would confront me with the slightest anger I would get very timid and teary-eyed. I don't understand why though. I really didn't care that my teacher was mad at me, I had no reason to cry. I generally pride myself on always staying calm and clear headed, but my pride shot itself in the face with my reaction to her anger.\n\nWhy did my voice become more and more timid and why did I feel the need to cry? \nIs there any way I can stop this from ever happening again?\n\nTL;DR\nMy teacher confronts me angrily about skipping class when I had just gone to the bathroom because of stomach problems. While explaining, my voice quivers, my eyes become teary-eyed and I start to shake. I honestly didn't care that she was mad at me, but had no control over what was happening to me. why am I such a pansy and how do I stop being a pansy?\n\nAny insight is much appreciated. thank you. :)",

They suggested I try out the campus counseling to see if they can do such a thing (which I planned to do anyway for some recent life events).\n\nWell, I got to my initial evaluation, and got through it fine, having my life pretty much written out. **I walked in there for help with social anxiety and another recent traumatizing event.** I wait it out a while, then get a voicemail on my phone.\n\nThey said that unfortunately, I would be best off \"referred elsewhere\" \"because of the amount of Xanax\" I take, and \"the risks involved, although I know you know not to mix it with alcohol\". \n\nI couldn't get to my doctor in time to leave for college, and knew I'd need some sort of drug to knock me out of any inevitable panic attacks as I try to make friends and adjust. I did *extensive* research until I knew for sure that I had made the right choice and would be able to avoid dependence. That \"amount of Xanax\" I take? 0.25mg TOPS. Once or twice a week during the beginning of the semester, but now maybe twice a month at absolute most. I do everything I can to be responsible with my drug use, and only use it when *absolutely needed* (never to \"get fucked up\"), and I'm truly not at risk for anything - if I was, there's no way the tiny handful of pills would be hardly touched after almost 3 months. I can understand if they don't want to be held liable if I overdose or something, but I find this complete bullshit. I was VERY clear about all of this and thought complete honesty would be best in my situation. \n\nI feel like this was a kneejerk reaction to the scary word Xanax. I've said it before...just because there is a POTENTIAL for addiction doesn't mean that it will happen.\n\nMy health insurance is hours away and I doubt anything would be covered; on top of that, I can't tell my parents or have them pay for anything outside. This is my only option, and now I'm going to be fucked in my class that is 30% participation, because I can't give the disability office any answers. Does anyone know if I can fight this decision? I feel like it was very biased, especially considering I didn't go there for help with a drug problem I don't have. Sorry if this sounds pissy, because I still am.",

            "selftext": "It seems like there are a lot of people that have social anxiety that have to work through it because life demands it.  They might be the shy one around the office and they struggle with that, or maybe they're employed in such a way that work is tolerable but they're instead having problems coupling with someone.  It seems like in those situations there's at least some stasis, because there's income and you probably have a social contact or two as a result of employment.  I don't mean to downplay that at all, as that's sort of where I was all through school and shortly thereafter, and none of that was even remotely easy for me.  Obligation places you with people, as uncomfortable as that may be.  What I see for myself now is a bit different though, and I'd like to hear if others can relate.  \n\nBasically, the idea of going through the application and interviewing process or engaging in anything that remotely resembles *normal living* is totally daunting to me.  The thing that really scares me is the fact that real employment not only seems far-fetched, but that it gets further and further from reality on a daily basis.  Where will that put me in 3, 5, or 10 years?  I'm not suicidal right now, but I can't even imagine being alive that far down the road.\n\nI have degrees in math and computer science and I have a couple of actuarial exams under my belt, but I'm now 28 years old and I haven't had a real interview in my entire life.  I worked for a couple of years at the university as a programmer thanks to a friendly connection (who I lost).  After that, I started working in my father's business, but he's now on partial retirement and the amount of work I do is basically enough to cover room, food, therapy, and the minimum payment on my student loans.  It's so little work now that my paycheck feels like more of an allowance than anything else.\n\nSo I've had some strange combination of avoidance and entitlement (as exemplified by my current \"employment\" situation).  If I ever had a problem, I had my parents to fall back on and they've accepted me with open arms.  I realize that's a hard thing to sympathize with.  Loving parents?  Who does this guy think he is to complain about having it difficult?  They may be *generous* and I've always been appreciative of that, but their generosity totally enabled me to get out of doing things that were even remotely scary as a kid, and now I can't figure out how to handle real life.  \n\nNow I'm just stuck in complete social withdrawal.  I'm a hikikomori.  My therapist has me taking baby steps like getting out and trying to meet people, but my feelings of shame are every bit as strong as my anxieties, and all of these assignments leave me feeling disappointed.  I don't go into a full panic when I speak (though I'm very shy), but I have a hard time letting people get to know me because I'm just so utterly ashamed about the person I've become.  I'm awkward, depressed, and I feel like I'm unemployable.  \n\nI spend a lot of my time working on myself, whether it's studying for more actuarial exams, writing software, or even exercising, but with all my anxieties I feel like my mind is operating at maybe 40% capacity.  Deep down, I also *know* that I'm just using these things in order to trick myself into thinking I'm making progress, when the only real progress would be to start living life somehow.  But... I just can't seem to do it.\n\n**tl;dr** - Stuck in an unsustainable, withdrawn lifestyle with an inability to change it.",
