            "selftext": "So for backstory, I work at a store where I went from being inventory (minimal interaction) to being a cashier (lots of interaction and I have to touch money). I have switched my medication from Prozac to Zoloft, and because it works a thousand times better for me, I've been able to preform in this job and face my fears. It's been a great experience, although it's definitely more draining than my last job. I have the highest customer feedback scores! There have been a couple times where I needed to excuse myself because somebody started shouting and have a small panic attack in the bathroom, but most of my supervisors understand.\n\nA couple nights ago I was working the night shift, and this particular night was slow, so not all cashiers were needed on the floor. He calls me over to the cashier station, which is an unused register, and starts asking me questions about my car. What kind of car it is, how many miles is on it, what condition it's in, etc etc. I thought this was weird, but I couldn't find the voice to say that these questions were making me uncomfortable or even ask why he was asking, so I answered his questions. Maybe he's trying to kill time, I reasoned. He then says \"Come on, let's go outside and have a look\" and being that it's slow anyway and fresh air is always nice, I agree. He walks around my car, inspecting it, and asks more questions. He explains that his wife is learning how to drive and that they need two cars so that he can drive to work and she can drive around the kids. He asks me how soon I can sell it, and being too far into this conversation to back out now, I tell him that I need to do some shopping around, but probably within the next couple months. He asks how much I want for the car, I say that I need to get an assessment from Carmax and that I'd let him know. At this point he's really happy, he doesn't feel comfortable about buying a car from a stranger and tells me that his wife will be so happy to hear that they've found someone willing to sell them a car. The rest of the night, he's periodically gushing about the whole deal while I try to figure out what I just agreed to.\n\nGuys, I don't want to sell my car. It's completely paid off and runs awesome. I have no idea what to do. When telling this story to a friend, he pointed out that he was very rude in trying to pressure me into this, but I think that maybe because he's from Yugoslavia, he doesn't understand our customs yet? I feel like I'm really the one to blame. As a child I was abused, and as a result, I have a very hard time saying no. This has landed me into doing some things I'm not proud of in the past, and I don't want to let this happen again. I can't just avoid him like I normally might do in an uncomfortable situation, because he's one of my bosses. I'm scared that if I back out, then he will resent me and it will affect my job. I'm also horribly scared of conflict. I also have no idea why he chose me to ask. I looked around everywhere for a sign or something from someone trying to sell a car, and haven't found anything. I'm not sure that he could have chosen me because of my anxiety, because I've really only been working this position for a month. What do?",

            "selftext": "It was okay last year because I lived on campus. I was living with two other girls who were in the same course so we walked to classes together sometimes, but they mostly stuck together just the two of them. Everything was in reach, I could hop to and from the library whenever I wanted and it was no problem running back to my flat for a nap between classes if I had the time. I made some friends too but I ended up not liking them very much. There was a bit of drama so I was switching between who to sit with in classes, then the one I stayed with most starting hanging with another group who I didn't know and excluded me, and the other friends were already close enough together, so I just felt like I tagged along behind them. Towards the end, I kind of fell away from them all. Well I texted one a few times over summer but I still don't like him very much, and spoke to another one only once. She wanted some information about something and never continued the conversation once I gave it to her.\n\nSo none of those friends stuck and no friends from home go to the same university, so I would say I'm alone this year. And I'm absolutely terrified.\n\nI can't do things on my own, I start panicking badly. I have to travel in for nearly an hour and I'll start crying on the way. Uni starts back in three days and we don't have our personalised timetables yet so I have no idea which classes I definitely need to attend. When I sit in lectures, where am I supposed to go? Just sit by myself down the front? What if some of the friends still expect me to sit with them and think I'm rudely ignoring them? And seminars are worse, we're expected to DISCUSS. I *do not* talk in class. And who do I sit with in there? People are all already friends with each other. And I'll probably forget where all my classes are too.\n\nPlus, since I don't live on campus anymore, I'll have to find a way to fill time between classes. I can go to the library but it's always hella busy, and I'm not very good at studying anyway so I'd just be sitting on facebook/tumblr/reddit. Then I'd probably lose track of time and miss class/turn up late. I was late to ONE class last year and although nothing came of it, I was incredibly embarrassed. Or, again, what if those friends expect me to hang out with them? They sit in the on-campus bar and I hate the on-campus bar, and I can't order from the cafe or buy from the shop. Which also means I'll have to drag a load of food with me and if I forget one morning, I'll be hungry all day.\n\nThis has turned into a huge venting post, I'm sorry, these are all really stupid things. God I'm so so scared, I don't wanna go back.\n\nEdit: Our personal timetables were just released, I'm a little bit calmer now.",

Last year was a really tough year for me, so my grades in this class were pretty terrible. Starting a new semester means I have to study even harder to catch up to my peers, but every time I try and study I have to fight my anxiety head on. I constantly second guess myself, I can't concentrate, and I start feeling depressed and hopeless when I don't understand something.\n\nI do understand why this particular class is a big trigger for me, and it's mostly because of how stupid I feel in it. Other than this class I do really well in my other subjects, but I end up feeling like a failure when I'm confused in this class, which is all the time.\n\nI'm making attempts to reach out to classmates, though getting through social anxiety takes time. Talking with my instructors only makes me feel worse. If they are offering tutoring I'm planning to go, but if they don't I'm not sure what I can do. \n\nIn a nutshell, I need to pass this class (plus another semester) to graduate, but my anxiety is making it very difficult and I'm not sure what to do.

I get occasional chest pains but my heart has been checked so many times with nothing wrong. Pains in my abdomen are always followed by a few hours searching the web for things like liver disease or other frightening conditions...which just makes it worse. I've recently had a few days of extreme fatigue which could be caused by so many deadly conditions. How do I stop convincing myself that I have these things.

            "selftext": "(this is a crosspost from the body acceptance subreddit - I hope that's okay)\n\nHi everyone,\n\nThis is my first post on reddit, I hope I'm doing it right. I'm a 25 year old guy, and for the last couple of years I have struggled with depression and social anxiety. The main cause of all that: when I was 15 I was in an accident which partly burned my face. It healed to a certain extent in that I don't look like your typical burn victim, but there are a lot of smaller cuts. My skin is very pale (it doesn't tan in sunlight at all), I have very deep, almost black, permanent bags under my eyes and there isn't a single spot on my face that's smooth or clear. I basically look like a meth addict all the time, which is often how people treat me. I've been told that most people look past the scars, and while that may be true for a lot of people, I meet people almost every day who feel the need to comment on it in a very hurtful way, as if it's my own fault that I look like this. This has been going on for years now, and I honestly can't go on like this anymore. I'm becoming more and more withdrawn, more and more stuck in my own head. The realisation that I'm going to be alone forever - which I always knew - is really hitting me hard these days, now that everyone in my age group is ending up in long-term relationships, moving in together, having children. Everyone is living their life, and I can't even leave the house without looking at myself in the mirror for hours (which often leads to me just staying inside after all). I used to be fairly social besides these issues, but these days I honestly feel disgusting when I'm outside all the time. I look at myself in every reflection, notice everyone who's looking at me when I'm walking around. My social skills are deteriorating, and I'm very, very afraid where my mind is going while I'm alone in my flat every evening. I feel like I'm locked in a prison, and the older I'm getting, the more unlikely it seems that I'll ever get out of it. In fact, it seems to be getting worse every day.\n\nAnyway, I need to change something. I literally can't take another day of sitting around, mindlessly surfing the internet, breaking down crying, hating myself. Obviously I tried to fix myself in the past through various remedies, but nothing ever worked. These days I can't even force myself to go outside to excercise because I just can't stand people watching me, laughing behind my back anymore, which leads to me gaining weight. I'm not exactly fat right now, although I definitely have to much fat around my stomach-area and I certainly lack muscles (again, way too self-conscious to go to the gym. Previous attempts to go ended in my being laughed at in such a condescending manner that it's not even an option for me anymore). I'm so, so tired of being always being the ugliest person wherever I go.\n\nI don't even know what I'm really asking here. I just hope someone out there (who maybe went through something similar) can give some practical advice. I know therapy is probably something that's going to be suggested a lot, and I do agree that I need it, but I simply can't afford it right now. \n\nI feel like the biggest loser in the world. I hope someone can help. I need to break out of this loneliness before I go completely insane (which, I sometimes wonder, I might already be).\n\n[b]tl;dr: Had accident when I was younger which permanently scarred my face, now unable to leave the house and live my life.

I love the work, but I can't overcome that constant anxiety. \n\nIt's getting really old, getting hopes up like this just to let myself down. That roar in my head wont shut up and it doesn't get better in time, it just gets louder. I can't keep torturing myself like this, I'm tired of the shaking, going to the bathroom to puke every hour, the constant worry. I don't even know what the hell I'm worried about, even when I breathe and talk myself through it, the anxiety wont fuck off.\n\nI'm tired, and feel hopeless.

I was actually looking forward to going because i've managed to make friends with most of the people i work with. Anyway, on the night, my dad came home from a month long business trip and was only here for a few days before leaving again. So, i chose to have dinner with him and my mum instead without telling anyone at work....It seems this was a terrible idea because now the guy who organised the party has started being really, really mean to me at work (he's a level above me, but not the absolute boss) and my anxiety has taken a turn for the worst. I've started getting panic attacks again (about 2 a day on average) and i've started shaking before i have a shift with him. I've even thought about crashing my car on the way to work so i don't have to deal with him (Just realised i have one tonight! YAY!)  \n\n\nI don't really want to talk to his boss because i'm convinced that will make it worse. Any suggestions on how to handle this?",

I had a bit of a panic attack on the airplane and have been subject to a pervading sense of hopelessness since then. I even cried which I honestly didn't know I was capable of. Not because of resolute bravery, but because I have become a master of suppressing the impulse.\n\nI finally made it here, moved into my dormitory, and now I'm alone. I feel miserable. An ocean is separating me from literally every person I know and instead of the way it was before, where I could use friends and family to help me in doing certain things, I am now in charge of absolutely everything.\n\nI'm hungry, but I can't bring myself to go get food for fear of being judged I guess. Walking down the streets is harrowing. Every step feels scrutinized. I'll have to meet my roommates soon when they get here which is making me anxious and then there is the prospect of making friends, going out, socializing with girls, being safe, finding my classes, and actually being in my classes (hopefully no class participation).  \n\nAt home I could manage dealing with anxiety and social anxiety because everything was familiar to me and my home felt safe. Now, I recognize nothing. I can't bring myself to look anyone in the eye and if I did, it wouldn't bring me any comfort. I drastically underestimated how excruciating and lonely this process would be. \n\nDo I back out? Waste a bunch of money and slink home like a coward? The relief would substantial and I can't stop fantasizing about it. Or do I ride it out? Will things get better or will I just continue to tax my mental health?",

            "selftext": "I know everyone is different, but what I experience doesn't seem like a \"typical\" anxiety attack from what I've read online, but I'm not sure what else it could be.  \nGenerally it happens when I'm walking as I usually go for long walks every evening, and its often the one time in the day I can really think and process things. I'm a pretty big introvert, so my walks tend to be something I look forward to as they are a time when I can really be alone and recharge. Last winter I was going through a really rough time and I started having these little incidents. Basically I'll have a memory. It's generally something that has no bearing on my present state, that's not really that big of a deal. The memory hits me and i feel an acute embarrassment, although embarrassment might not be the right word, even if it wasn't even that embarrassing when it actually happened.  Then there's a \"climax\" where the feeling peaks and I have a physical reaction to it. I contort my face into a grimace and my neck muscles tighten.  I think I read something a long time ago that the act of smiling can release chemicals into your brain that make you feel happy because your brain associates smiling with being happy. As a result, I've gotten in the habit of trying to smile to counteract the grimace which results in me making all sorts of odd facial contortions.  This whole thing happens in a span of probably 2 seconds. It tends to be cyclical and will happen a couple times in a row or sometimes just once or twice. It doesn't really happen randomly at work or school or anything- mostly just when I am out for a walk and have time to think. It got bad enough for a while that it was just happening so much, that I stopped going on my beloved walks, but eventually as I got the rest of my life a little more in order, they went away completely.  Now they're back. Is this anxiety? I know putting a label doesn't really change what's happening, but it'll help me figure out how to deal with it perhaps.  \nThanks for taking the time to read this.
