I failed the two other times partially because of how poorly I handle tests when my anxiety is high. Today I passed! I can now buy a car and drive alone (went from a G1 to G2 for anyone in Ontario). \n\nHurray for perseverance! \n\nEdit: Thank you everyone! I've responded a bit in comments but just as an FYI: I'm not a nervous driver, I used to be and was TERRIBLE at driving. I paid a lot for private lessons, practiced with friends and family so much and now can actually enjoy driving. I conquer anxiety and learn best when left alone and allowed to practice/try things out on my own...which isn't an option when you just have your G1, so I feel like my driving will get so much better now that I can drive alone.

            "selftext": "Hi r/Anxiety!  I've posted here a couple times with questions and asking for advice, and you've always been wonderful and so helpful.  If anyone is reading this that feels uncomfortable asking for help or advice, this is a really great place to start.  Everyone is so supportive and non-judgemental!\n\n\nI felt uncomfortable with the idea of therapy for my anxiety for a long time.  I've been pretty functional most of my life, and even when my anxiety starting getting worse about 6 months ago, I still worried that it \"wasn't bad enough\" to warrant professional help.  I was worried that maybe my anxiety wasn't that bad, and that it was just a character flaw that I couldn't deal with stressful things.  But, that was what I've deemed \"anxiety brain\" was seeing.  In the real world, I was crying and panicking almost every morning that I had to go to my easy part time job.  Physically, I was having trouble sleeping, my shoulders always ached, my bowels were almost never happy, and I could feel my heart often doing strange things.  Just because I could get myself out the door and continue with life didn't mean everything was okay.\n\n\nSo, I finally got into therapy after putting it off for several months.  We agreed to try therapy alone first, and that if it wasn't helping she would refer me to someone to talk about medication.  I mention this because I've seen some people here are often worried that getting help means you are going to be put on meds.  Not necessarily!  Meds are incredibly helpful for some people, but the worry about having to take meds should not keep you from asking for help!  \n\n\nI saw a therapist once a week for about 4 months, and she feels like I'm doing well enough to stop for now.  With the added note that I can always call if I'm having trouble and want a \"tune up\" session = ).  I've been feeling better, and it was really validating to hear it from her too!  I'm come to terms with the fact that I'm never going to be anxiety free.  But, seeing a therapist really helped give me better tools to deal with it as it comes.  I still feel like I'm more anxious than the average person, but it doesn't bog me down like it used to.  So last I wanted to add some things that I feel like really helped me.\n\n1. Therapy.  Literally, this is the number 1 thing that helped.\n\n2. Keeping a regular sleep schedule.\n\n3. Meditation, on a regular basis and as-needed when I start feeling the anxiety creep up.\n\n4. Keeping a journal.  Writing down my anxious thoughts helps get them out of my head.  And then, it's easier to challenge those thoughts and turn them around.\n\n5. Finding things to look forward to.  I expended a ton of energy on negative things, so I have been trying to replace it to positive things.  I plan short day trips to new places.  I look up fun diy projects that I want to do.  Little things still count!\n\n6. I drink a lot of hot tea.  Sometimes specifically \"relaxing\" or \"anti-anxiety\" labeled teas.  But I honestly also just enjoy the process of making and drinking tea.  I have my own little teapot, and I sit down with it and keep pouring myself tea.  It's lovely = )\n\n7. Exercise.  Even just walking.  It always felt to me like I was burning up some sort of anxiety chemical along with the calories.\n\n8. Podcasts.  I love podcasts.  [Mental Illness Happy Hour](http://mentalpod.com/) is a great one that specifically addresses mental illness, but in an easy going, often comedic way.  I also really love [You Made it Weird](http://www.nerdist.com/podcast/you-made-it-weird/).  It's much more comedy focused, but the host Pete Holmes often talks about his experiences with therapy, and sometimes the guests do as well.  Just hearing people talk about it sort of normalized it for me, and made it seem less scary.  Plus Pete Holmes is hilarious, and laughing always makes me feel better!\n\nThat feels really long winded, but I hope it was at least a little helpful for anyone!  If anyone has any questions I'm happy to answer. \n\nEDIT: Just wanted to add one more thing.  After having a low paying part time job for a long time, I just scored an interview for my ideal job!  I wasn't looking for a new job for a long time, because the thought of all the steps I had to do and all the new people I had to talk to made me incredibly nervous.  But I finally got the motivation and gumption to start looking again, and it was actually through networking and talking to people that I got the interview!  I'm hella nervous, but that just means I'll get some good meditation practice in and drink a lot of tea between now and then = )\n\n",

I just don't know how to classify my symptoms. \n\nI have weeks where I just cry for countless hours for no reason... I'm obviously unhappy, but I feel really anxious too at those times and Ativan usually helps me a little. Is anyone else like this? I'm just not sure if it's bouts of anxiety that make me feel depressed or depression that brings on anxiety. I want to know because I get asked whether I feel more depressed or anxious and to rate them on a scale of one to ten, and I don't know how to do that. Clearly I'm not very good at identifying my feelings haha. Thanks.",

            "selftext": "I lost another job. I can't believe it. Everyone that knows me has lost faith. I fell in love three years a go, and we've been incredibly happy. The relationship I had before him was abusive. Him and his best friend raped me. It took me so long to trust. I finally found my true love and he doesn't even know if he wants to be with me any more because of my anxiety. We were planning on moving away and starting a life together. We had it all figured out and for the first time in my life I experienced hope. Now I have nothing. I'm forced to live with my abusive parents. They scream and tell me everything is my fault and I brought it on my self. They've lost patience and are kicking me out. I have no friends. Before I met my boyfriend I didn't have a voice. The people I went to school with thought I was mute. I have no place to go. Today after I told my dad what happened he kept telling me it was my fault. I lost it. I was screaming on the top of my lungs that \"it's not my fucking fault\" and that I hate him. I slammed the door, locked myself in and started screaming so I couldn't hear him. I took my nails and was just scratching myself hard and hysterically crying and screaming. I've never done anything like this before. If I had a gun I would have pulled the trigger. I have no way out. I have no one to take care of me. I can't take care of myself. There is no way up from here. I've spent 10 years disabled and it's controlled my life and made me miserable. I have nothing.",

            "selftext": "I almost posted this in ADHD because that's what I thought my problem was until I evaluated myself against symptom lists.  But I think r/anxiety is probably more appropriate at this point.\n\nI've talked to my GP a number of times, we made a few conclusions, tried a few treatments (none for ADHD, just depression, insomnia, anxiety because she thinks lack of focus is directly related to my depression and anxiety) but the one lingering issue I have is a total inability to focus on my schoolwork.  It feels like my brain utterly rejects focusing on it, and is almost painful, definitely very uncomfortable for me to try.  It's boring, sure, most of the reading could be summarized from a chapter to a paragraph, and I feel almost insulted that the writer thinks it takes that much text to get the reader to understand.  But it's school, and this is how school is.  Exciting hands-on learning is just not part of the equation.  Adults in college/technical schools don't get Montessori treatment.   I've never been able to focus on textbooks, but I will absolutely devour a good novel or the internet.  \n\nWhat I'm getting at, is what else is there that I could be looking for?  Or where do I go from here as far as doctors?  I think I have gotten all I can out of my GP.\n\nI don't meet much of the ADHD criteria except for the total inability to focus.  I don't forget things, I'm well organized...  my brain just shuts down when I try to read textbooks and I feel SO DUMB.  My close friends keep telling me I just have to get over it or quit procrastinating.  They don't believe me when I say there is physical discomfort involved.  I need to do this stupid assignment but I'd practically rather chop 5 pounds of onions than read the textbook right now.  And even if I do trudge my way through today, I have another assignment due tomorrow, and Sunday, so on and so forth.  I have no idea what to do with myself right now.  If I open the book again I will probably burst out crying.",

            "selftext": "I am a 21 year old male and for the past year and a half depression and anxiety have begun ruining my life. Both have gotten progressively worse as time has gone on to the point where I feel confined to my room every day to either watch tv shows or play video games, with the only exception being leaving for part time work and playing / training for my local sports team.  \n\nI have a large group of close knit friends who I speak and hang out with daily yet even though I don\u2019t think they notice I feel as if I haven\u2019t truly been close to any of them since this started. They often talk to or confide in me yet I never truly reciprocate. They have no idea what is going on with me and would probably laugh and disregard it if they ever were to find out as they see me as a normal person, but as many of depression and anxiety sufferers know you become a master of deception to those closest to you. In front of all those closest to me I feel like I have created a buffer to stop people seeing how vulnerable I really am. People would see me as normal outgoing and quite shy yet not to the point of being strange, however keeping this up can be exhausting. We go out regularly to clubs / bars etc, yet I have begun to attend less lately, using last minute excuses such as lack of money/ work in the morning. Getting drunk is fine to momentarily relieve yourself of anxiety but in the following days it only worsens. \n\nI am currently in my 2nd college where I study software engineering. Initially I loved everything to do with the course however I attend so infrequently now that the feeling of being behind the curve has dulled my interest in the subject. My anxiety is so bad that the short 20 minute walk to my university is beyond a daunting task, every shuffle of an eyelid in my direction brings a fresh wave of worry across my mind. By the time I arrive at college my brain is exhausted from it. My college friends have grown tired of my excuses (Work, sickness etc.) and have begun seeing me as a \u201cwaster\u201d even though I am quite academic and achieved top marks in my first year. However my grades have begun to drop, I have missed countless lab exams and failed to hand in assignments due to waking up on days where my anxiety got the better of me and I couldn\u2019t leave the house. Explaining to them, \u201cohh I forgot about that one \u201d ,when they ask how I got on with the latest project is soul destroying for me. I will most likely still pass my exams but will not achieve the top grades I need to attract very good job offers. In terms of concentration my mind often feels \u201cfrazzled\u201d from all the worry and this also affects me academically.\n\nI have noticed my depression and anxiety come in cycles, whereby I mean they ease for short periods (maybe 2 weeks). In these periods I become extremely productive (For example, regular gym going along with massive amounts of efficient studying). Also at these times sleep will be reduced to 3 maybe 4 hours a night with no adverse effects during the day, in contrast to the norm these days where I may need 9 or 10 hours sleep and still be tired the next day. These \u201cgolden\u201d two week periods are becoming more infrequent as my depression and anxiety worsen.\n\nI feel suicidal often yet am reluctant as I recently had a cousin take her own life. I wasn\u2019t particularly close to her or that side of my family, yet I saw first hand the devastation her death  caused to my family. I don\u2019t wish to  cause further hurt to my family and re-open the scab over that wound.\n\nAs for getting help, one of the most repeated pieces of advice seems to be to open up to someone close to you. However I am utterly incapable of doing this out of fear of their reaction.  As for going to my GP, who I know quite well, I fear he would instantly see how far I have dropped and prescribe me medication ,therapy etc. My brother is in the medical field and would have access to my medical records, and I could not face him putting the dots together in that way. So I now feel trapped with no way out.\n\nPosting this in an online forum full of strangers is the closest thing to getting help I feel capable of doing. Even now I worry how anyone who reads this will see me even though we are all strangers and my username is the only thing you know about me..  \n",

            "selftext": "I wanted to take a moment to write this out. Perhaps as a way to heal or maybe to make a little ripple in this pond we call the Internet. I have battled with panic attacks since I was seven...the heart pounding, fist clenching, teeth numbing sort of attacks. Most of the time these attacks happened in private while my family was just trying to figure out why I suddenly went \"away\". However there were times, those horrible times, when it wasn't just my family. \nAs a girl one of the greatest pleasures as a child is the all important sleepover. Those nights of character pajamas and silly dares...you know...girl stuff. Those are the nights when best friendships are declared and you find out all the crucial life lessons. Add anxiety to the mix however and it might as well turn into social suicide. I had a moment like that. They were my best friends...we had laughed...made cookies...shared our secrets...then bed time came and in an instant it was as if I was hanging from the edge of a cliff, my fingers slipping with each passing breath. I collapsed into a recliner and began to panic...spinning out of control like a car on ice. They screamed...they called my mom...I left and the next day...I was in social Siberia. On that day I lost all the friends I had to snide remarks and sidelong glances and realized that I would never have 'bffs' again. It felt like I had died and was left as a husk of a little girl. Eventually new girls would ask me to come stay the night and it was always the same....\"no...I'm sorry...it's complicated.\" \nSo that was my life...even now strange places take me back to that cliff edge and I'm still working on pushing myself a little more. Anxiety is the monster under all of our beds...the unknown enemy who knows exactly what we are afraid of...but we fight on.",
