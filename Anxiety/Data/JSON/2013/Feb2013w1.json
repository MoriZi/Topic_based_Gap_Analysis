I'm just really proud of myself because it's something I've been trying to get myself to do since about November. The process itself was painful because I had to call (something I detest with every fiber of my being) and then I got transferred because I called the wrong number (which of course made me feel stupid and I should have known because it was on the website and how am I supposed to make it in this world if I can't do the most basic things...insert the spiral of self-loathing) and the phone call was long because it took the person I was talking to and me a while to figure out a day that works. But now that it's over I'm feeling slightly better. Of course now I have to worry about what I'm going to say/what will they think/are they going to think I'm making this up? \n\nAnyway, thanks to anyone who read this. I just wanted to get that off my chest. \n\nEdit: Thank you all so much for your kind words! ",

I didn't expect such a response.  I feel the need to explain what brought me to the thoughts above.  I have agoraphobia and panic disorder, and was recently diagnosed with bipolar 2.  I counted it up today and realized that I had my first symptoms over 30 years ago, and that in the pat 10 years it's gotten worse, very quickly.  I've been on many, many medications and am on 3 right now.  Nothing seems to have helped as far as medications go, so I am trying to find a Skype psychologist.  I think I need more than just popping pills.  I was once a musician and performed before many people.  Now I'm nowhere near that.  But it's people like you all that remind me that it could be possible to get back to that place.  So THANK YOU!",

I can even be outgoing sometimes. \n\nWhat I am having trouble overcoming is this anxiety and overthinking that I do before a scheduled event. It is particularly bad with work stuff. I have low self-esteem, compounded by an emotionally abusive family. I struggle to get out and try things, even though I *know* that I'll do fine. \n\nFor example, I'm a photographer. I will book a gig, and get nervous about how well I will do. I ruminate about it and the fear builds. When the time comes, I will often panic and cancel, or even just not show up. You can imagine how devastating this can be to a career. I did the same thing in college - I got a number of failing grades because I stopped showing up, due to a fear of some kind of embarrassment or catastrophe. It has kept me from coming anywhere near my potential in life. \n\nAny ideas on what exactly this is, or what to do about it? I'm seeing a psychiatrist, but she isn't helping me much with it. I've been in therapy for years for depression and anxiety and substance abuse, but this issue is very pervasive. \n\nTIA!",

But my husband recently got a new job that requires use or our only car and I knew I'd have to suck it up and be brave sooner or later or I'd be stuck at home for 5 hours a day for 5 days out of the week which would also drive me insane. \n\nToday I think I had an extra dose of bravery in my Cheerios because I decided to finally take the bus to go out. I was a bit anxious making sure I got off at the right stops but it was actually really easy and turned out to be fun too! I did get off at one of my stops too early but I only had to walk a tiny bit extra so it was no big deal. And going home will be just as easy. \n\nI just wanted to share this with a group of people who would understand and possibly encourage someone else to do something they've been a bit scared of too. It may turn out to be really fun like my experience! I met a cool guy and had some good conversations. :)\n\nBut an important little part of my story here was that I wasn't forced to do this. I didn't have to go out today. (I just wanted to go grab coffee since I've been sick and away from my favorite coffee place for too long.) Sometimes, our best victories are the ones we don't need to have. We just want to. And honestly, those feel the most satisfying and empowering to me. \n\nHave a great day everyone! :) ",

I try to remain positive, and I started to incorporate meditation, but I severely lack confidence and it leads to my anxiety.\n\nAfter I got back from work, I told my boyfriend about my awful day and how I think I should probably see a therapist. He always tries to cheer me up and tell me that things are not a big of a deal as they seem, but I can't see it that way.\n\nI'm usually a very friendly person, to the point that I want to make sure that everyone is happy and that they like me. Since I have no confidence, I always imagine that people don't really like me and that they're just being friendly to my face. This leads me to think so much into every remark and I worry that I annoy others. \n\nThe other night at work I was working with two other coworkers. Our office has a dividing wall (You can still hear everything in the small office). We usually sit in the front end to chat during the downtime. At the end of the night, I went to go to the other side to put some stuff away. It was silent and then there was the sound of one coworker laughing as they were reacting to what the other was doing/saying. I didn't hear anything. Of course, I beat myself down and instantly imagine that one of the coworkers was mouthing or miming something to do with me.When I go back, everything seems to be normal.\n\nMost likely it was nothing- a coworker reacting to a text message or something, but I always go straight for the negative. I try my best to be friendly, but I always imagine that it just blows up in my face.\n\nI couldn't sleep last night. I just went through everything that could possibly be wrong with me. I thought about everything. Maybe I smell bad? Maybe they think I'm crazy? Maybe they think I'm a bitch? Maybe they think I'm stupid? My boyfriend just thinks I'm silly and says that he can't imagine that they would think those things.\n\nThis anxiety ruins my life. I can't think clearly because of it. I become emotional and will shut down if I just suspect that I'm not welcome in any given group. \n\nI will admit that I'm on my period, so problems may be magnified at the moment. I wonder if it's also a bit of seasonal depression. I've also been unhappy with juggling two part time jobs, and I haven't had a vacation in a long time. The list goes on.\n\nMy boyfriend says that most people don't really go out of their way to hate other people. I always see the good in people, and I only see my own fuck ups.\n\nI just needed to get this out of my system.\n\n",

            "selftext": "Hi r/anxiety. \n\nMy happiness rating over the last month or so has gone from a 2 or a 3 to about a 7 or 8. I know that anxiety comes in many different forms but I wanted to share some thoughts here in the hope that it will help someone. \n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMUiwTubYu0\n\nI was watching this a while back and thinking about how true this was.  \nExcept, it isn't just a ride, because you have control over it. I have heard the phrase \"Don't take life too seriously\" many times in my life, but never before have I really understood it. I say understood because, it's not as though I didn't agree with the message of it, I just didn't know how people did it. I started to say to myself, \"It's just a game\", just like any of the video games I love to play. \n\nNow, I suppose this will apply more to the people who aren't religious here... but I started taking solace in the fact that my life is insignificant. I can live it any way I want, and I don't want to live it anxious and depressed. \n\nNow, I have been taking Viibryd for a while, so that may be contributing quite a bit as well, but I feel as though my perspective shift was very helpful as well. I imagined all the horrible things that could happen and then my perspective on life popped in and said \"oh well\". \n\nHere's an example: as I was writing this, I was worried for a second that people would read this and say \"You're obviously just feeling the meds\" or \"why can't I feel like that?\".\n\nI guess I just see the anxious thoughts now and go \"yeah, but I'm still gonna post it. Why not? Let's see what happens. Maybe this post will be seen by friends/family, maybe it'l pop up 10 years from now in a job interview, but whatever.\"\n\ntl;dr, perspective changes on life can affect your subconscious and let you worry a little without caring about the worrying. \n\nHope this helps.

I immediately yelled \"What the FUCK!\" ( which is embarrassing because I am holding a small infant ) and all she did was laugh and say sorry with a stupid smile..and continued driving. Jesus Christ, she didn't seem to care at all that she almost hit us.  I started hyper ventilating and kept trying to calm myself down. Apparently I was so visibly upset that strangers were trying to get me to sit down and drink water. Is this normal? \n\nI have to pump myself up when I go to leave the house. It takes a bit for me to finally talk myself into going outside for whatever reason. So this jut freaked me out. Why did it make me so upset, angry to the point of feeling light headed and having chest pains. Is this normal? Was I just upset about my son possibly getting hurt? How do I calm myself down quickly so that I don't start acting weird in public.  It just seems excessive that I was so shook by it I wanted to cry and my legs wanted to buckle. Like my body is being overly dramatic. Why couldn't I have just been angry at those stupid girls and just moved on...",

I would like there to be a reason but it was just a break from the cycle. I was able to talk to people I hardly know about things I don't know a lot about.

This Friday, a friend grabbed my breast. I did not grant him consent, and he felt no remorse. I told him I didn't like it. He then made me feel bad about it, saying that I wasn't grateful for having big breasts, and that I should be. At first, I numbed the thought, thinking that it would go away if I acted like nothing happened. That night, I started freaking out, having a panic attack. I didn't know why until I thought about it. The next day I told my therapist, and that helped a little. Today is going horribly though. I am trying to tell my friends, but they aren't responding to my texts and my chest feels like it's going to implode. I just want to flail it all out. I haven't had a panic attack that is sporadic in some years. I can't hold my stomach in. I don't want to leave my bed. Reddit, if you could please spare me some time to speak I would be the happiest Dame in the world. I do not wish to bother you though. I have to leave right now. I'm sorry.",
