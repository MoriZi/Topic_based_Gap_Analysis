Now I hope this is a misquote, because there were probably more than one person in your class that suffers from Anxiety, and because of that statement were left feeling like there is no hope or fix. It is common knowledge that Anxiety is a mental illness and I emphasize illness. As someone who has suffered from this illness for ten years, I am appalled that that this rumour is going around. Along with Anxiety comes depression and we should be teaching that there is a fix, you can get better, it's not just something you get over. If you believe this to be true I will happily show you studies as well as friends of mine who are sick with the illness as well. I know you, and I am not putting words in your mouth, but it was brought to my attention and I was really upset about it. If I would have been in your class, and have heard that, I would have felt hopeless, especially if this class was a psychology class. I am sorry if this is all untrue but I just have felt uneasy since it was brought to my attention. I think Anxiety is an epidemic throughout the school system and needs to be seen as an illness, not some negative stigma. I would be glad to talk to you about this in person or anyone who needs someone to talk to. Like I said, I hope it was a misquote but I just want kids/young adults to feel safe and comfortable with the person they are, and not be told to get over it.\n\n",

For instance if a friend doesn't message me back on Facebook or I have an awkward exchange with someone, or in general a bad experience, I always feel as though this experience would only happen to me. and only me. I know that other people suffer from anxiety, depression, loneliness, and mad thoughts that even lead some to suicide, but my negative experience is some how separate then these. I logically know that this is most likely untrue, and that I am experiencing the same feelings that everyone else is, yet I feel mine is worse and I don't have anyway of know exactly how other people feel.\n\nAnyone else feel this way? I've never heard it talked about on this subreddit, or even in years of therapy talking with my psychologist. I have extreme low self confidence which I think might be the cause.   \n\nEDIT: Thanks for all the great responses! Really wasn't expecting all this.  ",

Thinking about the violence and unfortunate lives of the people in the movie just sorta got to me. And the other day, I had to get up and walk away when the family had Dr. Phil on because it was giving me anxiety thinking about how dire the situation was for this guy who drinks too much and all the stress he and his family was going through. My parents found it surprising that a story about a drunk person would be stressful to hear about at all.\n\nMy whole life I've been more sensitive of a person than others.

            "selftext": "I was born with a heart defect. It's fairly common and is usually corrected with surgery when kids are like 3-6 years old. Mine was discovered when I was 15. I had just moved and needed a sports physical to play volleyball. All throughout middle school I did volleyball, swimming, and track, so I had done plenty of physicals in the past and never thought there would be a problem.\n\nThe new doctor heard a murmur. Since that was the first we had heard of it, I was sent to a specialist to get an ultrasound done. My doctor came back and said there was a hole in my heart and it was large enough that I needed to get surgery or my heart would wear out and I would die when I was 30. Obviously, I opted for the surgery. Even though I had it done, I couldn't get the \"die at 30\" thing out of my head. I have always known it wasn't rational, and as much as I knew nothing bad would happen at 30, I've always been extremely afraid of getting that old.\n\nMy last echo was done when I was 18, to make sure everything was good. They said everything looked perfect, but to get checked out every 10 years or so just in case. I haven't had any real problems, but I do get palpitations and my feet go numb when I'm having a panic attack.\n\nWell, I'm 28 now so it was time to go again. Yesterday I went to a cardiologist for the first time in a decade and had told him all about the surgery, how it was caught late, etc. I told him about what happens during panic attacks and he didn't really seem concerned (in a good way. I don't mean that like he was cold and unfeeling about it).\n\nThen I mentioned the \"surgery or die at 30\" thing. He looked at me and said \"they really told you that?\" He went on to say that people with defects like mine DO have a decreased life expectancy, but it's normally like 50-60 if they don't get fixed, and IF my defect was bad enough to make me die at 30, there's no way I would have been doing sports because my heart would not have been able to keep up the necessary blood flow. He assured me that since it got fixed, my life expectancy is pretty much normal. \n\nI can't even put into words how frustrating it is that I've been absurdly anxious about turning 30 for nearly half of my life, and not only is it not an issue since I had the surgery, but it wasn't even a true statement in the first place.\n\nI'm pretty sure that all of the time I've spent stressing about dying early did more damage to my heart than the defect ever could have.",

I'm currently experiencing it.  I wouldn't call it a panic attack because I don't feel frozen or like I'm panicking.  I feel like I can still think clearly enough... from the descriptions I've read of people's panic attacks I don't think I've ever experienced one.  \n\nBasically when I get this way, my throat hurts, my stomach is painfully clenched, and I feel this uncomfortable buzzing in my head and body non-stop all day long.  When I get this way, no distractions make it stop, no amount of rational thinking makes it stop.  Like right now, I have nothing in the foreseeable future to be *that* anxious about.  Thinking about getting to do things I usually really enjoy doesn't help at all.  Even if I tell myself I'm going to play video games for a couple hours and then sleep in tomorrow, nope, still feel like I'm about to die.\n\nI sometimes wonder if medication would relieve this at all, but my mom is *very* much against me going on medication.  And I would like to avoid it too but I'm open to it if it would really help.  \n\nI'm wondering if anyone else has had these types of symptoms of anxiety and has found relief for it.",

            "selftext": "To start off I wanted to thank everyone in this subreddit. I used to be a big lurker of r/anxiety when things were tough and knowing other people were going through the same problems as me really helped me through a very difficult time.\n\nYou don't see too many success stories on forums like this and I think it's because honestly once your anxiety's gone there's not many reasons to go back. If anything it just puts you back on edge.\n\nAnyways I wanted to give back to the people who helped me and if this helps even one person I'll be very pleased.\n\nIn my mind there are 3 areas of improvement you need to focus on to get rid of that daily mind melting anxiety.\n\n1. Lifestyle Changes\n2. Coping Techniques\n3. Belief Changes\n\nI'll go into detail for each one but I think the first two are really important for decreasing your anxiety level (back to normal) and the third is necessary if you don't want it to come back.\n\n1. Lifestyle changes:This category is about respecting your body and giving it what it needs to get better.\n\nStart with food. If you don't have the vitamins your body needs it can be difficult for your muscles and brain to relax. Focus on fish (Omega3s), probiotic yogurt, and make sure your just generally get a healthy diet. Caffeine should be cut back or just simply quit drinking coffee and soft drinks all together.\nExercise. It may suck at first but exercising is probably the most relaxing thing there is. Try jogging, lifting weights, sit-ups, really anything that you can do for a prolonged period of time. It'll help you sleep and it lets you zone out of the anxiety if you're really pushing yourself.\n \n2. Coping techniques: It's important to understand what triggers your anxiety and things you can do to bring it down once it's up.\n\nMeditation is amazing but takes some practicing to do right. Once you figure it out you can do it anywhere and it instantly relieves stress.\nProgressive muscle relaxation is similar to meditation but a lot easier to do. You tense one set of muscles as hard as you can for twenty seconds then exhale and feel the tension release. This is perfect for getting rid of constantly tense muscles.\n\nThe most important thing is realizing that when your thoughts start racing you're simply being irrational. I know the feeling, one minute your convinced you're going insane and the next you think you're having a heart attack. I still have a bit of hypochondria so whenever I have a weird new ailment I promise myself not to look it up on the internet because i'm just going to trick myself into thinking I have something that I don't. It helps to have someone you can talk to about these things who can give you rational advice when your mind starts to go into overdrive. \n\nI also find being busy helps a lot. If you're busy you have far less time time to stew about how your feeling today. So do something, take up a hobby, spend more time on work or with your friends just don't sit in your house alone.\n\nOn that note the worst thing you can do is avoid your anxiety. You will never get better by just avoiding everything in your life that stresses you out. I know how incredibly hard this is but you have to do it, giving in to the disease is not an option. This includes using recreational drugs to feel normal. You need to address the underlying issue.\n\n3. Belief Changes: This is what will change your life and hopefully eliminate your anxiety for good but it's also the hardest of the three tasks to do.\n\nI was convinced for about 2 years that my anxiety was ultimately incurable. I had many different theories as to why (it was genetic because my mom used to have anxiety/I've always been sorta anxious. I smoked too much weed and it warped my mind, etc.) I really was not in a good place. Constant panic attacks, weird symptoms and hopelessness made me seriously depressed. I would go through periods where I felt like I was getting better but it would eventually come back. This was because I didn't really believe I could get better. I thought anxiety was a part of who I was and that scared me immensely. It took a lot of therapy and lifestyle changes to realize that while maybe I was more prone to anxiety than others my thoughts and beliefs were the real problem.\n\nIt was during a long run when I had an epiphany. I couldn't feel any anxiety, it was amazing. The anxiety quickly returned but I realized then and there that the real problem was my constant focus on my my anxiety to see if it was still there or getting worse. There really wasn't any part of the day when I wasn't aware of my anxiety and that awareness made me anxious. I decided to simply stop reacting to my anxiety. It didn't go away at first. But it was amazing how quickly it got better, now that I believed I could. I simply stopped paying so much attention to it and went of with my life. Eventually it occurred to me that it wasn't thinking about it at all because it was gone. I've been that way for 2 years now and though I will occasionally freak myself out now and then I always remember that i'm the one in control and it never last for more than a day. More importantly I'm happy, healthy and living the life I want to.\n\nIn conclusion it's not easy getting rid of anxiety but I think for the majority of people it's possible but you have to believe you can. Try using steps 1 and 2 to get yourself to a place where you realize your thoughts ultimately control your emotions and then make those thoughts positive. You might have a lot of setbacks and it won't happen all at once but with perseverance you can get to where you want to go. All the best and be kind to yourself.  \n\n ",

            "selftext": "I am sorry I am not sure if this is the right sub, but I feel only you guys can understand what it is going on. I wanted to first thank you all in the community here and the support for people in need.  I am desperately asking for your help. Any of your advice will be extremely appreciated.  \n\nPlease stay with me. I am going to tell you a little about the story first. \n\nI met this amazing girl in my school. She's intelligent, mature, logical and very cute. We have many things in common. I can see myself spending the rest of my life with her. This is not to say everything is perfect, we have our problems, but i am willing to work out because I believe no relationships are 100% perfect, and it is worthwhile to get to know each other better, strengthen and deepen the relationship. \n\nShe has anxiety. I found out after we started dating. After 5 days of being together, she couldn't handle it anymore -- she broke it with me, mainly due to her anxiety and that we spent too much time together (we share an office). Of course, I still like her very much. I think I am starting to love her now. \n\nShe has a strong will, and has been fighting it very bravely. She has been doing the right thing to meet with a therapist once a week. She's taking meds once a day. Other than that, I don't know how she is feeling everyday exactly. It's been two months after we broke up. I can see there has been ups and downs in her emotions. I tried both backing off and just asking if she's ok both she's down. \n\nMost recently, my emotions have been rising and dipping with hers everyday. Over the past week before friday,  I started to have feelings that she is feeling especially down or out of it. I started to get anxious, worried and really depressed myself. I was not able to take my mind off of it every single day. Even worse, these feelings are created from my guesses whether she is indeed feeling down because she can sometimes hide it so well; she was able to hide her anxiety from me for the past year. Nevertheless, I started to get incredibly worried.\n\nSo I fucked up on friday. Usually there's happy hour Friday nights and I thought she would go to it so to take things off her mind. So after my 7pm meeting with my boss (which sucked on a friday night), I went to happy hour to see she's there. She was not. I got even more worried and starting to think in my mind that she's taking it in all alone or doesn't care anymore. All these negative thoughts started flushing through my mind. \n\nSo I called her. I ask if she's ok and if she wanted any company. She said shes fine and refused to see me. She said wanted to get some work done instead. But I kept pushing, I wanted to see her face to know how she is really doing. (I really shouldn't have kept pushing, I know how stupid it was, given all the things I have learned and read from this subreddit, if there was one thing I learned it should be not giving her anymore pressure and just be there). \n\nI started crying during the call. I ranted how I don't know she is doing everyday. I told her again my trust issues; when she says she is fine I would think she's just lying to me. I really fucked up. I kept pushing, asking questions why she won't let me help even if I want in. She told me she feels broken if there's someone constantly looking after her. I told her for the first time, I love her. She told me I don't really know her that well. She told me that I should back off and maybe after a few months (winter break) it would be easier. \n\nI really fucked up the whole thing. I don't know what will happen from now on. And the fact that we will see each other everyday in the office will make her even more uneasy about the situation. I've made things worse for her than already is. I really need to make an apology. From those of you who understands her better, how do I go forward with her? What should be my mindset in terms of helping her and going forward? How do I make the apology? Is there anything else I can do in addition to backing off completely?\n\nThank you all so much for reading and giving your advice. \n\nedit: spellings and words\n",
