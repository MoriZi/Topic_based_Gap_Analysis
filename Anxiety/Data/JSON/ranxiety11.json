            "selftext": "\"Thoughts.\"  I quoted that purposefully, because \"thoughts\" are the key to many (if not the vast majority of) people's anxiety.  Over the past 50 years or so, researchers have discovered connections between feelings/emotions, healthy and unhealthy, and thoughts.   People with feelings of anxiety, depression, anger, etc. had similar types of thoughts.  \n\nSo researchers tried something pretty novel - they said \"fuck asking a person about mom and dad, let's see if we can directly challenge a person's thoughts and see if that affects feelings/emotions.\"  \n\nHere's what they found: \n\nPeople with feelings of anxiety, fear, and panic, nearly always have thoughts that they are in danger, and it can be any kind at all; danger of losing social status, being rejected, being physically harmed, having an illness, losing a job, dying, or even danger of becoming anxious (fear of fear).  Your mind creates the danger, whether it actually exists or not, and it is unable to distinguish between real danger and imagined or perceived danger.  The physical reaction you have is identical when you have mere 'thoughts' of danger as it is to the reaction if an actual lion were standing before you ready to chomp. \n\nInterestingly, people with feelings of sadness, helplessness, and depression nearly always have thoughts that they have lost something irretrievably, while feelings of anger are connected with thoughts that things are not as they \"should\" be, according to your idea, and that things \"should\" be different. \n\nResearchers then discovered that people with unhealthy levels of sadness, anxiety, guilt, shame, anger, etc. all seemed to have **irrational, unsupported, untrue, and otherwise illogical** thoughts of the types I just mentioned.  For example, an anxious person had thoughts of something dangers, and those thoughts were irrational, illogical, and sometimes really off-the-wall with no basis in reality.  \n\nSo the researchers set out to help people **identify their thoughts, challenge them, and modify them.**\n\nHere's a neat example of how thoughts, whether empirically true or not, can have monumental impacts on your emotions: \n\n*Your coworker calls to tell you that the lottery ticket you bought is the winner - $200 million, divided among 5 people.  You're ecstatic, your mind racing with thoughts of paying off debt, helping others, taking relaxing vacations, and buying that coveted Reddit-monogrammed leather miniskirt you always admired.  But your coworker got it wrong.  She looked at last week's winning numbers, and this week, you didn't win.*\n\nObjectively, you were never a millionaire.  You won nothing.  But the \"thought\" of it, without having a single dollar in your hands, without paying off any debt or taking any vacations, made you happy.  There was no connection between truth and reality and your thoughts and connected emotions. \n\nHere's an example of how anxiety tends to work: \n\n*You are going to a party, and you just **know** you're going to say something stupid to someone, and everyone will laugh at you and talk about you for years.  You may even become so embarrassed that your name is forever linked with social-failure, the old \"Munson\" syndrome.*\n\nThis thought is completely illogical and irrational, yet your body physiologically reacts as if you actually, truly are in danger of losing respect, being vilified, and having people look down upon you for eternity.\n\nCognitive Behavioral Therapy teaches people to identify their feelings and emotions, search for the \"thoughts,\" and then challenge those thoughts using various methods.  These methods include: \n\n* directly analyzing the truth/falsity of your thoughts by writing them and reviewing them\n* challenging the truth/falsity by doing something, like actually going to the party and seeing if you end up universally vilified forever\n* digging into the foundation for the thoughts, by searching for underlying fears and concerns and then challenging those. \n\n\nI thought I'd share this with all, because I spent years working on anxiety before researching CBT and reading books about it, and it can change your life. \n\n**EDIT**:  Thought I'd share another few postings on this subject with another Redditor.  http://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/ntbu0/anxiety_attack/c3byymn?context=3\n\n",

The volunteers would know in advance what they were getting in to: where the event would be (maybe with a building map with entrances/exits and restrooms), the type of work they would do, and how long the event would last. \n\nPerhaps the person leading it could talk a little in the beginning about anxiety and how the participants may be feeling. They could encourage people to discuss their feelings with other volunteers while working. They could remind people of their success so far (they made it to the event!) and talk about the organization the volunteers are helping. \n\nSince the organizers can't necessarily rely on people coming, the volunteer work could be something that is not time dependent like making blankets or sorting donations or assembling care packages. \n\nI would give something like that a try!

History I have an A+ in because it's all lecture and I've completed both essay assignments and the first exam and the lectures are online, so it's a zero-effort class. Sociology is similar. What I'm truly worried about is Precalculus, which I'm failing and have only attended twice in two months. Every time I wake up on time to go to class I have this overwhelming anxiety that forces me to hide in my room for most of the day. Sometimes I don't come out for days, and I don't eat. I worry that my effort to recover from my surgery, strep, and bronchitis is futile and that there is nothing I can do to bring my grade back up. My teacher won't admit that she is partially at fault for not answering my emails when I was ill. The syllabus does say that there are no makeup quizzes (the majority of our grade) unless there is prior notification, which she had plenty from me. All she said when I met with her was that I had to pass the final with at least a B to get a D in the class. She claimed that her computer was broken for 3 days and that is why she didn't get my emails and that she will not honor them. It upset me so much because I was prepared for them, and now I've gone into a deep depression and become agoraphobic because I think that there is nothing I can do. My biggest concern is having to show my parents my final grades. I had to drop one course already after my surgery, and now this. Oh and another fun thing I deal with: I have so much anxiety  over speaking about my anxiety that I won't go to counseling. Every time I have to go in that building I get nauseated. I need some serious help. Right now talking to people on the internet is my only solace.",
