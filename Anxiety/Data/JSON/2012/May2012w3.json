I was experiencing panic attack sensations for the past week, but only at work. Yesterday I was only supposed to work three hours but the palpitations and PVCs (I have an underlying heart condition to boot) got so strong I started feeling short of breath and had trouble talking without gasping. I left work after two hours and reported to the walk-in and they transferred me to the ER on oxygen. Three hours and some Ativan later the PVCs were still strong but they released me.

No results. \n\nI found cognitive behavioral therapy.  The guy I found was good - real good.  He speaks/teaches all over, and he's got a LOT of angles to deal with difficult minds that don't want to release bad thoughts. \n\nI also found a local woman, who was not good, but definitely was a CBT practitioner.  She was a year or so out of school, and her chops were not tight yet. \n\n\nA good therapist for anxiety must WORK WITH YOU.  This means trying different approaches, accepting your honest feedback, knowing when they are heading in the wrong direction, and having the experience to spot the sticking points and help you overcome them. \n\nFrom my experience personally, and from reading books on CBT, including instructor manuals, a good therapist should direct you to RESULTS quickly.  Like within 3 months you should have a lot of \"ah ha\" moments where you realize exactly what your mind is doing to you, why, and how to stop it.  Then after that you should be working toward automatically stopping the anxious responses to the underlying thoughts. \n\nIf your therapist is not helping, don't fret.  Try another one, supplement with books/workbooks/audio/meetup.com groups, or whatever.  But don't think it's a lost cause, because it's not. ",

            "selftext": "Okay folks, so I'm going out on a limb here.  I know that Reddit is full of people who are very reason-oriented, but I want to stress that I am actually one of those people.  However, I am also human enough to admit that I do feel comfort when exploring my \"spiritual\" side.  \n\nI always expected my anxiety to get better as I aged, like it was some kind of teenager/early adult problem.  I turned 30 this year and I'm managing, but it's definitely always in the background.  Anyway, I have found myself looking for some meaning to help guide my path through all this and I'm finding myself more and more drawn to Native American spirituality.  It shares so many connections with the physical world and doesn't try to explain everything through its narrow dogma.  As someone who strongly believes in focusing on reason and science, I have found a balance here.  \n\nAt the end of the day, I can look at things that the Native American traditions have used to explain every day happenings, and while I can say it sounds pretty far fetched, I can relate to the connection with nature and the relationship that the human mind makes with its own habitat.  \n\nThis is getting long-winded, so I'll leave this post with something that helps me.  I was going through some really hard times a couple years ago and my anxiety was at its worst.  I was having a really extreme panic attack one night when I heard this strange howling and yipping outside.  I realized that there was a pack of coyotes roaming through the fields near my home, and they sounded like they were having a really great time.  I suddenly felt completely at peace and the sounds they were making really changed me somehow (like I said, I know this is going to sound weird).  Anyway, I was so flabbergasted with how that sound changed something in me that night, so I just started reading about coyotes to learn some things about them.\n\nI learned that the coyote is one of the few creatures to survive in a world that is falling more and more out of balance with man, I learned that they are thriving in situations where they shouldn't be, I learned that they are strong, resilient creatures, and I completely related with them.  I feel so fucking out of place in today's world, but I'm somehow surviving through all of it.  That's when I ran across the totemic explanation of the coyote, which I will let speak for itself:\n\n\"Wisdom, Folly\n\nThe Coyote teaches you how wisdom and folly\ngo hand-in-hand.\nIn the folly of others, we see our own foolishness\nand we learn from their mistakes. \n\nIf a Coyote totem has appeared in your life,\nbe prepared for \"Murphy's Law\" to enter your life with a vengeance.\nYour sense of humor will arise full force in keeping with the things happening around you.\nBlind dates, things that suddenly don't work, all this is Coyote humor. \nYou need to learn to laugh at yourself and Life's irony.\n\nCoyote energy is tied to simplicity and trust.  \nIt stimulates and renews innocence and reawakens a childlike wisdom in the world.\nA Coyote's howl touches your soul, reminding us of our primal connections.\n\nCoyote people are very adaptive to new situations\nand have close-knit families, especially when children are involved.\"\n\nTL;DR: I find comfort in the ancient beliefs of the Native Americans and eastern shamans-- how does spirituality help you?\n",

I don't know if this has been done before on here, as I've only recently found out about this subreddit, but it has been tremendously helpful/relatable to me. By getting submissions from people from all over who suffer from anxiety (any kind - formal or informal diagnosis), I'd really make a commitment to complete this zine by the end of the summer.

(you can be creative with it) Negative and positive thoughts/experiences/coping strategies (i.e. I like to bite my lips/the skin around my nails) are all welcome. It can be completely anonymous if desired (I can understand that), or I can sign your name at the end. There are absolutely no limits to what is shared, or how it is shared [i.e. in the form of art, poetry, lists, tips, etc].\n\nArtwork is greatly encouraged! I'll be doing the layout and some of the artwork, but I would really like it if others would like to submit some art :) Perhaps something you've drawn when you were feeling especially anxious, or anything to accompany something you've/someone else has written. Also just art in general to spruce up the zine.\n\nAny ideas that anyone has are greatly welcome and appreciated. Even an overall title for the zine! Simply put, this is a zine for people whose anxiety makes daily living even just a little unbearable - no formal DSM diagnoses required.",

            "selftext": "So I have been taking Wellbutrin for my anxiety now about a couple months.  It helped for a while and then my doctor changed the dose I take from 100mg to 75mg twice a day.\n\nThe 100mg seemed like it was starting to wear off in the late afternoon since I took it at night.  SO the reasoning was a lower dose twice a day.\n\nThe 3rd, 4th and 5th days after the change were great.  I felt awesome, didnt have any anxiety issues and felt decent.  Since the 6th day (this past thursday) I have been going down hill.  I have been anxious, very disconnected and like I am in a dream like state all the time.  Today has been the worst.  \n\nI felt great this morning until about 2 hours after I took my morning dose.  I was at lunch and I felt horrible.  I had to get groceries with my wife and we went home after.\n\nI got home and went to go take nap.  I tried to sleep my anxiety got the best of me. I got up and started to talk to my wife and just lost it emotionally.\n\nTL;DR - Have you had a med that worked for you but you changed the dose and it no longer worked and made things worse?",

            "selftext": "EDIT* Hello r/Anxiety! I'm a 20 year old College student who's been dealing with anxiety and depression since I was 12. I didn't notice I was so sad when I was younger, but I did notice I started to suffer with anxiety and depression when I hit the age of 14. I went through a lot not knowing what these feelings were and doing nothing but harm to myself and no one wanting to help me go through and everything misunderstanding how I felt and calling me out that I simply want attention. I remember when I was 12 I didn't recognize my behavior as anxiety but realized it after getting out of high school that all that anxiety over getting up a chair and walking because I thought people were going to make fun of my walking, the self mutilation, the bullying, my old journal--were all signs of depression. But at the beginning of High School I struggled more and more as I tried to do my best academically and in sports as well. I remember that it was so hard to wake up the mornings. Sometimes it was so unbareble that I wanted to kill myself because the feeling was too strong. It's so odd that I didn't think it was serious, but when I hit college I realized the anxiety was too much in my life when I saw much it affected my classes. So I decided to get a therapist. \n\nAnd this day, was just that day that I was waiting for to see why I was this way.\n\nToday I had a break through with my therapist and realized I am suffering depression and anxiety as an adult because as a child all I faced was disappointment. Everyone around me simply disappointed me. My parents weren't there for me, my brothers and sisters weren't there for me, and had no friends; just people that bullied me. Everyone treated me like shit. My parents constantly beat the shit out of me, my brother and sister would give me a hard time and make fun of me because I was a little chubby, and they would make the neighbor kids chine in. The worst part is that I had no one defend me as a child, and even had the neighbor kid's PARENTS make fun of me for being poor, used clothing, and being chubby. \n\nNow, as a YOUNG adult I do realize WHY they did it: my parent's marriage was going down, my brother and sister were BOTH rapped, and god knows why the neighborhood kids did this to me. But throughout my life I had people push me around and bully me, and realized throughout the years I have realized that my expectations is mediocre expectations. Because of this socializing has been HELL for me. Talking to people always gets me anxious, and sometimes anxiety creeps on me for no reason and i'm left as an emotional mess the whole day.\n\nMy life has improved since currently i'm employed, going to school and decided to attend therapy, but that little girl that has been wanting to cry out why no one was willing to defend her and make her feel that she is a worthy human being is finally coming out. I hate that naturally i'm a pessimistic person. I try so hard to live my life without anxiety creeping in. And I do realize why I am so angry and why I its coming out now.\n\nI'm mad and so sad because just because they were having a hard time with their lives doesn't mean they had to make someone else's life insignificant. Just because your life is feeling shitty doesn't mean you have to go and make my life a living hell too. It wasn't fair. I was a child. I didn't know these problems existed. And I am tired of giving excuses to these people because thanks to them I struggle with the anxiety that a child was never meant to face. \n\nI'm currently crying typing this. Its just sad to think that I was disappointed by the people around me. I was a child with no one to depend on. And now, its difficult to trust people.\n\nI just want someone to read this, because I can't open up to anyone about this. I don't trust anyone in my life to take what I just said seriously. I mean, this is a legitimate reason to feel this way right? I don't know why I struggle to feel secure about my thoughts and feelings with people, but this is just how I feel. I'm mad because no one bothered to think how I felt in all of this. I'm mad because I could of been a mentally healthy adult. I'm mad because they ruined me psychologically. \n\nI'm actually a little happy that for the first time I was able to explain my feelings. Most of the times my feelings are bouncing place to place but I think I nailed it. Just too afraid that someone might say i'm full of shit.\n\nTalk to me r/anxiety, is this okay to feel this way? is anyone facing something similar as this? \n\n\nEDIT: I didn't introduce myself!",

            "selftext": "I've always been a fairly high-strung person, but never experienced full-blown anxiety until I became a vegetarian. A few vitamin supplements brought me back to being functional.\n\nIf you are a vegetarian (or think your diet may be contributing to your anxiety), I recommend trying *B complex* (make certain you grab complex) and *flaxseed oil* supplements. I also take a multivitamin to make sure I'm covering all my bases. The B complex seems to be the most important; make sure the label reads \"vegetarian formula,\" though. I experimented with a week on, week off when I started taking the supplements and the difference was dramatic. Around three weeks into taking them daily, I noticed that I could tell I if was late because my anxiety became constrictive.\n\nFair warning: the niacin in the B complex turns urine neon yellow. Don't freak out.\n\nI am not a medical professional and I don't know how others might react to these supplements. They are all over-the-counter. B vitamins are water-soluble, so you won't OD on them. I expect that they are completely safe, but advise anyone who tries them to pay attention to any changes in their bodies, if only to gauge effectiveness.\n\n**TL;DR:** Try supplementing your diet with **B complex, flaxseed oil, and a daily multivitamin** to possibly reduce anxiety. Stick with it for a week or two. Then, if you're the type to experiment, stop taking them and note the differences. \n\nI hope this helps! It enabled me to stop hiding.",

            "selftext": "So, I'm 21 years old. I just graduated from University. During the past month, I've had at least 2 anxiety attacks that were so bad that I thought I was going to die or pass out. I've also had others that felt almost as bad. For instance, yesterday I was driving my girlfriend to my house and felt like I was going to have a panic attack, throw up, or pass out. I also have what seems like all day anxiety. My stomach hurts and I have trouble breathing. Just writing this, I've having trouble breathing. I also get anxious thoughts where I feel like I can see my whole life spinning out of control to the point where I die, go crazy, or turn into an agoraphobic. I've suspected I've had general anxiety for at least 2 years now, but I don't think it has ever been *this* bad before.\n\nNow that I've graduated I'm supposed to go back to my waiter job tomorrow. I've been dreading it all week. I get terrible anxiety just thinking about it. I feel have no internal confidence anymore. I'm petrified about fishing trips I had planned, about vacations far away, job interviews in the city, and even simple sometimes shit like just picking up my gf or going to the mall. \n\nI have a psychiatrist/therapist. I've been seeing him for 2-3 weeks now and maybe 4 sessions so far. I feel a little better since the day after my last really really bad panic attack but not by much. I've been on the lowest dose of klonopins for about 2-3 weeks (cutting it in half taking it twice daily). It kind of worked the first week, but now I feel like it completely lost its effect. I also have xanax that I take when I feel a panic attack coming on. With this anxiety I feel like I can't do anything anymore and that really scares me. I feel like a different person and I don't like it. I'm thinking of going on Zoloft or some other SSRI but my Doc seems hesitant. I had a fucked up childhood and he thinks talking can fix it. But I don't know, I just don't want this interfering in my life anymore. I like my waiter job, and I might have a huge job opportunity coming up in a month in a far away city (nervous about going there alone). I don't want anxiety to get in the way anymore.\n\nOkay, so I guess here are my questions. (Try not to be too pessimistic. I feel like this board is just the blind leading the blind sometimes. One person having a panic attack freaking out trying to talk to another person freaking out. lol) So here they are: How can I make it through tomorrow? Is that the best way to beat this thing? Just keep breaking my comfort zone even if it means I'll have some really bad panic attacks? Can someone give me confidence, tell me I'm not alone, they beat it, and how? Are meds the answer or can I beat this without it? How hard will that be? Is this just a normal thing I'll go through for a few months that a lot of graduates go through, or will I have this my whole life? How will talk therapy (and only talk therapy) cure me of this?\n\nEdit: In case anyone was wondering about my lifestyle. Living at home with just my dad. Get at least 30 minutes of exercise a day by going to the gym, going for a run, or by playing basketball. Haven't had alcohol in 2 weeks. Haven't had a cigarette in 4 weeks. Haven't had caffeine in 4 weeks. Don't do drugs. ",
