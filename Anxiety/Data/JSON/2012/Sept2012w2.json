            "selftext": "Hi!\n \nHere is my backstory:\n \nAt around 15, I began to experience anxiety, mainly in social situations. Also, I got in a series of car wrecks that left me very anxious. Around this time I began seeing a therapist and a couple years later I began meds. But nothing helped that much.\n \nThe problem grew and by college I was avoiding people as much as possible. Eye contact was a nightmare. I wasn\u2019t even comfortable looking at my family. Speaking in class was out of the question. And I would get anxious in cars and sometimes I'd just freak myself out while alone.\n \nWell, from ages 15-30 I struggled terribly. I'm sure you're familiar with this story. It ruined my social life and my academic career. I couldn't hold a job. The few I had, I would sometimes have to hide in the bathroom, I\u2019d perform tasks poorly, and ultimately I would just quit showing up. I would usually make up some convoluted excuse that I would leave on their answering machines, then never speak to them again.\n \nOver these 15 years, I was on a total of 19 drugs. From Klonopin to Zoloft to Seroquel and Geodon. And saw nearly as many psychologists and psychiatrists. On more than one occasion I showed up at the ER, just wanting the anxiety and confusion to end. I\u2019d get an MRI, which of course showed nothing, and other times I was given referrals to more Psychiatrists. Nothing worked. So, you get the idea.\n \nThen, 16 months ago, I went through \"enlightenment\". It is silly useless word, but that's what people call it.\n \nHere's how:\nI downloaded the audio version of Eckhart Tolle's *The Power Of Now*.\nI listened to it over and over again. Despite the occasional unappealing New Agey phrase (i.e., \"I have lived with several Zen masters, all of them cats. Or \"You are sitting on your own box of gold.\" Oh, and he mentions Jesus (as a Zen master).  Jesus doesn\u2019t freaking matter here, so hopefully that\u2019s not too big of a distraction. Anyways, I knew that Tolle was pointing to a deep truth.\n \n**So, here's basically the change required:**\n \n**Learn to observe your mind**. For instance, think of your mother or job (or what/whoever). \"See\" with your mind the emotions and/or thoughts that are evoked by bringing you mother up. This \u201cseeing\u201d part of your brain is what we\u2019re concerned with. \n \nNow stop thinking. And wait and see what the next thought will be to pop up in your brain.  It is *this* neurobehavior that you want to execute. Always be watching your thinking brain with your consciousness.  Try not to make any judgments or analyses, as those are themselves, thoughts.\n\nAfter a while, it took about 6 weeks for me, you will come to the point where you can \"see\" every thought you make, and **you will be able to stop thinking whenever you want and for as long as you want**.\n \nAnd here are two things that can help this process:\n \n1. Realize deeply that it is literally always Now. This isn't meant to evoke a hippy attitude or make a philosophical statement; it's just an objective truth.\n \n2. Feel your body as a whole from within. That may sound hippyish, but it has a grounding effect that keeps all of your attention from flying right up and into your head.\n \n \n \nTolle makes many metaphysical extrapolations from this shift in consciousness, but please don\u2019t let that be a distraction for you. Your only responsibility in this is to adopt this neurobehavior I have described.\n \n \nAnd so here\u2019s what happened to me: I came out of my disorder 100%. Of course I can get apprehensive here and there, but that\u2019s just human. And I\u2019ve had some challenges to figure out along the way. But haven\u2019t felt whole like this since I was a child. And socializing and working are no problem. I don\u2019t take meds nor do I see a therapist. I won\u2019t go on and on about my transformation, but hopefully this will help some of you, as I know very well the horrors of a mind out of control.\n\ntl;dr - Had a lot of anxiety, now I have none. Observing your thinking brain is the way out.",

I really just felt that I was having trouble adjusting and that it would go away, but it hasn't yet. My boyfriend goes to school in the area too, but I started before him so we were apart for about a month. I thought that as soon as he got here everything would be a lot better, but I'm still having anxiety, especially in the morning. \n\nAt first i was anxious about the move, whether i made the right decision, etc., and missing my boyfriend. Recently it changed to me being anxious about my college classes, but now I seem to be anxious for no reason. \nThe last 3 days I've woken up feeling sick to my stomach and actually did get mildly sick. I thought it was because of a test I had Tuesday, but this morning I still felt sick. Even this afternoon when I woke up from a nap, I felt incredibly anxious for honestly no reason. \n\nI don't understand what's going on and why I can't seem to get rid of this. \nAnyone have any of the same experiences or advice? \nThanks.\n\nUPDATE: I just wanted to tell you guys that the past 5 days have been way better. The drinking more water idea has really been helping me, and so has just trying to stay as positive as I can all day. \nThank you guys so much for your support! I never expected to get so many replies for this. \nI hope the others suffering from this get some relief soon as well!",

            "selftext": "I've had a really bad bout of anxiety these past few weeks. I can only guess why, but I have recently put in my two weeks at work for a new job, and I felt terrible about leaving all of my co-workers behind. The two weeks flew by in a terrible anxiety induced haze, but this week after my last day I bought a pair of running shoes and started running for the first time in probably 10 years and I've felt amazing since. Things were ~~a little better~~ really tough after the first run, but the best part has always come near the end of my sessions when the adrenaline has been flowing for a while. The anxiety crept back after a quick shower after the first run BUT was the best it had ever been. Slowly but surely it has dissipated after about a week. \n\nI'm not saying that exercise is the complete solution, I know that anxiety happens for different reasons, but it sure as hell doesn't hurt to try if you are physically able. I was inspired by [r/running](http://www.reddit.com/r/running), and I'd recommend checking out their beginner FAQ if you're interested. I'm doing the \"from your couch to 5K in nine weeks\" program, and while it was tough to start, it was well worth it, and I look forward to exercising on my running days now!\n\nAgain, I know that there isn't a cure all solution for anxiety, but I know how much it sucks and I wanted others to know what has helped me lately. \n\nEDIT: Thanks for sharing your experiences, everyone!",

I didn't drink coffee, I took a nice shower, I'm very tired, I will surely fall asleep soon. \n\nNo, I won't. During the night I will keep trying to relax, play white noise, think about fluffy cute pets, think about how good my next day will be, how I love my work, how good the life is..\n\nNo use. Some idiotic memories will come back. I feel embarrassed. Them I remember about my current relationship problems, my partner is not with me now, I miss him so fucking much, I start crying. Then I think about the future, I can only afford to save 5-10% of my salary, and I need to save 20% each month, what if I lose my job. What my partner will break up with me, what am I going to live for without him. What if he had an accident? What if he's dead???? It's 3am, I cant text or call him and wake him up. I have to wait until morning. What if he's dead. Crying again.\n\nI'm the most pathetic person ever. I can't control my sleep. I have nightmares quite often, it doesn't help. \n\nI'm not on any medication, I'm willing to fight these thoughts on my own-please, if you can advise any method of how to fight with them, help me. I work in the coastguard, very often I would have to stay awake whole night - my sleep pattern is fucked up and I'm meant to learn how to fall asleep whenever possible, to regenerate. But I fail to do so, usually I don't get sleep for 1 whole night, and then next few - just 3-4 hours each night. And then on days off I sleep 7-8 max. It's not enough. I'm exhausted.",

I mainly have health anxiety but that branched into others like social anxiety and agoraphobia. \n\nThankfully, my anxiety is stable much more these days thanks to counselling and self help. \n\nHowever, I've always had a high amount of anxiety in terms of being hungry. It stems from having a fear of passing out. \n\nWhen I eat, 2-3 hours later I'll feel starving hungry and I'll start to shake, feel anxious, have palpitations... Pretty much all the usual symptoms of low blood sugar. I've had a fasting blood test and my results were in the normal range so I always put down my hunger symptoms to anxiety.\n\nI have to plan my days purely on when I'm going to eat next, making sure I eat every 2-3 hours in order to be sure my blood sugar won't crash low enough to make me pass out.\n\nI'm more worried about this lately because I start a new job tomorrow and I'll have to go 5 hours without eating after lunch, I know this may sound really petty to most of you but it scares me because right now all my anxiety is based around me thinking I'll pass out because of how hungry I get and how I get all the horrible hunger symptoms.\n\nCan anyone with anxiety relate to this? :(\n\nCheers",

I just want to hang out with a few cool people and play video games and stuff, but it just seems like no one does that here.

I will be seeing the same doctor that I saw a year ago, but the thing is I kind of just quit going because I was \"fine now\". This is playing into my fear of going back for some reason I'm scared he is going to hate me and be rude to me (it's an irrational fear I know). I'm fully committed to the processes this time, but my anxiety is in full blown \"RED FLAG\" mode about getting the ball rolling.  Do you guys have any advice or techniques that you use to ease your anxiety in this type of situation?",

            "selftext": "For me, it was one morning three years ago, I was taking a shower.  I couldn't get out of the shower.   I'm not sure what if anything triggered the anxiety panic attack but my brain just refused to process for me how to get out of the shower.  Perhaps I was afraid I was going to be late for work if I couldn't get out of the shower, and well, for a few minutes, I couldn't get out of the shower.\n\nI mean it's usually really easy to get out of a shower.  I normally turn off the water, and in some order, I grab a towel, open the curtain/door, dry off and step out.  My brain would not process this.  I was in the shower turning in circles with the water still on for several minutes.  I was looking for a way out.  A way to escape the shower so I wouldn't be late, and I freaked out.  After several minutes, I started yelling at myself -- Focus, Focus, Focus, and then my brain was like, duh, this is what you do.  Turn off the water...  And I was free of the shower.    \n\nI had another panic attack a few minutes later trying to get dressed because the anxiety was in full swing.  I picked a shirt out of my closet, set it on my bed, turned back to get pants, and then couldn't find my shirt.  It was on my bed where I had set it down, but my brain was worried about being late and getting dressed, and it wouldn't process that it was right where I left it.  I started to freak.  Other options looking back could have been to pull another shirt out of the closet and put it on immediately, use a dirty shirt in the laundry hamper, or go to the car and get a spare shirt I kept there... but no, I had to find this shirt I had picked out, I couldn't find it right there in front of me, and I freaked out.  Again, I started to yell focus focus focus at myself, calmed down and then I found the shirt, right where I left it on the bed in plain sight.",
