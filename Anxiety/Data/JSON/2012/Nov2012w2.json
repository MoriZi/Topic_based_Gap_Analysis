            "selftext": "A few weeks back, I posted a story about an experience I had that left me pretty upset.  I felt inspired by the people who responded to finally attempt to make some positive changes in my life.  I began to realize that my irrational thoughts that have plagued me for the past 11 years were only worsening as I progress through a particularly stressful and important time in my life.  I will be graduating from university at the end of this year, and my anxiety and depression have become absolutely crushing as this part of my life comes to a close.\n\nAnyway, I finally sought out a therapist.  I first saw a psychologist at my school who recommended I see a psychiatrist through my health care provider.  I did so, and first completed an \"intake\" session.  The doctor diagnosed me with GAD, dysthymia, and episodes of major depression (double depression).  I've taken an abnormal psychology class.  I know that double depression is a pretty difficult beast to overcome.  But instead of ducking out of pursuing help like I normally would, I made the next appointment.  The second psychiatrist I saw prescribed 150 mg Wellbutrin for the first week, then 300 mg thereafter (which I started a few days ago).  I also enrolled in a class on overcoming depression, as well as one for anxiety.  I'm trying to muster the motivation to begin journaling.\n\nIt's a strange experience when you begin to actually *feel* your mood.  I don't really know how to explain it, but I am beginning to feel my mood change.  Before this, I never really knew what a \"mood\" felt like.  I only knew utter complacency, anger, and sadness for a very long time.  Actually feeling like I want to wake up in the morning, go on walks, laugh, play with my kitten... something other than lay in bed and sleep for 15+ hours, or finding an excuse to nap at 3PM, sleep until 9PM, then go to bed again at midnight.  I'm obviously only at the beginning stages of getting better, but even small changes are noticeable after coming from the place I was in.\n\nI still have the occasional anxious thought, especially when in crowded places like public transportation ('the guy in the seat behind me has a gun! we're going to crash and die!') or in class.  But I have been learning the practical skills for coping with my irrational thoughts, and it's been really helpful in bringing myself down from an elevated state of anxiety.\n\nThank you so much /r/anxiety. I doubt I would have sought help without the insightful posts and comments here.\n\nIf anyone wants to ask me anything about therapy or anything else, feel free to comment or PM me.\n\nQuick edit:  I forgot to add the thing I was most excited about!  I talked to TWO people today.  That may not seem like a big deal to most, but I would have never done that before.  I struck up a conversation with a guy at the bus stop after I overheard him speaking French, and carried a conversation with him all the way to my stop at home.  I also chatted with a girl in the laundry room.  It felt awesome!",

I don't want to collapse.\n\nShe crunches the numbers, says okay.\n\nAnd I start to crack.  About how much pressure I'm feeling that's put on me.\n\nWhat's she say?\n\n\"I need you to be strong now.  I cry because you're somehow able to hold everything together so well, and I can't have you break now.\"\n\nLike, sorry, seriously?  So exactly WHEN am I able to just let loose with this stuff exactly?\n\nIt just makes me so upset.  Sure, I can handle this (though my sleep has been shot all week now...I need sleeping pills to get to sleep and it SUCKS), but come ON!\n\nI just want to have a break down, get it all off my chest, so I can finally feel free of this mess.\n\nGah! &gt;.&lt;",

            "selftext": "Hi guys. I'm 23 year old Female who works a high stress retail job that is very demanding. I am generally very high strung and am not good at coping. I reside in the US, and I have pretty good insurance. \n\nMy anxiety is always there. It's a companion I haven't been able to shake for a long time, but now there is an elephant in the room and I want him to leave. On Friday night, I got so blackout drunk that apparently I was leaning over my toilet hysterically crying about not wanting to die. I remember snippets, but what really worries me is how adamant I was about not wanting to die.\n\nPost hangover all I feel is like there's a small vibration in the back of my mind and when it snaps, I am going to go insane. I am so paranoid about becoming crazy or schizophrenic that I had a horrible panic attack while driving home this evening from work. I felt like I was tripping. I couldn't concentrate and I called my boyfriend in hysterics. After I realized I was having a panic attack and not going insane, I calmed down a bit. I am prescribed generic Xanax and took .25mg to be able to sit down and coherently type this. The vibration is gone and I feel normal again. \n\nWork and school I think are my biggest triggers, but so are my lack of friends. I really don't know what to do. I have tried breathing exercises and attempted meditation. I also bought a bike to ride around to clear my head. I just honestly don't want to go insane at 23. I'm leaning toward seeing a therapist through my insurance because I am getting to the point where I am unable to function properly. \n\nSo, does anyone else ever feel like this? Am I going insane?",

It would be our fourth time.  Last time we were there, someone made an offhand comment that the strategy she was playing on a particular game was a poor choice, and suggested some other way to play.\n\nFast forward to last night. She starts panicking. She told me she was laying in bed for hours in terror about this.  She just called me and told me that she's purposely going to stay at work until 9pm tonight so she doesn't have to go.\n\nI said we could just not go, that we didn't even have to go at all anymore if she was that worried.  I explained that this guy was just trying to be nice, helping her out.  But no - she insists that every person there now knows who she is and knows that she's a **bad gamer with bad strategy.**  \n\nr/Anxiety, I am trying to be supportive of my wife.  But as someone who doesn't have anxiety myself, I'm not sure exactly what she's feeling.  What can I do or say to help the situation?\n\nAlso, she absolutely refuses to see any doctor about this problem, because she says that the doctor will think she's making all of it up. I've tried to say otherwise, but my attempts to get her to go have fallen on deaf ears.  I have even directed here to this sub, but she thinks \"those people are really crazy, I'm not that bad.\"\n\nReddit, help.  What is my best course of action?",

It's never been anything too bad, besides the occasional social anxiety or test-taking anxiety. \n\nHowever, lately, I feel terrible whenever things don't go as planned and other people are involved. Tonight, my Arabic teacher had a party for everyone in our class at her house. I offered to bring a plate of food to my classmate, since he totally forgot about it. I also offered to drive another classmate back to campus, in order for him not to walk. Unfortunately, I got lost on the way back to campus and it took 20 minutes instead of 5. I kept apologizing for it, while my classmate kept making remarks like, \"haha, I probably could have walked faster...\" I then waited in a parking lot for the classmate I brought food for, but after calling him twice, he texted, \"Uhhhh.....I'm not in my dorm right now...\" after expressing how excited he was to get my Arabic teacher's food.\n\nEven though none of it sounds like that big of a deal, my whole night has been ruined by a fixation on what these two guys think of me. Irrationally, I assume that the classmate I brought food for thinks I'm crazy for calling him twice, and that the other thinks I was trying to trap him into hanging out with me or having a conversation with me by getting completely lost on the way back to a campus I'm familiar with. \n\nHow do stop myself from caring so much about what these two people think? I was doing them both favors by going out of my way, but I still feel that my favors turned into burdens.",

My heart was pounding too hard the whole night. \n\nWednesday it started again the moment I laid down to go to sleep. Instead I went downstairs on the couch and I guess sort of tricked my mind. I was able to get some sleep. The rest of the week went fine.\n\nSo when I couldn't sleep today either, I went downstairs on the couch (TV on and real quiet like last time), but this time nothing happened. And now I'm here.\n\nI get this all the time when I need to get up the next morning, regardless of what it's for. Happened when I had to interview for my current job, happened when I went job counseling at my university over the summer (nothing even stressful about that, but I had to catch an early bus).\n\nI don't know what to do. I took some valerian root and melatonin to help me sleep but they don't do anything. I just started this job so I don't have insurance yet, nor can I just take a sick day and go to a therapist or something. My hours are such that I can't go before or after work really. Those damn therapists have really lazy hours. Don't the know people are at work during their hours?",

It causes pretty intense panic attacks for me, which I have learned to control over the years but whenever something like this happens, I pretty much freak out and there's not much I can do about it. I also have GAD, and chronic stomach problems (which of course, doesn't help my phobia) that are not serious, but very annoying.\n\nAlso, just to note, I am currently seeing a psychologist and she is wonderful. My anxiety does not generally interfere with my every day life anymore unless something like this happens.\n\n\nAnyone else have this phobia? I hear it's fairly common...what can I do to calm myself down right now?\n\n\n\n**EDIT: Wow, thank you all for responding! I can't believe how many of us deal with this phobia**",

Then had the worst panic attack of my life after stress/smoking weed and the lexapro stopped working.  They put me on paxil, it was horrible. Went back to lexapro but on 20mg, still didn't help.  Then recently went on Effexor 75mg which was ok as far as side effects go but did'nt feel THAT much better so they upped it to 150mg and After about a month on that I didn't feel like it was much of a difference.  So here I stand now with a new prescription for 200mg of Zoloft predicting the shit storm of a journey this will be to begin while weening off of effexor.  Any positive stories with Zoloft would help, but just wanted to vent a little because I'm fucking tired of this bullshit.  I was fine on the lexapro for so long...living life to the fullest and then one drastic panic attack and I'm back in hell for the past 6 months.  Fun Fun anxiety!

If it was truly me causing this anxiety, then it wouldn't be what was best for myself. It seems like the more I'm stressed or nervous about something, the more the anxiety seems to take over and the more stressed I get. It's a vicious cycle. That's why I think it's not part of a person. It's a parasitic energy blob that has just decided to attach itself to you and feeds off of your fear.
