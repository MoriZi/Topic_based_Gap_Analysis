            "selftext": "A couple of weeks ago, I overheard a conversation between a few of my friends. They were having a discussion about a play we had read in class, specifically on a character who was debated to have some sort of mental illness. This then turned into a discussion solely on mental illness and mental disorders, and how the western world has exploited the term and uses it as a copout to being a contributing member of society. They then decided to just go out and say it: \"Anxiety and depression are both first world problems, and people just seriously need to get over it. They aren't real ailments, so get the hell over yourself.\"\nNow, they all very well know I struggle with anxiety. They also knew I was in the room. I said nothing throughout the whole discussion, but 10 minutes later, I walked out of the house without saying a word.\n\nNow, I don't know about you, but I'm getting pretty sick and tired of people who have no idea what its like to live with a mental disorder judging others who live with them every single day. NO ONE who struggles with these disorders wants them, so what gives you the right to tell someone to 'get over it'? No. Not okay, and it will never be okay. I struggle with chronic GAD, and have been for a few years, and  none of them know the true extent of how much my anxiety has crippled my ability to preform in school. Its changed my personality, and has recently drawn me away from social situations. There isn't an immediate solution to 'fixing' a disorder that consumes you so fully. It can be so overwhelming, and these people don't get how hard it can be to live with it.\n\nPeople all over the world deal with anxiety, and although it is proven that western countries have more treated cases, it doesn't give you a right to slap such a negative label on it. its a serious problem in a lot of lives, and needs to be treated delicately, just like you would any ailment.\n\nNobody wants anxiety, so to those of you who think we do this for attention, you can fuck off.\n\nI'm gonna go cry into my pillow now.\n\nEdit: Wow, I seriously wasn't expecting this many people to reply! Thank you all for your support, advice and words of wisdom. Unfortunately, I know these people will never truly understand where I am coming from, but I now know that there are many of you who get what I'm saying and live with the same disorder I do. I will continue pushing to get better, continue my therapy and medication, and try to focus more of my energy on those who actually care about my wellbeing. Again, gratitude to every single one of you who has sent kindness my way. Namaste. ",

            "selftext": "For thanksgiving I visited my parents, who live about five hours away from where I currently do. I had to work at 11:00 today (small coffee shop/restaurant), and the plan was for me to wake up at 4:00 am and drive back so I could enjoy Thanksgiving dinner with my family and make it to work on time.\n\nBy 4:00 I had slept less than two hours due to stressing about the drive and other family issues. I started panicking and crying, knowing that I was going to have a full on panic attack if I attempted the drive (I've dozed off at the wheel before, which is terrifying and something I never want to do again.) My mom and I decided that calling in sick so I could get some sleep and drive up later would be the best plan of action.\n\nI called at 7:00 am (we open at 6:30 and I was so nervous and guilty about calling in), and it turned out someone else scheduled today had already called in sick. My boss had some choice words for me, especially when she found out I was still five hours away and \"couldn't make it if I tried\" (her words), especially when she \"gave me the whole week off,\" (not true, we were closed Thursday, a coworker who owed me a favor worked for me on Tuesday, and I happened to have Monday off. The only day I requested off was Wednesday.) \n\nI don't blame her for being upset. I feel like I've let down my boss, my fellow employees, my family, and most of all myself. I worry that I might not have a job after this, which is fine when you're 16 and still live with your parents. I'm 24, with a (useless) bachelor's degree, and this was the only job I can get while I attend more school to try and make my degree less useless. I now realize how stupid of me it was to think that I could actually wake up that early and get to work on time with my history of anxiety and trouble sleeping. \n\nAnd this is what I hate the most about anxiety, and all mental disorders. Things that seem so easy for everyone else, like making phone calls or even just sleeping, become huge obstacles. And I can't tell my boss what's really going on because I know she won't care or believe me. I'm watching all my peers become successful adults while I can't even make it to my shitty barista job. I know I am capable of so much more but the littlest things are so hard and sometimes I just want to give up.\n\nI'm currently typing this at a busy Starbucks about 1/3 of the way home. I still feel awful and am having trouble concentrating on the road. I dread going to work tomorrow and especially Monday, when my boss will be back. I don't really know what to do, I just want my bed and my cat. \n\nThank you so much for reading this, I do feel a little better after typing it out. Huge hugs to everyone who struggles like I do, I hope your Black Friday is going better than mine. ",

Then I'm going to get it through my head that *I AM ON TOP OF EVERYTHING*. Then I'm going to do whatever the fuck I want to do, because I have nothing I need to do.\n\nYeah.\n\nGoodnight.",

            "selftext": "Since most doctors don't really tell this I would like to just inform you quick about the reasons behind these symptoms. **I am no doctor, I have no education in this. I've just been lucky enough to have a few good doctors (and many bad). If I'm wrong, please correct me. I don't have any sources for this, this is all in my head since I learned it. I do not speak perfect english since I'm swedish, so corrections are welcomed but try not being to harsh.**\n\n**1. Chest pain**\n\nWhen you work out too much, what happens? Your muscles gets tired - everyone knows this. Nothing strange about that one. So if you for example trains your bicep, and it gets tired - it will tell you to not use it anymore by hurting. Everyone knows this aswell. So what do you do? Do you keep using it? No, you will probably try to not use it until the pain has gone.\n\nSame things goes with all your muscles. The muscles around your lungs and below are supposed to be used for moving the lungs when breathing. **The little tiny muscles between your ribs and collarbones are *not***. They are supposed to help moving your arms and neck. \n\nSo what happens when you get nervous/anxious? You start breathing with tiny movements and move your ribs instead of your stomage. You will breath \"too high up\", or what to call it in english. So instead of using these big and strong muscles that's below your lungs, you use these tiny and weak muscles around your ribs and collarbones that are supposed to only support the neck/arm movements.\n\nWhen these muscles get tired, they will try to tell you this by starting to hurt. But since you can't just stop breathing, they will continue to hurt. And you will continue to breath. This will make your muscles more and more tired. And what does tired muscles do? They contract. And do you know what happens when *one* muscle starts to contract? It will automatically pull the edges of the muscle next to it (since all muscles are connected like chains), and the muscle next to it will answer by pulling back.\n\nSo when it feels like *\"something is wrapped around your ribs\"*, it's not just a feeling - it actually **is** something wrapped around them. Your own muscles are actually wrapped around your chest.\n\n**2. Digestive problems**\n\nWhen you suffering from anxiety you might get a hard time at the toilet, you might have diarrhea, or you might have a hard time to \"do your business\". All this comes from the same problem as the chest pain - you don't breath right. Instead of using the big strong muscles around and below your lungs, you breath with tiny and fast breaths at the chest. When you do this, you don't use your diaphragm. The diaphragm is the big muscle located right under you lungs. This muscle is the one that SHOULD be used when breathing, and it has more purposes then that. The diaphragm is located right over your intestines, so every time you move it - it will massage your intestines, and your guts actually depends on this massage to function properly.\n\nSo your diarrhea is actually a result of intestines that gets too little attention from the rest of the body. I know it's hard to breath properly the whole day, even for someone not suffering from anxiety, but try to do it just for a while, maybe 15 minutes at the end of the day. It will help.\n\nAlso eating more fiber is good, since this helps with the \"intestine-massage\".\n\n**3. Head ache**\n\nAgain, if we move back to what I wrote in the first part. When you breathe inproperly, you use the muscles around your collarbones. When these muscles get tired, they will pull them self together, and also start pulling in the muscle next to them. This will start a chainreaction of different muscles pulling each other.\n\nThis leads to that the more tired the first muscle gets, the more it pulls, and the more tired the second muscle get, and the more *that* muscle pulls. \n\nOutside of your head bone, you probably like most of the people think it's just skin, but actually there is a large but flat muscle on each side of your head (as big as your hand, I think). You can probably not feel it, and I'm sorry but I have forgotten this muscles name, but I think it begins with A.\n\nWhen the muscles in your neck gets tired, they will eventually pull this muscle. So when it feels like there's something wrapped around your head and giving a pressure, again - there actually *is* something wrapped around your head. There actually *is* something that gives a pressure around your head. Your own muscles, once again.\n\nWhen you notice this, remember to try to breath correctly. To help the pain ease, massage helps. Just put your fingertips at the sides of your head and move them around in little circles. Also an ordinary neck massage helps a lot.\n\n**Other reasons for head ache**\n\nAnother of the most common reasons for head ache is that you just haven't been drinking enough. Remember, your body is supposed to always be a *liiiiiittle* bit thirsty - **when you stop being thirst, it means that you are dehydrated**. There is some scientific reason behind this but I won't get into that now. However, if you haven't learned it yet learn it now. When you notice that \"Hey, I haven't drank anything in 7 hours and I'm not the least thirsty\" - it means that you already is dehydrated. So drink, drink, drink!\n\n(*Just don't drink **too** much, that will just destroy your organs. When they say 3 liters a day, that means 3 liters **including** the water you get through your food.**)\n\nAlso it can be from staring at a computer/tv for far to long. For your eyes and your brains sake, look away from the screen for 30-60 seconds  (more is great but that's enough, and I'm sure even the WoWplayers can get 30 seconds left over sometimes) once in a while, preferly every 30th minute but do it just as often as you can.\n\n**4. Unbalance**\n\nMany times when you feel unbalanced it's just as simple as the fact that your feet don't have any connection to the ground. But down your feet to the floor (this works best if you don't wear shoes, and especially on a carpet, grass, stones or any other patterned area) and start feeling with your toes on the ground. By this, you will tell your body that \"it's safe here\"'.\n\nEven if you feel safe in a place, when your body don't have any ground connection anymore if will automatically feel unsecured. This is a natural instinct.\n\nAlso, you might need more blood in your hands and feet. Buy a [massageball](http://resources.sport-tiedje.com/bilder/kettler/massageball_set_detail.jpg) and either place it on the ground and roll your foot over it, or place it in your hand and just roll it around between your palms. You can use it for many other things, many more advanced, but this simple thing is all you need to do.\n\n*Pro tip: Massageballs are often expensive, but you can often find dog toys that are really cheap that looks just the same! (Everything that looks the same as them, works the same. It's nothing special with the balls that are sold for massage*\n\n**Other ways to trick your brain**\n\nRemember this - everything your brain get as information, is real to it. The brain doesn't seperate fiction from fact. That's why you get scared when you watch a scary movie, becuase even if *you* know it's not for real, your brain thinks that there actually is a murder infront of you.\n\nSo when you think \"maybe I fuck this up\", \"maybe i'll die\", \"maybe someone will kill me\", \"maybe i'm worthless\", your brain will not think \"the owner of me is thinking she will die\". The brain will think \"we will die\". So it will automatically starts to prepare the body for dying, if you don't do anything to stop it. When you do things that the brain autumatically associates with fear, like breathing quick and with tiny breaths, this will just make this even stronger.\n\nSo - what are the body doing when it's calm? I guess you all have at least somewhere you feel safe, how bad your anxiety even might be. Maybe it's in your mothers lap, sleeping next to your husband, walking the dog etc. When you feel safe - notice your body. Notice what it does. How it feels. How does it use its muscles? How do you breath? Remember this, and try to do this when you feel you start panic.\n\nOne easy thing is to breath with pauses. This is the things that's the effective part in square-breathing (I guess you all know what square-breathing is so I won't go into it, if anyone doesn't know just tell me and I'll tell you). When you breath with pauses, it's a **very** effective way of tricking your brain into thinking \"I'm safe here\". Just take a deep breath and hold it in for a few seconds, breath out and **hold it for a few seconds**(*it's important to do it also when you breath out*). I've never used square breathing but I've used this. The square has never made much sense to me.",

I had barely any anxiety symptoms, and even felt the need to volunteer in my second class to read out loud from our book. I was so calm it was weird, and then at that point I for sure thought I took the correct pill.\n\nThen I get home and finally have time to google which pill was actually which, and I come to find out I actually took the Ibuprofen instead. I was completely shocked! How was that even possible? I felt like maybe just the fact that I took a pill that I presumed to be for handling my anxiety, my brain just went with it. Kind of like a sugar pill or non alcoholic beer that dumb teenagers think is alcoholic. I'm not sure if Ibuprofen somehow lessened my anxiety? I'm not even sure if it does that. Or it was just my brain and body thinking I handled my problem and just accepting that fact and going with it.\n\nI am still completely shocked and slightly confused, and thought this was interesting enough to share. I would love to hear your guys' thoughts on this..",

Pain in my chest set in, it became harder to breathe, I started focusing on all the bad things that could happen if I wrote a bad paper or missed a deadline (most of them very much exaggerated). I sat down on the floor trying to collect myself. I grabbed a notebook and started writing out what I was thinking and how I was going to fix my paper. I kept focusing on how doable the solution was and just kept writing until I could breathe again. I was/am so relieved that it calmed me down.

I felt really shaky and my heart was absolutely pounding in the car. \n\nRight now I feel pretty tranquil because I took a xanax 0.5 on the way back.

Fair enough, most people don't. I can honestly say that I have reached a better place without his help, but things don't turn around over night. I still have relapses and irrational/obsessive thoughts. I get anxious when I want to communicate these thoughts because I am afraid of upsetting him. He gets frustrated when he I feel this way because he thinks I have no reason to feel this way. He also gets very defensive if it might be n irrational thought about him. I tried to explain to him that I don't actually believe my thoughts wholeheartedly, but I need some reassurance to make them go away.\n\nWhen e gets frustrated and defensive, I kind of shut down. It's a self protective measure. Instead of thinking \"Hey, I know you're frustrated, but just relax. This isn't about you.\" I think \"Omg, I'm just making things worse. He hates me. I should just disappear (me shutting down).\" \n\nAlso, when he gets into his negative moods, he tends to pull away, leaving me in the dark. I know he needs his space, but I feel anxious about approaching him. I just end up mirroring his actions, which also frustrates him at times because he hates when I just pull away rather than speak up. I also tend to pull away because he often says \"I don't know what to say or do\" or \"you have to try to help yourself sometimes.\" I know all of these things, but they make me feel like I am on my own. I don't expect him to fix anything, but I would like comfort sometimes.\n\nAnyway, how do I communicate better while battling that inner anxious voice? How do I help him understand that sometimes his actions affect how I want to approach him? and I do I do this without getting into old habits?\n\nAny thoughts would be appreciated! ",
