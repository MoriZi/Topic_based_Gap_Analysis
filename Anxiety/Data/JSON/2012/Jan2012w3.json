Im 20 years old, starting University and have had mild-moderate anxiety since I was 14.\n\nI never thought Id be prescribed medication since my anxiety symptoms are only really bad when Im trying to make friends or get to know people on a personal level. Going to University has my anxiety pretty managable as long as I didnt talk to anyone but I didnt want to have a lonely University expierence and opted in to try some meds to relieve some social anxiety and get to know people and make friends. Well I went to my gp and he prescribed me celexa and now Im scared t take it. Im afraid of the side effects getting in the way of my school work and grades. Another fear I have is that the anxiety will change who I am and when I eventually stop taking them I will revert to the old me and people will start to hate me. I also feel like Ive failed but I think a large part of that thought process is because I have a slight taboo of medication. Any one have a similar experience to mine?\n\nPS. I dont know why I was prescribed an anti depressant since I have never been depressed in my life",

My desire for a friend is so severe; wherever I go, I look at everyone and wonder how I could make friends with them, and I get jealous when I see a group of people walking together. \n\nI don't want to seem too desperate, so when I talk to people I try not to ask too many questions and just act cool. Or I just don't talk to anyone at all and wait for people to talk to me which never happens. \n\nI cry hard at least once a week. Yesterday I cried when I was walking to my car at my college (it was at night and not many others were around). I also cried in the shower later. \n\nWhat kills me is for SOME reason, I'm terrified of people thinking that I'm a loner or desperate for friends, so I try to act like I have a social life..... even to my family, I'll lie and say I'm meeting up with people when really I just go to the bookstore or something by myself. \n\nOnce or twice, I've gotten to the point where I talk to a certain person in my class every day, but before I know it, the semester is over and we never talk to each other again. So getting to the first part is hard, but staying in contact with people seems impossible. \n\nAny advice, or people with the same problem? :(",

I'm always extremely quiet and awkward the first few times I talk to new people because I can never seem to think of things to say that I dont think will make me sound stupid. (though eventually I'll open up and feel like I can be myself) \n\nThis feeling of not being able to open up to people has led to a lot of fights with people I've dated because they feel like I'm avoiding them, when in reality, I was just anxious about talking to them. \n\nEven now, I'm typing this alone in the university library because, for no apparent reason, I dont feel like going home and hanging out with my friends there. \n\nThis has never really bothered me before, I was content to be the quiet loner with a few close friends, but lately I have gotten sick of it. I recently realized that, after 4 years in college, I haven't really made friends with anyone in any of my classes, and have become somewhat withdrawn from some of my good friends lately. I hate being this way. I want to get myself out there, make more connections and be the person I want to be.\n\nDoes anyone have any advice as to how I can overcome/deal with this?

            "selftext": "I've always been an anxious person, but about a year ago I tried k2, thinking it was marijuana, and I had a bad trip.  Then I tried marijuana a few weeks later and had a bad anxiety attack.  I didn't get the attack when I was high, but when I was high, I was extremely spacy and my heart rate was very high.  I thought I was having another bad trip.  So after a week and the effects weren't wearing off, I finally had a panic attack, thinking I was losing my mind.  \n\nI sent myself to a hospital and was on anti depressants and anti psychotics for several months, since I told them I thought I was psychotic, since I had read about the symptoms online...\n\nNow I'm not taking any medication or anything but I still have some concerns.  Aftyer reading so much into mental illnesses like schizophrenia I'm constantly worried that I'm going to get them.  Sometimes I feel like I'm going to lose control or space out again and it's rather uncomfortable.  \n\nAlso, when I look at the sky or a bright screen I can see small bright dots flitting in and out of my vision, like eye floaters but smaller.  Also small flashes of light as well.  \n\nOnto the next topic, my obsession.  I've always been obsessive but it was never really a problem until I got into my first relationship.  I was a christian and my gf was agnostic.  I read a verse that said 'do not be unequally yoked with unbelievers' and I could not get it out of my head.  I tried not to think about it but it kept cropping up and it made my life hell.  I would lay awake at night with worry, questioning everything about the verse.  I read it over and over and analyzed it over and over, read so many different interpretations and I just couldn't get it out of my head.  So I broke up with her...\n\nBut then I started obsessing more over religion.  I renounced christianity because I always had my doubts and this pushed me.  However then I started thinking about islam, and the same thing happened.  I didn't want to be a muslim, still don't.  But the idea of it I can't stop thinking about.  I'm constantly obsessing over things I always loved, wondering if I can be happy when doing them, if perhaps they are sinful or something and I just can't stop obsessing.  \n\nDo you guys have any advice? :/",

            "selftext": "Hello. I am sorry if I get a little sloppy writing this, I have so many things to say. I'll try to keep it organized. (Also, I am 14. Please don't judge me for my age, I am not dumb. I was actually extremely nervous to post my age due to the fact teenagers are stereotyped a lot. lease don't make me regret it).\n\nI am a male who has not had a haircut for years. My hair is down past my shoulders, and I hate it. The issue is, because of my hair, I have always been seen as \"that weird guy\", and I started avoiding people in order to avoid a potential rude comment about my hair. Now, I rarely go out in public, and if I do I actually start shaking and avoiding eye contact or talking.\n\nSo, why don't I just get my hair cut? Because I cannot go out in public without having a breakdown. Even being near people I don't know makes me shake. Having them watch me get a haircut, and one touching me would probably make me black out. \n\nMy life has been so routine that I don't even know what I'm doing most of the time. I am constantly thinking, endlessly creating fantasies where I have friends, have a life, and maybe even a girlfriend. I hate not being aware. I always feel out of it.\n\nMy grades started dropping in 6th grade, my hair was already long then, but almost all my friends from elementary went to a separate school due to location. I had made some friends, but not many. I tried to find out why my grades were dropping, keep in mind I was not being bullied so I was pretty sure it was some type of focus issue.\n\nThen, during the winter break, I had a breakdown. I couldn't go back to school. I was sweating every time I thought about going back. After many long talks with my parents, I ended up getting homeschooled. I do not like being homeschooled, but I need an education, and when I have the choice of getting bad grades at a public school, or better grades at home, I chose the latter. And I have been getting good grades, but I feel even more isolated from society now then before, because I am.\n\nAbout a year ago, I started wondering what I would look like without long hair, because I am very unattractive with my current hair. I took my hoodie, tucked my hair away so only the ends would show on my forehead, and I was shocked. I actually look good! When my parents were not home, I started having 1-2 hour long periods in the bathroom where I would just admire this new found me. (I still do).\n\nI think I thought of this new me as another person, and thought of him as a friend. Yes, I became my own friend. Eventually I even started having my short haired self try to talk some sense into my long haired self. I was arguing in the mirror with myself, trying to get myself to see how logical it is to get a haircut, but my mind seems to just hit a roadblock every time, and I would start thinking about what I would change if I could go back in time, which is ridiculous.\n\nI hate change. That is another reason I feel I can't get a haircut. I don't like being the center of attention, and a change like a haircut for me would be very hard to cope with. I also want to go back to school, but if I get a haircut and go, I can't even imagine the people I used to know's reactions, who have only known me with long hair.\n\nI feel desperate. I have even, and this is going to sound pathetic because it is, though of faking an injury to my head so I could maybe pretend I didn't know who I was and cut off my hair, then magically go back to normal.\n\nI have never done drugs, I live in a good area, and my parents are together. I feel selfish a lot of the time, making others worry about me because I'm afraid to get a haircut.\n\nAlso, **please** do not tell me to suck it up and go. The last time  went to the dentist, I had been sweating so much there was a spot on the waiting room chair, and no one was in the waiting room other then my mom and a lady reading a magazine. I honestly think if I try going into a crowded Greatclips I will faint, or run away halfway through the haircut.\n\nI've been to therapy, but it didn't help at all. If anything, it made me worse. I am not depressed though. I love life, the mere thought of ending it is ridiculous. I also have never cut myself, Loosing valuable plasma is not going to help me in any way.\n\nWhy do I refuse to get a haircut, even after all of this?\n",

            "selftext": "Hey guys, thanks for taking the time to stop by. \n\nI had my first couple of panic attacks 2 years ago (currently 21) and naturally, having had no idea what i was experiencing, went straight to the ER. Since then, general anxiety and the occasional attack seemed to be cyclical. I'd go for a week or two feeling semi-ok, then things would be terrible for a few days and on and on we'd go. \n\nRecently, however, things have become much much worse. I spent 325 dollars out of pocket to see a psychiatrist only to leave feeling absolutely hopeless. I was prescribed 2.5mg Olanazpine (Zyprexa) only to come home and read about the drug. It horrified me and I don't think I can bring myself to take them. I have a prescription for clonazepam wafers and have taken 3 over the course of 16 months. If haven't picked up on it already, I am terrified of medication. For several reasons I guess. \n\nAt this point, I really do not know what to do. I'm not even really sure what I am looking for. I've tried CBT for several months and saw no real improvement. Might you guys have any good books to recommend? Does anyone ever beat this, or is it only ever managed? At this point, I'd be willing to steal an outlook on life that is not my own if it might help cope. \n\nThoughts, opinions, suggestions would be so helpful. I don't have anyone in my life, family or friends, to go to, even for just pleasantries, which only seems to compound things. Thanks guys, I really appreciate it.  ",

            "selftext": "I have a severe problem with worrying/anxiety with people that are very close to me. It affects my mom, dad, brother and now girlfriend. Anytime I call them, and they don't answer, I immediately go to the worst case scenario. Sometimes I have called over and I've again until I know they're ok.\u00a0\n\nI live with my brother, so I also have that fear anytime I come home and he's not there. Sometimes, \u00a0( and he's a night owl) I literally can't go to sleep until I know he's at our house. I guess it boils down to I'm terrified if they are in a dangerous spot- that's why I have to always check on them. It's not normal, and it feels like hell when I'm experiencing it.\u00a0\n\nI saw a psychologist for six months, and was put on some meds that seemed to work at the time. I'm still on them, and while the attacks don't occur as frequently, they appear sometimes out of the blue, just as severe.\u00a0I also fear this is putting a burden on my family, and I feel so guilty about it.\u00a0\n\nSo, if anyone on here has experienced this, or has dealt with it successfully, or has any ideas to break this. I know it's not healthy, and I would like to just live in peace for once without making up horror stories in my mind.\u00a0\n",

            "selftext": "I'm going to keep this are short but as informative as possible. I would like some advice on what I can do to help my sister overcome her anxiety disorder. \n\nFor the past few months she has gotten progressively worse and just today she checked into a hospital where she can get some help, hopefully. But, she spends most of her days either sleeping or watching TV. She does go to college but as of this year she switched to a community college and lives at home. I know that she suffers from anxiety because of the conversations I've had with her but at this point I don't know what I can do to help. I have a basic understanding of anxiety and how it effects her specifically, which is no matter how good a situation is the negatives nearly almost always outweigh the positives. Then she can't push the negative thoughts away. \n\nShe is on medication, something along the lines of Prozac, and seeing therapy but I don't think she is completely honest with the therapist. She isn't honest with her family either and some days she can get very nasty and breakdown in tears. I recognize that if she was honest with us that the situation would be easier to comprehend and make better. But in my opinion she probably isn't very honest with her self either. I think she tells us what she thinks we want to hear. \n\nI truly do appreciate any sort of feedback. \ntl;dr: what's the best way to help a family member with severe anxiety who isn't completely honest.

            "selftext": "Since this is such a commonly asked question, and this method worked wonders for me, I wanted to share it with everyone. \n\nMy therapist gave me a great way to handle anxiety attacks, but it definitely takes a little practice before it's completely effective, as you really have to concentrate.\n\nWhen you feel that tightening in your chest, pick an object and stare at it. Any object, I've found that plants work best, so I'll use that as an example. Now, without touching it, just consider it for a moment. Start to imagine how the plant would feel if you were holding it in your hand. Is it in a pot? How would the pot feel? How heavy do you think if it was in your hands right that moment? Now, how would the rest of the plant feel? Does it have flowers? How delicate are the petals? Continue until you have mentally \"felt\" the plant entirely.\n\nThen, hit every other sense. How would it smell if you were far away? Closer? If you rustled the petals/leaves, what would it sound like? If you put a piece in your mouth, how would it taste? Bitter? Sweet?\n\nAt that point, you should be completely distracted from whatever anxiety you had before. Usually, the taste part makes me laugh a bit too.\n\nLike I said, this takes practice- it won't work perfectly the first time you try. You'll get better at it with every time you need it, and feel free to practice it even when you aren't anxious- it'll make you better for when the time comes. Until then, keep paper bags everywhere, as that's the great scientific way of stopping those attacks :)\n\nThis happens with me when I let everything building up and building up and it seems like you have the weight of the world on top of you. I get stressed about something little and it turns fearing my boyfriend dumping me and my mom dying and it snowballs. You have to try to stop yourself. Tell yourself (out loud if need be) that those connections are ONLY IN YOUR MIND and are not going to come to fruition. With practice, you'll stop making those connections and will be able to make your anxiety a lot smaller.\n",
