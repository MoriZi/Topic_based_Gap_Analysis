            "selftext": "I went for an appointment with my school psychiatrist yesterday, who I will be seeing regularly over the summer. I was discussing how difficult I found it to come into college, how anxious and self-conscious I can feel just walking around busy parts of campus. I explained that I fear seeing people I know. It's hard to describe exactly why I feel so anxious about seeing people that I know. I have pretty much dropped out this year of college (something I've done for the second time now), and although I have really never said a word to ANYONE in my class, I see them all the time. I suppose I feel anxious about what they might think upon seeing me; \"where has he been\" or \"look at him weirdly wandering around by himself again\". It's hard to communicate via text why these might inspire such anxiety, but I do know that encountering certain members of my class does result in huge anxiety. \n\nThat was part of why I had to drop out, just making my way in and out of and around college was such a draining experience. Whenever in there, I would hide away where I was sure noone would see me and waste time on the internet for hours and hours. When I explained that I found the encounter awkward, and the way that you strain to avoid eye contact with this person, even though you only know them to see, he identified that feeling as shame. It was weird to describe one of these encounters (of which I've had hundreds) as such a simple word. Before I've tried to describe them as socially awkward, embarassing, self-conscious. It's weird to see all of those things put in perspective simply by attaching the word \"shame\". And that was exactly it. There are so many aspects of my life of which I am ashamed. Since I've regressed back into this period of moderate social reclusion, I just spend time all day cringing in shame over nearly any past social encounter that I can think of. I'm ashamed of my former self, my dependence on my family, my lack social contact... it almost seems that If it is associated with me in any way, I am ashamed of it. \n\nI'm an incredibly self-conscious person with incredibly low self-esteem, and although I can put myself out there with an artificial facade of an interesting life, friends and mild confidence, it's just a thin veil covering a life of which I am nearly totally ashamed. I need to learn to change the way I feel about myself and my life to move forward.\n\nI just thought I'd share this, when he mentioned it yesterday it seemed to put the source of nearly all my anxiety into a certain perspective.\n",

I feel nauseous seriously all the time, even when I don't have anything to actually be worried about.  There are very few moments when I *don't* feel like I'm going to be sick.  The feeling gets way worse when I actually have something legitimate to be nervous about, like a job interview or something... those times are like debilitating, I just can't pull myself together and end up getting shaky and it's just a really awful feeling.\n\nI tried citalopram a couple years ago, and on the bright side it got rid of my constant nauseous feeling and improved my general mood (made me worry a lot less about the ridiculous small things I usually spend hours each day obsessing over....), but, the negatives outweighed the postives for me honestly.  I didn't feel necessarily calmed down like I've heard some people say, instead it was the opposite, I felt like... wild, I just had this feeling of not giving a fuck about the consequences of anything I did, which I think was brought on by the citalopram because once I stopped taking it, that feeling went away and I returned to being my cautious self.\n\nMy question is this: has anyone been able to control their anxiety without medication?  I really don't like what taking medication did to me so I'd like to avoid it if possible.  I know there are other options besides citalopram, but I'd just really prefer to try and do it myself, I really don't want my decision making or sex drive or anything to be affected by medication.  I just don't know if the constant anxiety I have is even something that can be helped by a non-medicinal solution alone. I do smoke trees so if I'm at home and I have an anxiety attack, I'll smoke a bowl which definitely gets rid of my nausea.  But, of course that isn't really an option when I'm at work, which is why I'm trying to find a solution to get my anxiety under control.\n\n**TL;DR** Has anyone been able to manage their anxiety without meds?  Sorry for all the text, I just felt it might help if I explained my own situation a little bit.",

            "selftext": "I've had anxiety problems, mostly related to health, for my entire life. I've been in and out of therapy since I was 7. I also have been taking medicine for my anxiety, on and off, since then. That's helped, but only to cover the physical symptoms. \n\nWhen I say I've had hypochondria for my entire life, I mean it. My mom likes to bring up the time I informed her I had a brain tumor when I was about 4 or 5 after seeing a show about it. It's a fear that I've never really gotten over. I used to beg to go to the hospital/doctor when I was a kid for literally anything. It never worked...\n\nThe rest of my health anxieties and other worries include, but are not limited to\n- appendicitis (despite having already had my appendix removed)\n- aneurysms\n- anaphylactic shock \n- asthma attack\n- blood clots\n- brain tumors\n- cancer\n- car crash \n- food allergy\n- food poisoning\n- going permenantly insane\n- heart attack \n- heart failure\n- kidney stones\n- Multiple Sclerosis\n- pregnancy\n\nI have these constant thoughts, seeing these situations play out so vividly in my head. I see myself or people that I know having these awful things happening to them, and there's nothing I can do.\n\nI've also recently started projecting these fears onto others in the worst way, so not only am i obsessively worrying about my own health, I'm also worrying about theirs, and generally annoying the hell out of them. \n\nMy parents, especially, are the kind of tough that only the 1950s could produce. I mean the type that could walk off a ten story fall with a little tylenol. As a result, I worry about them endlessly. It was a weird mix of personalities growing up. \n\nI've gotten to where I can't do anything without having a fear attached. I can't even try new foods because I am so terrified of being allergic to them. I have very definite physical symptoms related to my anxiety problems, including panic attacks and getting sick to my stomach nearly every time I eat. This shit is ruining my life. \n\nI guess that's all I can think of right now. I try to make note of them as they come up, to give to my (future) therapist. \nAnyway, I was feeling really rough and I just wanted to talk about it, writing really helps me. \n\n-Thanks for the time\n\nTL;DR: I may be a basket case",

My coworker asked if I was \"really cold\" because I looked that way, but I was just so so tense.\n\nNow that I've gotten my klonopin refilled, I feel normal. Still anxious, but functioning.

With the end of the semester coming, what was a somewhat manageable amount of anxiety has become overwhelming. It has become fairly obvious that I need to get help dealing with it.

At this point I'm fairly sure its the best option for me as my anxiety has made college pretty difficult. I guess I'm just looking for some reassurance that I'm doing the right thing here.

Recently, my doctors have told me that my diagnosis is bullshit and I should never have been put in special classes.\n\n* Another girl befriended several of my cousins after meeting me and would talk badly about me\n\n* Another girl convinced my grandmother she should sell a gift she got me and keep the money, because she thought I was spoiled. \n\n* Same girl above told me (when I had depression really seriously and was seeking counselling) to go kill myself.\n\n These are people I have known for over 10 and 20 years. I am 25.\n\nNow, I have trouble talking with anybody. Whenever I do, I assume they think the worst of me.

            "selftext": "I'm pretty sure I have some sort of anxiety(maybe GAD), I've never really been diagnosed but I meet most of the symptoms. My biggest concern right now is that I've never had sex because of it. I'm pretty sure its because when I was about 17(20 now) I was about to have sex with a girl but I couldn't get an erection. I was horny and everything but whatever I did I couldn't seem to get achieve one. Now this fear has followed me throughout. Most of the time, I'll completely avoid any type of situation that I know will lead to sex. I was once making out with a girl in a bar for an entire night and as soon as she had asked me to come home with her my heart sank, became completely sweaty and couldn't get the idea of not performing out of my head. I declined, and felt like a complete idiot.(probably made her feel pretty bad too) Whenever I'm in the situation, I get extremely shaky, sweaty, my heart beats a million times a minute. At this point I think I just need to \"get back on the horse\" and keep trying. But I'm curious to see if others have experienced this and what advice they can offer me.\n\nTL;DR: Couldn't get an erection once in my first sexual experience, can't shake the idea of it happening again and avoid sexual encounters.\n\nEDIT: Thank you everyone, all your responses are very much appreciated.

On rare occasions I'll have sweet tea, or a coke, or some coffee. Today I was feeling a bit anxious, my head was cloudy and my mind couldn't focus really on one particular thing. I decided that I wanted a coke with my dinner tonight, and about an hour afterwards, I felt a lot more relaxed. I decided to pick up some work that I had, and could easily focus on one thing at a time, and my mind was generally free of fog. \n\nHas anyone else had an experience similar? ",

Two problems : one its  not going to be efficient or work very well to do a good job, two due to anxiety,a touch of OCD and ADD I stick to routines as much as possible to cope , routines keep me focused and calm.\n\nAnd due to being a creature of habit, changes in routines are hard to cope with , I have to ease into something or I can't cope with the change well.\n\nIm just wondering if anyone else uses established routines to cope with anxiety and have trouble when things change.",
