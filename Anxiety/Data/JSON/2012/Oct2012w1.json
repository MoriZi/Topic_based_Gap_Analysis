            "selftext": "**originally posted to r/depression but is still completely relevant**\n\nWell I kind of new it from experience but now that its been given to me as a fact I feel like sticking my finger up to the world that has told me to stop being such a downer.\n\nI am on medication currently for my anxiety/depression and I have never felt this \"normal\" before. I have always been up and down depressed and anxious all through my teens. At my worst I used to imagine vivid imagery of death, I used to google world statistics of all the horrible things in the world and go on about them to others, I'd search pictures of decapitated bodies and horrifying artworks and I self harmed. I could have not concentrated so much on these things but it wouldn't stop the flood of negative thought.\n**anxiety edit: My anxiety stopped me from studying, I was so afraid of failing my school work that I was too anxious to do anything else but I was too anxious to do my schoolwork at the same time, it was a vicious cycle.**\n\nWith disorders you cannot simply \"stop thinking\" negatively. It is near impossible. It is not just like experiencing normal stress where you can , otherwise depression wouldn't be an actual disorder or illness at all. It is one thing to feel depressed/anxious, which is completely normal, but to be depressed or have anxiety disorder is an ongoing thing that floods you with uncontrollable negativity almost all the time for a long time. The only way to help this disorder according to me lecture is to ACCEPT you are depressed, and learn to RECOGNIZE when you have negative thoughts and feelings and understand it is normal for you. Try not to concentrate on negativity and be more social also helps.\n\nIf you truly are depressed I recommend long term therapy combined with medical help and step by step lifestyle changes. Be careful when accepting drugs because it takes on average 15-20 minutes for a doctor to diagnose and prescribe drugs for depression. This is a dangerous statistic because too many people who do not need anti depressants are being prescribed them, this is harmful for the brain and body. In saying that is you are unbearably depressed/anxious, and have been for a long time, please tell your doctor and listen to them.\n\nThis is a talk on bi-polar manic-depression, which is different from just depression but its very good and most is still relevant ans interesting, by Stephen Fry https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2Ta0yFoNG8\n",

I went to the doctor and she immediately told me it was just anxiety and that I was having \"mini panic attacks\".\n\n\nThis blew my mind. I seriously thought I had SOMETHING. I felt physically sick for so long. But right after my appointment, my fever left and I feel 100 percent.\n\n\nI just want to spread the news. This caused me so much pain and worry. To all of my fellow anxiety sufferers, don't self diagnose, don't look things up on the internet.. it just makes it worse\n\n\n**TL;DR: Anxiety can cause some serious mental AND physical symptoms. and it can create seemingly real problems out of nothing.

I corrected it, but already it was really bad and really awkward. The sort of thing that I dwell on and dwell on knowing that it really isn't nearly as big a deal as I think it is, but that I can't help it regardless. I wanted to retain the information, but just kept wondering why I so stupidly used the wrong term. \n\nThen I remembered [this](http://www.get.gg/docs/ThoughtRecordSheet.pdf). Someone on Reddit gave it to me a while ago and I never really got the chance to try to use it. Besides, I was worried it would be in vain. Still, I carried a copy with me in case I wanted to and decided to today. \n\nThinking it through enough that I had to write down every detail and every way I could've done things differently really helped.

            "selftext": "She asked me a week ago if I might be able to watch her toddler for a 1/2 hour while she (toddler)was sleeping.  Today, her boyfriend said he made arrangements and I wasn't needed.  He calls back hours later and asks me to come over in ten minutes, he decided to leave early for work.  \n\nThat 30 minutes turned into an hour and a half.  I wasn't prepared for the toddler waking up.  I called her at the time she was supposed to be off of work, to see how long it would be.  There was a story of needing to do a few more things.  I said ok, I'm a little anxious but I'm okay.  When she was done, she send a text, \"leaving now\".  I called her back to see how long.  She was already in a rage.  \"If you can't hold it together then  call the cops to come watch my kid!\"  WTF?  If you also have anxiety you know, that can make the panic much worse.\n\nShe shows up, screeching her tires in the parking lot.  I opened the door (I was in her apartment) and she grabbed the toddler quite hastily and her dog ran out.  She said not a word to me and proceeded to drag the dog across the pavement and throw him in the car and sped off.  I was in shock.  She knows my condition well and this is how she chose to react.\n\nHere's how I feel:  I'm responsible for your child right now, why would you want to make me more anxious or send me into panic?  Just a simple \"Ok, just calm down, I'll be home in just a few minutes\" would have made the situation much easier.  There were other neighbors outside and they were stunned at her actions.  I explained the situation to one of the onlooking neighbors and she was sympathetic.  I'm thankful because she helped calm me down.\n\nI just really needed to vent.  My boyfriend says she will probably call and apologize.  I doubt it and besides, I wouldn't accept the apology.  I was having a panic attack, a legitimate medical emergency.  Had it been a heart attack or an epileptic episode, would she have behaved the same way?  That's not a real friend.  Please be kind in your replies.  It has been a really rough day.",

Also viewed many articles by googling 'Low Testosterone Symptoms'.\n\nI am on a trip, first trip in 2 years because of anxiety, and I suddenly remembered he lived where I was going. I looked him up, I went out for drinks, and asked him about anxiety that I have been working so hard to beat all by myself, and he had me come in and do a number of blood tests, I came back from visiting him again at his office just today, and found out that I a completely healthy, however my jewels weren't givin me the fuels. I ended up taking a shot in the arse, and back in a week. \n\nHe said, and I have read, that its the difference of cleaning your sunglasses. All of a sudden you get more focused, clear, and the rest of your body will function properly.\n\nSounds great to me, but I never would have thought to check that, even after seeing a normal MD, they just wanted to give me drugs. I guess within 2 weeks my levels should be right, and I hope to report back the effectiveness. \n\nTL;DR Dudes should get your testosterone in check, especially if you have anxiety. Google it. ",
