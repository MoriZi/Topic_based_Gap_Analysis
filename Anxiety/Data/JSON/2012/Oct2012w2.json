I know that the things I have to do aren't even that hard but the way my body reacts is totally different from what I actually consciously know. I know that if I put small efforts in over the week I can get all my chores and homework done. I know I can easily pass, I have never failed a subject, I never get low scores. I know that I am a high achiever but for some reason whenever faced with a bunch of work my body goes berserk. randomly when I think about passing or my future mark my breathing gets heavy, my chest feels tighter, I can feel blood rushing sensation. It feels like I am going to be attacked. I walk around stressed not able to do anything because the thought of doing something is too stressful. Sometimes my brain goes wild and I send a bunch of messages to my boyfriend. Then I feel stupid for acting all anxious. Then I hate the way I am because I feel my anxiety is a product of child abuse. I am being medicated so my anxiety is not as full blown as it used to be. regardless I still feel awful and stupid for having these sensations that are just plain unnecessary and illogical. My dream is to live away from anxious feelings, to just be able to handle pressure without breaking down. I'm scared it will affect me forever.\n\nSo does anyone feel like their anxiety is like a separate part away from their rational mind? Or do you believe your anxiety and feelings are true?\n\n**update** - thanks all for your comments. yes i know from studying psychology that the best thing to do is accept the way you are. it is hard when you feel a victim to it. it frustrates me so much that i understand and know all about this disorder but i cant control it. i have accepted that i study psychology but i am not immune to it.

I pushed through my anxiety and started inviting people to hang out. I only have a handful of casual-but-friendly acquaintances and friends-of-friends in this area, but friendships have to start somewhere, right?\n\n\nDespite my anxiety, shyness, and substantial hatred of rejection (seriously... I stopped dating 9 years ago and haven't made a new friend since my junior year of college), I managed to send out a facebook message inviting people to come see a movie with me. I got several polite turn-downs (working late, already have plans, promised to visit grandma, etc) and a few no replies. Many of the polite turn-downs included a \"thanks for thinking of me, and let me know the next time you do something like this.\"  Not bad at all, right?\n\nThe next week, I tried again with dinner. Same result, only with more ignores and only one \"ask me again next time!\"s.  I gave it a few weeks and tried it again with coffee. Ditto. Failure.\n\nA few weeks after *that*, I picked an activity that I thought would appeal to four of the people who'd responded before, and I only invited the four of them to join me. I got four polite no's.\n\n\nI have received 0 invitations back. Nobody is into hanging out with me.\n\n\nI can't do this again. I am totally deflated. I have no idea why I even bothered to TRY to make friends. Everyone left me before, and these new people would also eventually leave me, and this whole thing is a waste of time and a guaranteed way to feel left out and alone. People get married and move far away. People have kids and want to raise them somewhere with more museums or closer to their in-laws. I am here, alone, and I was doing a wonderful job of accepting that. \n\n\nI just really hate myself right now. I was okay, I was stable, I was happy, and then I had to go and mess everything up. Now instead of feeling comfortable with my solitary life, I feel rejected and inferior and alone. \n\n\nI don't drink often, but I think I need a glass of wine tonight.\n\n\nThanks for listening, reddit.",

He is wonderful and does his best to be supportive and understanding, but my problems get to him and I don't know how to make it better. I feel like I am slowly destroying our relationship :(\n\nLast night I had a dream that he finally got fed up enough and left me. I haven't been able to shake my feelings of depression and hopelessness since waking up.\n\nI work from home doing telemarketing calls. I realize how lucky I should feel to be able to work from home because it reduces my anxiety about leaving the house and having panic attacks, but I still can often not muster the energy to even feel grateful about it. I need this job desperately to pay bills and rent, but I often have panic attacks before and during my shifts which leave me exhausted and fed up.\n\nI just wish I could see and end to the pain in sight and look forward to something better. I feel like I have nothing good going for me and it is sometimes hard to see what the point is.\n\nI don't feel suicidal, I just don't feel like anything is worth it sometimes...\n\nIf you read through this, thanks for listening.\n",

I remember years ago in school I had to write a poem and described them as 'bugs, not butterflies.' It probably doesn't make sense but it's because they feel awful, not exciting or anything.\n\nI get them when I'm in class, when I'm at work, when I'm sitting at home watching TV. It's when I start thinking about something that bothers me or worries me. I cannot think about anything else afterwards. It's all I think about, my thoughts are clouded and focus only on one thing. I become paranoid and suddenly all my suspicions make sense. I can't focus on schoolwork and I can't even bring myself to do things for leisure, like reading a book or listening to music. Sometimes it gets to the point where I'm really easily irritated by anything/anyone. I try not to snap at people though, obviously.\n\nIs this anxiety? Because it's a terrible fucking feeling that I have to deal with here and it won't go away. Especially for the past 2 weeks. My boyfriend lied to me about something and although we made up and talked about it and he's been pretty great about it, whenever something triggers that memory, those feelings set in. Then I start feeling like shit until the next time I talk to him and I'm reassured.\n\nIs this what anxiety is? Am I going to need medication for this? The thought of having to take pills terrifies me.\n\n",

            "selftext": "This is going to be a wall of text. You've been warned.\n\nMy friend, let's call him Stephen, was diagnosed with general anxiety disorder and major depressive disorder last year, when we were sophomores in high school. It was because of my same diagnosis that summer that he got the courage to go. He's now sixteen. He was slowly learning to cope with the anxiety and depression, but like most, he had some off days. He always managed to get on with his day though.\n\nFast forward to this summer. Stephen's father died suddenly of a heart attack. His mother hadn't been living with them for years and he'd built up a lot of resentment towards her. She moved back in to take care of Stephen and his little sister. Stephen's mother stopped drinking and whatever else it was she was doing to take care of her children. She also has some mental health issues, but takes medication. The anger Stephen felt towards her lessened. Stephen also got his first serious girlfriend.\n\nEverything was going okay for a while until about a month and a half into school. I think everything just hit him like a ton of bricks. He started having panic attacks on a daily basis, and wouldn't come to school because of them, especially on days when he had a particularly difficult class. His anxiety causes him to feel physical pain in his chest and sometime completely shuts his body down to the point where he can't walk. His therapist also wanted to put him in the psychiatric ward at the hospital. Stephen refused to go and his mother refused to let him, as she knows what that area is like.\n\nStephen used to tell me that he would never actually kill himself. Especially not now, when he wants to go to heaven to see his father again. Saturday night though, he called me, crying. His mother has relapsed and stopped taking her medication (I don't know how long or if she's started again since then). He said he couldn't even get her to pay the phone bill. He told me he wished he was dead. I sat on the phone with him and talked him down until he told me he was going to be okay for the night. We texted later that night and the next day. So far, he's said nothing else that dark. He's worried about school and his family and his girlfriend. I'm scared to death of what will happen if his girlfriend decides to break up with him.\n\nI know what panic attacks are like and I know how it is to be worried every second of every day. However, I don't know what it's like to have my parent die, then have to live with some lady who caused a lot of my pent up rage. He's barely coming to school now. I need to know how to help him. No matter what I say, it doesn't seem to help when the morning comes and he has to get ready for school. I know he's in a lot of pain, but I don't want him to give up. I think some of our other friends might be giving up on him, but I refuse. \n\nSorry this is so long, but I wanted to explain the situation. Any advice would be greatly appreciated.",

            "selftext": "I'm queueing to get assessed for AD(H)D but in the meantime I've decided to see a psychologist about what I think is depression and anxiety (which makes life extremely hard for me). So today I saw a psychologist \"for real\" for the first time in my life. Talked to her for about 1 hour and 20 minutes. During the session she asked me questions and I did two screening tests (or whatever it's called). One for depression/anxiety and one for ADHD. The result on the ADHD-test wasn't conclusive or anything but apparently the other test shows I'm very \"low\" and anxious. The psychologist will probably refer me to someone who specialises in mood disorders and anxiety disorders. \n\nAnyway, one thing the psychologist told me today was that she thinks I might have OCD. I'm not sure why she thinks so. I told her that people at university have commented on my need to straighten things out and have things in certain angles etc. She then asked me questions and I told her I always count steps when I walk up and down stairs, that I like to feel \"even\" (so if I for example get water on one hand I need to get water on the other hand as well to even things out, otherwise it feels uncomfortable) and things like that. But I don't think I have any obsessive thoughts. Or well, I have a lot of obsessive thoughts but no \"classic\" OCD thoughts (we didn't even talk about obsessive thoughts by the way). The psychologist said that people with OCD do these sort of routines/rituals to manage their anxiety and since I have a lot of anxiety and some rituals/compulsions that might be what I'm doing. She obviously didn't diagnose me or anything (a specialist will do that) so of course it's not sure I've got OCD but don't all people do these kinds of rituals (I do other things beside the ones I've mentioned by the way)? Is it really \"abnormal\"? I don't really get it.",
