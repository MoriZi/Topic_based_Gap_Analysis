When I was in elementary school and we weren't supposed to talk and an adult said \"I heard someone talking! Who was it? Admit it or the whole class doesn't get recess!\" I would get terrified. Of course, the kid who was actually breaking the rules would never give himself up. There were a few times where I lied and gave myself up because I couldn't take sitting in class for those several tense minutes while the teacher waited to see if the real perpetrator would come forward. It was easier just to end it than to wait and be afraid that someone was secretly mad at me for something I didn't do. (I'm pretty sure the teachers knew because they would always give me a weird look since I never talked even when it was allowed, but they couldn't just let me \"get away with it\" since I had just \"turned myself in\")\n\nI don't falsely admit to wrongdoing anymore, but I still hate the \"Someone is screwing up and *it might be you*!\"",

I had horrible nausea lack of appetite and loss of sleep. It may be a strange thing but I don't want to take any type of medication because frankly I wouldn't even remember to take it daily. \nAnyway, is there anyone out there who is doing the same thing? If so are there any helpful tips that's gotten you through a tough anxiety attack?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdit: \n\nI spoke with my doctor about dealing with anxiety with out medication. He said it was a brave choice that he didn't recommend considering I had a history of depression. (I didn't even know I did!!) I am now in therapy and apparently have a problem with anger management. (guess I'm all messed up now...) I still have not taken any medication as I am stubborn. About 80% of the time I'm alright. Through therapy I've been able to gather that I get the majority of my attacks when I am 'in trouble' (like my boss says \"I need to see you\" And it doesn't even need to be bad. It's just that sentence that freaks me out) and when I'm timed on a run. And all of my anger issues point toward the stupidity I have to deal with at work. As far as my depression, I guess it's caused by an incident where I was sexually assaulted 4 years ago. I haven't thought much of it since then but I guess it's suppressed emotions there. \nLuckily my better half has been a great 'help' (he says he does nothing but him being there during a break down is more than enough) I also read how everyone on this subreddit is so supportive and it puts me in a calmer mood. (and lowers my heart rate)\nThis is a long journey that I am just now getting to know and I want to thank all of you who commented (and those who will in the future maybe?) for your great and wonderful ideas that I will definitely take into account while I'm going through this. Thanks and keep your chin up and so will I! &lt;3",

            "selftext": "copy pasta from my other thread, im too upset right now\n-------\n\nI wanted to post this in /r/getmotiviated but I didn't think I'd get any comments. I just want a few replies.\n\n**Edit: took a few things out to make personal details less specific**\n\nI'm a 20 year old female and I'm scared of everything. I don't think I ever used to be like this - I took part in school sports day until I permanently damaged my ankle and was banned from entering, I used to pick up caterpillars,  butterflies, spiders, and all sorts without caring, I climbed through hedges and fences to find new things and new places without any fear, I did performances at drama club, I let everyone know my opinion and I wasn't offended if they disagreed, and I was a massive tomboy who spent a lot of time on the internet but had a healthy mix of hanging about outside too.\n\n\nThen I started high school, a same-sex high school, and I completely withdrew into msyelf. I did not get on well with the other girls. Went into a massive \"emo\" phase as you do when you're 15 and the world is against you. Not like that any more obviously but years later and now:\n\n* I can't get on a plane (this is a serious phobia affecting my life - to \"tackle it\" I took a short 50min each way round trip to London that was booked for me without my knowledge, preparing with 5 x 2mg diazepam tablets over the course of 12 hours and it did nothing to me, I took more to see why they weren't working, I thought I was genuinely going to die the entire flight and I cannot relive that experience without being sedated ever again, 50 minutes of thinking you are in absolute peril is hell)\n\n\n* I'm too frightened to drive my car in case I come across a hill (I will literally have a panic attack if I stall, so I just don't drive - it's not just for my safety but for other road users'). It took me different instructors (the first one was a pervert, the second one told me to give up, and I later found out the third guy occasionally helped teach \"challenged\" people to drive, it took that much :|) and 50+ lessons to finally take my test and I passed first time, but it doesn't help my parents won't even let me practice. They are much more anxious than I am and I think I've wound up with some genetic anxiety predisposition.\n\n\n* I find sleeping alone very difficult and I cannot sleep in a house by myself. I moved out with two housemates who did not stay frequently at all and I could not stay on my own.\n\n\n* I always need to have someone by my side when I take a new medication in case I go into some sort of anaphylactic shock.\n\n\n* I can't do cardio at the gym because my heart beating too quickly scares me and I've read too much about SADS recently\n\n\n* I hate trains and buses because I don't know who the driver is and they don't have toilets and I can't get off them when I want. A few months ago I decided to take a train journey for the first time in five years and it was hijacked by a man with a gun. I want to go on a rail-journey with my boyfriend soon but this is scary.\n\n\n* I just read a comment about a bone I didn't even know existed being susceptible to horrible spinal injuries - that made me have a panic attack and I'm still in tears over it.\n\n\n\n* I didn't take birth control for years when I was seriously recommended it for severe menstrual cramps and anaemia, because I'd read somewhere it gives you blood clots, which made my school attendance drop to 70-80%.\n\n\n* I currently have a lower-back injury which I need an MRI scan for but I'm refusing because I'm too scared. I also had recurring tonsillitis for 3 years because I refused to have the operation to get them removed, because I'm too scared.\n\n\n* Only in the past few months, for the first time in my life ever, have I been able to swallow non-soluble painkillers/anti-biotics with the help of my boyfriend who has convinced me I'm not going to choke.\n\n\nI'm probably a massive hypochondriac but I think it's a fear of dying more than anything. On the flip side, I'm too scared to even blog any more in case someone doesn't like what I've written and makes fun of me, so it's not all health related.\n\n\nDespite all this I have more friends than I've ever had in my whole life (since starting university) who think these are just funny typical quirks of mine (\"haha, never getting on a train with you again, that was hilarious\") and don't realise just how shit I feel about being so pathetic, I've near-perfect grades (won scholarships and came top in the class etc.), and I've met the actual love of my life (poor boy) so, what's there to be worried about? Exactly, I don't fucking know! And here's me freaking out over getting a fucking bus, getting steadily steadily worse. He'd probably be quite sad if he saw me talking about myself like this.\n\n\nWhat the fuck is wrong with me? How do I stop my fears from ruining my own life? I miss being 13 and not giving a fuck. It's like puberty and school kicked in and destroyed my adventurous spirit. I've had cognitive behavioural therapy for the flying thing, which the therapist ended early because he thought I was alright, when really I felt like I'd \"caught on\" to what the therapy was trying to do and it didn't work. \n\n\nI've never officially been diagnosed with anything but I'm sure it would be some sort of OCD (I have fucking stupid rituals) with a delicious anxiety disorder mixed in. I honestly don't want to be like this - I just can't help it. I feel like my brain is too logical and I'm \"above not caring about things going wrong\", it analyses statistics too much and has become obsessed with avoiding risk. FML.\n\n\nMy aim is to be able to say fuck it, seize the day, and be NORMAL. And don't bullshit me with the whole \"aw people are different, no-one is truly normal\" You know what I mean. I want to stop being like this.\n\n\n**tldr; i'm too scared to do a lot of normal activities if there's even a minute risk of something going wrong involved. I feel like my brain is too logical and I'm \"above not caring about things going wrong\", it analyses statistics too much and has become obsessed with avoiding risk. FML. have lovely boyfriend and don't want to scare him off as he's the only thing keeping me sane.**",

            "selftext": "So, on Saturday, my now ex-boyfriend, I guess, decided to break up with me. I completely understand why he did and I guess, in a sense, I am thankful because I am able to work on myself because when I was with him I never would. I would attempt but I would never follow through. This was a definite eye-opener for me. I was going through jealousy issues in terms of a social aspect. When he'd go out, I'd end up mad with myself and take it out on him. I was and am going though clinginess because I do not make friends easily with my anxiety. Also, my negativity was a big factor as well.\n\nIt's only been a little over 24 hours since we've broken up and I just weighed myself - lost 5 pounds. I haven't eaten anything since 8pm last night and even that was just a small portion. Before that, I hadn't eaten since 11pm the previous day. I never knew it was possible, but it happened. I am so disorientated. I put a pillow outside from the couch and I have no idea why. My dad asked me when he found it. I couldn't give an answer. I have constant butterflies in my stomach, which I read is my body is doing its flight or fight response and the adrenaline is constantly running through me. I feel sick and nauseated constantly and feel like I want to throw up. I can't sleep. I occasionally have chest pains every now and then. I just can't believe what the hell I am going through because of this situation.\n\nI am so stuck. I am afraid of being alone. Everyone is far away from me and I only have one true friend in the city where I live. I also have school so I can't take time off to visit people. Obviously, I want to work on myself - work out, gain a social life, get a better appearance and be comfortable with myself. The longest I have been single was before I had first gone out with this guy was 7 months. But, ultimately, I will focus on bettering myself, doing things for myself because I have always put others before me and during this time period of being single I will make sure that nothing will get in the way of my happiness. I feel like I've lost my identity since he's been gone. I've never truly knew who I was. I don't know what it is that I want.\n\nI am hoping that once I better myself and deal with these issues that he will see how far I have come for myself and will want to potentially try again. I want to make it clear that I am not doing all of these things for the potential of getting back together, I am doing it for myself and myself alone. I believe that once I get through this, if he still feels the same for me, that we can definitely make this work. I still love this man to death and I always will. He still loves and cares for me and I have this feeling deep down inside that he will change his mind once he sees this. This is just a test and I need to win and prove that I am a strong woman who is capable of doing anything she puts her mind to. I just need some guidance, people to talk to and things to distract me for the time being. Any ideas on how to start living my life for me?\n ",

All in all I feel some responsibility, but it was definitely not mostly my fault. However I often feel really guilty, even over the situations where I intellectually know I did no wrong but was made to feel that I had been a bad friend.\n\nMy life is fine now, it's actually really good, but the thoughts of those ex-friends kind of haunt me. I don't know why it's taking up *so* much space in my mind. I think about it every day, I instinctively imagine how those ex-friends would judge me for different things I do during the day (especially if it's something I'm enjoying, I will suddenly think \"oh, he or she would think I was a loser if they saw me now). I worry I will run into them on the bus or at a party. Sometimes I feel like they have this.. secret club and that everybody else would \"side\" with them against me and that's ridiculous and I feel sort of egocentric to even think like that (other people rarely think as much about you as you think they do, right). I just feel like this is holding me back.\n\nI'm guessing this is some sort of anxiety (I have been plagued by anxiety before but I've overcome a lot of it) and that my mind uses these screwed up relationships as a sort of tangible \"object\" to put my vague anxieties and fears into. \n\nHas anybody else dealt with anxiety and bad feelings tied to old relationships, be it friendships or partners?

            "selftext": "Alright, so I've reached a very stressful and scary time in my life and I'm not sure where else to turn to right now. \n\nI've had anxiety issues since I was about in the 2nd grade, but basically have dismissed them my whole life because I had believed them to be normal. My anxiety had built itself up so badly that around high school I started having suicidal thoughts as a result of how trapped I had been feeling. The first two years of college these thoughts began increasing more and more and my anxiety has been controlling every move, and I believed it to be completely normal. I have a really great life, with a supportive family and great boyfriend and I get good grades and I participate in lots of activities I love, so I really thought my feelings were normal, because in reality, there's no reason for me to feel the way I do.\n\nThen, this summer, I kinda hit rock bottom. I was supposed to spend 3 weeks working at a summer camp that I LOVE. I had been a camper at this camp starting in the 5th grade and went up through their programs until my Junior year of high school, where I went on a month long backpacking trip in the Rockies. This camp has done SO much for me. I worked there last summer, leading canoe trips for little kids and I loved it too. But this summer, I just couldn't handle it. I was filled with dread about every situation and the few weeks upcoming my leaving for camp, I was crying every day, not sleeping, etc. The few days before I left, I started having regular breakdowns and panic attacks, and finally confessed to my parents the suicidal thoughts I was feeling. However, they pushed me to go. The first few days there were absolute hell, and I made it through 2 days of training with suicide running through my mind at all times and panic attacks keeping me up at night. My parents and I and my bosses decided that this was not a good place for me to learn coping mechanisms, so I went home. This was two days ago.\n\nNow, I'm home and yesterday I went to go see a therapist who diagnosed me with severe anxiety and depression. While talking to her, a bunch of issues kind of came to light and I realized it's not normal to feel the way I feel. It's not normal to feel trapped in life and it's not normal to let anxiety fill me with dread about things like hanging out with my friends.\nHowever, the therapist has recommended me to another doctor who she wants to prescribe me an SSRI. I am really wary about going on meds, because I'm a nursing student so I've basically seen/learned about every terrible thing that can go wrong while taking every kind of antidepressant. I also don't want to become dependent, don't want to change any part of myself, and feel as if it's an easy way out. But I do recognize that there's some serious chemical issues going on inside me, and that's the way to fix it.\n\nThe problem is that I've got about 2 weeks until I can meet with this doctor, so I'm just waiting around for 2 weeks filled with shame and guilt for leaving my camp job. I'm so embarrassed that I wasn't strong enough to work at a place I love and a place I even worked last year. I feel like I've failed myself and I feel wrong trying to make myself happy when I'm hiding at home when I gave up my responsibilities at camp. \n\nSorry for this being long and rambling. I just needed to get that out because I don't really know where else to go.\n\nMy first question is if anyone is on/has taken an SSRI, I would really like to hear their experiences with it. I'm really afraid to take them, also afraid of the side effects. I don't want to gain weight or kill my sex drive, and I don't want the anticolinergic effects of the drug to make me more anxious. \n\nAlso, I just want some perspective and advice. I completely hit my worst point the other day with having to leave camp and my anxiety basically snowballed to the point where I couldn't take it anymore. I don't really know where to go from here and how to get back in my normal life. I'm scared to see my friends and scared to leave my house because I don't want anyone to think less of me. I know I need to get past this otherwise I'll just keep spiraling downwards. Today I'm going to go to a bookstore and find some books to help through this, but if there's any real life tips, I'd love to know.\n\nSorry for how long this was :/\n\n\n ",

She just knew. I called you when I needed a friend to listen, to hear me out. I never called anyone else when my parents fought or when my dad was drunk. I called you because I felt safer talking to you. I thought you were my best friend.\n\nYou weren't. You went to someone and told them I was being an annoying whining bitch to call you whenever I was upset. You said you had your own problems and hearing mine was just frustrating to you because I could have just dealt with it.\n\nWhat's worse is that I had high expectations of you than others. You saw how bad my knees were and when I needed surgery you listened to someone else who said I was lying rather than believe me. Why would I lie to you about that? Then you go and join in with the others and ignore me and leave me out of plans. Suddenly all those amusement park trips and days talking about video games and anime were nothing but a lie.\n\nThen I see you years later and you have the nerve to ask me why I didn't try harder? Try harder for what??\n\nTo be your friend? To do what, exactly? Talking to you had to be like walking on eggshells because if I mentioned something making me upset it would be 'whining'. \n\nI don't need you to be my 'friend'. I don't need pity because after I left that hell of a high school I made real friends. And you know what? They call ME to make sure I'm alright.\n\nThey know my father well enough that on the 4th of July they called to ask if I was handling it alright.\n\nThey held my hand when I needed it most and they were there for me and support me. So, no, I don't need to try harder for someone that never wanted to try for me. It's not a one way street, I did for you and you never tried to do for me. Not once. You always chose others over helping me.\n\nWhere were you when everyone laughed at me because I was fat?\n\nWhere were you when someone posted that photo of me on facebook to comment insults on it? You stayed friends with that person and said it was 'just a joke'.\n\nWhere were you when I went missing in school that day and someone found me crying in a corner? \n\nYou weren't there at all and I am doing better without you. I am taking my medicine and you know what? I may have bad days but I also have good days and good people behind me. \n\nI don't wish any harm on you, I hope you have a good life. But I don't want to be friends with someone like you. You aren't someone I need in my life. \n\nKeep talking to those people who lied to you back then about me. \n\nI hope when you need someone to talk to that they listen to you properly and don't tell you to 'deal with it'. Because no one deserves that. \n\nAnd just so you know, even though you ignored me and treated me horribly, when you ran for class president I voted for you. You didn't win but I voted for you.",

            "selftext": "I feel like my social anxiety is my only vice right now, my only weakness. Fuck it is a powerful one though and I hate it! I'm out tonight, with friends, and I just couldn't.. do.. anything. \n\nI was just stuck, they're buying me drinks, pretty girls asking me to dance and trying hard to get me moving but I just stand there with my arms folded feeling like shit. I just can't fucking move and I hate being pitied. I just gave up and said fuck it I want to go home I'm no good at this, I can't do it, I'm letting people down, I'm bringing people down, people don't want to be around me, I'm not fun, I'm not engaging.\n\nThe entire night girls are checking me out but even when drunk I can't make eye contact with them. They say girls like confidence. Confidence isn't my problem, I have a psychological disorder that is paralysing me. I enjoy a challenge and invite it in many circumstances, but this is the one area where I just shrivel up and want to disappear.\n\nI feel sick and overwhelmed when people pay attention to me, I just feel like I'm on a different level. They're normal people who can socialize, and I'm just way the fuck down here; they're expecting me to dance when I can barely stand without feeling uncomfortable.\n\nIn many ways I want to be dead. It just feels like such a big hurdle, especially seeing as every time I go out I come home being even more neurotic because nothing goes my way. I will be this way forever and I don't want to live like that. My last chance is to become a black belt in Aikido; they say once I achieve that then everything else will follow. If it doesn't I wont have a choice anymore.\n\nThis is very much an offmychest post because I just need to get it out there.\n\n**TLDR** I can't socialize for shit and I don't feel like it will ever get better and I will die alone and miserable because fuck my brain.",

            "selftext": "Do note: I'm very cynical and could probably be classified as self loathing and more likely then not self pitying.\n\nI've got a bit of social anxiety. It's to the point that I spend countless hours alone at home on the computer or Xbox doing legitimately nothing. I sit here day after day doing absolutely nothing.\n\nDon't misunderstand me; I do have friends. I sit with them before school and eat lunch with them every day (I'm going into my junior year and will be turning 17 quite soon for some context.) The issue with me is that I'm extremely awkward most of the time. It's as if my brain forgets how to speak properly and my jokes are either creepy or simply pathetic. I'm like this in the vast majority of situations. My voice will get really small and I don't participate in conversations. I just become the awkward guy sitting there that isn't talking.\n\nI fucking loathe that feeling.\n\nBecause of this, I pretty much decline every social offer. I make excuses and such in order to not have to be that fucking weird fat kid sitting there that doens't speak to anyone. This has pretty much lead to a boring and dull life in which the person I consider to be my best friend would be considered an aquaintance by the majority of people.\n\nAnother thing I've got in my head about whether or not to do something is my mother and whether or not she will let me do something or how embarassing is she going to be. How many times will she call me to make sure I'm OK? Is she going to let the 16 year old me stay out later than 8PM? Is she going to call the parents of the friends house I'm aksed if I could go  to before I'm allowed to go to make sure they're A there and B not going to leave at all during the time I'm there? I'm fucking 16 years old and am not even allowed to walk outside at night because my mom's so fucking scared something will happen. A few weeks ago I was going to try and get my ass in shape (I'm a bit overweight (which has led to some obvious self esteem issues)) and went for a walk at around 9pm (South Florida here, any time before that's like being in a sauna outside.) She panicked quite a bit (she does have panic disorder that's gone untreated because who the fuck knows why) and was staring intently out the windows to make sure I walked by the house every few minutes (I live in a circular neighborhood) or she'd freak out. Missing a call while out at a friends house back in 8th grade got me grounded for a month along with a three hour long screaming match with her about my horrible irresponsibility. Overall, my mom's a psychotic bitch with a mental disorder she hasn't gotten treated. To add to that, she's in nursing school so she won't let me do things because \"I don't have the time for the stress that it would cause right now.\" (eg: I was going to finally do something social and take a friend up on an offer to go to the beach (2 miles away, tops) and my mother refused to let me go because she \"had to study and me being out would cause stress and be a distraction\" so fuck her for that.) I forgot to mention my dad's dead and she never met anyone else (not even a boyfriend) in the 15 years since so there's nobody to balance her crazy out. \n\nI've since gotten a job at a local PC repair shop in which I work solely on the machines. I don't have any interactions with the customers through either phone or face to face in the shop, thankfully. This is more or less simply because I can't talk to people I don't know too well. I have to know and trust you in order to be able to openly speak with you, otherwise I shrivel up into a ball of anxiety that manifests through awkwardness, embarassment and a will to never do it again.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nMeh. Sorry for the rant. I don't even know where that went or was going. I would've written more but I've got work in 5 hours and need some sleep..\n\n\ntl;dr fuck me",

It's about a 45' drive from home up narrow, steep, winding, dirt roads.  I did a test drive last week. It was awful.

He had to drive us back because I couldn't.  Tomorrow is the big day; I have a work presentation in this rural town and my boss has put me in charge.  I'm in charge of set up and clean up. Nevermind how frustrated I am with myself for letting my anxiety rule my life.  I just need something to get me through tomorrow.
