            "selftext": "Heya Reddit, I sent this to some friends and they suggested that I post this here.  I hope it helps!\n\nA few years ago I started having some problems with anxiety.  Things have improved slowly but steadily until now, at which point I would probably rate my anxiety as \"low\" rather than where it started as \"crushing\".\n\nHere's something which has helped in my recovery.\n\nI have found that it's useful to distinguish physical sensation from my emotional state.  The best example I've come up with is the feeling you get when you drink coffee.\n\nOriginally when all of this started, I quit drinking coffee, because whenever I drank coffee I would feel anxious.  I've realized over time that it wasn't really the coffee which was causing me to become anxious.  Caffeine creates the physical sensation in my body of a slightly tightened chest, a fluttering in my stomach, enhanced mental acuity, and a slightly modified mental perception of what's going on.\n\nThese physical sensations are very similar to those I feel when I am in an anxious state of mind, and so originally whenever I felt these sensations my mind would interpret them as feelings which required an anxiety response and would lead to an anxious state of mind, which would sometimes lead to panic attacks.  Now, when I drink coffee and feel these things I simply make myself mindful that these physical sensations DO NOT require an emotional response.  They're simply caused by the effect of a drug on my body, and the drugs effect of increased synaptic activity in my thinkputty.\n\nImmediately, my anxiety response disappears and I can enjoy the caffeine buzz as I used to before all of this business started.\n\nEvery cup of coffee is a therapy session, and it has helped me make my way back to some level of normalcy.  \n\nI started with a quarter cup of coffee per day and slowly worked my way up.  Now I drink about a cup a day, which is generally all I want anyway.\n\nSometimes, I'll drink a shitload of coffee.  I view it as a personal challenge.  Come on caffeine, you dirty sonofabitch.  Let's see what you got!\n\nI've had four cups this morning and I'm about to vibrate into another dimension, but no anxiety thus far.",

I haven't gotten a text or call from my girlfriend since 9:30 this morning (it's currently 4PM). This is extremely odd considering we're always texting eachother and communicating. She knows I have issues with anxiety. But ironically, she is the biggest trigger if I don't know she's okay. She had a final today at 10:30, and that's all she had to do. We couldn't afford the parking permit, so she's been walking in the mornings, which isn't far, but we're in Kansas City, and I'm always worrying about the worst that could happen to her. I love her so much, which is why I worry about her. I don't know what to do. I know I'm going to go home and there will be a reasonable explanation for this, but that thought doesn't help a bit. This is just me venting. Sorry if this is pointless.\n\nUPDATE: She was fine. She never looked at her phone the whole day, then she took a long nap apparently. She apologized and everything, and so did I, knowing it's not her fault. We're very communicative. She understands that sometimes I need to get a hold of her or I'm gonna explode. \n\nThanks for all the positive support everybody.",

            "selftext": "It is a basic CBT teaching I believe. Anyway with this kind of logic, it can give one a different understanding on what anxiety is. I know anxiety can be very hard to control, like taming a tiger ;)\n\nAnyway... Anxiety normally starts with a certain thought. Once you accept that thought as truth, you start creating even more relevant thoughts around that thought. So, then our subconscious starts to feel the energy of our thoughts, sorta like when you watch a action movie and you get this whole rush. Sometimes you even feel like your in that movie. And I know with anxiety it can be really hard to focus into movies... so straight to my point.\n\nWhen I say think of smiling. Just think about nothing but smiling :D. Feel it, that smile. lol. You just created that emotion with your thoughts.\n\nWe are basically gods of our own thoughts, artist we are all. Eventually the anxiety gets so bad, we forget that we are the painters of our minds. So our minds begin to rule us and take over. We basically become tools of our minds. And because of the internet, our minds tend to develop the habbit of being rather active to the fast pacedness of it.\n\nI was having this really hard day today, feeling absolutely foggy and unhappy. I dont want to use the word depressed, because once I accept it as depression it grows.\n\nWhen I feel cruddy like this, a part of me say's \"Dont surf the net, simplify and try to control your thinking\". Well today I actually listened to that, so I sat, relaxed, Meditated sorta. Because it was hard to relax, I told my self (Smile, relax, tune out the world, and just be). I trusted that and stopped thinking other stuff, I just drifted off with a smile on my face.\n\nWhen I opened my eyes, the energy of my room felt much more amplified, and I felt good. So I am here now to tell about it. \n\n**TL;DR** Felt anxious/crappy, stopped what I was doing, consciously changed my thoughts to simple positive ones, and drifted off without thinking twice. I now feel much better :)",

            "selftext": "So I've done a lot of reading on Anxiety, I will share my story. It all happened one night, I was out with friends and we had a nice dinner at a restaurant. Later that night we had to take a bus ride about 45 minutes to 1 hour back to our destination. This bus was full of acquaintances and then just my one friend and I. (the two others stayed behind.) Anyhow as soon as the bus doors closed, I started to feel nauseous, like I had diarrhea coming on. I toughed it out but seriously considered jumping off the bus. Long story short I made it with some coaching from my friend. When I got back to my room I ran to the bathroom, but there was no diarrhea, actually nothing happened, I just felt relief. Since then, I have had anxiety for the last 10 or so years, with a break in the middle of about 4 years. \n\nHow does this affect me? Well it makes it tough for me to walk across the street (about 1/2 mile R/T) with work colleagues for lunch. I rarely ride in someone elses car, unless I feel absolutely comfortable with them, like I could ask them to pull over and I could poop by their car and they wouldnt judge me. Airplanes are terrible for me. The whole sitting while waiting to take off, and the sitting while it taxi's to the terminal. I go out of my way to look for non-stop flights, even international. Overall I just get really strong feelings of uneasyness. I can deal with the stomach feelings, you know not really craps, not really pain, just weird feeling. Its the thought of having diarrhea and crapping myself on a crowded plane, bus, coworkers car, where-ever. Strangely, I feel like if someone I know closely is aware of my phobia then it doesnt creep up, but I am reluctant to tell the world. This has made me reluctant to take better jobs in life, I will never eat like Denny's greasy food for breakfast, mcdonalds, or stuff that I am not familiar with, even if I want that. I need to change it ASAP!\n\nSo I once took zoloft (depressed at the time, then changed jobs and luckily snapped out of it), I didnt like it, I lost my sex drive for like 2 years. I stopped with that one and havent tried again. I have considered hypnosis, even though I believe it is some charlatan stuff. I have found some success with like this self-hypnosis thing on youtube. (if you want the link just ask) Is there some medication I can take that makes it just go away, and I keep my sex drive? My biggest concern is to kill the feeling of freaking out on a plane, because my next job (already lined up) is going to require some travel.  \n\nAnyone else have something similar? Please blow up my inbox, I need to know about others and what is helping them out. ",

            "selftext": "I am a [21M] junior in college and have been dealing with anxiety and mild OCD since I was about a sophomore in high school. I began by going to a therapist to talk about the issues I was having for about a 6 month period. After all was said and done I got diagnosed with mild OCD/GAD; having compulsive thoughts and letting little things bother me and not able to stop thinking about it in my head. Essentially, my thoughts get stuck in a constant loop and begin to overwhelm me. I got put on Citalopram (brand name is Celexa). I've been taking that everyday for a couple of years now. It has seemed to work relatively well. However, with school getting harder and harder (I am a BS Biochemistry and BS Chemistry major) I have noticed my anxiety getting worse at times. Just this year, I've gone into a test feeling very confident on the material and when I get the test I just blank and can't recall much of anything. This is the first time that has ever happened to me. So to my point; I've always smoked weed throughout high school and still do now. I didn't smoke very much 9th-12th grade because I played year round baseball and that basically consumed my life. But this year I've gotten into a routine for about the past 8 months of smoking every night. I never do during the day or when I have work I need to get done. It is simply my way of ending my day and helping me relax and not stress and not have compulsive thoughts of schoolwork or anything that may be causing me stress at the time. Is it possible that me \"self medicating\" is starting to have more of a negative effect and causing increased anxiety without me realizing. I feel like my anxiety is progressively getting worse but I am not sure if it is from chronic marijuana use or if my medicine isn't right for me or what. Has anyone else tried smoking marijuana to help cope with anxiety? \n\nSub note: I have never had an anxiety/panic attack or any bad experience whatsoever after smoking. I have had two mild panic attacks in my life but both times when completely sober and never near a time I had recently smoked. ",

I am getting checked for diabetes even though the Doc says chances are extremely low.  Not sure if I should at the very least see a neurologist or organise some form of CT scan.\n\nSomeone please tell me they have experienced similar symptoms during a single episode as I did today?  Going kind of nuts here.\n\nEdit:  Apologies I didn't reply sooner, on Australian time here and ended up going back to the hospital after another similar episode yesterday.  Was busy at the hospital so by the time I was in a bed all the above symptoms had gone (bar a headache and heavy chest), was monitored for 7 hours though and nothing was found.\n\nIn short.... starting to believe the doc! (pending some tests).\n\nThanks for all the responses, this is a great community.  Will try to answer a some of the questions now.\n",

            "selftext": "I am 17F, and in recent months I feel as if I've lost control of my anxiety.\nFor example, today my boyfriend came over and it was the first time I'd seen him in a while because I had been ill, and he said he'd missed me and I said I'd missed him and we really had a wonderful day, just our usual good time. However, as soon as he goes out the door I start worrying \"Oh god, I should have acted more excited to see him\" \"Why did I say x instead of saying y\" \"I hope I didn't hurt his feelings when I said z\" I end up getting upset and worrying until I see him again. \n\nI've *always* been an anxious person and I've been to several doctors and therapists, I've tried hypnotherapy as a last-resort, I've even tried changing my diet. There's a pretty extensive history of mental illness on my Father's side of the family, and he's suffering from things he can't admit to.\n\nI have a feeling that my birth control is behind my heightened anxiety, often when I would take my periods I would become a total wreck for a week and they'd be very painful so I decided to start taking Cerazette and it went just great up until the start of this year, when periods became very irregular. I would spot for anywhere up to 8 weeks. The only reason I stayed on them was because I thought \"well 6-8 weeks of light spotting with no pain whatsoever certainly beats 2 weeks of vomiting and bleeding through pads\" For some of the time I was spotting I would be overly sensitive, irrational, and emotional. But now it's ALL the time I'm spotting/bleeding and it's tiring me out. I do a good job of hiding it when I'm around people but occasionally I can't and I end up having a cry, luckily I have an understanding boyfriend and he's a very calm person. I'm on my last pack of tablets and as soon as those are finished I will no longer be taking them as I'm looking into other methods of birth control in the hopes that I'll get back to my \"normal\" still anxious, but less so, self.\n\n**TLDR; My birth control is turning me into an irrational person who can't cope with saying potentially the \"wrong\" thing and I've just had enough of it, I'm sick of not being able to \"relax\" and I'm sick of not being able to enjoy things.**",

            "selftext": "Yesterday I watched [this video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32K-rEIbBgE) about anxiety and panic attacks. Pretty much me to the 10th degree. I felt completely reassured by this that nothing is ACTUALLY wrong with me.. it's my thoughts doing this to me and I CAN talk myself out of it if I let myself. It will go away if I STOP WORRYING about things and if I don't let myself be overwhelmed if &amp; when the physical signs of anxiety/panic start. (aka fight or flight symptoms beginning.)    \n\nSo after watching that yesterday, I was completely fine managing my anxiousness even though I was exhausted and not feeling too great because I partied and stayed up too late the night before. I was doing fine until I went to Safeway. Stupid tiny things started really frustrating me..(ie. not feeling good, feeling tired, headache, having to walk super far, not being able to find the wine my friend asked me to get for her fast.. ect.).. then I got stupid dizzy tunnel vision because I let my frustration get to me. So tunnel vision then escalated to me worrying and not being able to catch a full breath. When I feel like I can't catch a full breath, it makes me try to correct that feeling so I'm continuously taking deep breaths trying to get that \"full refreshing breath\" feeling which only makes things worse and my throat becomes tight, chest becomes stiff as a rock and I start mildly hyperventilating. Mild hyperventilation makes my thoughts race harder and my worrying escalates to worrying that I'm going to faint in the store, have a heart attack or have some kind of crazy meltdown in front of ppl.\n\nI dizzily &amp; frantically walk to the check out line where I'm trying SOOO hard to play it off.. but in all actuality I'm breathing wayy too heavily, clearing my throat repeatedly and I'm digging through my purse trying to look for a chapstick to distract myself. People get in line behind me. Finally its the person in front of me's turn to pay. \n\nHe's counting his money and change and it's taking forever. My frustration SUPER getting to me.. my mind is racing and heart is beating incredibly hard. At this point I turn around and see that one of the girls behind me is staring at me. I immediately think \"she thinks I'm crazy, she notices me freaking out, she thinks I'm on drugs, she thinks I stole something... blah blah blah.\" I'm borderline losing it. \"Keep it together,\" I tel myself.\n\nThe guy ends up not having enough money to pay. He says.. okay I'll just put it back. I'm suuuper frustrated and at this point can barely see straight. I try to play it cool though and I ask \"how much are you short?\" shakily. \"70 cents,\" he responds. I pull out a dollar and hand it to him. He thanks me over and over and over and the check out lady said \"Aww thats so nice of you. Thanks for doing that!\" It doesn't make me feel better. \"Yeah, yeah, now fucking cash me the fuck out so I can get the fuck OUT OF HERE\" is what I'm thinking to myself.\n\nThe girl cashes me out. I remember thinking I was going to black out. I shake my head and blow air harshly though pursed lips..  like blowing a raspberry with no tounge (i don't know why but it helps me shake and wake my head/face up and makes me feel a little more in control). I walk out of the store. I sit in my car. I lock my door. Breeeeeeathe, just breeeeeeathe. I regain a little sense of normality. I drive to my friends house nervously. I get there. I'm shaken up, but I' start drinking some beers and hanging out with friends, completely disappears.\n\nToday, I was perfectly fine until I got frustrated once again. My computer and iphone started crapping out and both were taking FOREVER to load a song my dad wanted me to play on his new speakers, I also kept thinking I needed to hurry and go shower and get ready because theres a party I'm supposed to attend tonight, I had to go pee, my dog wanted me to take her outside, my mom cooked spaghetti and wanted me to eat some. The freaking speakers were blaring loud music and my ipod and computer were taking forever and so BOOM; I get dizzy, derealization sets in and the uncomfortable breathing starts. I go upstairs in my room. I put my phone on my bed. take off my pants. Go to look for my phone because I hear it vibrate. I can't find it anywhere. I feel myself becoming SUPER frustrated. I find my phone but can't shake the feelings completely.. which brings me here, typing this, right now. Breathing is better now. Vision and dizziness still suck.. but once I stop looking at the screen and hop in the shower, I'm hoping that will change.\n\nI hope you are all having a good day /r/anxiety folks. I feel for you and love you all. I hear my parents kissing each other in the room next to mine which means it's definitely time for me to leave the room and get in the shower. Take care and wish me luck! :)",
