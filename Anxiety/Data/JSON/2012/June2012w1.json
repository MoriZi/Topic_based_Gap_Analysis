            "selftext": "This past weekend I took a trip from Los Angeles up to Portland, where I'll be moving in a couple of weeks to go to culinary school. The last time I made that trip, just under three months ago, I was absolutely miserable the entire time. I almost broke down completely on the plane ride, could hardly eat at all for the two days I was there, and my anxiety made me shake it like a Polaroid constantly, in the immortal words of Mr. Andre 3000. \n\nBefore I left on Friday, I was incredibly anxious. I needed to take an entrance exam, finish up financial aid paperwork, and get fitted for a chef's uniform all just an hour and a half after landing. It seemed so overwhelming and I really wasn't sure I'd be able to deal. But surprisingly, I was completely fine. \n\nBarely even a twinge of anxiety in the security line and in the crowded rush of people in the terminal. No horrible nausea or claustrophobia on the plane, and when I got up I didn't worry about my legs giving way beneath me. I made it through all the stuff I had to do at my school, smiling and talking naturally to everyone without stumbling around or feeling as though I was wearing a cheap mask. For once, I let myself be *really* happy without thinking about whether or not it's \"realistic\" to feel that way or if I \"deserve\" it. \n\nI've been on an SSRI (Lexapro) for about three and a half months now, and the difference has been like night and day. I was so afraid of getting on medication (what if there are horrible side effects? what if it destroys my personality? what if it makes my head fall off? blah blah blah), but I'm so glad I finally did. \n\n**Sorry for the wall of text, but I just wanted to let everyone on here know that even if you've tried a million things already, don't give up. I know that I'll probably have to work with and around my anxiety issues for the rest of my life, but that's okay. Now I know that the downs all have their ups, and that's something worth fighting for.** ",

            "selftext": "I just got done meditating, and I had a realization about my anxiety, and anxiety in general. I understand each of us has our own unique life and experience with anxiety; my intent is not to prescribe some miracle solution to anxiety for everyone, though I believe this is one powerful tool and attitude toward gaining ultimate peace.\n\nHere's an analogy to explain this realization. If a person loses both their legs, they are probably going to be very bummed about  it. They could spend the rest of their lives in sorrow wishing they had both their legs back. But the fact is, they're never gunna get the things back (save for possibly cyborg legs in the distant future... which would be pretty awesome)!  On the other hand, if they accept this reality, that their legs are long gone, they can live with this dilemma, but still move on to enjoy all the wonderful things that life has to offer. Case in point: I went to high school with a guy that got drunk and passed out on some train tracks. He lost both legs and an arm. To this day, this guy is one of the happiest guys I've ever met. His legs and arm are not conditions for him to be happy.\n\n\nWith this line of thinking, many of us have set a condition for us to be happy: we will be happy once we get our peace back, and until we do, life sucks! Stop fighting anxiety. Stop wishing for your legs back. The real issue is not the anxiety, it's the judgement of the anxiety that perpetuates it. It's feeling the slightest bit of tension (which is totally human), and then your mind making it 10x worse because \"I shouldn't feel this way.\"\n\n\nThe funny thing is, once you adopt an attitude of acceptance, your anxiety tends to disappear. But if you go into it with an attitude of, \"I accept this feeling, now why won't it go away!\", it's ineffective. Learn to accept anxiety like an old friend every time it arrives. Attacking the root of anxiety is to wholeheartedly accept it. Trying to consciously will acceptance into your life isn't very effective (at least in my experience), and for that, I highly recommend checking out /r/meditation.",

            "selftext": "Here it is, 6AM, the regular time for people with anxiety to be awake. I can't sleep because I have this crippling fear that my boyfriend is going to cheat on me. I have always had fears about this because, ever since I was younger, everyone around me had boyfriends who would cheat on them. Literally: almost every relationship any of my friends/sister have ever had has ended in the guy cheating. Witnessing this kind of pain that my friends have to go through over and over again just makes me so afraid that I am going to get hurt. And the stupid thing is (this is how I know it is my anxiety that is making me feel this way, not any rational part of my brain) that I would honestly rather break up with my current boyfriend than have our relationship end with cheating. \n\nThe particular trigger for this fear was that last night we were texting until about 1AM when he called me (he works at a restaurant and typically ends up closing) after work. He said he was going to get a drink with his coworkers. Now in my irrational mind all I can picture is him going out with like 5 attractive women dressed to impress while I am sitting at home on reddit. I had to honestly fight the urge to drive the 45 minutes at 5AM this morning to see if his car was in the driveway or if he slept out last night. This is what my anxiety does to me. I FUCKING hate anxiety and how it makes me feel. As a normal individual there is nothing to really make me suspect that he is cheating. But anxiety just cripples my ability to participate in relationships. How do I tell someone that because they didn't text me before they went to bed that I got no sleep and am probably going to be anxious until I hear my phone buzz again with a text. This was how my last relationship ended... I kept nagging the guy I was with to text me more because it made me anxious when I was just left hanging, and he ended up saying that it was too much pressure for him and it needed to stop. \n\nI know that a lot of people feel this was after reading r/anxiety enough, but I just wish that people could understand how it feels to live with anxiety on a regular basis. If people just knew how it felt, I think more people would be supportive of loved ones with this crippling disease. I come on here and rant way too often, but the other part of my life is I actually have very few friends, and by that I mean I have one friend but I don't really feel comfortable talking to her about anything like this, so when I come on here it's basically like I am talking to my friends. Because even last night, I was trying to get out of the house to distract myself from thinking about my boyfriend and the ever-present possibility of him cheating, but all of my \"friends\" blew me off. I wish I could just be normal.\n\ntl;dr my anxiety about the possibility of my boyfriend cheating on me is ruining my relationship",

Before I can even ponder an idea it flys out of my mouth. I can cover this with (awkward) humor most of the time, but given that I work in healthcare, even a single slip up can make me sound a lot dumber than I am. Recently, one of the residents at the facility I work in was having a minor medical issue. In reporting this to the nurse, I listed off a complete list of symptoms... that another resident was displaying. I corrected myself and no harm was done, but I could not stop thinking about that single mistake for the next two days. I literally could not sleep because I couldn't distract myself from the anxiety.\n\nSo, my question is, does anybody else do this? What are some of your coping strategies if you do?",

Basically I have been having stomach issues since last October and I've done blood tests, I've done ultrasounds, the one where you have to drink barium and they do like an xray thing... Nothing comes up. Or well basically it is not an ulcer. \n\nGastroscopy is when they stick a camera down your throat. Now I'm not actually particularly afraid of the process because I just want to feel better, but what I am extremely afraid of is being sedated. I don't like the feeling, I don't like how I feel afterwards... It's almost a phobia. They have another option where they spray this stuff down your throat to numb the gag reflex. Now what I *didn't* know was that it would feel like my throat was swelling up and that I could not swallow(I was swallowing but I couldn't 'feel' it). This is where it all went downhill. I started to hyperventilate, and the doctor lost his patience with me and went to sit in the corner. Thankfully the nurse was very good and she escorted me to another room to calm down and to think over if I wanted to go through with it. My throat felt like I had a horrible sore throat by this time and the spray/liquid stuff didn't sit well. I threw up. \n\nI couldn't do it. I left. \n\nI feel so fucking disappointed in myself. I hate this anxiety. I hate that I feel like I don't have any options about my stomach... wtf else are they going to do? I don't want to be under anesthesia because even the thought of that is a bit triggering. \n\nHow do you guys deal with medical procedures? Also how the heck are you supposed to deal with doctors that have no sympathy for mental health? He kept telling me I just need to 'calm down'. I know most of you guys will understand that that is the most useless thing to say to someone with anxiety and under a panic attack.\n\nThank you for reading.",

            "selftext": "I had really horrendously bad anxiety issues at the beginning of this school year. Like I would skip lectures and stuff because I felt like people were staring at me all the time and it freaked me out. I worked through it eventually, after a lot of reading and meditation and encouragement. But I feel like if I sit at my parent's house over the summer I'll relapse and have to deal with that all over again. So I want to do something during the summer that will keep me on my  toes mentally, I guess?\n\nThings I've thought about so far:\n\nI live in Washington DC, so maybe I could hang out around monuments and **museums**. I'm not about to randomly accost tourists on the street though... so maybe I could work as a guide?\n\nI thought about a **customer service** job of some sort, but I feel like in those sorts of jobs you get a lot of negative people and that would set me back.\n\nI've spent a lot of time in **bookstores** reading, but [I'm scared of talking to people in bookstores because this is what I feel like people who are reading think] as opposed to \"Hey I'm reading something you like you should ask me about it\".\n\nI applied to work at a school with small **children** because kids are nice to you, and even when they're mean they're not mean in such a way that triggers my anxiety.\n\nThose are the things I've thought up so far. Feedback and more ideas would be nice please :)",

            "selftext": "Hey /r/Anxiety. I just found out you exist and I love you for it. \n\nAbout five years ago, after graduating high school, I went to my local community college. I signed up for four classes, picking them out carefully, with a schedule I could keep. As soon as I got to my first class... A huge panic attack. I couldn't do it. Everyone was looking, watching, judging... So I hid myself in the very back corner. I wouldn't other anyone there, even the teacher. I made myself invisible. \n\nThe thing with being invisible is... No one tends to notice when you're gone. I skipped a day, once, thinking, oh what does it matter. I'll just take this one day off. It'll get better tomorrow. \n\nIt didn't. It snowballed. I missed more and more school until I either failed or dropped out of all my classes. This happened four times, in four different semesters, in three years. \n\nI've thrown away hundred, probably thousands of dollars. It's been two years, and I've been self employed during that time. I have a completely flexible schedule and I know a degree will help me. But i am downright *terrified* of going back... Of everything happening all over again, of wasting all that time and money, to have my self esteem completely smashed all over again. \n\nHas anyone dealt with anything like this before? What can I do?",
