            "selftext": "So as as  kid I used to be very extroverted, although deep down I had a primitive version of anxiety. Small physiological responses such as chest palpitations, an inner feeling of dread and over-thinking things in a  way that was uncommon for children of my age. As I grew older my anxiety grew and manifested itself in new forms. I became increasingly reclusive and spent a lot of my preteen years playing halo on xbox live. But at the same time I love socializing, once I get to the party or meetup with my friends I get a \"high\" of it. I enjoy being around other people, and come home with a happy feeling. The problem is the next day I feel really anxious about it and have trouble socializing again for a few days, and when I finally agree to meet up with my friends, I have this overwhelming feeling of dread. As I walk or commute to the agreed meetup location, I have a subconcious feeling or \"back of the head feelng\" of anxiety that nothing I can say to my self can make subside. This feeling only reaches its peak when I say hello to my friends and doesn't go away until at least 30 mins into socializing.\n\nDoes anyone feel the same way? ",

Wow what a difference and it has been only a week. Today I went into a mobile phone store because I had a problem with my phone. I have been avoiding doing this for a year because I knew every time i go in there I have a full blown anxiety attack. It is terribly difficult to communicate your needs to someone when your heart is pounding, hands are trembling and your sweating like mad. I can't make eye contact  and I feel incredibly ashamed of myself. Today when I went in nothing happened. I was able to make eye contact, smile and even cracked a joke! Wow my life is changed.\nI am new to all this... has anyone been able to stop taking meds and still feel this way?",

I would do things their way even when I had another idea in mind.

I save that part of me for the people who deserve it.\n\nToday I was put in a situation where I had to make a choice, I did not know how the person would react to my decision and I had two choices.  Do what they would have wanted and make them happy while I was not.  Or - do what I wanted to make me happy, and leave them unhappy.\n\nThe old me would have not given it a second thought, and made the choice that would please the other person.\n\nInstead, I went ahead and made the choice I wanted. \n\nThat person isn't happy... but it won't kill them!  And nothing bad happened to me due to putting myself first.\n\nI wanted to share this as I'm sure there are a lot of people in here that live life to please others.

(Which is obviously stupid.)\n\nI think I've watched too much TV. You see these characters with their whole persona and life story displayed on their face, in their body language, and how people react to them. Maybe if I'm coming across as an anxious, pathetic person to other people in real life then that will define who I am as a person.\n\nI need to realize that we're not shallow characters on TV, and what other people think of me doesn't matter not just because I don't need to care what they think, but because even if they do judge me badly that doesn't define me as a person.\n\nI just thought of this and it made me feel great, can anyone else relate to similar fear or realization?\n\nAlso it's worth mentioning that while part of me thinks I don't care what everyone thinks, it's important not to care that you actually do care a bit what people think of you. (If I *actually* didn't care what other people thought I'd would walk around in PJs and wash once a week.)",

            "selftext": "I've been thinking about writing this post up for some time, but I never felt that I was quite ready to write a retrospective on my time spent with anxiety. Now, however, I feel that I've reached a point of sufficient stability that such a retrospective is appropriate.\n\nThe basic goal of this post is to remind people who are currently struggling with anxiety that things *can* and *will* get better. Your path may be more or less difficult than mine was (and is!), but it is a path which will eventually see you leading a more full life than you are now. Don't succumb to your anxiety, even if it feels insurmountable. \n\nAnxiety entered my life when I was just starting my second year of university. I had experienced bouts of anxiety throughout my life, but had never experienced a panic attack or anything severe enough to indicate anything more than a slightly nervous disposition. Therapists would later try to find roots of my fully-blossomed anxiety in my childhood, seeking some sort of unprocessed trauma, but there was nothing to be found. To this day, I remain convinced that I simply experienced a change in my brain chemistry that had rather severe implications for how I would live my life for the next several years.\n\nThe first panic attack hit when I was out for a walk. For the previous few days I'd had a rather nasty cold, and I was still congested. Walking usually helps my sinuses clear, so I went out for a brisk walk. My first indication that something was wrong came when I realized that my heart was beating very quickly, and that I was sweatier than I should have been. I started to feel afraid. Suddenly, my body shifted into overdrive. Every nerve from my toes through the top of my head felt like it was buzzing at full strength. This, combined with the still-lingering illness, was too much, and I started to pass out. I put my head between my knees, and the world came back enough that I was able to call one of my roommates, who came to get me.\n\nThat was the first panic attack that I had. For the next four hours, I lay in bed wondering what on earth had happened to me, occasionally getting bursts of dizziness and the same sizzling feeling in my nerves. I didn't know whether I had some kind of neurological problem or not, whether or not I had experienced some kind of cardiac event, or whether it was just low blood sugar. I was terrified. \n\nFrom then on, I was perpetually nervous about having a similar attack. I noticed patterns in when the attacks would come: typically when I was alone and traveling between my house and university, or while alone at work. I also noticed that, for reasons unknown to me at that time, if I called my parents or girlfriend and spoke with them for a minute, the attack would subside. I started to exhibit what would become entrenched patterns of avoidance of the trigger scenarios - I avoided being alone, I avoided public transit, I took shifts that coincided with those of my coworkers. My girlfriend and parents started getting two or three calls a day from me, for no particular reason - I hadn't yet told anyone about the attacks.\n\nEventually, I acknowledged that something was wrong, but I still had no idea what. I went to my doctor, who ordered a battery of tests - blood tests, ECG, and so on. All of them came back completely normal. The attacks still persisted. Then I ran into a description of the symptoms of a panic attack online, and felt that sense of dawning realization. Every one of my symptoms appeared on the list, and the triggers for the attacks were mentioned as common triggers for panic attacks.\n\nAt this point, I felt somewhat better - I knew, at least, that I wasn't experiencing the symptoms of some horrible heart defect. But foolishly, I did not seek any treatment. I thought I could deal with it on my own.\n\nOver the next two years, the attacks worsened. I broke up with my girlfriend and moved back in with my parents. I started to fear the times when I knew I wouldn't be able to get in contact with someone on the phone, because if I had a panic attack I wouldn't be able to stop it. This worrying made me anxious, and this anxiety made panic attacks more frequent and severe. Previously talkative in class, I became more withdrawn. I still spoke up, but it required a conscious effort, and frequently after speaking up I would need to get a glass of water to calm myself down. I was having between two and three panic attacks of moderate strength per day. Still, I didn't pursue any treatment.\n\nThen, at the start of the second semester of my last year of undergrad, shit hit the fan. It was a Thursday. I left the house at 12:04 to walk to the bus stop. My mom was on the phone with a friend in Ontario. At 12:12 I got to the bus stop, already feeling somewhat anxious - I knew that I wouldn't be able to contact my mom if I had a panic attack. At 12:15 the bus arrived, and I got on. Immediately, I felt even more uneasy. But I persevered, and took my seat. The bus I was on passes through an area which has no cell phone signal just before it reaches the university. At 12:19, the bus stopped in this area to let off a nun. I looked at her as she got off, and checked my phone. 12:19, no cell signal. Immediately a severe panic attack hit. I felt like I was being hit by a train. I was dizzy, sweating, my heart was pounding. I needed to *run*, but I couldn't. The attack lasted for half an hour, and only subsided when I took a cab home.\n\nFinally, I sought treatment. However, the attack had been severe enough that I now was psychologically incapable of being alone for any period of time, or of taking the bus on my own. If I was, I would have a panic attack. Fear took over my life. Despite weekly therapy sessions, I was more or less unable to attend class. This caused academic complications for me that I'm still sorting out. \n\nFlash forward eight months. I'm living in my own apartment in a different city from my family and fiancee, I'm in graduate school, and I teach three tutorials a week. When I go home to visit, I take public transit and the ferry alone. None of this bothers me anymore. The panic attacks are under control (touch wood!) - in fact, they simply do not occur anymore (again, touch wood!). How, you might wonder, did this happen?\n\n- **Cognitive behavioural therapy**\n\n- **The right medication**\n\n- **Support from those close to me**\n\nI cannot stress enough the importance of these. CBT is one of the more difficult things that I've done, but it was immensely helpful. I still use the techniques I learned when I'm feeling anxious or nervous about, for example, giving a lecture. The medication is also immensely helpful. I don't take much (75mg of Effexor daily), but it provides me enough of a leg up that the CBT techniques can really be effective. Without CBT or medication, I would not be where I am today.\n\nThe support from others is also of great importance. What I have found is that the hardest step for me was being open and honest about the problems that I was facing - once I told the people I trusted about my anxiety, they were happy to help me, and their support made an immense difference. I spent a long time trying to hide my anxiety and pretend that I was okay, but bottling it up did me no good whatsoever. Letting a trusted few know about it and telling them how they could help me was one of the key steps on the road to winning my life back. \n\nI don't think that I've \"conquered\" anxiety by any stretch of the imagination. There will be times in my life when it crops up again, in times of stress or illness. But I have my life back now. And if you are experiencing anxiety and feeling lost at sea, remember: *it will be okay. Both now and in the long term, you will be alright. In the short term, the fear that you have will subside. In the long term, you will learn how to work with and disarm that fear, and you will be free to live your life the way you want to again.*",

I post a lot on /r/depression and maybe this should go there, but I think this belongs here.\n\nI've been depressed for a couple months as a result of years of anxiety; social situations, school, dying, women (never even kissed a girl, only told my best friend that I love her didn't work) you name it I worry about it and probably failed at it. \n\nA few days ago my friends addressed this depression and gave me an intervention. It felt so good to see that I'm surrounded by people who love me when I felt so alone (even though I had a lot anxiety the whole time). I knew I had friends but seeing it is so much more real, but every time I think about them I start to cry and worry. I'm so happy and it feels like it could go away so easily. \n\nI visited an old friend of mine and had a great time, but these ideas kept creeping in that his family would be murdered or that he would die overseas (he joined the army since I last saw him and it scared the shit out of me). I was glad I cut our time short because I couldn't hold the tears back much longer.\n\nI feel haunted; I always worry and imagine the worst case scenario happening to me or the people I love and usually I assume that whatever's going to happen it's my fault. I think the more I grow and develop the more horrible the things I can imagine and feel. It's especially bad when I'm alone with my thoughts; I can't stand trying to fall asleep at night or taking a shower or just anytime where I'm alone and not distracted somehow; sometimes I can occupy my thoughts, but not as much anymore. \n\nI always feel guilty even though I usually do the right thing; I'm as good as any person can be, but I don't feel that way. I used to smoke a lot of pot and I still do, but I just don't have as much since this whole depression thing started. Maybe that's what was holding me together because my anxiety meds don't seem to really do anything.\n\nI never feel good enough try my best, but since I was diagnosed with depression I started drawing and playing guitar and I'm also working on ideas for a board game (I love games and play a lot with my brother and his friends) and thinking of working on a screenplay again if I get any inspiration (most of my ideas were kind of pulp horror and grindhouse movies and I don't want to think about that as much.)\n\ntl;dr: I imagine horrible things happening to people I love and I can't stop my anxiety form creeping in.",

At first I thought my almost constant nausea was a symptom of my anxiety, which stems from PTSD. After going off and on meds, struggling with daily nausea, ruminating thoughts, and panic attacks I went to the doctor who found a B12 deficiency. This lead me to further testing and finally a naturopath who diagnosed leaky gut, which can cause anxiety and a host of autoimmune issues.\n\nI just wanted to say to everyone who has anxiety **remember to look at your diet!** Sometimes just cutting out caffeine or changing some eating habits can make a huge difference mentally as well. All the doctors just wanted me to go back to anti-anxiety meds which I had a bad experience with. I'm not saying that I won't ever go back on meds, or that everyone with anxiety has leaky gut, but I have noticed a huge difference in my anxiety since altering my diet. This may not apply to everyone, but it doesn't hurt to look into what you are eating. ",

            "selftext": "Hi, guys. I need help, and I need it really badly. I'm 22 years old and it feels like my life ended a long time ago. \nWhen I was 16... I just gave up. I had no friends, no skills, no interests, and no hopes for the future. Everything just went out the window, now it's time to just sit and wait for death, however long that may take. Of course, at that time, my parents were alive, and the only thing I had to look forward to was seemingly infinite school days. Having a roof over my head, ever, was not even on the list of concerns. That was a given and something that would always be true. I was an idiot. \n\nNow I find myself broke, jobless, skillless, friendless, parentless. When I leave the house, all I can think about is how much everyone already knows everything about me at a glance. I'm an outcast... a weirdo. Someone who just isn't quite at the same level as everyone else. That's how it has always been, and it just kills me. Why is everyone else in such a hurry to get around and go see people and do things? Why aren't I? \n\nPretty soon, there won't be any turning back for me. I quit my job taking inbound calls (you were supposed to take a new call within 15 seconds of hanging one up... oh my dear god that is not enough recovery time from human interaction). My boyfriend is so fed up with my \"episodes\" that he's about ready to just leave. No one understands, or even wants to. They say to ignore the feelings. To just get over it. To just grow up. Fuck... whatever the solution is going to be, the word \"just\" does not belong in front of it. How do you just IGNORE the roaring lion with its mouth positioned around your head?\n\nI can't afford therapy, or a psych, or anything. My strategy for the last 6 years has been to sit and wait for it to be over. To wake up and be a normal, functioning human being. That probably isn't happening. Now my brain is trained. It's formed these habits, and I can't escape them. I have no interests and no passion. When I sit down to attempt to learn something, or read something, or create something... or to do ANYTHING, my brain just says no. No, this is wrong. No, I have to be scrutinizing every muscle that twitched on my face today. No, I'm supposed to be beating myself up. Wait, stop, no, I have to beat myself up for beating myself up. Rinse repeat. Eventually, I get so angry with myself for not having gotten anything done that I'll just resign myself to never achieving anything. All over again. \n\nLately, I've even gotten violent with myself. Someone said something that triggered this disgusting, self-effacing thought in my head. I reached some sort of critical mass and the next thing I know, we're on our way to the ER. I smashed my head into my knee, to stop myself from thinking the thoughts I had. My next worries were \"am I going to have a dent in my forehead for the rest of my life?\" Then, the ever popular... \"what will people think?\" \n\nI've gone in these circles so many times that I've walked myself into a hole, and it seems way too big to get out of. \n\nIf anyone has any advice to give, or some sort of anecdote, or any words at all... please. Help me understand that there's still a life for me somewhere out there. ",

However, I can't exactly initiate any instance where I can feel included in something that we all like (of which there are a lot of things, I just have trouble recognizing that a lot) when I feel like any suggestion I have will instantly be met with scorn, so I just end up sitting there feeling anxious most of the time until one of them includes me in something.
