I stated I need to make money between now and December because I am flying to see family members then.\n\nI thought dog sitting would be a great idea because I love animals and wouldn't have to deal with people for long.\n\nI got a slew of negative responses calling me \"weird\" to want to dog sit at my age, people telling me to \"get off welfare\" (I'm not on welfare),  telling me to \"get over it\" and \"get a real job\".\n\nThis is why I hate people. All I wanted to do was make some extra money. Now I feel like shit.\n\nEdit: Thank you all for your kind words, I'd respond to all of you individually but that would take a while XD In case you were curious, I was thinking of signing up for Rover.com or something.",

I have missed out on soo many experiences, job opportunities and I am really hoping to get better.\n\nThat is all. Just wanted to put this out there.

But lately in the last few weeks I have had nothing but constant anxiety attacks.\n\nIt usually is a thought or a minor discomfort, and the next thing I know, my stomach is set to vomit. I try to minimize the risk with mints or gum which help plenty in a social environment. I also try to carry around Pepto, which placebo or not in this circumstance should help.\n\nI am just trying to say, is there anything I can do to alleviate this, or will I always feel worried sick in public? Its been sporadic throughout my whole life. \n\nBut the worst part is once you feel sick, there is no going back. Its all in my head, and my head is sabotaging me. I can hardly eat sometimes because of a minor discomfort causes me to worry, causing nausea, and a full fledged panic attack. \n\nI really don't want to have to go back to my Celexa, I tried to make it so long with out it, but I think that was my only help to the anxiety. Until then, I have neurontin which should help. I am prescribed 2 100mg pills 3x daily, so I am hoping taking that more consistently would help. \n\n\nI just really want to know if there is any advice? This is the worst feeling for me and it so depressing to feel nothing but sickness while the rest of the world enjoys strolling around carefree and having fun, while I am constantly worried about vomiting. \n\nSorry for the long post, I cannot sleep because of this damn anxiety I got just typing this letter out.\n\nThanks for any help!!",

I've reached the point where I can clearly recognize my anxiety for what it is but I can't stop it. Why? I'm always in actual physical pain.\n\nI have severe IBS, but I was never tested for it. I'm poor so the gastroenterologist asked about my symptoms and medical history. I explained everything and, knowing I don't have money for tests, told me I have IBS. That was a year ago and since then, the IBS hasn't stopped.\n\nMy panic is linked strongly with a fear of being sick and dying. The IBS gives me horrible stomach pain, cramps, and severe nausea. So when I do have an anxiety attack I can tell that the heart palpitations, sweating, and whacky thoughts are just my anxiety. However, the pain keeps the anxiety going. I spend half the day in the bathroom thinking I have some heinous virus that's going to kill me. If I could just stop the pain I don't think my anxiety would be so awful. I've tried Bentyl, Promethazine, and Hyocyamine but they don't do much. I've also tried herbal stuff like ginger and peppermint tea but they also don't do much.\n\nAnyone have experience with this? What have you done to cope? I'm always terrified of being stricken with some disease and I can't live like this.",

I just can't seem to maintain a relationship with anyone. Lost almost all my friends from high school by constantly complaining during my senior year. I've had girls like me, but whenever a relationship got started, I would vigorously avoid them due to anxiety. My college friends tried to help me, but eventually gave up because I was too much of a burden. I'm constantly mad at the world for making me this way and for tormenting me for years. I would get down on myself because I thought the things I was going through were normal and everybody felt them too. I don't know if I'm any better since I was diagnosed. I validate avoiding my anxiety by using the disorder as a crutch. It seems the more I try to connect with the world, the more alone I feel. I feel so misunderstood and hate other people because they make it all seem so easy. I see happy couples and get extremely jealous. I see groups of friends hanging out and get depressed because I feel like I could never had that. I hate staying in and shielding myself from the world but I do it because its the lesser of two evils. I'd definitely be dead by now if I didn't have such a great family that I couldn't ever hurt like that. I don't know, I just needed to vent.",

I took the time to re-evaluate my life.\nIt was difficult, I was unemployed for about 6 months, doing job trials at places which made me feel ill (and not show up for on some occasions) But for the past 2 months I have found work in an industry in which I had no experience in, but has made me feel so comfortable with my life now and has given me the inspiration to create a new life goal for myself which I hope to achieve within the next 5 years.\n\nThank You!",

I also feel that my anxiety now results from situations where anxiety is an appropriate response, as opposed to the type of overreactions that anxiety-disorders create.\n\nThere seems to be a split on this forum between people who understand that there are successful therapy modalities for anxiety and those who either do not understand or think that they are different - that they have a type of anxiety or mind that cannot respond to treatment.  Having never actually tried treatment, it's hard to say that's  correct. \n\nIn any event, I am continuing my attempt to get as many of you aware of the **empirical research** into successful treatments for anxiety disorders of all types - social, phobias, GAD, panic attacks, etc.  \n\n**MINDFULNESS AND ACCEPTANCE BASED INTERVENTIONS**:  A meta analysis of nineteen studies found that \"MABIs are associated with robust and substantial reductions in symptoms of anxiety and comorbid depressive symptoms.\"  Available here:  http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22803933\n\nAnother meta- analysis found similar results:  http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20350028\n\nOther studies have been less optimistic, but it appears to be a good complement to another approach, Cognitive Behavioral Therapy.  http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20488270\n\n**COGNITIVE BEHAVIORAL THERAPY**:  Consistently found to have significant effects on anxiety.  It seems, however, to depend on the ability of the individual therapist to use it well.  I know from personal experience, as well, that CBT is a rather involved process that requires good direction from your therapist, and a bad therapist can get hung up and be unable to modify the approach slightly.  \n\n\"In conclusion, CBT appears to be both efficacious and effective in the treatment of anxiety disorders, but more high-quality studies are needed to better estimate the magnitude of the effect.\"  http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22275847\n\n\"Although the specific components of CBT differ depending on the study design and the anxiety disorder treated, meta-analyses suggest that CBT procedures (particularly exposure-based approaches) are highly efficacious.\"  http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20599133\n\n\nHaving gone through CBT with two therapists and by using a helpful book, and reading portions of a training manual and textbook, I have a decent handle on it, although I am not a therapist and cannot claim to be able to cure anyone.  I am always available to answer questions about how it works and why I think it helps, from my personal experience. ",

I ran a department without a budget and a horrible assistant who didn't do her job and I was not permitted to use any disciplinary measures. At the end of the day they told me I wasn't doing enough.

I can't look at a list of job opportunities without my heart pounding, my chest getting tight, and getting shaky. I honestly have no idea what I'm going to do, and any job that looks like a possible fit does not pay anywhere near what I was paying. \n\nI NEED a job. My parents are at the end of their rope, I don't qualify for assistance yet, and rent is due every month. I need to eat. My dog and cat need to eat. I can't be a drain on my SO. I am up to my neck in debt, student loans and credit cards from college 8 years ago. Bill collectors call constantly. I am terrified. Even writing this is causing extreme anxiety.\n\nIt's been 3 weeks and I haven't applied to a single job. The anxiety of another rejection is too much. The anxiety of getting pulled into another job where I am miserable is too much. The number of jobs listed is too much. Reading through a job description has become terrifying, as I always seem to find a skill I don't have and don't apply for anything.\n\nI don't know what to do. I don't have health insurance anymore. I have $20 to my name. I don't know how next months rent will get paid. And none of this can get me to apply for a damn job. Help.\n\n",

Apathy has taken over.\n\nI was a musician, and I appreciate that it saved my life by taking me away from my home town, and away from people who have either wound up dead or in jail.  And since I quit music, some of those who I played with have likewise wound up in prison or addicted.  And at 44, it's been decades since I was inspired to play.\n\nI'm a web developer of some 17+ years, and I appreciate the money it provides and feel fortunate to have it, but I really don't like doing it.  It seems so vapid and meaningless.  I feel like I had more to give at one point and I went for the money.\n\nI could change careers, but I have no idea what to do.\n\nOf my friends who are not in jail or dead, their numbers have gotten fewer.  I have a few I talk to now and then.  I have a relationship, but she doesn't understand and I'm always doing or saying something wrong.  I love her, but I haven't been able to do right by her.\n\nI'm agoraphobic and have been housebound for almost 6 years.  Before that, I had addictions, anxiety, panic disorder, GAD, OCD, depression.  I'm clean now except what my doctor gives me, and the antidepressants haven't ever done enough, and I've been on a lot and on high doses.\n\nI think about disappearing and leaving everyone alone and not bothering them anymore.  Other times I think about suicide, although I can't do it.  Sometimes I think about it every day for weeks or months.\n\nMany of those around me think I have the ability to control this myself.  I can't.  I wish I could.\n\nI feel used up.  I feel like I've tried enough drug and non-drug therapies that something should have worked by now.\n\nI don't know what to do from here.\n\nEDIT:  Paxil twice, Lexapro, Effexor, Anafranil, Zoloft, now prescribed Viibryd, Klonopin, Xanax.  CBT, tried ACT but have taken a break.",

Around six months ago, my GP prescribed me celexa/citalopram and I have taken that daily since. My parents have fought since the dawn of time and have had two major split ups that I recall. They live separately (except on weekends) but since a lot of drama happened in 2011, this year, they have worked really hard to like each other again and are sort of back together. They're both alcoholics. There's been a few instances of domestic violence, one ending in my mother nearly bleeding to death and needing her arm stitched up after \"punching\" or \"falling through\" a glass door (wow, this sounds so bad now that I'm writing it), plus I've called the cops on them twice and once they were both arrested - leaving me in-charge of my younger brother for the rest of the night. My father is controlling but it's almost like he has more than one personality, My mother is caring to the point of naivety (with my father anyway), same thing with the polar personalities. We're comfortable with money.\n\n**What I want to know is:** I think I have something more than just common depression and social anxiety. How do I go about... finding out whether I do or not? Or is this \"I'm not normal\" feeling just a product of low self-esteem and my unstable upbringing? If so, what can I do to fix it?\n\nI can't always access my feelings or memories. Even with this post, it's taking some time to remember why I've wanted to ask for help. Even though I may not always remember why, I feel like I'm \"damaged goods\" in a way.\n\nI always need approval of someone else; I get jealous when I don't get complimented and someone else does; I don't know what a \"normal family\" is; I've had cycles of long depression and then had a short period of feeling normal; I self-harmed every now and then, started doing it nearly daily at the end of last year, recently became clean as of a few months ago; not suicidal anymore but have been in the past.\n\n**tl;dr -** I think this has just turned into a big rant about my life and wanting someone to understand how I'm feeling and tell me *why*. Any advice is extremely appreciated.",
