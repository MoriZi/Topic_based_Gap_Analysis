I'm in MI and I'm suffering from Social Anxiety Disorder, Generalized Anxiety Disorder and Panic Disorder. \n\nLately, my roommate has been really distant and I kinda freaked out on her last night about how I'm scared that she hates me now. She told me to 'chill the fuck out' and I'm also scared that I made her really mad. I don't know what to do anymore. I'm really scared.\n\nBecause I've been thinking about .... suicide lately. I feel like I can't handle it anymore. I feel like if I lose her as a friend, then I have no reason to keep going. She's my best friend and I feel like she wants nothing to do with me anymore and that I'm a burden. \nI've started going to therapy again, but it's taking so long week to week. What if she bails on me because of my anxiety coming back so strongly? \n\nPlease help me!",

We study catalogues, watch football games, choose Sprint over AT&amp;T. We count the birds in the sky and will not turn from the window when we hear the footsteps behind as something comes up the hall; we say yes, I agree that clouds often look like other things - fish and unicorns and men on horseback - but they are really only clouds. Even when the lightning flashes inside them we say they are only clouds and turn our attention to the next meal, the next pain, the next breath, the next page.

            "selftext": "I'm 35 and have had anxiety and depression since I was 13.  I have a garden in the back of my apartment and in the front.  I have never done anything in the front garden over the past 3 or so years I've lived here except trim two trees because I am too nervous to work out there.  It is only a sidewalk away from the road and there is a medical building across the street that always has people coming and going during the day.  I always feel like people are watching me and analyzing me.  But today was so beautiful out and the flowers are coming up and I haven't seen much sun or been outside much since November.  So I decided I was going to try something.  Before I went out I set up a story for myself....that it was after the end of the world, and that I was the only one left.  That everyone I would see and hear were just in my mind, that they weren't real.  And for survival I had to tend to gardens to make sure plants were kept alive.  And it worked pretty well!!  Every time I started to feel nervous and self-conscious when someone drove by or pulled into the parking lot I told myself they weren't real and I am all that is and all that matters.  Maybe there is something to this....I may have to turn my mind into a video game when I'm out in public.  It probably won't work in all situations, but I'm getting older and I don't want this anxiety to keep making me unable to do fun things.  I don't want to become 80 and say...\"wow, I wish I had done simple things like played in the sunshine more.\"  I haven't even gone swimming in about 10 years because of my fear of judgment and being watched.  Something has to budge.\n \nTL;DR: pretending I was the only human left alive and that everyone else was a figment of my imagination helped me play in my garden :-)",

My dad was diagnosed with cancer in september of last year and passed away february of this year. Thats pretty much what everyone thinks is causing them. My first one happened in january, and they have been happening a different intervals at different intensities since then. Ive had ones so bad enough where i checked myself into a hospital, twice. They did several heart and chest scans, as well as blood labs and they all came back ok. \n\nIm not really sure what to do. Its starting to cause insomnia. I have trouble falling asleep and then staying asleep. this started to happen about a week ago. They perscribed me ativan for anxiety but i dont take it at the right times or at all even so i feel like its not helping, even with sleep. \n\nI am also seeing a counselor through my university, but i dont think i see him often enough for it to help so far.\n\nBasically im at my wits end. Im not really sure what to do. any advice is appreciated...",

Something that I used to wake up to as a child. Screaming my head off.. And I was afraid of this primal inner fear..\n\nUntil I realized. That this inner fear.. It is not there to freak me out. It is there to protect me, the fear has a purpose and its purpose definetly is not to give me another anxiety attack or\nfor me to feel it constantly for no purpose.\n\nIt is one of the last things I struggle with when it comes to anxiety. I have been rejecting this feeling, thus giving a rise to it.\n\nBasically I know I have this emotion inside of me and I know that this feeling makes me anxious. And I do not want to feel anxious. But it is like this glowing radioactive core inside of me that is pretty hard to ignore. All I have to do is \"look inside of me\" and there it is. Ready to make me feel deep fear.\n\nI guess I should not reject it.\n\nNeither should I check in on it every few seconds.. \n\nBut hopefully make it work right again. Ie. I should not feel it walking around.. I should acknowledge that it is there. It is not mysterious, it is not there to freak me out. I am not going crazy because of it. It has its purpose, there are times when we are supposed to feel feelings like that.. But not for a whole day. For no purpose..\n\nScientifically.. I think it is almost like being directly connected to the amygdala.. The neurons that are able to \ntrigger the flight or fight response.. After long period with anxiety.. I have become conscious of what is supposed to be hidden inside of me..\n\nAnd instead of ackowledging as part of me.. As part of me there to protect me.. I have been afraid of it.. Almost like it was this alien invader in my thoughts. Which it is not.. \n\nI hope my subconscious mind gets this message.\n\nAnyone else with similar experiences?",

            "selftext": "Let's start with a mini-bio.\n\nI've basically spent my entire life (I'm 19) trying to improve myself. In elementary school, I dealt with severe depression and anxiety, though the symptoms were quite twisted at that age. In middle school, I was bullied because I was socially awkward and didn't know how to properly react to situations. In high school, I began to realize just how fucked up I really am, and began my mission to improve myself.\n\nThe only thing I fixed was social phobia. I gained the ability to talk to people. But not comfortably.\n\nI had fairly severe panic attacks every day during the last year of high school. I could barely function, and it was a huge challenge to graduate that year.\n\nNow, about a year after graduation, I haven't improved at all.\n\nI'm *obsessed* with trying to improve myself, make myself better, learn skills, etc. But I fail at these attempts, every time. I've tried *everything* (seriously), and I don't know what to do now.\n\nMy problem is that I have spent my entire life trying to get better, and have gotten *nowhere*. I've began to slowly self-destruct (abusing my prescriptions, destroying friendships, self-harm, etc), because I've completely stopped caring about the consequence of my actions -- it's like I've been trained that *no matter what I do, there isn't a positive result.*\n\nEvery day, I spend the entire day thinking of what I can do to be productive, but I lack the motivation because I feel like shit due to the anxiety and partly depression. When I *am* on my benzos, I'm actually productive and happy because I can think straight and fearlessly socialize and do whatever I want... until I say \"fuck it,\" and take huge doses of the benzos because I figure I'm going to suffer sooner or later. This process has repeated for months.\n\nI'd kill myself if I had the balls to, but I don't have the balls to do it. I figure that eventually, I *will* overdose on something like benzos within ten years, but until (if) then, I don't know what to do. I want to self-destruct as hard as I can; smash myself into pieces. Ruin everything. Destroy everything I have. Because regardless of the state of my life, I'm not going to be happy.\n\nI'm posting this here because I'm wondering if anybody else has experienced a similar situation and perhaps was lucky enough to find a way out of it. I'm currently looking to experience something \"new\", like a psychedelic drug experience, since I'm too afraid to get a job at the moment and perhaps move out along with that.\n\nI don't think I've ever been more infuriated, pissed off, frustrated, and upset at my life before, ignoring the fact that I don't feel emotion at all.\n\nThe biggest trigger of my anxiety and suffering: *Not knowing*.",

Parents are completely unsupportive and don't realize that my current social issues relate more to social anxiety and not to my sexuality. At 0 friends at the moment, 0 ability to make and keep friends and no experience doing so due to systematic homophobia. I'd ask for advice but I don't think there is any.",
