            "selftext": "I'm currently being treated for dysthimia and social anxiety. One of the things I've notice since being on antidepressants is my anxiety is almost non-existant. \n\nFor instance... today I flew up to Washington D.C., normally flying is a test in my ability to hide anxiety as security, and the landings normally stress me out. I had no issues. Once in DC, I got lunch at a food truck (something else I have been too anxious about food safety to do before) after that I hung out in a Starbucks for about an hour before the interview I flew up for. I was able to ask for a refill of my ice coffee without issues (normally things that seem out of the norm make me nervous). My interview went through with out a spec of anxiety or feeling stressed, that has never happened before (I've blown interviews at the CIA, Microsoft, and Google before because of getting too anxious). After the interview I went to the Hirshorn Museum before having to head back to DCA to fly home. In the museum there is a set of open escalators that go from the basement to the third floor. While on the third floor escalator coming down, I was able to look down between the elevators to the basement and up at the ceiling without any vertigo (normally I get very dizzy from heights and I even had panic attack while on the Eiffel tower). Finally flying home again no problems with the flight or going through security.\n\nThe biggest thing here is how sudden the change was. I stopped taken wellbutrin last Friday and started the Abilify on Saturday (the Lexapro + Wellbutrin combo brought back all of my depression and anxiety when I had been doing pretty good on just Lexapro) I had an argument with my wife on Tuesday that triggered a panic attack. With the wellbutrin fully out of my system and the abilify taking effect it has been worlds apart different.",

It came in waves, and as much as I tried to stop it I just wasn't strong enough. I'm kind of afraid it will return soon seeing as I am still awake at 3 am. \n\nBecause of my anxiety, I can't sleep, I can't go out with friends, I can't be in large crowds, I can't do normal daily activities (ex. clean my room) and it has interfered greatly with my relationship with my boyfriend.\n\nI have tried therapy, medication etc. and nothing really seems to work.\nI feel like no one understands, so come share stories, tips, anything.\nI hope someone can relate to this.",

It is a middle-class disease, endemic in those countries which enjoy the highest standards of living and the greatest stability. We have banished fear, which is a healthy emotion, only to admit anxiety, which is a morbid one. We no longer wake up in the morning mildly astonished and delighted to have been safely brought to the beginning of this day. We no longer spring to our feet to satisfy ourselves that there is no immediate threat. Instead we come gradually to consciousness, and lie in bed in complete safety, gnawed by anxiety... The man who pins his faith on security is bound to suffer from anxiety, for he knows in his heart that however many insurance policies he takes out, he can never really be safe. This very night his soul may be required of him. It is only when he turns outward, to some end outside himself, in other words embarks on life's adventures, that he saves himself and exchanges anxiety for mere fear.\"\n\nI get anxious all the time about the little things in life, but isn't it because we have nothing to worry about except the little things?

At this time my anxiety is going through the roof. Near panic attacks all the time, shaking, trying to \"pet myself\" to calm myself down. I have my appointment, it's in this month...\n\nBut my insurance runs out in December. What if he recommends a therapist? What if I can't afford medication that he thinks will help... Will I have a few good months after starting it then fall spectacularly to pieces afterwards when I can no longer afford it? \n\nAll this thinking you can imagine is not doing a lot to help me cope with my anxiety. \n\nAnyone going through this?

            "selftext": "As I had mentioned in the previous post, the site I created didn't turn out the way I wanted it to.  Now, I have made the process MUCH simpler.  There is no registration, however there is still a login.  I have created 3 different users to log in, once logged in you may begin to tweet and share what is on your mind, anonymously.\n\nThe 3 logins are as follows:\n\nE.g. Username / password\n\nAnxietySmith / anxietysmith\nAnxietyJane / anxietyjane\nAnonymous /anonymous\n\nThe reason I did this was to keep the connection between the original twitter account, as well as giving people the option to at least reveal gender based on Smith/Jane, or none at all. The name is supposed to appear at the end of the tweet but doesn't right now, something I will fix.\n\nAnyways, I hope people find use for this, if not oh well.  As said previously, as someone who suffers from GAD and panic disorder, if I can help at least just one other person then it would make the work worthwhile.\n\nThanks for looking, cheers.\n\nEDIT: [Link for the lazy](http://www.shareyourfear.com)",

The only thing that keeps me sane is marijuana, but I can't smoke now because I have an interview/drug test coming up soon.  I am miserable.",
