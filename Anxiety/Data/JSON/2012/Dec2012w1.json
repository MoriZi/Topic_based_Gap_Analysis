            "selftext": "I've had anxiety problems for several years now, I'd been really great for a few years until the past few months, where it seems to be getting perpetually worse and worse. It's really bad this week, where I'm getting jittery and overworked about almost everything.\n\n\nI've always been bad with procrastination, but when my anxiety is flaring up I always get it **extremely** badly. As in, I've got a really important uni essay due in in a matter of hours, which I haven't done, but I just sit in front of the computer or books I'm meant to be reading, and not doing it. Every time I put my head to starting, I'll work for about two minutes, until I get worried about actually going through with the work. \n\n\nSomewhere I know I can do it, and as soon as I *start*, properly start, I can literally get it done in about 3 hours of just working. But it takes seemingly days of sitting doing absolutely nothing, not getting spurred into working.\n\n\nI can't think because I'm worrying about how I can't just get it done. Then I worry that I'll do it, but it'll be terrible. My housemate keeps telling me it's my fault, and that if I just sit down I'll just do it. But I literally can't! It's bad because I am clever, and I want to do well, but being nervous about my work really doesn't help and means I end up rushing everything.\n\nDoes anyone else have this, and have any ways to get over the avoidance?

I was on the brink of vomiting a number of times and even had to run to the bathroom because I was so sure it was going to happen. Instead of letting myself go in to a full blown panic attack, I let my body experience what it was going through. I kept telling myself that what was happening was my body taking care of itself. I excused myself from work for the day, came home and took a promethazine to get rid of the nausea and engaged in calming activities. By night time, I was feeling almost back to normal, to the point where I could eat some crackers and jelly, and felt stronger because of the experience. I'm not obsessing over it today and am not constantly scanning my body to see if I feel even the slightest twinge of nausea, thus creating more anxiety. I wouldn't say that I will welcome nausea in the future, but having been through it and at work of all places,  it is a lot less scary! I can handle this!",

This is one I found really helpful when I was feeling anxious this afternoon.\n\n----\n**Slow breathing exercise**\n\n*To be practised regularly and at the first signs of anxiety or panic.*\n\n1. Hold your breath and count to 5 (do not take a deep breath)\n2. When you get to 5, breathe out and say the word *relax* to yourself in a calm, soothing manner.\n\n3. Breathe in and out slowly through your nose in a 6 second cycle. Breathe in for 3 seconds and out for 3 seconds. This will produce a breathing rate of 10 breaths per minute. Say *relax* every time you breathe out.\n4. At the end of each minute (after 10 breaths) hold your breath again for 5 seconds and then continue breathing using the 6 second cycle.\n5. Continue breathing in this way until all the symptoms of over-breathing or hyperventilation have gone.",

What if they call me silly again?\"\n\u2022\tWe have a lot of armor\nThings you can do for someone like me:\n\u2022\tStick around\n\u2022\tAsk if we're comfortable in a place or situation\n\u2022\tBe willing to change the place or situation if we are not\n\u2022\tIf you ask and we aren't okay, but you aren't willing to change it, you lose our trust\n\u2022\tActivities that help take our mind off things are helpful\n\u2022\tTry not to take our reactions (or lack thereof) personally\n\u2022\tGive us time to respond to you\n\u2022\tWe will obsess over how we are being interpreted\n\u2022\tWe anticipate being judged\nThings you should not do:\n\u2022\tTell us not to worry\n\u2022\tTell us we'll be fine\n\u2022\tMistake praise for comfort\n\u2022\tAsk if we are \"getting help\"\n\u2022\tForce us to be social\n\u2022\tForce us to do things that trigger us\n\u2022\t\"Face your fears\" does not always work because- remember, scared of everything\n\u2022\tIt's more accurate to say we are scared of the fear itself\nIf you have an anxiety disorder:\n\u2022\tKnow that it is OKAY\n\u2022\tEven if you worry that it is NOT okay\n\u2022\tIt's still okay. It's okay to be scared. It's okay to be scared of being scared\n\u2022\tYou are not crazy, you are not a freak\n\u2022\tI know there's a person under all that armor\n\u2022\tAnd I know you feel isolated because of it\n\u2022\tI won't make you take it off\n\n\n\nIn my case specifically, anxiety affects all of my life. Every, single, thing that I do, is affected by anxiety. My anxiety affects me in the way that I feel sick and scared. I don't know what I'm scared of, so don't ask me. I don't know why I feel sick, so don't ask me. All I know is that I do, and the way to combat it is to avoid things that trigger me most. \n\tWhen I am forced to stay somewhere, my anxiety is worst. In class, in a car, in the mall, at a store. Being outside, being at home, at a close friends' house, are the safest I feel. At home, I feel very safe. This affects me in the way that I can't go out of town. I can't go visit people. I don't go to the lake. I don't go to the snow. I don't go to the mountains. I don't go anywhere that makes me feel scared. \n\n\tI did not write the part with bullet points. I copied it from a Reddit forum post about anxiety, because it applied very well. When I first read it, I cried. Not because I'm a pussy. But because it was the first time I felt like someone else understood me. The first time I felt like I fit in with other people. The first time I felt normal.\n\n\tAnxiety has been hard to deal with. Hard to live with. But, it has changed my views somewhat in a good way. Because anxiety affects most of my life, I see no reason to EVER be sad, angry, any bad emotions in any way. Mostly because my life is already filled with this. But I look at things so positively now. At least there IS something positive about anxiety. Something that makes up for some of the bad. My mind is opened so much to positive things, feeling good, being free, having fun, living life, being ME. Being who I want to be, not what anxiety is trying to force me to be. Things don't make me sad anymore; it's like I have a wall that blocks the bad, because I see no reason for any of it to exist. I'm very happy in my life, as much as possible. I want everyone to be this happy.\n\nI wrote this paper because I want people to know exactly what it's like. More for me to show people I know, but I think I may post it on some websites. I want people to know what I go through- what WE go through. I hope this has changed your view on the topic, or opened you up more. And I'm always willing to talk to ANYONE. If you want to talk, you can email me at marshal.lewis@yahoo.com.. I'll reply to everything :)\n\nBut please, know that you are NOT alone. You aren't the only one. I feel just like you do. I can relate.\n",

What started as a mere thought has manifested into an immense social anxiety and borderline paranoia (as my psychiatrist calls it) over the past couple of weeks. I shower every day, and only wear clothes that have very recently been washed, yet every time I take a seat in class, I am overwhelmed with the feeling that I am emitting a horrible odor that is offending everyone in the room. If anyone so much as coughs, sneezes, or sniffles, I assume that is it because of my odor, and thus my anxiety skyrockets. If just one person steps away from me for reasons that are not otherwise obvious, I assume it's because of me. I've become so obsessed with observing other peoples' actions around me that I can't concentrate on anything else. I'm already in danger of failing one of my classes.\n\nMy psychiatrist prescribed 50mg Seroquel for me to take at night. It helps curb a lot of the anxiety attacks and some of the paranoia, but it zaps me of all energy and doesn't do much to control the thoughts that keep me worrying. \n\nI'm so exhausted. I don't know how to get rid of these thoughts that cause so much anxiety, as well as shame and embarrassment. No one has ever told me outright that I stink, and my friends maintain that I don't. For the most part I know that it's all in my head, so how do I get it out of my head?",

            "selftext": "I have been resistant to getting professional help, probably because my dad's a licensed mental health professional and I'm very lucky/cursed for it. Our general consensus is that I have GAD, emetophobia, and hypochondria. I have constant neurotic conflicts DAILY, but I'll have my periods of peace and happiness, and I try to cultivate the things that keep me that way. So I wanted to share with you all what has helped me over the years.\n\n\n\nWhen it comes to life feeling overwhelming with things that need to get done:\n* dry-erase boards\n\n* dry-erase calendars\n\n* categorized lists of things in order of priority\n\n* journaling at night. Or, just notebooks filled with lyrics from my favorite songs because the mere act of handwriting feels good and takes my mind off things. Good practice for penmanship too. Channels all my jittery energy into striving for neat handwriting.\n\n\n\nWhen in the middle of a panic attack, it's very hard to kill it. There's not much to do but ride it through. Cry. If I'm not crying yet, I make myself. Something about tears kind of helps it along. I don't involve anyone because their sense of helplessness when seeing me lose my shit makes me feel worse. I open a window after a while. Go for a walk. Put on the \"calm down\" playlist which includes The Weepies, Lifehouse, Iron &amp; Wine, Edward Sharpe &amp; the Magnetic Zeroes, Norah Jones and the song called \"Regression\" by Dream Theater which I highly recommend. \n\n\nSmelling citrus or other pleasant aromas I've heard calms your brain down and may even help with nausea-related anxieties. I was on the verge of a panic just a little earlier and (sorry, weird confession) whiffed my roommate's Old Spice deodorant and I've since calmed down. \n\n\nGetting lost in a calming TV show or some light comedy. Or dark comedy. Comedy that makes all things shitty in life hilarious. Louis CK, Ricky Gervais, Monty Python... if I find a way to laugh at the ridiculousness that is my irrational fears, I find some control again.\n\nAnd lastly, trees. But this is tricky. You have to really know yourself and your limits for this to be beneficial because it can be equally counter-productive as I've had my thoughts racing too fast and lead to panic attacks because I overdid it. But it's quelled nausea for me before and calmed me way down. \n\nTea, yoga, exercise, drawing, painting, writing, talking to people who understand, looking at NaturePorn, soothing music, soothing scents, comedy, walking outside, reading... in one form or another, these things have helped me immensely. Sometimes nothing seems to work when in the clutches of the worst panic attack, but you there's no harm in trying to have these in your quiver for counterattacking it. Hope this helps, and please feel free to share what helps you! \n\nedit: formatting",

He prescribed me some Xanax for about 3 weeks and I only took it as needed, and it really seed to help me out. Today I went back to my doctor and he said that he didn't want me getting addicted to xanax so he prescribed me Zoloft. Zoloft seems a little bit sketchy to me in the sense that it can cause people to have thoughts of suicide. I'm just in here really to see what you all think about Zoloft. Did it help you? Has it ever caused you to feel suicidal? I also heard it kills your sex drive, is this true?\n\nThanks for reading.",

            "selftext": "Friday night I was feeling pretty good but I stayed up later than usual.  I couldn't remember if I took my pills or not, but I was fairly certain I did so I just went to bed.\n\nSaturday I woke up and was feeling fine, having possibly not taken my pills the night before didn't even cross my mind.  I made my lunch and put together a list of errands I had to run and headed out the door.  I drove to the mall about 30 minutes away and things started feeling a little weird.  I figured I was getting a little anxious about going out shopping along with 10,000,000 other people at the same time.  Not a problem right?  Well I parked my truck and thought for a moment and got that \"oh shit, I'm about to have a really bad time\" feeling.  Started up the truck and started back to the highway.  First red light I'm starting to sweat uncontrollably and feel nauseous.  Get to the highway and my body is starting to shake uncontrollably.  I seriously had to consider pulling over on the side of the road to calm down.\n\nHere's when things started to get scary.  When I get off the highway at my exit I'm no longer in control of most my body.  I had to seriously consider putting my emergency flashers on and running red lights and stop signs.  \n\nI made it back to my apartment and was shaking so badly walking in that I dropped everything I was carrying, twice, and could barely get the key in the door with both hands. As soon as I got in, I locked my door, took some Klonopin and laid down.  After a good nights sleep and only being awake for a few hours, this attack had completely beaten me up physically.  As soon as I laid down, I slept for 6 hours.  \n\nWhen I woke up I knew for sure that it was that I missed a dosage of meds.  My entire back was a solid knot.  My arms and legs were in serious withdrawal pains (Effexor is known for that).  I managed to take my normal dose at this point as well as was well fed and hydrated.\n\nHere I sit on Sunday now.  Things in general are much better.  I do have a nasty headache, but it's not as bad as it could be.  I'm trying to stand up to my anxiety and face my outing yesterday and run my errands today, but it's difficult to say the least.\n\nTL;DR: Make sure you take your meds as directed.",
