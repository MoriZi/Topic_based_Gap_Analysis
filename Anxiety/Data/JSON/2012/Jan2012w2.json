            "selftext": "(I posted this in [/r/stopdrinking](/r/stopdrinking) but I think it's pretty applicable here too. Maybe someone can relate)\n\nI'm usually my worst critic. In fact I'm too hard on myself. \n\nThis past while I've been dealing with pretty bad anxiety and depression. I don't know where it came from or why at this stage in my life (late 20's) it decided to show up. But fuck it, it's here and I'm doing my best to deal with it.\n\nSo anyway, tonight I had a first date. Now, normally I would have a few drinks before such an occasion - the old dutch courage, if you will - because I'm normally nervous in these situations. Add the anxiety on top of that and this makes dealing with nervous situations like this even worse.\n\nBut I said: Fuck it, I'm not going to drink. Whatever happens tonight I'm not going to drink. I'm gonna feel what I'm gonna feel and I'm not gonna dull it with alcohol. Feeling nervous is okay. I'm okay.\n\nI told myself: Who cares if you have an anxiety attack? Make this the worst date ever and have fun. Don't put pressure on yourself that everything has to go well. Make it the worst date ever and have fun.\n\nThis is just a mental trick I've started to learn. I tell myself that it's okay to be bad at stuff and it usually relaxes me.\n\nLong story short, the date went great. I have really sore shoulders now because of the stress and anxiety during it, but I never felt like drinking once. Drinking was my safety blanket. Now I'm glad it's gone and I can experience being alive without feeling the need to dull my feelings.\n\nIt's like I'm saying to the world, this is me. I'm nervous and anxious and stressed but I'm okay. These feelings are okay.\n\nTonight was a big deal for me. I'm making sure that the new me takes time to appreciate myself and I just wanted to share it with someone.\n\nThere were a few times where I felt the anxiety rise and I thought an anxiety attack was coming but I tried my best just to let go. And you know what? It never materialised. Not once. And, although I can't guarantee it, I'm petty sure my date never paid one bit of heed to it.\n\nAnxiety is the wizard behind the curtain, it's all smoke and mirrors. I have to learn to stand my ground and allow the feelings to be, just be, without judging them, without wishing them away. Because if I challenge the anxious thoughts, the panicky thoughts, the thoughts of impending doom, then anxiety turns out to be a con - it doesn't deliver.\n\nAlcohol used to cloud this. But now I'm standing my ground. ",

(GAD most likely the cause of the ulcers) Tonight was no exception. I woke up, felt this awful sensation that I was going to throw up or my stomach would burn itself out of my ribcage. I'm nauseated pretty much all the time, and have been to the ER on more than a few occasions because I couldn't stop throwing up and my liquids got depleted. I'm trying to do the right thing, meditation, breathing exercises, journaling, exercise, I cut out all fast foods, quit smoking cigarettes, and I start counseling with a new therapist on Thursday. I feel like I'm doing all the right things....but I'm not getting anywhere. Like I'm rowing a boat with one ore. I don't know what I'm looking for by posting this, just...reassurance? Maybe if anyone else has suggestions to battle my nausea and anxiety? It would be greatly appreciated. I love this subreddit and have found it really useful, I've never posted here but hopefully I can help/be helped. Thanks for reading.\n\n\n**edit** Thank you everyone for your support, you have no idea how comforting it is just to know I'm not alone! THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU!\n",

I have no idea how to handle this. I am beginning at a huge research university, and I am trying to figure out how to walk to all my classes so I don't have to take a bus or anything, and I'm freaking out like crazy.\n\nAny tips to surviving residential college life?

            "selftext": "Hi r/anxiety. Just found this subreddit while searching for others who might be in a similar place and wanted to ask a few questions. *(tl;dr at bottom)*\n\n**Background:** I'm mid-20's with a good full-time job and a wonderful life. Engaged to a wonderful loving partner and surrounded by very loving people. A few years ago, however, I went through a really dark period and dealt with issues such as self-harm and an eating disorder. Luckily before it could head down a more serious path, I began to realize the negative effects it was having on my life and turned it around through finding new (healthy) friends and relationships as well as physical exercise.\n\n**Presently:** Since that time, I've been doing really well. No issues eating or self-harming as I am now able to identify them as very shitty coping mechanisms and try to figure out the bigger stress triggers that lead to these impulses. And normally I'm quite fine - doing my normal daily thing and enjoying life.\n\nThe first time I began noticing my issues with anxiety, however, was about almost a year or so after my grandfather passed. We watched him waste away from cancer, which was awful, but he peacefully passed and it's not the first time I've ever seen death. We've had a few family members / family friends pass over my lifetime thus far and many of them from cancer.\n\nLooking back, I feel like something switched on about the year to year and a half after he passed - some kind of \"oh yeah, btw, you're going to die\" kind of mental revelation. It's not that I didn't know this - clearly we all do, but I began to think about death and what that meant. Fast forward to now and I'm ***still*** struggling with these thoughts. It's a daily bombardment of almost obsessive thinking. \"How am I going to die?\" \"Will I die first?\" \"How will that affect others around me?\" \"Am I headed into a dangerous situation?\" \"Is today my last day??\"\n\nI gave it a few weeks, thinking it would just pass. It didn't, I began to notice the cyclical nature of these thoughts and the lack of moving *past* them. Which got me really tense and nervous about myself and wondering what was wrong with me.\n\nIt's gotten to the point it's impacting my ability to enjoy life. For a few months I *really* struggled, then finally it abated somewhat and I wouldn't have those thoughts very often at all. Several months of relief and then suddenly these thoughts were back - and I feel silly for even having them, but they just won't quit. I've tried positive thinking and trying to distract myself, but it's not very effective as my negative thoughts feel very overwhelming.\n\nThe few talks I've had about it with loved ones results in them saying, \"Just don't think about it,\" and asking me why in the world I'm even thinking about that. I don't know and I wish it were that simple.\n\nOver the past few weeks, I've begun to experience some chest pains, light-headedness, and shortness of breath whenever stressful situations arise. A few really big stressers popped up and I would feel my mind go totally blank - can't even formulate a coherent thought or function like a rational person, feel like I have to forcibly remind myself to breathe and try to act normal.\n\nI begin to freak out far more than I feel I should, and combined with my everyday battle against morbid thoughts of mortality, I'm feeling really uncomfortable all the time. It's getting to the point I'm nervous it will start creeping into affecting the happy relationship with the love of my life / family / etc. and I don't know what to do.\n\n**Questions:**\n\n* What first steps should I take to alleviate these issues? Who can/should I see?\n\n* What am I even going through? Can anyone relate?\n\n* What are some short-term solutions to help me cope?\n\n\nAt this point I'm tired of the anxiety - so tired of feeling nervous and on edge, tired of not being able to enjoy calm, happy moments without the intrusion of these thoughts. I need help. Any advice / suggestions / tips?\n\n**TL;DR - Tired of suffering from anxiety for closing in on a year or so. What are some short/long term suggestions for dealing with this? Can anyone share similar experiences and possible tips?** Many thanks. :)",

I basically avoid people and think about what image I'm presenting, too much. I know it's sad and I hate myself for it, but I can't help it (just like my OCD and depression).\n\nSee like, right now, I don't even know what to say. I guess I'm looking for some kind of help with this. As far as I know I just have to force myself to engage in social activities, which I do try to do, but thanks to depression I usually don't find them fun or entertaining, just something to do. Just talking to people is hard for me because I don't have anything to talk about.

            "selftext": "I've been scared my whole life, and I'm really tired of it. I'm with a wonderful woman who I know I want to marry, and the thought of it terrifies me. Not because I think she will be a bad wife or mother, but actually the opposite. I imagine a happy, beautiful, spark of life slowly withered away by years of marriage to a failure. A woman who has no one to help her with her problems, because her husband doesn't have the confidence to help her. \n\nI picture having the happiest day of my life by her side witnessing the birth of my first born kid, then having a panic attack and hiding instead of going to work (which has happened), and losing my job, then watching them homeless and starving. I imagine her dying. I picture her leaving me. It feels like I have no ability to picture a positive future. \n\nI'm always so deep in thought that it annoys me to have conversations with anyone. I think about why I'm so scared all the time and how I wish my fear would go away. I have stupid thoughts that a normal person should have. I get scared, causing me to do something stupid. Then I'm scared to admit why I did it, because I don't want to sound like I'm using my problems to manipulate people. Then I worry that maybe deep down I am manipulating people, and I'm tricking myself into thinking I'm not. I worry that I have another personality I'm not aware of.\n\nNot long ago my brother had a mental collapse. He stripped down naked and screamed at my father and I about how we were illusions from the devil and how he was ready to die. That doesn't remotely scratch the surface, but I look at him and feel I'm doomed to the same fate. I can't handle going to work without stopping on the side of the road to cry my eyes out and yell \"i just want to go home\" at no one. How the fuck will I ever handle a wife and kids? \n\nMy girlfriend has too many problems to deal with this shit. She is from another country, and one of her close family members is very sick and without good medical care. She can't get a job yet, so she sits at her place and does nothing unless we're together. She needs me to be strong and be there for her. She deserves me to be strong. She told me a week ago she wants to go home, although now she's downplaying it. \n\nI'm so sick of being scared all the time, and just wish it would go away. I'm taking Paxil now, and the doctor doubled it to 40 mg this month. I hate taking this shit, but last time I stopped taking it I became really self destructive. So I have the choice of that or side effects from this stupid medicine. I have to shit all day long, I fall asleep in the middle of the day for HOURS some days even if I've gotten good sleep. Some days I can't even get an erection for sex, while other days it is the opposite and I feel like the kid from American Pie. \n\nI don't want to harm myself. I can't imagine myself working up the courage, because at my worst points I just want to hide somewhere safe. I daydream about just leaving at times, though. Wondering into the woods alone where my fear won't affect the quality of life of those around me. \n\nAnother odd thing is the \"breaking out of my shell\" feeling that I get a lot. At least once a week I'll have an epiphany about how I should live my life. I have a few good days, maybe even more, and I'm on top of the world. I tell jokes to strangers and get laughs, and am told by people I could be in standup. I feel like a new person. Then I'm back to feeling worthless. I tell myself over and over and over again that I shouldn't feel that way, but it overwhelms me. \n\nTLDR: vented a lot of stuff, so i'm not sure how to summarize it, sorry. ",

            "selftext": "Hi so I'm pretty new to reddit, but I've been reading /r/anxiety for a while and can relate to a lot of you.\n\nI started getting panic attacks a couple of years ago, which I can honestly say has been one of the most horrific experiences of my life, where I ended up in a and e thinking I was having a heartattack. Since that, it's really torn my confidence away from me. Not that self-esteem and confidence was that high before but somehow it made it so much worse.\n\nThough my panic attacks for the most part have subsided, my recent and quite severe issue is fear of public speaking. I was always quite scared of public speaking but I'd mumble through what I had to say, be it small presentations in front of class mates and move on after a little bit of anxiety about it a few days before. Since the panic attacks though it has just go so much worse. I dread weeks, even months before a scheduled presentation. If it doesn't count for my course I'll avoid it at all costs, such as calling in sick because it's that much mental torture to me. Even now with assessed presentations I can't actually face them. I've even e-mailed professors to conduct them in more private environments.\n\nNow I know that the only way to overcome them is by just doing them over and over. I do know that, but with intense anxiety it's never really that simple to face it. It's very taxing on my overall health and mental stamina, the constant worrying wears me out. I'm frankly sick of letting something so minor rule my life. I have been to see a doctor who has offered CBT and anti anxiety meds (citalopram / celexa). Though I'm quite sceptical if taking citalopram will help with stuff like this. I haven't started the offered therapy yet though due to horrendously busy university commitments.\n\nSo what I'm really asking is, fellow / ex sufferers what's your story? how did you deal with it? overcome it? etc. Did you ever do what I did and avoid them by calling in sick? And did the therapy I was offered help you? (even if not related to public speaking etc.)",

            "selftext": "I really hate doing this but it seems like anybody that i talk to doesn't really understand, so i guess I'm just going to go off here. Well to start i have two jobs, one in the morning working 7-2 and the other one working 5-2 am. My night job is only like a mile away from my house so i just walk to it however my morning job is about 20 minutes away from my house on a car so i depend on people to take me there because the craziness inside my head doesn't let me drive. Just thinking about driving gives me a panic attack when i try driving i just start shaking uncontrollably and i hate it because i hate depending off other people. now my ride's work schedule has changed so he can no longer give me rides to that job. I'm really stressed out, all of this is overwhelming my family keeps telling me, \"just ignore your fears and get a car you're 20 years old you should have a car by now you're not going to get anywhere in life without one\" i wish it was that fucking easy, i would kill to get over all these panic attacks and fears. It is really difficult for me to hang out with friends not just because im at work half the time but just the thought of going out to a party or anywhere full of people makes me freak out. I used to not be like this, i don't know what triggered all this i used to do stupid stuff that i regret deeply like drive around drunk or high. I always think that triggered it, just my stupid decisions. I am like a level 100 paranoid i have no girlfriend and its very difficult for me to get one, my last girlfriend died of an od about a year and a half ago and my way of thinking is that i cant get a girlfriend without a car, who wants a guy with no car? I cant catch a break i think im finally broken i don't know what to do i can't take meds because i hate having to rely on things like this to get by, this is how i quit cigarettes just cold turkey. To be honest that's the only thing im proud of in my life. I don't know there is so much more i could type but i know you guys have better things to do, i am not the only one with problems like these. I just wanted to vent out.\n\nOnce again im truly sorry for the length of this thing and thank you redditors if you stayed for the whole thing.",

            "selftext": "I don't even know how to start this post, so I'll just try: My whole life I've been pretty shy, talking only to some close friends and family, spending time mostly by myself etc. But when I was about 12 or 13 years old school started to really get me due to enormous bullying, I got even more insecure than I already was, when I was forced to say something in class, people would laugh, always, which of course led to me giving them even more opportunities to laugh. My grades, which used to be pretty good, dropped to the level where I just barely passed each year. Fast forward some years: Now I'm 23 years old, had to drop out of university due to depression and am suffering from social anxiety that can only be described as crippling. I have never had a relationship, hell, even talking to people I hardly or even don't know (fellow students for example) is way beyond me, might it be something as simple as talking about the course we're about to take or asking for the time. I hid from my roommates at every opportunity I could get, eating in my room instead of the kitchen, waiting to leave until I heard no voices and so on. Due to my depression, I'm also seeing a therapist (CBT) but that hasn't helped a whole lot regarding my anxiety. I have tried several times to force myself to social interaction, starting once again to do karate (every single time is like walking on coals while ice rains on you) and doing minor single-time things like meeting with people from a french course I had visited. Still, whenever I leave the house (something I try to avoid) and I hear someone laughing or simply talking, I'm sure it is about me, losing the small bit of confidence I had built up to leave in the first place. Talking to someone I don't know still is out of reach for me, thus eliminating any chances of a relationship which I by no means don't want, it's just I'm so afraid of being ridiculed and made fun of I won't even try to initiate something.\n\nI somehow resigned, accepting my fate as forever aloner.\n\nPlease forgive any mistakes in spelling and grammar, it's late, I'm no native speaker and due to my venting, this could be incoherent at times.",

            "selftext": "Sorry for the long post, thank you to anyone who reads or replies.\n\nI have whats probably mild-moderate anxiety: excessive/repetitive thoughts/worries, sweating of palms, mild social anxiety, constant lingering feeling of slight anxiousness/edginess.\nIf I'm anxious I'm just generally uptight, but not extreme anxiety in that I dont get a heavy heartbeat or panic attacks, but find myself taking sporadic deep breaths if I'm particularly anxious.\nI think my anxiety is a genetic thing as my family all experience anxiety\nand I've experienced anxiety my entire teen and adult life. I somehow doubt CBT will work, because my anxiety seems to be present no matter the situation. I've tried and manage to curb the excessive thought somewhat, but the feeling of anxiousness still lingers and the excessive thoughts affect my sleep, I wake up early thinking hard. Exercise helps but its still quite present and I have to exhaust myself to get a good effect from it. I've used weed for the past few years which was great but have built a tolerance toward it, no longer as effective, and its not the best thing to rely upon as a functional medication, affecting you cognitively.\n\nA therapist and doctor both suggested an SSRI but I have my doubts about them: libido effects, addictive potential affecting you if you even miss a day, memory impairment, terrible withdrawal brain zaps and worse feelings afterwards.\nI'm not sure my level of anxiety justifies such a drug. I haven't discussed other options with them.\n\nI recently tried alprazolam (a brand called Adco Alzam) for 2 days. I find on about 1-2mg of it a day I'm no longer anxious but normal, my excessive thought patterns disappear and it takes the edginess off and I feel somewhat relaxed but still quite focused, its really great. \n\nBut reading about issues with long term use, tolerance building, cognitive and behavioural effects, sleep effects and withdrawal seizures, I'm concerned.\nHow pronounced are these? Or are they more apparent in larger doses and in people with more severe anxiety?\nHow quickly does tolerance develop, would 1-2mg a day or every second day be sustainable for long term? (I'll take it when I feel I need it). What would the withdrawal effects be like on this dosage and usage?\nWhat other options do I have? What about Klonopin?\n\nTL;DR: Mild-moderate non-panic anxiety, worried about long term effects of daily 1-2mg of alprazolam, curious about other options\n\nEdit: Thank you to all who posted! This is such an amazing community. Where else can you find near instant friendly, informative, first hand advice like this...",
