            "selftext": "Just found this subreddit and I had to share something I realized today. I've been living with anxiety for as long as I can remember since I was a young child and I'm 22 now. I used to be on medication as a child, but I stopped taking the drugs of my own free will and have been un-medicated for 10+ years. Lately, it's been coupled with depression and I've been having occasional thoughts of suicide. Not even just passing thoughts, but lingering thoughts of not existing anymore and how I would end it and how it would be to die like that. I have very few friends and the friends I do have all know something is wrong with me, but I've never opened up about it - I can't.\n\nWhat I really wanted to share was this: breathe. Today I noticed something about myself I had never noticed before - every breath I take is too shallow. I'm nearing the end of an EMT course (finally doing something with my life) and I've learned many new things about the body I had never even considered before. When a person is experiencing trauma, the depth of their breathing naturally becomes more shallow as the rate of the breathing increases. This causes the oxygen level in the blood to drop and the brain is very sensitive to this drop. Deprived of oxygen, the brain doesn't function normally and anxious tendencies increase dramatically. After realizing my automatic breathing was too shallow, I began to purposefully breathe deeply with each breath. After a few minutes, I felt a tingling sensation in my face and scalp while noticing increased awareness of everything around me. I guess I could say I felt more lucid and more at ease.\n\nBreathe more slowly and breathe more deeply. The normal respiration rate for a healthy adult is 12-20 breaths/min and the depth (we call it tidal volume) should allow the chest to expand almost completely. My chest was barely expanding at all on each breath, this is called dyspnea and is an early sign of compensated shock. I also don't drink a lot of water which adds to the problems. People always say I look pale which is another sign of shock. Living on the edge of shock, experiencing trauma every waking moment, that doesn't help anxiety at all.\n\nMake sure you breathe properly, guys. :)",

            "selftext": "\"There are very few things in the mind which eat up as much energy as worry. It is one of the most difficult things not to worry about anything. Worry is experienced when things go wrong, but in relation to past happenings it is idle merely to wish that they might have been otherwise. The frozen past is what it is, and no amount of worrying is going to make it other than what it has been. But the limited ego-mind identifies itself with its past, gets entangled with it and keeps alive the pangs of frustrated desires. Thus worry continues to grow into the mental life of man until the ego-mind is burdened by the past. Worry is also experienced in relation to the future when this future is expected to be disagreeable in some way. In this case it seeks to justify itself as a necessary part of the attempt to prepare for coping with the anticipated situations. But, things can never be helped merely by worrying. Besides, many of the things which are anticipated never turn up, or if they do occur, they turn out to be much more acceptable than they were expected to be. Worry is the product of feverish imagination working under the stimulus of desires. It is a living through of sufferings which are mostly our own creation. Worry has never done anyone any good, and it is very much worse than mere dissipation of psychic energy, for it substantially curtails the joy and fullness of life.\" \u2015 Meher Baba, Discourses\n\nAnxiety is nothing more than a thought which arises within your mind reminding you of a past event. A mere thought of a terrible thing that could possibly happen is all that separates us from anxiety and freedom. Learning to feel  and accept the pain of anxiety because you understand that it is nothing more than a jokester bringing up past fears is the key to recovery.",

            "selftext": "Premenopausal, mentally ill women of Reddit, I have an important message for you. Many, many psych drugs cause serious birth defects. Psychiatrists often don't mention this to young women who have no intention of getting pregnant in the near future. But it's a real danger.\n\nIt's fun to have unprotected sex. A lot of fun. But when you're taking meds, getting pregnant is a risk you shouldn't take. I'm as pro-choice as anyone else, but I don't want to be FORCED to have an abortion because I accidentally let someone squirt me with their baby juice.\n\nI just started taking a new med, Depakote. The docs warned me about side effects but did not mention birth defects. I looked it up (then confirmed with three doctors- two psych, one obgyn) and if I got pregnant, it would be THE WORST THING EVER. Like, people on Depakote have been known to have babies born without brains. Zombie babies!\n\nSo if you're taking psychotropic meds, and you're getting a little frisky, wrap it up! Or better yet, start taking birth control. Giving birth to a deformed or still-born child will not be good for your mental health.\n\nIf you do want to get pregnant, or just plain don't want to use a rubber, let your psychiatrist know so s/he can put you on one of the meds that doesn't cause birth defects.",

They put me on an oxygen mask and that didn't help at all. I finally got to the ER and seen a mental health doctor which they did an assessment. I do have a history of depression and anxiety, but I've been on medication for years and I'm totally fine. I am not stressed at all in my life. \nBut I just couldn't concentrate! I was paranoid and the doctor asked me a question and I went to think about the answer and i just totally forgot in that split second. I was just staring blankly when the doctor asked \"did you heard me?\" I was like what was the question again? then I remembered. They gave me a clonazapam to calm down. it finally kicked in about 30 mins.\n\nThat was the scariest shit I ever went through! I still think it wasn't anxiety but something else.

My notes were saying when people are depressed or have anxiety issues their working memory is devoted to such thoughts (we all know this, when anxious I can't focus on anything and get stuck in a negative thought loop and come out depressed).\nAnyway, the point of all this is that they said you can avoid intrusive thoughts by using your working memory to do something else like a number or word task in your head (This ones sort of obvious aswell, its the reason I play the alphabet game or do times tables everynight to distract myself for long enough to fall asleep). Anyway, there were studies done on it and of course using your working memory to do a task (or distracting yourself basically) meant you were less likely to feel intrusive thoughts, which would be great for all us folks on r/anxiety",
