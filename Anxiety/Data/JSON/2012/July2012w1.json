            "selftext": "So I live in Chicago which has played loving host to a heat wave recently, and I've noticed that I have been much more prone to anxiety/panic attacks (especially during long periods outdoors). Temperatures have lingered around 103F during the day with between 50-60% humidity and not much relief at night.\n\nOne of my biggest triggers is when i feel like I can't breathe, so I figured it's  related to the combination of intense heat and humidity. The stuffy, thick air makes me feel a bit suffocated which can inspire a bit of an adrenaline rush and things sometimes snowball outward from there.\n\n I've been trying to expose myself to it as much as possible to get used to it and practice dealing with anxiety in uncomfortable situations, but I've had a few wicked panic attacks in the process. \n\nDoes anyone else find themselves more susceptible during this kind of weather? If so, what is it that sets you off? Let's discuss.\n\nNOTE: I am 22, male, and have been dealing with a panic disorder for about 4 years now. I've been through therapy and tried a few different drug combinations (Xanax only as needed has proven to be the most useful/least impairing), but I tend to prefer using breathing techniques and relaxation exercises to work through my panic symptoms. Also, From Panic to Power proved to be a useful book to me, but of you all have any other suggestions of books I would adore to hear them!\n\n",

My therapist has not officialy diagnosed me with anything yet as I have only seen her a couple of times. I have another appointment tomorow July 3.\nEDIT: I'm about to leave for my appointment. I will disscuss with my therapist about taking medication and will take with my journal. Hopefully I can get something actually productive done this time. I'll update afterwards on how it goes :)\nEDIT: I had my appointment and my therapist wants to diagnose me with OCD, she just wants to consult the child psychologist there first. I am also seeing a psychiatrist in two weeks to talk about medication. Thank you to everyone who is commenting :) your replies have all helped me and made my decision alot easier :) ",

For example sometimes if I feel like I'm starting to get anxious while I'm on the road I will hummmm, or constantly shift around in my seat. During real bad spots I'll compulsively check my heart rate (Presumably if I can feel my heart beat it means I wont die, nothing to worry about). Anyone else have these? ",

It started after having to visit/apply to college and not being able to get a job because I am too timid. I've always felt insecure about my future since I realized that it's something I'm going to have to worry about. I'm clueless and doubtful of everything I do and can't make a decision for the life of me. It's mellowed out here and there but overall there's just a sense of me not measuring up. It's constant and gets in the way of everything in my life.\n\nRecently, severely in the past few weeks, I've just got these extreme apathetic attitude and just feeling uncomfortable most of the time. I've lost my appetite, am experiencing nausea, can't really sleep at night. I've lost contact with most of the people I would associate with. The only person I ever really see or talk to is my boyfriend, and I feel as though I could lose him at any minute and have started getting paranoid and jealous. Especially because we're going to both be going back to school in two months and I feel I've grown too dependent on his company for my happiness. This is also my first real relationship and the first time I've ever had strong feelings for a person and I've realized how incapable I feel of being in a relationship, which is why I've always avoided them. Don't get me wrong, being with him is wonderful and I don't want it to end any time soon, but it both helps and hinders my anxiety.\n\nI have to compulsively check things and I just can't relax. Today I spent the day pacing around and looking out the window every two minutes, expecting something to happen. This is all I have been doing when I am at home.\n\nI rarely get out. I pass the time reading and painting and trying to keep my hands busy but I can't focus. When my family brings up how I don't have a job and how I need to have a thicker skin my eyes just start swelling with tears because I don't want to use this feeling of anxiety as an excuse.\n\nPart of me really wants to get help but I don't want to take anxiety medication. I don't trust it. I want to feel like I have more control over it. I don't know if I'd want to seek medical help as in a therapist. I've tried to research vitamins that help with anxiety and I might try that. I've researched all kinds of tips to help with this stuff but I'm just totally stuck. I don't want these feelings to take over but I don't feel like they are going to end.\n\nI know a lot of people who go through things like this and it becomes a habit for them and they grow used to it and I can't stand the thought of that. I used to be a passionate person who was obsessed with finding things to be in love with, and I've just grown dull since my second semester at college. I feel like a disappointment to everyone and like I'll never measure up. I just don't know what to do with it now.",

            "selftext": "Hi all, \n\nI'm seeing a new psychiatrist today...in about 45 minutes. (I blogged about this today at anxietyadventures.wordpress.com.)  \n\nThough I felt really uncomfortable with my last psychiatrist and think this new guy is going to be better my anxiety is still amplifying. \n\nIt's mostly just regular doctor visit anxiety (stomach knots/nausea, spinning thoughts, lightheadedness, throat closing) but geez louise. I hate this so much.\n\nMy irrational fear boils down to him hospitalizing me if I explain the full extent of my issues. It's irrational because I'm not a threat to myself or others...but the fear persists. It happens before any visit to any doctor. \n\nBlerg.",

            "selftext": "I need to find myself a new psychiatrist sometime soon, and I've been trying to think about what qualities I like in a therapist/psychiatrist from long ago... and wanted to hear about what people like about their therapists and whatnot. \n\nMy first therapist was actually still an intern at my college campus counseling program. The program only allowed you to get 12 sessions, but she requested that I finish out the year with her because I was working so hard and they granted me permission. I think that one of the main things that I liked about her is that she was so new at it. I felt as if she and I were discovering my anxiety and how to deal with it together. She didn't have a \"right\" answer, and I liked that because I still had a bit of my \"teenage\" rebellion in me. \n\nSo, what characteristics do you like in a therapist or psychiatrist?",

            "selftext": "For as long as I've known her, my girlfriend has had severe issues with anxiety and panic attacks whenever she's faced with a social situation. Whether it's out to the movies with friends, or even stepping outside the house. I know this may sound like borderline agoraphobia, but as long as she rides out the first couple of minutes of being in the situation, she'll be fine. When food is involved, it seems to compound the issue, making it a lot worse for her.\n\nShe insists that having me there makes her feel a LOT better, but she does admit that it's definitely still there. She also feels terrible about all this as she feels like she's personally weighing me down and stopping us from doing the things that we can do. What I've always told her is that it's all non-sense and reassure her every time that I'll be there for her no matter what, but I really feel like I'm running out of support speech whenever something like this happens to her.\n\nWhenever she has a panic attack or is feeling anxious, it just tears me apart on the inside. Reddit, what are some of the things I should and shouldn't do to help her?\n\nAny advice is much appreciated, thank you.",
