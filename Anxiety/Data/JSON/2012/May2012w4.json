            "selftext": "A little background to why I thought this up.  When I was younger (maybe 10/11) My dad had a golden retriever.  We would bring her for walks to the park.  One time I wanted to hold the leash.  Since these walks were uneventful, he let me.  Well, she saw another dog and started running.  I didn't have the sense to let go and she dragged me over some dirt and gravel.  It stung a little, but it wasn't anything too serious.  \n\n-----\n\nMy analogy:\nHaving a panic attack is like being dragged by an out of control dog.  You are just along for the ride and get dragged through whatever it wants to run through.\n\nLately, I've been better at aborting attacks.  It's like I have control of the leash. \n\nMy conclusion:\nI will never have control of the dog.  It's not possible to have complete control of another sentient being.  However, I can make sure the dog doesn't go beyond the reach of my leash.  Hopefully I won't be dragged through the gravel, though.\n\n-----\n\nHope you guys find this useful.  I know I did.  It helps explain things.  If it needs to be clarified, let me know!",

            "selftext": "23f victim of anxiety disorder\n\nAnxiety is worse than any physical pain I could ever recall. It hurts you deeply and so misunderstood! We're called crazy... because no one understands. Mind is constantly racing and your life IS your phobia. Screw deep breathing! I just wanted to be fixed! \n\nIt started when i was 16, I took a medication that I happened to later find out I was allergic to. It was a Sunday so I had to go to a health clinic because all the doctors offices were closed. My heart was racing (144 resting heart rate) and I was on the verge of passing out. \n\nPASSING OUT... FAINTING... that was NOW my phobia. I live in the south east united states so it gets really hot here. Heat scared me... low blood sugar scared me... bridges scared me because I couldn't pull over if I were to faint. (Or so I thought) I checked out from school every single day... until finally they sent me to the school shrink and I realized I had an anxiety problem. I did crazy things like not getting in a car unless it was already turned on with air conditioning for a few minutes and I had to have an ice pack with me. Always carried bananas and crackers in my backpack at school just incase I happen to get low blood sugar.\nAfter about 3 months they started medicating me. Lexipro...Buspar (both anxiety medications) stomach medication (due to the anxiety I was producing too much stomach acid) I was in HELL... I wanted to die. This was no way to live... I surely couldn't live like this forever. I couldn't drive... leave my house... hang out with friends. I was too scared... worst part is no one understood. \n\nFast forward to 3 therepists and 4 medications later I met someone who saved my life. She was a Cognitive Behavioral therepist... after 2 years of my life wasted to my phobia she fixed me. She forced me to face my fears. That's all I had to do.. face my fears! Cognitive behavioral therepy saved my life... I am now 23 years old and on no medications for anxiety. Passing out is not even a thought that crosses my mind.  Here's a few tips she gave me: \n\n* carry your ice pack around to hot places... you'll use it until you realize you won't need it anymore. (Use your crutch to help you get out. Slowly pull yourself apart from it at your own pace.) \n\n*DEEP BREATHING..deep breathing always made me feel worse... like I couldn't breathe. So I started to count.. 1..2...3..4..5... in....5..4...3..2..1 out. I was in control. \n\n*crossing the bridge was the hardest thing for me. I had to do it because I live in a small town where you HAVE to cross a 3 mile bridge to get to anything worth while. I would call my mom everyday to and from work or school. Making her talk the whole way. Then... I only needed her half way... then a quarter... then not at all. (Again using a crutch to help you... I used it until I didn't need to anymore.) \n\n*always carrying a small snack... turned into just carrying a dollar or 2 to go the vending machine just incase I was feeling a little low and hungry. \n\n\nAnyway I know this isnt much but I wanted to give some people a little hope. Seeing other people go through something that controls their life...its anything but fair. Its a long road but it will get better... this isn't the end. :) ",

            "selftext": "I am on the borderline of a panic attack.  My anxiety is very high right now, it almost feels like something as slight as a pin dropping could set me off into a full blown attack.  I have not felt this way in a while.  For starts, I'm 25 y/o, female, and have bipolar (I'm on medications..lithium, lamictal, and clonazepam for the anxiety mostly).\n\nI think my issue is that work is stressing me out.  I travel sometimes for work, but this month I have traveled every week, only being at home on the weekends.  And tonight I'm in a crappy motel.  It's loud, there's not much security, the room is SUPER tiny, so the environment mixed with \"I miss my home, and my dog, and my friends\" is just a lethal combination.  But I don't know what else I can do, fellow redditors.  I've already taken my medicine.  I don't want to take more than the regular dose.  I just can't control my own thoughts right now and it's making me feel nauseous and my head hurts and I just want an escape but there is none. I HAVE to stay for work.  And all other hotels in the area are booked.  I can't take a walk (normally helps) because the area is unsafe.  \n\nI'm trapped.  And so I am panicking.  I figured writing it out would help because I don't have anyone to call.  I mean, I DO, but I don't want to burden them, you know?  My dad is really sick so I don't want to wake my parents.\n\nI guess I just needed to vent.  And maybe hear ideas on other coping mechanisms.  \n\nArghh this is hard...internet hugs to anyone feeling the same way right now.\n\n\n\nEDIT: Thanks guys, so much. I'd thank you all individually but I'm actually sleepy and relaxed tonight! Yay! Funny how it (anxiety and panic) always seems like it's never going to go away...but it always does. Logically I should be able to remember that and get my thoughts under control. Oh well. I do greatly appreciate your support, I'm glad I found this subreddit...lol I just typed in the URL reddit.com/r/anxiety and assumed it was out there! Thanks again!",

She is and has been completely professional.*\n\nShe's also the most effective therapist that I've had.  I've been able to work with her to get reassurance and some skills to combat panic attacks.\n\nShe's around my age, maybe a couple years younger (mid to late twenties).  She's attractive to me.  She's really nice and is the first therapist that I've had that seems to really understand what's going on in my head (probably because of our common age group and that she's been in school recently and is familiar with the newest anxiety work).  We actually seem to have a lot in common - at least based on what little we talk about her experiences.  I also understand that part of the reason I may feel this way is that she is supposed to be a positive person in my life.\n\nI have a wife that I love dearly and two wonderful kids.  I wouldn't jeopardize this for anything, especially a little crush - even if the opportunity to make more of it arose.  \n\nIs it OK to keep up with the same therapist?  I really would like to because, despite my crush, I think her input and the goals that she helps me set are really helping me.  I personally think it is, but I am looking for either reassurance that I am thinking clearly or that I am just deluding myself.\n\nThanks everyone.",

My dad doesn't understand, he just keeps telling me to \"get out there\" and \"you can't do anything if you're in your room all day.\" \n\n\nI live in a tourist town. There are no permanent jobs here unless you get lucky. I apply for average retail jobs (CVS, Acme Markets, Kmart, Walmart, ShopRite, Wawa, Michaels, Bed Bath and Beyond, GameStop, Office Depot, JC Penny, Pets Mart, Dollar General, and more) every 60~90 days like clockwork, year-round. He insinuates that, because he sees me sleeping past noon, I'm a lazy piece of shit and I'm *clearly* not trying very hard to get a job. \n\n\nYou know what is popular in tourist towns? Restaurants. You know what positions have been open, for the past month, at these restaurants? Hosts and servers. You know what I can't do? EXACTLY THAT. I can *barely* interact with people via cashiering, and I'm going to take ORDERS for them!? I had panic attacks working in the CVS pharmacy when people would get mad at me over their prescriptions. The thought of getting somebody's dinner wrong scares the shit out of me.\n\n\nAnd it's not like I'm fucking squandering my time away in my bedroom. I spend all of my time studying (programming, history, misc research for my writing, art guides, music theory, cooking, and others) and pursuing my dream career (being a successful webcomic artist). In the past few months, I've taught myself how to draw. I couldn't draw stick figures before this year, and now I can *almost* draw people. Writing has always been a passion of mine, even when I was little, I would write and write, and everybody just fucking put me down for being creative. Teachers, parents, peers, nobody gave a shit that I could write except people on the internet. Nobody thinks I can be successful, nobody fucking believes in me, despite the fact that I have legitimate potential.\n\nEDIT: And he KNOWS I do these things, because I've *shown* him the progress I've made. He's an artist too, a painter, and I always thought he would understand, but guess what? OF COURSE HE DOESN'T.\n\n\nWhat the fuck am I supposed to do? Of course I want a job, I want income, I'd love to have fucking money. How am I supposed to get this shit across to somebody who is a primary source of my mental problems? How the hell do you fucking get a point across to somebody who *doesn't believe you*? ",

            "selftext": "So I\u2019ve dealt with anxiety for most of my life. It usually gets heightened in social situations. I\u2019m getting married in about a month, and was wondering if I could get some best practices for the big day.\n\nA big fear I have is passing out or excessively sweating at the ceremony. The wedding is at the end of June and it could be extremely hot that day. The church we\u2019re going with does not have air conditioning and I\u2019ll be in a tuxedo with everyone\u2019s eyes on me. That causes panic in me while even typing it. What can I do to calm myself down and to prevent excess sweating?\n\nI\u2019ve started seeing a therapist, but the advice he\u2019s giving me doesn\u2019t seem to be enough. It\u2019s cognitive behavior based and just involves \u201cvisualizing everything going right.\u201d I think I need more than just visualization though.\n\nI\u2019ve considered trying a benzo or getting on an anti-anxiety medication, but I also want to be able to have a few drinks on my wedding day. I know that once I do, I\u2019ll be a lot more loose and able to deal with the anxiety. But if I\u2019m on a meds I don\u2019t want to mix drinks and turn into a lunatic!\n\nSome of my other issues are hand shaking while eating in public, which is a concern for putting the ring on her finger, feeding her cake, etc.\n\nAre there any mental/breathing techniques you would recommend for my issues? Any certain types of meds to try out or stay away from? Any advice would be greatly appreciated!",

            "selftext": "Hi, r/anxiety!\n\nAfter several months of living with my anxiety under control, it appears as though things are going south. :( My depression suddenly flared up quite severely about a month ago, and hasn't gone away since. For me, the depression and anxiety go hand-in-hand, so this is very frustrating.\n\nI currently take 100mg of Zoloft and 25mg (I think) of Ativan as needed. However, I'm beginning to think I need a change in meds. Zoloft never really worked the way I expected an antidepressent to work, if that makes sense. I didn't really expect it to instantly cure my troubles or anything, but the medication only really ever took the edge off.\n\nSince everything's coming back with such force, I realized I need to get this under control once and for all. I don't want to even have to think about anxiety in public anymore. I'm willing to try whichever meds my psychiatrist recommends and will stick with whichever one helps me! \n\nSo, what are your experiences with Zoloft? Is it working like it's supposed to or am I right in wanting to switch? ",

I really want to focus on dealing with this, as I have a daughter and I don\u2019t want her to grow up with her mother being this way. I have vivid visions of terrible things happening - my daughter drowning, my husband crashing our car into a tree, my parents randomly dying, choking on a piece of steak and dying, my daughter eating a battery without us noticing and her dying, etc. The other day, my daughter fell (she\u2019s one year old, kids fall, I get that) and she fell on her face, and I completely lost it. I imagined her breaking her neck with the fall and dying, right there on the spot. She seriously cried for five seconds and picked herself up and ran off, but I was completely lost for the rest of the day, crying and unable to snap out of it.\n\nI have severe anxiety in the car and stopped driving six years ago. Even when I\u2019m riding in the car, I\u2019m so worried sick by the time we get anywhere that I can\u2019t enjoy myself.\n\nIt seems that every day I\u2019m just blinded by these thoughts, and the happier the day is, the worse they are. If I\u2019m having a wonderful day, the invasive thoughts are that much more pervasive, and I have to remember to smile and force myself to not cry. I have always felt that I can\u2019t allow myself to get too happy, because that\u2019s when shit will hit the fan.\n\nI love reddit, but I\u2019m constantly hitting the \u201chide\u201d button to keep myself from reading terribly depressing stories. I can only watch tv comedies anymore because I can\u2019t deal with watching anything sad happening in fear of these invasive thoughts.\n\nI could continue, but I think I\u2019ve gotten my point across.\n\nI\u2019m asking two things of you, reddit: 1) what is this? ocd? gad? It doesn\u2019t matter too much, I\u2019m just curious. 2) More importantly, what books can I read to help myself? I understand that I may need more than a self-help book, but this is where I want to begin. I can\u2019t help but think about a therapist sitting there listening to me and thinking \u201cSNOOOOOOORE\u201d while I blather on, and medicine is last resort for me, so I really want to start with some good reading.\n\ntl;dr - debilitating fear of death, looking for a good self-help book.",

            "selftext": "Hey guys and girls. I've had crippling social/general anxiety for years now. I managed to graduate with a psych degree and recently had some interviews as a counselor at a psychiatric hospital. I'm generally a shut in and this job involves dealing with groups of people all day long, running groups (charades, talks, games, stuff like that), and running meetings. Quite frankly I'm terrified and unsure if I'll be able to do it. I'm looking at it as an extremely intense exposure therapy session for myself. I think because of my struggles I will be able to relate and help people and that excites me, I feel like I could be amazing at the job, but I'm scared shitless. This isn't just in my head either the first interviewer even asked if I was \"kind of awkward\" and I just told him that I get a little nervous in interviews. But truth be told because of my anxiety I am pretty awkward these days. \n\n\nI think that because of my anxiety background I'll be able to relate to residents and be of help to them, and being in this environment will be helpful to me as well. I'm not sure what the point of my posting here is other than getting it off my chest and bouncing it off you guys. I'd like to hear your thoughts. This is an AMAZING opportunity that anyone with psych interests would die for, but man am I scared.\n\n\nEdit: Has social anxiety; typos in headline. *Quite frankly\n\nDouble Edit: I did not share my own struggles in the interviews, am I being dishonest?",
