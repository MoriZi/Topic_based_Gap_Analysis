It leaves me paralyzed - better to do nothing than to try and fail. \n\nSomeone left the following comment on my blog and it's been tremendously helpful, so I thought I'd share - \n\n\"Imagine two different scenarios of yourself 10 years from now. One scenario in which you accepted your mistakes (everyone makes them!), forgave yourself (you didn\u2019t murder anyone, you just were a little bit lost, so what!), and moved on and accomplished so much. In the other scenario, you never fully put the past behind you, you struggled with feelings of regret and shame, which caused unnecessary anxiety and made you just coast another 10 years and barely get by or worse.\n\nSo, keep envisioning your successful future self coming back in time, walking alongside you, encouraging you, and telling you to \u201crelax, don\u2019t get so worried, just get excited and passionate about your goals and have fun working hard towards them! Look where it got us!\u201d\n\nhttp://anxietyadventures.wordpress.com/",

I'm 18.\n\nAnyway, I had to get the results of a blood test and I had to make the call because I'm an adult now and no one can get them on my behalf. Allegedly. Fuck shit fuck wank shit.\n\nAnyway, I finally stopped putting it off and made the call. Nothing went disastrously wrong, I'm always afraid of silences, or stuttering, not hearing clearly, or not being heard clearly. All of which has happened before, when I was young. I never got over it, it was so excruciating I just decided I'd stop using the phone forever where possible.

So I decided to go with my roommates and a few friends. So I drank one beer, then went to get a refill. There were some girls there, and I told them I was a freshman. They're like \"Yeah Freshies!\" and tried to take a picture with me, but someone jostled me and I accidently spilled beer on some sorority looking girl. She took my full beer cup, said I don't deserve a cup, and dumped the entire beer all over me. I left immediatley with my friend, smoked a bowl, and went to sleep.\n\nFirst party I ever went to in my whole life, and I get humiliated like that. I feel like shit now. I am completely miserable here at college. I hate partying, and I don't know how I'm going to get along here. College just feels like high school all over again here. I'm depressed as hell.

            "selftext": "It happened Saturday afternoon.  \n\nNo warning, no trigger\u2014*my life isn't even stressful right now*\u2014just BAM.  Lightheaded, nauseated, falling\u2014I sat down, fast, and couldn't move.  \n\nIt had been so long since I'd had to deal with this, I didn't even recognise what was happening at first.  I felt tight, dizzy, confused, nervous.  And then the panic bloomed inside of me and my heart twisted and *I knew.*\n\n*No, no, not again.*  \n\nThe realisation made it worse.\n\nI was with a coworker when it hit, and I think I scared him.  I didn't mean to.  He was calm, professional, concerned.  He kept talking, asking questions, keeping an eye on me.  He didn't know what was happening at first either; I think we figured it out together.  He hit all the questions you're supposed to ask when giving care to someone who may lose consciousness, questions to ask while you're waiting for the ambulance to arrive:  *are you taking any medication right now?  do you have any allergies?  what did you eat today?*\n\nThe manager for the day (my close friend, thank goodness) found us half an hour later\u2014me sitting frozen, eyes closed, terrified and shaking; him sitting in a chair across from me, talking quietly and trying to help.  He explained quickly, briefly, \"I think she's having a panic attack.\"\n\nThey helped me move from the chair (so high up, dizzingly high) to the floor.  I convinced them not to call 911 (I'm not sure how; I couldn't have been *very* convincing\u2014the effort of talking was almost too much to bother).  \n\nMy friend sat on the floor next to me.  \"I'm going to stay right here until you're okay.\"  He offered me his hand, and I clutched it and tried to keep the world from spinning, the walls from falling in.\n\nIt crested, and began to fade.  Breathing started to come easier.  Eventually, I could\u2014*almost*\u2014laugh without hyperventilating.\n\n**But that was three days ago, and the tight knot of nervousness hasn't gone away.**  \n\nI dread another attack, and I'm trying to fight back the feeling.  I'm off caffeine (no worries of withdrawal; I only drink coffee or pop occasionally to begin with), I'm trying to process, I give myself dedicated time to relax\u2014but the knot is still there, and my worries about its presence are only feeding it.\n\nI don't know why this is happening again.  I'd forgotten what it was like to live with this shadow in my life, and I don't think I can bear it.\n\nSomeone, please.  Talk to me.  Tell me I'm not alone.",

I went over to my friends house the day after and helped her with things around the house and comforted momma's numerous friends that came over that day. Her best friend reminded me of momma's best advice.\n\n'Put it on the shelf, and deal with it later.'\n\nI've had a ton of anxiety lately, because of that and of life just not slowing down and rolling more shit my way, but every time I feel it coming around I just think that and it helps.\n\nIt's not a cure all, and it may not help those with severe anxiety issues but, it's helped me out. I still get the nausea and the shakes and I know those will never go away but for the most part life's been a bit easier in the anxiety department lately and I thought I would share. :)\n\nAs a side note, I just want you guys to know, that I think you guys are awesome.

            "selftext": "Hey there. I've come a long way with my anxiety and depression, and I decided to NOT tell about my story, but rather the way I handle things and make them better. These have helped me over the years with my stuff, hopefully it helps you too. Try them, no matter how silly they feel. It won't hurt you. :)\n\n**1. Take control**\nIf you sometimes have worse days, sometimes better days, try to take a break on one of the better days. Take ONE of your problems, put all the other things aside, and try to think the problem rationally. Why is the problem such a big deal? What causes it? When did it start? Did something happen in your life back then? Can you find any connections to anything in your life? List these things, clarify the problem to the extent. Trust me, even though it might make the rest of the day shitty, it will give you more control over the situation. When you feel like your in charge, you will definitely feel better. Be bigger than your problem. It's YOUR problem, so it should be YOU in charge, not the other way around.\n\n**2. Find things that make you happy**\nI love comedy films and series, so I watch them. A LOT. I also like singing, and whenever my girlfriend isn't home, I sing my heart out. Do that. Find things that make you happy and feel warm inside, and do those things when you feel down. Forget about all your worries, just delve deep into the happy things. It won't make the problems go away, but it gives you more happiness than the problem will, and that's what counts, if you can't have actual control over the situation.\n\n**3. Get help, and get it early**\nDon't crawl into a mental fetus position. Go out and talk to friends or family. If the problem is related to your friends / parents / relatives, go and talk to them, even though it feels difficult and you make them cry. Talk, and don't stop before you're finished. If you need, get a psychologist, psychiatrist or a psychotherapist, and talk about your problems. Never be afraid to talk. If you're scared to go to the mental care, DON'T. FOR F*S SAKE DON'T. It's the most ridiculous thing you can do to yourself. Just go and get help.\n\n**4. Don't get anxious over religion**\nI know this may hurt some people, but if you have problems with your religious views, try to remember this: no one knows the truth. Ever wondered what happens after we die? Nobody knows for sure. No one has ever come back to tell us. These are things we have no control over. There is going to be enough time to wonder about these, but if you have any other problems in your life, concentrate on them first. Don't get hurt by other people's views, no matter how much they debate over the Bible or the Kuran. Everybody has their own views over these things, and I think there's no two people that have exactly similar thoughts about religion or afterlife. It's your religion, and you don't have to decide just yet.\n\n**5. Trust future**\nNo matter how bad you feel now, you will get better. There will be better days, and they will keep getting better until you are the king of yourself. You cannot change the present, but you damn well can change the future.\n\nOf course, there's things that cannot be handled in a straight-forward fashion. Those things need professional help. But trust me, it will get better.",

I think my main problem is hypochondria; I remember being six years old and truly terrified I was going to have a heart attack. My parents thought I was just trying to get out of going to bed at the proper time.\n\nAnyway, I was wondering, what's the next step? Do I go to a doctor and say that I have issues? I don't want to look medication seeking, and I don't want to not be taken seriously. I'm finally looking into this because, for the last six months, I have been truly convinced I've had various forms of cancer. Doctors have found nothing so far. I'm becoming worried for my mental health. I can't take obsessing about my health any longer - it's driving me nuts. My husband, too. I'm constantly asking him if xyz means I have cancer. :(\n\nAs a side note, I'm not currently undergoing any kind of therapy. I'm a military spouse, and call me paranoid, but I don't exactly want all of my medical/mental health information to be in the hands of the US Government. I've thought about paying cash for an off-base therapist, but I have no idea how to even find one or anything. Plus my husband doesn't realize how bad my anxiety has really gotten because I mostly don't talk about it. Maybe I should tell him.\n\nAnyway, I'm just looking for some advice. Is anxiety medication actually helpful? Do you have anything supportive to say that will make me feel less insane? I have no idea why I am the way I am - I've been this way for as long as I can remember. But I just want to chill out!",

My chest can just start hurting and then I get caught in a cycle where I keep worrying about it and it just hurts more, or I just pay attention to it more. It makes me not want to eat, or do anything remotely stressful, or even move. And then I think that not exercising can't be good for my heart, and I don't know to what extent that is true but I feel like I'm slowly killing myself anyway. I had been walking every day for a while, but now I have an infected toe. I need to get that taken care of but I don't think I can handle that when I'm already so anxious, and it's so hard to calm down when I can't stop thinking about how much time I spend sitting or laying down or what if I put off going to the doctor too long and my toe gets worse or what if they don't get rid of the infection because they haven't so far. I just feel really bad right now. And trapped.",

Since I can remember ive always had fits about going to school and always had bad attendance and faked sick to get out of going.(I missed 45 days last school year.) I always will panic the nights before and in the morning and while i'm there i'm just socially anxious all over. It's gotten particularly bad this year. I missed the first day of school because my attack was so overwhelming in the morning. I have to be at school in 6 hours but I can't even sleep because of how panicky I am. I've been begging my mom to let me do online school but she won't let me. Does anyone else have similar problems? How can I help it? ",

But when it comes to any groups more than 4 people, I shut myself down, and I feel anxious and horrible.\n\nSo today, I went to a fraternity rush event, a BBQ, to practice talking to people, a lot of people. At first, going 1 on 1 or 2 with a couple brothers there was okay. But when big groups started to show up and form their own circles, I felt left out. I tried to squeeze myself into a group, but it just felt weird standing with groups of strangers that I don't know.\n\nSo after ~20 mins wandering around by myself feeling like crap, hating myself, hating my life, I walked out of the BBQ. \n\nI learned that my social anxiety issue is a lot bigger than I thought. Oh well. I do plan on going to another rushing event and try again.",

I need some healthy ways, and just encouragement. Also, I am still trying to find a job but my anxiety is hindering that process. How do any of you who deal with anxiety get things like this done?
