So here is my great message to everyone: It gets better. It isn't always awesome and yes, you will still experience anxiety; however, everyone experiences low points and anxiety. Every single person has stayed up one night freaking out over something that either wasn't in their control or was really nothing to freak out about. And it is okay. \n\nThe most important thing you can do throughout your entire time with overcoming anxiety is to love yourself. You are beautiful, wonderful, funny, smart, engaging, and just fucking swell. Remember that! Remind yourself of that. Focus on all the great things about you because if you just put yourself down, you won't be able to get up. I love every single person on this subreddit because you have all helped me and I want everyone here to know that you will get better. And remember YOU ROCK :)",

I have had so much anxiety built up about driving for the longest time and hadn't gotten much help with practicing driving from my parents. My friends helped me by letting me use their car to practice the past few weeks until I felt alright and then I just made my self go take it. I cried briefly before and mildly freaked out, but I took a few minutes to myself, made it through the test calmly, and passed! I am so ecstatic, I had to share. It's a little embarrassing to share with the rest of my friends and family, so I decided to share with you guys. I had tried taking it a year ago and failed miserably before even leaving the parking lot, I felt like a complete failure and idiot afterwards and was so afraid to come back for a long time. Now I can laugh about it! If anyone else out there shares the same problem, just practice until you can get as comfortable as you can then start making yourself go. The worst they can do is fail you, and you can always come back the next day to retry. This is just a HUGE weight off my shoulders and I am starting to feel more and more like a functional person every day. Sorry for the long post, just so damn happy about this!\n\n **TL;DR:**  anxiety about driving for many years, finally passed driver's exam at the age of 20.",

When we were at the party, we decided that I would drive some of the family's friends home, which was quite a long drive. When I was driving, suddenly the cops came and pulled me over. They told me that some people driving behind me earlier thought that I was driving unstable, and had called the cops as they thought I was drunk-driving. \n\nThe real issue here was when they pulled me over. When the cops walked over to my car, i suddenly started shaking, and I felt my heart beating extremely fast. As I didn't want my passengers to be worried, i focused a lot, and managed to stop shaking. They gave me an alcohol test, which was negative, told me not to worry (I think they saw how stressed out I was) and then I got in the car and drove away.\n\nI remained calm until i dropped off my passengers, and started driving towards my apartment. On my way home, a car behind me started flashing its lights repeatedly on me (in a tunnel), and at that point, I freaked out. I drove off the highway, and took a longer way home, just to get away from that car. When I parked outside my apartment, i just sat down next to the car, shaking extremely and I started crying, unable to stop. \n\nWhen I got into my apartment, which was hard (as I didn't get my key into the keyhole), i just sat on the floor, crying. As I am writing this, I am starting to hear things, and I fear I won't be able to sleep tonight...\n\n",

I made myself what people told me I was, just because I wanted things to be real.

One of them is mad at me for betraying her trust and telling her secret, but I didn't understand that she had put her trust in me at all. I didn't believe that anyone could actually trust me. \n\nAnd, I don't think I've ever had a secret. I share myself with everyone, and then practically disappear into a puff of smoke when they leave me. I am a story, a character I created for myself. And I have to keep that character up. One of the things I'm known for is being good at maths, and once I thought I failed, and I absolutely freaked out.

I hate lying so much. \n\nWhen I'm home alone, I feel like nothing. I get into this haze and I can't think properly, and everything is fuzzy and unclear, and all I have is apprehension and worry and fear.\n\nI just want to hide and be by myself, and not go to school because at school I have to work hard to be the person I'm supposed to be.

            "selftext": "I post from time to time under another username, but mostly lurk here rather than sharing my own personal story.  I just wanted to use this throwaway to say it's incredibly therapeutic reading about other people's problems.  And I figured I'm dump some of my own issues here just to make anyone who is feeling the same way feel a little less alone.  \n\nDoes this sound familiar to anyone?\n\nI've always been a bit anxious (social anxiety and hypochondria especially) but lately it's been pretty awful.  I had a cancer scare  earlier this year (a potential superbad melanoma that turned out to just be some burst blood vessels).  There was a lot of time waiting for pathology reports and during that I was a wreck.  I just couldn't stop thinking about dying and leaving my two little kids behind.  It was constant panic.  Just awful.\n\nSince then, my hypochondria has gone out of control.  I went to the doctor for a swollen lymph node (shotty, painless, firm, mobile, ~1cm maybe) in my neck.  He told me to ignore it.  Then 3 weeks later things kind of started to spiral a bit.  I switched primary care physicians in here at some point (how classic) because I couldn't get in to see the old one on the day I needed him.\n\nJust as kind of a rundown out of my journal:\n\n6/8/12:  Mild pressure in the back of neck.  No lumps or bumps there.  Strained?  Swollen left salivary gland.  Stone again?  Gland swelling went down with some massage.  Caught the stomach flu the kids have.  \n\n6/9:  Poking at the salivary gland yesterday, now the left side of my face feels numb from my ear to my eye.  Not really numb, because I can feel things fine.  It feels numb and then I touch it and the numbness sort of vanishes.  Pressure behind my left ear.  Maybe a patch of numbness on my left arm.  Brain tumor? Parotid tumor? or pinched nerve...\n\n6/14: Symptoms persist.  They aren't there in the morning, but only show up or get noticed at maybe 9am.  Saw doctor and asked for phych referral.  She checked organs and lymph nodes and ears and throat and breathing and told me I'd probably pinched the facial nerve poking at the salivary stone and it'd potentially take weeks to heal.\n\n6/20: Same symptoms, except no numbness in my arm anymore.  Maybe some on my other cheek?  No pain, but maybe just some discomfort in upper right abdomen.  Pain in right side of back.  Feels close to the surface.  Pancreas or liver cancer?  Peritonitis?  Referred pain from back combined with crazy brain?  \n\n6/21: Saw therapist.  It was OK.  She doesn't do CBT.  Meeting again in a couple weeks, will ask about switching to someone who does CBT.\n\n6/22: Same symptoms.  A bit of a headache (before it was just a pressure sensation).  Numb left middle finger.  Pressure above left eye.\n\n6/23: Vacation.  Not much anxiety.  Felt pretty good.  Mild headache/left face numbness, but not the center of my attention.  Finger is no longer numb.  \n\n6/24: Vacation.  Same.\n\n6/25-26@1:30am Moderate intensity panic attack.  Didn't sleep for around 3 or 4 hours.  Felt like I couldn't breath.  Headache.  Just couldn't sit still or stop listening to my body.  Mild chest pain on left side, but nothing I haven't felt before.  Should have gotten up and gone for a run or something.\n\n6/26: Severe anxiety all day.  bad headache.  trouble breathing.  left side chest pain.  very aware of the sensation in my abdomen.  I think it's getting worse.  And by worse, I probably mean I'm just noticing it more.\n\n6/27: Pretty relaxed.  Abdomen sensation is there.  Maybe some sinus pressure in right nose/under eye.  Not much headache/pressure/numbness.  I've lost 5lbs in a week and a half.  Yay?  Haven't been real hungry.\n\n6/28: Two newly noticed swollen lymph nodes that feel like previous ones.  Pinky tip sized in neck, slightly larger in groin.  Head pressure thing is better.  Almost gone.  Numbness is better but still there.  Sore spot at front floor of mouth under tongue.\n\nThe worst part is, I know this is all pretty classic.  Nothing that's going on is really outside of the realm of what could be caused by anxiety.  None of it is even really painful enough that I'd normally care about it (aside from the headaches)...more like, just a hyperawareness of my body.    \n\nI'm a scientist.  I work in medical research.  I have a great life, a great family, no substance abuse problems.  I exercise a lot and eat well.  I know how insanely unlikely it is that in the course of 20 days I'd go from a perfectly healthy 33 year old guy to one with some terrible cancer that affects my facial nerves, lymph nodes, abdomen, back, headaches...yet none of it rises to the level of terrible pain and I'm still able to carry on with all my normal daily activities (running 4 miles a day, taking care of kids, working at my desk job).  Cancer doesn't generally go from nothing noticeable to some sort of crazy super mild systematic thing in two or three weeks!   And if I were that sick, I'd probably not feel almost 100% fine from the time I went to sleep until an hour after I woke up.\n\nI know what a failure this health anxiety can make you feel like.  But it ain't your fault.  I'm doing everything right, but here I am.  It can happen to anyone.\n\nI'm going to kick this thing's ass and so can you.  I've started using one of the CBT iPad apps and it really helps sort of make the busted thinking process clear.  I'm going to get a better therapist lined up (thank god for health insurance).  One who specializes in health anxiety.  Writing all my feelings about this down in a journal is reassuring, but even better is reading about all other people experiencing the same sort of things.  So, thanks!",

After a few more doctor visits, she told me it was anxiety. As it progressed things got weirder, weak feeling in my arm and shoulder blade, a feeling like someone is tickling the inside of my head, a feeling like my head is numb or someone is pulling my hair back when I touch my scalp, nausea that came for about a week at a time, and odd visual symptoms that made me blink a lot and made it hard to focus (that one is really hard to explain).\n\nWhat made the \"anxiety\" diagnosis harder and harder to believe is that I was never anxious and am not an anxious person. Still, to this day, I don't think I have anxiety at all. I just feel sick. I am not nervous about going out, socializing, etc. I actually do everything I did before the anxiety, but just while feeling bad.\n\nI, of course, do now worry about health problems. Brain tumor, MS, etc. Again while I know this is a symptom of anxiety, it's not really debilitating it's just me trying to figure out while I feel like crap.\n\nHas anyone else had a similar experience?

            "selftext": "I've been suffering from GAD and Panic Disorder for over 4 years now (even though I've had anxious tendencies for longer). I dropped out of high school because of my anxiety, quit the only job I ever had because of a series of massive panic attacks while on the clock, have missed numerous appointments, dates, and possible job offers all because my anxiety holds me back. I've fallen into a rut where I do the same thing day in and day out, making money and enjoying a few hobbies as best I can through the computer. \n\nMy anxiety also comes in waves. For a couple of weeks I could be fine, but then I could randomly get a spell of anxiety that could last for a week or more. I'm currently in the middle of one that started after doing a large amount of yard work. I've been in a constant 'high alert' feeling for the last week, with little panic attacks sprinkled in here and there. I look back on how I used to be before all of this, and I also look and see what my friends and family who are my age are doing with their lives, the progress they've made, and it really brings me down.\n\nI have goals, dreams, desires, but I just can't seem to pull together the motivation to do anything about them. I feel as though if I try, I'll inevitably fail as I always have. 'What if I get a job at this awesome company?' 'Well, then I'm sure your anxiety will bite you in the ass, and you'll have to quit. Quitting will disappoint your boss, your parents, and yourself. So why try?' I know it's negative, but even if I try and drown out those thoughts with more positive thinking, it always is in the back of my mind. One step forward, two steps back. \n\nCan anyone else relate?",

I hate buttons. I hate touching them, and I hate clothes that have them.\n\n\nYour turn. What are your irrational fears? \n\n**Edit**: Wow! Thanks for all the responses.

I have had an almost continuous feeling of unease, like something is wrong with the world, but I can't pinpoint it at all. I also sometimes feel like I am going crazy even though I have no other symptoms of actually going crazy. I worry about mundane things to things that are totally implausible. It seems to happen randomly, although worse at night and in the evenings. Right now I feel upset for no reason.\n\nLast night I went to the urgent mental health clinic, although they did not give me any counseling. I feel like I need the answers to some questions while I try to get a real evaluation. I left a message at my old school's institute but they have not called back yet.\n\n1. What do I do to calm down when actually experiencing a panic attack?\n2. What do I do when experiencing a general low level of anxiety throughout the day?\n3. They prescribed me Celexa, but my roommate feels very strongly that I should not take it due to her own personal experiences, and my parents feel the same after seeing their friends' kid take it. Do any of you have experience with it?\n4. They also prescribed Trazedone if I need help sleeping (I think maybe I do, my sleep is often broken). Do any of you have experience with this one?\n5. Lastly, is this common for anxiety sufferers? No one has confirmed that I actually have anxiety. I'd appreciate knowing that I'm not alone, and would love to hear absolutely anything encouraging or helpful you may have to say.\n\nI'm sorry for the length of this post.

He had too much to drink and had not had much food or any water through a long day of drinking and dancing in the sun. I tried to take him back home on the subway; I didn't yet realize just how drunk and dehydrated he was. He began to panic and scream as we were on the train. He alternated between screaming and being almost completely unresponsive. There wasn't really enough food or water in his system throw up, but he was very sick. The EMTs brought a stretcher for him onto the train platform. I brought him home several hours later and he was panicking, although now sober enough to be more coherent. He spent an hour or two repeating how much he hated himself and how scared he was to me, and then eventually he fell asleep. \n\nI was very shaken that day, and cried often.
