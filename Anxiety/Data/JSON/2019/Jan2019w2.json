            "selftext": "I posted about this on r/offmychest already but I wanted to put it here as well with some more details about my anxiety.  I'm 25.  It feels like everyone my age is completely independent, with a serious career and a serious relationship.  I still live with my mom.  I've never been in a relationship.  I'm currently unemployed.  I have the full financial support of my parents.  Lots of people tell me I'm lucky and that I should drag it out as long as possible.  But I absolutely hate it.  I feel pathetic every single day.  I desperately want to be independent, and be a real adult.\n\nWith my anxiety, I almost always compare myself to others.  It seems like everyone else in the world is better than me and I'm constantly envious of everyone else's life.  All of my closest friends are married and/or have their own place to live and a real career.  I don't have any of those things.  Not even close.\n\nI also can't STAND to be perceived as younger than I really am.  I get incredibly anxious when people refer to me as a \"kid\" or imply that I'm not a \"real\" adult.  I almost had a breakdown at Thanksgiving a few years ago because my family told me I would be sitting at the \"kids\" table (all the \"kids\" in my family are legal adults, but it still felt so demeaning to separate us from the rest of the family).\n\nAnyways I'm rambling now but I just wanted to see if anyone else shares similar feelings about not being independent enough (financially or otherwise).  \n\ntl;dr Does anyone ever feel pathetic because anxiety prevents you from being independent?",

About 20 days ago I felt like I was having a heart attack and went to the hospital. Again everything came back normal. They gave me 15, 1 mg of ativan for emergencies.\n\nI had run out of my medicine zoloft and wellbutrin so I think that caused the spike of panic but since then my anxiety has been out of control. I lost 30 pounds since May but I still feel uneasy exercising. I'm back on my meds.\n\nOne of my anxiety nightmares is becoming an agoraphobic but now even the thought of leaving the house gives me chest tightness, arm feeling funny, jaw pain yada yada. It's never all at the same time accompanied by nausea and cold sweats and it goes away if I'm distracted or wait but I do keep a baby aspirin on me.\n\n Does anyone else have really bad anxiety and panic symptoms when they drive or leave the house? I also don't like to be alone either so I have to go places when my family goes places. How do you guys handle recurring issues?",

Haven\u2019t had a chance to go to a doctor and get professionally diagnosed. \n\nAlmost every morning I wake up on a work day, I will lie in bed thinking about how much I wanna stay in bed and not go to work. After a while of those thoughts clogging my head I begin to start feeling ill and that impending doom feeling coming on, despite me knowing that I\u2019ll be fine as soon as I get to work. This gets so bad sometimes that I throw up. It\u2019s awful because most of the time it\u2019s pure stomach acid. Some mornings are better than others, but the start of the week is definitely the worst.\n\nNot only that, but sometimes if I have something I\u2019m anxious about coming up I think about it so much I make myself cry and almost hyperventilate. \n\nI am going on holiday soon and one of the worst things about my anxiety is that whenever I am on holiday, I start to think about \u201cwhat if my boyfriend was cheating on me?\u201d which slowly manifests in my mind until I have fully convinced myself he is out there, right now, cheating on me, even though he really isn\u2019t. Then I feel like I\u2019m going crazy; sitting alone in a room being attacked by my own thoughts, pulling my hair, wanting to yell and scream, feeling completely trapped and isolated, and feeling like I might die. I do not ever want to experience this again. \n\nThis is pure hell. I am suffering almost everyday. Please help me. ",

            "selftext": "So you've now got a detailed journal about your depression, anxiety, anger and other feelings...you've written in detail about various events in your life that contributed to those emotions and are the root cause of your triggers. Now that you have this knowledge what's next? Nothing gets fixed by itself, nothing happens by accumulating knowledge on it's own...but rather, it's what you do with that knowledge.\n\nNow this post is ONLY for sufferers of serious depression and anxiety, because you guys are the only ones who are going to have any hope of understanding what I'm talking about. Those with a semi normal upbringing, as you know, have no clue what it's like to be us because it so very far out of their realm of experience in life. (Gotta love them for trying though...)\n\nMost of us would agree and readily acknowledge that the intensity of what we feel is due to multiple unhealed emotional traumas in our past... easy to say, but hard to realise the magnitude of the impact of that reality. You have, in your life many, many unresolved emotional wounds tightly suppressed in your subconscious. What does that even mean? It means that on a fundamental level your inner emotional and psychological harmony has suffered a serious fracture or fragmentation... especially when it comes to trauma in your childhood, such things as standing up for your thoughts, feelings, opinions and self worth were fractured by trauma...instead of being addressed and resolved, these things were considered by your subconscious as unimportant or even dangerous, compared to surviving the moment. That is why considering them now evokes intense feelings of danger in your subconscious...because your subconscious still believes that those lies are true. That is why we often become the emotional abusers of ourselves because that is what the trauma taught us to do to survive.\n\nThe next step is hard, because you have to do it when you feel bad...whether it's disproportionate anxiety, depression or anger or shame or anything else, when you feel the intense emotion, from now on let it be a signal for you that now you need to go to work on your subconscious... for now, we will call this work \u201cshadow work\u201d. We are trying to find out things about ourselves in our subconscious that we didn't even know that we didn't know...things that are supressed...particularly unfinished emotional business that never came to an acceptable resolution. This involves what we will call \u201cself talk\u201d.\n\nThe problem is that when we suffered trauma in our childhood we had lots of self talk that never came to an acceptable resolution...that's why they were suppressed because an acceptable resolution was simply not possible at the time. The kind of self talk we're talking about here is the kind you need when you feel your worst... instead of running away from the pain, denying it or supressing it, what I'm going to ask you to do is to go towards the pain, feel the fullness of it, sit with it a while and recognize where it comes from, how it originated...and now you need to imagine and pretend that you are talking to the child version of you that suffered that trauma... tell that child version of yourself what it needed to hear at the time, reassure it, love it, tell it that you're here for them and you won't let anything bad like that happen again. Tell them its ok to feel sad, scared or angry, spend as much time with this part of you as possible...this is where the healing and resolution starts to take place. Trust me, even for me, the first time is weird and confronting, but the more you try, the easier and more natural it gets...you might be surprised what you learn. In time try imagining what this child version might say to you in return... \n\nLearning these things taught me not to fear or hate my negative emotions, but to see them for what they really are... the supressed pain of an emotionally wounded child...that is not something anyone should run away from, deglect, deny, shame or hate... but it is a very vulnerable part of you that needs the tender love, care and reassurance that only you can give if you have the courage.",

My anxiety and just a the way my thoughts keep me feel like shit, as well as severe dpdr and major depression has made my life a living hell for years. I don\u2019t even remember what it feels like to not be in pain. For real.\n\nI feel like I\u2019ve done it all professional help wise, and honestly at this point I feel like there is no way out, it just never gets better.\n\nMy life has felt so weird, Just so painful. So my question is what are some tips to get through this? Maybe there is stuff I missed, and honestly I could use any help I can get. Any feedback is appreciated ",

This continued through my life and has slowly gotten worse. Over the years I've let my anxiety and mental health problems really get the better of me.\n\nBut for one things are looking up and I just wanted to share it with you guys. My husband and I are finally moving out of my parents house into our own place on Friday and I got myself a job without the help of anybody. I'm so proud of myself for finally being able to take this step and I'm so excited to be moving and having some independence again. \n\nThis has been the hardest time for me but it has all lead up to this moment and I'm so anxious and scared that I'm sick to my stomach but I'm so excited to be doing this finally. I feel like I've been waiting for this forever and things are finally looking up. \n\nThank you guys for all your support, I know I've never posted or commented but reading all of your posts and comments has always helped me feel better and helped me think through the situations I have been in. I just love how wonderful you all are to each other, it makes me so happy to read the posts here because of how nice you all are. \n\nI love you guys \u2665\ufe0f",

I touched my stomach and felt joy at my soft skin. Plans changed today and I had no anxiety, I just went along with it. My muscles are started to loosen up and my headaches gone. I\u2019m not irritable finally. I can be me and live my life again.\n\nAnxiety is literally like being in a prison in your own head and I\u2019m so grateful for modern medicine.
