Whenever I raise a point or ask a question I feel that people just look at me as if I'm stupid before answering.  I feel like people use a different tone of voice when explaining things to me.  \nI just keep thinking that I'm not good enough and not living up to expectations.  I was recommended for this job and given extremely high praise which played a part in me getting it, but I can't help thinking that I've turned out to be a disappointment and haven't been living up to that praise.  I know I'm not terrible.  But I make small mistakes and I forget to do things sometimes and I shouldn't be, because I hav pe enough experience to not me making mistakes.  \n\nI struggle with thoughts if my manager not liking me the most and because of this find it quite awkward to make conversation and be in the same room alone, which I'm sure doesn't help her feelings about me.  My previous job I worked under someone who was very hard on me to the point of bullying and I seem to be transferring my fears about that person to my current manager. \n\n I need some advice about dealing with nervousness at work, particularly around superiors.

            "selftext": "My twin and I have always been close but I would say that I am more independent than her. For as long as I can remember, she's always been in a scared state. I remember as kids we used to walk home from our elementary school which was only a block away and if she saw a grown up on the other side of the street or walking our way she'd drop all that she had and run home into our house. Then around the age of 11 she began to have a sudden fear of our dad who is probably the most charismatic person in our household, he jokes around a lot and there would be no reason for her to be scared but she was. Whenever my dad found a new route to go home she would freak out thinking that he would take us somewhere and murder us, and multiple times throughout the night she would wake me up because she was scared and thought she \"heard\" something breathing under our bed. \n\nI obviously tried to be brave and although I knew this was all in her head her worries always made me think if the worst things happening. Because of her scared state of mind, we have always had to share a bed and room. And we always slept with the hallway light on. If I ever got up to use the restroom at the middle of the night she would run to the switch and turn it on. We're 20 now and in college. We spent our first 2 years in the dorm and now we live in an apartment but still, she continues to sleep in my bed. It's a twin bed so it can be uncomfortable at times. And to top it off she still wakes me up multiple times to ask if I heard something or to tell me she had a bad dream. Sometimes on the nights where shes really scared she asks me to hold her hand or even hug her. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf I'm being honest I don't mind that I have to be there for her but sometimes I just want to sleep peacefully. And we've talked about how her doing this is selfish but she really doesn't care and continues to have this scared state of mind. I don't know why she's scared and don't know how she would resolve this issue.",

            "selftext": "This is a bit of a repost.   \n\n\n \n\nI 'moved out' in the past few months from my dad's, but I now live in a flat on the same floor as my mum (the property happened to be going and Mum mentioned it.) My mum is trying to treat it as if we are living together as much as possible, making excuses to come in and see me be that to do my washing, bring in a meal or invite me over to hers or out for lunch.\n\nI have a very hard time saying No to her. If I have a plan for the day and she invites me to do something then I feel anxious saying No and sticking to my plan. I feel compelled to be abandon my plan so as not to upset her, I feel I have to justify the plan as work or something jobs related. I know that it is acceptable to be unavailable because I'm seeing friends but not acceptable to be planning to go to the gym.\n\nMy anxiety about saying no to her is partly because Mum would stonewall me and refuse to help me as a teenager if I challenged her. The other is that I worried her by being very depressed and having an eating disorder during my young adulthood years. Since we both got therapy for an anxiety disorder she's been super-compensating for that, plus it is in her disposition to be anxious anyway.\n\nThe last time I talked about 'boundaries' and 'independence' to her she told me to \"stop talking like that, you sound like your dad\" and we fell out without her explaining it. I then felt a need to get her a thank you present for helping me around the flat and basically dropped the issue of having space altogether just to keep the peace.\n\nI'm honestly not used to having to invest so much time in a parent, my dad was pretty chill about when he saw me or not. I also get frustrated because my brother gets away with only calling home 6 weeks whereas I have to check in every 24 hours and see them every week (especially Mum, and ideally twice or more.)\n\ntl;dr Struggling holding boundaries with Mum due to history.. Do you have advice for how to change this?",

I get off when I think I'm feeling better and can manage life without it but then I get back on cause I realize I need them again.  I recently weaned my way off about 4 months ago and was feeling good but then all of the negative thoughts slowly kept coming back to me and I decided I wanted to get back on ssri's again.  I got my old bottle of sertraline and only took 25mg of one.  I was out later that night at a family event and ended up having the worst anxiety attack in the bathroom that I've had for a long time.  Couldn't think, couldn't concentrate, just felt empty and the days after I had the same feeling.  I work at a restaurant so I need to be able to at least pretend to be happy with the customers but I couldn't even do that.  I had a full bledged panic attack on the way home from work a few days ago where I was hyperventilating and crying and couldn't stop for a good 30 minutes.  Went and saw the doctor today and she recommended me to a psychiatrist.  Has anyone else had an experience like this with getting back into an ssri?  ",

I felt like going to college would give me a second chance at socializing with other people, since i have been alone for most of the past 4 years of my life. It began so good and i felt like i was living fulfilling live for the first time in such a long time. But bit by bit i began to drift away from the crowd. My friends who lived with me in dorms began to leave me out of hang outs and wouldn't bother to explain what the matter was with anything they were talking about. And no one began to take my word seriously. I felt like i was being treated like a child, because i always try to joke around other people. To be honest, that might have been the only reason people could tolerate me. Oneday, i was having a walk with some of my friends and it somehow the subject lead to one of my friend saying that i was unreliable. I know he meant it as a joke, but that stuck hard to me. I began to realize that no one would come ask for my opinion when it came to a serious matter. But they would rather always go to someone else. Even one of my close friends, who i have known for almost 11 years, tried his best to keep the subject away from me, even when the problem was a minor one. When i tried to ask him about it he responded to me as if nothing i could say would value much to him. He said it was private, but i knew i enough to see that he just didn't feel like i was reliable enough. I have tried all i can be seem reliable, to gain people's trust, but it seems like i am the same old depressing me. I know all i have been saying may sound weird, but this is how i feel 100%.  I didn't make this with the goal of it being a rant post. I just want to express how i feel.",

I've been getting these huge overwhelming fears about death. About me dying. If it's not that it's super paranoia. I'll come home and see something out of place or read too far into something that my husband says or doesn't say and my mind switches to he's cheating on me or someone is coming into my house when I'm gone. Or I flip out over the stupidest things. It's starting to become more than overwhelming... I need to start mediation or yoga or something.

I can feel myself clawing my way out but occasionally I get these extreme spikes in anxiety that last a while.\n\nSo today I had one. I ended up skipping one class because I had a hard spike of anxiety in the morning, not sure why. \n\nThen I felt better and ended up going to get some energy drinks and tbh I think maybe I drank too much of them. I drank 2 monsters over the past few hours. \n\n Now I feel pretty anxious and bored if that makes sense. I\u2019m on campus but I\u2019d rather be at home. At least there I can chill and zone out on the tv until this passes. Here if I try to distract myself I feel uncomfortable and like I should be productive. \n\nAlso whenever I feel anxious lately depending on the last time I got some sexual release I end up focusing so much on that whole thing. I end up looking at girls more and caring more about being single. Got out of a relationship recently, 3 months ago, and it\u2019s still bothering me from time to time. \n\nWhenever I feel like this I feel restless but bored, tired but energetic, like I should be doing something but I can\u2019t seem to do anything, and all of this makes me sad. I get self conscious and lonely. I used to have my ex to text in times like this and she\u2019d help me out, just say the things I need to hear and I\u2019d calm down. \n\nAnyone else feel like this? It\u2019s so frustrating to feel bored but unable to think straight enough to do anything about it. ",

            "selftext": "Hi. I'm a 23 year old Female and my anxiety is getting worse every year.\n\nI graduated college in Feb of 2018 and since then I haven't really done anything with my life. I had a job, but the owner ended up physically scratching me and bruised my arm, verbally abused me and other crazy things so I had to leave for my own sanity. Since then I've been terrified to get another job. (This was back in April 2018). \n\nI'm in the process of moving to another country so I have 6-8 months of open space where I'm not really.. doing anything and it's making me feel like shit. I've applied for about 10 jobs and 2 of them got back to me, but when they called my anxiety got the best of me, flashbacks of my job in April came rushing in and I told both places \"Thank you for the offer, but I already found an opportunity\" when in reality I haven't.   \nOne of them was sort of a dream job, so I even went out of my way to call back and ask if they could re-consider me for the interview. They never got back to me. \n\nSo, now I've applied for some more jobs but I'm terrified that my anxiety will get the best of me again and make me turn down interviews. I'm 23 and have no job, no friends, no driver's license and I'm doing nothing with my life. My days consist of staying in my room constantly. I do have a hobby (body painting) which keeps me busy sometimes, but I know deep down inside it's not healthy to be this way. \n\nI want to at least get my driver's license, but I'm so afraid of asking my mother to pay for it (obviously she has to because I have no source of income). I already went one time to a driver's ed course, but the man who was teaching me how to drive almost got me into a car accident which left me feeling scared. We bled $500 on that course and I never went back and we didn't get our money back.   \nI don't really know what I'm looking for with this post. Maybe someone can relate, maybe some kind words, words of advice? Idk. I just needed to let that off my chest.\n\nThanks for reading and I hope your days are better than mines",

My anxiety turns into depression when I sit still and right now I'm entirely stuck. A few weeks ago I started cutting for the first time in a year, so I convinced myself that running was basically just self-harm and started doing that and have been getting back in shape. It felt like it was working.\n\nToday I saw the friend and went from really high to really low and felt the depressive spiral. I coaxed myself out the door and went for my best run yet... then when I got home I cut myself again. I keep telling myself this is just a set-back but I'm feeling really worthless right now.",

It gets so bad sometimes that I want to just go live in a trailer in the woods and try to farm, or move to a third world country.\n\nIt's easy to just pass blame to corporations and others, but ultimately we are the ones that drive the economic engines through our demand for things. My friends and boyfriend call me a downer so I've given up even talking about this stuff with them. People make incremental changes like giving up some single use plastics, but ultimately no one seems to care about their impact on the world and poor people in other countries. Sometimes I give in to the delusions and go back to \"normal\", but then I read or watch something that reminds me how destructive my middle class lifestyle in America is",

More like confetti, but much smaller. In my head, I laughed about how my anxiety is gonna ruin my night because of this and shrugged it off.\n\nHere I am an hour later fantasizing and freaking out about how I must\u2018ve inhaled the plastic confetti because the sticker was relatively high up and they sprinkled on me, it feels like I can feel them in my airway all the way down to my lungs. And because I\u2018m a smoker (started cause I thought it helps with the anxiety 2 years ago, it used to calm me down but now im just addicted) those little hairs in my lungs that remove the occasional plastic confetti don\u2018t work properly. Makes perfect sense at the moment..\n\nNothing makes sense when I think about it but my thoughts always find a way to jump to worst case scenarios where I freak out about my physical health.\n\n- Remove dust? Inhaled it, gonna die.\n\n- Dishes? Soap goes through my skin into my bloodstream, gonna die.\n\n- Watching netflix? Permanent eye damage cause I looked into a bright box, not gonna die but lose my vision.\n\n- Elderly neighbor giving me a cookie for no reason except that she knows I love cookies? The situation where I greeted her without a huge smile 3 years ago appears. She might have been offended. It might have been poisoned. Start feeling symptoms. Gonna die.\n\n- DOING ABSOLUTELY NOTHING, JUST LAYING ON MY BED? A BARELY NOTICEABLE 1 SECOND LONG PAIN IN MY LEFT ARM? HEART ATTACK, GONNA DIE.\n\nI don\u2018t even know why I think this way except that my therapist told me I probably have CPTSD and that might cause it.\n\nI\u2018m starting with therapy at the moment but I\u2018m too scared to take meds because I might come to think it messes with my brain in an unhealthy way and I\u2018m scared of freaking out even more..\n\nI\u2018m so sorry if this post offends anyone I just had to let it out somewhere anonymously =(",
