But once in a while therapists will tell me something actually quite deep and meaningful. \n\nI talked to the psychologist about how I try to work in different places on my laptop, not just at my desk in my apartment. He said that not just with work, but with everything you want to do ... it's good to try and change up the scenery a bit. \n\n**He said that the longer you stay in your comfort zone, the smaller it can get.** I had never heard that before. That making the effort and fighting the fear to leave your comfort zone can actually help make your comfort zone bigger. he advised me to try and work in the lobby area of my building at one of the tables at least once a week.",

It's just that my symptoms and the things that cause me to be anxious coupled with the fact that my anxiety doesn't seem to be as severe as other people's causes me to feel unworthy and unheard. I've never had a panic attack before, and I know several people who with anxiety who have definitely had panic attacks and such. Mine has never gotten to that point. I kind of feel like I'm lost--I'm too anxious to function normally, but seemingly not anxious enough to feel like my anxiety is taken seriously by others. It kind of feels like if people don't see your anxiety physically, if you don't wear it on your sleeve, then you must not be struggling. Has anyone ever felt this way about their anxiety?

It just seems like during such times, everyone I know who has an otherwise positive and supportive worldview swaps those views out for pure cynicism and anyone who's typically cynical has their views backed up by the world around them basically going to madness. The whole ordeal is so draining that I'd feel like shit by the the end of the election regardless of whether or not I was even happy with the result. Worse still, it affects the whole world but I'm Irish so I can't do a damn thing about it.\n\nI know it's easy to say \"ignore social media and the news\" but I don't want to stay in the dark on serious issues in the world, either.\n\nI've been trying to take some positive steps in my life to be less anxious and angry towards life and I've improved a lot, I think. But with this election around the corner and the general political discussion being fueled by fear and anger, I feel like all my work is going to go to waste. \n\nI don't know if anyone can give me advice about this, but to be honest I'm just glad to vent about this. i know this might sound overdramatic but this whole thing honestly scares me.",

I know things get hectic sometimes, like you\u2019re on a ship that is getting more and more crowded, and you can feel yourself slowly drowning.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut you\u2019re ship will **not** sink.\n\nYou\u2019re too strong for that.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI know it may feel as if you\u2019re ship will give in, but our minds will not let it. As much stress and worrying overthinking causes us, where would we be without it? Just imagine if we didn\u2019t overthink things -- we could be in big trouble. For an obvious reason we should always consider the consequences of our actions -- the world would be complete and utter chaos if we did things without thinking them through.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEvery second of everyday we are faced with decisions. And every single decision we make we are only one step away from living an entirely different life.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShould we be afraid of that? No.\n\nWe should embrace it.\n\nWe should learn to love it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe are so incredibly lucky that one decision is all it takes to change the direction of your life -- we should never be unhappy with ourselves because we have control over everything we do. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut sadly, us overthinkers, fear that actualization. We spend most of our time worrying and stressing about the consequences of our actions that we never get to enjoy our choices.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDon\u2019t live in regret.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSincerely, \n\nYour fellow Overthinker",

            "selftext": "I\u2019m 28 years old and i have 2 kids. In the past year I\u2019ve been diagnosed with Postpartum Anxiety, Postpartum OCD, GAD, and health anxiety. I\u2019m an empath and highly sensitive person - I\u2019ve always had anxiety and depression (I mean since I was a teen), but that was nothing compared to now. The birth of my son brought on so much more anxiety and then with the birth of my daughter, it truly exploded. I started seeing my therapist in July 2018 after my GP recommended her. I started going every week, then every two weeks, then in February 2019 my therapist and I decided I can start going once a month! I wanted to share with everyone how I\u2019ve been dealing with my anxiety.\n\n\u2022 **Therapy.** Find a great therapist, or a doctor who will listen and help you find a great therapist. Please don\u2019t be afraid to mention your struggles to someone, even if you\u2019ve been previously let down by another health professional. Trust me, I\u2019ve had my fair share of doctors who blatantly ignored my symptoms. Please keep trying.\n\n\u2022 **Journaling.** If you\u2019re like me and you suck at journaling, I suggest checking Amazon for The Five Minute Journal. My therapist just recommended it to me. It has daily affirmations written in, weekly challenges, and the journal entries are done in the morning and at night so just keep it by your bed and you\u2019re good to go.\n\n\u2022 **Watch something comforting.** For me, it\u2019s Gilmore Girls and One Day at a Time.\n\n\u2022 **Boundaries.** Some of my anxiety stemmed from a lack of boundaries with my family and my therapist suggested that I read Stop Walking on Eggshells by Paul T Mason. It\u2019s on Amazon and it has really helped.\n\n\u2022 **Music. **Make a playlist, blast the music, and sing! My favorite band is Say Anything. The frontman is extremely open about his anxiety (and about having bipolar disorder, too). This reflects in his music/song writing and I find it comforting.\n\n\u2022 **Eating healthy.** I changed my diet to a whole food plant based diet to get my health under control since I have health anxiety. I feel so much better!\n\n\u2022 **A community.** I read a lot of posts on this and other subs. I don\u2019t really post a lot but just reading other people\u2019s posts, especially on here, makes me feel less alone in my anxiety.\n\n\u2022 **A weighted blanket**. I try to get enough sleep, but most nights I just can\u2019t. I have two young kids, so I usually get like 7 hours (that may sound like enough but, to be honest, I need like 10 hours to feel like I\u2019m functioning normally). But my weighted blanket helps a lot. It doesn\u2019t weigh much, only like 8 lbs but I just keep it on my upper body/arms and it helps me sleep well.\n\n\u2022 **Try to open up.** Some of my anxiety was from my husband and I having a disconnect because I shut people out. My therapist suggested The 5 Love Languages by Gary Chapman (also on Amazon). My husband and I both read it and highlighted what was important to us and realized we weren\u2019t showing each other love in the ways we needed it. This probably saved our marriage.\n\n\u2022 **Take space when you need it.** I\u2019m a stay at home mom, so by the end of the day I need a little bit of space. When my husband gets home, I put in my headphones and start cooking dinner by myself and he plays with the kids. I love cooking so much and it\u2019s relaxing to me, as is music, so this really helps me unwind a bit.\n\n\u2022 **Other lifestyle changes.** I quit caffeine for a while and no longer drink wine (I really only drank socially, but now I\u2019d rather not). Alcohol and caffeine were not good for my anxiety. I was drinking a lot of coffee so I needed to cut it out for a few months. Now I drink one cup a day.\n\n\u2022 **Self-help books.** The Worry Trick (on Amazon, surprise)! This book has been great for me and I even bought a copy and sent it to my sister. She\u2019s gotten further into it than I have and she tells me it\u2019s very helpful!\n\n\u2022 **The 90 Second Rule.** My therapist told me a while ago that our brains only feel emotions for 90 seconds at a time. If I feel bad for more than 90 seconds, it\u2019s because I\u2019m allowing myself to stay in that emotion. That has helped me so much. Now when something makes me anxious or angry or upset, I acknowledge it (sometimes in my head, sometimes aloud) and try to move on.\n\nI\u2019m sure a ton of people already do these things, but I just wanted to share what helps me. I hope this helps even 1 person feel a little bit better. I just want everyone to know that I still struggle. Sometimes I forget about the 90 seconds or I don\u2019t take space when I need it. I\u2019m still learning to manage my anxiety, but I\u2019m much better today than I was 9 months ago. I\u2019m sorry for the long post!",
