All summer we were drinking, partying and all of the fun teenager stuff. I became a really close friend with, let's call him, M. In August I've started having some mental problems after getting drunk, I was getting extremely sad about my life(I'm 20 yo, never had a girlfriend, almost never talked to girl and I've got a trouble in talking to people, I cannot find any good topic to talk) and the M was helping me to deal with that. Also we've got one girl in the crew, Ms gf, let's call her D. D was also helping me. And I fell in love with her. I'm not a d*ckhead and I sweard that I will never try to be with her because of my friendship with M. They both knew that I like her. And fast forward to 3 weeks ago. I've became friends with D. She written to me that M told her that he's unable to go to the 18th birthday party of Ds friend(He has some mental health problems, he takes some pills daily etc.). She wasn't happy about that, she was crying and really mad at him. I was helping her with that, I told her to not worry and go alone etc. At the same day as She was at this party, my friend called me to ask if I'm going outside today. I've joined the crew and there was M. Perfectly fine. I was furios. He saw that. We stayed alone right before our destination and began to argue. Or rather he began to almost cry when I was calm, just talking what's the matter. After listening to me He told me that D is insensitive and he wants to break up with her. After that M told me that he's breaking contact with whole crew and He went home. He was lying while fking time.\nI told D what he told me. Next day M told D that I was just trying to break their relationship. She believed him partially. When I wrote to her about that she told me that we're okay, that she ignored us both about that. And theres today. No one from the crew is contacting me, only like one snap daily. M and I are still on war path. D is just reacting to memes I keep sending her. I'm wandering around town half hour ago and I meet whole crew. She was the only one that didn't say hi to me. I'm still shaking.\nI just wanted to be her friend.\nI've never had a female friend.\nI'm not able to make new friends, I don't know how. I'm completely alone rn and have no one to talk. Why I'm always fcking everything up?\n\nSorry for any mistakes, I'm not natvie English speaker.\nHave a nice day guys.",

I WAS SO MAD AT HER! Instead of going after her I thought the healthy thing to do would be to go nuts on a completely anonymous site (not realizing I can actually hide behind annonymous). I didnt even think if she uses reddit or not... I cant help but feel like she stumbled one one of these posts and is super pissed at me now. The likelyhood of this is pretty low Im assuming. Sometimes I share funny stuff to fb though so Im sure if she were to click on that she would get a direct link to my raging rants. She hasnt said anything about it...

            "selftext": "Does anyone else get really anxious and depressed when they don't have anything specially to look forward to in the future? I have found that in my life, my mental health is an absolute wreck during times where I don't have much on the go. When I don't have anything specifically planned that I'll be doing in the future that I'm excited about, I will feel like I have nothing to look forward to in life and will have a really hard time trying to see the point of living. If I remember correctly, this mindset began in 8th grade. I was OBSESSED with this boy band and my whole world revolved around them. I wouldn't talk about anything else and literally not much else in my life mattered but this boy band. After being very obsessed with this band for about a year, watching their videos and listening to their music every waking second, my mom decided to buy me tickets to see this band live. She gave me these tickets a few months before the concert and I was so flippin excited I couldn't keep it contained. I had countdowns on my phone that told me exactly how many days, hours and minutes until that concert started and it pretty much consumed me (in a good way) until the concert passed. After the concert ended I remember feeling extremely depressed and I can remember just knowing I'd never feel that happy again. I felt that way for weeks and I swear I legitimately went through a period of real depression. I felt empty and hopeless and didn't see much point in the rest of my life, now that I had seen my favourite band I had officially done the best thing I could have possibly done at that time. I didn't see it ever being better than that so I was depressed by the concept that nothing would ever be that good again. That feeling slowly faded after a couple months, and I purchased tickets to another one of their concerts and went through that entire process all over again. And again. And again. I attended probably upwards of 20+ concerts while I was in highschool because every single time a concert would end I'd be depressed and would need something to look forward to again or my life felt hopeless and empty. \n\nFast forward a few years and I'm out of high school now. That band is still my favorite band and I still attend their concerts when they come close to my city, but I don't go to as many shows as I used to just because my obsession has subsided slightly and my anxiety has me unable to work these days, so I couldnt afford to go to as many as I used to even if I wanted to. But still, to this day, I find I am still the exact same way about constantly needing something to look forward to. I constantly talk about things I plan on doing in the following months and constantly trying to make plans for fun things ahead of time and when I have no upcoming plans that I can look forward to in the future, even just making plans for the evenings/next day that I can try to even slightly look forward to. I'll ask my boyfriend if he wants to watch a movie when we get home, or make plans to play a certain video game with him that evening, or even plan to just do something as simple as grocery shop the next day. For some reason, when I try to live in the moment and don't have future plans that I can look forward to and plan for, I get extremely depressed and for some reason really REALLY anxious about life. I don't know why but I get all these anxious feelings that I'm gonna die and stuff and I don't even know why. I don't understand this logic fully but I'm just wondering if anyone else feels like this ever and if anyone maybe has a better understanding of these feelings than I do??",

I'm on Thanksgiving break, and life is pretty good. For some reason however there is a sense of dread in my mind. Like I'm dreading *something* but I don't know what that something is. This happens fairly often and it seems like the only way I can get myself to relax is by taking a sedative. It's like my body is always in \"go\" mode.

I have never worked full time for more than a few months due to going away to school and during school would never work more than a part-time job. This is when my work anxiety started I think. I had two jobs since September that I have quit because it gave me too much anxiety to go to work. \n\nGiven the jobs where customer service jobs and had high stress atmospheres at times. But I have always worked in retail and it has never bothered me until recently. \n\nNow one job number 3 in since September. If I am scheduled an 8 hour shift or more, I get so anxious about it that I lose sleep over it the night before and feel physically Ill before I go to work. Sometimes it gets better once I get to work other times it causes me to call off or leave early. I will have anxiety over stupid irrational things that I know are no big deal or that won\u2019t happen (I.e. making mistakes, being yelled by boss or customers, or being too busy). Even though I know I can handle these things it still causes me so much stress. I\u2019m afraid that it\u2019s not the jobs I\u2019m picking that are causing me anxiety, but it\u2019s me at this point. I fear that my anxiety will cause me to lose another job and I will have trouble keeping a job or be miserable for the rest of my life. \n\nReddit has always been a kind community that has given me solid advice in the past. I am wondering if anyone has had the same problem or has any helpful advice I could try. Thanks for reading.",

            "selftext": "Earlier today my girls were playing in the front yard and a salesman approached my yard from the street. He tried to talk to my mother in law first, but she shut him down. He accused her of not helping a man trying to provide for his two young daughters and not talking to him because he's a black man with dreadlocks.\n\nThen he turns to me and asks if I want a brochure. The adrenaline starts. I hate confrontation, and I'm a doormat. I say no thank you. I'm not looking to buy anything today. He pushed. I stand firm. No thank you. Not today. He starts asking if I'm afraid of him. No, I just don't want to buy anything. Holidays and all. He's close to my yard now. Do I not like him because he's a black man with dreadlocks? No, I have no problem with him, I just don't want to buy anything. I wish him a good holiday season though. He calls me racist and says maybe when he gets back I'll decide to have a heart and he hopes I'm not so cold to my husband, if I even have one. I can hear my heart in my ears. My flight response was kicking in, but I couldn't run. My girls were playing.\n\nHe finally moves onto our also white neighbors and catches the husband outside. The husband is also kind but firm and listens for a moment before turning the salesman down. The salesman is still yelling at me that see, not all white people are racist and I could learn how to not be heartless from my neighbor. I went inside to get my dogs. They would never attack anyone, but they bark all the damn time. Hopefully they would deter him if he wanted to keep being a jerk. He found an interested customer at the house across the street and I could still hear him shit talking me.\n\nI still feel on edge. He's gone, but I feel so shaken and on edge. I've taken my medication, but I can't shake the panic. I can't focus on anything, and the adrenaline is still there. He never came back, but I still feel like hiding. I don't know why I'm typing this out and putting it here. I just have to get it out. I feel like I might throw up.",

The first half is rather shallow i admit but it is quite nice to try to convince myself that I am pretty because I\u2019ve felt the opposite for so long due to a strange friendship and my nagging thoughts tearing me down. Being pretty isn\u2019t much important in reality I should realize. I haven\u2019t written ANYTHING in ages to, i dropped out of high school 3 years ago and I just haven\u2019t had the motivation to but I did tonight and my mind feels so empty in the most calming way. Towards the end I started writing in the 3rd person and that felt really nice , I heard somewhere that is a way of disassociating . Talking to yourself in the 3rd person. It helps during an anxiety attack cause it takes effort but while I was writing it felt so natural.       If you took the time to open this post, thank you and enjoy the rest of your browsing on reddit :)",

You can't just opt NOT to have internet access. You need it for basic things nowadays.\n\nBut I get worried about internet safety and internet stalkers so much. I just don't trust everything being online. I never liked putting my data online or having my info on internet databases - I won't even put photos online - but you have to nowadays. You just hope that the companies don't get breached.\n\nI tried to avoid having an email for so long but it seems impossible. I can't even go to college without an email.",
