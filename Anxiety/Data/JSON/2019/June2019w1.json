It usually works for a bit and then I have to do it again a few minutes later. I was not conscious that I did this until I moved to Korea and got scolded for doing this. Not doing it is almost unbearable physiologically though - I feel like I have to do it to release the sensation in my chest and stomach. Am I the only one?",

            "selftext": "Ironically today has been one of my happier days. I felt calm, happy and energised. I could take over the world. \n\n All of a sudden lady walking ahead of me collapses. No no no this isnt happenig. Me and two other women jump to her rescue. She's not responding, she can't hear us. \n\nAmbulance called by one of the ladies. Telling them the situation. Her voice is breaking. \"Come quick, come quick\" she says.\n\nWe put her down on the ground, in recovery position. We check breathing. It's okay. We hold her head. It will be fine.\n\nI ask \"can you hear me? Are you okay?\". Within minutes her lips are going blue. Is this how quick it happens? Is that all it takes? \n\nWe check her bag. Maybe she has an epilepsy band, maybe she needs some insulin, this is not her dying.  \n\nShe makes a sudden gasping noise. She's okay she's okay. Not responsive. We check her pulse again, there's nothing there.  \n\nI lean down, is she breathing through her nose?  She's not. She's not breathing. It's okay it's okay. Do not panic. Remember how they taught you CPR in school. One hand over the other. \n\nCall the ambulance again. I don't know how long it has passed, maybe 5 minutes or so. It's too long. Why is it taking so long? Please hurry up. \n\nHer skin is going purple.  Am I seeing this right? Why is it so cold to touch? Her lips are blue. This is it. The CPR continues. One of the ladies is screaming down the street \"DOCTOR WE NEED A DOCTOR\"\n\nFunny how in moments like these, a minute feels like an eternity. Where is the ambulance? We call again. 14 minutes have passed. Why isn't it here? She's gone by now. \n\nWhy couldn't I have done more? The ambulance comes. It's not as fast as in the movies, I want to scream at them. GET HER IN. HELP HER. \n\nI need to walk away now. I can feel my heart beating out my ribcage. Why is life so fragile? I ask myself. It feels surreal, I feel zoned out. One second she was walking in front of me, the next she was gone. \n\nValue your life. Value your loved ones. Value the good and bad days.  No matter how hard it gets, we should all be grateful that we get to live through it and grow from it. Sometimes someone, anyone, can get taken away at any time. Make yourself happy and make others around you happier. Be kind. \n\nRIP.",

Needless to say, I had been stressing before this interview. \n\nI had been wanting to work at this place for as long as I can remember, being that I love video games and all things surrounding them as a whole. \n\nThe man interviewing me and I were getting along great, even after he made me wait an hour for him to finish a conference call beforehand. I even helped a child pick a couple games to buy before the actual interview. (Probably should have mentioned that to him during the interview, in hindsight)\n\nAnyway, I got flabbergasted and scatterbrained due to the fact that the man interviewing me kept asking me questions about sales and marketing. Then...I just broke down. \n\nMy anxiety got the better of me and I told him how badly I have been trying to get a job, how close I've gotten only to have the proposed job slip through my fingers last minute.... How I'm nearing 30 and am still living with my parents, don't have a job, have crippling depression, anxiety, etc. Basically, spilled my guts to him... \nHe wasn't very sympathetic but, in his defense, I was being interviewed and straight up lost my cool in the middle of it. \n\nNow, I'm terrified that I blew the opportunity just because my anxiety got the better of me.\n\nTL ; DR: TIFU because my anxiety of not being able to get a job for the longest time led me to spill my guts and cry during an interview.",

            "selftext": "Hi all, just wanted to share some tips I have recently been learning that have really helped my anxiety and OCD. \n\n1. Structure of schedule. For most people with anxiety, having a strict schedule and knowing what you are doing helps you feel more in control. I'm on summer break from college and recently started working full time and it doesnt allow me to be anxious. I'm occupied.\n\n2. Be active. Whether that means working out and running, or just fishing and going out with friends, be active and get some sort of exercise. \n\n3. Avoid universal triggers. Too many screens. Laziness. Popular news media that always is reporting negatives. Avoid em. \n\n4. EAT HEALTHY!!! This one is so important. Having a diet that is very healthy helps tremendously. I've done whole plant based diets plus fish and chicken with organic and fresh produce and I've never felt more energetic and stress free before in my life. I highly reccomend looking into how diet affects mood and mental health. What goes in comes out\n\nAlso, never be ashamed or anxious about taking the medicine your doctor prescribed you.\n\nHope this helps and let me know of any of more tips you guys have!",

            "selftext": "long time lurker, first time poster. cw: brief mentions of trauma \n\ni\u2019ve been feeling like this for the last several weeks in particular but it\u2019s been an on-again off-again feeling for me for years. it\u2019s spring term my senior year of college and i think i\u2019ve wasted most of it. i had an experience earlier in the term that was traumatic for me (i wasn\u2019t assaulted, no death in the family or anything like that, just a very weird set of circumstances in a situation i was put in that made me extremely uncomfortable and anxious). it fucked me up a lot and brought back a lot of the worst parts of my anxiety.\n\ni was so anxious i missed countless hours of work, class, social events, etc. i spent nearly every day wasting time and being upset, taking baths for 3+ hours while browsing reddit, sleeping until 1 or 2 in the afternoon, staying up until 4 or 5 a.m. for no reason, eating like shit. i set my own work hours so my boss wasn\u2019t upset with me for being gone, and i talked to the professors whose classes i missed and they said they understood i was struggling in my personal life / mental health and my absences would not have any impact on my grade in the course. but i still feel awful.\n\ni wanted this term to be my term - end of four years of hard work, sunny weather, lightest class load i\u2019ve ever taken before with lots of fun classes. but it hasn\u2019t been, not at all. i hate how often i flaked out on social / extracurricular events because i just didn\u2019t have the energy after a day of my anxiety exhausting me. i hate how i missed the majority of class sessions in one of my classes. i at least wanted to come to the last class session this morning after missing almost a straight month of class, but i couldn\u2019t even do that this morning because i forgot to refill my antidepressant prescription and kept waking up last night because of anxiety nightmares (a common withdrawal symptom for me), not to mention i can barely function when i\u2019m feeling withdrawal symptoms from medication so i would have been in a hazy, anxious mental state even if i had gone to class this morning. i still think i should have gone though, maybe i would feel a little less worthless today. i hate how much late work i\u2019ve turned in, even if my professor in my other class has said it won\u2019t impact my grade. i even missed a class trip so i could go home and be with my parents on the weekend instead, which i think was ultimately better for everyone involved, but i wish i had never had this massive anxiety attack in the first place because then i could have gone. i could have done a lot of things.\n\noverall i\u2019m just sad and bitter that anxiety yet again threw a massive wrench in my plans when i actually felt like my life was coming together. i lost out on all opportunities to attend fun classes, to enjoy working the job that i love, to do fun things with friends, to make the most of my last term in the extracurricular groups i\u2019m in on campus. i wish anxiety before this massive anxiety attack hadn\u2019t hindered me in similar ways at random intervals throughout my time in college. it hasn\u2019t all been bad, but it\u2019s been so much worse than i was ever expecting and not even close to how i thought this term would go. i don\u2019t understand what i did to deserve this happening, and i know that isn\u2019t a fair or accurate way of thinking, but i still feel that way a lot. i wish i could just live a normal life and end my college years having fun like everyone else.\n\ni know logically none of this is fair, because wishing away a mental illness i can\u2019t get rid of isn\u2019t helpful, nor is wanting to change a past i can\u2019t change. but it\u2019s hard to remind myself of that when i feel like without anxiety most of the bad things in my life would never have happened.\n\ni have a supportive family, therapy, and medication which helps, but i nonetheless still have a lot of self hatred, bitterness and regret too. i know logically it won\u2019t be like this forever but remembering that is difficult in the moment, and yelling my frustrations into the digital void is my current preferred coping method until i get my prescription refilled later this afternoon. \n\nin any case, thanks for reading all this if you\u2019ve made it this far, and thank you all for your willingness to be vulnerable and share your struggles as well. every single one of your posts makes me feel like i\u2019m not alone in this fight, and that means more to me than i can express. love and healing to you all. &lt;3",
