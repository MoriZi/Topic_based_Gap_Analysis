I think I have a better grip on how I can deal with the symptoms , but every time they happen I always feel like i\u2019m going to puke or i\u2019m seriously sick. can anyone else relate to this? \nI know a lot of people get used to their symptoms and are able to just breath through it, but I find that extremely hard because I struggle to differentiate anxiety symptoms for being seriously sick. \n\n(wow I used the word symptoms a lot. I didn\u2019t know a synonym for it sorry lol) ",

Even with people who've said that I'm their best friend and they appreciate having me in their life so much, I still worry to no end. \"Did they get an impression that is not accurate to what I meant and me trying to explain myself only causes distrust?\" \"Did I step over a line all of a sudden and they will remember this forever?\"\n\nIt has ruined friendships as I often resort to seeking validation over and over when this happens, and I am hellbent on not doing it again, but how do I maintain my calm when all my brain wants to do is jump to conclusions about how I will be abandoned or that I've crossed a line I didn't mean to and caused permanent damage on our relationship?\n\nI'm trying to remind myself that the friends I've chosen are reasonable people and won't get distraught over small stuff when they know I often put my foot in my mouth, and that a close friendship doesn't break over a day. Yet I still have this constant pit in my stomache.\n\nAnd talking about it with them usually makes it worse, as I've always felt like an annoying burden when exposing my vulnerabilities to people out of the blue.",

            "selftext": "Hello! Just wondering what people think of this situation and how I should respond to him next time. I (26M) have been going to therapy for four years for both anxiety and depression. I feel like I have a pretty good handle on it for the most part, but sometimes my catastrophizing gets a bit out of hand. \n\nI am in a long distance relationship with my fianc\u00e9 who is finishing his masters in another faraway state. We will be moving in together in several months. The other day he took around 7 hours to respond to one of my texts and I told him it would be nice if he didn\u2019t ignore me all day, which was a snarky comment on my part, I know. He got mad that I was accusing him of ignoring him and he said he was busy. I apologized.\n\nThe next day I told him I\u2019ve been having severe anxiety about the future, and his response was less than kind. I told him I was struggling with putting things into perspective about when we\u2019d see each other next etc. even though it\u2019s not a long while.\n\nHe told me he hates when I \u201cget like this\u201d when I have \u201cirrational thoughts\u201d. I was really angry because that\u2019s what anxiety is. It\u2019s not like I was accusing him of something crazy. Anyway, I basically told him I was sorry he was frustrated, and all I can do is try to be better, but that this is what anxiety is for me sometimes. I\u2019m not trying to explain away bad behavior as I did take accountability. I just feel like he was kind of insensitive and this isn\u2019t the first time. It makes me feel like a batsh*t crazy person. How should I respond next time? \n\nTLDR: Fianc\u00e9 was insensitive. Did I respond correctly? ",

            "selftext": "The first time a doctor suggested I talk to a counselor was my second year of college. She also prescribed an antidepressant, which I took, but I never went to a counselling. The meds didn't make me feel happy, but they made me feel nothing, which at the time, was better than overwhelming sadness. Eventually things in my life changed/settled down and I felt better and was able to stop taking the meds and feel good without them.   \n\n\nThe last few years a lot has happened in my life that has been and continues to be very difficult to deal with. I have seen doctors a few times for anxiety and depression, tried antidepressants again and hated them, but never could get myself to schedule that counselor. I don't know why. If someone else had set me an appointment, I would have gone and probably been better for it, but for some reason, I just couldn't make myself do it or ask for the specific help I needed.   \n\n\nWell today, I had to leave my day job early because the stress has really been weighing on me, and it is catching up with me physically in various ways. When I got home, I took out the business card I've been carrying around for a couple of months and sent in a request for a new patient appointment online. I got a call back later and let it go to voicemail. My first instinct was to wait until tomorrow to call back, but I pushed through and made the call.  \n\n\nMy appointment isn't for three weeks, but I am hopeful that it will help. The circumstances that cause the most stress in my life are not going to change anytime soon, but the attempts I've made to manage my stress and anxiety on my own are clearly not enough. I don't know what I'm looking for by sharing this; I just wanted to tell someone. Encouragement is appreciated, and if you have advice for someone who has never been to counseling, that is also welcome.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThanks for reading.",

I\u2019ve had pretty crippling anxiety my whole life and just got prescribed Wellbutrin(was on Citalopram for 5 years but hated how it took away my sex drive, and I\u2019ve been med free for a year now). Its currently day 4 on Wellbutrin and I don\u2019t know what the HECK is going on. It\u2019s like my anxiety is WAY worse and amplified in my mind, but my body doesn\u2019t feel the symptoms nearly as much. I literally think about my anxiety nonstop now whereas before I was at least able to turn it off sometimes and had more control. I feel like I\u2019m trapped in a box, it\u2019s insane. \nI was I know you\u2019re supposed to wait it out and see how your body reacts after at lest a month, but I can\u2019t handle keeping this up if this is how it\u2019s going to be. Getting back on medication I was at the end of my rope, so now I\u2019m REALLY just in dire need of ditching what won\u2019t work and figuring out what will. \nAnyone have experiences with Wellbutrin used strictly for anxiety? I\u2019m losing my mind here. ",

So basically, I work as a hostess at some bar. While at work, my boyfriend texted me that water is not running at home due to some pipe problems, and that\u2019s how it started. I was panicking, cant think straight. Then two of my close friends came to my work yesterday, my boss (who\u2019s the owner and the bartender) hooked them up with a drink each, and I went to the kitchen to hook them up with free appetizers. It\u2019s my first time to invite friends to come over to where I work, so I thought it was all cool when I hooked them up of free food. One of the servers saw it and she called me out. And she ended up talking to my boss about it. So my boss talked to me and he said the food has to be paid. And I was like ok. My coworker was rude to them too, giving them dirty looks and bad vibes in general and it was so embarassing, it made my friends really uncomfortable. Now here\u2019s what\u2019s making me anxious, I saw them looking at me and talking, and I like that job, and Im worried that it might affect my relationship with my bosses, since there are very good to me. This kept me up since last night. ",

However when I'm alone I overthink every little thing about it and get myself really worked up. I seem to talk myself into the fact that one day he is going to get bored of me and leave. I'm anxious about where it is heading and getting my heart broken, anxious about being strung along, anxious if he is busy for the night I think it means he isn't interested anymore snd I can't relax until I see him again. It is taking away from the enjoyment of it and I fear will ultimately ruin the relationship. Does anyone have any tips on how to deal with these thoughts? ",

Don\u2019t get me wrong, I am.\n\nBut I am also unendingly anxious about it. It feels like I\u2019ve been going through waves of just intense panic about it. \n\nAnd I\u2019ve finally gotten over that. Now I\u2019m excited to go, but my anxiety has shifted to other places. I\u2019ve been experiencing some soreness under my arms and now I\u2019m terrified I have cancer. That I\u2019m dying. I\u2019m making plans to go see a doctor before I leave but what if they end up finding something? \n\nI also recently made another big leap of faith and THAT has had me a mess too. Even though now it\u2019s something that\u2019s out of my hands. \n\nEvery day I remind myself that I need to take it one day at a time and that everything is fine and I\u2019m about to embark on this incredible journey. But then my anxiety just flares back up and overtakes me. \n\nI\u2019m exhausted. I\u2019m stressed. I\u2019m sad. I\u2019ve cried several times in the past two weeks over nothing and everything. I\u2019ve had almost no appetite and I\u2019ve been forcing myself to eat. \n\nI feel like I can\u2019t tell anyone about this because they\u2019re just so excited for me. Everyone I\u2019d normally confide in is just so happy for me and proud and I don\u2019t want to let them down. I don\u2019t want to throw this all away. What should I do?\n\nThanks for reading this. Any advice, encourage or anything is very much appreciated. Please tell me I\u2019m going to be ok. ",

            "selftext": "I have had anxiety all my life, but in 2013 I was finally diagnosed. I was in a really bad rough patch with my mental health, and I had all the basic emotional symptoms of anxiety; feelings of doom, crying, worrying, nightmares, attacks ect.   \n\n\nOver the years it has gotten so much better, but this past year I notice my anxiety is coming back, but this time it's not actively emotional. I'm still nervous, and emotional, and kinda OCD about some things. But the worst thing that is happening, is that my body has all these fun new physical symptoms. I know you should never google a symptom, but all the one's I do always lead back to anxiety.   \n\n\nI was wondering if anyone else gets weird physical symptoms too and how they deal with it?\n\nFor example, when I go to bed and lie down in my nice duvet, for the first hour it feels like my skin on fire, it itches and burns. It doesn't matter what I'm wearing, if I did, or did not shower, or if I have cream on. I also get headaches about every 3 weeks that last for days, they are throbbing and right at my temples and it makes me so frustrated because I can't seem to treat or prevent them. Another symptom, and the worst, is the butterflies. It's like my tummy is always tying itself in knots. Butterflies as soon a wake up, and when I go to bed, and all day. Of course they get worse when I am actually stressed, but the butterflies are always there. They can prevent me from eating, or sleeping, and sometimes they become so bad they cause bathroom issues. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTLDR. Why did my anxiety turn from purely emotional thing to having only the physical symptoms? ",

            "selftext": "For the past few weeks, I have been having horrible panic attacks/anxiety episodes. I feel like I can\u2019t breathe, my throat closes up and I get super hot and sweaty. The worst part is I feel super nauseous, and that these always tend to happen in situations where I can\u2019t really leave easily like my college classes. As a result, a lot of the advice on here like lay down, listen to music or do something else to distract you don\u2019t work for me because I\u2019m in the middle of class, or the middle of a movie theater. It\u2019s happened twice in this class where I just have to get up after about 30 minutes and miss the majority of the class to run out of the room. It\u2019s an auditorium style lecture hall so I can\u2019t quietly go out the back, everyone sees me leave to go to the bathroom to try to calm down, to ultimately needing to leave again because I panic again after trying to calm down in the bathroom. It happened to me in another class where I gave a presentation. During this \u201cpresentation\u201d I didn\u2019t even have to say a word, just stand there for 10 minutes while two other members spoke. I have done so many presentations before where I have had to speak, and although it\u2019s not my favorite thing, I\u2019ve never had a reaction like this. It was the longest ten minutes just standing up there feeling like I was going to throw up, like I just NEEDED to run out of there. I stood my ground but as soon as my group finished I left to go to the bathroom to calm down. Watched another group present, feeling anxious the entire time still. When they were done I left for the bathroom again, only to force myself to return. It\u2019s my last semester of college, my classes are important and interesting to me and I don\u2019t want to miss them. I\u2019m dealing with a lot of stress lately with job searching, relationship issues and just general depression for negative self image and fear for the future. I have been seeing a counselor at my university for the past few months and although I\u2019ve been anxious before I\u2019ve never had so many attacks like this, almost every other day. They happen in the worst times, never when I\u2019m just home alone or not doing anything. I don\u2019t know what to do. As soon as I leave the class, the panicked feeling is pretty much gone, but I cannot keep running out of my classes and I don\u2019t want to get so afraid of anxiety that I stop going altogether.",

And for some reason Iv started to have relationship anxiety I feel like he\u2019s going to leave me eventually this inner voice tells me I\u2019m not good enough, I\u2019m ugly, I\u2019m boring. That he will find better. \n\nI think this stemmed from his ADHD and Aspergers, I started reading about how it effects relationships, I started reading Reddit posts and I started to see people posting a lot saying that they easily get bored. \nAfter I saw lots of people saying that it started all the negative words in my head of how he\u2019s going to get board of me and leave me. \n\nIt started with that and has just snowballed out of control Iv started acting obsessive, clingy, Iv taken it out on my boyfriend and I also act controlling. And I\u2019m sick of it I feel like I\u2019m losing my mind I feel like a looney toon. I thought I was fine but I guess not we had a argument the other day and it was all my fault because of my anxiety. \n\nI feel like if I don\u2019t keep in contact with him every day he will eventually lose interest in me. And that\u2019s where my obsession comes to play because I will constantly be wanting to know what he\u2019s doing I would want to call him and speak to him 24/7 and if I don\u2019t I think of the worse. it\u2019s not that I don\u2019t trust him it\u2019s just my anxiety is talking negative things to me. \n\nThis whole year so far Iv been trying soooo hard to exercise and stay fit physically and mentally but mentally it\u2019s a bit harder. This week I feel like it\u2019s all coming back the negative thoughts and the arguments over my anxiety. I just need help I don\u2019t want to lose him. Also he doesn\u2019t know about my anxiety and I don\u2019t know how to tell him either I get scared talking about it. \n\nI messaged him today and sent him a big apology on how Iv been acting and told him I\u2019m going to give him space I need to evaluate my self. This is a big step for me I want to change because I don\u2019t want to lose him. \n\nIv started looking at anxiety massages and I\u2019m going to get out and start doing things that I enjoy I just need tips and help please :)\n\n\n\n\n\n",

This means I have to do a lot of interviews and actually going up to people and asking questions. This is...really hard for my social anxiety.\n\nBut today I went to the interview I set up and asked all my questions and got the information I needed. I even knocked on the door to make him aware I was ready for the interview when he was ready, and that is something I have never been able to do before.\n\nIt feel good to know I can actually talk to people I don't know and get what I need to done.",

Yesterday I went to the nurse having a panic attack and she sent me to my counselor. My counselor wasn\u2019t there so I went back and I asked if I could just go and she asked if I wanted to lie down on the bed in the back. When I\u2019m anxious I cannot sit still so when she said that I started panicking even more and just got in my car and left. I was marked truant in a class because of this. And when I got home my mom was upset at me for leaving school without going through the nurse, but I just couldn\u2019t deal with it and left. I feel like my parents are starting to think my anxiety is just an excuse. They say, there\u2019s nothing to be anxious about so what\u2019s wrong? I just get extremely frustrated and I don\u2019t know what to do and end up spending the day in my room. I hate this, on days when I stay at school I\u2019m so burned out by the time I get home that I don\u2019t want to do anything and start feeling suicidal, although I think that\u2019s because of my new medication that\u2019s not doing shit for my anxiety.",
