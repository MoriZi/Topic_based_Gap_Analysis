I ate a really bad combo of food so maybe that cause the palpitation(bc the palp happened about 15 minutes after eating what I ate)? I was literally just in my room sitting down when just randomly I thought my heart was stopping it was the scariest feeling ever. Three months later and all i\u2019ve done is pile up symptoms, at first it was just palpitations then it evolved to palpitations and muscle twitches, then muscle twitches, restlessness, headaches, chest tightness, muscle tension, stiff neck, constantly aware of my heartbeat, numbness in arm(this has stopped for the most part), really sensitive to light, digestive issues and always gassy 24/7, and feeling like my insides are shaking sometimes. I\u2019ve been to the er multiple times and had blood test multiple times all coming back finding nothing. I took anxiety medicine hydroxyzine and it helped in the slightest but for the most part just made me sleepy. Now I just take medicine before bed to help me sleep and I still get no more than 5 hours of sleep. I haven\u2019t felt normal in so long and I\u2019m more frustrated than anything I just wanna be myself again.",

            "selftext": "Hi my fellow friends, I wanted to ask for some advice. \n\nI recently started this job in September and I got sick for two weeks after my first week. I was hella sad about it since it was such as sweet job and thought they might let me go. After being discharged from the hospital I let them know that I was back home. My manager reached out to me to make a schedule accommodation (going from full-time to part-time) which I was super excited about till I got back on my feet. I started the job again and this were hard for me since I was dealing with a new diagnosis (crohns disease) and having stomach ulcers. However before starting this job I have had crippling anxiety since my high school days (10+ yrs now ) and haven\u2019t dealt with it, I get really bad stomach aches and panic attacks that feel like hot flashes I\u2019m only 26. \nMy company was having a holiday party that I was going to with a plus one but when I went to work that day I had a full blown anxiety attack and left work. I\u2019ve been really embarrassed every since ( just last Tuesday) plus I\u2019m really shy but people have told me in the past that I come off distant. It\u2019s hard to translate my anxiety to people without feeling like I\u2019m over sharing. \n\nSo guys I\u2019m need you help, should I tell my boss that I have generalized anxiety and that\u2019s just who I am ! Or leave it alone. \nYou help would be greatlyyyyy appreciated",

            "selftext": "I've had anxiety for a long time but I never talked to anyone because I felt like I was faking it, but when I was tested for autism I was diagnosed with it. When I try to talk to people, they either try to find a silver lining or I can tell they are uncomfortable. Neither of my parents help me with this and my mom doesn't always like the idea of me talking to my school counselor even though I only meet with my therapist once a week and she sometimes cancels. My brother believes that mental illness is a choice and my sister doesn\u2019t talk to me. The only person who will let me talk about mental illness is my other sister but she suffers from multiple things and I feel guilty for dumping my problems on to her. She suffers from a few EDs and she recently relapsed and is planning on going to a rehab center out of state meaning I won\u2019t be able to see or talk to her. I feel like I\u2019m trapped behind a glass wall unable to communicate with others and I feel like I\u2019m making my family and friends lives worse but killing myself would make everyone\u2019s lives even worse meaning I\u2019m stuck in this loop of making myself feel terrible. I wish I could openly talk about my horrible anxiety and how no treatment is working but the only person I feel like I can talk to is going away. I just need a hug.",

            "selftext": "I'm a 23y.o girl, since middle school I like to imagine these scripts in my head, creating a drama or movie on my own. Part of it maybe because I'm too imaginative  and part of it because I was just bored. But whenever the script turns to the worst moments, I tend to have this crying fits to the point that I'm having trouble breathing. It never last more than 15 minutes. And since after crying I feel like weights being lift off my shoulder, I kinda make it a habit of mine to cry my eye out at least once a week.\n\nTo this day, I still have this habit. But these past few weeks I think I had my first panic attack. Things happen in my university and out of stress I cried in front of my friends. They managed to calm me down and the crying stops eventually.\n\nBut when I came home, before bed I can't help but rethink about the cause that made me cried earlier. And that was when I know something feel different than my usual crying fit. I can't breath, I feel dizzy, I can feel numbness or tingling sensation on my face, my hands were trembling and feel cold. My room was a bit far from my parents so they didn't hear my ugly crying noise. Not that I want them to find out their daughter might have a mental health issue either so I don't bother reach out to anyone. I can't calm myself down so I search those asmr panic attack comfort videos in YouTube and it helped.\n\nI had the same panic attack kind of moment yesterday but a mini one and the trigger is more like the same like the last one. I know how serious it is to have a mental health disorder and I'm not belittling those who have it. I'm just curious that maybe my way on how to cope with stress by crying my eyes out might create a situation that mimics a panic attack. Am I on the verge of having a panic disorder? Or am I just overreacting? Should I be wary of future possible panic attacks?",

            "selftext": "I (16M) had dealt with really bad anxiety since 8th grade, and have suddenly experienced a really major flare up not unlike how I was before I went to therapy. For about the last 2 months I could barely sleep because my mind won't shut down, and if I did sleep it was a very bad sleep/full of nightmares. I have very bad intrusive thoughts that won't give me rest, and as a result I can barely function with things like cooking myself food (something I really love doing) and brushing my teeth, let alone school work and classes.\n\nSince this flare up, I have also experienced a very sharp decline in my physical fitness. Twice a week since july I do krav maga, and ever since the flare up I could barely do the first 20 minutes of the workout, and then couldn't keep going, I go extremely pale and can't balance, and I feel like I'm going to pass out, so I wanted to ask, are these somehow connected?\n\nI've been constantly asking my parents for another appointment with my psychiatrist, both because I can barely function and also because I have been really suicidal, but my mom only now started making the appointment and the psychiatrist is too busy to even see the message.\n\nI want to ask her about being an outpatient until this thing calms down because I don't want to risk another attempt but until then I at least want to know if this is connected and if so how to bring this up to my mom because I've been essentially lying about/avoiding this topic ever since the flare up and she isn't the most patient of people.\n\nTl ; dr I've been experiencing very bad anxiety symptoms again and I think it has taken a toll on my physical health as well, but I want to be sure.\n\nThank you for reading and sorry for bad english.",

I don't feel special, I just haven't met anyone who thinks like me. My mind feels so deep, as if there's so much . As if I remember everything. Of course there's to much so it's all just a blur. Pinpoint a memory and I see as if I was there again. People talk as if was their first time mention something, where I remember. Not necessarily the words, but the emotions. It's just a feeling. There isn't words. There isn't really emotions. It's just something unknown, all i want is to be happy. Not struggle and suffer. If am already taking 10 pills a day, I should be feeling a lot better I think . I don't believe in a lot . I believe in facts though.. I see medication that can help, mentally and physically i am fractured. I'm fixing things up, and getting the wheels in motion , Im stuck in the mud but I'm further down the road than I was two months ago. Its just now I need to get back on track.

Ever since, but especially tonight I've been thinking about cutting myself with it. At the peak of a big depression a few years ago I harmed myself, but it hasn't been a recurring thing for me. I don't feel suicidal, I just really feel the urge to cut myself. I feel too ashamed to say it to anyone in my personal life, but i feel like if i dont say it to anyone i might actually do it. This page is the only  place that came to mind that i feel comfortable sharing this.",

            "selftext": "I've had anxiety all my life and never knew why until I googled my symptoms and it turns out I have Agoraphobia. A fear of being stuck in a situation, having a panic attack, and not being able to escape. It strike at the most annoying time and for the dumbest reasons. Today I ordered a drink at Starbucks and started to feel the panic setting in as I was waiting for my drink. I felt trapped cuz I couldn't leave until I got my drink and there was a lot of people around. Then the 20min drove home was almost the exact same. I felt trapped in my car, in traffic, the rain made it worse somehow.\n\nI know I'm fine and I try to take deep breaths, but it doesn't really help all that much. I still feel my heart speed up, my throat get tight, and my body get antsy. It usually hits me without warning. One second I'm fine standing in line at the store the next I wanna push everyone out of my way and take off running.\n\nDoes anyone else deal with this? If so what are something's you do to help when it hits? I've tried meditation and it helps somewhat so I think I'll give that a go again, but any help would be greatly appreciated. Thanks",

            "selftext": "For context, I'm 21 and live in the United States.\n\nI dropped out of college a couple years ago due to depression, anxiety, lots of shit due to a bad break-up. I've been trying to piece my life together again, but I've been struggling. Took a class at a local community college, then decided to try to look for a basic job. Fast food, retail, whatever, just something to make some money.\n\nI have applied to so many jobs and have gotten nothing in return. The closest I got was when I applied to Fry's (a popular grocery store). I managed to pass the phone interview by writing down my thoughts on paper beforehand. The phone interviewer said to call the store and tell them I passed the phone interview and I needed to schedule the in-person interview by asking for someone named Maureen.\n\nI called the store and immediately realized the person on the other end did not care at all. I told them I had passed my phone interview and they said that wasn't how it worked and I needed something else, a reference from the phone interviewer or something. It's still unclear to me what they were trying to say, because I started panicking. I told them that I was just told to ask for Maureen. The person on the other end (still sounding bored, like it was a hassle to have to talk to me) said Maureen was out and would be back tomorrow. I said I would call back.\n\nCall back the next day, Maureen isn't there. Now, she's on vacation apparently and will be back the next week.\n\nOnce the next week rolls around, I get an email from Fry's saying that they're now pursuing other hiring candidates and are no longer considering me.\n\nI'm so fed up with the hiring process. Talking on the phone is so difficult for me. I just got the closest I've ever been to a job, and it feels like these people just spat in my face. Passing the phone interview was an accomplishment for me, but Maureen and whoever sounded so bored totally disrespected me.\n\nI'm thinking of going back to school now, but I just feel so pathetic. Friends and family ask me what I do for work and I have to tell them I'm unemployed. They ask if I'm studying anything and I have to tell them I'm not, at least not yet. Every single person asks me this. I'm tired of disappointing the people I care about and respect.\n\nI don't know what to do anymore. I don't care about having a glamorous job right now, I just wish businesses would be willing to accommodate people by offering literally any alternative to a phone call.",

I have two dogs: a husky who is 9.5 years and a Shiba Inu who is 4.5 months. \n\nI have generalized anxiety, and usually I can work myself out of a cycle (e.g., mind racing, same thoughts over and over, etc.). My husband and I are leaving to go on vacation for the first time since we got the puppy. We don't have a lot of money, so we can't afford a nice home sitter or a fancy doggy day care. We have a boarder who we can afford, but I can tell it isn't the best for my older dog. I'm worried that it's going to be an issue for my younger dog too. \n\nI know they're a business and they have taken care of my older dog fine (he just has separation anxiety himself). How can I get these worries out of my mind? I am boarding them tomorrow for the trip and I've been laying in bed for two hours trying to get my mind to stop racing. Does anyone have any advice for these cycling thoughts? \n\nI've thought of other boarding services but there's nothing else we can afford. The trip itself is paid for as a present to us. I tried to find something I could deem \"better\" in our budget to no avail.",

I know for sure I can't be in big crowds. I feel like everyone could turn on me any moment. I have to see everyone in there and ask myself if I could take them if they attacked me.I'm fine with being on stage, I just did a musical for the first time. The cast got to perform one of the songs at an assembly on Friday. I sang and danced and all was fine. Then we had to sit back down in the bleachers. I could feel that I wouldn't be able to sit through the rest of the assembly in there. I know some things that I can't handle and I know when to leave for my own good. So I ask a teacher if I can go to the commons area outside the gym and she says she's not allowed to let me she says it like she thinks I'm just trying to skip. I tried to explain but she told me to go sit down. I get to sit there and feel the panic set in. The whole time I knew it was completely avoidable. I knew when to leave. They wouldn't let me. The worst part is my school has started doing monthly assemblies. I cant do them. I'm going to fall back into self harm. I got to sit there and feel myself go mental amd cry my eyes out on the bus ride home and I knew when to leave and I knew I could've prevented it all but I wasn't allowed to. I'm upset because you'd think being diagnosed would make things easier at school. The school has record of my co edition but because it's mental it doesn't matter to them.  I'm scared this is just going to repeat itself.I don't know what to do.",
