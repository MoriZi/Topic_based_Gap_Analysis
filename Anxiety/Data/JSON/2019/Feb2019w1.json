Because I never found someone 'like me'. (Not being arrogant... Don't know how to say it otherwise...)\n\nWe all have this same goal; reduce the anxiety to a level at which it's manageable, right? Because really becoming fearless is highly unlikely (and I think not healthy.)\nBut we all have a different starting point. \nSome had a bad experience 6-7 months ago... \nSome had a trauma 6-7 years ago... \n\nBut there's also a group of people who are suffering from their anxiety as long as they can remember. From 'birth'\nI'm one of them, unfortunately. I'm diagnosed with a Generalized Anxiety Disorder with panic attacks which resulted in a deep depression on the side. Served on a plate of Avoidant Personality Disorder. \n\nPeople of 'my group', has anyone a working coping mechanism?\nI'm just so tired.. 16 years of, different approached cognitive behavioural therapy based, talking.. 10-11 years of swallowing various medication options. \n26 years of exposure in vivo. \nMeditation, walking, exercising, etc. \nAnd nothing really changed. \n\nIt's also hard to work when you don't have a memory you can fall back on. A memory of how life was without anxiety. Then you have some handles to hold onto. A goal of which you can calculate the distance. \nI just don't know what to expect of life. \nI find that very hard. \n\nAlso I don't have parents to blame. No divorce, alcoholic dad, or emotional  numbed mom\nMy parents and family are full of love and understanding. And always helping me finding ways to achieve some small successes.\nOnly problem I see is being raised over-protective. But I find the punishment 'life long anxiety' out proportion. You know what I mean? (Also I thing I find hard to cope with. The guilt my parents feel of me suffering though life.)\n\nFor some context:\n26 years old, living at home, studying anything and everything that interests me (music, electrical engineering, webdesign, graphic design, Sketchup, literature, health, etc), hardly ever go outside, holidays are awful. No experience in relationships, never had a girlfriend, never had sex, never kissed a girl. Miraculously finished high school. Unemployed - Not searching.  And luckily I got a few good friends left who are empathic and occasionally help me with my exposure objectives. ('Mission 1: get outside'). \nAnd many more things I can tell, but...\n\nHow do you hold on? What technique or therapy really helped you? Or if it's possible, how did you get better? From a life long state of anxiety to a manageable dose.   \n\nCan someone help me out with info? \nThanks in advance!",

I am an introvert and highly sensitive person, so I usually have some level of anxiety, but now it feels much worse suddenly. I keep having constant unwanted thoughts about my past negative experiences with men (allowing people to take advantage of me, not respecting myself, random hook-ups that I regret) out of the blue, which I am constantly fighting against in my head, making me feel exhausted. I have also noticed that I am just more anxious about everything in general, especially in social situations (I am shy and introverted already, so it just feels amplified now). \n\nI also feel like I might be experiencing some depression too. I have had a low mood, lack of interest in my usual hobbies and passions, lack of motivation to exercise and do anything, negative self-esteem and low confidence and overall feelings of sadness and wanting to cry randomly. \n\nI don't know what's going on with my brain but this anxiety and possible depression is making me even more anxious. \n\nI have visited my naturopath who prescribed me Vitamin B, Vitamin D, Magnesium, Omega 3s and a herbal treatment with St. John's Wort, Passionflower and Valerian. I have been taking the vitamins consistently for months, but just started the herbal treatment a few days ago and haven't noticed a difference yet. \n\nI have an appointment set up with my doctor and a therapist early next week. Nothing has really changed in my life recently, except from being in a stressful and overwhelming job, which I started last summer. I have noticed that I have been feeling more stressed since then. \n\nDoes anyone have any advice or suggestions for me? What has worked for you to get the thoughts to stop? ",

            "selftext": "I just recently have began battling with my anxiety. I guess before I just didn\u2019t realize I had anxiety and never sought help. I started seeing a counselor and getting into meditation but I still find it extremely difficult to get out of my head once I start overthinking. If something happens I cant shake my anxiety and usually just break down crying or shaking. I get really sad and just continuously go over the conversation or my actions that made me start overthinking in the first place. Now I just start feeling bad about myself like why can\u2019t I be normal and why can\u2019t I get out of my head? In addition, with my significant other I overthink so much between our conversations, especially texting. If I think he\u2019s mad at me or I did something wrong I just spiral. I\u2019ll usually send another text or call him and if he doesn\u2019t reply it gets so much worse. Then I feel like I can\u2019t overcome my anxiety attack until he replies to me. Usually in these situations I feel like he\u2019s not on the same page as me and didn\u2019t think anything was even wrong. Has anyone else had similar issues and if so how did you overcome it? I really don\u2019t want to use any medication but I\u2019ve been feeling down lately and never know what will set off my anxiety. ",

            "selftext": "My heart issues are:\n\n- I have a pretty high resting heart rate at around 80 to 90.\n- I am extremely aware of my heartbeat and feel like it is thumping way too strongly to the point I cannot even sleep on my stomach anymore because I can feel how my heart is thumping against the bed.\n- I regularly measure my pulse by hand and it always *feels* to me as if my heartbeat was irregular.\n- I regularly experience shortness of breath.\n- I regularly experience my heart twitching in my chest, but I suspect it is actually just the muscles immediately surrounding it.\n- I regularly experience chest pains of all variety, but especially sharp pains in my left chest.\n- I regularly feel dizzy and experience numbness in parts of my body.\n- I am fatigued often (but I also have been suffering from the flu twice this month).\n- This isn't a symptom but my grandfather died at age 45 of heart complications.\n\nI say heart issues, but rationally speaking they are most likely the results of anxiety. I am a 25 year old man with no prior major health issues. I do not do sport regularly right now out of fear it might set my heart off, but I am rather thin with low body fat and a pescatarian diet. I have frequent encounters with panic, muscle tension, worrisome and intrusive thoughts, insomnia due to worrying about my heart and dying in my sleep mostly, gut issues and nausea. I have started taking CBD yesterday and it helped some, but the heart symptoms are still there.\n\nNow this being said, what should I do? Should I go to the doctor (an appointment will take weeks) or should I start doing sport to test my limits, combat the anxiety and build heart health? I am afraid that going to the doctor means that I acknowledge my fears as legitimate. That I will spend the weeks until the appointment in an even greater state of fear and panic and that all of it is ultimately some irrational avoidance tactic that ultimately just leads to my anxiety worsening even more. On the other hand just going ahead doing sport might similarly increase my fear of pushing my heart to a limit it cannot take and that eventually I might just drop dead, whereas going to the doctor would ideally confirm that I am healthy and I can do cardio without worrying about my heart.\n\nWhat ought I do?",

Whether it be medication, mediation, or therapy or whatever is needed. I understand it's not something that is completely treatable but if no steps are taken to circumvent their disability than it's incredibly inconsiderate to their partner or society. Thoughts?

            "selftext": "A little over a week ago, perhaps 2 weeks ago now my wife got sick in the middle of the night which woke me up. Shortly after I myself started feeling sick so I went downstairs and convinced myself that I was just in my own head. My heart was beating a million beats per second, I was sweating, shaking, and nauseous. After convincing myself I was just being silly I finally calmed down but this took hours and hours of standing in my kitchen trying to calm down. By the time I finally felt comfortable enough to fall asleep it was about 5am and I had to call in to work because I needed to be at work at 8.   \n\n\nI woke up at about 9 and got very little sleep, I spent that day taking care of my wife trying to make her feel better. I didn't have an appetite the whole day and outside of feeling a bit sleepy I actually felt fine. That night before bed the very same symptoms washed over me and I spent the whole night standing in the kitchen again trying to calm myself down once more. Heart racing, shaking, nauseous, tired. I went to bed around 5am again and again called in sick to work.   \n\n\nMy wife was at this time fully recovered, I hadn't told her what was going on as I didn't want her to worry/think I am weird. When she came down that morning at about 9am to see why I was asleep on the couch I told her I had really bad insomnia and had fallen asleep down there. That night while I felt very nervous about having this happen again I was so tired from lack of sleep that I finally fell asleep at about 9 but I woke up early that morning at about 4am and had to run to the bathroom with horrible diarrhea. After that was done I got worried again and started shaking, I felt like the walls of the house were closing in on me and felt like if I didn't leave the house I was going to be ill. So I went to work very early and told my boss I was just trying to catch up on work that I was behind on from calling in. I lied to my wife and told her that I got an on-call and needed to go in early. (again the thought of her worried about me makes me anxious). I got into my office and much like I would in the kitchen I sat in my office and calmed myself down then felt completely fine. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThat night rolled around and I started having those extreme feelings of dread wash over me like I was becoming ill again. I had to tell my wife at this point what was going on, so I told her that I just needed to get out of the house for a minute, so I went to Walgreens panicking the whole way there but as soon as I got there I started to feel completely normal. Once I got there I was hoping to buy zzzquil but ended up getting NyQuil to basically force myself to sleep. I took it and fell asleep woke up the next morning feeling GREAT that I had finally gotten a nights sleep.  \n\n\nEvery single day now for going on over a week, I spend the whole day feeling completely fine. As soon as I get home I feel twinges of anxiety but I tell myself if I just take my mind off it I'll be fine so I read and watch TV. Sometimes I'm okay until about 7pm then the very same horrible feelings wash over me, I leave the house and go stand in my office in the middle of the night until I'm calm, then go home drink some NyQuil and go to sleep. Sometimes I'm fine until even later, I wake up at like 2am and start panicking then have to leave the house to calm down at my office some more before going back.  \n\n\nMy wife has been going through a very hard time emotionally with the loss of our pregnancy and being depressed because of work. I want to be able to be there for her, but I spend all night at the office trying to calm down. We went on a date yesterday in hopes that getting out of the house would make me okay and she could tell I was miserable the whole time. This anxiety, wherever it has come from is completely controlling my life. I don't know what to do, I don't know where to look. I'm becoming extremely depressed because I miss my wife, I just want to be able to be home with her in her time of need. The more depressed I get the more anxiety I feel.   \n\n\nI am completely lost, I've never in my life suffered anxiety.",

I was hoping to vent a bit here and maybe get some advice. \n\nI've been suffering from really terrible anxiety and what started as overwhelming fear of home invasions moved into health anxiety and hypochondria. Anything that I feel physically I immediately make into a fake illness. If I have a stomach ache it's probably a rare illness from those leftovers I had yesterday, if my head hurts it's a tumor, etc. \n\nIt's been putting a strain on my life and I don't know how to make it better.

I always tell myself that I shouldn\u2019t talk about my ex to any women if she doesn\u2019t ask about it.\n\nMost of the times my psychiatrist is always mens or middle aged lady.\n\nThis time, I don\u2019t know how and why hospital just assign me with cute young doctor around my age she wear glasses and have resemble with my ex.\n\nThe moment I saw her I say with my self \u201cOH CRAP, RED ALERT HOW CAN I TELL HER ABOUT MY SYMPTOMS\u201d \n\u201cYOU NEED TO TELL HER ABOUT YOUR RECENT DEVELOPMENT AND HOW YOU STILL MISS YOUR EX SO SHE CAN FIND A WAY TO TREAT YOU\u201d\n\nI feel like I can\u2019t talk about my ex in front of her but you need to fake it.\n\nSo I talk about my anxiety on my job finding stagnation while my mind scream \u201cTALK ABOUT YOUR EX, SHE IS HERE TO TREAT YOU, TELL HER.\u201d\n\nI notice that my talking speed start to slow down. I find that I keep avoid her eye contact and my mouth hardly move.\n\nThen I tell har about my ex but I find it hard to express aspects that psychiatrist need to know because I feel somewhat attract to her.\n\nThen she ask me \u201cso, are you still looking for girlfriend ?\u201d This question almost break me down. My Id tell that she is flirting with me while my superego tell me she is doing what she supposed to do and also wall of psychiatrist ethics bar her from dating me if she really wish so.\n\nIf she really want to date me and really date me it would be nice. but having her as my psychiatrist is making me really uncomfortable and kinda hinder my treatment.\n\nSo far I haven\u2019t told my hospital to avoid incident like this, it\u2019s really not her fault too. I want to express this.\n\nThing is nurse office and department administration is right in front of her office I can\u2019t really tell all the nurse that I find this uncomfortable.\n\nI wish I can tell someone or even her that I find her attractive and make me uncomfortable.\n\nSo thank r/anxiety to let me use this space. Thank you\n(I still have butterflies in my stomach)",

I have experienced pretty severe health anxiety for a few months and I was getting to the point were I was beginning to feel like I was going insane. Anything that slightly felt different on my body would just force me into a panic and I thought I was going to die. I was wanting to get help and didn\u2019t want counseling because I don\u2019t like talking to strangers about my problems. I didn\u2019t want pharmaceutical drugs because I don\u2019t want my personality wiped from me and so I found out about CBD oil. I have been consuming my CBD oil by vaping it but you can use the dropper and put it under your tongue or in your food and get the same results. I have felt an extreme increase in focus and overall have been more relaxed and happier than I have felt in a long time. I seriously couldn\u2019t recommend it enough. Anyone who wants a remedy to calm their anxiety without counseling or pharmaceutical drugs then try CBD oils. I recommend \u201cKoi\u201d brand oils, as those have been what work best for me. But everyone is different so find what you like. If anyone has any questions then ask and I can try to answer them to the best of my knowledge. Have a good one everybody!",

I only stayed at both jobs for a couple of weeks because of my social anxiety &amp; I felt really incompetent. I haven\u2019t been working the past few years because of lack of confidence. I\u2019ve applied at several jobs &amp; even scheduled interviews for some, but always ended up being too anxious and never show up\n\nBut tomorrow morning I have an interview at a dog boarding facility! The job will pretty much be me taking care of the dogs &amp; playing with them. Not too much interaction with humans besides co-workers which to me is a great thing. Even thought I\u2019m feeling nervous I know I have to show up because a job this good doesn\u2019t come along often. I can\u2019t pass it up. \n\nI\u2019m mainly feeling nervous about coming off as too awkward or if I say the wrong thing or smothering. I keep overthinking about little things like what do I say when I walk in? \n\nOverall I know this will be a good thing for me because I\u2019m 19 &amp; I\u2019m going to have to get a job at some point. Plus it will be nice to be able to start to save money &amp; be more independent but idk I just hope it all goes well! ",

But it's still an every day battle, even right now I'm having mild anxiety about if I washed my hands enough today to avoid getting norovirus. \n\nSometimes I get the feeling that this is all in my head. That maybe, even though I've been diagnosed and taken medication and everything, that maybe this isn't real. This can't be real, I can't be this afraid of nothing. I can't be afraid to leave my house, I can't be afraid of just freaking existing. The triggers I have can't really be real. I can't be so afraid of my own body that some days I cringe when I'm about to be touched.\n\n **These feelings I struggle with day in and day out can't be real.**\n\nDAE feel this way sometimes?",
