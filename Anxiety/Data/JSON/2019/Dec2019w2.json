I want to try get them again, is it worth it? I'd most likely be on a low dose of citalopram (UK).\n\nI tried therapy (CBT) it did nothing for me. I find it hard to implement the behavioural techniques you learn at therapy.",

Consumed it within three days, and felt sick and I could keep down food or anything. I think I slept most of the time, but after it over I didn't feel right and had what I thought was a stroke but the firefighters who showed up after informed me it was a panic attack. My arms locked in place, and half my face felt numb. It was honestly the most terrifying thing I've experienced, and has crushed that invincible feeling that comes with my age. I don't trust my own body anymore, and am get anxious just hearing people describe something similar as if it could just happen to me again out of no where. \n\nThe problem is now when ever I feel slightly like that, or think about my breathing or think my face feels tingly it's like a constant thought that races in my head. During my ride to work in the mornings I get it the most especially if the ride is longer then 30 minutes, and I'll have to pull over because my neck and arms start tensing up and I get terrified over it.\n\nI was watching live PD and that exact scenario happened to someone else, and it kind of sticks with me more now. The song \"friend noodles\" is stuck in my head kind of keeping me down to day. Specifically the lyrics \"I live in a constant state of fear, and misery do you miss me anymore?\"\n\nIn a way I feel robbed of what I used to consider normal things, and it's sad to me because I know it's not a big deal and I should be able to. I feel incapable, or less then in some way as if I should be able to fix it.",

Not too infrequently, I end up having a bit of a, I don't know how to word this, \"freakout.\" Like I get frustrated or something, overly stressed, other things. Occasionally I can keep myself under enough control that I can stay in the classroom. Sometimes I have to leave for a few minutes to calm down. Well, my parents know that they happen, its been a problem for as long as I can remember, but I never tell them nowadays when it happens, so I think I might start making a log of ever major time it happens(like today, where I got way too frustrated during History and had to leave for a few minutes to calm down).\n\nPS see  [https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/e7ypk5/what\\_would\\_you\\_say\\_about\\_this/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/e7ypk5/what_would_you_say_about_this/)",

            "selftext": "So I've been dealing with really intense regret the last few years. Some quick background:\n\nMoved out of my parents house in my 3rd year of uni and lived by myself for the first time. Had my first panic attack one night, that spiralled into constant anxiety symptoms, depression, chest pain, crying. Got diagnosed with GAD soon afterwards, and have been dealing with it since. This has taken the form of therapy, meds and group therapy.\n\nI'm 33 now and I've spent loads of the past 13 years fighting against my anxiety. Once my anxiety came on in my early 20s, it became harder to make friends. It really destroyed my self-esteem and made me feel so unlikeable. I feel I always have a guard up and find it difficult to make meaningful connections. The severe anxiety took a toll of the way I acted and many of my friendships in college fell apart. I'm envious of seeing my friends with their circles of close friends, having fun, and I just feel like I'm too old and anxious to really make a change. Even at work, I feel my coworkers are much closer with eachother and I'm kind of the misfit. I missed out on partying/socializing in my 20s because I was just too busy dealing with my anxiety. I don't travel because I'm terrified of airplanes. I have awful health anxiety which really limits what I allow myself to do out of fear. I didn't drink until I was 25 because I was scared of alcohol and what could happen. And now, I can no longer drink because of the anti-depressants so that social lubricant I enjoyed is gone.\n\nI just keep thinking about how so many people got to really enjoy their 20s and foster friendships with others. I try so hard not to wallow in regret because I know it's a waste of time, but it's hard not to beat up on myself and feel lonely and hopeless. I know I should be grateful for what I have, and part of my problem is that I am deeply pessimistic. But I figure others here can relate - How do you deal with these thoughts and feelings?",

I always feel bad that I can't turn to anyone because they often think that I'm just being a snowflake and tell me that I have it easy. They're right, I am financially free, I have an incredibly supportive family, I go to a top school as a grad student with a ton of exit opportunities, and I am making pretty good money at my new job for my age. But that's what keeps me up at night: that I'm not going to a BETTER school, that I don't have a BETTER job and that some of my peers are making way more money and career moves with far fewer resources. It's what makes me wake up in a cold sweat, heart pounding, teeth clenched. I am incredibly anxious and I realized my average resting heart rate is 90 bpm. From the outside, there is literally NOTHING I should be anxious about. Yet I am. I am currently 24 and turning 25 in a few weeks. Could it be guilt that I didn't do more considering the opportunities I have? If anyone has any recommendations on how I can \"chill\", it would be greatly appreciated. Thanks!",

However episodes were getting closer together &amp; the last month or so has been horrible. \n\nAfter talking to my dad &amp; my boyfriend (they\u2019re my go to\u2019s when I need rational thinking &amp; talking down) I made the decision to go see the doctor today.\n\nEven though I have history of anxiety &amp; depression I still feel like the doctor will think I\u2019m lying &amp; get so worked up before I go. As it turns out he was very helpful, understanding &amp; let me talk. He gave me a plan of getting back up to the dosage I was on before &amp; signed me off work for a week.\n\nThe next hurdle was telling work I\u2019ve been signed off (though in the UK you can self cert for a week before you need a doctor to sign you off. Not sure if it\u2019s the same elsewhere) which has always terrified me. I\u2019m rarely off sick &amp; my last sick day was about a year ago. My manager was good about it &amp; reassuring that it was ok. \n\nSo now I have a week to get back on the tablets &amp; into a better headspace. Today I made sure I\u2019d cleaned up my flat, eaten something, wrote out the dates &amp; dosages of the tablets in case I get fuzzy &amp; then took my first dose. Currently feel quite groggy &amp; nauseous but I know it\u2019ll get better.\n\nWhat I would like to say is don\u2019t be worried about asking for help. There is no shame in it &amp; actually it makes you strong as fuck. If one doctor doesn\u2019t take you seriously, go &amp; see another. You deserve help just as much as the next person. If you make progress &amp; regress, get back on that bastard &amp; kick it into submission. Be kind to yourself &amp; it is ok to be \u201cselfish\u201d.",

It's the anxiety.\n\nI was recently hired to teach English classes to French native speakers and it's really exciting ! Except... I have really bad anxiety over adjusting to new people and over social interactions, in general. They have provided a work email address to me, but I couldn't find the courage to actually check my emails after the first time, out of fear that someone would have sent me an email that I wouldn't have known how to respond to. I know it's super silly and I hate that I do that. I was just hoping that nobody would have tried to get in touch with me after the initial contacts, but surely enough... someone did. They contacted me last Thursday! A week ago ! What the fuck!! I hate myself. Why do I do this? Can anybody else relate? (I downloaded the Outlook app on my phone to connect to my work email, so the notifications will actually force me to check my damn emails despite my anxiety).\n\nI do the same with messages from acquaintances on Facebook. If someone I haven't talked to in a while reaches out, I will ignore it as long as it's morally possible. I'll put my phone face down so I don't have to be reminded of their message. I'll get really anxious at the thought of actually reading the message (if itsn't short) and having to form a response. I'll log out of my account if it makes me too anxious. \n\nOn a somewhat related note, I consider deactivating my Facebook account around my birthday every year because I absolutely hate it when people I'm not comfortable with talk to me. It makes me way too anxious.",

The thing is, my doctor ordered an ECG just to be sure but my mom doesn't want me to get it done because she's 100% convinced that I'm just a mess and it's all anxiety's fault.\nSo the question is, to what extent can anxiety make you feel breathless? Just when You're having a panic attack or all the time?",

I've been chatting with my online friends in a online game, it has like it's own home page, and we got our own wall page like Fb does. Posting own post, comments, and all.\n\nSo, I've been talking and messaging to them for few days, 'cause it's been like 7-8 months since i talked to them. And well, we kept missing each other recently since we came online on different timing cause of different time zone. We are all from different countries. And when i logged in today, i saw one of my friend online. I wanted to talk to him but i got so scared. I went online to the world, but i logged off immediately. I wanted to hang out with him again, chat with him, but i was incredibly afraid cause, i saw his other friend was online too. They were probably hanging out. I felt like i'll just bother them, maybe i wont be able to make a conversation with him(i'm bad at conversations), maybe it'll get awkward and he wouldn't want to talk with me again, maybe he wouldn't notice me coming online and there were just so many thoughts.\n\nBut after an hour or so of calming myself down, i wanted to cry at myself. Why do i think such things? Why do i not see myself as if i'm not worth anything? Why can't i can't stand on my own ground? Like I'm his friend too, and he'd miss me or he and other friends of mine wouldn't have posted on my wall page, pestering to come online, and missing me. Why do i have to back out? It's not even like, we're even hanging out in real life. We would just be hanging out in virtual world game. Why do i have to be so afraid, even in a.... game?\n\nI feel so stupid. But genuinely, one thought that shook me was \"why do i not see myself of someone worthy?\" sigh.\n\nI apologize to whoever read it, it's dumb but i wanted to vent..",
