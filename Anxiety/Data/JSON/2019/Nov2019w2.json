I'm now in 6th form and I'm really trying, as I have motivation to study in NYU (I'm in UK) but I switched subjects and have a lot to catch up on, as well as a demanding subject in art, and volunteering to bulk up my uni applications, as well as working and exercise which is part of a bigger eating disorder a and even listing it is giving me a melt down, I can balance studying, work, volunteering and exercise, if I stick to a regiment, but the catch up is killing me as I deal with work in the worst way possible which is chronically avoiding it, not to mention my home situation is less than desirable and I have no genuine friends, I have been considering suicide which I know sounds ridiculous but if I fail myself i don't think i can live with staying in England I just want to escape.",

But often it\u2019s small stuff like doing a load of laundry or returning an email. When we put these things off they still will occupy mental bandwidth and just hang over us.  So go lessen your load and just chose one thing you\u2019ve been putting off and do it.  It doesn\u2019t have to be a big thing. Go do the dishes, clean your room, return that email, make that phone call, go for a walk...whatever. Lessen your load and you\u2019ll feel better.",

I suffered from skin picking as a child, but it mostly went away with age. The habit has recently reemerged in the form of picking my facial hair whenever I'm anxious.  I'm going back to school full time and dealing with way more stress than usual. This is especially bad whenever I'm sitting at my computer.  I am desperate to fix this habit. I've pulled off enough of my hair that my face looks spotty, and I know if I continue, the hair will start to no longer grow.   Does anyone have experience with this or skin picking? I've tried meditation, but it doesn't seem helpful here. I tried making it, so my face is always shaved, but that doesn't seem to stop me from pulling hair out.   \nI've considered buying some fidget contraption but wasn't sure how helpful it would be.  \nThanks!",

            "selftext": "I have been dealing with some rough depression and anxiety for a couple of years and have spent most of my fall college semester in therapy. Today was my last day of my therapy appointment with my school and today I\u2019m cleared for outpatient! (I\u2019m excited I had to share. I\u2019ve never completed any sort of therapy- I usually chicken out). In those sessions I learned a new thing about grounding. \n\nWhile it may work for some, it didn\u2019t entirely work for me so I asked if I was doing it wrong. He told me that I\u2019m not grounding wrong but doing it poorly due to my anxious state. So I want to share this quick tip with you guys and hope it\u2019ll help you too if you\u2019re in the same boat as me. \n\nAs if it were normal grounding, pick a sense to be your main focus. I recommend hearing or touch. Now, don\u2019t try to focus on more than one thing with that sense. For example, if you have ocean waves playing in the back, only focus on that. If you\u2019re laying down, focus on the feeling of that blanket you love so much. If you need a little extra, do both at the same time. I find that this is more relaxing than trying to find 5 things I can see, four things I can hear, etc. \n\nMaybe you guys knew about it but I learned today and wanted to share! Happy grounding :) \n\nAdd tips below! I\u2019m always looking for new ways to calm my anxiety and I\u2019d love to hear something new.",

            "selftext": "I went to the movies with a friend, I was very excited to see Doctor Sleep, and suddenly during the trailers I felt like crying for no apparent reason. It was horrible, but I shook it off. Maybe it was the trailers that made me emotional? After all, music in movie trailers is often used to its advantage to heighten emotion and excitement. The movie started and I had a really uneasy feeling throughout. I felt short of breath (I am a casual smoker and have never experienced this before, so I don't think its that)and noticed my heart was beating very fast. I was anxious, and I didn't know why. I am a seasoned horror fan, so I doubt i was spooked by the film. In fact, I was forcing myself to stay because I had been looking forward to this movie for months. I got up and went to the bathroom, and I suddenly felt very dizzy. I went back into the theater and sat down, but about 5 minutes later I felt even worse and I asked my friend if we could please leave. We left and as I was walking down the hall and out of the theater, my breathing got faster and faster and I felt even more light-headed. I sat down on the curb and cried my eyes out while trying to hold my breath. \n\nI'll never forget how it felt. Everything was so loud as soon as I had exited the building, cars passing by were so loud and I felt like I could hear everything. My hands, face, and neck started feeling numb and I felt like I was dreaming. People passed by looking at me, I have never felt so much embarrassment. I felt defeated, weak, and utterly alone in my head. I feel bad. It was so rough. I had never felt this way before. I have been anxious many times, but I've never experienced sheer panic like this. The most frustrating part is that I don't even know what caused it. \n\nAs soon as I woke up that day, I had a lingering feeling of unease that I could never get out of my head.I'm usually always on edge and always overthinking. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI don't know if this is appropriate for the sub, and if it isn't, I apologize. It's just nice to get it off of my chest.",

Happened to me 3 fucking times these past couple months. All times I freaked out and went to the ER. EKG was fine, troponin and d-dimer was fine. Told me it could be anxiety. Went to my PCP and got tested, everything is fine, told me it could be anxiety. Have an appointment with cardiology and that's probably gonna be fine too. and guess what he's probably also gonna tell me it's anxiety. Funky thing is the symptoms would stop right after I get out of the ER reassured that I wasn't actively dying, then come back a week later. This really sucks. I can't count how many nights I went to bed trying to prepare myself to not wake up the next morning because it's actually a heart attack this time. I feel like the physical symptoms are just making my anxiety worse which will circle back to making my physical symptoms worse. I can't live like this. It's driving me absolutely crazy. Anyone else with a similar story?",

I really like him and he says he really likes me too. We enjoy spending a lot of time together and have met each others families. We have a ton in common and are very sexually compatible.  This is the first good relationship I\u2019ve had. I\u2019m 25\n\nYet. I am always terrified he\u2019s going to break up with me. Right now I think what\u2019s triggered it is because the last time we hung out we didn\u2019t have concrete plans to see each other next. Not to mention there a lot of milestone coming up I\u2019m scared will make him think to end things. \n\nWe are just about at 6 months. My birthday is coming up. Christmas and New Years are coming up.  These are a lot of big things and he may want to get out before they happened. \n\nHe\u2019s given no sign he wants to end things and we are planning on future stuff. But at the same time I\u2019m still terrified. In addition we haven\u2019t said the L word yet and I honestly am not sure when people usually say it. \n\nWhat is wrong with me. Why do I feel so I loveable that I think this decent good guy wants to break up with me ? \n\nDoes anyone else have similar issues ?\n\nDidn\u2019t realize I\u2019d rambled on this much.

I can tell you that I was convinced that I was about to die or that I had a disease or something. My body started hurting like crazy, I started seeing dots in front of my eyes so could barely walk, i started shaking, I couldn\u2019t really hear people, I got tinnitus. And believe me when I tell you I had it like this for months later MONTHS, it felt like a constant panic attack and I thought I was going crazy. My parents was about to call an ambulance but didn\u2019t since they were convinced it was anxiety. \n\nWhatever when people tell me that they have anxiety over like an exam or some homework. It makes me feel like I really should visit a doctor if that\u2019s really how anxiety is (which it isn\u2019t). It makes me kinda mad too cause like I really thought I was dying and other people are saying that they are anxious over these things when they don\u2019t even have any physical symptoms cause if they would\u2019ve felt real anxiety then they would\u2019ve probably be about to call an ambulance or do something. \n\nI\u2019m sorry I just had to write down a little and let people know that anxiety is sooo much more than just worrying. It\u2019s literally physical symptoms that sometimes can make you feel like you have a deadly disease. It\u2019s really tough to live with and I\u2019ve had this for a couple of months now but it is getting better but I still feel a lot of physical pain so I usually just stay in my room.
