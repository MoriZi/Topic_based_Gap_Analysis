            "selftext": "I was SO nervous all last night and all day today about this interview. Interviews are a MAJOR trigger for me, I almost always have an anxiety attack in the middle of them, and I\u2019m really not very good at them. On top of that, it was for a bilingual role and I knew I\u2019d have to speak German and I was so insecure about my fluency and so freaking anxious that I would totally bomb and embarrass myself. \n\nI was SO close to canceling. I made a million excuses to my friends in family about why I didn\u2019t really want the job anyway so I might as well not go. I am so, so glad I didn\u2019t. \n\nI experienced a bit of anxiety, but no attacks! I wasn\u2019t stammering and awkward like I usually am and I was really confident in all of my answers. Best of all, when they brought in the German dude so I could converse with him, he said it was really good and my pronunciation was great, and after he left they all said he\u2019s Never been impressed by anyone\u2019s German before!!!\n\nI never feel good or confident after leaving an interview, but this time I do. I Really Really Really hope I get the job (the office is UNREAL, benefits are wild, free breakfast and lunch, everyone was super laid back, better pay) but even if I don\u2019t, I\u2019m just so damn proud of myself for forcing myself to go instead of bailing like I always do.\n\nJust had to share because I feel super happy right now. :) wish me luck!",

Now to some this may seem like an everyday thing but for me this was a big step. After that I went to my first ever lash lift appointment. I was so unbelievably excited to treat myself to this. I laid down, closed my eyes and the woman began my treatment. I knew from the beginning I had to keep my eyes closed for a good hour and a half but, I had no idea how I would react. Once she had the perm solution on and she took her hands away from my eyes to let it sit it all sank in. I immediately started to feel dizzy and like I needed to open my eyes IMMEDIATELY. Now, a few years ago I would have just sat there through my anxiety attack and just dealt with it because I didn\u2019t want to bother her. Today, I very politely explained to her that I needed to have it taken off and I would still pay her for the service. She was so kind and understanding that she didn\u2019t charge me for anything and told me I could always come back and try again another day. Again, to some people this would sound like a failure. I failed to complete the treatment and I felt so overwhelmed, embarrassed, and upset. But, I asked for a different lid today. And that\u2019s a win in my book.",

            "selftext": "\nAnxiety Hack #1: Get up and move your body!\nIt\u2019s pretty hard to give in to feelings of anxiety when you\u2019re engaged in physical activity and those happy hormones, or endorphins, are getting released. This hack works best if you start moving as soon as you begin to experience those anxious thoughts and the adrenaline creeping in because it\u2019ll prevent the anxiety from escalating. Choose a type of exercise you enjoy or even something childlike, such as bouncing on a trampoline or doing the \u201cCotton-Eyed Joe.\u201d I dare you to try one of those and not crack a giggle. Also, if possible, take it outside for the extra benefits of sunlight, fresh air, and a dose of vitamin D. \n\nAnxiety Hack #2: BREATHE.\nOne of the most effective and simple deep breathing exercises for calming anxiety and overall relaxing is the 4-7-8 breathing technique developed by Dr. Andrew Weil (based off of pranayama yoga.) \nHere\u2019s how you do it:\nFind a quiet and comfortable place to either lie down or sit up straight with good posture.\nRest the tip of your tongue on the roof of your mouth, right behind your front teeth.\nLet your lips part and make an obnoxious whooshing sound as you exhale through your mouth.\nThen, with your lips closed, inhale through your nose as you count to 4.\nHold that breath for 7 counts.\nExhale from your mouth for 8 counts. Don\u2019t forget the annoying \u201cwhoooooooshhhhh!\u201d It\u2019s key. ;)\nDo this at least four times.\n\nAnxiety Hack #3: Repeat affirmations.\nSaying affirmations out loud to yourself may seem out there, but can be extremely powerful when it comes to taming anxiety. The following affirmations have worked for me at the peak of an anxiety attack when I\u2019ve felt crippled by that impending feeling of doom and darkness. \n\u201cI am okay.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ve been here before. This too shall pass.\u201d\n\u201cI am more than my anxiety.\u201d\n\u201cI will transform my anxiety into positive, calming energy.\u201d\n\u201cI breathe out tension and breathe in serenity.\u201d\n\u201cI breathe out fear and breathe in love.\u201d\n\u201cI will overcome this like I always do. I am getting stronger and stronger.\u201d\n\u201cI am safe within myself. There is nothing to fear.\u201d\n\u201cMy body is filled with loving and calming energy.\u201d\n\nAnxiety Hack #4: Write it out.\nJournaling, or just jotting down those thoughts that are running through your mind at the speed of light, in the moment can bring you some peace. If you don\u2019t have a journal, use the notes section of your phone and write out whatever thoughts you have running through your mind. Whether it\u2019s a to-do list of things you need done by the end of the week, a poem, or a bunch of swear words, writing it down (or typing it out) is a form of release. Trust me, you will feel some tension lift.\n\nAnxiety Hack #5: Listen to feel good music.\nMusic has a powerful effect on your mood and energy. The key is to listen to happy, calming music, even if that\u2019s not the type of music in your Spotify library. Choose music that reflects the way you want to feel and that will soothe your anxious mind. Personally, my go-to for happy, relaxing beats is anything by Kygo, Sam Feldt, or Bonobo.\n\nAnxiety Hack #6: Get in touch with your spiritual side.\nConnecting to a higher power is pretty much a guaranteed way of calming down feelings of anxiety. Whether you choose to pray, meditate, chant mantras, or hold crystals, doing something spiritual will help ground you and give you peace of mind. My favorite way to calm my restless mind at night is to take an epsom salt bath, turn on my latest Headspace meditation, close my eyes, and just focus on my breathing. Actually, this combines three anxiety hacks into one 10-minute activity - meditating (getting in touch with my spiritual side), deep breathing (hack #2), and self-care (hack #7). \n\nAnxiety Hack #7: Show yourself some tender love and self-care.\nThere\u2019s nothing better than stopping an anxiety attack in its tracks by doing something pleasurable for your mind and body. When you feel those dreaded, worry-filled thoughts manifest in your body as a rapid heartbeat or sweaty palms, throw your hands up, say \u201cthat\u2019s enough!\u201d and go treat your poor body like royalty. Get a massage, give yourself a facial treatment, get a mani-pedi, take a bath, get your hair did, anything that you know will make you feel good, physically. Taking care of yourself and your body is therapeutic. Self-care is a form of self-love and self-love produces positive thoughts and emotions, which crowd out those negative, fearful feelings.\n\nAnxiety Hack #8: Love your anxiety.\nYes, you read that right. One of the ways we tend to make our anxiety worse is by judging it and ourselves as something negative and horrible that needs fixing. If there\u2019s one thing you take away from reading this article, I hope it\u2019s this -  every belief or behavior has a positive intention, therefore any negative thoughts or destructive behaviors are not the problem. They are just the best solution you have come up with so far.\nWhat if, instead of looking at your anxiety as something you hate and want to \u201cfix\u201d, you saw it as the only way your mind knows how to cope with whatever it is you are dealing with? What if you looked at your battles with anxiety as victories that make you a stronger person? What if you listened to what your anxiety is trying to tell you and focus on fixing that problem?\nThe thing about anxiety is, we put so much energy, time, and money into trying to heal the symptoms of anxiety when what we really need to heal is the fear or trauma that triggers this unnerving cascade in the first place. Which brings me to the last hack\u2026\n\nAnxiety Hack #9: Listen to and get acquainted with your body.\nIf you\u2019re experiencing symptoms of anxiety and you have no clue why or where they\u2019re coming from, it\u2019s time to take a closer look at your lifestyle choices and health. Three of the top anxiety triggers are caffeine, sugar, and alcohol. If you\u2019re consuming any or all of these, try eliminating them from your diet for a few weeks, preferably a full month. Then, slowly add one in at a time to see how your body responds. Chances are, you won\u2019t go back and if you do, you\u2019ll find a healthier and more moderate way to integrate it into your lifestyle. \nHealth issues, hormonal imbalances, and food allergies can also trigger anxiety. Make sure you know what\u2019s going on inside your body. Knowledge about your body\u2019s natural tendencies and providing your body with nourishing, whole foods is groundbreaking when it comes to managing your anxiety. Once you\u2019re more in touch with your body and its needs, you begin to trust your mind and body and their reactions. You\u2019ll begin to feel energy shifts when you walk into rooms or engage with others. Your intuition becomes clearer and you\u2019ll be able to tell the difference between \u201cgood vibes\u201d and \u201cbad vibes\u201d...and act accordingly.",

Because i so desperately want help with my anxiety. i was there on time, spend 45 minutes in the waiting room. At first i was okay, waiting patiently and then after 30 minutes i got so angry. After 45 minutes i went to the receptionist to ask what was going on, and she told me there had been a misunderstanding.\n\nI almost broke down in tears, i was so sad and felt like no one cared. I finally reached out, asking for help. its hard to do that and then this happens. \nI rescheduled for juli 11th, but i feel like i need help before that... two weeks is alot of time when you are feeling this way every day. \n\nWhen i walked out of the place, I immediately started crying so hard. I am kinda worried about how much that simple misunderstanding bothered me... Normal people would have brushed it off and would have just been a little pissed.",

            "selftext": "So me and my boyfriend are together for almost a year and he's been living with me since the first of January. We are inseparable, and with that, I mean it literally. If I go to another room, he will come too. We both don't really have friends so we are always together and we love it. Call it a honeymoon fase, we don't think it is. We have a really big love for each other as we are both in very difficult situations and we finally found someone who understands and who's there. \n\nThis weekend it was time for a festival he goes to every single year and he would love for me to come along. I'm in a wheelchair due to a physical disease and I didn't know if I could make it through the whole weekend (Thursday 10AM-Sunday 2AM). We got access to a wheelchair camping and we had a very comfortable place. I loved it there. I saw some bands I really love, and everything we did just felt great. I was on cloud nine to be honest. But that all crashed down when I had to leave yesterday. I was in so much pain that my painkillers didn't work anymore and I could barely breathe. We had to make the decision that I would go home, and he would stay there. It would be our first night without each other in more than 8 months. He always goes with a group of 'friends'. He knows one person from when he was a child and the rest he knows through her. But they don't really talk to him. They let him tag along and only talk to him when they need something. I had to leave him behind with them. He would still sleep on the separate camping but would hang out with them. While he didn't drink at all in the two and a half days that I was there, the moment I was gone he started drinking. He said he was scared he couldn't get me off wheelchair ramps anymore and I guess that's a legit reason and he means it, he's sweet like that. He sent me some videos of bands I had to miss and he was singing along really loud while he ever sings, and even though we went to one of his favourite bands the night before he just sat next to me on the wheelchair stage and didn't do a thing apart from cuddle me. It looks like he's having a lot more fun now that I'm gone. He keeps reassuring me that that's not true and that he misses me. I'm having a really hard time believing that because I'm incredibly insecure and it just seems like he's having the time of his life now that I'm gone. I know he means it when he says he wants me there, but when I see him having fun like that I feel like a major burden. \n\nBack to the point. It was my first night without him and it felt like he would never come back, even though I know he's coming back tonight. It still feels like I'll never see him again. Does anyone else feel that way when their partner is gone? It's not that I don't trust him, I know that he's loyal and he's absolutely the sweetest guy ever. And yet I'm incredibly anxious. I cried really hard when we said goodbye at the festival and he held me for a while. And I'll probably cry when he comes back. He promised to come back immediately after the last show, which will be around 1:30 AM. I hope he does. It still feels like I said goodbye forever. One side of me knows that that's bullshit and that he'll be back soon. But my anxiety keeps telling me he's never coming back home. What do you guys do when that happens?",
