            "selftext": "My doctor is an academic professor at a medical university. He says mouth breathing is endemic in modern populations and that up to 90% of children and adults partially mouth breathe. Starting at a young age, this can cause a child's face to grow long and skinny with crowded teeth, a bad bite, a deviated septum, and a narrow smile. These features, reflective of small jaws, cause us to essentially suffocate, rev up the sympathetic nervous system, and consequently disrupt our sleep and cause symptoms of a anxiety. He said I am basically breathing through a straw and suffocating. Unlike other doctors, medication was not his first choice. Rather, he was focused on strengthening the muscles of my airway. He referred to me to a book called \"SHUT UP and sleep\" written by a Stanford doctor for more information and I was astonished. I had never heard this before. Has anyone else heard this? Is it possible, at least for some, that anxiety could be an offspring of poor physical development, breathing, and sleep?\n\nHere is the link to the book if anyone is interested:\n\nhttps://www.amazon.com/SHUT-UP-sleep-anil-rama-ebook/dp/B07XCF1BHL/ref=tmm\\_kin\\_swatch\\_0?\\_encoding=UTF8&amp;qid=&amp;sr=",

            "selftext": "I don't know if this is anxiety at all, but from the symptoms and what seems to happen every time, I think it is. But I've been telling myself that it's normal to have this constant fear, or constant dread wherever I go for years now. \n\nI've convinced myself that it's not normal at all.\n\nToday, I was hiking in a canyon near my house, I've been there a few times before. From the start I was super on edge and afraid, I guess afraid that someone would kill me or that somebody would follow me, and pictures flashed of all the things you hear about in horror stories in my mind through the entire ride. I had to stop at one point because I was getting super hot, dizzy, and breathing extremely rapidly and was just so afraid that my body seemed to want to shut down. It didn't get better until I got to a point where I could see everything around me, at the top of a hill where it was clear out, and I started to calm down, but I obviously couldn't stay there forever because I had to go back. It was rough.\n\nEvery time I leave the house, 9/10 of the time when I leave the house and am going somewhere alone, whenever I get to the destination I'm **always** checking over my shoulder, looking around, listening for whispers or noises, trying to reassure myself that everything is okay yet it's not okay and it gets to the point where I just leave. I used to think that I wasn't afraid of anything tangible, and I don't know if this is a \"fear\" or something else, but it's bothering me so much.\n\nI don't know where it stems from, but I know that it's not normal.\n\nFrom things like walking a few blocks to get to the store, to photography at night or even at day in remote locations, today biking in the woods on a little dirt trail, going on drives alone and stopping to use the bathroom, hiking, or even just getting something from my car outside my house, I'm always checking over my shoulder, looking around me, listening for something off. I heard the sprinklers go off last night and jumped and ran inside because I was afraid, and I don't know why.\n\nIt's holding me back so much in life. I love exploring, especially alone. Abandoned places, forests, mountains and trails, cities- I just love exploring and being out in the world and seeing things. I just can't. One time I tried to go to an abandoned building, I started shaking and freaking out because of fear. I don't know why. I know it's not the smartest idea to do that anyways but I mean, I'm 17 years old, I want to live my life and have some fun, and make Youtube videos about it all.\n\nI can't speak to a therapist about it because I can't speak to a therapist because insurance won't cover it anymore. I just had my last therapy session a few days ago because that was the last one we get for awhile. I don't want to tell anyone because I'm ashamed of it but then again, here I am on my main account opening up to everyone in the world. I don't know anymore. Does anyone  have any suggestions?\n\n(it's a lot better when I'm not alone, but definitely not gone. Still always in the front of my mind, even in safe locations.)",

            "selftext": "My anxiety is definitely genetic-based and it's just gotten progressively worse the older I get. I can remember having panic attacks when I was a little girl of single digit age. I don't have anywhere near as many panic attacks now at almost 29, but the constant underlying anxiety is so much worse. I cannot leave the house while unmedicated because I just have massive panic attacks cause my brain keeps telling me *something* bad is going to happen.\n\nAnyway, I'm about a week and a half into being on Zoloft's generic for the first time at the lowest dose (I'm sensitive to meds and have had lots of problems with side effects in the past) and I thought it was going pretty well. Then today happened. I don't know why, but I have felt paralyzed with anxiety today for no reason. The only time I've really moved is to get up to go to the bathroom and occasionally drink some water so I don't trigger a migraine from being dehydrated or anything.\n\nThe only new \"stressor\" I can remotely think of is this writing exchange I'm in and the due date is in a few days. But even if a hobby I enjoy is giving me some stress, I have never been paralyzed with anxiety over a looming deadline like this. Idk if this is some kind of temporary adjustment issue with the zoloft or if I'm just having a REALLY off day or what's going on. I just wish it would stop. I do have an as needed ativan script that I could take, but I don't like relying on it too much since addiction runs in my family. iirc the last time I took one was last week so I'm probably okay to take one now and my anxiety is what's making me hesitant.\n\nIdk. I just needed to vent. I haven't done anything today and it's still been an awful mhi day and that just REALLY sucks :/",

I just feel like something is constantly on my chest and the only time I can relax is when I occupy my mind. I randomly think of something and immediately I feel like something heavy is on my chest. Like not even something big, just random thoughts. Whenever someone changes their tone or they feel upset I immediately feel a sinking feeling in my chest and my mood doesn't get better until they assure me that they are fine(and it's rly hard to assure me). Also, when my dad or mom ask me to go somewhere with them and I say no I feel guilty and overthink how I don't help my parents and that they are going somewhere alone because I said no. Situations like these rly mess with my head. I hope I'm not crazy and that this is something fixable.",

            "selftext": "I just got out of school and started working for my Dads family business. I have depression anxiety and multiple health issues. When I first started working I had 4 hour days. One of the employees had a family emergency and had to move out of state. I\u2019m very close with my Dad and hate seeing him worry so I thought I\u2019d help him. I decided to fill in until someone else took the position. My dad works in construction and I\u2019m a small female, so whenever I would talk to someone or answer the phone they would always ask to talk to someone else, or they would tell me I\u2019m not experienced enough. For weeks I asked my Dad and manager everyday if anyone responded to the ad and they repeatedly told me no. 4 months into working customer service I finally told them I couldn\u2019t take it anymore, they told me unless I wanted to work somewhere else I\u2019d have to work customer service. They finally decided to tell me that they took the ad down the week I started working and had been lying to me the whole time. 7 months into working I had a anxiety attack because they worked me so hard. I went from 4 hour days to 8 hour days which was major for all my health issues. It\u2019s now 8 months later I\u2019m terrified to leave my house. I haven\u2019t worked in a month and everyone\u2019s mad at me for ditching them. \nShould I feel bad for leaving? I tried to advocate for myself, I would have done anything not to let my Dad down and I feel like I did. \n\nThank you for reading :(",

But why did she start dating my friend?  The person she knew I confided in and gave me words of advice regarding her.  I'm glad she wants to be friends, but seeing them together brings me pain.  I never liked the idea of breaking off contact with someone but I can see why now people do.  This girl who confided in me, told me she liked me, went on a date with me, and then suddenly she doesn't like.  I could accept she did not like me, but to begin dating my friend.
