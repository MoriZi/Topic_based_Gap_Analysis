I left her alone there and I went to the first floor to watch TV.\n\nWhen adults came back they asked for my sister, I told them that she was upstairs, having a bath, they seemed worried and they went to the bath, I followed them, I didn't understand the situation.\n\nWhen we entered the bathroom she had drowned, they took her out of the bathtub and she was almost blue and really cold. Everybody got really nervous, they called 911 and stuff.\n\nSo, basically I killed her.\n\nThe relation with my family has never been the same. I am still in therapy for it, I have tried to kill myself time ago. In addition I was adopted so I spent months thinking that my family was going to \"give me back.\"\n\nMy mother has told me several times that it wasn't my fault, but things will never be alright, I know that she is still disgusted of me.\n\nI will never stop feeling guilty, I am really sorry.

So I can't help feeling that I'm the problem child at work and everyone must think I'm such a drama queen. There's always *something* going on with me. \n\nI really try to hide it. I try to tough it out when I can and find private places to rest for a minute when I need it. I try not to let people see me get upset. I wish I could help people understand that I don't *want* to do this or be like this. They never say anything, but I'm certain they're silently judging me.\n\nAnyway... yeah. Anxiety sucks.",

            "selftext": "These are just a few things that help me and want to share in hope it can help you too.  \n\n**Keep a pep talk and counter on your phone of how many times your anxiety has been wrong**  \nI have a note saved on my phone including a pep talk, something I can read along the lines of \"You're going to be just fine, remember all the other times you felt this way - nothing bad happened and won't happen this time either\" and so on.  I also have a counter of how many times my anxiety has been *wrong* and wasn't justified in the end.  That number is 147 at the moment.  The counter for when my anxiety has been *right* is still at zero.    \nI'm somebody who likes statistics and can look at those numbers and think \"Oh, wow, all of those times my brain has been wrong!\" \n\n**Go somewhere you can think**  \nWhenever I'm struggling, I tend to jump in the shower.  The sound of the shower drowns out any other noises, the warmth makes me feel physically comfortable and I can begin to think, run through things in my head properly.  Sometimes I also get into bed, I don't always sleep but sometimes drifting off and waking up hours later *resets* my body.  Though of course, if you're in a strong anxiety attack it's not so easy to just 'go to bed'.  \n\nI suppose this point only applies if I'm at home, but there's no harm in finding a comfortable *safe spot* when outdoors.  \n\n**Have a good, trustworthy friend**  \nI don't like running to my best friend whenever I'm having attack because that friend will just get sick and tired of me doing that.  But there's *nothing* wrong with having a friend you can confide in and trust, and most importantly a friend that understands and can say the right thing.  It's also important, when you're not suffering with anxiety, to make an effort to be a good friend to him/her in return.  \n\nMy past therapist told me that there's absolutely nothing wrong in seeking help from a friend even on a regular basis, as long as you're not relying on that.  \n\n**Write about it**  \nMaybe just because I like writing, but it can actually be very therapeutic.  Whether it's physically writing or writing a blog post on your own blog.  I have an anonymous and private blog, so nobody can see it, and sometimes I'll write in full about my experience and it's almost as if I'm telling a therapist about it.  Reading back my own words immediately after often makes me see my condition/attack in a totally different way.  It's like stepping back and seeing it from another person's eyes.  Our anxiety is in our head but this lets you see it with your eyes and I have no idea if this makes sense but it really helps me.  \n\n**Herbal teas**  \nI'm not a tea fan (even though I'm British, I know) but herbal teas are so, so good.  Chamomile is perhaps the best one when it comes to anxiety and calming the nerves.  Peppermint tea is very good if you're getting a nervous stomach, it can help calm things down.  On top of all that, it contains the most healthy thing in the world - water.  Even water alone makes me feel physically better after 30 minutes or so and that in turn (I believe) helps my mind too.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm aware not all of this will be useful to everyone, maybe none of it will be useful but I'm just hoping - as someone who suffers with these attacks and struggles to get out of them - it'll help at least one person out there!",

I just feel like I have to get this off my chest. \n\nGrowing up I was a very shy kid, and would often get extremely nervous when encountered different social situations. I remember when I was like 10 I had my best friend spend the night and just before he arrived, I got in the shower so I wouldn't have to say hi to his dad, even though I had already met him before. I ended up taking a long ass shower and my friend made fun of me about it for the rest of the night lol. Basically I just thought that it was normal for introverts to hate social situations. I'm always been very self conscious about my outside appearance.  I know that everyone gets nervous, but it shouldn't be excessive. I wish I realized that sooner.\n\nI thought I was just shy as my entire family has told me that I'm quiet and shy; but it seems like they didn't realize that my excess shyness was a red flag. I don't blame them; generally speaking they're all extroverted. \n\nOver the past couple of years in undergrad I think i developed mild GAD. In the mental health shithole that is grad school my GAD got worse (doctor says moderate) for a slew of reasons, and likely triggered a bout of depression and a downward spiral that I've been trying to claw my way out of since February. Been doing counseling since march and started taking zoloft a month ago.\n\nShout out to everyone whose mind's as fucked up as mine. This shit's hard but we're doing the fucking thing",

I might have extreme mood swings. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI say come at me. Come the fuck at me you fucking ass hole. I'm still standing. 4 years in and I'm STILL STANDING. And I will keep standing. I will not draw a line and say ok, you win, and kill myself. You are noise in my head, and you can keep dreaming of winning. Because you won't. I am worthy of happiness, of spontaniety, of friendship, of love, of starting a family of my own, of having kids some day. I am worthy of respect, courage, power, and kindness. I am worthy of all things good that you take away from me. But you are not winning. See, today, I had good moments. I made a new friend, we sat in the sun talking. I met another friend, had a beer and a falafel, also in the sun, also talking about life, scaring seagulls away. Later I read a book that seems good. \n\nYes it's mostly dark. And even though the voice in my head says all kinds of stupid shit while I'm typing this, like \"Oh but you don't really think you're gonna get out alive?\", I am writing it. Look at me. I am writing it. I am not letting it win.  \n\n\nDay by day.",
