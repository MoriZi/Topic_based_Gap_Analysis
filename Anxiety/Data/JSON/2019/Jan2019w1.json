            "selftext": "Eight years ago, i was diagnosed with chronic anxiety. That time, i shrugged it off thinking, \"hey, this is normal, right? Everyone gets anxious sometimes. This will go away, right?\" Wrong. Here i am, eight years later, cringing at past me for even thinking that anxiety goes away like a seasonal flu.\n\nI spent some time going through therapy sessions, and while those helped, they didnt really cure me of my anxiety*, because for people like me, anxiety is ever-present -- an annoying, unwanted companion i am eternally cuffed with.\n\nI struggled battling anxiety for a long time. It was hard to be a fully-functional human when every speedbump looked like a giant boulder in the middle of the road. Instead of looking for ways around it, my focus was on the speedbump-boulder and how impossible it was to conquer it. Anxiety paralyzed me and made me feel like i was always bound to fail.\n\nThe smallest tasks would sometimes trigger anxiety and panic. I would cross the road planning my funeral because what if the bus hits me? I would get invited to parties, and yes i craved to socialize, but i would bail because what if i spill the drink and make a mess of myself? Public speaking was the worst subject ever, because that triggered so much what-ifs. I was sweating with just the thought of mispronouncing words and forgetting my lines. There were days when i thought i was perfectly fine, then i would be attacked by constant panic and pressure that took away my ability to function, and i would shut myself in, because anxiety was crippling that way.\n\nI quit a lot of things in my life -- school, jobs, relationships -- some, i didnt even get to start, all because i worried i wasnt good enough. I was scared of taking a course i wanted because what if i couldnt find a job after i graduated? I couldnt take these programs because what if i fail them and i had to retake them? I resigned from my teaching job because i feared no one would take my subjects the following year, that i might not be a good enough instructor. I was scared to build relationships and would stop talking to people i really liked or wanted to be friends with, because what if they dont understand me?\n\nBecause that was what i felt, that no one understood me. I craved validation and support, but instead, some of the people i cared about left me for being \"over-dramatic\" and a \"cry-baby,\" only because they didnt understand what i was going through. Well, same. How could i blame them when i myself couldnt understand it?\n\nAfter years of battling anxiety, i got fed up with it and i internally told it to fuck off. It didnt. But i knew i had to do something about it, or else, i wouldnt be able to really live. I knew that there was only so much i could do to help myself. So i did. I read self-help books, which, if i would be honest, really didnt help that much because they all say the same things i already knew (still good reminders, though). I started reaching out to my fellow anxious people and asked for advice, because, you know, it takes one to know one, and they were the best people to talk to if i wanted to really get myself. Little by little, i gained confidence about who i was and what i was capable of. It took years and a lot of hard work, but i learned so much, and i couldnt be any more thankful to the people who helped me and made me feel a little better about myself.\n\nFast forward to a few years later. I cant say that i dont get anxious anymore. After all, anxiety is already a big chunk of who i am. Maybe i just learned a few tricks to manage it somehow. Or maybe it just doesnt scare me as much as it did before.\n\nThe fact is, there is no one-size-fits-all approach in managing anxiety. Some people fight their anxiety. Some people try to ignore it. If it works for you, then it must be for you. But if there's one thing i realized for myself, it's that fighting my anxiety is a losing battle, so i embrace it instead. I take a break. I breathe. I ground myself to my surroundings. This way, i know that i have control of the environment im in. I recognize the situation and try as much as possible to think logically. I acknowledge the facts, and while i cant really do anything about my emotions, i talk about the situation to the people who care to listen. If im alone, i express what upsets me through writing. I walk. I go for a run. Not to try to escape the situation, but to shake off the excess nerves. I look back to what makes me anxious and assess what i can do about it. If i need to take a break and feel the emotions as they happen, i allow myself a few hours, or maybe a few days to let it run its course. I think to myself, \"it will pass.\" It always does.\n\nTo my fellow anxious people, you got this. It is a hard road, and you may sometimes feel alone, but youre not. Be kind to yourselves. If you need to cry, do it. If you need to rest, take as much break as you need. If it's too much to bear alone, seek help.\n\nTo everyone else, anxiety thrives in a person's inability to take control of a situation. When someone feels lost, it is important that they feel secured, heard, and validated. This is why it is important to show kindness and compassion to everyone.\n\n\n(*Disclaimer: Im not saying that people should ditch therapy like i did. It just didnt work for me, but im sure it helps others. Please, please go/continue going to therapy if you feel that it helps.)",

She developed OCD and left 5 kids with their daddy. Practically my childhood was hell, except the times I was with my dad. He\u2019s an angel! \n\nI\u2019m the youngest in my family, now 21. I never spoke to anyone about what happened with my Mam, when people asked where she was I said on holidays! I put a brave face on. And I was good at doing it! \n\nI\u2019ve done a lot of stupid shit in my life, got a DUI when I was driving home with my bro after being in Amsterdam.. That fucked me up a little bit as I had aspirations of being in the police etc.  So since then I\u2019ve partied hard in college! \n\nI drank way more used drugs more commonly and I was loving it, this only lasted 4 weeks though! Woke up after doing MDMA and had a massive panic attack #Yikes. I thought I was dying and on the cold kitchen floor at 5am in the morning all I could think about was my dad and how I let him down, between everything. \n\n3 months on and I\u2019m suffering really fucking badly from anxiety panic attacks etc. the panic attacks have kinda ceased, but I\u2019m in a constant fear and stressed out about the anxiety - and its symptoms. This is all so new to me! \n\nAnxiety symptoms (Weird vision/headaches/inability to swallow/heart palpitations/dis realization) \n\nI\u2019ve started seeing a guy in Dublin, he\u2019s an holistic therapist. He\u2019s helped so much compared to all the other avenues I\u2019ve tried in my bid to feel ok again. He believes it\u2019s all this trauma I\u2019ve experienced coming out now and I don\u2019t have any mental disorder etc. rather an emotional one! To my relief.\n\nI\u2019m very sporty and outgoing usually but I have now deferred college and stopped working. Literally isolated myself so much to this day, I just can\u2019t seem to get back out there. CONSTANT FEAR is really starting to make me suicidal. That\u2019s why I\u2019m writing this tonight is the worst night I\u2019ve experienced, I have been planning my death the past week. Getting money in order for my dad and writing letters. This needs to stop, I know I have the power to change this but I don\u2019t have the courage or strength. \n\nI just cry. I\u2019m so alone. I\u2019m so afraid. I\u2019m so lost \nI just want to be loved. I wish I had a mother who I could love now more than ever. I want my life back.\n\nThanks for reading. Goodbye ",

            "selftext": "Over a year ago I started driving for Uber because we very seriously needed any extra money. I had to stop almost immediately because my anxiety wouldn\u2019t allow me to in good conscious drive others around. I felt devastated. I felt like a failure. I felt like shit, I couldn\u2019t help my family when the time needed it. \n\nI recently picked up where I left off because his work gave a hefty heads up that they were taking off for the holidays for way too much time and it was unpaid. I\u2019ve been doing decent with it. I\u2019ve helped make enough to help us stay afloat and was able to help make sure Christmas was still magical for our kids.\n\nI knew tonight (or last night) would be a big deal, good money. All the time leading up to New Years I\u2019ve been debating if I wanted to put myself through it with my anxiety. I\u2019ve been doing OK but what if it was too much on me? \n\nI fucking nailed it. I made more in one night/morning than I\u2019d made the whole week combined. I was sociable! I freaking went places I\u2019ve never driven before. I don\u2019t know. I feel so on top of the world. I remember feeling my throat tightening in between one ride and thinking \u201cit\u2019s just roads sunny. Just roads\u201d and was able to calm myself down. I\u2019ve NEVER been able to calm myself down. In fact by the end of the night I was eager for new rides and I was calm. \n\nFlipping calm, a word I never ever thought I\u2019d used to describe myself ever.  I don\u2019t know how long this high will last but.. I\u2019m glad I can share it with you all. Happy New Years! \n\nAlso, for anyone wondering. I\u2019m medicated and in therapy and just got out of IOP, I know it doesn\u2019t always help everyone but I put a lot of it into that. Me getting help. ",

            "selftext": "I've dealt with anxiety my whole life and recently it has been worse than usual but manageable. \n\nI can usually manage my symptoms through exercise and breathing exercises and (I don't like admitting it) alcohol.\n\nI occasionally get anxious at work but I can manage by going on a walk or going into the bathroom for some breathing exercises. \n\nToday was the worst. I turned my head too fast and became extremely dizzy (world spinning, never felt like this before). I sat down and tried to regain my composure but with the dizziness it set off the worst panic attack I've ever had. I couldn't breathe, my heart was racing, I was shaking to the point of tremors. I told my co worker I thought I was gonna pass out. He sat next to me and tried to calm me down and I then asked him to take me to the ER. He did and I was diagnosed with vertigo which had thrown me into an anxiety attack.\n\nNow I still feel im recovering from both the vertigo and my anxiety. And I'm horrified to go back to work. What if just being there throws me into another attack? I'm so embarrassed about this happening in front of all my co workers. What if I start spinning again? The ER dr shrugged off my anxiety and basically said to just deal with it. I plan on calling a psychiatrist tomorrow for an appointment to talk about potential medications. Is there anything else I can do to ease my anxiety for work tomorrow?\n\nAlso thanks for reading, I also really needed to vent about this.",

Once at 6 am and again at noon. I haven't thrown up since, but now my mom got the exact same thing but way worse, intense stomach pain, and was throwing up way more, way more frequently, and violently, all within the span of 3 hours. She was taken to the hospital, but hearing her violently throw up while she was here just made me so scared just like it always does when she gets these things. I'm still recovering myself which makes me so scared. I don't want to get it again but worse this time like she had, and that makes me feel awful feeling that way because I was the one who got her sick and I want her to get better. But I'm just so scared again to the point that I taped the door to my room so that way I can isolate myself as much as possible from the rest of the house. Now it's night time and I hate night time in the winter, it makes me feel trapped, scared, and alone, because I've always had this feeling like everything bad happens at night like this. I don't know if I'm just panicking or if I'm still sick, but I feel like I'm gonna throw up again, and now I don't have anyone here to comfort me again if I do and I'm freaking out. How am I ever going to get over / control this fear? I can't take this anymore, my heart is always racing, I'm always scared, It's affecting my health really badly and I just want it to end. Someone, anyone, please, help me.\n ",

            "selftext": "I don\u2019t really know how to classify this problem I\u2019ve been having, I can\u2019t tell if this is just anxiety or something more because I haven\u2019t had this happen to me before and I haven\u2019t really had anxiety to know if that\u2019s what this is.\n\nSo, these \u2018attacks\u2019 I\u2019ve been having started after seeing my Grandpa. He\u2019s got Dementia and the beginning stages of Alzheimer\u2019s. I hadn\u2019t talked to him a lot or been to see him at all in a year before I visited him this thanksgiving (he lives out of state) and seeing him genuinely messed me up. I don\u2019t know how to explain it, he\u2019s not all the way gone but the cracks in his reality are starting to show in big ways, and a huge part of me, as selfish as it sounds, worries it\u2019s gonna happen to me eventually. The thought of that sends me into a spiral that\u2019s hard to come out of. I will think I see something out of the corner of my eye like I normally would before but now my brain will immediately think of him, and how he looks/ acts now and how that could be me one day. I can shake it off but random thoughts come into my head and I can\u2019t seem to stop them from reoccurring.\n\nI just feel like it\u2019s important to say that because my \u2018attacks\u2019 have only happened after seeing him and I feel like they are in some way a build up of the reoccurring bad thoughts I\u2019ll have because of the thought of him. (I know I may sound like a bad person as it\u2019s not his fault he\u2019s going through this and I love him with all of my heart but I genuinely can\u2019t help the way I feel, I feel horrible for even feeling this way and having these thoughts.) \n\nThe attacks will happen at random but something small always triggers them. For example, I\u2019ll lay in one position for too long and my arm or leg will start to go to sleep. I\u2019ll have a simple thought like \u201cwhat if this tingling only gets worse\u201d and before I can rationalize that I\u2019m okay or even react myself, my body will react in the worst possible way, to the point that I\u2019m convinced something has to be wrong because of the way my body is reacting. It\u2019s like I loose the ability to control anything regarding how my body feels and it acts on its own. It\u2019s like I\u2019m having a conversation with my body trying to calm it down but my body is telling me It feels like there\u2019s definitely something wrong. It feels like I\u2019m going to die and something going on with my body will make me die at any second. I don\u2019t know how to explain it properly because it feels so surreal when it happens, but the best example is that it feels like, within a fraction of a second, someone else is coming into my body and controlling all emotions and rationalizing for me and all I can do is deal with it. I\u2019ll tell myself I\u2019m okay and that nothings wrong but my body will genuinely feel like there\u2019s something I need to get ready for, like something horrible is getting ready to happen. My feet will feel cold, my head will start to feel flushed and I get dizzy, all because of a simple \u201cwhat if\u201d thought that I\u2019m not worried about anymore because I\u2019m worried about how my body is reacting over everything. Then once it feels like I\u2019m about to pass out because of how intense the experience is, the emotions start, it feels like every \u2018on and off\u2019 switch for every emotion I could have is being flipped on and off repeatedly. It literally burns, and feels like I\u2019m a battery being drained to 0% and charged to 100% within a few seconds over and over, or like I\u2019m a pilot who\u2019s only ever flown in auto pilot and then in the blink of an eye, while flying, I have to know what everything does and how to fly a plane I\u2019ve never learned to fly. All I can do is cry when this happens and try to call my mom or brother who think I\u2019m crazy trying to explain why I\u2019m crying and shaking but talking semi normally and responsively. It\u2019s out of my control. I\u2019ve never experienced anything like it before. I normally completely stop worrying about my body at this point, because whatever made my body freak out moved to my emotions, and I just try to manage the emotions because the emotions are worse than the initial attack. Then just as quickly as it all came, it\u2019s over. I feel like I\u2019m in control again, of my emotions, rationality and body. I normally just scream into my pillow after this and calm down knowing it\u2019s over but cry thinking about it happening again. This will all happen in about 5 minutes. \n\nThis is hard for me to share and if you made it this far I really appreciate it, I never thought I\u2019d have to reach out for help about my mental health and it\u2019s really scary to do so. I\u2019ve only had this happen 3 times since thanksgiving but each time is just as bad. If you know what this is, even if it\u2019s just anxiety, or maybe you deal with it as well, any response will help me feel better and not so alone. ",

            "selftext": "I have been on Prozac for 2 years. 40mg capsules. I am a 24 year old male. I can honestly say it helped me get out of bad depression, anxiety, and OCD intrusive thoughts. I am in a good place now. Work a full time job, exercise, have a girlfriend, am fun to be around, etc. However two things are bothering me. One, I experience some sexual side effects with my girlfriend (low libido, delayed ejaculation, erection difficulties). This is something that\u2019s bugged me for a while and I believe it\u2019s due to the Prozac. Two, I plan on becoming a police officer in the next 2-3 years and don\u2019t want to have to be on antidepressants as a cop. I also worry it might hinder my eligibility to get hired. \n\nSo my question to you, have you weened off Prozac and had your anxiety and depression come back? This is what I fear most. Thank you",

My first semester, I was so busy with teaching and coaching one act I had no time nor energy to socialize. Once one act season ended, I have been slowly but surely trying to get out more. However the town I live in is extremely small, like 800 people, so there's hardly any sort of volunteer opportunities. I've tried reaching out to coworkers, but they are all married and/or with kids and busy. \n\nMy landlady is extremely nice, but the Tennant before me  had a cat that torn the place to hell now there's a no pets policy. She did say I could have a reptile or bird and I did get a fish, but it's not the same. A repitle or bird would be too high maintenance for me to care for, a cat would probably be the best for me. I know that b/c of my ADHD and anxiety I could probably qualify for an ESA, but I feel like it wouldn't be fair to my landlady. She's very good to me, and I don't want to look like \"that person\". I do have an appointment to speak with a doctor here so on, but I just wanted to to get some other opinions as well. \n\nDo I try to find a new place to live that allows pets or do I try to go for getting an ESA?",

Apparently A has been telling B a lot about me and, even though I don't know any details, most of it wasn't exactly nice.\nCW B also told me that A texted her saying that he thinks I'm 'a cutter' and how that totally turned him off.\nEspecially this made me extremely anxious, I'm nauseous and dizzy and took the long way to my Office to avoid running into A.\n\nI don't know why him being 'turned off' by my scars is so hard for me. I really, really don't want a relationship with A but I feel so abnormal and somehow freaky. To encounter how judgemental people are just scares me because how many others will think the same of me? I've made an effort not to let anyone at work know about my  mental health issues because of stuff like this.\nThe talking behind my back thing just worsens the situation.\n\nI feel so shitty avoiding him And I know I should talk to him but just thinking about bringing the subject up makes me shaky.\n\nHas anyone experienced something similar and has advice for situations like this?\nThanks for reading.",
