0,[Serious] Does anyone else just feel like taking benzos (legally) for the rest of your life?,"I’ve had anxiety since before Kindergarten.  I know it won’t get better despite meditation, cutting caffeine, exercise..  No matter what, it is this lifelong burden.  I dread the thought of valium or xanax for the rest of my life but I’ll be damned if they don’t work..  It runs severely on my mother’s side of my family and both my grandmother and mother take valium daily and have for years.  It’s both horrible, and horribly enticing.   I don’t know, just feel like giving up some times.  I would never hurt myself, by the way.  Just wondering if anyone else felt the same.",6,2018-10-21 17:41:19 EDT-0400

I'm looking for anyone who wants to chat daily. We'll can talk about our problems to each other, give support, and just talk about fun stuff together. 

Please give me a chat message if you're interested. I would really enjoy a friend. ",3,2018-10-18 05:17:01 EDT-0400

4,Little story about myself+ wanting to skip class tomorrow...,"Alright this will be a long one, just a bit of background info about me as I just discovered this sub. Ill try and make it as short as possible. It will seem messy and all over the place because it is lol. 

I am 19, male.

At the age of two I pulled a pot of boiling chicken broth off of the counter and it spilled all over my right arm and chest. 3rd degree burns and a year of being fed via a feeding tube. Years later probably around the age of 10 I started seeing a psychiatrist who prescribed me with 3 pills (i think one was zoloft, sorry cant remember the names of em) and was diagnosed with PTSD, ADD, ADHD, and bipolar (which was further tested to be untrue.) At the time I was afraid of swallowing pills, so I just crushed them up, which made me gag every time I took the pills (2 in morning one at night.) Eventually (over 6 year span) I effectively weaned myself off of the pills because the taste was so terrible, and I never felt like they helped me. I even would fake taking them when the nurse at a summer camp ""watched"" me take them. 


Start of my ""history"" with school: 

Middle school: Got good grades, would constantly go to the nurse and try and get sent home. 

9th grade: started in (lets call it school A, public school) and did TERRIBLY, never put ANY work in, got awful grades and feared going so bad I began to have panic attacks.            

Second semester of 9th grade: tried online school, got distracted while working at home, couldnt do it... Also, didnt get enough credits to move into 10th, effectively failing 9th grade.

9th grade round 2: I am fortunate enough to have parents that could send me to a private school, where I did O.K... I hated every day of it, and hated everything about it but got good grades in most classes (failed a few like bible classes) and still put no work in, didnt even study. Still had panic attacks about going and skipped 1-2 days a week. 

10th-11th: same as ^ but after tonsillectomy in early january of 11th grade, i was given ""2-3 weeks"" of medical absences by the doctor. I fell behind, and started to get anxious about catching up, plus my grades from the previous semester werent great, showing a possibility of failing 11th grade. I freaked, panic attacks galore. Dropped out of the private school. 

11-12th: started in a ""twilight program"" at my local votec, basically a joke of a course meant to be a final step to prevent people from dropping out. It was all online, and to be honest, i cheated on parts of it. I completed two years of it in a year and a half, and was given my high school diploma. 


Now, (2018)I have enrolled in classes at the community college. I am a freshman, currently attending a writing class and an algebra class. ( i have two mini classes too that start in a week, only half a semester long) Lets start off with the math class. I have always been a math guy. At first, the class was easy( or so I thought) then we recieved our first test which I got a solid 46 on. After that I missed a class day because I was sick, and now I am taking every excuse I can find not to go. Same goes for my writing class: A lot more work with this class, an essay every 2 weeks, weekly grammar assignments (it sounds like a lot(jk), but it isnt, im just a lazy idiot!) and other daily homework assignments. 

Part of the issue with college right now is that I forgot the math stuff I knew, and I have never ever been good at english. Also with the english class the teacher calls on each student to give their answer to whatever question was on the assignment, meaning that you have no clue if your answer is correct. I am terrible at english, I dont even know my parts of speech or whatever, so I constantly make myself look like an idiot giving the complete wrong answer... which gives me anxiety about attending class, making me fall behind in all of those assignments I was talking about earlier. 
 
My college has FREE math tutoring with my math professor but I am too fearful he will call me out on missing so much class and not comming in to get tutoring sooner... 


Other info...

I saw a psychiatrist for about 7 years, and a therapist for 10-12, still see her a few times a year. 

I live with my parents, oldest of 4 siblings. 

I applied for a job over the summer, and got the first one I applied to. It was as a dish/prep guy at a ale house type place. Lasted 5 days, quit in the moment because of my anxiety to break down the dish machine, mainly quit because it was a shit job and I had no clue what I was getting myself into. Started at 12.50 an hour, but they had me working prep AND dish with 1 other dude in a restaurant of 800 ppl, it was insaine.


Uhh feel free to ask me literally anything if youve made it this far. Also feel free to be brutally honest. I need it. Thanks.

7,Therapy made my anxiety worse... is there anything else I can do to try and help myself??,"This year I began going to therapy in an attempt to help my anxiety issues but the only issue is I wasn’t able to be “vulnerable” with my therapist. This caused me to stop therapy after only two months.

I know it sounds stupid, but the part of therapy that made me uncomfortable was that I wasn’t able to bring myself to talk about my issues. I fully trusted my therapist and she was incredibly understanding to me but I was just afraid to tell her anything that I deemed “too personal”  about my anxiety. The idea of letting my guard down to anyone, even a licensed professional, terrifies me because I’m afraid of their reactions towards what I have to say. I was afraid that my therapist, who’s job is literally to help my and not judge me, was going to react poorly to what I had to say. 

As a result of this habit, instead of talking about the real things that are troubling me I ended up spending most of my appointments watching the clock and lying about having simpler problems so I didn’t have to address the main problems. (this is the exact opposite of what you’re supposed to do in therapy, I know, I just couldn’t bring myself to be honest with her). This obviously caused me to make extremely minimal progress.

I want to help my anxiety. I just do not think I can bring myself to go to therapy again because I’m almost certain this scenario will repeat itself.  

Is there anything I can do to get through the causes of my anxiety without having to go to a therapist??",4,2018-10-18 06:17:25 EDT-0400

9,I develop anxiety in every job I get.,"Hi all.

I've suffered from what I can only describe as social and sometimes general anxiety throughout my whole life. I dropped out of college because my anxiety was so bad. I hated every moment I was there. 

I'm only in my early 20's and have had a handful of job roles since leaving school. I've worked in a small shop, McDonald's, and just recently a job at the college Library.

Working in the small shop, my anxiety only really got bad during very busy periods, but that was pretty rare so most the time I was okay. It was a very relaxed atmosphere.

At McDonald's, my anxiety went through the roof. I found it extremely hard to stay calm during every shift, and when I wasn't working I was worrying about having to go to work. I ended up quitting a few months in cause I couldn't get on the bus to work from the panic.

Now, although my job isn't nearly as hectic (and I enjoy my general role so much more), I still find myself getting very anxious when the Library is full of students. Telling students to be quiet or to stop messing around is the part that I just cannot handle. I want to do my job right but the anxiety makes it so hard. I'm getting scared of desk shifts because it's such a busy period right now.

I can't help but feel like every job I'm in, this will become a problem. I'd love a job which involved zero interaction with others but those jobs are hard to come by for full time roles, unless it's something like a more advanced IT/tech role.
Thanks for reading. I don't feel like I can really talk to anyone about it because they'll think I'll want to quit again.",0,2018-10-18 13:25:18 EDT-0400

11,Anxiety and music,"Hi! I just really wanted to share this and ask if anyone has any thoughts or experience with anything similar.   
So just to put it short, i feel very uncomfortable when i am around people and some music is playing, sometimes the most generic pop song makes me feel like i am suffocating, only when there are people around tho, otherwise i would turn it off. But in all seriousness it does not bother me when i am alone, then i just get annoyed and turn it off. Mostly emotional songs, but generic, tearjerker songs.. all that kind of stuff makes me want to throw the radio in a pit of lava. I do love music in general and i actually sing/rap and produce music myself as well and enjoy many different types of music, and sometimes some songs are fine to listen to with people, easiest ones are songs with no words.   
Anyone have any ideas or similar experiences please do share!  
Thank you so much for reading and your time!",1,2018-10-18 07:54:32 EDT-0400

27,"Therapy requires money. And to get money you need a job, but you can't get a job because you have terrible anxiety. What do people with anxiety really do? They're in a position, it seems, where there isn't a way out. This seems like a dangerous place to be","I could easily see somebody in this position getting very angry and lashing out. I work coding jobs that don't require any contact with people in the real world. i barely make enough money to get by. If this job goes to shit, which is very likely btw, I could be homeless and screwed.

OH yeah and there's the dreams that you get every night that increase anxiety and the reason why I'm posting on here is because I just woke up from one of them.

32,Mom is freaking out. Shooting a gun. Cops are coming. Snow storm. I don't know what to do.,"Update: Dishes are broken now too. 

Update 2: Police came; ambulance came. Had to wait outside. Back in now. Glass all over. Mom is still outside with police. Took her weapon. 

Update 3: Mom overdosed. Had to call the ambulance. Going to hospital now. She has to be committed to a mental health institution. 

Update 4: So far so good. In hospital. No one else came. Bunch of assholes I live with. 

Final Update: Had to leave the hospital around 9:00. Mom had to stay, but she seemed to be doing good when I left. Now I just have to suffer my narcissist father and victim-complex sister while this goes on.


I started posting here as I didn't know what to do and it put me at ease a bit. So thanks for all of your kind words. I was freaking out the entire time, and was mostly frozen, but no one else wanted to do anything but play victim.

34,I'm not ok,"I'm tired of saying ""fine"" when people ask how I'm doing; it's a blatant lie.  I like to pretend I'm not wading through a tar pit of anxiety/depression and ptsd. I'm tired of feeling like even if I did open up about what comprises the tempest of my own thoughts, no one would understand anyway and the waves of the maelstrom would wash me deeper into the depths of my own mind.

All things considered, I don't have a terrible life. I have a stable, decent job; I have a family that loves me, I have some good friends (even if none of them still live in the same state as me), I'm about to be able to afford my own place. But I can't see the pure good in that because my rose colored glasses are fringed with the pure black of mental illness. The last few weeks have actually been really good; I've been getting out more and reaching out trying to make more friends locally. But a flashback, plus a depressive episode and now a panic attack all within a few days makes everything good seem so far away. I hate that this happens. I hate that I have to rely on mind altering substances just so I can maintain the mask of a well-adjusted person. Worst of all I hate that I feel like I have no one me near me that would truly understand if I opened up about any of this. And I'm also tired of being quiet about it, and I needed to vent.

Edit: Thank you all for the responses; I felt a lot better after I wrote all this out and it means a lot to know that there is a community out there that gets it, and that I can reach out to.",36,2018-03-10 20:48:41 EST-0500

At the end of the day he settled on ""anxiety disorder unspecified"" for insurance reasons and said that he does think my issues stem from anxiety and that they are a potential cause for my irritability and anger. 
I feel really great about it all. I have a great therapist who is working with me on multiple issues and now I have a great psychiatrist who wants to listen, understand, and give me a helpful diagnosis rather than just medicate me and get me out the door.  ",13,2018-03-13 13:16:24 EDT-0400

40,Alexa is inadvertently helping my anxiety symptom,"I dunno if this happens to anyone else, but I have Tourettes-like random vocal outbursts during the day. As in, an embarrassing memory would pop into my head and I'd have to scream/shout/say a random phrase, completely involuntarily, so that it goes away. I recently got an Amazon Echo and I guess I got so used to talking to it, that for about the past week the phrase ""Alexa please"" has been my vocal tic. Of course, my Echo would hear it and respond ""That's so nice, just ask me what you'd like me to do"". Since these verbal tics happen like a dozen times a day or more, I got really annoyed at hearing it from Alexa. So now I have this pavlovian reaction where my mind knows that if I have a verbal tic, my Echo would hear it and respond, which has resulted in these tics being quieter and less frequent than it's ever been.

45,Dear you,"Oh hey, you again.

I thought I would be alone today since yesterday I slept a lot, ate healthy and exerciced; but yet here you are.
Waking up with you is not exactly what I wanted (nor expected), but I guess there is nothing I can do. 

Today you are like my shade again, following me everywhere I go. It does not really matter what I do since you will probably stay with me at least for the rest of the day.

Then I sit in bed and I start planning my day. While other times I could confront you, today I just want to keep myself busy and ignore you. I do not want you to drain my energy, or to drive my mind to that dark place again. 

Your presence made me lose motivation in my studies and the connection I had with my friends already [among many other things] so I do not really understand why you are still here. I mean, what do you want? I think you just want to destroy everything I have, and everything I am. Every day you deteriorate a bit more my identity, thanks to you I am completely lost.

But not today. Because even if you want to, today you will not have the energy to stop me, today it is me who controls you. I know I cannot fight you, but I want you to try and exhaust you until you vanish. Because this is what you deserve. 

So good luck with that, I really want to see you try.

Your owner.",7,2018-03-13 14:55:52 EDT-0400

49,"If you are having trouble with anxiety and you need someone to talk to, feel free to send me a message. I would love it if I could make someone's day or life a bit easier :)","Hi all! Here's a bit about me. I have had severe anxiety and mild depression for the past 4 years and mild anxiety for the previous years of my life. I've been through everything from worrying about basic things, to feeling like I am about to die and being physically unable to leave my room or house without throwing up. 

I know how hard it is to live with and I know living with it can make it hard to talk to others about it. I have been through every single emotion that comes along with anxiety and have learnt so many things along the way, that I think that I can help a lot of you.

So whether you want to talk about something small, something you did, something you are proud of or even just what you are nervous about or how you are feeling, feel free to send me a message. 

No matter how difficult things might seem, we all need a friend and I am just letting you all know I am here if you need some help. I am willing to do this for as long as it takes (whether it be hours, days, months etc.), it's not just 'a next few hours' thing. So if you see this in years to come, I'm probably still here :P

I'm a male from Australia in my early 20's if you would like a bit of context about me.

55,Who else has anxiety about not doing enough with their life?,"To give a brief backstory, I graduated college in Spring 2017 and was still working as a barista at Starbucks. About two months after graduation I started to really feel the effects of my anxiety. I was panicking that I didn’t already have a better job and that I was gonna lose my apartment because I couldn’t pay bills. After relentlessly searching until February 2018, I found a job as a sales rep at a cell phone store. Since February, I’ve been doing great! I’ll be making about $40k a year and after five years of struggling with bills, I can comfortably afford my apartment!

Now, since about April, I’ve been having anxiety, again, about me feeling like I’m not doing enough. I’ve been relaxing a lot, going out to places with friends (because now I can afford it,) and playing a lot of video games(it’s always been a hobby.)  But I’m feeling pressure to go back and get a masters in the hopes of finding a better job and really going for something that I actually dreamed of doing. I just can’t find the will to break away from this relaxed mood the change in pay has given me. Every time I try to give up playing video games and going out with people, in hopes of working towards something, I go right back into this comfortable routine. 

Does anyone else feel this way/get anxiety about this? If so...does it go on forever? Will there ever be a time that I feel fully, 100% relaxed and comfortable with how I’m surviving and doing things that make me happy?",85,2018-07-15 18:20:26 EDT-0400

57,"Hello everyone, just wanted to let you know if you ever need someone to talk to, you can always PM me. I'm here for you, you aren't alone. I've been going through a bit of a rough patch with my anxiety so maybe we can help each other! Love you guys!",,31,2018-07-15 03:44:38 EDT-0400
58,Healing isn’t linear.,"I try to remind myself that healing and learning to live with my thoughts and feelings is a process and sometimes I will backslide and that’s okay.

59,Do you ever get sick of being yourself and wish you could get out of your head for a day?,"I'm so done with me and with everything (NOT suicidal, just pissed off/overwhelmed). I picked a fight with my super nice live-in BF because I don't agree with everything he does politically (even though we agree on like 95% of politics!!!). I wanted to show my POV and usually can do well but I guess am freaked out if we aren't 100% in agreement always. Now he's annoyed with me, and unlike me, he never gets super annoyed with anyone and is pretty even-keel.

I still don't have a job for the upcoming school year (in a VERY tough job market, have two master's degrees, have had a successful teaching career thus far...) and it's making me feel like a loser. I have a second round interview Monday at a school I'm not jazzed about, and I think I'm nervous because I sent in an app to a REALLY good school that just posted an opening shockingly late in the game. So I'm hoping for an interview from them but who knows. My summer teaching job ends soon, so I am not looking forward to being alone with my thoughts.

Anyway, I could tell you why I am annoyed with my BF, but I've had enough therapy to know that a lot of it is more internal than that. I am so annoyed with my damn self. I haven't been to the gym in a week and a half and need to lose weight, and I hate looking in the mirror. Also, I got a haircut that's way too short (still long though haha) and want to barf when I see myself.

Anyway...I just wish I could hide somewhere for a day and be accountable to no one and maybe switch bodies with someone. Thanks for listening haha.

EDIT: Hoooooly shit. Thanks for the upvotes and visibility. You guys rule. I've calmed down about my hair and just got an instant pot and a grill in the past month, so I'm focusing on healthy recipes. And I fought again with my BF about our 5% political differences this morning, but we both spontaneously apologized and cuddled. Still anxious about jobs and found some bad news in my bank statements (rent checks all withdrawn at same time by building management, making me in the red), but I am being uber careful with spending and hoping my summer teaching check does some damage.",26,2018-07-20 17:44:06 EDT-0400

61,A girl I know wrote this beautiful poem about anxiety and it got published,"ROUTINE
 
The first person I say good morning to everyday is my anxiety,
because she’s the only one who sleeps with me every night-
When I finally get out of bed, depression gets me dressed for the day;
I brush my teeth with a nice, big fake smile;
I’m hungry after a long night, but have no time to eat,
so I snack on my nails on my way out the door;
My debt drives me to work and we get caught at every red light;
My boss never has anything nice to say,
she’s always screaming at me before I even arrive;
“Your heart is bad and you're going to die like your dad,”
“You drink too much and don't have an education,”
“Your tattoos make everyone scared of you,”
I’m reminded throughout the day.
Who put her in charge anyway?
It’s the same thing every day I’m noticing my hairs turning grey.
 
My phone rings constantly as it always does,
and I never answer simply because I know who it is,
but this time I pick it up and happiness asks me why we haven’t been in touch-
Her voice doesn’t sound familiar.
 
I sit in my car watching the water swirl and surround me;
My breath is shallow when I open the door; I inhale it all and choke,
I get out anyway and drown on the way to the door as I drag my feet across the floor,
I snap the rubber band across my wrist- it makes her shut up only for a bit.
 
I remember just the other day someone had the nerve to say
stop worrying and your anxiety will go away,
Like it would just lift and disappear like fog and suddenly everything’s clear,
But in reality it’s much more-
See anxiety’s like a long term relationship,
You spend almost every moment together,
you argue, fight and love;
We argue about why it takes so long to get off bed,
Fight about the reoccurring thoughts in our head,
Love the ways we bitch about the world and never have the strength to do anything about it-
You should hear how we talk about ourselves.
 
You can’t do this you can’t do that it’s almost like we took a class.
I had the best teacher,
she knew all my insecurities and worries,
but never bothered to study them thoroughly;
Instead she had questions, and never any new lessons,
She listens but never advises me to change or do anything different.
 
If not medicine, anxiety gave me self discipline,
When I say discipline,
I mean I thought about cutting myself only twice this week;
I haven't done that in years,
I have so many scars now they make a ladder to my insecurities and fears.
I live with monsters under my bed,
and when I say bed, I mean in my head-
They claw my eyes,
Peel my back,
And suddenly this feels more and more like an attack.
 
I wonder when this will be done,
I don’t know how much more I can take-
I’m losing the will to run.
My worst enemy lives with me and knows me better than I know me,
If only I could start over and make them see this wasn’t always me.
It’s only 9 am,
Still sitting in my car,
it was all a dream,
When the day starts,
it feels like its ending.
See this is anxiety,
Monday through Friday like my full time job that I hate
It kills me and I’m still never late.

62,My psychiatrist gave me a very simple tactic to help during panic attacks,"I have severe panic attacks that make me feel like my lungs don’t work, or that my heart is about to explode, and my vision tends to go black for a couple seconds. Because I have a strong educational background in physiology and anatomy, and psychology, I take great comfort in understanding what is happening in my body physiologically during my panic attacks; however, I often feel extremely overwhelmed (obviously) when I am actually having one and struggle with ways to help ride through or calm down. 

My psychiatrist told me that he occasionally has panic attacks, and one thing that really helps him through them is to look at the beds of his fingernails. If they are tinged blue, then he would know that the physical symptoms he was experiencing are resulting from his body actually struggling to breathe, or that his heart was having trouble pumping oxygenated blood to his body. If they aren’t blue, then he knows factually that he isn’t actually dying - his anxiety is just making him feel like he is. This has been a great tool for me, so I figured if anyone else takes comfort in something similar I should share. Anxiety fucking blows, and I hope this helps at least a little bit!",30,2018-07-16 01:43:08 EDT-0400

68,Would you call in sick to work because of your anxiety?,"My anxiety sometimes manifests itself as nausea and vomiting, and for the past couple of weeks it’s been so bad that I’m basically throwing up every day. This morning I woke up about 4:30am feeling extremely anxious and nauseous. I was finally able to get back to sleep at 6am, only to have to wake up and hour later. I feel exhausted, but i feel like it will only make my anxiety worse if I were to call in sick to work today. I guess I’m just asking what your guys’ thoughts are on calling in sick for a mental health day. ",32,2018-07-20 16:47:39 EDT-0400
69,“We all feel that way from time to time” is the most isolating statement,"I am not sure if you all have experienced this but it really drives me nuts. I think it’s quite difficult to openly talk about anxiety and feeling like my issues are worth discussing. When I do end up sharing with a friend or parent, I often get the piece of advice “everyone feels like this” or something along the lines of “well be fortunate it could be worse”

I’m not sure if I’m highly sensitive to this but man does it make me feel so isolated. At that point I regret saying a single word and it makes me question the validity of my anxiety and feelings in the moment.

But for a little while now, when I get caught in a situation I don't want to be in, I don't even feel like myself, becoming just... aggressive. I just snap, it's like flipping a switch, I get confrontational, which I never would have done before. Maybe I'm doing it because I feel it gives me control, even just a little bit. I think my change in personality has been gradual over the years, and I'm worried that I'm just going to turn into someone that I don't want to be.",10,2018-07-19 03:05:31 EDT-0400

76,All that my anxiety is. And this stopped a panic attack in its tracks.,"All that my anxiety is. This is important to note you really need to believe this. You need to know that your anxiety cannot hurt you and your worst fears are only that.  I said all of this aloud when I was having a panic attack over a stupid intrusive thought that I was obsessing over. And for context I've done a ton of therapy and keep to a pretty strict routine to keep myself level... but sometime I slip. I wanted to share what helped me: 


My anxiety, my panic attacks and my phobias are just my body's overreaction to stress. Panic over an intrusive thought does not mean that that thing is more valid, it is just my brain fixating on a fear, my fear of not having control over my wants and needs, my fear of irreversible change. Panic does not mean I want that thing to happen, and it does not mean I will act on these thoughts. All that this is, is my brains capability to blow a random thought into a fear, into an obsession... my brain does not simply let a thought go, it calculates it and sometimes sees it as a threat to my very being. And that's ok. It's just a thought. And thoughts can stay as just that... thoughts are not automatically actions and they are not automatically urges or wants... your brain comes up with nonsense all the time, every day... but if I do not look after my stress levels or care for myself when I've had a trauma, I will panic and my brain will latch on to the nearest fear... and run away with it. My fears are not desires, my fears are not predictions. They are just thoughts. And sometimes thoughts cause anxiety... panic does not validate these thoughts.. it merely makes it easier to obsess, makes it easier to fear your mind. It will pass. You will be fine. It will pass.

85,Badly attacked on another reddit today. Why do i care?,"I’m a pretty stable person. But today I made a meaningless post that was unpopular on a subreddit, (it was about a comedian). The other members went mental and started unloading horrible things on me. People even private msged me bad things. I closed my app, and went in with the day. When I opened it again, my inbox was full of outrageously hateful things. So I went in and deleted my comment. 

But after I deleted, I continued to get msgs. 
Turns out the OP was so excited about the drama, the votes and karma my comment caused, that he’d taken a pic of the original msg and of my profile, and posted it on the subreddit.

I asked him to take it down, at least my personal info. In response, he accused me of being crazy and manic, thus getting what I deserve. 
The pic is gone now. And I banned him from my account. 

This all triggered me. Though I’m not bi-polar, I do have bad anxiety issues, and I was incredibly triggered by all the negativity of the whole incident.  Now I want to delete my whole account. 

This incident is not a big deal, I know it. I get it was the “hive” mentality in action. But I’m triggered for first time in ages. Am I too sensitive for Reddit? 

Does anyone have any skills or advice to calm myself down. I’m crying over this. Should I delete account? Please help me put this into perspective. 

**edit: Thank you everyone for the responses**
In the moment, I felt like it was unmanageable, but I realized it wasn’t important in the big scheme of my life. And considering how much I goodness I have found on subreddits like this one, there’s absolutely no reason to delete my account. I just blocked the people involved, unsubscribed to the subReddit and now I’m forgetting about it!

It had been going well, improving my social skills again by talking to friends and co workers I've been to shy to for months. I felt on top of the world ... which is always a bad thing isn't it as the drop is bigger.

After lunch at work I was relying a message to a coworker who made a snarky remark about whether the message was going anywhere .

97,Minor victories ¯\_(ツ)_/¯,"I was watching a movie with my fiancé tonight when I started feeling tightness in my chest, pain in my left arm, pounding in my head, hot all over, and dizzy. I took some deep breaths, went to lie down for a while, stood out on the balcony to get some cool air, drank some water, and took some more deep breaths. The symptoms didn’t stop, but they did ease a little. We finished the movie, then watched a little tv afterward, with the symptoms insistently nudging into my awareness on and off throughout the night - sometimes better, sometimes worse. I’m still getting some twinges in my back and chest, but now, a few hours later, I’m mostly back to normal. 

A year ago, I’d be in the ER right now. I’d have started crying, saying I felt like I was dying, and my fiancé would have asked me (in a very supportive tone, but with not even a hint of truly believing I was actually in any danger, because he’s a rational guy and this would not have been the first, or second, or even fifth time this had happened) if I wanted to go to the hospital. I would have sobbed “no, I know it’s probably nothing,” followed eventually by “I don’t knooooooow though, I really feel terrible...” and I would’ve gone back and forth in that manner for anywhere from 5 to 30 minutes. I would have eventually said “better safe than sorry,” and my poor fiancé would have gamely driven me to the hospital, waited with me, sat with me while I got an EKG, waited patiently for me while I got a chest x-ray, then listened patiently with me while a kindly doctor let me know my heart was fine and that I was having a panic attack. I would of course know this by this point, as the attack would have run its course and I would feel fine (though embarrassed) at some point during one of the waits in the little curtained-off room. 

So I’d get a Xanax or 3 and be sent home, having lost a few hours and several hundred dollars. 

But not tonight! I forced my rational side to win this time. I didn’t google any symptoms (what would be the point, really? I’ve memorized all the top search results by now), but I did review what I knew. The chest pain wasn’t constant. It moved around a little. It was sharp, not dull, achey, or pressure-y. I’m getting over a cold, so the fact that the extra pounding in my head seemed focused around my sinuses probably had more to do with that than with an impending stroke. And if the worst did happen, I wasn’t home alone. If I lost consciousness, my fiancé would get me help. If my heart stopped, the hospital is 5 minutes away, an ambulance would be here in no time. 

Now, of course, I’m struggling with thoughts like, “But what if I ignore it like this when it actually IS a heart attack, or a stroke? My efforts to be rational and not to overreact are eventually going to kill me!” But even those thoughts don’t bother me like they used to. They might again someday, because this condition for me is episodic and comes in waves. I’ll be fine for a year, or two, or five, and then be a wreck for no reason for a month, or a year, or longer. But right now, I’m good, and that feels awesome.

99,I only feel happy when he talks to me,"This has been a recurring pattern in my life. I find somebody who makes me feel good about myself and then when they start to pull away or just place me further down in their list of priorities, I feel incredibly anxious and depressed. I worry I'm not good enough for them or they've found someone better. This has happened with partners and friends throughout my life. I've always been attached to one particular person at a time.

Most recently, it has been this guy. We weren't exactly in a relationship but we did have a friends with benefits thing going on for  a while. It was clear he wasn't ready for a real relationship so we decided to just remain friends. I guess I became reliant on his company and he was someone I felt I could be myself around. 

Only recently he's been so busy with his life, I've barely heard from him and it's unsettling. He went weeks without contacting me and I was getting really anxious and depressed. But earlier today, I finally heard from him and I instantly felt so much happier. I could tell my mood lifted because I was dancing and singing round the house and it felt so good. I really wish I could feel like that without depending on others, but it was just like an instant reflex to his communication.

As I was speaking to him, I realised he wasn't that special and I shouldn't feel too reliant on his company, but at the same time I felt happier than I'd been for weeks. I felt like finally I can be myself again. Why can't I feel like that around everyone? Why is it only certain people I allow to see my happiness? Why is it when certain people distance themselves from me I turn into an anxious wreck and I can't focus on anything?

102,Guys—for the first time in my life I stopped a panic attack before it started.,"I felt my panic attack coming on while on my way to a talk at a recent conference I attended. It always starts with vertigo for me, and quickly leads into feelings of fear, claustrophobia, and the inability to catch my breath. Usually, the second I feel that dizziness hit I know there’s no stopping the panic attack that follows it. I hole up in the nearest bathroom stall and resign myself to riding it out, a process that can take hours and often results in DAYS of constant vertigo afterwards.

I felt it coming on as I was headed to the talk, but it was a talk I was really interested in so I was like “oh no you don’t!” I focused my mind on some mindfulness techniques i learned in therapy—namely, the technique of observing my surroundings closely and mentally taking note of them (there is a red backpack in the corner, the man next to me is wearing black shoes, one of his shoelaces is untied, the room smells a little bit like sweat, etc) and GUESS WHAT. For the first time EVER, without medication, I got the panic attack under control. And I was able to enjoy the talk and get a lot out of it!

I’m so proud of myself, you guys. I had to share because I want you all to know that even if you’ve been struggling for years, there ARE mental techniques that can help keep panic attacks from hitting. We can do this! We don’t have to be anxiety’s bitch! And that’s the best feeling in the entire world.",74,2018-07-10 09:00:59 EDT-0400

110,I started working last Tuesday after a 5 year break. Im 25.,"Long story short, I started working when I was still in school, completely my choice, I was 17. Worked for about 2.5 years. Off the books, cash in hand. I quit to move to the city hoping to get a better job. I didnt. I was stuck there for 4 years. Trapped in a toxic house with an abusive couple. I was agoraphobic. I couldnt save myself because it got the stage where I thought I deserved to be treated like that. Everything got worse, the anciety, depression, insomnia. Thought about killing myself daily. Fast forward 4 years, landlord decides to sell the house. Ohshitimgoingtobehomeless. My parents rescued me. Didnt even ask lol
A year at home meant I ate 3 proper meals a day, that I cook for myself. Before I was living on porridge because I was below the poverty line. I started walking the dog 3.5km every other day atleast. I was sleeping better, eating better, wasnt touchstarved anymore. I started seeing a counsellor. Hes the only one who properly listens to me. Even if I talk pure nonsense for an hour, it helps. He says I shouldv seen someone years ago. Well duh lol
I have a lot of repressed trauma, years of blanks. I struggle a lot with how empathetic I am. Far too sensitive. Never seen it as a hoft like others do.


Anyways, good news though. Iv started working in a day centre. I get myself up for work every morning, I have breakfast, I throw up from nerves, I make myself presentable, I walk to work. Its only my 6th day tomorrow but Im getting into the swing of things I think. I finished all the morning tasks 30 minutes into my shift this morning and one of the other women acknowledged it. Its....strange being praised. Im not used to it at all. One of the men even said I have a pleasant disposition. Its weird ya know. I mean Iv never been confident or had good self-esteem. I have been given out to aswell, doing something the wrong way or at the wrong time. Iv even been told off for things I know somebody else, more experienced did. I work part-time and we dont have set breaks because you kind of have to work around things. It took 3 days before my boss realised I hadnt taken any lol She told me she'd make me take them aha. Kinda weird aswell. I kinda feel stupid taking breaks. Idk. I suppose Iv to get used to it.

Anyways, this is just, an update, since Iv posted before. Two steps forward, one step back. Slowly making progress. Im veing properly adulty again, took me long enough hah!

I wish you all the best on your own journey x",21,2018-07-10 22:05:41 EDT-0400

115,A tip from my therapist: “It’s not YOUR anxiety. It’s THE anxiety.”,"Like many of you, I’ve been pretty much crying myself to sleep every night. Sometimes I don’t even know why. Hell, most of the time I don’t even know why. I feel like I destroy relationships around me. A few moments ago I frantically went through my contacts to see if there was someone who I could call, and I didn’t know who. So I sat there at work and just found a moment to turn around after smiling all day, and just burst out into tears mumbling “I want to go home”. I don’t even know what that meant. Even if I went to my house, it’s not like it would go away. My boyfriend is in Japan for a while, which is dangerous because if I get a bad episode, it’s really easy to mass text (via “line”) my problem. And I don’t even know what my “problem” is. It’s even worse being raised a Christian, and being one by choice, because most of the Christian advice is to just “let go and let God”. Then I beat myself up and feel like a failure, because I can’t “let go and let God”.

My closest childhood friend in the world who’s like a brother to me is soon to die from cancer. You know what’s fucked up? Anxiety feels worse than my sadness for my dying brother. 10x worse.

I would constantly make it a part of me.

My anxiety is tearing my relationships apart.
My anxiety is causing me to lose my mind.
My anxiety sometimes makes me want to kill myself. I want my anxiety to stop. It’s all my fault.

My therapist taught me to say *the* anxiety. It’s not my anxiety. Anxiety does not define who I am. Anxiety is not the first thing everyone notices about me, even if I’m convinced it is. I am actually a very strong, sassy, stubborn person. *The* anxiety is a clinical condition that simply comes in and tries to take over who I already am. *The* anxiety is more manageable than I think, because one of my more defining qualities is strength. It doesn’t belong to me. Some days it feels stronger than other days, but it’s not mine and I refuse to let it linger.

Why can't I enjoy alone time without thinking of things I haven't got done, why can't I watch a Film or TV show without thinking about work the next day, why can't I go for a walk without being anxious and suspecting everyone, why can't I go to the shop without having to psych myself up beforehand, why can't I answer a ringing phone without always expecting the worst. Why can't I just go to sleep without thinking about my whole life story for hours.

120,My therapist said the nicest thing about my anxiety,"When we were discussing how I didn't like having anxiety, my therapist tells me, ""The very fact that you are more sensitive to people and things than others may not necessarily be a bad thing.

It was an interesting perspective. Although my anxiety is difficult, I don't feel reduced to my anxiety anymore. I've just accepted it to be a part of me which I have to work on. ",18,2018-07-13 06:44:53 EDT-0400
121,"I almost killed myself right now, right at work","I just came back from the highway. I just took my lunch time to walk right there crying like a crazy person.

I was so afraid. I knew I would die. 

In the way, I found I broken glass and cut my hand open. Feeling the blood rush through my arm was horrible. When I finally reached the highway, I started crying so hard. I felt scared and sad. In the way, I called my parents, my best friend and my pshychologists and I said goodbye to all of them. They coulnd't understand what happened or what I would do.

I told my parents ""everything will be allright now. everything will come back to normal""

But I didn't kill myself. Today. I'm scared I will still do it. 

Instead, I'm back at my table at work, writing this. My arm full of my dry blood. Everything as it was before. Nobody knows. Nobody cares. Nobody will ever now.

I'm also trying to study for my GRE exams and I look forward to the weekends when I can really put in a lot of hours for this, but I am finding that with the anxiety surrounding work even when I am studying its not productive because my mind is somewhere else. I am frustrated with myself because during the week I study less (try to get in 1.5-2 hours most days) because I am exhausted at the end of the day so the weekends should be my time to dedicate to this. I kinda wanted to self care this weekend since I know these next few weeks will be emotionally taxing, but at the same time I feel like since I know I will be expending my mental energy on work that means I SHOULD be studying as much as possible this weekend. I cant win, I'm so nervous I cant truly relax and self care, if I dont study I feel lazy and I know my time is ticking before my exam comes up, but if I do study I dont feel like I'm able to work/absorb information at my full capacity.

I started Prozac for anxiety/depression about 2 1/2 weeks ago (20 mg) and it’s completely changed my routine for the worst - it makes me sleepy 24/7, it’s taken away all of my motivation, made my anxiety worse on some days (like right now), etc. Now, because I haven’t slept good all night, my anxiety is making me worry that I’m gonna accidentally fall asleep during the hours that I’m supposed to be working on top of the general anxiety that I’m just gonna flat out suck at this new job.

I have a new plan for post grad, but that doesn't fix this semester. I used to average low A's, and while I did procrastinate and didn't always study enough, I was doing alright. This semester though, I'm taking 4 classes (+labs)- I have A's in 2, a solid C in one of the harder ones, which I don't mind, and I'm on the very low and dangerous end of a C in the last one. The problem with the last one is that I struggle pay attention in class, get behind, don't have good notes to study, get super anxious and/or panic while studying, and then just don't study. I go into quizzes and exams unprepared and left the most recent one crying. 
I'm currently in therapy, and am actively seeking a psychiatrist. I take an ssri, as well as cbd when I feel very anxious/am panicking (the whole lack of psychiatrist thing has led to self medication. Not ideal, but I don't know what else to do). 
I'm looking for advice on how to make myself study, or how to stay focused during class. This is mostly just until I can figure out medications, but the psychiatrist search process hasn't been super productive, despite numerous phone calls.

159,Unexplainable sudden depression and headache,"Just about an hour ago, I started to feel really bad for no reason. Like reasonably fine to the worst sudden depression with a bad headache. I had to tell my friend to leave my place and now I'm laying in bed feeling weird.

I'm not sure if this is a migraine or a panic attack/depressive episode or what. My head hurts on the very top and it hurts to think. Usually I have an aura with migraines though.

My friend and I were looking at a house to move into in a small town earlier today, which was mildly anxiety inducing. Also earlier today I had breakfast tea, then yerba mate with my friend, so I'm wondering if maybe I'm suffering from too much caffeine. I pretty much just would like to know that I'll feel normal again. Really terrified at the moment.",0,2018-12-08 03:52:34 EST-0500
160,Should I stay or leave my anxiety inducing first job?,"I’ve recently started my first ever job at a pretty well known retail chain (which I won’t mention the name of because my experience does not represent every store nor do I want to tarnish its name in any way) and it has been an overall horrible experience destroying my mental health. 

For a little background I’m an 18 year old female with anxiety. 

I started this job with no experience in retail, my sister having helped me apply and get in. Whilst going in to do paperwork before starting I wasn’t given any contact details for managers or the store. These were given to me by my sister, a manager at another store, after telling her I was never given anything. My first ever shift—which I must mention I was never notified of the date, again I found this out due to my sister—consisted of me being thrown in the deep end. I was put on with nobody in my department and given a rough 5min tour of the areas I need to look after and then left alone with a small introduction to what I was to do. I was very under prepared. I didn’t see the manager once that whole time, nor was I checked up on by people regularly. It was just me alone confused and lost for the entire 5 hour shift. I was never introduced to the people I work with or given a proper tour involving departments and or where things are I was just left alone. I have still, 3 weeks, later never been put on with someone in my department to teach me how to do things or properly ‘trained’ (which will come into play later. I have again not been told of things that seem rather important to know such as the morning meeting I was unaware of and how to get in to the store before retail hours and when exact these hours start.

I’ve had approximately 5 break downs already from the stress of it. The work I do isn’t significantly hard—expect for the strain on my muscles from moving heavy boxes—just processing stock and putting it out on the floor. I think it’s more emotionally draining than it is physically, as I have to suppress my emotions back until I get home and my mind is always on alert. It’s become a question of whether I want to continue feeling this way and stay or quit and in my parents words “give up”. 

If I leave I’m putting my sister in a bad position because it was her that helped me get this job. She and my parents have said the store has put in time and money to train me but it doesn’t feel this way considering my experience. If I leave I’m leaving the store a staff down during the Christmas season. If I leave my parents think I’m giving up despite what they say about the decision being up to me. They think that this will set a pattern of me running away from stressful situations. If I stay I am miserable and the pain I have caused them from being unhappy will more than likely continue. I’ve worn them down they have said, that they can’t keep seeing me like this or doing this. I’m so lost and I just don’t know what to do. I am so emotionally drained from not just this but school being over and having my life ahead of me I just don’t have the means of communicating how I feel and identifying the reasons for why I feel this way. 

I understand anxiety is fuelling my thoughts and the underlying reason for my reaction to this but it’s not like I can shut it off at anytime, it’s a constant I just and have had to live with. I don’t know what to do, whether to stay in this job or leave. Has anyone had a similar experience to this or advice as to what I should do?

177,"It took me over two months to get over my new job anxiety, now being there makes my days better and more productive. Keep pushing through the anxiety and show up, consistency works wonders.","I started my new job in August. Between the months of August and November I called in sick at least twice a week. 

I would stay up all night thinking about waking up early the next day. I would lose hours of sleep at night and end up falling asleep an hour before I had to get up again. I would find myself anxious that I wasn’t getting enough sleep and call in “sick” to work just to sleep the day away. This left me feeling more anxious, with thoughts  that I was disappointing my co workers and supervisors. Knowing I would have to call my parents up and explain why I didn’t go to work this week and that I didn’t have enough money for the electric that month. 

My anxiety often gets me to the point where I wake up with the sudden urge to run to the toilet to throw up. I’ve thrown up almost everyday for the past five years. Thus calling in sick again. 

It’s a viscous cycle 

Ive been following this sub closely since my anxiety had been at an all time high and I was spending a lot of time on my phone. I saw a post that somehow put it into perspective for me, I wish I would have saved it but it explained my situation and anxieties perfectly and I decided that in order to get over the work anxiety I have, I just need to fucking go to work. I told my boyfriend who held me more accountable, he would know if I didn’t go to work and I gave him permission to call me on my bullshit.

I started showing up everyday. If I was sick in the morning, I would tell myself “if I still feel sick an hour into work, I will let my supervisor know I must leave.” 

I didn’t leave sick from work once. I began to realize that I am needed at work, and that my anxiety was normal. I was working with a new group of people at a new place. I wasn’t adjusted and now that I gave my workplace a chance, I genuinely feel better and more accomplished when I get to go to work for the day. 

This is not to say to keep a shitty job even if it makes you feel anxious or depressed. This career is something I’ve always wanted, I just didn’t understand why showing up to work made me so anxious. 

Don’t give up on that job, give it some time. You could just be adjusting and you may be one of your company’s most valued employees in a few months. ",3,2018-12-22 19:21:30 EST-0500

Anxiety Relapse Time


I haven’t had a string of panic attacks since January 2017. 

But now, that little weasel is poking its head up, once more...

I just started taking Prozac again. Two more weeks until the effects start. 

But I’m fearful that a possible relapse could set me back two years of progress. Two years of getting my life wrapped around the demons that torment me and in spite of them, moving forward. 

Have you relapsed? If so, please let me know how it went and how (if) you overcame it.

188,"Anyone else feel the same, at least almost?........Always noticing every little physical feeling that changes in my body; scared of having a heart attack and not even noticing","Slight trigger warning: one short mention of bl**d






My anxiety has been worsening over the years, despite me having a good life. I have friends, a boyfriend, and a loving and caring family. School isn’t too stressful but sometimes the atmosphere can be overwhelming.

Lately, especially for the past few days, I’ve been very focused on every little physical change in my body. Heart-rate, whether or not my stomach is aching, etc.

Right now my arms feel weak and numb. They felt like that on the way home from a movie. The whole time during the movie I felt mildly uncomfortable and was ready to go home. When I got in the car, that’s when I started feeling that weak and slightly achy feeling in my arms. Sometimes my left shoulder will hurt a little, or even both shoulders.

I went to the doctor recently and they didn’t seem to find anything wrong. I’ve been to the hospital twice, once they tested my blood and didn’t find anything wrong, they said I was fine and they did all this because I hadn’t taken my medicine in a few days and had felt bad the next morning having not taken it. So I basically got a little checkup while I was there. Another time they used a halter monitor(?) to monitor my heartbeat but during that time I don’t remember if I had any anxiety attacks or not so they didn’t catch anything on the monitor.

I can’t help but think, “What if the doctors are wrong? What if there’s something wrong with me? What if it’s not just anxiety but something else? I don’t have a very good diet, but sometimes it’s fine, what if it’s that? If it IS my anxiety then why are these symptoms like weakness just coming out of nowhere, even if I’m totally calm?”

Does anyone else feel the same? Honestly just need some support right now. I feel like things aren’t going to get better.

Recently I've been dealing with a lot more latent anxiety than normal. I've struggled with it for years, but over the last few weeks there have been a lot of days where I've spent the entire time with a pit in my stomach. It's weird - I'll wake up feeling totally fine, then the moment I realize I'm not feeling any anxiety, it's like a switch flips and I just start accumulating it right then and there. What the hell is up with this? I'm not even having thoughts about anything specific while it builds up, it's just like I can't stop something that my brain has decided is normal. 

I think this started while I was having a rough time with a friend recently. That situation has since been resolved, but the pattern of this gnawing feeling has stayed.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

After my therapist practically begged me to find a job for the last year, I finally applied and was hired at Kroger.

This is huge for me. Anxiety keeps me from doing almost anything scary, and this was terrifying. I had no idea I was even going to be interviewed today. I called a phone number they had for phone interviews, and next thing I know I'm going to a store to do an in-person interview (and my first one at that). I had no idea when I woke up today that I was going to be interviewing anywhere, let alone being hired.

I've been trained on how to do a proper job interview, but that was a few months ago. I forgot almost everything I learned and just went in and suffered through it. The manager was very kind and forgiving, and ultimately I didn't do too badly (I did get the job, after all).

I'm working in produce. The job won't be hard, but I'm afraid my anxiety is going to get in the way and cause me to freak out if I don't know exactly what I'm doing.

Regardless, this is big. My anxiety usually keeps from accomplishing anything significant in life, so I'm kind of proud of myself.",63,2018-09-10 22:23:32 EDT-0400

No one is harassing me here and my boss hasn’t given me any real criticism yet. But any time I make a mistake it’s like a punch to the gut and it sends me in a spiral thinking I’m worthless and I will never be good at any job. I have a LOT of medical debt and if I lost my job my life would be ruined as I feel like I haven’t even been able to have a real career yet and I’m 31 and only had these three jobs. 


Idk what to do. I am a constant ball of stress because of work. It seeps into my weekends too and I feel the toll on my body.

I’ve talked to three therapists so far about this, and although I’ve come a long way no one has been able to remove this fear from me. Is it just always going to be like this??

Does anyone else struggle with this?

My job is very detail oriented and everyone in my field it seems are also perfectionists which doesn’t help. I have no idea if I’m making a normal amount of mistakes.

219,"Hey you. You with the anxiety- I dont know you, but I care <3","I won't tell you one of the  worst things every person with anxiety hates to hear (""Calm Down""), but what I will suggest is to stop those negative thoughts you're having - just for one second. 

I know it seems almost impossible to quit worrying about what you may have said wrong at work, school or anywhere, the other day. I know it's hard to let go of a mistake that may have embarrassed you in front of your coworkers/crush/public. It may seem like your mistake is the talk of the town, right?

But you need to remember that EVERYONE makes mistakes and has made mistakes before. Before joining this subreddit, I thought all of my issues weren't common, but I was wrong and this was so freaking comforting knowing there's  other people just like me.  Its okay to mess up from mistakes, you'll always learn from them - sometimes harsh lessons but at other times, precious and life changing ones. I'm sure you can at least name a few experiences.

To make you feel better:

One of my somewhat iconic mistakes:

I once ran into a locked door in front of 200 people waiting in line for a concert and fell so hard on my butt. I was the only one in the middle of the room, might I add.  Security got up from their chairs and started walking towards me like I was some crazed psychopath, and I just pretended to pick up my phone, look at the blank screen and walk away - LOL. I can't count how many times I've pretended to be on my phone/check a text.

Honestly, after that happened, I locked myself in my room and cried my eyes out vowing to never ""be so stupid and embarrassing again.""

People laughed at me that day, but hell, I'd laugh too if that was someone else 😂 (after making sure they're ok of course!).

And now reminiscing about that today, only makes me sad.. that I was so hard on myself. 

Oh man, the things I said to myself after that happened.. definitely heartbreaking. 

It was a mistake. And that's all I needed to tell myself. That's all I should have told myself. 

I also thought:

Why do I put strangers on a pedestal when I'm certain I'm never going to see them again? Why do I try so hard to get someone's approval when I know they wouldn't do the same? Better yet.. why do I sacrifice my mental health and well-being just to live up to someone else's standards and not my own?


Sorry for the rant here..

But if there's anyone who is taking their anxiety out on themselves for being:

Too quiet

Too weird

Too nice

Not fitting in with today's norms

Then I have a suggestion for you:

Stop living for someone else. Take a moment to stop and thank yourself for how far you've come. Then take another moment, to get to know..you. Go do that thing you've always enjoyed doing, go say what was in your mind and stop rephrasing it 1,000 times over. 

Coming from someone with major anxiety, You are just as valuable as the person you're bending over backwards for.

238,Anybody else ever feel like their entire world is crumbling right in front of you?,"**Edit**: THANK YOU ALL for your absolute kindness and empathy. I’m touched, really. I really wasn’t expecting as big of response to this as it got, but I’m truly appreciative, as reading these comments and just knowing how I’m feeling isn’t completely abnormal really helped a lot. You all are 100% the best and I just thank you guys so much. ❤️

Tl;dr: I just feel like life is changing so much in my 20s that everything I know is just kind of disappearing. It’s freaking me out. Anybody else ever felt like this?

First, sorry for the long post. I was hoping it would come out shorter, but my brain’s kind of a blubbery mess right now.

Lately I [24M] just feel like a lot is wrong in my life. Especially tonight, I just feel super sad and lonely, but it’s a long time coming I think. Anything that’s constant in my life I feel like is disappearing, and it has me really scared kind of.

Currently I’m off with my mom, 1000 miles away from home, while we finish the ripping apart of my grandparents’ household of 50+ years. Long story short, my grandfather died in May 2016, and turns out my step grandmother didn’t give a crap about him or anyone else; she just wanted his money. So since he died, between battling with her and the trustee of the estate (a formerly trusted family accountant), it’s been a painful experience watching the house where I spent summers for the past 24 years be ripped apart. I loved my (real) grandmother, and I really really loved my grandfather and identified with him so much, and it’s just been so hard. So that’s gone.

My last remaining grandparent is my dad’s mom who lives close to me. She’ll be 80 this June, so she’s getting older as well. Because she lived nearby and my parents have full time jobs, she (and my dad’s dad when he was alive) kept me and my sister a lot when we were kids, and she’s always been a big part of my life. Also, my dad’s sister/my aunt has always been kind of crazy, but lately she’s become really insane (super super religious, her emotions are out of control towards other family members, says some really off the wall stuff, rambles for 2-3 hours when I talk to her, etc.), so she’s not the same aunt I used to be close with.

I’m having doubts about being with my girlfriend of 3 years. Some days I wake up and I love her like crazy, some moments she does some things (occasional emotional abuse, acting like a child to get her way, loves to play the blame game about small things, etc.) that make me wonder why I’m still with her. Our sex life is also pretty horrific. So that’s a constant emotional roller coaster that makes me feel ungrounded.

I’m currently in a PhD I dislike. I love my fellow students (about 8 of us), thank god, but the actual program is soul draining. I do not like it at all, but don’t know what else to do.

I have some anxiety issues that make me doubt (and kind of hate) myself. Like summer 2016 I had a couple minor panic attacks and have since developed mild-moderate agoraphobia and fear of having more panic. It seems to wax and wane. Sometimes I feel like I cope with it awesomely; sometimes I feel so crippled by it I wonder how I’ll ever function enough to get through life and how anybody can love someone as broken as me. The panic in particular is something that is relatively new, so it’s been hard adjusting to it.

(Note: I do see a therapist and have been for depression and anxiety for some time, so I am getting professional help)

I also have some mild-moderate social anxiety which I feel makes it hard for me to connect with people sometimes. My social skills are good (I used to work at an Apple store where I was hired specifically for my social skills) so I know I’m capable. Just the thought of having to make smalltalk sometimes though makes me want to run the other way and isolate myself.

Also, I became dependent inadvertently on tranquilizers prescribed (in a reckless fashion) by a psychiatrist. Coming off of those was pretty horrific, which didn’t help anything. That was 5 years ago.

I just believe my 20s are kind of a complete disaster, and all of the constants in my life I feel like are disappearing before my eyes. I’m ready to feel stable and grounded again, and it’s just scary feeling like everything in my life that I know and love is just slipping away.

Anyone else ever feel like this?

American Teenagers
Than Ever Suffering
From Severe Anxiety?](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/11/magazine/why-are-more-american-teenagers-than-ever-suffering-from-severe-anxiety.html()**


**Summary of points made in the article:**


According to the NIMH anxiety is the most common mental health disorder in
the United States, effecting 1/3 of adolescents and adults.

Over 10 years anxiety has overtaken depression as the most common reason
colleges students seek out counseling service.  There has been a doubling
of hospital admissions for suicidal teenagers, with the highest rates
correlating with the return to school.

According to the experts in the article anxiety can be defined as the 
overestimation of danger and the underestimation of the ability to cope.
Anxiety is about the avoidance of uncertainty and discomfort.

Teenagers from rich families suffered from anxiety as much as teenagers from
poor families.   The sources of anxiety for poor teenagers were neighborhoods
with violence & poverty, and abusive families.  Overall, anxiety among teenagers
seemed to be about fear of failure, fear of being judged, and a feeling of
being overwhelmed.  Many felt like they could never get to the point where
they could say ""I've done enough, I can stop"".  The researchers interviewed
said it was not completely about helicopter parents.  Teenagers are now
internalizing their parents' worries, driving themselves crazy with their
own thoughts.

Though initially reluctant to do so, researchers had to place a portion of
the blame on the rise of social media and technology like smart phones after
research showed a high correlation.   Social media makes anxiety worse by
teenagers constantly comparing themselves to their peers.  Smart phones
provide both a source of anxiety and a source of avoidance.  Avoidance makes
anxiety worse.

The use of smart phones provide an illusion of control and certainty.  Teenagers
never learn to face risks and adapt to interactions that do not turn out
as hoped.

Exposure therapy as a component of cognitive therapy has been shown to be
the most effective treatment, even more so when combined with appropriate
antidepressants.

Avoidance makes anxiety worse, which gives parents the dilema of not being
sure when to push their children to face their problems and when to give 
them space.

Parents and schools of been failing on the side of giving teenagers too
much space.  Teenagers have been getting the dangerous message that they
can not handle being triggered and that they should not have to face things
in their environment that make them uncomfortable.

257,Today I got a haircut,"“The best time to plant a tree was 20 years ago. The second best time is today.” My new favorite quote

I know anxiety cripples all of us, but if we can accomplish one simple task that we’ve been putting off, it’s one stop closer to recovery.

Today, I got a haircut. I made excuses for months and kept cancelling my appointments. I finally just went and did it and feel 10x better about myself

I have faith in all of you that you can do one thing that anxiety is telling you not to do.

Love and peace :)",28,2018-05-12 19:11:11 EDT-0400
258,"Drove to a bar, couldn't find a door, got to nervous, stress puked, cried the drive home.","Pretty much what it says. Idk if I am posting for some support or what but god do I feel stupid. 

I drove to this pub where my friend works. Never been there before. It was part of some sports center and there were soccer games going on the outdoor fields. 

I didn't know how to get into the bar and was concerned my wrap shirt and jeans were over dressed. 

I texted my friend asking for help. The soccer people started looking at me. I got really nervous and puke out of the jeep door. And then get. Even more nervous and drove off. 

The whole ordeal was about 15 minutes and I cried the whole way home. I feel like such a fucking loser. I never used to be like this. I don't go out and clearly have bad anxiety. Thought I had worked up the nerve. Guess not. 

Edit: I am also autistic, fairly high functioning but the social anxiety stems from that. ",57,2018-05-13 08:40:51 EDT-0400

260,Well it finally happened...,"My girlfriend and I have been living together for about two months now so I figured it would only be a matter of time until she witnessed one of my night terror/panic attacks. She knows I suffer from anxiety but I don't think she knows the severity and what a wreck I can become in the midst of a freak out. Last night I had doozie of a panic attack accompanied with all the bells and whistles (gagging, pacing, whimpering). I'm sure I freaked her out as this was all happening at 2 in the morning. She woke up and without missing a beat handed me some water and started rubbing my back, and it helped a lot. Anxiety sucks, but god damn am I lucky to have my girlfriend to help me.

262,"Proud of myself, even if it was just a baby step.","I was hired 8 months ago at a health facility. I turned down a promotion for a management position because of my social anxiety and performance anxiety and panic attacks. Today I walked to the front and asked for an application for an opening higher position after repeatedly telling myself I’m not good enough, I’m under qualified, I’ll be rejected, I’ll be judged, I won’t pass the interviews. I pushed through those thoughts and I received the application. I’m proud of myself just for asking, just for choosing to ignore those thoughts and choosing me, not letting anxiety destroy my possibilities or what ifs in my life. The application is sitting on my desk, tomorrow I will fill it out. The hard part- walking to the executive director and handing it to him. The thoughts will repeat through my head, my heart will race, and I will try to push through and explain why I’m good enough for the position. The truth is I know I’m good enough, I know I’m qualified, I know I can do it, but the anxiety that comes with proving yourself, possible rejection or judgement is overwhelming for me. But I am just so proud of this baby step, I want to make more.",12,2018-05-13 06:46:12 EDT-0400
263,Watched a suicide of a stranger,"On Thursday, I was at a hotel and was the only witness to someone jumping off the parking gargae. I did all the right things, called 911, told the hotel, checked on the body, gave a police report.  I didn’t see the open head wounds, but I saw from his chest down, the body was swollen and the arms and legs weren’t bent in ways they shouldn’t have been. 

I have no clue how to go on now. It’s all I think about, I don’t want to sleep, I worry that I didn’t do enough, like maybe if I ran faster, I could have saved him. I went and looked at his car on the top of the parking garage and it looks like a car your average 20 something would drive. 

I just don’t know how to move on. I already suffer from anxiety and depression. 


Edit: I worked all day at that hotel for my meeting Friday. Today I did some stuff with my mom, but as soon as I stop moving, I feel right back in those moments. I’m sure I’m not very clear in this description. ",23,2018-05-12 23:17:46 EDT-0400

They don't have to worry about social interactions, or deadlines, or responsibilities, or how much of a disappointment they are. They don't have to worry about just building up the willpower to do anything other than mindlessly browsing the internet. I wish everything weren't a struggle, I wish I could just never have to worry about any of this again. I love the beauty of the world, and I don't want to kill myself.

267,Someone shouted that I was ugly as I crossedthe street and I didn’t let it consume me the way it would have six months ago,"I don’t live in a very nice place. I’m fact, it’s very toxic for POC. So, I do have some anxiety on top of my normal anxiety about going outside. 

I went outside today, after fluffing my curly, big hair, putting on eyeliner, and my favorite chapstick. I started walking to a coffee shop I like. 

I knew things could get nasty when the car that I walked past a stoplight took negative interest in me. I could feel their gaze on me as I continued to walk, and they shouted at me as they drove off. 

A month ago even I would have gone into an anxiety and rage spiral at this. I KNOW that I’m not ugly, and I know why they did what they did, happiness and self love can sometimes attract the nastiest opposites of that and hateful people will target people if they think they can.

I don’t like the place that I live, but it’s been easier to get my self esteem to a better place lately. I don’t wanna feel badly anymore even though my GAD will always be a part of my life. ",27,2018-05-12 01:14:59 EDT-0400

269,Does your anxiety make you nauseous?,"Things started around a year and a half ago with some major job changes, and while have had anxiety, it seemed to only get worse.

About a year ago I started to get nauseous. It started at 1 time every few weeks, the 1-2 a week, and pretty much on a daily basis. I could eat or not, didn't matter. Only eat bread, nausea. Try soup, nausea. You get the idea.

I thought it might actually be a digestive issue. Underwent multiple tests, nothing. Had my blood work done, only thing off is my vitamin D levels.

If I catch it early enough I can usually take a Xanax and head it off before it gets too terrible, but sometimes it still persists. I also take lamictal for bipolar.

I hate being dependent on Xanax, but I'm at a loss for what else to do. I'm hoping life is finally starting to settle down and maybe some of this will pass.

277,Is it normal to have fun while drinking then feel depressed and over-analyse everything you did when you sober up?,"Hi guys, i know alcohol is a 'depressant' but I just thought that meant you become more depressed when you drink it, not after.
Anyway, I can only really come out of my shell once I'm drunk, I'm pretty bad at introducing myself to people unless I am wasted, so alcohol is pretty essential to my way of life I suppose.
But when I finish drinking, oh boy do I worry too much. For example, last night I was drinking with my friends and everything was going brilliantly but now I'm really worried about what kinda impression I gave to some people and whether or not I said something offensive. I know I at least blew my chance to get some action last night but that's ok, there are bigger issues at hand. I also worry I bring up my issues too much and bring the whole atmosphere down.

302,Swallowing anxiety when sleeping next to someone,"Hello r/anxiety: long time lurker, first time poster. Really struggling so any advice is welcome.   
This may seem odd, but there's something that's been bothering me for a few months now. I'm in my early 20s and only recently started dating. The first time I spent the night with a guy I became very self conscious when it came to cuddling and trying to fall asleep. I became very self aware. My every movement and every breath was suddenly very noticeable to me. At one point I swallowed and my swallow just seemed so loud - kind of like a mini gulp. Anyway, after I did that I couldn't stop thinking about swallowing, which resulted in me continuously having the urge to swallow. I know how strange this sounds, but please don't judge.   


Now every time I spend the night with a guy I worry about this happening. I feel like my swallows are very audible. Especially because it's an anxiety induced swallow. Natural swallowing isn't as loud, but if you're swallowing because you're hyper focused on it, then A) you swallow more frequently, and B) the swallows become more audible since they are, in a way, forced swallows. I feel really ridiculous typing this, but please understand that this is an actual issue for me. I no longer want to date, and if I meet someone I'm genuinely interested in I start to get sad because I think nothing can ever come of it since I'll be so anxious when we share a bed.   


This isn't as bad during the day if said guy and I are watching tv or something because the sound of the TV will tune out my swallowing, and also because I'm more easily distracted. For example, the task at hand (like the show we're watching or our conversations) will distract me from my constant swallowing. However, when you're just lying there next to someone trying to sleep there's nothing there that can serve as a distraction or tune you out...I dated this one guy for a month, and we shared a bed a total of 8-10 times, and I couldn't fall asleep AT ALL any of those nights. Even when he was asleep I was still so tightly wound from my anxiety that I couldn't shut my mind off. 

&#x200B;

I think the best solution would be acceptance - like so what if I swallow, if he's a good guy he wont judge me, etc. However I can't seem to convince myself! I know for a fact that my swallowing is audible, and is frequent. And every time I'm lying next to a guy and I swallow, my heart starts to race. 

&#x200B;

I've struggled with OCD in the past (Pure O) and I wouldn't be surprised if this was just a form of that. Regardless, that doesn't really help me solve my problem. I just want to know if anyone else has ever had this problem, and how they dealt with it. Just knowing I'm not alone would really help me.

303,Is this a panic attack?,"Lately, if I'm alone for a day, there's a good chance that at some point during the evening I'm going to have a really rough 1-2 hours. 

It starts with rising feelings of loneliness and despair, then moves to anxiety and the feeling that I need to get away from something. After about thirty minutes, if it's bad, this has progressed to the point that I'm hyperventilating, have tears rolling down my face, and am having what I can only describe as 'bad feeling chills'. It's like when a chill/shiver passes through your body but it feels like potent negative emotions are passing through.

This experience ebbs and flows for about an hour and then afterwards I'm exhausted.

Does this sound like a panic attack? I'm confused because I've had a panic attack before and it was more intense, only lasted for a few minutes, and I actually felt panicked. With this new thing it's just intense anxiety/despair.  ",8,2018-10-01 03:10:49 EDT-0400

Others can be excited but not “require” anything from me but there’s those that seem to demand approval or reciprocation of their excitement. I can’t handle it and get exhausted to the point of taking a nap or even a shower to get quiet time. I know I have my own anxiety disorder in play but the demanding-exciting people end up upset or disappointed in me, or redirecting their energy as concern for me when I just need them to stop directing ANY energy at me. Does anyone have advise on how to handle this?  I’m getting a little bombarded with it right now in anticipation for a trip 2 months from now and it makes me not even want to go.

Remeron is quite weak for anxiety and i dont plan on taking on xanax for much longer...so my doc suggested i add a low dose antipsychotic...which is the safest one? Or which should i try first before going on to the more serious ones. He gave me Sulpiride (Dogmatil) which works quite differently than most antipsychotics, as it only works on dopamine receptors and doesnt touch serotonin. Should i give this a try first? I dont see it mentioned online much or it being popularly used which scares me away from it. However he also suggested Zyprexa, Abilify, Seroquel, Risperidal...what should i do here?",1,2018-10-01 00:36:50 EDT-0400

310,"starting a new job tomorrow, crying tonight","posted a while back when i started working again after about 6 months of unemployment and living happily- but poor- with my then-girlfriend (now fiancée!). i was sort of smacked with crippling anxiety and depression over going back to work and being away from her. 

fast forward another 6 months to the beginning of september: my work environment was no longer a good place for me. i was having anxiety dreams about work that caused me to throw up- a big deal for an emetophobe like me- and i ended up handing in my notice. 

i was very lucky to interview well and land a new job without any gap in wages for my bank- so fiscally and practically, i’m all good. but now i’m in a position where i’ve had three full weeks back in my fiancées pocket feeling safe and happy and now i have to go back to work and i’m freaking out again

i know this is a super long post and i’m not really sure what i’m asking for here but like, idk, if any of you have any spare hugs or encouragement i’d be super grateful.

311,An interesting thought about anxiety...,"I didn't give this too much though, first of all. And I'm certainly not Jordan Peterson. Just a random person.  


So I've had anxiety for more than half of my almost 37 years.  
I won't go into the details, but I consider it pretty bad. I've lost jobs, can barely make a phone call, etc. I consider it to be the absolute worst thing in my life. I'd do just about anything to take it away.  


But is anxiety a luxury? An easy excuse? A modern thing?  
Look, I know my life isn't terrible. I have a two awesome children, a decent job, food, shelter, safety, freedoms, etc. I don't fear for my life on a regular basis, I've never had to worry about feeding my children or finding water. And I am thankful for and appreciate it. 

I can't imagine the countless millions, billions even, throughout history or even now, letting anxiety have such an impact on their lives. They would probably trade their hunger pains for my anxiety all day.  


And despite knowing that I have it pretty good, I still freak the hell out over some pretty pathetic things.  


Please, forgive this post. I know that it's not that simple. And I'm sure I missed other things. It's just something I thought about earlier. And I'm not down playing anyone or what they feel.

314,I'm probably going out with him to see a movie next weekend... I'm scared...,"We aren't dating.  I don't think.  It's complicated but here's a basic back story for context (feel free to ask if more clarification is needed). 

It all started just about a year ago.  I was really starting to like him. In my mind we were just friends, but it really seemed like it had the potential to be more than that.  I wasn't ready for committing to a real relationship and my self hate made me feel like it wasn't fair to him anyway because I suck and he's amazing.  I'd had anxiety for as long as I could remember, as well as other undiagnosed mental health issues (BPD, ADD, depression). He cared for me and gave me attention at a time in my life that I really needed it, and it scared me to need someone that much.  It scared me to wonder if he really cared about me or if it was all in my head. Eventually I couldn't ignore the severe panic attacks any more, so in the middle of an anxiety attack I sent him a bunch of confusing messages and we met up.  It was terrible.  I felt trapped sitting in his truck talking to him.  I felt like I'd trapped him by demanding answers to questions I didn't even understand myself.  To be honest, I dissociated and I really don't remember much of that day except that it was terrible and I don't want to experience that ever again, and I feel terrible that he saw me that way.  

We've seen each other since then.  We've had our ups and downs.  I finally got into therapy and got my diagnoses.  I'm doing better. But every once in a while I still freeze and it's like my mind shuts down and all I'm aware of is a tension, and I'm afraid. It's like there's a wall I'm hiding behind but it's pressing me and I'm trapped.  Sometimes I'm not even sure why I feel that way.  Taking deep breaths and grounding myself helps sometimes.

&#x200B;

I'm anxious that I'll get afraid when I'm with him and be really boring company.  I want to be someone who deserves all the patience and kindness he's given me.  I've run to him and run away from him more times then he even knows. I'm scared I'll mess it up.  I'm scared and I suppose I'm hoping that maybe someone could empathize and give me some advice?

317,Being scared conflicts with education.,"First of all, I am sorry if this gets too boring/repetitive. Really need to get this out (and possibly get som advice?)

This sounds stupid, stupid, stupid. After being out of school for three years due to a bunch of mental problems making me a full-time psychiatric patient, I (19) am finally considered stable enough to take some courses at an upper secondary school for people who are in psychiatric treatment. So far, so good. 

In English (my third language) class we are supposed to write a persuasive essay, and I find myself absolutely unable to do it. There is no topic I have such detailed knowledge about that I can rightfully argue for a certain point of view. (Or, there are, but they're unsuitable for school.) I've read the resources, thought about it so much that I can't focus on reading, tried to just scribble down ideas...and get stuck. I will just sit at my desk digging my nails into it, writhe, feel my heartbeat go up, and just freeze. Then sit there for 15-30 min doing absolutely nothing before I get up, try to clear my mind and get a fresh start. It doesn't work.

I can't do this.  Gone so far as wasting time on writing a letter of apology now; wasting because I won't dare to hand it in, convinced it will only be seen as some lazy excuse for not bothering to do homework. It is frustrating, because I really enjoy English class in general, but completely lack the confidence/authority and rhetoric skills to justify writing something like that. I think it also plays a role that I do not at all like the idea of revealing an opinion (a part of myself; exposing myself, scared of being vulnerable) to a stranger just like that. 

It ha gone so far as that I skipped all English lessons last week. My ""excuse""; both times I had become so nervous an guilt-ridden the night before that I punished myself and had to go to the A&E instead of school resp. lost consciousness. Yes, that makes me ashamed, and I can't exactly tell school that's why I didn't attend. Tomorrow there is English again. I wish I was able to get that essay done. I ""want"" to punish myself again, but it is reasonable to assumd that it would go too far tonight. Feel like I'll never be able to make it into that classroom again (And not to school, because I am terrified of getting confronted about laziness)

I see posts about people having no friends and how making friends is hard all the time and I get it, I'm in that boat too. So I want to reach out to the people who would like a complete stranger to check up on them at a completely random time over the next 31 days.

If you leave your username I'll go through, when I'm bored, and send you a private message asking ""are you ok?""

You can reply with one word, yes or no, or you can spill your guts to me and I'll do my best to give you good advice or at the very least give you a ""Fuck that * insert person* for being such a * insert derogatory name.*""

329,"American politics is REALLY fucking with me, and it's making it hard to be around my family.","I live in North Carolina.  I went to college, initially, for political science and economics, but about 3/4 of the way through that switched to education and biology because my gut told me to GTFO.

In high school, I took AP history and AP government and politics and fell in love with America's founding principles, the political system's design (and intent), and being able to have spirited, informative debates with my peers.  I was at Barack Obama's inauguration with my AP G&P class, and it was wonderful.  One of the most amazing things I've ever witnessed.

But here's the thing...  I was ultra, ridiculously, lick-Ann-Coulter's-asshole conservative during that time.  I had grown up in a trite Republican household in the rural south with traditional right-wing values and a lot of Jesus.  My grandparents are also very conservative.  Fox News was *always* on.

Things quickly began changing when I moved to Raleigh for college.  More racial and religious diversity, time away from Fox News, I discovered Reddit...  And then some personal things happened, as well.  I started having mood swings regularly, I had my first panic attack, I developed epilepsy, I was frequently in the hospital, I had no money...  I got pregnant and had an abortion.

All of this was very eye-opening.  I learned sympathy and empathy really quickly.  It was easy to be politically conservative when I was pretty much totally ignorant to the realities that most people face every day.  But going through all of that changed my view completely.  Suddenly, I saw why people needed government assistance for food, healthcare, transportation, and housing.  I understood why a woman should be free to make a choice about having an abortion (if that pregnancy didn't kill me due to my epilepsy, the child would have had major defects due to the medications I was on at the time).

NOW, though...  Look at what is going on in the US.  Every time I think shit has hit the fan, someone reaches into the shit-bucket again.  It makes me so anxious.  My healthcare is going to be fucked with, I wouldn't be surprised if ADA got dismantled, women's rights are being stripped away...  Not to mention how racial minorities are being fucked.  I might be getting screwed for being a woman, but at least I'm white...

My parents, especially my father, love *all of this.*  I've been spending a lot of time with them following my hospitalization earlier this year from February-April.  Every time I'm there, if the TV is on, it's on Fox News.  If my dad's around, he won't shut up about how *wonderful* Trump is (without giving any real reasons), he says insanely racist things, talks about how people with disabilities are just exaggerating, etc.  It makes me pissed initially, but then I just become anxious because it's so upsetting to see and hear.  Does he think *I'm* faking it, with my multiple suicide attempts and scar-covered body???

He's even got a signed picture of Trump and Melania up on the refrigerator from during the campaign when he donated to them.  Even if I was still conservative, I would've taken that shit down early last year--and, in retrospect, things were mild at that time.

He asks for my opinions, more than likely, to try to confirm how he feels.  He'll loudly commentate on whatever story Fox has on at the time, blame a minority or liberal for something, then ask what I think.  If I didn't have the political background that I do, I would not know WHAT to say.  However, I know how to play along to shut him up sooner, and that's what I do.  It's never what I believe, though, and it's such a sad situation.  I can't even be honest with him or he might just tell me to leave.

**TL;DR:  American politics is currently fucked, and it's really freaking me out.  My Dad *loves* Trump and watches Fox News constantly, even when I'm visiting, and gets all up in my bubble with his ideology whilst not knowing that I vehemently disagree with almost everything he says.**

*EDIT:  You people who are insulting me and PMing me for expressing how I feel need to get some hobbies.  If anyone would actually like some in-depth information and a timeline regarding my anxiety, look through my post history.  I didn't suddenly get anxious about this particular topic whilst having no anxiety regarding anything else.  I'm not targeting anyone specific with my initial post, I was just trying to talk to some people that I thought would understand.*

*BUT, if you do feel upset by my post, instead of calling me names or sending me threats, maybe you should recognize the fact that you feel anxious for a similar reason despite our differing political beliefs.  Because it's the same feeling.*

331,My therapist had me try Brainspotting on Friday. Holy shit.,"I've had anxiety ever since I can remember. The past couple years it's gotten to a point where it was getting so bad that I was developing depression, ruining relationships with friends and family, not leaving my apartment, etc. It was causing a lot of strain on my relationship as well. So after years of saying I'd go see someone.. I finally started seeing someone about a month ago.

Last week she wanted to do a Brainspotting session with me to see what kinds of mid-brain emotions and feelings we could uncover and release. And see how my anxiety manifests, and where, as we learn to identify my thoughts and find potential triggers.

It was intense. I remember when she first explained it to me, I was skeptical. I didn't understand how that could possibly do me any good or even get a reaction. But it did.

We did that for my entire session. I thought about memories I had long forgotten about. Felt my arms get painfully hot, then go numb. My temple throbbed where I get migraines. I cried - a lot. I found it hard to swallow and breathe.

And then with I'd say about 10 minutes left, I felt relief. Not just from those things, but actual mental relief. I felt it leave through my fingertips. I smiled. I still was having thoughts of these people and events, but then went from being negative and hopeless to appreciative and grateful. 

My anxiety over the weekend was basically non-existant. I actaully made an effort to see friends. I felt energy. I felt like a literal weight was lifted off of my shoulders.

I'm not sure anyone else has done this yet, or what their experience has been with it. But I'm interested to hear if you have. And I know it's a fairly new practice, but it's one I'm excited to explore further to see what else can be uncovered and hopefully let go of. ",84,2018-07-02 22:43:02 EDT-0400

When you realize this is just a physical sensation like any other, it should feel a bit lighter on you. It should reduce your fear and stop the ""loop"".

333,Had a panic attack at work yesterday and now I know how awesome people can be,"It comes on sometimes on my way to work. If I exercise or meditate I’m ok, but I had to be at work early and woke up later than I wanted. 

So on my way to work I had a panic attack and it continued once I arrived. Had to go out to the parking lot for a while. 

I also gotta mention that my work isn’t stressful. I’m an infant teacher at a daycare and I love it. I’ve had anxiety most of my life and it’s been bad lately. Also, there were no kids that day because it was a “staff day.” So, no work related stress to set me off. I have been concerned about finances lately so that might have done it.

My coworkers were amazing. They let me go to the parking lot to calm down and when I went back into the building one of them gave me a hug and let me cry.  Both of my bosses, the Director and Assistant Director, were great too. I’ve been trying to find a therapist that works with my schedule, and sometimes it’s hard to change schedules or leave early because you have to maintain teacher ratios. They assured me that they would work with me. 

I know I am lucky to work at a place with so many understanding people. It wasn’t easy and a little embarrassing to cry about a panic attack to my boss but I feel that talking about my mental health issues without shame is important. I have a health issue, just like diabetes or any other chronic illness, and I shouldn’t be ashamed. 

I hope you guys have at least one person at your job or school who will hug you after a panic attack and let you cry and ask if you need water. Know that you are not alone and I feel the pain of being at the will of fear and terror and not having control over it sometimes. I’m getting help and I hope you will too.

Maybe this is just me, but I don't want to be told that this is normal, becasue that almost implies that it's fine to live my life this way or that's it's not that bad. And that's not the case. Anxiety is ruining my life. I need help which I'm now thankfully getting.

I'm not trying to say that everyone here is abnormal. Everyone will feel how they feel and you should have control over that. I'm just saying that, personally, I don't want to be told that *this* is normal. I want to learn how to cope with anxiety and have that be my 'normal'.

345,My Anxiety story and how I overcame it. *might cause triggers*,"Hello everyone, I wanted to share my anxiety story with you, its probably gonna be a long post so bare with me.

It all started around 6 - 7 months ago, as I woke up, got ready to work, starting to feel weird, I just ignored it, as I walked down the stairs, I felt like I have to go to the bathroom like RIGHT NOW, started vomiting, diarrheas, depersonalization, felt like I'm dying any moment now, and all I could think is how I'm going to spend my the rest of my life in a psych ward, thought I'm going insane.

From that very moment, my anxiety was over the roof, consistently, 24/7, if I had to describe it by a scale of 1 to 10, it would be 50, just feels like crap, and something awful is about to happen any moment, was stuck in my bed, with 0 motivation to do anything, just a constant state of anxiety and fear from the moment I woke up to the moment I went to sleep, sometimes having nightmares, and all of a sudden more and more fears are forming, fear of the future, fear of dying, fear of losing my mom, fear of aging, fear or relationships, fear of literally EVERYTHING.

At some point I even started having an existential crisis, asking myself whats the purpose, why are we here, I assume its called being suicidal? not too sure tho.

For the next two weeks, I threw up EVERYTHING I ate nor drank, even water, I visit the nurse a few times to get fluids by IV since my body was collapsing and I already lost 10 (hard gained) kilos.

My doctor sent me to a Psychiatrist, he claimed its Panic Disorder and let me off with Clonex and Cipralex.

Got home eager to finally be in treatment and put it all behind me, I took the Clonex and absolutley nothing happend, maybe a bit tired and anxiety is still through the roof, and then I took the Cipralex but my body rejected it every time, I threw it up every time, managed to keep it inside a few times but it just worsen every symptom I had, by the fifth day I stopped taking them because I couldn't take it no longer.

I've found a book named Hope and Help for you nerves by Claire Weekes, which helped tremendously with the physical symptoms and gave me a nice outlook as for whats going on, but it was no cure whatsoever, even though I'd recommend it for anyone suffering from anxiety.

So after a month or so, all of a sudden my mental state started improving quite a bit, started to feel less and less nausea, my appetite gradually built itself back up, started gaining my weight back up, and went on a vacation abroad with a  cruise ship with my mom, at that point I felt like ""I'm finally over it"", or so I thought, around a week after coming back, it all started happening again, at this point I felt really hopeless, why is this nightmare happening again? thought i'm over with that crap, I also started suspecting i'm bipolar, which raised my anxiety even further.

A month later, being in the same state, I played WoW, and there was this argument over drugs in the global chat, and one of the sides claimed shes a psychiatrist, so I sent her a message, I asked quite a few questions and she was kind enough to answer them, but theres this one thing she told me that got me thinking, I claimed that the panic attack was random, out of the blue, yet she explained that a panic attack MUST have a source, could be a dream, a thought, doesn't matter what, but there has to be a source, some sort of stimuli.

So I started thinking, there has to be something in common that I did the first time it happend, and after I came back from the vacation, and there it was, a course of antibiotics, even though my doctor said antibiotics can not cause any of this, I googled ""Doxycycline anxity"" or ""Doxycycline depression"" and I was left speechless, HUNDREDS of people experienced the exact same thing as I did, further investigation explained that in our gut we have this delicate balance of good and bad bacteria, and antibiotics acts just like chemo, it erases EVERYTHING, both good and bad bacteria, when our gut leaves this state of balance, it causes havoc both on our body and our mind, its medical term is Dysbiosis, which means unbalanced gut microbiome, sometimes balance isn't restored by itself unless you step in. so people might suffer  for years before getting better.

So I decided I'd give this a shot, I started making changes in my diet, I took off all sugar from my diet since bad bacteria feeds on it, I started eating prebiotic food such as fermented vegetables, started taking probiotics, in short, started introducing my gut healthy bacteria, thus reversing the devestating effects that the antibiotics caused.

At first my symptoms  worsened a bit, since I made changes to the balance in my gut again, but after that, it all slowly started to fade, my fears started to have less and less grip on me, my appetite started growing back again, my mental clarity as opposed to the constant fatige state I was in, no more fears, no more anxiety, no more stress over nonsense, just back to being myself again, kinda hard to believe a simple antibiotic caused all of this suffering.

I learned from my experience that anxiety is often our body telling us something is wrong, something is unbalanced, but it can not use words to pin points the problem so you gotta keep looking till you find whats causing this.

At the end I can say theres a side of me that is happy it happend, I had the opportunity to learn a lot about our brains, the anatomy behind it, the amygdala, the hippocampus, its relationship, whats incharge of what, etc.

I also learned that our gut has a huge role on our mood, and what we eat can contribute A LOT to anxiety and might even be the cause.

Wish you all best of luck and quick recovery.",42,2018-07-05 17:58:53 EDT-0400

348,Anxiety over Parents Dying,"Does anyone else have really intense, prevalent anxiety over their parents dying? Whenever they’re even slightly ill, even if it’s just with a cold, I get so panicky and worried. Even just thinking about them dying can make me cry. It’s got to the point when whenever I do see my parents or speak to them on the phone I have to tell them I love them before they go because I feel like if I don’t they might get in an accident or something and die and they won’t have known I love them. It’s become almost obsessive to the point where I get really upset and can’t focus if I don’t leave on good terms with them or something. I used to always worry about them dying but never to this extent. It’s become my biggest fear and I know it will happen at some point but I just can’t bare the thought of them getting seriously ill or something happening. I think part of it stems from the strong attachment I have to them, especially to my mum, where she is who I look to for guidance, love and support in all situations and I honestly don’t know how I would cope without her. She’s there for me with all my mental health problems and atm I don’t feel like I could do any of what I’m doing if I didn’t have her. Also I feel guilty for how ungrateful I may have been when I was young towards them and so worry that they’ll die without me ever being able to make amends for that. And as i still live at home i also don’t know what I’d do financially without them either. Mostly though I’m curious to know if anyone else struggles with anxiety over their parents/someone close to them dying? and if anyone has any ideas on how to decrease this and learn to just accept things as they are.

349,I used my Mic a few minutes ago,"I have really bad Social Anxiety and using my mic in video games gives me almost crippling anxiety. I can't describe it. Or why it happens. I've been on 100mg of zoloft for a month now.
Overwatch is one of my favorite games and I've been trying to level up on comp and, the only realistic way is to use my mic and be strategic and grouped up. And I've always been too scared to talk to people but today I used it and I feel proud of myself. Even if it was just one match. It wasn't as scary as I thought it would be. And with the new update and endorsements I feel like it pushes people to be less toxic and more positive. 
It also might be the zoloft making me less anxious? I don't know, but I'm going to keep pushing myself to talk with people. I need to get out of gold haha.

Usually this will happen after working a shift or leaving classes for the day. 

I end up questioning the things I did or said during the day and if I did everything correctly. Often times these anxieties come up when trying to go to sleep.

360,How I Beat my Anxiety Disorder and Advice on How to do so Yourself,"So if you’re reading this and currently in the midst of an anxiety disorder, let me start by saying I know how you feel. I’ve had panic attacks where the adrenaline rushes just don’t stop, I’ve been nauseated and unable to eat or drink for days on end, I’ve felt so short of breath it was like drowning above water, had the jitters and the lump in my throat. I’ve also had all of the uncomfortable mental symptoms. I’ve dissociated for almost a full day multiple times, I’ve had racing, intrusive thoughts that lasted weeks and sometimes months at a time. And I’ve felt like I was going crazy. A lot.

But I’m here to tell you my struggle with my anxiety disorder is over. After almost a year of conscious and concerted effort, all of the worst symptoms of my anxiety are completely gone. Some of the more mild ones still appear from time to time; I’ll get fatigued or dizzy/foggy maybe once every few weeks, but this happens so infrequently (and becomes less frequent with each occurrence) that it doesn’t really bug me. I was also on medication (an SSRI since day one and a benzo for the first few months) and am in the process of tapering off .

So I wanted to write a post about how to get over each stage of your anxiety, mainly because I know I really would have appreciated this kind of guidance when I first sought help in late April of last year. If you want a summary of things you can do regardless of what stage you’re at, scroll to the bottom and check the paragraph in bold.

I don’t discuss responses to specific symptoms here, just a general approach. If you’re looking for tactics for specific symptoms, check out the list of books I left in the second section. I think the first one does a particularly good job of addressing every symptom, but you can try the third if you don’t feel it makes enough of a difference.

Before you read, I want to mention something once so I don’t have to later on. Recovery is going to be like a rollercoaster. Some days you’ll feel like you made incredible progress, and others you’ll have difficulty even doing simple tasks. It’s going to be a lot of two steps forward, one step back. Sometimes it’ll even be two steps forward, two steps back. But even those times are okay, because they serve as proof that you are capable of improving. Just know that once you start to give effort, things will start gradually getting better.

So here it is. My comprehensive guide to recovering from an anxiety disorder.

If you’re at a constant 9/10 - 10/10 anxiety and can’t calm down:

At this stage, you’re either in the middle of panic attack (which lasts up to 60 minutes) or you have GAD and are constantly anxious. I was diagnosed with GAD and Pure-O but I’ve had maaaaaany panic attacks, so I know this advice will work for both.

**1.** Stop trying to fight your anxiety symptoms. Understand that the best thing you can do for your body right now is just let it run its course. This is the basis of Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) which is one of the types of therapy currently used to treat anxiety disorders. To do this:

* Don’t try to stop any symptoms you are experiencing. This is infinitely easier said than done at first, but with practice you’ll be able to pick this up fairly quickly. When I was first having constant adrenaline rushes, I kept trying to consciously stop them. This was actually making things worse. The more you try to fight your symptoms, the more worried you become, which in turn causes your system to release more of the stress-causing hormones, causing your symptoms to become worse. The best thing you can do at this point is wait it out and let your body tire itself out. 

* Questions, doubts, and fear will come up. When they do, remind yourself that this is a totally normal process that your body is going through, and try to rest in the anxiety. It may be difficult, but try to ease into the symptoms. This was initially what helped my adrenaline rushes decrease in severity and frequency.

* If this isn’t working and you find your symptoms are still persisting and won’t stop, ask for more. As the DARE Response (discussed later) puts it, run towards your symptoms. If you’ve ever read a book on ACT, this step is likely in there. When you ask your body to make your symptoms worse, you’ll find it can’t. The symptoms of anxiety are driven by a subconscious worry, and not something you can control. Keep running towards it until your symptoms gradually begin to ease, then move on to step 2. In case you’re interested, the clinical term for this is “arousal reappraisal.” It’s not discussed very often, but I found it to be very helpful. 

**2.** Do anything you possibly can to get your mind off of the anxiety. In older forms of anxiety treatment, this kind of thing was referred to as a distraction tactic, but in The DARE Response, Barry McDonagh calls it being “engaged.” This basically means do whatever you can to focus your mind on something other than your anxiety. Regardless of what level of anxiety you’re at, this is incredibly important. **Your anxiety is most easily fueled when you focus on it, so do whatever you can to move your attention to something else.** Again, MUCH easier said than done, and your mind will fight you at every stage. But it’s an integral part of recovery. When I first started out, I found short activities the most helpful, like picking up my guitar/cajon and playing a song or two, or doing homework. 

**3.** Give it time. Your system can’t sustain anxiety levels this high for an extended period of time unless you consciously fuel it. If you are properly easing into your symptoms and engaging yourself in other activities you’ll eventually calm down to the next phase of anxiety recovery.

**4.** If recommended by your physician, a benzo might help. Benzos are basically nervous system relaxants, but they’re no magic pill. When I took my first dose of valium, I didn’t feel a thing. It took a few days of constant dosing to see any effect. Benzos are fine to use in the very beginning, but I will issue a warning about them: try to use them as sparingly as possible. Benzos are not meant to be used in the long term, and if the first thing you do when feeling anxious is reach for your benzo, you’ll have real difficulty recovering in the later stages. But since at this point, you’re in a constant state of panic, they’re a great way to ease you down to the next lowest stage of anxiety, so you can start focusing on the long term.

**5.** Journal. I don’t recommend this as much beyond this stage, as I’ve found it doesn’t really help all that much. But in the beginning stages of my experience with GAD, I found journaling to be an indispensable asset to really figure out what I was going through. Just write out whatever you’re thinking or feeling. It’s a great what to get out of your head for at least a little bit.

**6.** Get up and do something to release all your pent up adrenaline. Walk around the block, take a stretch break at work. You don’t need to be doing a full workout at this point, just something to help you use the jitters and adrenaline you’re getting for something productive.

**7.** This one may seem rather minor, but it helped me a lot in the beginning: fix your posture. It’s much easier to feel short of breath when you’re in a position that doesn’t let you breath easily. If you’re lying down, lay on your back. If you’re sitting, sit up straight.

Once you’ve thoroughly calmed down from this point (this took me about three or four weeks), you can move on to the next step.

Constant 6 - 8/10 with occasional panic attacks:

If you’re at this phase, you are probably still experiencing physical manifestations of your anxiety, like jitters, nausea, jelly legs, shortness of breath, and so on. But you’re not in constant freakout mode anymore. You can make logical decisions aimed more at long term recovery because rather than being focused on your anxiety 100% of the time, you pay attention to it 80 - 90% of the time. You may be leaving the house occasionally but your symptoms are still bad enough that they keep you at home most of the time. So here’s what to do at this stage:

**1. Start reading or listening to books on what you’re going through**. The more you understand the subtleties of what’s going on in your brain and body, the better you’ll be able fix them. Read up on therapy techniques as they’ll be your quickest route to recovery. In the end, this ended up being the single most helpful thing for my recovery. When you’re knowledgeable of exactly what is at your disposal, you can try everything and see what works best for you. In fact, I found really helpful ideas in books that none of my therapists had even heard of. Like your anxiety, the list of books that will be the most helpful for you is very personalized, but here are my recommendations (all of these books are available on Audible, which is how I consumed them):

* The DARE Response. Phenomenal book written by someone who’s been through the worst parts of anxiety and paved his own path to recovery. His techniques are a combination between ACT and a little CBT. I would especially recommend this book if you’re at the higher end of the anxiety scale.

* Feeling Good: The New Mood Therapy. This book is considered the gold standard of CBT. It’s aimed at treating depression, but (as the author notes) it works for anxiety as well. I listened to the whole thing, then picked out the chapters I thought applied to me. It’s long, so I don’t think you need to do the first part, but there’s a lot of valuable information in this book that a lot of other books skim over.

* Rewire Your Anxious Brain. This one is 1/4 CBT, 1/4 lifestyle guidance, and half about the neuroscience behind anxiety. I like this one a lot because it gets into some of the mechanics of why we feel the way we do, and why therapy and lifestyle changes are so impactful.

* The Subtle Art of Not Giving a Fuck. This one has been mentioned on this subreddit several times before, and I really like it. It serves as a great reminder of why some things in life just aren’t worth giving a fuck about. Fair warning: Mark Manson describes OCD as “an incurable disease” in this book. He’s not a doctor or therapist and isn’t really knowledgeable on the subject, so I’d take that section with a grain of salt. But the message he drives home at the end is really good regardless.
Remember, the point of these books isn’t to give you step by step instructions on how to get better. Rather they are there to give you ideas on how to best help yourself.

**2.** Get into therapy. This is perhaps the second most important things you can do for yourself behind reading. Therapy is the first line of treatment for anxiety, and for good reason. Once you find a therapist who you work well with, you’ll notice you progress much more quickly. Some things to look out for when you screen your therapist:

* Are they nice? Kind of an obvious one but worth going over. Do you feel like they take what you’re saying seriously? Are their answers usually thoughtful and caring?

* Are they experienced? My first therapist was tremendously nice and caring, but he didn’t know much about anxiety treatment beyond the very basics, like square breathing. 

* Are they accessible? Or do you have to drive two hours to see them? Are they available for weekly sessions or can you only see them once a month?
It may take a while until you find a therapist who’s right for you, but this is a person you’ll be meeting with multiple times a month for several months/years. I would advise giving your therapist at least three or four sessions before you consider switching to a new one. 

**3.** Continue with all the acceptance techniques outlined in the previous section. These are things that I remind myself of even now. The more open you are towards your anxiety symptoms, the more quickly they’ll dissipate. In addition, if you can, start easing off your benzo a little bit. If you’re taking it three times a day, try to move down to two. If you’re down to two a day, try one.

**4.** Start making some lifestyle changes that are proven to help with anxiety in the long term:

* Cardiovascular exercise. It’s said that exercise is one of the most positive things to improve mood when you’re anxious, but I’d like to look at it from the opposite perspective. When you’re anxious, your body is filled with excess adrenaline that keeps building up. If you don’t dump it out somehow, the symptoms will inevitably get worse. So getting up from your desk or your bed is one of the most effective things you can do to help yourself in the long term. If you’re not super exercise savvy, my suggestion is to get out and walk, jogging occasionally. Walking is great for releasing excess energy, but you can boost the speed at which you let off adrenaline by running. You don’t need to do sprints whenever you run, but you’ll get the most out of your exercise if you really challenge yourself each time. More on this later.

* Meditation. The reason so many people say this is so good for anxiety is because it helps you better come to terms with your symptoms. It also lets you really hone in on some of the less productive thought processes you’re having so you can learn to catch and correct them. Keep in mind, the purpose of meditation is not to clear your mind and think of nothing. In fact, it’s almost the opposite. While meditating, your job is to let your body and brain work as normal and merely try to act as a conscious observer of all your thoughts and feelings. A really popular visualization technique for this is thinking of your thoughts as clouds, and you’re just watching them pass by. There is plenty of information out there on how to meditate, and it includes helpful techniques like noting, so I won’t go into it that much here. Make sure that your approach to meditation is similar to your approach to exercise: slowly ease into it by doing it for short periods at first, then working up very gradually to longer periods after every couple sessions. I suggest trying out the meditation app Calm.

* Diet. If you’re reading this, you’ve probably read the do’s and don’ts of your diet about a hundred times, but I’ll reiterate quickly here: no caffeine, no alcohol. Try your best to avoid excessive sweets and fried foods, and those are shown [1] to worsen your mood in the long term. One of the less known changes you can make to your diet is to include more natural sources of magnesium. It is speculated [2] that magnesium plays a part in anxiety regulation, though the research isn’t entirely there yet. Regardless, try to include dark leafy greens like spinach and whole grains like brown rice into your diet to hit this as a staple. You can also take a magnesium supplement (I’ll defer to the DARE Response for information about it), though again, research is shaky so this alone won’t bring change. 

* Medication. This one will be completely at you/your doctor’s discretion. Some people respond well to antidepressants, some don’t. I didn’t feel like they helped me all that much, but you might. Note, the purpose of antidepressants isn’t to make you happy or to gradually cure your anxiety. Research shows [3] that antidepressants are useful for supplementing long term change in the brain. This is a REALLY important thing to note because it means that antidepressants won’t change anything on their own. Only if you give conscious effort will you be able to see positive change. Medication only makes it happen more quickly.

**5.** Give it time. Your nervous system doesn’t change overnight. It may need a week or two more before you achieve the results you want. So just keep practicing your therapy techniques and doing everything you know works and push through.

Once you’ve been at these things for a while, you’ll notice your anxiety start to decrease to the next phase.

Hovering around 4 - 6:

If you’re at this stage, congratulations! The first two stages are really hard to break out of, and if you did, it likely took a tremendous amount of effort. So give yourself a pat on the back. Once you’ve reached this stage, your anxiety likely doesn’t manifest itself physically as much. You may still get nauseated occasionally, but most of the time you’re able to eat and drink and (hopefully) sleep through the night. You’ve started reclaiming your normal life. You get out of the house relatively frequently and do things like run errands. But you’re still really anxious whenever you go out. In addition, though your physical symptoms may have eased up, your mental symptoms may still be incredibly difficult to deal with. So here’s what you should do at this stage:

**1.** Keep staying the course. It’s easy to flounder or stop, and it’s okay if you do. But remember to pick up right where you left off. Also, don’t beat yourself up for making mistakes. Everyone falters from time to time, it’s part of what makes us human. And it’s okay if things are taking longer than you expected. Take it from me that if you keep looking for ways you can improve your anxiety and practicing the techniques you know work, things will get better.

**2.** Keep pushing the envelope. Identify areas of your life that you’ve always been anxious about and challenge yourself to use therapy techniques to improve them. I used to beat myself up for being awkward ever since I was a little kid. I’d find flaws in every interaction I had with others and nitpick every little thing. Once I started working on this, I noticed not only an improvement in these kinds of situations, but also an improvement in my overall anxiety. This is part of how Exposure and Response Prevention (ERP) therapy works. You expose yourself to situations that make your anxiety flare up, and use CBT techniques to curb your conscious worry. An important note about this is **these experiences aren’t meant to be fun**. If you’ve got social anxiety and you’re challenging yourself by going to meet new people, it’ll likely be an uncomfortable experience the first few times. People around you may be having plenty of fun while you keep worrying and criticizing yourself. But you’ll slowly notice improvement, and with time, it’ll become more and more natural over time.

**3.** Along the same lines, start making your workouts more difficult. Run/bike/swim for longer, lift heavier weights. When you’re anxious, you tend to stagnate in certain areas of your life, sometimes without realizing it. The only way to get better is to keep pushing the bounds of what you do. I saw a post on this subreddit a while ago along the lines of “I’ve been lightly jogging for 25 minutes a day for the last month or two, why aren’t I seeing my anxiety improve?” And the answer in this case is because this person wasn’t pushing him/herself. If you continue to do the same things, you shouldn’t expect to see improvement.

**4.** Start identifying and cutting off some of your crutches/unhealthy habits. For a lot of us (me included), this comes in the form of googling symptoms or constantly asking for help on this subreddit. It’s okay to cave every once in a while at this stage, but you need to consciously stop yourself from constantly asking for help on the internet. One of the things this does is keep you focused on your anxiety, which is exactly what engaging yourself is meant to prevent. I stopped browsing this subreddit for almost a half year, and my condition got much better as a result. If you’re seriously concerned about something, visit your doctor/psychiatrist/therapist and ask them, but once they diagnose you, do not second guess it. I spent my entire college career going to different doctors (I think at least 10 or 11 different types, sometimes multiple doctors of each kind). I was convinced there was something wrong with me that no one could find, but the true culprit was anxiety. If you **feel** like you’re constantly sick or dying, yet doctors can’t find anything wrong, this is a clue that you have an issue with being a hypochondriac. You can go about fixing this the way you did in all areas of your therapy (I personally used the CBT method outlined in Feeling Good), but the important thing is to recognize that just because your brain is telling you something doesn’t mean it’s true. 

**5.** Give it time. I’ve said it before but it’s important to reiterate. Recovering from this stage might take several months, so try your best to be patient. And remember, if things aren’t the way you want them to be now, they will be soon.

I think it’s also important to discuss the idea of **cognitive fusion**, which you may have come across in your book reading, as I think understanding it will be really helpful. Google defines cognitive fusion as attaching a thought to an experience, but since that’s kind of vague, I’ll give my own definition. Cognitive fusion is when you take what your thoughts tell you as fact. In other words, you’re using your thoughts to draw irrational conclusions about the world around you. One example of this is if you’re someone who criticizes themselves too much. You might tell yourself “that conversation was so awkward, so that person must think I’m a loser.” In this case, whether or not the situation was awkward, you don’t know what the other person is thinking. I used to think this a lot until I realized people really didn’t see me that way, and all the worrying I did was for nothing. A healthy level of questioning can do lots to help you overcome your anxiety.

At this stage, I had the most trouble with mental symptoms, namely the feeling of going crazy. I thought the little floaters in my eyes were hallucinations, I always second guessed my own sanity, I thought the weird dreams or intrusive thoughts I was having were a sign of schizophrenia, and anytime I was happy, I thought it was a sign of bipolar disorder. This is another great example of cognitive fusion that took me a while to get over: I thought I was going crazy, so to me that was evidence that I really was. If you think this describes you, it might do you well to get into the habit of questioning your thoughts as well. Is it more logical that your psychiatrist, therapists, family, and friends are correct when they say you’re not crazy and are just experiencing symptoms of anxiety, or that you’re the one person out of the fifty who’s somehow figured out you’re losing it? This applies to basically every anxious situation you may encounter. Remember: **just because you think something doesn’t make it true**.

One of the things that took me a long time to realize was that my constant worry over these things was caused by the fact that I was paying so much attention to them. At this point in recovery, it’s absolutely **imperative that you keep yourself occupied, especially when you’re most anxious**. I found that doing things like cooking and cleaning were ways to keep my mind off my anxiety without having to think about it. I suggest doing the same, as they’re both productive and beneficial in the end. Eventually, your mind will calm down on its own and you’ll find your own solutions to these symptoms. I find that at this point the really important thing really is time. Once I felt like I was going crazy for the hundredth time, I realized that if every time before this one was a false alarm, this one (and all the ones after for that matter) are false alarms too. This stage took about 3 months to recover from, but once I did, I hit the next stage.

Anxiety is 1 - 3 most days, with some days feeling almost completely anxiety free:

You’re in the home stretch. This is it. You’re likely already giving yourself credit for all the hard work you’ve done, but you should still take a moment to recognize just how far you’ve come. For me, having a day where I go out and try something new with friends while anxious is something I wouldn't have been able to do even BEFORE my anxiety disorder. Certainly not anything I’d ever dreamed of while in the thick of it. Seriously, if you’ve hit this point, the light should be at the end of the tunnel. And on the days where it’s a little harder to deal with, let me reassure you: you’re almost home free.

Note: your symptoms will still be present at this point. Some of the intrusive thoughts might still come, sometimes you’ll have a bit of dissociation or an occasional almost-panic attack, but you know how to deal with these things. Your moments of panic don’t last more than a few seconds, and your symptoms don’t really illicit a response from you. At this stage:

**1.** You know what works best for you. Keep doing it. You have your techniques and you’ve clearly demonstrated they work. All that’s left is to keep doing them and reap the rewards you know will come. On the worse days when your anxiety peaks at a 3 or 4, remind yourself where you were several months ago and how you’ll never experience anxiety that bad ever again. Then gently engage yourself in something and ride the wave of anxiety until it subsides. 

**2.** Slowly lose your crutches. If you discuss your anxiety with your friends, stop doing so as frequently and eventually stop altogether. If you’re still occasionally taking benzos, slowly taper off. The more of your independence you get back, the more confident you’ll feel.

**3.** Keep exploring other areas of your life where you’ve had anxiety and use what you’ve learned to stop worrying. For me, this meant things like conquering my fear of heights by going snowboarding, and confronting my discomfort with physical and emotional intimacy by going out of my way to discuss these things. The more of these long-standing anxieties you’re able to ease, the better you’ll feel overall. Plus you get the added sense of achievement for doing things that past you would’ve never been able to do.

There really isn’t much left to say at this stage. I found myself being discouraged more frequently at this point just because I knew I was so close to the finish line but not quite there. In case you need any encouragement, remind yourself of how well you’ve done so far and that there’s more to come.

Then finally…

No anxiety, with the worst days peaking at a 0.5 or 1:

That’s it. All the voices in your head telling you you’re not good enough have gone silent. All those symptoms you used to worry so much about don’t really happen anymore. You might still be a bit fatigued or foggy some days, but most of the time you’re energetic, present, and can confront new challenges with a sense of confidence you’ve never had. It’s been a few months since you’ve even given your anxiety a second thought. You know some of your symptoms might come back for a short spell every once in a while, but you’re not worried about them. You know exactly what to do when that happens, and that they’ll go away just as quickly as they came.

I don’t have any advice for this point. You know what got you here and have built up the mental fortitude to know you’ll keep on doing it. 

Congratulations. You understand how amazing it is that you got to this point. Remember this feeling.
_

My therapist once gave me a great rule of thumb I think sums things up really well: whatever your anxiety is telling you to do, do the opposite. If it’s telling you not to get out of bed, do it. If it’s telling you not to go to a social event, do that. If it’s telling you you’re going to suffer from some grave illness, remind yourself that’s not true. If it’s telling you to google your symptoms or ask for help, don’t. If it’s telling you you’re losing your mind, remind yourself you’re not. Give it enough time, and eventually things will get better. 

**Summary:**

**Ease into your symptoms. Remember that it’s just anxiety and can’t do anything other than make you uncomfortable. You’ve been through this a hundred times before and survived every single time.**

**Don’t fight it. When you fight your anxiety, it only gets worse. So let your anxiety do whatever it wants and just watch as a detached observer.**

**Keep yourself occupied. The more time you spend thinking about your anxiety, googling your symptoms, posting on this subreddit, writing in your journal, or just stewing in general, the worse off you’ll be. Cook, clean, dance, exercise, paint, draw, do anything you can to forcibly rip your mind off your anxiety.**

**Keep pushing the bounds of what you’re doing. Expose yourself to more anxiety. Exercise harder. Try things you’ve never tried before. Make your anxiety flare up as much as possible because you know it’ll only benefit you in the end.**

**Regularly question your thoughts. Just because you think something doesn’t make it true. You’ll find a hundred times out of a hundred the thing you’ve been dreading isn’t half as horrible as your brain has made it out to be.**

**Give it time. You’ll find once you experience the same anxiety for the same reason for the thousandth time in a row that it becomes a bit easier to stop believing what it tells you.**

Thank you for reading this. I really hope that, no matter where you’re at in life, you gained something from this. Please let me know what parts of this were the most helpful, or if there’s anything you want me to expand upon. I’ll try to respond to comments as best I can, but I work full time and don’t log into this account all that much, so I’m sorry if I don’t get to your comment as quickly as you’d like.

Edit: Sorry if the formatting is a little funky. 

Edit 2: Thank you guys for the overwhelmingly positive response! I've read all of your comments and am super happy ya'll found this helpful. I want to remind all of you who are currently going through bouts of anxiety that you absolutely will make it through and that you'll be a much better person for it. 

Keep in mind: anxiety does not define you. An anxiety disorder is not a permanent condition. Much like any other illness or disorder, you can take gradual steps to recover. It may not come as quickly as you want and you will encounter plenty of pitfalls. But once you start counting your victories, however small, you'll realize what a **huge** difference your efforts can make.

Good luck guys :)

Edit 3: Tossed another David Burns book (author of Feeling Good), **When Panic Attacks**, up in the book list. Thanks u/PM10inPAYPAL4LULZ. Also fixed some formatting issues.

Edit 4: Thanks again for all the support everyone. I'm glad people are still managing to find this post even though it was written almost a half year ago. I tossed a book recommended by u/andrelolzi up on the list in case anyone is looking for more resources. ",55,2018-02-06 15:46:56 EST-0500

She agreed that would be a great idea and that way she wouldn’t have to be interrupted or worried when I would arrive to pick them up. 


The other day I had a lot of stuff to buy at Walgreens. The lady behind me had a bottle of shampoo. I told her to go in front of me because knowing she had only one item whereas I had lots made me feel anxious. She relied “You too? I get anxious over stuff like that, too!”

368,some ideas that have helped me out before.,"*I've been having a not-so-good day, so I read a post of mine from a couple years ago that usually helps me a little bit. This is it:*

I’ve been dealing with anxiety for a long time now and I’ve compiled some ‘ideas’ that have helped me out in multiple occasions. I’m sharing them below in hopes others can benefit from them. I’ve gathered most of them from the internet, so if you know the source ( I don’t), feel free to give credit! Disclaimer: non-native English speaker. Expect more than a few mistakes, ;)

**Future situations are too vague.**

How can you answer a question before it’s even asked? How can you solve a problem before it presents itself? Is my boss going to be mad at me or compliment me for my effort? Is he even going to say something? Is he even going to notice? Future situations are too vague, and trying to sort them out beforehand leads to frustration. That’s not smart. You will have the ability to deal with them if and when they happen, if nothing else because you’ll have more information about them.

**Most of my worries never happen anyway.**

Or “in my life I’ve known many problems, most of which never happened” (or something like that). That’s very, very true.

**If you treat every situation as a life and death matter, you’ll die a lot of times.**

Think about one of those ‘huge’ things that bugged you years back. Most of them don’t seem so ‘life and death’ now, I guess. Be smart about it and learn from experience.

**We have the energy to deal with today’s issues, not tomorrow’s (yet).**

Feeling like you must have a solution right now to all the problems you’ll face in your life is, obviously, too much. Nobody has. We all have the energy to deal with this very moment. Tomorrow, we’ll have the energy to deal with tomorrow’s problems (if they ever come to be).

**We are all in this together. Nobody has life figured out.**

Even though it may seem that some people do, it’s just not true. We tend to overestimate others’ knowledge only because they appear more confident than us. But I assure you that even the most confident person (your father, your boss, your teacher…) has tons of doubts, makes mistakes and screws up on a daily basis. They just don’t overthink those doubts and mistakes. That’s key to being confident. Again: we are all in this together. NOBODY has life figured out.

**Reality is uncertain. We all ‘improvise’ life.**

Reality can surprise you in a good or a bad way. Mostly, though, it will not surprise you at all. Whatever happens, you will deal with it when it happens. We all ‘improvise’ life.

**There is no bear.**

Our imagination is really powerful. That’s why scary movies work, right? Unfortunately, we tend to imagine things that scare us all the time. If you imagine there’s a big brown bear across the room right now, your body will react to that. So, the next time you get that ‘impending doom’ feeling in your chest, just realize that your imagination is messing with you. There is no bear.

**We are all one small adjustment away from making our lives work.**

You are not a thousand miles away from a happy life. You are right there, on the cusp of it. There’s probably just one small adjustment needed for your life to work. Maybe it’s learning to not overthink life and just take it a moment at a time. From then on, things will start to come together for you.

**This too shall pass.**

Good moments eventually end. Bad moments do too. No problem or bad feeling lasts forever. They just make way for whatever’s next.

**Life is not about waiting for the storm to pass, it’s about learning to dance in the rain.**

Life is not a movie! It will never be perfect, period (for ANYBODY). You are allowed to have fun and enjoy your imperfect life, your imperfect moments, even when you feel things are ‘wrong’ – that’s what life is about.

**We adapt.**

Things in our lives change sometimes, for better or worse. Don’t let the fear of change feel worse than the change itself. We are humans and adaptation is our thing. You’ll adapt to it in no time.

**It’s not the load that breaks you, it’s the way you carry it.**

Stop overestimating your responsibilities. You will fail more than a few times - you are not a superhero, and people know that.

**It’s better to shit your pants than to die of constipation.**

The fear that precedes some situations is 99% of the time worse than the situations themselves. Acknowledge this and get them over with. No matter the outcome, you’ll be able to deal with it.

**This is probably not an emergency.**

So, it’s okay to calm yourself down. You don’t have to have an answer right now. You have time.

**There will come a time when you’ll wonder why you were so worried about it.**

It’s happened before, right? Things eventually just worked out? Yeah, it will happen again and again. Take a breath and put things in perspective.",16,2018-02-05 17:29:51 EST-0500
369,Rage at everything when I’m having an anxiety attack,"Do other people suffer from rage as a result of their anxiety? Most of the time when I get anxious, I get overwhelmed and emotional and it usually results in tears.  Sometimes though, like today, I’ll get overwhelmed but instead of being sad, I get irrationally angry. 

I’m angry at my job for giving me so much work that I don’t know how to do, I’m angry that I make shit money, I’m angry that I’m so miserable. It makes me want to text old friends who have stopped being in my life and start an argument asking why that is, why was our friendship not good enough for you. I want to lash out at anyone who isn’t miserable or anyone who tries to give me stupid, generic advice regardless of how well intentioned it is. 

I’m only 26. I shouldn’t hate people and the world as much as I do. I’m gonna have to be here for presumably a very long time. I’m bitter about it and I hate everyone who isn’t because I’m jealous they don’t have to feel like this.

371,LPT: Screenshot reassuring/loving texts from your partner/friends and review them when you’re struggling with your thoughts,"I hope none of us are in the dark that our disorder can be hard on our partners and friends too. 

I have a huge fear of abandonment, and many times, I have to bring it up with the related person to work it out. In this situation, there’s not only the fear of abandonment but also the fear of weighing the other person down with your revisiting fears.

A few years ago, I got in the habit of screenshotting texts that really touched me. When I’m having trouble in my own head, I can refer back to them and revisit those moments to reassure myself with this persons own words, without having to always actively ask for them again.

This won’t work for everyone and all situations but it might help some.

388,My little self-care journey I am taking that I need to tell someone.,"I came  back on Saturday from an epic hiking trip and my anxiety and depression has been through the roof trying to adjust with going back to office work and dealing with normal struggles. In order for me to get back on my feet I have committed to a few things:

Delete my facebook page

Reconnected with an old high school friend that I am meeting over the weekend. She texted me first which is so rare for me because I have only two friends who text first. 

Signed my red heeler dog up for herding classes

Renewed my library card

Take B complex and Magnesium vitamins

Turn off my phone at 8 p.m. and read for an hour with a hot tea

Get back on budgeting again(deleted all monthly subscriptions beside my gym membership) to save up for my next adventure

Prepare for my 1st year wedding anniversary mini-trip on the 1st of Sept and just focus on ourselves instead of writing a paragraph on social media about it

I'm feeling good so far and I just started Sunday!

391,Does anyone else listen to music a lot as a coping mechanism?,"So, I listen to music a lot obviously.  I gravitate towards jobs that will let me use headphones because a lot of job environments are hell for anxious people.  I also listen to it at home and in my car when I go anywhere because driving is usually a stressful thing in itself.   I think I got it from my parents because they listen to a lot of music too everywhere.  I am just glad that this ""habit"" isn't as destructive as things like alcohol which also makes my anxiety go away instantly and we all know that isn't healthy.  What say you all?",31,2018-08-28 03:44:28 EDT-0400

393,Does anyone else feel intense shame towards themselves?," Are you ashamed of the person you've become?  Has your life taken on the characteristics of a nightmare?  I wish I could just wake up from this entire lifetime and have it all be just a bad dream and be done with it all.  Smoldering self-hatred.  It gets worse as I  get  older and can see my body starting to deteriorate as I continue to *not* develop/mature as a person, as I continue to waste my time distracting myself from my problems by feverishly consuming electric media.  My deficits and defects are becoming more and more apparent; my awareness of this makes going into public a highly painful experience.  It's getting harder and harder to function.

If someone cancels on plans I automatically think they are starting to get tired of me. I am absolutely terrified of people getting tired of me. 

I am deeply sad and exhausted because their actions show they do not hate me but I cant shake the feeling that they do.

They both rang me today within 5 minutes of each other to offer me the job!! So I was able to choose the one I liked best.

400,DAE get messages from others that you are too anxious to read and then get anxious all over again the longer you don't reply?,"Basically the title. I get so anxious opening work related (and in general too) messages/DM's because of the need to reply since the sender can see that you've read said message to the point of rarely opening them now. Well I feel great for a day and then my anxiety increases more and more the longer I wait to read the message. I'm to the point that I want to let someone else open all of my messages and relay the info to me, but some of the message chains have so many unread messages that I'm now afraid of just seeing/hearing bad news related to not opening the prior message that'll make me even more anxious. 

I'm in this inbetween area it feels like where I keep telling myself that tomorrow I'll open all of them so it subdues my anxiety a bit and this keeps going on daily. I literally have no valid excuse to tell these people either so I feel like I'm just intentionally screwing myself over and probably causing problems (that I haven't even read about yet in the unread messages).

I dug myself this hole and hate feeling anxious all the time from it, but also hate how I feel slightly less anxious just ignoring it.

Edit: Thanks everyone just for even replying, it strangely feels good to know that I'm not alone at all in feeling this way. Tomorrow I'm biting the bullet and going to go through all accounts (or what I can in the time I'll have) I can think of to reply to or delete messages and emails. Typed out a few replies for different situations that I'd been avoiding so I have no feasible excuse now! I'm bound to have a couple angry replies but I figure the quicker I reply the quicker I can sum up our conversation and never talk to them again! Thinking about it in that sense makes me just every so slightly excited to get rid of all the message baggage.",96,2018-08-06 07:43:23 EDT-0400

405,Has anyone ever vomited from having such high anxiety?,"23 F. GAD/Depression/USA 

Recently I feel like my anxiety is consuming my life. I’m on no medications for it. I’ve been unable to sleep at night, I can’t calm myself down anymore. Today I was so worked up on my way to work that I started to feel sick and I didn’t even make it all the way to work before I had to pull over and get sick. It was weird because it wasn’t like a lot. Just one swift projecting vomit and then it was over. Is this a symptom of anxiety?

407,My anxiety has made me less feminine,"I've always felt pretty girly.  At the beginning of college and prior, I was super preppy and loved dressing up, collecting makeup, doing my hair, etc.  As my anxiety worsened through college, I unconsciously stopped spending time on those things.  

I'm realizing now that part of my anxiety is a fear of looking vain in any capacity.  To the point where I would be afraid to wear earrings or paint my nails or update my profile picture on Facebook because it would seem like I was trying too hard or looking for attention.  

Upon reflection, thats a ridiculous way to live.  I'm literally afraid to express myself in any way because I'm afraid of??? Imposing myself on other people?  Being myself and finding out who might not like me?  The actual reasons aren't 100% clear to me yet, but I'm at least glad I've figured this part out.  

Upon recognizing this, I painted my nails, put on earrings, AND updated my profile picture (to a picture with just me in it for the first time!!) all because I wanted to!

Posting this to help myself.

Some explanation of the title:

The probability that your symptom is being caused by an underlying life-threatening, or otherwise frightening illness, is very low. It is easy, however, to believe that you may have said illness (e.g. through internet searching or otherwise). This is just a reminder, in the hopes that it may calm the nerves of anyone experiencing some form of distress, that there are many reasons you may experience an symptom.  In the vast majority of cases, the reason is not at all extreme.

I suffer from ‘health anxiety’ in where I basically have the occasional self induced panic attack thinking there is something wrong with me or that I am going to have a heart attack. About 7 months ago I tried floating, or sensory deprivation, and it changed my life. I now have a membership and float at least once a month. It literally feels as if someone stuck a vacuum inside my head and sucked out all the bullshit. The best part of it is, while my anxiety frequency has plummeted, floating directly relieves the bouts I still deal with.

I am not on meds though I am trying Gaba since I had some anyway. To make it even more fun, my sister is mad at me because I am ""chronically self centered"" because I forgot to get back to her about possibly getting together for dinner, because I am shut down.

It will happen randomly, but I've found in the last year it happens when a customer makes eye contact with me while I'm joking with them, when I'm talking to them about/greeting their dog, when I almost make a mistake and have to talk to them, or just out of nowhere during conversation. It isn't that I'm necessarily upset. Do you think this has to do with my anxiousness or is just a weird physiological response? What have you found helps with this?",19,2018-08-03 22:18:17 EDT-0400

It literally feels good at first and I think I do it out of anxiety. It feels good in the sense that the biting at first causes a kind of pain that actually feels good to me. Then I'll start bleeding and sucking the blood out of the newfound wound. This will go on for hours sometimes. 

Then I wake up two days later, unable to even open my mouth. I'll be in the worst pain I've felt all year, having to douse it with peroxide, constantly putting OraGel on it all day. I can barely eat anything because the food touches my cut and it will burn it. I end up hating myself for voluntarily biting my mouth and putting myself in this situation.  It finally heals 4 to 5 days later. 

Fucking brutal tho. Anyone else have this habit?

Edit: after reading all the comments and realizing alot of people do this without even taking note to it, I realize I think this may be a type of self-harm for me personally.

423,Had a really hard poop and my anxiety dissapeared for 3 days?,"
I hope this isn't TMI, but I need to get this out.

 For as long as I can remember I've had symptoms I think fall under anxiety: Muscle aches, fatigue, sleep issues, impending sense of doom, irritability, constant pounding heart beat that reverberates through my whole body, can't relax, nausea,  can't concentrate, migraines, digestion issues diarrhea etc.

Never realized these things weren't normal. Grew up in a very religious cult and just repressed these things because cult and god or whatever. Had it pretty bad about a year ago, ending in a few months of depersonalization (I think?) everything around me was just bizarre. I had object permanence issues. Yes like a baby. I would spend hours in my own head about how can a tree exist if I'm not looking at it.

I'm 20 now and have finally been able to cut ties with the cult now that I know it's complete horse shit, and the day that happened I had a particularly big and hard bowel movement, the kind that make you think you're giving birth. Only after that almost all my symptoms  vanished. I slept like a baby that night and woke up and just jumped right out of bed and felt no pain no nothing. Thought I was dreaming, really it was a miracle.

Finally had a clear head, felt peaceful and I actually planned for my future. This continued for 3 more days. Now it's all back. It feels twice as bad this time. Losing hope. Any advice is appreciated.

I made it to the appointment, thanks to all of you! You’ve all honestly been such a wonderful support to me today, and an inspiration. Thank you so much ☺️ 

I’m currently sat in the car, having a little cry - but it’s mostly out of relief and from finally being honest about how I feel. I had a wonderful doctor who really listened to what I said and made me feel so validated and cared for.

I sat down and had a whole cup of decaf tea and a full serving of oatmeal with berries. It took me almost 20 minutes, but it’s a huge leap from taking half an hour to finish maybe one egg. After the last panic attack I had I was still in a bad place by this point and couldn’t eat until noon, so see this as a sign that the work I’m doing is helping.

441,Ever felt physically sick because you really don’t want to do something?,"I’m frightened beyond belief today and today is the day that I’ve been fearing for 3 months. I started working in a bar at the start of the year, to earn money and to raise my self confidence. Today is my work’s charity event and this is the second time that this has taken place. It will basically have live entertainment, stores, bouncy castles etc. I’ve been told from fellow co-workers that the pub will get busy beyond belief and people will essentially be queuing for drinks outside. You may be thinking that I’m obviously not the only member of staff working. But, there are not many members of staff in general who work there.

444,I think I finally figured out what triggers my panic attacks,"For years I have never known what causes me to have panic attacks.

445,I want to remind you that...,"Healing is not linear.

Progress is not linear. It has ups & downs. 

I'm someone who's had their anxiety under control for the past four years & as someone with generalised anxiety disorder, I still go through bouts of anxious behavior/actions every day. But just because that is a truth I live with, I have learned to communicate with it to the point that allows me to be functioning and thriving.

But.

Just today I almost had a very bad anxiety attack. One that ruined my entire first half of the day. One that I just laid in bed naked, crying about. I felt weak both mentally and physically. I felt trapped in a body that didn't believe that I could function in a space of fear. I felt as if my body did not trust me to be a functioning and productive vessel of this earth. Luckily, I had a therapist appointment today. One that I told my best friend, ""I have no idea what we will even talk about today! I've been great!"" only to have the rest happen.

As a mental health advocate, well-known in my city, I fear that I will go back to the days where I was agoraphobic and thought that I would never be able to be a functioning member of society due to debilitating fear. I cried the moment I entered the door. I cried because of fear. I cried because I was not breathing for the good first 5 hours of my day. I cried because suddenly I was on a bridge with no place to run and I had no idea what it was I needed. I thought to myself, ""am I always going to go back?""...""will my anxiety always win?"" and the answer is no.

I did not lose. It did not win. I just let it boss me around. Just because you have done everything well and you've been feeling great, doesn't mean you're not allowed to accept the fact that you are human and things happen. Do yourself the favor of not judging yourself, accepting yourself radically for who you are, and reminding yourself that healing isn't a straight line forward. It's a lot of hills, loops, and jumps...because that is life.

Living with generalised anxiety disorder can be difficult but when you celebrate the accomplishments versus feeling bad for yourself for things that don't go right, life feels better and it's all based on what you choose to focus on.

Little things to us are HUGE. Little things to others, remain little things. We, after all, are getting the truest experience of life.

The ever-flowing moments of life and death yet, we always survive.

Keep surviving. Keep healing and be your biggest cheerleader. Others can't forgive you as well as you can forgive yourself.

I hope this helped someone. <3",21,2018-06-23 01:54:50 EDT-0400
446,When you're really stressed/anxious do you ever get flashy dots in your vision?,"Before I start, I want to preface this by saying that I've been to the eye doctor and everything is 100&#37; normal

So for me I've noticed anxiety kind of comes in waves. I'll have a few weeks where everything is fine and feel completely normal, and then suddenly have a 1-2 week period where I'm stuck in high gear. I'm walking faster, every human interaction is just trying to get something done, and no amount of meditation or sedation (alcohol) seems to bring me back down until it just kind of ends. The high gear isn’t high energy though, it’s like I’m totally exhausted, but can’t seem to calm down enough to rest. 

During these rough weeks, I've notices that I get a drilling ache in my right temple and weird flashy dots that occasionally appear in my vision.

Sometimes the dots are little red dots, and sometimes they're white and almost like the early part of an ocular migraine, but way before its super noticeable.

I've been to a doctor and was told that my vision was fine, and nothing in my eyeball seemed unusual, so my guess is that the two are related since they always go together.

Does anyone have something like this?

Any idea what they are?",21,2018-06-26 06:03:55 EDT-0400

452,Dont be me. A message to young people with anxiety.,"Im a late 40s guy who has lived with various forms of anxiety for a long time. 

I thought I could build a 'safe' life by avoiding. Constructing walls to keep the feelings of fear at bay. Keeping friends at a 'safe' distance. Staying up late at night so as to avoid daytime problems of the world. Work falling away. If I could just keep the fear and discomfort away 'today' I will let tommorow feel far away.

Except my tommorow has come. Living in a cold basement sleeping on bags of clothes. Only my phone and a cat by my side. I let anxiety master me, it tricked me into short term thinking and now my life is dark.

Dont be me. Deal with your issues. Dont avoid, the short term relief it brings is an illusion. Dont be me.

456,When i’m out in public by myself i feel like everyone is watching me and it makes me hyper-aware of my movements and extremely uncomfortable?,"I’m 23/F and I’ve only realized this in the past few years but it’s a feeling i had normalized for as long as i can remember.  
I feel like anytime i’m out in public that people are just watching me and so i’m hyper-aware of how i’m walking, where i’m putting my arms, and in general whatever i’m doing. 
But the thing is, It’s not really that i think people are viciously judging me, it just feels, for example, like i’m doing normal everyday things except there’s an stadium of people watching, like obviously you’d feel like your every move was being monitored and it’s extremely uncomfortable and tense. 
Even if i’m in the car by myself when i stop at a stoplight i think all the people in cars around me are looking at me, also i can’t walk my dogs in the daylight because i feel like everyone is watching me from their houses or cars that are driving by are watching me too. And when i’m at school walking around campus or in classes, and it’s ALL i think about in these situations. i can’t relax in any public setting alone and it’s so awful of a feeling that when i can avoid it i will. I wont even go sit in the library or go to the student union at school, i’ll go sit in my car instead (i’m in my senior year and i’ve been in the student union alone maybe 4x).
If i have to go in public alone i try to do whatever i have to, as fast as i can. Though when i’m with someone that i’m comfortable with i don’t really think about that at all or if i do it’s very very minimal. 
I would like to be able to go out and feel at ease when i do things like, go to the gym, walk my dogs, go to classes, go to the stores, go to the movie theatre,  etc. but I’ve been like this for so long i’m not even sure how i could get better at this point?

460,How to be supportive of employee with anxiety,"Hi all. Hoping someone can give me some advice. 

I have an employee, let’s call him Tim. Tim clearly has issues with anxiety. Occasionally mentions “needing a Xanax”. When under zero pressure, Tim is a fine employee, gets his work done mostly on time.

But the slightest application of pressure or stress seems to send him on a downward spiral. He turns mean, hostile, and often runs away. For example: if he’s running a tiny bit late on a deliverable, and I ask about it (not in a threatening way, I just want to know if there is a roadblock he needs my help to resolve), he shuts down completely, won’t talk to me, and spends the rest of the day slamming things around on his desk and muttering to himself. Sometimes he will disappear for a hour, might take the rest of the day off sick. Occasionally it’s bad enough that he’ll call off the next day or two entirely. 

I want to find a way to be supportive, but I’m struggling. I like Tim, and I try to be a good manager. But I also have a team to run, and work to be completed. I can’t keep walking on eggshells around him to avoid triggering his anxiety. 

I’ve had my own panic attacks in the past, I know they’re no joke. I’m not looking to fix him, or pretend like anxiety is an easy thing to “get over”. But I do need to find a better way that we can work together because it’s not a good situation today. Looking for any advice. Thanks!",52,2018-06-21 16:57:47 EDT-0400

On Saturday, I convinced myself to at least clean one of the smaller rooms. After I finished that, I don’t know why, but I just had a ton of motivation to clean the rest. So far, I’ve gotten several rooms clean, a ton of clothes folded and put away, and I finally set up my computer desk. Now, all that’s left to do is clean a couple more rooms, fold and put away another load of laundry, and then I’m done! I can’t believe I made myself completely miserable for months over something I’ll have completed in 1 weekend. I also realized something else today. I thought that going on the computer would keep me distracted from anxiety, but now I know that just doing anything but sitting there helps keep me distracted.

478,"Fear of existence, I think it could possibly be existential angst or depersonalization. Can someone help?","WARNING: I put trigger warning for those who deal with any type of existential dread or fear. If you’re like me, simply reading about it can set you off. But if you’re willing to, then please read.

Well I’m 18 years old. I’m a senior in high school and I’ve been kinda stressed out from one of my classes which I have a TERRIBLE grade in. I’ve been into Buddhism and spiritual stuff for a while. I’ve been meditating too, and experimented with shrooms one time (I’ll bring this up later). But lately I’ve been thinking so much about death and the ego and the human experience that I’ve been living with this dreadful perspective that’ll occasionally surface.

It might have something to do with video games. The reason I say this is because sometimes I question why I’m in this body. I question why existence exists. Why do I see? Why do I feel? Why am I in this body? What am I MEANT to do? What are the secrets? I know it’s a meaningless cycle of thought, but I simply cannot help myself.

It’s rarely ever SCARY. Most of the time it’s just uncomfortable. It just starts to feel awkward being in this body. Last night, I was researching stuff about it and found depersonalization, which didn’t sound exactly like what I have but it seems very similar. It was at night before bed. I was scrolling through photos and saw a drawing of a man in a room looking out of an eye, like he was inside of the head. This sat with me weirdly. 

So I put my phone away and tried going to sleep. And I couldn’t stop thinking about that picture. It made me think that seeing was really weird and could even be scary. Then I got really scared. It was the type of fear that you feel like nowhere’s safe, because that fear exists purely in your perspective. Then I started shaking really bad. I wanted to stop thinking about it. Eventually I calmed down. Then I started thinking about how weird it is that I have a mind, like everyone else. But I am ME. I think I felt isolated because of this. The human experience was really getting to me. I started shaking again, then I tried going to sleep, and was successful.

This fear was not unlike a pretty scary magic mushroom trip I had about a month ago. It awakened an existential fear. Every moment was torture because it was a moment. I was scared of the present. I was scared of existing, but scared of not existing. I don’t like talking about it much so I won’t go too in depth.

Of course, it’s not always like this. But general anxiety dictates that I go around every day scared of this fear. And of course, that means I think it’s always a threat. Makes me think it’s always SOMEWHERE. And that’s how it can come back.

I dunno. It could just be existential angst. Could be depersonalization. But it can be painful. I think I might start going to therapy for it. Can anyone offer any advice or help? I’m not asking for a diagnosis. Just wondering if I’m not alone, and what I should do. Thank you.",6,2018-11-13 16:54:53 EST-0500

I just don't know how to handle it or what to do. I am trying to get back into playing guitar, but even attempting it sends me into a downward spiral. All I can think about is I don't know where to start, that I will never be good at it. I played for about 3 years before stopping and quit it because all I could think about was how I wasn't any good at it. 

I dropped out of college after 4 years for similar reasons. Sitting in class made me feel overwhelmed. It got to the point I could no longer focus on studying or homework because all I could think about was how much of a screw up I was. This of course led to me failing classes, which only reinforced those thoughts and just turned into some vicious cycle. I can never get out of my own head to enjoy anything.

Maybe 10 of them max are they same things that I wrote down again but I have listed 114 triggers and beliefs that cause me anxiety and I have several rituals listed too. These rituals can cause me an immense amount of stress and paranoia when I don’t complete them. Hell, one of my biggest regrets was from almost a decade ago and...it’s about a leaf. I didn’t step on this leaf that I looked at and though, damn I should pay attention to that leaf and step on it because it needs my attention. I didn’t step on it because I already was doing that and my friends were annoyed by it. So  now that’s created weird rituals from having to touch things and walk in certain ways to avoid me thinking I didn’t care about an object and that I would

A) come back to haunt me in someway
B) determines if I go to Heaven or Hell based on performing or not performing these rituals I came up with in my head. 

Sometimes I can rationalize it, but it affects my day to day life. I try soo hard not to do it when I’m around people who don’t “get it”.  I feel like I hurt a pen’s feelings if I don’t use it frequently while taking notes. I just have this belief that inanimate objects have feelings to an extent and can control my after life and judgement by God. ",2,2018-11-08 02:09:21 EST-0500

He will get a prosthetic leg and he will learn how to walk without his leg. It'll be hard at first, very hard, and he might have a stupid limp for the rest of his life, but he will walk. Point is, there are chemical imbalances in your brain, but you can learn to cope with those chemical imbalances. just like a man would learn to cope without his leg. You're still gonna feel anxious sometimes, and some days will be harder than others, but you can do this. You are stronger than you think.""

To bring it down, I mean, and make it more manageable. I can totally understand why some or even most people would find that a majority of games are more anxiety inducing than they help; I certainly find this to be the case in a lot of cases, particularly online multiplayer games.

Anyways, the main ones that help me out are Persona 4 Golden and Celeste. They're both really beautiful, have lower difficulty settings so they can be breezed through, and have some really nice stories there. I don't want to say too much in case of spoilers, but they both certainly really helped me and were very pivotal in my life.

538,"Our dog died today. I'm going to miss her beyond words, but (at least) my anxiety is mostly calmed down.","I'm not entirely sure, if this is appropriate to post here, but I need to get it out and deemed it at least semi-relevant.

The health of your older dog (would have turned 11 in March) declined since last fall and even more since Christmas. I was constantly worried about her and felt so incredible helpless. She had two operation in the late fall and after Christmas we decided with our vet that we were going to just provide her pain therapy and don't put her through test after test and vet visit after vet visit, which would have stressed her massively and lessened her quality of life.

Tuesday started her health to decline even further, she refused to eat even her favourite treats and since yesterday evening she also denied water. We made it her as comfortable as possible, wetted her mouth, kept her warm and discussed an at home vet visit today, but then she died around noon. She didn't suffer long and was surrounded by most of us.

And while I'm going to miss her beyond words and trying to grieve and her death is also not helping my depression, most of the anxiety I felt for the last months and especially the last days has calmed down. Even though I worry now about our one year old dog and the rest of the family, I don't need to worry any longer about her, I am not helpless anymore and there is no more uncertainty. In the finality lies comfort. Now I can mourn her, keep her memory dear, let her go and eventually move forward. It hurts and the pain will never go away completely, but some day the joy of the memories will be greater than the sorrow.",32,2018-02-08 18:48:50 EST-0500
539,Does anyone else's anxiety hinder their creativity?,"I like to consider myself a creative person, I have really enjoyed painting, drawing, film making, photography, and p much every creative endeavor I can think of. Yet I barely do any of these things. It makes me feel very unsure of my identity, because I kind of feel like these things distinguish me, yet I don't do them very often. Every time I feel inspired, my negative self talk pushes me away from acting on it. Any time I'm faced with a blank sheet of paper I get anxious and worry about messing up or creating something ugly. I also ask myself what the point is, like, if it's not seen and liked by many people, what's the point? And logically, I know the point is to get lost in the act of creating, which I usually do if I can get past the initial anxiety, yet this thought always keeps me from starting.

541,I had a furious customer screaming in my face last saturday and I fainted from a panic attack. And I still can't let it go.,"I work as an All-Purpose Clerk in a grocery store, and this is actually the 2nd time I've had an incident like this. I worked at smaller store before, where I still had stress issues and panic attacks. But I've recently had to move to a much bigger and busier store with much more unruly customers. 

I also have G.A.D and A.D.D, which I've been trying to manage without medication because the last several that I've tried never worked. Or made things worse. So I just do my best to handle it.

It doesn't always go well. Case in point, an incredibly irate customer on Superbowl Weekend who was so furious that we didn't have cold 30packs of bud light that he got right up in my face, shouting me down and threatening me over it. With no managers available to help me or back me up, either.

I was already at a 200% panic level that day, and this just pushed it over the edge. I just had a complete stress-shutdown where I went limp and hit the floor. I had customers circling around, asking questions, touching me, trying to get me up, the angry customer just completely writing me off to yell at somebody else, and all I could do was just sob uncontrollably to myself on the floor in front of the *entire* front end. It was incredibly embarrassing (as I'm a grown man) and it left me pretty fucked up for a few days. 

*and It's been nearly a week and I can't seem to let it go.* My managers tell me it's something that happens all the time and I just need to forget about it, but it's really difficult for me. Now every time I walk in I'm just prepping myself for another encounter like that. 

And to be honest, I've wanted to leave this job for a long time, for years really. But I feel like I don't have a choice. Or that anywhere else I go will be just the same. I've had a few days off this week to cam down and relax, but now that I go back to work today I'm right back up there on the anxiety scale again. 

I'm not expecting any miracle advice, but I just don't know what to do with myself at this point. 

**Minor update:** I really appreciate the support from you guys, it helps me feel way less alone about it. Too many people I work with don't quite get that it's hard to just write off that kind of event and move on. 

I have actually been putting more effort into some better work. A majority of my job now is custodial, but I'm whatever they need at any given time. I've been looking into similar maintenance jobs at quieter places. For now, I'll just try to survive where I am until I get a bite from another employer. I've wanted out of this environment for a long time now, and I can't take too many more of these kinds of moments. ",31,2018-02-10 22:03:19 EST-0500

(Wow. just writing this out makes me realize how bad my anxiety can get)

It's strange because if someone else posted this and I read it, I wouldn't think the friend in this story hated me whatsoever, but when it happens to me it feels so real. It's exhausting sometimes.",18,2018-02-13 22:45:59 EST-0500

Today I woke up and had every excuse in the world to convince myself not to go - people will be watching me, think I look suspicious or awkward, or too fat, or see me sweating (I sweat profusely from anxiety in public, it's one of my worst defects) and think I'm creepy, people this, people that. I also didn't get a lot of sleep, so I wasn't in the best mood - usually a good reason to stay home and not do anything. But I knew I HAD to go outside more, or else I'm just going to become even more afraid. But maaaaan I really didn't wanna do anything today. I was debating back and forth whether or not to stay home, because I knew I didn't want to go outside, but I also knew I'd feel like shit if I didn't.

After about 10 minutes of back and forth arguing with myself, I thought ""just do it"". I'm not much of a Nike guy, so I'm not sure why it popped into my head, but in that moment it was actually decent advice. Just fucking do it. Get it over with. I might feel bad if I go outside and have a bad experience, but I'll definitely feel bad if I stay home because my anxiety says I need to. Just do it.

Within about 5 minutes I was out the door with my camera and tripod, and drove an hour to the beach. I planned on staying a few hours so I could get some nice sunset pictures, but unfortunately the weather sucked so that didn't work out - I didn't get any good pictures, actually. It was very bad lighting and I'm a little rusty. But it felt good to be using my camera again after such a long break, and none of the bad things I thought would happen actually happened while I was there. Nobody was looking at me weird, nobody even really noticed or cared that I was there (in a good way). Occasionally I'd walk by people and we'd just say ""hello"" as we passed. After spending so much time alone, just having that level of interaction with someone felt kind of nice, and it reminded me that not everyone is out to get me.

I left early because of the bad weather, but that's alright. I went out, did my thing and came back - that's more than I've done in weeks, so I guess any progress is a good thing. Baby steps.

I just thought I'd post this and maybe it'll help remind someone that you CAN get out and do the shit you want to do, even if your anxiety is trying to stop you. I really didn't want to go out today, but I feel a lot better right now than I would have if I decided to stay home. So yeah, **just fucking do it**.",31,2018-06-14 10:14:37 EDT-0400

On the other, I feel super bad about not pushing to hang out (which I know she would have been 100% fine with and probably even appreciated), that it’s been so long, I’m worried that we’re going to start drifting apart, I’m bummed that I’ll now spend Friday night and most of Saturday alone until my husband gets home from an overnight shift.

573,Almost cured my anxiety and would like to help others,"Over the last 6\-7 months i've almost completely cured my anxiety and would like to share my experience in hopes of helping others who are suffering from anxiety and depression. 

1. Exercise. You don't need a gym membership or fancy equipment. Climbing stairs is one of the best workouts out there. Back when I was 15, before I started working a shitty retail job I hated (which played a big part of my anxiety), I used to go running twice a day, chasing after that runners high. There are few better feelings in the world than getting the heart rate up and getting a runner/cardio high. Even just going for a short walking break helps. Humans are meant to sit behind a desk at a computer all day long.
2. Food and Fasting. Changing my diet has probably been the biggest help in fighting anxiety. I used to eat cereal ever day for breakfast, and eat a lot of carbs (pasta, pizza, rice, bread, potato chips, french fries) for lunch/dinner/snacks, as well as a lot of sugar. We aren't cows, drinking the milk of another animal isn't natural. Milk with cereal as well as the carbs I was eating throughout the day drained me of my energy and made me feel really bloated. Except for 1 or 2 cheat days a week, I started time restricted eating and have felt a lot better and more energetic. I only eat and drink between 11am and 7pm (exception being drinking water) and fast the other 16 hours. My diet now consist's of lots of fruits and vegetables (often in smoothies), lots of eggs and a lot of meat.
3. Less screen time. I completely avoid looking at any screens (phone, laptop, you name it) for the first hour I'm awake and for the last hour before I go to bed. My brain feels a lot more present and at ease. I do some basic stretching instead.
4. Feeling a sense of accomplishment and getting things done. If you know something needs to be done and it'll take you less than two minutes, don't wait, just do it. There a few better feelings in the world than when you accomplish something, even if it's something trivial and meaningless. Make your bed. Shave. Do whatever chores you know need to be done and do them right away.
5. Use a planner. Every night before bed I take out my calendar and write out when I'm going to do the next day, which helps to keep me focused and honest with myself throughout the day. Make sure to write down me time as well.
6. Try something new/do something that sucks everyday. You never know what will happen. Traveling made me realize that I want to be an actor/filmmaker, so I started going to acting auditions for student films and writing my own scripts. While the idea of acting may seem horrifying to someone with social anxiety, it's one of the best things you can do. Acting forces you to be present, to remember the lines and be in your characters head, not your own. My first audition was terrible, but I felt a huge rush afterwards. I survived the experience. With each audition, I became more comfortable in front of people and the camera. I was terrified, but moving past my fear got me cast in two short films.
7. When you are faced with something difficult, stop and ask yourself if you're giving up because it's hard, or if you just aren't interested. I'm a university drop out who's tried learning computer programming 3 times in the hope of getting a decent job. I quit each because I hate it and I know that it won't make me happy. I've recently started taking parkour lessons for fun. Will it land me a career? Probably not, but it's fun and incredibly difficult with straightforward goals to strive for. Go into a new experience knowing that you suck, which means that you can only get better it you stick with it (assuming that you enjoy the new experience).
8. As I mentioned earlier, fight past your fear. Dealing with anxiety or depression is a marathon, not a sprint. Take small steps. Do you walk down the street looking at your phone and you move a few feet to the side when someone approaches in your direction and get upset over how awkward you were? That was me for a long time. Start by continuing to walk straight instead of walking a few feet to the side. Once you're comfortable walking like that, leave the phone in your pocket. After that say hello. It'll probably come out as you mumbling. THAT'S OK, you're improving. Being able to start up a twenty minute conversation with everyone isn't the goal.
9. Every night before bed, I always think of something positive that happened during the day. Something that happened to me, something I did for someone, something someone did for me, something I did to progress my life forward, something I learned. It my seem small, but outlook has a huge impact on your life. I always get annoyed when I hear someone say to just be happy. Even if you had a bad day, at least one good thing happened. Go to sleep focusing on the good thing that happened. Perception breeds reality. 

Podcast have been a huge help for me in learning to try different things, being more health conscious and positive.  I highly recommend listening to the Joe Rogan Experience episodes with Dr Rhonda Patrick and David Goggins as well as the Jocko podcast with Dr Jordan Perterson. I hope this post can help someone get better. ",9,2018-06-09 02:30:40 EDT-0400

577,"This is to all the people who are jobless, skipping classes, or completely hopeless in life because of anxiety disorders","My life is far, very far from perfect. But I want to share something.

I graduated high school in 2014. I was a terrible student. I skipped classes like nobody else did. Not because I am “lazy”, but because my anxiety was so high that it totally hindered my ability to stay in class. 

After I graduated, I spent 2015 and 2016 housebound. Agoraphobic,  depressed and fucked up, with no perspective in life. I never imagined I could even enter the room where an university entrance exam would be applied. And I mean it. I couldn’t imagine myself there. I couldn’t even go to the supermarket that is literally in front of my house. 

A miracle happened by the end of 2016. I decided to take an exam, just to TRAIN. To see if I could stay locked in a room with other people for hours. I never expected to pass the exam. I never expected be able to get into the *best university of the continent I’m from*. I still don’t believe in it... kind of. 2017 was like a dream or something to me. I still can’t believe I made it.

I still have problems. Many problems. I am still anxious, and my anxiety is still an obstacle in my daily routine. However...

I am not hopeless anymore. I can look to the horizon and see a brighter future. I can see myself graduating, I can see myself in a job, and I can see myself slowly getting more socially confident. I feel I can make it.

Please, never, never give up on yourself. Even if you are housebound or jobless, skipping all of your classes, even if nobody else around you believe in you, keep going. You are much stronger than you think you are, I guarantee it. I experienced it. Just put yourself in a situation where you have the possibility of improving and making some kind of progress.

EDIT: I’m so glad this message somehow helped and inspired some people. I wish the best for all of you. You can and *will* dominate anxiety.",35,2018-01-16 04:25:00 EST-0500

Meanwhile I'm over here actually suffering from diagnosed bipolar disorder. The same disorder that led me to an actual suicide attempt.

Sorry I know this post is kind of negative, but it's something that's been weighing on my mind recently. It's not my intention to downplay anyone's ACTUAL anxiety or mental illness. I just hate the whoring out mental illness for likes. Everyone gets anxious sometimes, and everyone gets sad, doesn't fucking mean you have disorders. Sorry I just had to vent.

595,How I got rid of my anxiety,"This is my own personal experience of dealing with anxiety and I want to share it because it's very effective for me and maybe it will be a good fit for somebody else.

Ever since I was a young kid, I would have obsessive thoughts about irrational fears that would cause me immense anxiety that would lead to depression and hopelessness. My fears would vary from week to week. Sometimes I'd be worried about having mouth cancer, another time I'd be worried about being falsely accused of rape, etc. The common trend was that the fear was always totally irrational and made up but felt completely real.

I have completely gotten rid of my anxiety and for the past 6 months, I have never felt anxious or depressed.

I eventually started to break down my anxiety into two pieces. The ""fearful thought"" and the ""bodily vibrations"". 

These two pieces amplify each other. The stronger the bodily vibrations feel, the stronger the fearful thought becomes. And the more vivid the fearful thought becomes, the more unpleasant the bodily vibrations are. 

If you aren't consciously aware of this, the anxiety will hurt more. 

Once you separate the two, the anxiety will lessen. It will not go away yet, by any means, but the magnitude of discomfort it gives will be lessened.

Once you've broken it up into these two pieces, you can deal with them individually. Think of the fearful thought as a hologram. It can take on an infinite form of frightening shapes and forms. It can create very vivid images in your mind. But it cannot ever hurt you. This is the important thing to understand. It can annoy you and it can scare you, but it can't actually hurt you. When you feel anxious, it's because the hologram has confused you and made you believe that the thought itself is a real danger but it's not. You have to consciously think about this and eventually you'll realize that no matter what this thought hologram does to you, it is no actual danger. Dealing with the annoying aspect of it is frankly annoying but when something goes from seeming like a danger to becoming a simple annoyance, you will already feel less anxious. And eventually it won't even be an annoyance because you won't pay attention to it.

The bodily vibrations are easier to deal with than the fearful thought. Try to visualize the vibrations as a pleasurable body orgasm or massage inside your stomach. Remind yourself that each bodily sensation is just a vibration that means nothing. Just because it feels scary doesn't mean it is harmful. The only reason it feels scary is because you associate the bodily vibration with the fearful thought but the fearful thought is always false and deceptive. 

I may update this. But I really hope this helps someone out. Anxiety sucks big time but once you free yourself from it, life feels like it's supposed to feel again. You feel like a happy, careless child. But you often forget how life is supposed to feel if you're scared all the time.

 I want to send you a message of support in this sea of frustration, panic, and uncertainty. I wish I knew the exact words to help everyone who's in one of these positions today, to be able to make a positive impact in your life, and give you solace. Unfortunately, I can't, but I want you to know that mistakes and slip ups don't define you. Sometimes anxiety is so powerful it feels the only way to drown it out is to mindlessly scroll on your phone, or to have that beer you said you wouldn't have. Being on this subreddit in the first places means you have made a conscious decision to seek support and self improvement. You can get through these days, and if you feel like you can't, please seek out professional help. You are worth it. 

 I had one of those self sabotage days today. My social anxiety has been crippling, I skipped the gym, smoked those cigs I planed to toss out, and spent today watching youtube videos instead of doing my work. I know that on these days seeing a post like this would help me, and that's why I'm writing this, so people in my situation today can see that they aren't alone this Sunday. 

Cheers to making it though these nasty days, and to here's to knowing we'll get through this.

607,"Co-workers were down playing anxiety yesterday. Pisses me off when I hear ""everybody has some kind of anxiety.""","To clarify, I don't have anxiety. But my husband does. I've seen first hand what it can do to someone. 

At work yesterday (I'm at a salon) my co-workers were gossiping about some former co-worker of theirs and talking about how much of an attention whore she was and how she's nothing but crazy and drama. Apparently this person is currently asking for money on a go fund me page so that she can get a companion dog. She also says that he would need training to help her with her panic attacks, night terrors, and bringing her medicine to her. I thought to myself, what's the big deal? 

But then they started saying things like ""oh she just wants attention,"" ""everybody has some form of anxiety,"" etc. I piped in and explained that things like panic disorder were a real problem for some people and that it's more than just everyday anxiety. The response I got was ""well we know this girl, she just wants  attention. ""Nobody with actual anxiety would actually tell other people about it."" 

Now I don't even know this person they were talking about. Maybe she does just want attention. But maybe, just maybe, she is desperate at this point and is finally reaching out about her problem. Maybe a go fund me isn't the most practical approach, but it makes me so angry whenever people act like mental health is no big deal or just a way to get attention. I see the stories you guys post here. I have seen my own husband's anxiety and how it affects him. This shit sucks, and it's real. ",78,2018-04-26 16:19:31 EDT-0400

623,I hate who i've become due to anxiety,"Just thought I'd share a little incident that happened at work today:

Some co-workers were talking about who the ""weirdest"" person in the office is. I was doing my work but still listening intently. I was waiting for silent pauses because surely they were trying to be secretive whilst talking about me. One of them mentioned that being weird is a good thing, then - ""Normal is boring."" About a minute or so later one of them said out loud ""(my name) is pretty normal"" jokingly. I smiled, nodding slightly in agreement (I am a fucking pansy). My other co-worker then basically said that I was the most normal person she'd ever met ""like a perfectly normal, humanoid carbon copy"" etc. A robot, I thought to myself.

Fear of rejection and social anxiety has dulled who I truly am, and I am now considered the ""boring"" guy. I felt completely gutted by this remark, although I'm sure she didn't intend to have this effect. And further, it's not like I'm unaware of how awkward, quiet, and nervous I am. I ride on the coattails of being a ""nice guy,"" at least that is something going for me, but I am slowly becoming more sensitive, angrier, less in tune with my sense of humor (I could go on...), etc. I felt like crying in the office.

628,I utterly hate it when someone tells me that I am wrong. Not because I want to be right but because it makes me feel that I am an idiot or inadequate,"I assume that everyone else wants to be right about something and I assume that everyone feels sad when they find out that they are wrong and my judgement tells me that the average person manages to accept it and get it over.

But good Lord, when I come to the realisation that I was wrong about something, whether it was a random thought or something that was carefully thought, I feel a deep anxiety and deep insecurity and eventually, I start to panic and cannot think at all, almost like I suddenly became an idiot or my IQ score dropped my 30 points. 

I am not sure why this happens to me and why I feel like I am personally attacked or feel like I am punched in the stomach when I find out that I was wrong about something 

*(my judgement tells me that either it is because I was raised in a semi-strict background with pushy parents where if you are not on the right, then you are definitely on the wrong; or because I am someone who always took school seriously and when school events are involved like exams or even a classroom interaction, if you posted the wrong answer or the wrong statement, then that means that you are definitely wrong and you get a lower score and in turn, that score affects your self-worth and self-confidence in your ability on whether you are able to think critically)*

But holy fucking God, the fucking of insecurity and despair and the ultimate feeling of self-betrayal and shame just feels like I am somehow struck by lightning and I feel like I am shocked from the inside and cannot move or think or feel.

630,Is anyone else constantly irritable?,"One of the most common ways my anxiety chooses to manifest itself is through severe irritability. One wrong word from anyone, one minor inconvenience is enough to ruin my entire day, sometimes culminating in panic. 

I guess I know the solution is consciously calming myself down through breathing, etc. It’s just so hard to break through the overwhelming anger. Once the intrusive thoughts start, it’s hard to shut them up.

But when I did to to sleep, it was like my heartbeat wouldn't slow down and i could feel it throughout my entire body for hours and hours all night. Now i usually have trouble sleeping cuz my mind won't shut off but not this weird heartbeat problem too. It was so aggravating, but maybe it was all in my head? If so, how do I make it go away?

Usually I avoid these situations at all cost and will pick the job that there is a lesser chance of me having to be acknowledged by the man. Not because he is a bad guy, just because I freak out and think I am going to do something stupid. But today was different. I just continued to work like it was nothing. 

As he walked in our department I could feel the tension between everyone. Basically they wanted this over with because of the pressure they were putting on themselves.   For some reason there was 2 bundles of star balloons behind me as I was working. I ignored them because I am guessing they had some purpose. Well, it was my turn. He was making his way through and finally saw me. He said “ hi, nice to meet you. Are you the star of the day?” As he reached out his hand. Obviously, in reference to the giant balloons behind me. Without hesitation I shook his hand and said “everyday”. 

It finally broke the tension in the department and everyone including him enjoyed it. I went from someone that would never even say a word to this man 2 years ago to someone that showed confidence while approaching him. I’m going to call this a win today. ",21,2018-02-17 04:15:55 EST-0500

And it was great!,"So for the last couple of years I've become less and less active, mainly due to finding myself a lone parent with zero free time and zero money.  Also the local pool closed down so I could no longer go swimming, and my ex kept my dog and I can't own one now I'm in rented housing...so a lot conspired to make sedentary life creep up on me.(sort of, I still walk at least an hour a day as I have no car) 

Anxiety had been creeping in. Then the more wired and hypersensitive I become, the more depressed I feel. It's a viscous cycle.

Today I got home from work and I'd had a busy day. But forced myself to take my youngest for a long walk. She's very energetic and chatty so it just made it easier. If already walked 4 miles during the day and we walked another three. Tomorrow I'm going to do a longer walk and build it up.

Also, I signed up to learn how to brew beer at the local Museum, a two day class. Day one is on Tuesday and day two is at the end of the month. 

I've never just said ""Eh, I want to do it, doesn't matter if I don't have anyone to do it with"" and just signed up for anything like this. I always stop if I can't find anyone to do it with me. But I figure if I live life like that, I'll never get to do anything I want to do ever. 

I'm excited, I'm nervous... But it's almost like a *good* nervousness.",36,2018-03-05 06:31:03 EST-0500
659,Anyone else ever doubt their own anxiety?,"I always feel like I'm overblowing my issues in my own mind. I tell myself ""You're fine"", but not in the reassuring way. Like I'm not a constant nervous wreck so I don't deserve to be heard or even that I have any actual issues because I've never been diagnosed. It's like a negative feed back loop. ""I have no actual mental issues, I'm subconciously doing this for attention,"" and it makes me nervous, I then get emotional and think there is an issue, but then after I calm down I tell myself that there's nothing wrong all over again. I'm sorry if I'm overexplaining a bit, this is the first time I've tried to manifest this feeling in words.",37,2018-03-07 04:09:05 EST-0500
660,Ever feel so tired that you're actually too anxious to sleep?,"I'm always tired, no matter how much/well I've slept, or health condition, time of day, etc. But sometimes I'm so tired that I'm actually afraid to go to sleep. I feel this anxiety in the pit of my stomach that makes me too nervous to go to sleep. It's also sometimes accompanied by a sense of guilt for no apparent reason, or at least none I can think of anyway.

Does anyone else experience this?",26,2018-03-02 07:10:49 EST-0500
661,Is anyone else unable to do anything mentally exhausting when they have to leave the house later?,"Unless my day is completely open, I have a hard time doing anything mentally productive. I can do chores, make food, eat food, organize, bla bla. The problem happens when I need to spend my time reading, studying, learning, doing something that needs mental focus. Even after I have come home, I need time to crash and regain energy from being outside. I can't do much that requires concentration. 

For example: If I have a Doctor's appointment at 11am then I won't do anything leading up the appointment. Let's say if I need to go to the Doctor at 11am then go somewhere else at 1pm. I am unable to use my time wisely between 12pm-1pm. I would spend that hour slacking around, unable to work on maybe an assignment or project. 

Does anyone else experience this and have ways to combat it?

I feel like a sloth. I need so much downtime to do the bare minimum. It doesn't matter how much time I spend resting though, that time does not get banked for the next day.",29,2018-03-01 17:56:06 EST-0500

666,Living by the “one minute” rule,"Hey all. I recently discovered something that’s been helping with my generalized anxiety, so I figured I’d share here in the hope that other people can benefit as well. It’s called the “one minute” rule, and it basically goes like this: If [whatever task] is going to take you one minute or less, do it *now*. As in, *this very moment*. I decided to take the plunge with this, and *wow* - it was great! Little tasks that I normally would procrastinate on were finally getting done - stupid little things like texting a friend back (normally very anxiety-inducing for me) or putting my plate right into the dishwasher after I finished eating. 

Since it worked so well for me, I’ve expanded the scope to include tasks that take *five* minutes or less. Today, for example, I changed the laundry over, tidied up the kitchen sink, made a work-related phone call that I had been dreading, and called a friend to make dinner plans. Now that might not seem like a lot, but for me, that’s a *huge* deal. 

These little tasks really add up, and getting things accomplished is giving me the confidence to tackle larger projects. It’s really making a difference in my everyday stress levels. Anyway, thanks for reading. Give this a try (even just for *one day*), and let me know in the comments how it works for you!",19,2018-03-02 20:56:38 EST-0500

681,So I’m having brain surgery,"My tongue has been completely numb and tingling and burning for 6 months. I’ve always had bad anxiety so I just brushed it off as an anxiety symptom. After seeing many doctors I finally figured out today that it isn’t an anxiety symptom and it’s actually an abnormality in my brain causing nerve damage to my tongue requiring the repositioning of a vessel in my brain. So now instead of graduating high school with all of my friends I will have to shave my head and have actual brain surgery, pretty terrifying.

682,Ive finally snapped,"A little background for context. I'm 23 yo male and an assistant accountant. 

I had to walk out of my probation meeting today due to a panic attack because the stress has seriously broken me down physically and mentally.

I've told them I'm going to be off for a while and they would get a note from my doctor. My parents picked me up and my dad instantly just started to criticise me and I snapped, I yelled at him and got out of the car. Paced around a car park and called a mental health crisis team. I told them how I'd been feeling and they've recommended I go on anti depressants and will send a letter of recommendation to my doctor but I cant get an appoint until the 14th.

I feel like I've truly gone mental, I'm definitely more paranoid and I'm on such a short fuse I'll get angry at anybody that slightly irritates me. But I don't feel like my feelings are unjustified, or irrational. How I'm dealing with them is totally irrational but the underlying problems to me seem reasonable. I'm wound up so tight with stress from work and I have chest pains and headaches and struggle to not have a panic attack on an almost daily basis. It's worth noting I'm the third person this year to now take sick leave because of stress. I think it might 4 but the other instance could be pure speculation. But they just keep trying to shift blame to me by saying I'm unorganised and I don't manage my time effectively, so I improved upon it, I went to a seminar they suggested, I started to do better and more work was getting done. But it was still too much, I've been working early mornings and late nights most days and it's still not getting done. They just keep criticising me whilst also telling me not to do the extra hours.

I'm posting because i don't feel like there's anyone to talk to. I start to tell people my problems and all they do is just criticise me or give me advice that is completely useless and then get upset because I can't ""just forget about it"" and ""stop worrying about it"". Because I've led a pretty privileged life as far it goes, I've never had struggles in life like some people, so I get told ""other people have it worse"". I didn't realise there was a competition as to who deserves to be the most miserable, it's like they're telling me I'm not allowed to feel like I do.

I'm hoping I can be referred to therapy and that the medication will help although I'm very worried about that.

697,Zoloft is changing my life,"Side note: I was on Lexapro a year ago and it started working in a week so I have a history of SSRI's working quick for me. It helped but it didn't work as well.

So I started Zoloft last month and let me tell you, my life has been infinitely better. I'm able to connect with my partner so much better and our relationship has grown 10x stronger as a result. But that's not the best part, I can actually hold a conversation now! Talking to people is coming so naturally now and I even make small talk with store workers. Before Zoloft I'd avoid entire aisles with employees in fear that they'd ask if I needed help finding anything. I'm also able to concentrate on song lyrics for the first time in my life. Before I only listened to music for the music part so I would usually listen to electronic genres without any lyrics. Now I'm feeling an emotional impact from songs that I've never experienced before. 

I feel normal and genuinely happy with life and I've never been able to say that before. Thank you Zoloft.

**Edit:** 2 more things I forgot to mention. Writing/speaking my mind comes 100x easier. I had to drop my ENG-1A class the other semester because I just couldn't write. I drew blanks and it took me hours to write up a paragraph. Now I feel confident I can get through school if I try again. The other thing is that my memory went from ""Do I have dementia?"" to ""How the heck did I manage to remember that?"" This is probably a stress level thing (since high levels of stress can cause bad short term memory) and not from Zoloft directly but I still feel like I should mention it.

**Editt:** I also want to mention that your anxiety *can* get worse before it gets better upon starting any SSRI. This was the case for me. I had a full blown panic attack at a restaurant a week in and then dissociated for a solid 2 hours. I tried asking my psychiatrist for a benzo to take the edge off because my other doctor did that with Lexapro but he didn't want to prescribe anything possibly addictive after only 1 visit.

They've since tried to apologise for their behaviour, and other friends have tried to encourage me to forgive them and reconnect with them. But I refuse to. I have some amazing people in my life who far more deserve my attention.

716,Feelings of guilt for no reason,"Hi, 

Does anyone ever have feelings of misplaced guilt they just can never shake. Or maybe this isn't guilt.

I always feel guilty about everything. No matter what happens, even if it's nothing to do with me, I just end up taking on those feelings of guilt.

An example was that our team at work was told off as a whole for the comments of a few. Despite not being the one to say any of these comments, I felt guilt, despite having nothing to do with this.

It's strange and no matter how logical I try to be with myself, I can't shake the yucky feelings of guilt. 

Does anyone else experience this? Has anyone ever been able to shake this? I do have an anxiety disorder as well, so I'm an anxious person by nature.

720,I have finally figured out a coping strategy and I feel better than ever!,"Hi all, 

I guess the goal of this post is twofold -  to share in my excitement with a community who understands the hell of anxiety and to maybe offer a little bit of hope for those of you are are struggling: 

At 25 years old, I think I have finally found a way for my GAD/OCD and I to coexist peacefully. 

A year ago, I would never have been able to make a post like this because my OCD would have told me that it would “make something bad happen.” 

The reason why I’m feeling better isn’t some miracle cure or surprise. It’s just a combination of medication and therapy. I say “just” because it is what is so often recommended, but I know the word “just” makes it seem a lot easier to obtain than it is in reality. I feel so much for all of you who are unable to access affordable therapy in your communities, or to whom healthcare is out of reach in general. There is a big flaw in our society. I struggled with getting the help I needed for years. This is what my journey looked like: 

Five different therapists until I finally found one who I click with. 

My first time in therapy was in university around seven years ago. I felt like I couldn’t make any progress because I could not stop sobbing uncontrollably in therapy sessions. I remember my school-appointed therapist just staring back at me, blankly. 

My second time in therapy was a similar experience. Too many tears. So for long, I wondered what exactly was wrong with me. This couldn’t be normal, could it? 

My third time in therapy was with a mindfulness specialist. I had no choice in who I was matched with because it was done with a government program that I had access to because of certain aspects of my childhood. I do not EVER want to criticize any approach to therapy that helps anyone, and I have close friends who have been helped by mindfulness. Personally, though, it does nothing for me. Being told to breathe as a way to combat the crippling social anxiety I felt during a hectic retail job left me feeling nothing but infuriated. 

The fourth therapist was a CBT psychologist who I was lucky to see through work benefits at the time (I HATED the job but the mental health benefits were good). He meant well, but we just didn’t vibe. I think he did more harm than good to be honest. 

My fifth and current therapist is actually a marriage counsellor, but it’s a wonderful fit for me because a lot of the things I need to work out are related to anxious attachment and distrust of men/relationships. It’s very very hard work. Sometimes I leave a session feeling so drained that I can barely speak afterwards. Sometimes I leave a session and feel like no work has been done at all. But yet I also have those moments, the ones that usually hit me out of nowhere, where I realize that something that would have torn me apart before is simply managable now. 

My coping routine also includes some medication. It really, really helps me and I would never want somebody to feel ashamed of being on meds, but I won’t mention the specific med type and dosage on here because really EVERYONE is different and it’s a decision that should be made with a doctor. 

Speaking of doctors, I know that mental health can be a really difficult thing to talk about in a clinic - my doctor certainly isn’t perfect - but I do have faith in medicine and its potential to help. My doctor said something to me that felt a bit harsh at the moment but has become a mantra of sorts for me now. She told me that there is no cure - only management. For a long time I felt the implications of this were so stark, but I promise promise promise, it can get better. Anxiety is a part of you, but it is not all of you. You are so valuable and so capable of feeling better. You deserve so much to feel good. 

All the best vibes. ",5,2018-04-21 15:51:42 EDT-0400
721,ANXIOUS MEN - GET YOUR TESTOSTERONE LEVELS CHECKED. HELPED ME SO MUCH,"Last year I lost 50 pounds (215-165) because I was so anxious that I could not eat, sleep, or take care of myself. I could hardly get out of bed. Sex drive was almost non existent (AND I WAS 18). Got my blood levels checked and had the testosterone of a 70 year old - it was an issue of my pituitary gland which is very common. Long story short, I went on testosterone replacement therapy for 6 months (just a rub on gel every day) and boom, immediately put weight back on, sex drive back, and the crazy thing, MY ANXIETY WAS ALMOST COMPLETELY GONE. I have some anxiety still but it is 1% of what it was. I urge you to get your hormone and vitamin levels checked. Even something as small as having a Vitamin B12 deficiency can cause you to go into deep depression and anxiety.

722,"The ""mental fog"" that makes you question your intelligence...","One of the strongest symptoms of my anxiety is a sort of mental fog that makes me forget things I should easily remember... like words I've used commonly in the past, certain facts or things I learned in school, names I should remember, etc. 

For example, I talk to myself regularly when I'm alone. I vocally express my thoughts. It helps to get them out. But lately when I'm having these private monologues, I spend more time thinking of a particular word I'm looking for than completing a thought. In turn, this gets me thinking that I'm losing my mind, and it spirals.

It can be really discouraging for me to think back to a college class (for example) and not remember a single thing I learned (even though it was only a few months back). But then, at times, I can clearly remember the things I want to. It's such a strange phenomenon; one that brings me down quite often lately.

If anyone has similar experiences with this, I'd appreciate reading them. Thanks!",28,2018-04-15 08:46:00 EDT-0400
723,Anyone go their whole life anxiety free until about 18-20?,"My life until 19 years old was anxiety free. I didn't even know what anxiety was. I would happily get on planes, no problem taking exams, could smoke cigarettes, drink coffee and alchohol without a second of anxious feelings. Then all of a sudden a week before my nineteenth birthday, I started experiencing frequent panic attacks and near constant feelings of anxiety. I stopped eating, going out, and exercising and had to move back in with my parents. I've been dealing with these symptoms for 6 months and frequently contemplate suicide. Its weird how much my life has changed in such a short time. Tried Zoloft with no success and benzo's which gave me uncomfortable side effects (low heart rate, depressed breathing). I improve marginally each month but am still nowhere close to before.

728,"DAE get stomach cramps from anxiety, even just mild, that throw off your hunger cues and also maybe your body image?","I get nagging cramps (That I once thought was some sort of gluten or dairy allergy...nope!) when going through an anxious week.

I track calories more carefully these weeks because I’m afraid I’m not getting enough to eat. 

It also fucks with my body image, because I AM a little more bloated those days and it just makes me uncomfortable. 

No IBS or anything digestion-related here. Just... this full and uncomfortable feeling. No amount of “clean eating” etc can make it better. I understand the anxiety is causing it, but it snowballs into screwing with my head and hunger!

737,I hate living in a third-world country!,"I live in Indonesia, a Muslim-majority country. This country claims to be multicultural and diverse, but it's so hard because Muslim-majority oppresses the non-Muslim majority. Including **me, an agnostic**. Please read: https://www.reddit.com/r/unpopularopinion/comments/7z5ftf/most_people_dont_know_the_truth_about_islam/

This country is so backwards is so many ways. Economically, we don't have a lot of citizens with good education and skills. We are basically 40% uneducated people without job or skill. Socially, we are very close-minded, we are anti-LGBT, anti-interfaith relationships. The government don't pursue high quality education for the citizens. Politically, religion infiltrates every aspect of politicians leading the nation, to the point that Muslim voters will only vote for Muslim politicians that leads under Muslim rules when Indonesia is not a Muslim country!

I am an open-minded person with international views and believes. I am currently pursuing higher education and plan to leave the country when I can because I can't stand living here. People are so dumb and they never want to learn to be better.

People here don't care about knowledge. They don't care about scientific truths, they just want to protect their majority religion. I'm really scared that in a few years, if I can't get out of this country, it will turn to a Muslim country. I hate this country will every fiber of my being. I hate being born here. Since I was a little girl, I never agreed to most ideals that people of this country holds. I've always had a different view that doesn't align with the majority, mostly open-minded views.",58,2018-02-25 17:27:11 EST-0500
738,'I have an anxiety disorder' is a perfectly valid reason to be anxious.,"Being anxious about a thing for no other reason than 'I have an anxiety disorder' is a valid reason to be anxious about the thing. 

I find myself going along the self hatred route when I don't have a logical reason to be anxious about a thing, with thoughts along the lines of 'Wow I'm so pathetic for feeling this way' and 'What's wrong with me this is so stupid I shouldn't be having a problem with this thing!' 

These thoughts aren't helpful. These types of thoughts have never once helped to motivate me to make a positive change in my life. The only function of thoughts like these is to make myself suffer because the depression side of me says that I need to make myself pay for being a bad person. (Also illogical and untrue, but that voice is still there)

What HAS been helpful are thoughts like 'Well I legitimately have an illness, that illness is a perfectly good explanation for why I have anxiety'. The less I beat myself up internally the more progress I make in my life, which honestly still doesn't make much sense to me but it's working so I'm gonna keep going with the being kind to myself thing. :)",29,2018-02-27 19:02:41 EST-0500

753,"Nothing has felt real for over the course of a month, it feels like I am constantly tripping on acid, very worried","Hi. For the past month I've been experiencing very scary symptoms. It is making it almost impossible for me to go about my daily tasks and social settings with work and being with my roommate/friends. 

&#x200B;

**A little bit of background of how this all started before I get into the details:** 

I just graduated college and got my degree in accounting this past May and have moved to a very fun city mid June. I soon found a job shortly after moving. Everything was going great, my roommate (who I met my senior year of college) and all of our friends who moved down here after graduation were having a blast. Going to concerts, the bars, etc. I am a very social guy, love being around people and am always the life of the party. I love bringing people together. About a month into this job I unexpectedly get fired. I received no feedback what so ever and was pretty shocked that they decided to part ways with me after such a short time. Especially for a new grad. Luckily, I am pretty tenacious and found a new (current) accounting job about two weeks later.  I was enjoying this new job, doing well, we were all still having an amazing time. Then, it all started out of absolutely nowhere. 

&#x200B;

**The symptoms:**

I think this happened a little bit before Halloween. I woke up for work one day and felt...different. I still feel like this way to this day and it has not subsided. I felt extremely numb and dizzy all the time. Everything is echoing and everything seems so distant. My surroundings look extremely vivid, way more than usual. Everything is brighter. The absolute scariest symptom for me so far is lack of comprehension. People will be talking to me sometimes and their words will sound kind of muffled to me and not make any sense. I think they are saying completely different things than what they are actually saying. Sometimes I think people are talking and saying my name even though they are not. This has happened at work many times and at home and any other social setting. It doesn't sound like my voice when I talk. It sounds separate from my body and not like it is coming from me if that makes sense. I can't comprehend stuff I am reading sometimes as well, it will take me a long time to make sense of it sometimes. Sometimes I will see brief shadows out of the corner of my eye. Things in my peripheral also seem like they are moving extremely fast, but when I look, they slow down. 

&#x200B;

**What I have done about this:**

I am very lucky to have such open and loving parents. I have told them everything about my situation and they are worried but very understanding and are trying to give me advice, ""it's all in your head, etc."" I understand that, but when I had anxious thoughts in my mind before this all happened, it would subside quickly. This has been going on for a month so I am beginning to think it is something more serious than my thoughts. I have also seen a doctor twice in the past month and told her all her symptoms. They took blood/urine samples and everything was normal. This past Friday she prescribed me 50mg of Zoloft and is setting me up for counseling with a therapist. I know I won't feel the effects of Zoloft for at least two weeks. I have also stopped smoking weed and am limiting myself to two beers for the rare occasions that I do go out these days. 

&#x200B;

**In conclusion:**

It feels like I am living a permanent acid trip and I am absolutely terrified. I am so scared being at work hunkered down in my cubicle. Nothing seems real to me and I am worried someone might think that I am going crazy. My personality has changed significantly. I am more paranoid then ever and am secluding myself from social situations. I am afraid to interact with people anymore because nothing makes sense to me and nothing seems real. I am worried this is my new state of mind and I will be like this for ever. I am just reaching out to see if anyone else has experienced this and would be willing to give me some insight.

755,What to do when.,"* You barely talk to people

* Too scared to go outside unless you have to for work, dentist appointment etc

* Stay at home 24/7 all the rest of the time

* Too scared to go to the doctor to seek help for depression

* Too scared to create creative and share it with the public because you fear it being judged and criticised as well as judging it yourself so you just work on things at home when you can bring yourself to work on them 10% or less of your whole time staying at home because it's too difficult to not procrastinate or stay focused especially when trying to learn something you are finding difficult to learn.

* Too scared to be in a relationship. Because I can't talk to women other than If I need to reply to something. As well as I know I probably won't change my living conditions or my depression so I don't wan't to be a burden to them like my father is to my mother. I might stay motivated for a week or more but I would probably loose motivation and go back to the shit state I'm in.

* Too scared to die but not motivated enough to live, just survive

Feel like every step I read to help yourself out on websites I just ignore or am not motivated by. As if every piece of info just works with somebody else but no matter what people say or instruct it's never going to get me out of how I'm living right now and how I feel.",2,2018-12-03 00:04:10 EST-0500

My PTSD intensified and caused a fear of law enforcement when I was by caught with weed and arrested and put on probation for 2 years. Part of the requirements of my probation was a 3 day stay in jail. This jailtime was traumatizing because, in my anxiety during the intake, I said I self harm. This caused them to strip me and keep me in a foam padded cell with no mattress/bedding and nothing but a Velcro dress for all 3 days. I had to ask permission to shower with a guard watching me.

During this time, I was going to college for Elementary Education. I love children and it was my dream to teach. I had to jump through hoops to not be penalized for my criminal background. I continued with the teacher program. My lawyer worked out that it would be removed from my record once I finished probation. That happened this summer and I am pleased to say that my record is clean. Yet, my anxiety persists. That dehumanizing experience will stay with me forever.

This January, I had a very tough breakup with a woman (I'm bisexual) who I had been in a relationship with for 2 years following my previous abusive one. She essentially broke up with me because of my out-of-control mental illness. We don't talk, and to this day I miss her and am torn up about it. She was only my second long term relationship and the first one to treat me right. We were engaged when we broke up.

Around the same time as our breakup, I started student-teaching as the last part of my degree program. I taught a difficult class last semester and an even harder class this semester. I have SEVERE performance related anxiety, so the entire experience has been a struggle for me. Feeling like I'm not a good teacher, like they don't listen to me, and like people are constantly judging/dissatisfied with me. I feel this way even though I get good feedback. My last day student teaching is this coming Thursday. I will be graduating on December 15th with my Elementary Education degree. This should bring me some relief, but I feel like I am not at all prepared to be a real teacher because I'm a completely anxious mess when under pressure. I feel like I picked the wrong career because I can't swallow my anxiety and stand in front of a classroom. 

Additionally, a few months ago, my 2yo dog dislocated her kneecap (apparently a common problem in small breeds). She needs major orthopedic surgery to put a plate in her knee. We have had her evaluated but haven't been able to schedule the surgery because of money. We are expecting a student loan refund soon that should help cover it. My doggy is on anti-inflammatory meds and sometimes the kneecap pops back into place and she walks on it, but I feel so guilty and anxious every time I see her limping around.

Most recently giving me a whirlwind of anxiety,  my mother, my only support system, is now having her own crisis. We just got news that her mother (my grandmother) is not likely to recover well from her last heart surgery. My mom moved in to take care of her and she's losing her appetite/weight and overall strength. It's looking like the end is coming sooner than we thought. I am not as close to my grandma, because she we didn't talk for years. Of course I still love her and my mom. My mom lost her sister (my aunt) a few years ago, so this will be hard for her. I am trying to be strong for my mom, because she's always been there for me, but it's taking its toll on me. I am sad about the situation too. I feel so selfish that I can't put aside my own anxiety so that I can help her more.

My anxiety is a living hell. I can't enjoy the things I used to anymore. I can't step back and objectively judge that things are going to okay. I can't turn my mind off for 2 seconds.  Every day I wake up and am flooded with dread. It's the worst in the morning. I feel like there is no end in sight for this living nightmare. I am on an SSRI and an anxiolytic, but they don't help adequately with the anxiety and panic.

Anyway, thank you for letting me get that off my chest. I don't know what I was hoping for, but I just needed someone to listen. I feel like such a low life with so little to offer. Thanks so much for anyone who made it this far, or any kind words you can offer. I love this community so much. 

I'm off to listen to some ASMR to feel like I have some company... even though I'm so alone.",1,2018-12-01 19:07:22 EST-0500

764,I bought a skateboard,"And I’m anxious as fuck

I saw one at the store- my favorite brand, Santa Monica in pink and I thought it was awesome but it was 70 dollars and I was so anxious to buy it. My first board.

Background- I’ve been looking into skateboarding on and off for seven years now but I’ve always been scared of falling off and dying or going into a coma or just not being good, so I always tried to find away around getting a skateboard. 

But today, I realized a book of mine sold. 

So I was there at the store for 45 minutes and I couldn’t buy the board. I don’t have a steady income ( I play music on the street sometimes and sell art + I am a university student) 

I was relieved I didn’t spend the money, but I felt so bad for not getting a board. I’m almost 20 my best skating years might be down the drain already. I never even tried it. 

So I went on amazon and got a 40 dollar skateboard (Minority complete skateboard) and I was glad, but I also feel like an idiot because I KNOW how shitty cheap decks can be and I am so scared of failing to skate. I haven’t been this worried to fail since I was a little kid in the GT program at school and AHHH. 

I feel damned either way, but I needed to get this out there. Maybe, if I like it, I can get a nicer skateboard. 

I just think I should be saving money I feel awful. 

I mean, I’m not in any major shortage, but I don’t want to be I’m so scared to be without a little hoard of money. I get so anxious spending because when I was younger my parents moved around a lot and we often went without food and that shit was scary. 

I also have to buy my medication without my parents knowing because if they know they’d be so mad at me, so I pay out of pocket. 

All that being said, I am so excited I want to try to Ollie.  I also kind of want to throw up. Spending more than 30 dollars on a single purchase makes my chest cave into itself.

Thanks to two very close friends I've been able to find ways around the lack of spoons to bring myself to cook again and I wanted to try and share the simple yet tasty recipes with people who share that same feeling.

Whilst it's a LONG way in development, I plan on it being a completely free release because it's only aim is to try and help people !

In the latest blog post there is a long(ish) list of things I will be adding, but I would love to know what kinds of recipes you guys would like to see simplified yet still just as tasty ! It can be anything, (even unhealthy ones as there is ways around it!) Vegan - Vegetarian - Meat feast or mixed!

I would also like to know if you believe this could actually be helpful. I have received some good feedback from those I pitched it to (although the website is not at all as far advanced as the book, I'm still working on that!)

785,please quit trying to normalize anxiety and panic attacks,"so, i get that everyone feels anxiety. however, there is a huge population that feels it all the time and/or for no reason. that is never normal, something is *wrong* with you. 

if you just up and have panic attacks because your brain is racing so fast it cannot even keep up with itself, that is not fucking normal. especially, if you are just sitting in the middle of class with no stress.  

now, if you out in the jungle some anxiety is sure going to help and that is completely normal. but being overstressed, having anxiety with seemingly no cause, and panic attacks for the same reason is far from normal. 

i know it makes some people feel better to think it is normal, but i do not think that helps. knowing there are other people like you, sure but anxiety is very complex. i have existential anxiety and that was my trigger, i have never been able to make it go away and i never might. other people may.

tl;dr: while everyone experiences anxiety, it should not make you feel any better about yours. anxiety is normal in certain circumstances but a lot of people do not even know the root cause of their anxiety. i do not think it is wise to normalize something that signifies that something is *wrong* with your random bouts of panic.

The visits left my anxiety so high that I was obsessing about what a terrible person *I* was. That *I* must have done something wrong.  Classic abusive relationship, right? I've been looking for her approval since I was 18 years old when I met my husband.  This past week, after lots of tears and heart to heart discussions with my husband, he helped me realize that it's ok to walk away! Say that again. ITS OK TO WALK AWAY! To love someone from afar and not take part in their day today life. Deep sigh of relief.  I finally did it.  Let myself walk away.  I've spent a fair amount of time obsessing about walking away but today I'm feeling relief! Our social media connections are no longer existent either so I've left nothing to let her feed into my life with the hate, judgement and chaos. It's over.

809,IM ON THE TOP OF THE WORLD RIGHT NOW! Can’t stop giggling ! (Won over anxiety) DID I JUST DO THIS?!,"This post is really overhyped but I just get so hyped/happy when I manage to do something like this!

I first called my future boss today, (anxiety for calling him). We decided we was gonna drive to the office in the city and talk (the city is 20min away), so I asked my grandma to drive me there. That’s anxiety number 2, being seen with my grandma. I then decided I was gonna go to a store in the city and buy some stuff. This is anxiety trigger number 3. Go where it’s a lot of ppl.

We went to the office first. He said I can start next week! I even meet my little brothers friends big brother there, cause he was buying something there. The boss even showed me the workspace and his partners and I said hi and talked like I don’t have anxiety / social anxiety at all. I didn’t think “omg what do they think of me etc” Nothing like that happened!

Then we went to the store to buy cloths and some stuff, I went there I talked like normal, I answered hi when the ppl that work there said hi. I looked at them even! Then we couldn’t find my cloths really, so we asked a guy that work there. He said follow me and I went away from my grandma cause she went the other way! So now I’m alone with a stranger! I talked to him like normal, I got what I wanted then I said “thank you!” Then I calmly walked back to my grandma! Then I was gonna try my new bank card. I never used that in a store before and I had huge anxiety that it won’t work when a lot of ppl watching me. So we go to the thingy where u pay, I lay everything up and it didn’t work the first time cause I didn’t push the card all the way in. I even said “hm it doesn’t work” then he said what to do. I did it and I payed then I stood STILL LIKE SO CALMLY AND UN ANXIOUS while I was looking at my grandma paying when it was like 10 other ppl in the line.

It wasn’t a lot of ppl in that store it was no sounds really cause it was only a few ppl there, so maybe I woulda got a lot more anxious if it was more sound/ more ppl but WOW I JUST DID THIS! DIJGKWOFJSKFKDJFJD IM SO PROUD OF MYSELF!

Like how ON EARTH did I not feel any anxiety, when normally my anxiety/ social anxiety is god awful! Is it cause it’s summer or what?!

I JUST HAD TO SHARE THIS TO SOMEONE!!! HAPPY BOY. (I’m 20) so a lot of ppl probably expect me to do this without my grandma there in the first place but, I did it!! I didn’t even feel the need to be with my grandma there, like I felt quite confident even if she wouldn’t be there.

I did it!

EDIT: my grandma probably gonna tell my mom how proud they are of me etc and I gonna cringe af. But I call worth!

EDIT 2: I don’t know if I didn’t feel as much anxiety cause I woke up 9am went up and exercised, I was debating with myself for 10min if I would be to scared to exercise outside where my grandparents can see me but I did that as well! I just feel so strong atm!

810,Does anyone have anxiety waiting to go somewhere?,"I have an appointment at 2. I asked the office to please make it the earliest in the day.

When this happens, I pace around, have severe anxiety for no reason, and feel like my day is ruined. I stare at the clock and usually arrive way too early.

Does anyone else do this?",30,2018-05-21 20:11:35 EDT-0400
811,Spent two hours crying alone on a sidewalk.,"
I traveled for a few hours so I could see a show I’d been excited to see for months. It wasn’t good. 

I get panic attacks at a lot of shows, but I go anyway because I love them. And when it’s good, I get lost in the experience and it’s kind of therapeutic. I fucking love the aggressive ones where I can get my bad feelings out without genuinely hurting people.

Anyway: I had a feeling this one would give me
a panic attack, which is shitty but okay. I have them a lot, I’m good at riding them out. But this was the worst one I’ve had in a long time.

What began the spiral was the crowd. The people around me were fucking annoying. Normally the annoying people dissipate over time, but these ones were resilient. I  won’t get into what they were doing, but I don’t think it was a malicious thing. They were just self absorbed drunk people. I didn’t move because I wanted to see the show and also have an attitude of “fuck that I’m not letting these shit-eaters stop me”, but I couldn’t focus on what was actually happening so HEY I guess they did.
 
Then my personal issues started revving up, because that’s how anxiety goes for me. See how everyone here is thinner? See how they have friends? See how much less crazy they look? I felt like a disgusting alien.

It moved from feeling bad to feeling that panic attack terror when the headliner was playing, because her whole album is about abuse/rape. And the girls around me kept yelling at her about how hot she is mixed with empty shit like RAPE SUCKS. And I get that it’s not a huge
deal, but in the moment it was fucking terrifying to me, because I was having a lot bad stuff come up and I felt completely alone. Like I’d read this entire album I loved wrong, nobody got it, and I once again felt like a disgusting alien. Except now it was tied to that feeling of being rotted from the inside, my skin was crawling,
and I couldn’t breathe. I am filth to the core of my fucking soul and I will die alone in a cesspool shit.

I started having a panic attack, but I was able to stave it off until the end (sometimes I can push them off a bit when I recognize it early). Then I drank some water, went outside, and burst into tears on the sidewalk.

It’s also worth noting that I was wearing a black sweatshirt that said I HAVE GIVEN UP, was drenched in sweat, and it had rained out so everything was wet. Total fucking mess.

And that’s where I stayed for two goddamn hours. I changed spots a couple times, but I was mostly frozen in terror trying to convince myself that I was allowed to move. Of the 40+ people who walked by, only one asked if I was okay, even though I was blatantly losing my shit. 

I kind of don’t blame them because I realize there is danger in talking to people who look crazy, but at the same time I do. Because I ask people if they’re okay all the time. Especially at shows where people are on drugs.

I haven’t really slept, I cut up my arm, and I feel like vomiting. I’ll get over it, but I needed to vent. I feel humiliated, stupid, and alone.

813,Saying goodbye to my psychologist,"Hi everyone, I'm graduating university soon and that means I have to say goodbye to my university psychologist. She helped me so much. I was away from home, from my family and my anxiety was really bad (I have ocd) and she was the first person that believe in me and understood what was going on in my brain and made feel like I wasn't crazy. 3 years passed and I'm so much better, I'm a totally diferent person. In my last consult we both started crying because next consult it will be my last.
So I want to make something special, a little something to say thank you. Nothing can pay what she did to me but I want to give her something that she could keep and remember me because I will never forget her.

And then my brain starts going overtime, is someone down stairs, for context I have 3 children and i don’t know if some of it is “how am I going to react if someone is downstairs” I mean we have a huge German Shepard who barks at the slightest thing but that doesn’t stop me worrying about whether I can protect him, can I protect my wife and kids.

818,I went to the movies with a cute girl and it went great,"So I had been talking to this girl for a couple months , met her through a friend and we sort of hit it off. Id been wanting to hang out one on one but just couldn't, everytime I'd try to message her and ask I'd just shutdown and be unable. Through some miracle I managed to ask her to see Deadpool and she was keen. So last night we met up (she said I looked good which was nice) and got some food (which I could hardly eat I was so nervous) then saw the film. Throughout the entire film she was just learning on me, occasionally resting her head on my shoulder. Overall just being kinda cutesy. I was honestly quite stressed throughout the night but kind of hid it; she did comment after that I was shaking and my eye was twitching so apparently not well. But overall aside from the stress I actually had fun last night. We've already made plans to do it again sometime and I'm actually looking forward.

821,"Doing something that terrified me for two years tomorrow. Screw you, anxiety","**UPDATE! I made it!! I had two pretty bad panic attacks within the first 30 minutes of hitting the road and so I stopped both times because my hands clamped up and I was all tingly but I calmed myself down and kept moving! The trip ended up all in all taking longer than I should've but I'm so relieved that I made it and I can't believe I did it!!**

Because of my anxiety, I tend to be a homebody. Traveling (especially flying) is a nightmare for me, and I can only really manage my anxiety on trips when I'm with my parents. Otherwise, the trip is however many days of nausea, panic, and the whole lot.

But tomorrow, I'm doing something that I've always been too afraid to do. I'm taking a 3 hour road trip by myself. I know that sounds silly. I only got my license about 3 years ago when I was 16, right on time, but I was slow to take up driving. I love driving in familiar areas close to home, but hate driving distances. It's all because of my anxiety. What if I get sick? What if I pass out? What if I crash? What if I panic and get home?

Well, I don't care. And I know I can do it. I can handle it. I've changed so much just within a year and I don't want to be afraid anymore, so I'm doing this. I'll be visiting my boyfriend (we go to college together but he normally lives 3 hours away) so it's worth it. I tried doing this twice last summer and chickened out. But this time is different. 

Hoping for the best!!! The weather isn't looking the best (cloudy/rainy) and I'd much prefer sun but can't do anything to change that. 

Any road trip tip would be much appreciated :) I'm leaving tomorrow morning!",17,2018-05-20 04:28:02 EDT-0400

I submitted something in late and I was so sure my boss was going to blow up on me that I paced around for hours at home, but he called and was very understanding. It's exhausting having to live life as a panicky mess. 

I was scolded once by a strict coach when I was 15 and it took me actual years to get over it. After that one encounter, I was so scared that I would get heart palpitations and have to be physically forced to go to practice. ",115,2018-03-20 13:00:51 EDT-0400

829,Would any of you lovely people be interested in a gentle 'podcast' to ease your racing mind when you're all alone?,"I'm posting on an alt account to preserve my anonymity, but I'm a relatively prolific user here on /r/anxiety.

As a lonely person who spends a lot of time alone, I often depend on podcasts or YouTube to 'keep me company'. But with anxiety being as fickle as it is, it's hard to find something that sinks into the background without being too boring or stimulating.

Recently I've been wanting to put free time to better use and get over my fear of talking to people, so as a person who tends to ramble on a lot, I thought it might be a fun idea to post my rambles online for other people to (hopefully!) enjoy. The general idea was to record myself softly talking the listener through something I'm doing or find interesting, but in a way that doesn't matter too much if you zone out a bit. Like Bob Ross, but with less paint and hair. 

I'm really open to ideas though and if any of you folks have any ideas for specific things you would like me to talk about I'd consider doing (free!) commissions.

Please tell me I’m not alone? Is anyone else getting this feeling? Does anyone else feel this way?  :( 

I got surprised with a new car for an early graduation present from my parents. I’m extremely lucky to have even gotten it since we aren’t rich and don’t have a lot of money.. I had a job but me and my stupid stress and anxiety had to quit my first job after two whole days because I couldn’t handle it.. I wanted to keep the job so badly... I failed.. 

And today I got to buy concert tickets to some of my favorite dj’s and artists. I’ve never been to a concert before and I’m extremely excited for it. 

Anyways back to the point of this post.. 
Does anyone else get nervous and extremely anxious when good things happen? I’m scared now that something bad is going to happen or that something will go wrong..  :( I’m really scared and I don’t know why or what to do. I hate feeling like this.

EDIT: I’m so sorry I can’t reply to all of you right now. I will be replying to as many as I can! Thank you all so much! I’m just also worried that this concert I bought tickets to, will end up being 18+ even though I’ve looked everywhere trying to find out. The website does say all ages but I’m just really scared because every time someone I really like and want to see comes anywhere close to me, (I live in the middle of nowhere in south Texas. The closest Walmart is an hour away), it’s always 18+ .. 

Has anyone ever heard of Breakaway Dallas? It’s a music festival.. or here is the website as well - [Breakaway Music Festival](breakawaydallas.com) 
Can anyone help me out with this? It would be a huge relief or I’ll be stressing out until April 7th.. 

Thank you all again. You’re amazing people here.

834,"My anxiety drives me to stop participating in new hobbies, cut off newfound friendships, and isolate myself.","I’ve been dealing with this for years. For a short, one sentence reason why I’m like this- I was raised in a home where I was emotionally abused and encouraged to not try to better myself or do anything but exist.

As a result, I have a difficult time participating in any sort of activity with other people. I’ve come to fully expect to fail and be horrible at anything I do, and I feel like whatever people I meet along the way secretly hate me. This always seems to happen to me when I get really into something and get excited which is almost like a grace period, but then... it just crashes.

For instance, I just got into Dungeons and Dragons. It’s been.... a month or so? And I’m already wanting to quit after participating in four games because I feel like my character and abilities are awful and that the people I’m playing with are only doing it because they feel obligated.

I’m fully aware that a lot of this is in my head, but as much as I try to rationalize it, I always find myself cutting it off and choosing to participate in activities that only require me, myself, and I.

I don’t want to be that old person who has literally nobody in their life and nothing to live for. I want so bad to push through it, but I just.... can’t?

Can anyone give me some advice as to how to better manage myself with this? I want to better myself as a person.

Also, I have a job that requires me to be friendly, well speaking and everything, and my problems there are far less severe. I still feel like I suck at it, but I’m sure as hell great at acting in the moment.",19,2018-03-17 08:17:58 EDT-0400

If something has happened to him, I feel like its my fault. Like I was supposed to keep him safe.

 It's not a date lol, but I don't usually ask women to go out. I went out of my comfort zone to ask her, and I felt comfortable doing it. Anxiety didn't affect me at all. Here's hoping to a fun experience next month!",11,2018-03-15 07:37:46 EDT-0400

849,How I’ve managed my anxiety,"If you check my post history you would believe me, anxiety has plagued my life for the last couple years or so and I know it does and has for many people on this sub. I used to live my life with constant fear for my health the constant anxiety left me with chest pain and a constant feeling of impending doom. Then I moved from the country to the middle of a town and everything has changed for the better for me. I started going to the gym daily, playing basketball, and interacting with people more. I haven’t been on any medication and I don’t even  think about my anxiety anymore. Don’t get me wrong every once in a while it is there for minutes at a time but limiting my caffeine to the morning and making sure I eat when I drink coffee combined with the daily exercise has done wonders for me. I know this isn’t exactly new information for many of you but I want everyone to know that it can and will get better! You are stronger than your anxiety! ",15,2018-03-17 22:17:53 EDT-0400
850,"Anyone else think they come off as rude in social settings because you're too scared to talk, resulting in silence?","Sometimes I just don't know what to say when I talk to people, so I just stay silent. I know people have told me I come off snobby or rude when I don't speak to them, but sometimes I don't know what to say to them or I'm too anxious to talk. I've had people tell me they thought I hated them initially because I wouldn't talk to them. That totally was not the case. 

Does anybody else feel like this?",106,2018-01-09 19:15:28 EST-0500
851,Does anyone else have so much they have to do that they just end up doing nothing?,"I'm under a lot of stress right now with going back to school, starting a new job and being a mom of 2 at the same time. I have to hire a sitter for my daughter, which means I have to post an ad and then actually *interview* people. In person. And then tell them if I want to pay them money to watch my kids. 

My house is also just disgusting. Toys everywhere and laundry and dishes and just random shit. It's not like hoarders level and it's respectable enough but it needs a good deep cleaning. 

I have to work by myself for my first time ever tomorrow. Customer service. 

I have to figure out school loans, find a way to buy these ridiculously expensive textbooks, buy supplies for school, clean my car out, go grocery shopping, sell stuff on eBay and donate the rest of it, and try to get 8 hours of sleep because with my anxiety I've been managing about 4 and that's not cutting it anymore. 

I feel like I'm constantly about 30 seconds away from a panic attack. If I think about how much I need to do I can feel myself start to hyperventilate and my chest seizes up and my whole body feels tense and I start clenching my teeth. So the only way I can stop it is to lay down, get out my tablet and play candy crush. I actually did that for two straight hours last night after the kids went to bed without even realizing it. 

Anyway this is rambling and stuff I just needed to get it out. ",53,2018-01-10 22:54:16 EST-0500

For two years I have been absolutely terrified of getting a job. I had gotten a job that was way too fast paced for me and I had a breakdown on the second day and quit. Since then I have had panic attacks every time I came close to employment. In the meantime I had been taking classes and volunteering in a few places, while my mother supported me. Well, last week one of the volunteer places told me they wanted me to apply for a job opening they would be posting.  It's an administrative job that I can zone out and do mostly alone. Perfect for me.  I applied, and today I got the call that I got the job! And I'm only halfway terrified! I feel like I have taken a huge step. It is quite possible that I'll feel very anxious in the coming days before I start work. I just wanted to share this victory. I've faced the biggest fear I've had since spiders.

874,I know my anxiety is bad when i'm working out how to run away,"UPDATE 17/01: I just want to thank everyone for their comments. I did the thing I was really anxious about, even though I felt like every part of my body and brain was trying to stop me. I'm glad I did it, I coped pretty well. People on this sub were very encouraging and I really appreciate it. 

I'm a grown woman with a good career and I'm currently considering backing out of something I really can't back out of. I made a commitment to do something and it's making me so anxious and miserable that I'm wracking my brain for ways to avoid it. I know I won't even feel that good if I run away from it, I'll feel like a massive failure, but I still want to run away. I hate my comfort zone sometimes. 

I'm one of those high functioning anxiety sufferers. No one would have a clue all this irrational fear is churning around inside me. 

The only thing keeping me going at the moment (and not hiding away from the world) is the knowledge that in a week it'll all be over. That, and people are relying on me.",22,2018-01-14 20:15:48 EST-0500

884,Some tips for fighting anxiety,"I have really bad anxiety, particularly by the way of panic attacks. Over the past year my symptoms have gotten extraordinarily bad, but since then they have gotten a lot better, and here’s what’s changed:

1. I started eating enough. As it turns out for the past year I haven’t been eating enough, either by skipping meals or just not getting enough calories. I lost a little bit of weight, which isn’t healthy for someone as thin as me. From that I’ve found a pattern: my anxiety is most present when I haven’t eaten.

2. I started bathing. Not that I wasn’t keeping clean before, but bathing regularly can do a lot to relax the body, which can get really tense from constant anxiety. I also started stretching regularly. I feel like this has helped to resolve some physical angst that I was having (being scared of suddenly falling over or fainting, etc.).

3. I hugged my parents. This one sounds a bit weird if you don’t understand the context, but a lot of my anxiety comes from the fear of death or tragedy occurring to either one of my parents. I met with each of them individually, told them about that anxiety, they reassured me that everything will be all right, and we hugged. I immediately felt a lot sturdier after that.

4. I took some time off. Being a student, I worked hard to find and keep a job that I could work all year round. My anxiety has gotten in the way of that many times, manifesting in many sick days, but they were understanding enough when I said that I wanted two weeks off to deal with some personal issues (that’s only one day off anyways). For the entire two weeks, I did nothing but lie in bed. At first it was scary being alone with my thoughts so much, but then I realized that they were *my* thoughts, not anybody else’s. I wasn’t going to let my imagination work against me anymore and finally got back in control of my thoughts. After this I found my insomnia and nightmares had virtually disappeared.

5. I started getting back on top of things. I met with people I had blown off in the past due to my anxiety, I did things that needed to be done before they could become a bigger problem. I found how easy it is to make things work for you when you work with the world instead of procrastinating.

I hope that this leads to my anxiety totally minimizing in the future. In the meantime I hope my story helps other people on here who may be experiencing similar things.

885,"I feel like I'm getting better, i started using a new breathing technique and maybe it might help some of you.","I read an article  about anxiety and it stated that when we are under stress or feeling anxious we tend to take quick shallow breaths at the top of our lungs. This can cause hyperventilating or dizziness. The technique discribed is instead to take one deep breath through the nose and aim to fill the lowest part of your lungs up to the top almost like filling a glass with water. Take this breath in slowly, visualise the image of filling your lungs. Hold for 3 second then blow out slowly through pursed lips.

 ""By shifting your breathing rate and pattern, you can stimulate the body's parasympathetic response. This is the body's equally powerful and opposite system to the Emergency Response and is often called the relaxation response. For our purposes I will call it the Calming Response.''

889,A lady at the gym make a comment about me.,"I was at the gym just doing my own routine. Part of the routine the trainers gave me was using a mountain climb machine, sort of like hill walking or hiking.


Anyway, there are only two of these particular machines at this gym and when I finished and got off to go refill my water bottle, the lady on the machine beside me takes out her earphones to grab my attention.


She says ""Hey"" and nods for me to look up at her. I just look up in acknowledgment without saying anything. I thought she was going to ask for a favour, like maybe she dropped something.


She then says ""I've noticed you around. You look like you've lost a lot of weight. You should be really proud of yourself!"".


Not knowing what to say I just said ""Ugh....thanks? (I guess)"". Then I just walked away and continue about my business.


I have mild autism and sometimes have difficulty understanding people. I am currently seeing a specialist to help with these type of things.


In hindsight I thought ""oh sh*t, I think I handled that a bit badly"".

Yesterday I found a men's stylist with an online booking, which was perfect as it meant no calling or waiting around for a cut. Had the cut today and it was the best hair cut experience I've ever had, my hair now looks good and my confidence has skyrocketed, like everything since getting that cut has been amazing.

896,I may have discovered a way to be comfortable with anxiety,"I think I may have found the single best treatment option for me, and it is a combination of things, because I have learned that no single thing will do the trick.
The first thing is doing the worry-period exercise. This exercise is when you push off panic until your determined worry period.
The second thing is regular exercise. Feeling better about myself helps overall health, as I'm sure is easy to predict. 
The third and last thing may be the most pivotal thing: I have been reading and learning about anxiety. I just picked up Turtles All the Way Down yesterday, and it feels so good to be able to relate to another person's experience, even if they are fictitious. I plan on purchasing more books about anxiety to learn even more. I think it's beneficial to think of anxiety as a phobia to most things.  Phobias are overcome-able, and the first step is to familiarize yourself to whatever you're scared of.
I think, in like manner, becoming familiar with anxiety, not feeling like you're alone, is absolutely pivotal to beating it.",11,2018-05-27 01:50:30 EDT-0400

Today though I thought “fuck it” I’m not living my life around this fear anymore, so I popped into a small Thai restaurant near my home for lunch. I sat at my table and I ordered some food and I ate.

# Anxiety tip #1 -  Stop consuming caffeine

Caffeine increases the level of a neurotransmitter called norepinephrine in your brain. This neurotransmitter triggers your sympathetic nervous system. Stimulating your fight or flight response is the primary process of the sympathetic nervous system. 

Caffeine also makes your body release adrenaline and depletes your body of the ‘anti-stress vitamin’ B1 (thiamine). For anxious people these things add up quickly, making them feel stressed out and on edge. 

Note: The sensitivity to caffeine varies quite a bit between people. But whether you are sensitive to caffeine or not, **caffeine WILL make you feel more anxious**. It’s best to avoid caffeine as much as you can. 

&#x200B;

# Anxiety tip #2 - Set specific times in your day to be offline

People with anxiety are usually sensitive and easily overstimulated. We might have gotten used to it, but the internet is a pretty hectic place. Your subconsciousness knows that at any time it could see something on the internet that will trigger it. You won't get really deep rest and stress relief if you are always online

**It’s very important that you create time for yourself every day where you KNOW that you won’t be disturbed**. Most people don’t recover well enough from their daily stress. That’s why our stress accumulates and we end up feeling anxious and on edge more than we need too. We can make sure this stops happening by planning time into our day where we’ll be offline. We should put our phone away and go read a book, meditate, or go for a walk everyday. 

&#x200B;

# Anxiety tip #3 - Train yourself to breathe through your stomach

Scientists have recently discovered that humans have group of brain cells whose only function it is to ‘watch’ our breath. If the breath is slow, deep, and done with our stomach, it signals to the brain that everything is okay. If the breath is fast, shallow, and done with our chest, it signals to the brain that something might be off.

Breathing in your chest is meant for fight or flight situations. It’s original purpose is to get your body and your mind in a state of readiness by pumping a ton of oxygen into them. 

**Breathing through your stomach has been proven to lower stress and anxiety**. And it’s actually not that hard to retrain yourself to breath like this all the time! If you learn to breathe through your stomach, you will be decreasing your anxiety automatically, just by breathing. 

&#x200B;

# Anxiety tip #4 - Tie up loose ends

You could do this right now, and it would make a world of difference. We can feel very overwhelmed and anxious because we have so many loose ends in our life. We have mail that we haven’t opened yet, we have friends we should call, maybe our room needs a good cleaning, or you haven’t checked your bank statements in 2 months. 

These things are tricky to actually go and do. The longer we procrastinate, the more anxiety we build up around them. But biting the bullet and doing all these things will reduce your anxiety a lot. It might spike your anxiety while you’re doing it. But when it’s done you’ll feel much better and lighter. **The less we have on our mind, the less anxious we’ll feel.** 

&#x200B;

# Anxiety tip #5 - Exercise at least twice a week

Now most of us know that exercise is healthy and works well to reduce anxiety. But a lot of us don’t realise just how critical exercise is. In his ‘*Anxiety and Phobia workbook*’  E.J. Bourne says **his clients reported exercise to be the most effective thing for reducing their anxiety.** 

Exercise is a natural outlet for the body's fight or flight mode. There are many proven benefits to regular exercise. Among them are reduced insomnia, increased self-esteem, and greater sense of control over anxiety. 

Pro Tip: Exercise that targets your larger muscles, like running, swimming, and cycling, are found to be the most effective for countering anxiety

&#x200B;

# Anxiety tip #6 - Be in flow

Athletes call this state ‘being in the zone’, Psychologists refer to it as flow. It’s a state where you forget the time and whatever is going on around you. If you are in flow you are totally absorbed in what you are doing. Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi, the psychologist who came up with the concept, describes the 8 characteristics of flow as follows:

1. Complete **concentration** on the task
2. **Clarity of goals** and reward in mind and immediate feedback
3. Transformation of **time** (speeding up/slowing down of time)
4. The experience is intrinsically **rewarding**
5. **Effortlessness** and ease
6. There is a balance between **challenge and skills**
7. Actions and awareness are merged, **losing self-conscious rumination**
8. There is a feeling of **control** over the task

Flow makes you temporarily free from your anxiety in a healthy way. It makes you more calm throughout your day and gives you something to look forward too. Find something that puts you in a state of flow and make sure you do it at least once or twice a week. It will make a big difference in in your life satisfaction.

# Anxiety tip #7 - create an anxiety busting morning ritual

Most people grab their phone the second they wake up. This is about worst thing you can do to start your day. It’s very important we start our day on our own terms. We should let no influence from the outside bother us for at least the first hour of your day. Create a morning ritual for yourself that calms you and will give you the necessary strength to deal with your anxiety. 

We shouldn’t sleep on creating a morning ritual! It makes a massive difference if you start your day right. 

Those are my 7 tips for reducing your anxiety right now, so you can be more peaceful and more successful in your relationships, job, and your life.

I have no doubt in my mind that you are capable of defeating your anxiety. You are absolutely able to do it.

906,#metoo,"I am having a very hard time this week with my anxiety because I feel inundated by the news related to Kavanaugh/Ford allegations. 

In May of 1986, I, too, was gang raped at a high school party by boys that I knew, while I was intoxicated.  I am not going to share the details of the attack,  I am willing to say that I was hospitalized afterwards with significant injuries and I was unable to attend  my high school graduation because I was in the hospital.  Although I am pretty sure that my parents knew my injuries weren’t from “falling down in the woods” and the medical practitioners that examined me were very much aware that I didn’t just fall down.. no one addressed the true nature or extent of it.. even me.

I never talked about it. I never wanted to. I never wanted “justice.”  I wanted to make it go away because for a long, long time I felt like it was my fault. 

After 32 years.. it’s right there.. all over again.

I want to scream at every Facebook poster that has something obnoxious to say about Ford not coming forward.  I want to punch everyone who says “well, she was drunk” or “Boys will be boys.”  I want to vomit every time someone says “why did she wait so long?” and worse.. “he didn’t do anything..he just didn’t help her.” 

I feel like this happened to me last week, not over 30 years ago.  It doesn’t seem fair after successfully tucking it away for so long  it has resurfaced. 

I can see their faces in my dreams again. Even the ones who laughed at my torn bloody clothing and didn’t to anything to help, 

Edit: I adore all of you!! I focused on all of your support and wonderful well wishes.. not on the news!! Thank you, thank you, thank you! ",71,2018-09-27 13:38:12 EDT-0400

Does anyone else always go through this whenever they go out?",44,2018-09-23 03:56:30 EDT-0400
908,I DROVE TODAY - big win!!,"I just wanted to share with someone my big victory of the day (month and even year). It's been 5 years since I drove a car, because I was terrified of doing it. (Btw, I have generalized anxiety disorder so it was feeding my fear) I have done and passed my driver's license 5 years ago but after that, didn't drive since then. Today, I was tired of not being able to be independent because I can't make myself drive. I told my SO that I wanted to drive in a really quiet neighborhood near our home. He drove there and after I took the driver's place. I was so scared. I thought i was going to crash or make an accident. I did it anyway. My SO was patient and gave me tips. I parked. He then asked me if I was up to the task of drive back home. To do so I had to go on a main road and a boulevard with a bunch of cars, poeple and construction. I hesitated but said ""fuck it"" and did it. I did it guys. I was scared and nervous all the way home. But I DID IT. I'm proud of myself and I'm even a little excited (and scared) to do it again. 

Best luck for everyone out there.

***EDIT***

Wow! I wanted to thank you all for the amazing support I've been receiving on this post. You're all REALLY sweet to have taken the time to write replies filled with hope, joy and encouragement. If anyone is curious, I drove again today because I didn't want to take the chance of letting anxiety get the best of me again if I would've waited to go back. I was less nervous and did even more different maneuvers (not the freeway though. Not  YET). 

For the people wondering what I did do make myself drive again. I know it will sound really simple but after 5 years of putting off, I had this impulse of juste doing it. Not because I wanted it but because I was tired of not being able to go where I wanted to go or applying to jobs I wanted because I couldn't drive. I had this impulse and knew that if I let myself think to much I would have hesitated. I would have convinced myself of not going. I didn't think. I just said to my SO, OK! WE ARE GOING! Haha. He was a little confused but proud. 

To ease my anxiety, I wanted to start small with some tasks I was less anxious about (driving in a calm neighborhood). That made me feel a little less anxious and even create a positive feeling that I could associate with driving. Because I started small, I was able to perceive a little bit of competence. 

Also, I was anxious of going back driving again. But again, on an impulse that I listened, I went driving again today. A little bit like exposure therapy (as a lot of you in the comments said : practice reduce anxiety!)

I really hope for all of you who struggle (as I am still) to be compassionate towards yourself. Even if you're not there yet, be patient with yourself and when you're ready you'll push yourself a little bit. Baby steps people <3",66,2018-09-23 04:48:50 EDT-0400

911,"Anxiety isn’t just chest pains, crying, and the inability to relax."," 

Anxiety isn’t just chest pains, crying, and the inability to relax.

It’s biting your nails until they bleed, then picking off the skin on your fingers once you’re out of nails to bite.

It’s driving to the store only to sit in the parking lot for 20 minutes before turning back around, without even going inside.

It’s getting a text message and forgetting to respond promptly, so instead of responding explaining you were busy, you leave the notification there for days, weeks, even months, getting a knot in your stomach every time you scroll past it or every time that person’s name comes up.

It’s hearing a noise and planning in your mind where you’ll hide, what doors you’ll lock, and how you’ll secretly call for help if someone broke into your house.

It’s asking your partner several times a day if they love you, partially kidding, but mostly needing to hear it because you find it so hard to love yourself in that moment.

It’s putting off washing the dishes until there’s no dishes left, but then feeling overwhelmed by how many dishes there are to wash, so you just leave them another day.

It’s understanding that what you’re worrying about is often irrational and not as extreme as your reaction warrants, but not being able to control your response. Often times, it even means you CAN’T understand that what you’re worrying about is irrational or not as extreme as your reaction warrants.

Anxiety isn’t just chest pains, crying, and the inability to relax. It’s taking everyday parts of life and intensifying the excitement or fear they result in times a thousand, to the point that they seem impossible to face. Some days are more manageable than others, and it’s on those days I try to remind myself that I CAN get through whatever anxiety throws my way.

It’s hard for me to share this, but if even one person finds comfort in knowing they’re not alone in this.",56,2018-09-25 18:18:17 EDT-0400
912,"I know how weird this is, but does anyone else get really anxious if the lighting ""feels"" wrong?","I recently changed the light bulb in the lamp that is the main source of light in my living area and notice that it's slight more yellow/orange and less white than the old light bulb and it makes me so uncomfortable. I had to move things around and certain light combinations have to be on for it to ""feel"" right. For example: moved the lamp to a different spot where it can provide light to more parts of the room and also have to have dining room light on as well. I can't explain it, but I guess it just makes me feel really uneasy. ",111,2018-09-26 07:26:56 EDT-0400

918,Therapist charged me a $125 cancellation fee because I missed my appointment to go see my dying grandma,"I’ve been seeing my current therapist for about one year and liked her pretty well. Last Wednesday evening I got a call that my grandma who lives 600 miles away was being placed on hospice care. I messaged my therapist that I couldn’t make it to my appointment the following day because I was going to drive out and see my grandma because she is expected to pass away soon. My therapist responded “Sorry to hear that. You will be charged a $125 for late cancellation. You can send a check or pay at your next appointment in cash.”

This really upset me because it is the only time I’ve ever canceled late (less than 24 hours before the appointment). I can afford to pay it, but she knows how worried I’ve been about my grandma and this just seems uncaring to me. 

On Friday she messaged me “I sent you a bill. Please let me know when you receive it.” This upset me even more and I responded “okay, please cancel all my future appointments.” She messaged back, “Why?” and then I blocked her number.

But anxiety is the predominant feeling wrt all this, so I could only think to post here.

I \[27\] am very unphotogenic and have developed a fear of being photographed. These things probably feed into each other. But it's to the point where I think it's disrupting my life, because I've started expending fairly significant amounts of energy avoiding cameras and even sometimes going so far as to avoid events where there's a pretty good chance there will be a camera pointed in my direction. I'm very body dysmorphic and cameras/photographs of myself have been a source of anxiety for years, but it's getting worse; I won't even take selfies anymore out of fear that I'll feel like garbage for the rest of the day, and when I'm pulled into photographs with friends or family, I look away or try to find a way to obstruct my face.

I really want to repair my relationship with cameras because you know, I'd like to get engagement photos and wedding day photos without losing my mind, and besides all that in this age everyone has a camera at their disposal and is trigger-happy with it. I need to be able to accept that and stop hiding and running away. I just don't know how. ",9,2018-09-23 15:47:19 EDT-0400

A mouth guard won't really help because I actually don't do it when I am sleeping. It is about the only relief I really get from the soreness.

924,Bad Anxiety over posting on Reddit.,"So, in the last few years I've pretty much stopped posting on Reddit. Any time I post a question, or a concern, it gets downvoted to all hell to the point my posts are 0 and all my comments are mostly negative, so I have an anxiety attack and delete the post. I just now did that again. Someone cheated in a game I play, and I posted about it to get some input (no names or witch hunting). My comments thanking people for the information were even downvoted, all I was doing was being polite!  
I just feel like a social failure. All I want to do is have discussions with people, or ask questions about games or life, and I have to end up deleting it because of all the downvoting and name calling. I just feel utterly defeated.  
All I want is to be listened to. So what if people disagree with me? Does that mean you have to harass me, and go out of your way to downvote me and my comments so they aren't seen? Does me being sad really make you all so happy?  
I'm sorry for venting, but this is why I stopped even going on reddit for a long time. I come back for one simple thing, and it happens again. I get it, there will always be negativity, and I need to get over it. But really? Does there always have to be so much? Can't I for just once in my life have an opinion? I just want to express myself.. is that so much to ask?",21,2018-09-24 05:16:30 EDT-0400
925,Do you think it's possible to have been born with anxiety?,"My anxiety pretty much fully came to me when I was 13 years old due to a traumatic event. I’m 21 now btw. 

But looking back on it I was always such a worrier when I was a kid in primary school. The  tiniest issues would cause me great stress and I remember having stomach aches and never being able to sleep the night before school out of worry. ( oddly they were very tiny issues but I guess to kid they’re massive). Makes me wonder if I was going to end up with anxiety traumatic event or not. Also it makes me sad that majority of my childhood was riddled with worrying . Sigh. 

I wonder how common it is to be a ""worrier kid"".

934,Don't know how to deal with this,"So I'm happily married, with two lovely (if rather boisterous at times) daughters - home life in the main is good, if rather chaotic !

But when I was in my teens, there was a girl in my class at school I was utterly besotted with. She would never have gone out with me because I was the dorky, awkward-but-nice kid at school with terrible hair. But for 3-4 years I was utterly, madly in love with her in the way teenagers are: I loved it when we were in the same class for certain subjects; we were both in the school orchestra so I could see her then; she lived near me and re-worked my paper round route to go past her house. (This was in the mid-90s.)

Nothing ever came of it and I did get over it... sort of. I moved away ten years ago from the city we both lived in, but we hadn't really seen each other properly in about 10 years anyway, at a school reunion, where any ill-effects from my teen obsession weren't a problem. She's also now happily married with two children.

But I say ""sort of"" because every now then she turns up in a dream of mine. Not often in a romantic way, often just as friends. But when that happens, it brings back up all the memories of those times when I was mad for her; I notice her Facebook posts more, I end up thinking about her a lot. Whenever I go back to the city where we grew up, part of me hopes to see her again. And this becomes anxiety-related, I think, because then I start feeling guilt that I'm being unfaithful to my wife, feeling like a creep for still having in my mind in this way someone from the best part of 25 years ago - none of which is at all helpful. I don't like it happening, but don't know how to make it stop.

I've not told anyone this, not my wife nor anyone apart from this thread. But it's crazy and I just want some kind of closure, just for my mind to realise that that part of my life is over, we're both happily married, just to find someway to put a full stop on her. 

Can anyone offer any advice? ",0,2018-12-16 12:57:14 EST-0500

So yesterday my friends and I went out and I got terribly drunk, way more than ever. Today, when I woke up, I was extremely confused as I didn't remember ever getting home. My mom, who hadn't even seen me tipsy before, had to explain me that my friends basically dragged me home and I ended up puking all over my pillow (I don't remember any of it). My mom has been super nice about it, telling me it had happened to her before, laughing at me and telling me to be careful next time. But despite her having been so nice and acting as if nothing had happened, I can't stop feeling this terrible shame and guilt. I have spent the entire day with a constant knot in my chest and a desire to cry, and I need it to stop. I am very prone to having anxiety and depressive episodes and today isn't helping.

I have learnt the lesson and I won't ever do it again as it was completely unnecessary. Can any of you give me any tips on how to stop these feelings?",2,2018-12-16 06:30:46 EST-0500

941,Are these symptoms of a panic attack? What should I do?,"I’m pretty sure I had a panic attack today again my second one within 3 months. It all started with me complaining to my mom about my anxiety and she keeps saying I’m an hypochondriac and she didn’t want to hear me complain anymore Got really mad and  threatened to call an ambulance on me and I went into panic mode telling her not to call I was too scared to go to the hospital in an ambulance to just stop I’ll try and calm down on my own at home. It was so bad I started crying I couldn’t take it anymore and couldn’t stop for like 30 minutes or more and I kept pacing back and forth around my house. Now like an hour later I started getting this weird feeling like I was going to pass out and I felt like I didn’t know where I was for a few minutes. I guess derealization feeling or an ocular (eye) migraine I don’t know. Also I’m tremoring really bad internally my neck, chest stomach, back, arms and legs basically everywhere. I also have head pressure (probably from working myself up from being in such a panic?) and just a few minutes ago my whole cheeks went numb along with my right hand for like 5 minutes I swore something was going to happen. I lied in bed tried to do some breathing techniques and it’s helping a little bit my tremors are still going full blast and it’s bothering me. What should I do? I don’t want to go to the er anymore I’ve already been 6x since three months ago unless I try a different er? Or is there a way I can stop my panic at home. I can’t deal with this anymore I feel so bad but I have to get it to stop I have somewhere to be tonight and I can’t miss it and make a fool of myself for not going. Do you think even if I went after the er could help me or should I just ride out this panic attack and wait till tomorrow and see what I feel like?",6,2018-12-15 00:16:05 EST-0500

944,What do you guys eat after a panic attack?,"Long story short:, today I fucked up and drank coffee on an empty stomach which, I think, triggered a panic attack. Whole body went numb, pounding heart, yadda yadda.

I have no problem dealing with the attack itself, but the aftermath is what always gets me. 
I can't fucking eat for the rest of the day. I'm hungry as hell, but even thinking about food is making me want to throw up.

So my question is, what do you guys eat, if you can't eat? Or are there tricks for avoiding the annoying feeling?

I started having anxiety/ panic attacks this summer, so (as dumb as it sounds) I'm relatively new to this shit.

945,Does anyone feel like coffee actually helps their anxiety instead of making it worse?,"I had a panic attack yesterday over a bad argument and it was my second ever that brought me into a huge disaster. I felt like I was shaking profusely with internal tremors and I was going to pass out my face got numb along with one of my hands and I felt like a weird feeling again like I did the first time I guess it was derealization (still feeling a bit of it today or maybe just groggy I don’t know just feels like soemthing is off in my head)? I also felt like I couldn’t stop pacing around the house and I was crying so bad I couldn’t stop it made my breathing super heavy causing tension in my chest. Last night I forgot to take my nightly Valium (probably a big mistake 😬). Been on Valium for about two months taking it morning afternoon and night since cutting down to hopefully come off I’ve been having problems like muscle tension in my shoulders,chest, neck and throat. (Went to the er wasn’t heart related dr said probably from coming off the Valium too quickly) anyways today I woke up still feeling off from yesterday or either from forgetting my night dose of meds and I took my morning Valium dose 2.5mg didn’t really do much yet since taking it two hours ago. So since my first panic attack about three months ago I completely cutout sugar, carbs and especially coffee cold turkey because I had a health anxiety scare. I tried some coffee again for the first time since today just black vanilla flavored Starbucks k cup with a splash of creamer and it seemed to help some now I don’t feel 100% like I felt before yesterday’s attack but I do feel a little better than I did before it when I first woke up.

946,Just need someplace to commiserate,"39/m here, have always had some low level anxiety and depression but never enough for doctors to recommend medication. Occasional therapy has usually been fine, but this year has been a shit show and I can’t seem to get it under control the last month. Mom in hospital on and off for organ transplant that has failed and needs retransplanted, mid life crisis thoughts of death, partner was hospitalized for self harm, and I was her person to lean on and I feel like that took a lot out of me, feelings of not being enough for my relationships, not feeling wanted, chest is always tight, waking up at 4 in the morning due to bad dreams or racing thoughts. I go between telling myself this is okay, this is anxiety and wanting to get and my car and drive away from it all or lock myself in the bathroom and cry. Going to the gym and wearing myself out. Self medicating with thc/cbd until I just pass out and my brain turns off. I know the answer is probably medication I just need to get myself to that point to accept it.

959,"How is diet, magnesium, and vitamins deficiency not talked about enough when it comes to managing anxiety?","I know this is long and I don't know if a lot of people will read this but I really just want to help. I had 2 panic attacks over the end of February and first day of March. I went to the doctor and had my blood work done, ekg, everything and they said I'm perfectly healthy. I workout 6 times a week. I had nothing to panic about! After that day, I started developing Harm OCD/intrusive thoughts about the recent news events that's been going on. It made me miserable, hopeless, and sometimes I would feel like ""what's the point?"" I wasn't depressed but I felt derealization. And then I went on to do CBT on my own (there are instructions online how to do CBT), went to a therapist, and I realized I felt better but I would still get anxiety attacks. My anxiety kept jumping off to something else after solving one problem. So I kept searching for a cure which led me to learn more about diet, magnesium, and vitamins.

MAGNESIUM - 70% of Americans are Magnesium deficient and I deprived myself even more when I was trying to lose weight. I started taking Magnesium (Magnesium Citrate is better, I just started those yesterday) and it made me stop stressing about unnecessary things and obsessing about negative thoughts! I slept better at night and my body stopped twitching A LOT. I stopped getting anxiety attacks throughout the day and would only get them maybe 30 mins each day now but I'd move on. I suggest taking 250 mg a day. Check the Magnesium deficiency symptoms cause this may solve your problems.

DIET - Your body needs a minimum amount of Carbs, Fats, and Protein to function. All this plays a role in your mood. These macronutrients are also important in developing serotonin and transferring them to your brain. Serotonin can be developed naturally, as long as you  track your diet. I suggest the ""myfitnesspal"" app. Track the amount of grams of protein, carbs, and fat that you are taking daily. AT LEAST meet the minimum. Your brain needs this to function properly! 

VITAMINS - so many of us are deprived of important vitamins. Take multivitamins and Fish Oil. The Fish Oil with Omega 3 have helped reduce my irritation and I feel less mood swings! There have been less instances where I felt derealization and not motivated. I started taking all these supplements and tracking my diet Sunday and I haven't felt it since! I used to feel it every day. 

I still get anxiety attacks here and there but it's gone down to like 10%. It was at 60% a week ago. And I heard from people that it never came back even years after as long as they made sure they ate healthy, exercised, and made sure to take time off from stress. It also takes your body a long time to get your deficiencies back up to normal level and will most likely take around 3 months. So be patient. For people who has had anxiety or depression their whole life, it may be that your body just isn't as efficient when it comes to absorbing these nutrients. I know this isn't the cure for everybody but I hope this can help others. There's ton of videos and articles about this online. Friends who had anxiety were real life examples for me as they got out of it. I just don't want anyone to go through anxiety, it sucks and feels like hell. If I can help even 1 person feel better, it'd make me really happy. 

Doctors don't even ask us about our diet. Neither do most therapists. That's because they don't know about Nutrition. They don't study wellness. This was an explanation by a doctor from UCLA (forgot his name) as to why we never get blood work done for our nutrients. Doctors study medicine so that's what they prescribe. CBT helped a lot for me and I think it has to be a mix of all THERAPY, EXERCISE, HEALTHY DIET, and REMEMBERING TO TAKE TIME OFF STRESS that can help you manage anxiety. Man this is long af lol, shoutout if you read this whole thing.

EDIT: I also wanna give my dog, friends, family, and coworkers a shoutout. Surrounding yourself with kind, supportive people goes a long way. People that won't think you're crazy. People that are patient and won't judge you. If you got negative/bad influence people in your life, get yourself away from them. They just make things worse. Good luck to everyone on here. Everyone is dealing with something but we'll pull through! Also if you need someone to talk to or need advice or idk whatever, just message me. I'll do my best to help you get through.

965,I Just Told Someone I Have Social Anxiety!,"Long time lurker, first time poster. This is a huge step for me, and I just really wanted to talk about it with people who also understand. 

Last Wednesday, my therapist set me a challenge - to tell one of my friends that I have social anxiety. I tend to think of my own mental illnesses as a shameful thing, something to hide from the rest of the world, whist I encourage other people who suffer from mental illnesses to share their experiences. She challenged me to tell someone I trust about my social anxiety, to relieve that burden (so to speak). 

She also challenged me to try and make a new friend - to talk to people I haven't spoken with before. 

Well, I did both this week!! I talked to someone in my class that I'd not spoken to before, and turns out, he's really friendly and very nice to me - even when I feel like I'm being awkward, or not-so-comfortable in my social interacitons. So, I (about 5 minutes ago) just told him that I have social anxiety, after I admitted it's hard for me to have face-to-face interactions and he responded with something along the lines of ""I understand, and I'd like to make it easier for you"". 

I just don't have anyone else to say this to, but this is such a massive jump in my progress. I've cried for about 10 minutes now over my anxiety and how accepting my new friend has been - I'm just so happy over this! I never in my life, thought that I would be able to do something like this. But I did it!!

Things are finally, finally looking up for me. I know I still have such an intense fear of social interaction, but just knowing that I have at least one person who's willing to speak to me regardless of my fears, just gives me hope that things will one day get better.",30,2018-04-08 18:52:19 EDT-0400

969,How I avoid morning anxiety,"Morning anxiety used to cripple and sabotage my life so. I'm sure many here relate. Here's a few small things that made a major, major difference in my morning demeanor and overall anxiety levels. ( Feeling good in the morning usually bleeds into the rest of the day )

* Sleep, and get enough of it. ( Easier said than done, but a good nights rest is a natural Xanax. No lie )

* Don't wake up thirty minutes before you have to leave. I used to do this all the time and it really fucks up your entire day. Honestly try to give yourself an hour and a half to two hours in the morning so harsh feelings of panic have time to fade out. Sit on the couch, watch YouTube, brew coffee, chill. Makes a major difference.

* Eat. I know most of us can't even fathom consuming something in the morning, but it will give your brain life and nutrition it desperately needs to pull out of anxiety mode quickly. Greek yogurt is my go to in the morning since I have an upset stomach usually, makes me feel better mentally and physically. 

* Avoid worrying about the day. I know, way easier said than done. I realized one day that if you're always panicking about what could happen, you're constantly living in fear and enter a vicious cycle. Realize that shit happens, you're only human. A mistake at the office is nothing more than a mistake and you shouldn't view it as a ""My boss hates me"" situation. There are always going to be problems and mistakes, that's life. Don't let your brain play up fuck ups into something more than what they are. We all make them, nobody is perfect even if they seem to be.

* The book ""The Subtle Art of Not Giving a Fuck"" is an absolute life changer and if you're anxiety is ruining you, you should read it. No lie. Nothing makes me feel better in the morning than this book and coffee.

I'm not coming in here to say small things will fix your problem, but they make a huge difference in your mental outlook for the day. Take care of yourself.",28,2018-04-10 16:26:36 EDT-0400

Wasn't able to perform properly so my erection kept fluctuating between semi hard and fully hard.

In 10 years, I have been through almost as many therapists, medications, and episodes. It is hard sometimes (especially now) to maintain faith that it will go away. But maybe we have to learn to live with it like an auto-immune disease or allergy, where we have to be mindful of the medications and precautions we must be consistent about.

​

One of my hardest and most successful battles with anxiety took place my Sophomore through Junior year of college. I was at a low coming back to school, with a failing long-distance relationship, difficulty finding the right combination of medicines, no clue what I wanted to do with my life, poor grades, low-self esteem, and a general belief that I would never have to grow up. After my overly co-dependent relationship ended, which I would soon learn I had been using as a crutch for my anxiety, I started a 5-week outpatient program. That program allowed me to have some balance in my life, if only temporarily, but the time it helped me pass was crucial. It allowed my meds to settle in (I believe sertraline at this time), helped me meet new people, remind me what I was truly capable of and help me focus in school. Junior and Senior years ended up being the best I ever had. I had great internships, was meeting people, and staying positive. Most importantly, my anxiety was still there, but it was as manageable as taking vitamins. I felt like myself and for once I was doing ***ME***\*.\* It led me to my next girlfriend, reaching my goals, and being truly happy.

​

Unfortunately, I soon learned a new lesson about myself and change - when I get comfortable, I forget that change is imminent. So today I am back in a similar place, perhaps even worse, to where I was starting college. I am starting a new outpatient program soon, because I again became too co-dependent on a girl and forgot that change was coming. The worst part was it cost me the girl of my dreams. Now more than ever, I know I **NEED** to learn to love and believe in myself.

​

Even though I have all but given up, I have learned that taking care of  and prioritizing ourselves may be the best cure to anxiety and depression. Every set back we have is an opportunity to learn but we must always be working towards loving ourselves over everyone else. I encourage you all to do the same, and share your triumphs, whether temporary or permanent, with this community and anyone else who needs it.

994,For those of you new to anxiety... a list!," 1. You’re not going to die. Anxiety is happy to tell you otherwise but in fact, you’re not going to die.  

2. Running from and distracting yourself from the physical and mental symptoms of anxiety is a potent fuel to keep it coming. Run towards it to destroy the illusion of danger. Welcome your symptoms. By doing so, you gain back the power. 

3. During an attack, you are as safe alone in middle of a forest as you are in the emergency room. 

4. Your body wants what is best for you. Anxiety is a “false-flag” reaction to danger and all of it’s symptoms are simply getting you ready to SURVIVE! 

5. You might hate this one but... Run. Jog. Speed walk. Get your heart-rate up for at least 30 minutes a day. You not only release powerful endorphins but you become positively familiar with a stimulated body. 

6. You are not alone! Millions of people suffer from anxiety. Your symptoms might feel unique but they are not. Let this sink in and allow it to open you up to the possibility of finding groups, subreddits and more that let you relate to other people’s stories.  

7. Go on medication if needed but don’t think it’s a cure-all. Anxiety does not have to be a life-long battle. It is completely possible to return to a life before anxiety through hard work and dedication.

8. Meditation SUCKS! Just sitting there with your thoughts?? Sounds like an impending attack to me. But if you’re serious about getting over anxiety... find a simple meditation that fits your schedule. It is in the top 3 activities you can do to quell your anxiety in my opinion. 

&#x200B;

Getting a new perspective on anxiety is huge. It's all about reframing your symptoms. Check out self-help books on anxiety and panic!

1004,The constant anxiety of past actions is fucking unbearable.,"I’ve been so cringy and awkward to so many people it’s hard to keep count. Everywhere I go now I feel like I’m the weird one because of all the awkward stuff people have seen me do before. 

Every. Single. Fucking. Day there’s always something I’ve done to cringe about. Most people have one moment in their life that makes them cringe, but I have them about once a week, and they paralyse me with just sheer embarrassment and sadness. 

I know I’m not overreacting, because if I was someone else and witnessed the awkward shit I was doing, I’d think I was a fucking weirdo too. Man I just hate myself so much. I’m unbelievably far from the person I want to be it’s almost unbearable. Everyday I see confident people, it’s unbearable knowing that I’m not one of them.

The realisation that you’re not the person you want to be is the hardest thing that can happen to someone. 

I’m completely stuck. I need help.

1006,"Sometimes the problem isn't too much anxiety, but too little drive to push through that anxiety and do things anyways","Remembering recent behaviour when I was doing good, it seems there were times when I still felt the same anxiety that was stopping me before, but did things anyways. I was somehow stronger and the anxiety was at most a mild annoyance.

Some people simply say the solution to anxiety is to go through it and do things anyways. This made me feel bad and guilty for not doing things. But there was really some other issue there, a lack of the strength needed to push through the anxiety. I also feel a kind of anger about people saying that and apparently judging me for not doing things which I simply couldn't do.

The worst anxiety experience is struggling to do something when I don't have the strength to do it, and experiencing prolonged anxiety because of that. I'm pretty sure it's better to not even try or to give up quickly than to persevere at this, because if I'm not strong enough to do it I'll just spend time in a painful state and make myself feel worse. I think if unsuccessful, such prolonged experiences also reinforce anxiety and bad habits.

But, where does this strength to push through anxiety come from?  I only have glimpses of understanding, and it's late, so I'm not going to try to put them down here now. Maybe I'll respond in a comment tomorrow.",45,2018-03-27 10:38:57 EDT-0400

1008,When you realize that your happiness matters more than money...,"I am in a very toxic work environment right now and I have been for awhile. I have been job searching since September with no luck. My job has been getting increasingly worse. 

I volunteer at an animal rescue shelter to socialize with cats since I can't have a cat of my own for awhile and after losing my cat three year ago to leukemia, it's been harder to manage my stress and depression and anxiety. Volunteering has been helping. A job opened up there to become an adoption counselor. It all sounds great, and it's five minutes from my house. 

The only downside is the pay. But I don't even care. The pay is barely above minimum wage and it would be a $7/hr pay cut from what I make now. But I'm willing to give up all of that extra money for some more happiness. And hey, it's a foot in the door, so it could potentially lead to some higher paying roles in the future. 

I have to call the guy back later as he called right as my supervisor walked in so I couldn't talk. But I hope it leads to an interview and then finally, a job offer. ",54,2018-03-23 01:42:23 EDT-0400

I was embarrassed for a few minutes but it passed eventually. Sitting here the next day, I can't believe I did that but I'm proud of myself. Just had to tell someone! Thanks guys.

Edit: Just to add what was going through my mind at the time. My psychologist has really been getting me to expose myself to uncomfortable situations especially when you know they're going to be uncomfortable. I kind of figured she had a boyfriend/didn't date customers or whatever but I considered this an experiment in allowing myself to become uncomfortable, and just sitting with that feeling for a while. It's this kind of stuff that almost literally rewires your brain (albeit small amounts over time). If you keep avoiding things, your brain will get used to it and that's how you end up using avoidance to deal with being uncomfortable. If you expose yourself to those uncomfortable situations and allow them to run their course, those feelings start to become a lot less scary over time which can help build confidence. I'm no Psychologist so that was probably a C+ at best explanation but hopefully it makes some sense.

Edit 2: Holy Moley the amount of encouragement and props is insane. You all are awesome. Thank you.",86,2018-08-14 00:15:05 EDT-0400

just think fast and realize that all those without problems we are dealing with could have possibly commited suicide in the very first weeks wearing our shoes. i assume most of them wouldn't even be able to cope for one single week. i'm not bragging whatsoever, but i assume all those without anxiety problems wouldn't survive as long as me.

I don't have $700 for an ambulance since I don't have health insurance if I'm not having a heart attack or stroke so I sent them away.

So naturally I freak out and scream at my husband and tell him to get them back. These poor men wasting their time on my anxious ass, they basically help me down to me car with my dorky husband who I love following behind, put me in my car, and then my husband drives to the hospital.

I get checked in, and then wait, then get triaged and the nurse does an EKG, then I go back out to the waiting room again. Clearly I should take this as a sign that I'm probably fine otherwise they would have taken me back right away. I'm not one to ever have an attitude with someone directly, so I wait patiently holding my heart thinking that if I'm gonna have a heart attack this is probably the best place to have one but slightly annoyed because I'm definitely sure that I'm probably dying at this point so patience wasn't my virtue lol. So they finally take me to a room. The doctor and his nurse come in and I tell him what's wrong. I tell him the only health problem I have is anxiety and he says that my problem is probably an anxiety attack, but he was a good guy and ordered a chest X-Ray just to make sure and gave me some ibuprofen and Motrin in case of any inflammation. So I get the X-ray and wait for 20 mins, holding my husband's hand while I'm laying in what I assume is now my death bed thinking of all the things I could have done with my life and how my husband is going to survive without me. I'm crying obviously, and thinking about what I'm going to write here in my last days of life that could hopefully inspire others to not waste their youth like I had.

LOL.

Finally the doctor comes back in and before he even says anything my first question is ""am I dying?"" And he shakes his head. And then I ask ""is anything wrong with me or is this just anxiety?"" And he tells me nothing is wrong and it's probably an anxiety attack. And at this point like half of my anxiety just leaves because I'm not dying anymore, but I am honestly bewildered that anxiety could do this to me. Really anxiety? You had to make me think I was having a damn stroke at 26? And he gives me some reccomendations and I politely nod and thank him. He asks me if I want to take some anxiety medicine and I nod and say yes please. So the nurse comes to give me a valium and take my vitals again. Then the registration lady tells me my balance of $354 and Honestly? It was a relief, because my dramatic ass thought I was gonna have to pay $1,000 or something. 

And after all of this, I'm angry at anxiety. What if one day I actually have a heart attack but dismiss it because I think it's anxiety and then just die? Yet at the same time, this taught me a lesson: GO GET MEDICATION! I am not super woman, I can't just fight off anxiety with my sheer will power like I'm the incredible frickin hulk, I need to literally go see my psychiatrist and humble my ass and ask for a damn benzo. I hope me going to the hospital will make him take this thing seriously enough to give me a decent dose instead of giving me a damn vitamin ass dose of klonopin once a day and wasting my time. 

If you read this all the way through, thank you. Take your meds, okay? Don't be like me and wait until you have a mock heart attack to take anxiety seriously. ",18,2018-10-12 17:41:35 EDT-0400

It's a lot different than anything I've done before with lots of group therapy. They changed my medications around Friday and added Celexa in with my Effexor.

1052,How can I tell when/if I’m having an anxiety attack?,"Hello everyone. I constantly suffer from anxiety but some days are better than others. Some days are very bad though. 

Recently I had a bad day and had troubles breathing. I just felt as if my chest was very right and I had to inhale very deeply in order to feel like I was even getting air in my system. It came out of nowhere and then quickly after my heart rate went up. I could feel it beating faster. It stayed that way for a while. I have no idea why. When this happens, I began to feel anxious and things just worsen. I just feel on edge. 
This happens frequently though. The weird chest feeling and heart rate combo. 

Anyway, this particular moment I started feeling like I was gonna cry. I could feel tears welling up but I didn’t know why it was happening or what I was crying about. My friend was with me and when she asked what I was upset about I truly had no idea. It just came over me. I stepped away to cry bc it was a very overwhelming feeling. 

My friend said she thought it might be an anxiety attack. I was always under the impression that anxiety attacks were more serious and the times I’ve heard about them, people mentioned feeling like they were gonna pass out. 

I guess I just never thought those feelings were serious enough to be considered an anxiety attack. I’m still unsure. How can I know when I have an anxiety attack? Does anyone else get those feelings? 
Thanks in advance for any answers/explanations/advice!

1057,Please help,"I’m new to reddit and was told this place might be able to help me. A little background about me, most of the time I’m a normal functioning human being and can interact with strangers with ease. When I get to my workplace, it is a completely different story and I’m hit with almost crippling social anxiety. I can generally interact with those I work closely with without issue, however, when it comes to attending meetings or having to be put on the spot in any way shape or form, I buckle like a fucking twig. The worst part is the visible signs, my face will immediately change colors to red and purple in blotchy sections on my face and neck. This amplifies my anxiety and I have trouble speaking or getting across a coherent thought. It is honestly devestating and at the age of 33, am disappointed in myself that I haven’t overcome this issue. 

At this point in my life, I feel like I will be unable to really succeed in the business world until I can learn to manage my anxiety and be able to contribute in meetings and presentations. I’m currently getting my MBA and know that I will have to do presentations eventually to graduate. I have tried beta blockers without success and would really like to avoid having to take a stronger medication. Does anyone have any advice on supplements or hippie oils that might help?

1058,Litany against fear,"Ok this might sound so weird, but I have something that has made me RIP FEAR and anxiety a new one, and calm me down at the worst of times. You can use your own quote, but this one is so so profound and perfect.
 In Frank Herber's ""Dune"" book series (which is by the way an ah-maziiing Sci fi fantasy that inspired Star Wars) there is this mantra that people say to deal with paralyzing fear. In the book series, people have involved into highly intelligent beings capable to control their body and mind to the fullest degree. And that's the trick they use in their crazy war if a life: 

""I must not fear.
Fear is the mind-killer.
Fear is the little-death that brings total obliteration.
I will face my fear.
I will permit it to pass over me and through me.
And when it has gone past I will turn the inner eye to see its path.
Where the fear has gone there will be nothing.
Only I will remain.""

I have repeated it in my head again and again and again in horrible situations, once even my life was kind of in danger, lol, and every world of it was PERFECT, it just makes so much sense. Fear is just a feeling. If it weren't here I would be able to achieve so much more success an any given situation. It comes and goes and I'm the constant. Also, it distracts you, gives your mind some release from racing thoughts and calms you down by the repetition alone. Reciting uses the logical part of your brain to cancel out the screaming emotional part. And in the end of the day, that litany is some damn good advice. Try this or any other mantra and hopefully it helps you as well! ",0,2018-10-11 21:55:36 EDT-0400

1063,For those confused on how this can really be a thing,"Yesterday was world mental health day, and I spent a lot of time thinking about my journey this past year and all the shit that I have had to go through in order to be in a place now where I feel comfortable waking up, facing the world, and facing myself.

I have had general anxiety for as long as I can remember, but it was only about a year ago that I truly started to feel like I was on the verge of death. I remember being at college and walking up a flight of stairs to class and getting to the top and being SO out of breath. That was the first time I started to believe that something was truly wrong with me: a tumor in my lungs (my grandfather had found a tumor in his lung about a year prior and died 6 months after), a deflated lung, some heart murmur, or something that would put me on my death bed sooner rather than later. After multiple (and multiple) doctors appointments trying to convince my GP that I was on the verge of death, he said he thought it was simple anxiety and nothing to worry about. That's when things started to go downhill for me.

Being told that I had anxiety was not some saving grace for me, because I truly had no support around me (which is something that I believe that many people here and in general deal with, and mostly why I'm writing this post). My parents had never experienced anxiety before, so when I told them that I didn't feel like doing anything that day or if I just started crying because I felt anxious, they truly thought that I was either a) overexaggerating whatever problem I felt or b) begging for attention. This only made me more anxious, and only exacerbated the problem.

My friends, also, had never had anxiety. One of my friends is so care-free and doesn't get anxious about anything, and when I would confine in her about how I was feeling, she would tell me to ""snap out of it"" or ""get through it."" My worst panic attacks my senior year of college were at parties, and when I started to realize this, I spent a lot of time alone and avoiding these parties, to which her reply was ""we only live once, you're being annoying and you're going to regret this.""

I am writing this for the person reading this who feels like they are not understood. You are allowed, and encouraged, to do WHATEVER YOU WANT (of course, considering legal limits) to deal with your anxiety. If you want to go drink with friends, GO. If you want to stay in and watch Netflix, STAY IN. Your mental health is YOUR mental health. It's no one else's. I understand that not everyone sees mental health the same way, but believe me, even if it feels like no one is on your side, we all are.

Since then, I have come to find that one of my best friends has been battling life crippling anxiety for a lot longer than I knew her for. We are able to confine in each other about our anxiety attacks, our problems, and our worries. Our good days and our bad days. You will find people who love you, and respect your mental health. Please, please please, remember that. Until then, I am always a message away. I hope no one ever feels as misunderstood as I did. xoxo ",0,2018-10-11 22:59:42 EDT-0400
1064,Questions about applying for disability with an anxiety/depression/PTSD diagnosis,"Each week is getting harder and harder for me. I've been ""working"" at home doing art and it suited me well for a little while, but in the last few years my anxiety has gotten worse and worse as I've gone through some really traumatic struggles and now I can't even sit still and focus on anything for more than a few minutes at a time.

I have clients angry at me, utilities about to shut off, overdue house payments and a massive mountain of to-do items that I can't even deal with without having a panic attack for no goddamn reason. 

I'm seeing a psychiatrist and therapist, I'm on Prozac which is somewhat helpful, in that I don't want to die anymore, but I can't get to ""normal"" feeling point for more than a few hours out of a week.

I want to reduce stressors in every way possible, and one of my worst monsters right now is the constant struggle to scrape a few dollars together just to afford cat food, much less the really urgent stuff. I did a quick search for applying for disability benefits and while it seems I may qualify, every site seems to be a law office.

Do I really need to hire a lawyer to submit an application? 

What do I need to have in order to support my claim?

Do I need a diagnosis or evaluation by primary care physician as well as my current psych/therapist? 

How hard is the process or approval?

1065,I'm lost and don't understand what's wrong with me.,"Hey there, if this is not the right subreddit, please let me know. I'm at a point where I'm completely lost and need some feedback, and figured reddit might be of help. 

I'll try to shortly sketch my situation. I've always been a very insecure person, and  bullying experiences obviously did not do me any good. I'm now 24 years old and studying to be nurse (which I am very passionate about). I have these days where for no reason I am extremely down on myself. I have zero controle over my emotions and everything around me is negative. It feels negative. The slightest remark can throw me completely off balance. And I hate to lose this control. At those times I am not kind to those around which I always regret when I come to my senses. On the contrary I also have days where I'm very inspired, creative and optimistic. Those kind of days happen at randomly. This week I started my first internship for school to learn some basics of the job as a nurse. I started early this morning and every mistake I made got pointed out (obviously, since I have to learn and get feedback). I felt my throat tighten up and tears coming up and tried to surpress this. The nurse guiding me noticed my eyes were red and told me to not pannick, this made it worse. I had to breath in and out a few times to get to my senses. But throughout the whole day this never got better. I felt extremely sensitive for everything around me, the slightes remark, or look threw me off. I felt so insecure and lost without any control of my emotions. I held my tears in for the rest of the day but was constantly on the break of crying. Untill my shift almost ended. I had to write a selfreflection and completely crashed. I started sweating heavily and crying and sobbing. My breathing was unsteady and I just couldn't calm down. Everyone was so suprised and I felt so ashamed. People were comforting me saying, you can make mistakes, you'll learn and grow etc.. But those words did not calm me down. When I walked home I cried even more, I have completely lost control of my emotions and this makes me so angry. I'm afraid this will start interfering with future work too.. I'm lost. Is this all due to my insecurity? am I depressed or something? fear of failing? anxiety? Does anyone else have this feeling? ",2,2018-10-11 18:18:32 EDT-0400

I have crippling social anxiety which makes any form of presenting almost physically impossible for me.

Today I had to do a minute talk in front of my boss, two colleagues and two potential clients.  This kind of scenario is an absolute killer for me and is not something that I would usually have any chance of succeeding with (or even completing)

I took 30mg of propranol an hour before the event, and another 30mg 10 minutes before the event. (Total of 60)

I was horrified all throughout the lead up, but when I finally came to speak - my voice worked.  It worked, it was smooth, i had plenty of breath, i could get my words out.  I've never experienced so much ease with talking in this kind of situation before, usually it is such a fight against my body in order to get my words out, but this was absolutely unbelievable, the tight grip around me was free.

but searching up my symptoms trying to figure out what this is and all I get is panic attacks. ive had a panic attack - this isn't that - is it???? because my panic attacks can start over nothing (and usually my panic attacks might be preceded by an anxiety episode like this), but this anxiety builds up like a stress. these sort of anxiety attacks aren't fun and leave me in that similar adrenaline ridden deflated state. am I just stupid for not knowing this was a panic attack too all along - ive been saying to doctors ive had only around 7 panic attacks in my life, but if this is a panic attack too it changes everything...",2,2018-10-31 23:11:20 EDT-0400
1083,New here and just need some reassurance,"Hey, guys! First-time poster here! I'm a 22 year old female who's just been feeling really ""off"" these past few days. I've been unable to sleep in my room. It feels really hot in there, and then of course, I start panicking and have trouble taking deep breaths. I'm just scared for some reason. I just feel like I have a knot in my chest that won't go away. In addition, my left arm aches and my left foot just randomly feels tingly and cold. Of course, I start overthinking and worrying that I have something majorly wrong with me. I called my mom (she's a doctor), and she thinks I'm just showing symptoms of hypochondria, telling me not to worry and that we have anxiety-prone people in our family (namely, my aunt). 

I should also note that I've been in the habit of drinking an iced coffee at least once a day, which I've been trying to stop since it's been affecting me worse than usual lately. I had my first panic attack after drinking coffee two years ago, which was a very frightening experience. Since then, I've had one more serious attack this past spring. Now, I just feel jittery and have trouble sleeping. Anyway, I'm sorry this is all over the place. I just needed somewhere to let this out. I'll be applying to medical school next summer, and I can't wait to just be able to have the proper level of medical education to discern whether symptoms are concerning or not. Haha!

1084,DAE get anxious seeing people who do better than you in school/work?,"I'm in university. Because of past mental health issues, my grades are not great, which closes many doors and I don't even know if I can pursue my dreams. I look at those people who have great grades, friends and a social life. They are always jolly and laughing. Obviously they may have their own problems, but that actually makes me feel worse. I really love my major and like to be proactive in class and stay up to date on coursework. But recently my anxiety (which I had kept manageable for over a year) has kicked in very bad. I look at these people and I panic. It hurts a lot. I no longer feel like doing my coursework and that is gonna further screw everything up. Worst thing is that somewhere in the back of my mind, I know that I am as good as, if not better than the people who cause me these panic attacks. But just seeing them scares me. 

I wonder if this is strange or others with anxiety have experienced something of the sort?",1,2018-11-01 00:42:33 EDT-0400

1086,Finally Getting Help,"After years of diagnosed and untreated anxiety I have finally worked up the courage to go to the psychiatrist and get on my medication. I struggle seeing mental health professionals of any kind, my mom is a therapist who never respected privacy laws. She would always tell stories about her patients, but never use their names so she claimed she wasn't breaking any rules. I heard so many awful stories and I have so many myself and I don't want to be anyone's bar story so I have avoided getting help for far too long. Today is my 2nd day back on Lexapro and I am just so hopeful that I'll finally get this under control.

1090,How do you work? Every job I’ve had has given me anxiety,"When I worked in a lab in college, at two schools as A teacher I always had awful anxiety about just going to work. At work nobody would talk to me, people would gossip about me and I knew they hated me. I even thought of breaking an arm at one point to get out of my last job because it was just too much. I’ve had panic attacks at work, broke down crying endless times, and have been hated. The only job where I didn’t have that much anxiety was when I worked briefly at the zoo, it was a petting zoo and I’d take breaks to feed animals and they made me feel better.

1093,Does anyone experience similar?,"I'm not going to go into the full detail and history behind this problem as that would take a long time and it is very complex. Currently, I live in a house that is a stable environment, though it wasn't always, but every time I come home I get an anxiety attack. I will get anxiety in the morning, and when I come home I will get an anxiety attack. Meal time is absolute hell, as I am falling apart while trying to make accommodations for others and answer their questions while suffocating and eating voraciously to cope with the stress. Often, I want to even come home early because I get tired of spending all day outside of the home, but that initial excitement fades away by the time I am halfway home. At this point, I get this awful feeling in my stomach, like it's about to implode. This terrible, unnerving feeling grows and once I near home, it turns into anxiety. By the time I enter the driveway, I am extremely anxious. At this point it is a battle to maintain stability and not fall apart between the time I arrive home, and however long it takes until the house is quiet and everyone is asleep. Today, I came home earlier than normal because it is halloween and I wanted to. Suffice to say, it has been no more than 3 hours since I came, and I am barely stable. This happens, almost everyday, though I usually come really late, which makes it much easier to deal with. Again, there is much much more to why I am feeling this way, and why I get so anxious, but it would take pages of explanation since there are so many details. Does anyone else experience something like this. It doesn't have to be your home, it could be a workplace you go to or a school. Just some place involving other people, who aren't necessarily bad, but that are very triggering.",1,2018-11-01 05:54:40 EDT-0400

Every time I get even into the smallest of debates, I'll *always* feel like the bad guy, even if I didn't cause it or even if I'm right. I hate making people upset so I'd rather admit I'm wrong (even if I'm not) or apologise just so it pacifies the other person. I always visualise fake or past arguments in my head where I say what I actually wanted to say and it makes me feel angry but it's also empowering because I'm saying what's on my mind without the consequences of saying it for real.

1097,"Exercise... seriously, do it.","I have battled anxiety for nearly ten years now. I’ve been on and off antidepressants (been off almost two years). Over the years I have used CBT, therapy, and mindfulness meditation to reduce my anxiety with moderate success, but I still “slip” a lot and it can come back with a vengeance sometimes. 

I recently kind of “stumbled” into exercise. I used to hate it and dread it as nothing more than a means to burning calories and eventually losing weight. But after reading a ton on how it can help anxiety and depression (which I’ve known for years) I casually just said “Ok what the heck?”. Lots of people take medicine everyday for anxiety, why can’t I try this as a form of medicine? 

So for the last week, my husband and I have been waking up at five to work out before work (I’ve learned that it NEVER happens after because I’m a teacher and I get exhausted at work). The results? AMAZING. I have felt more at ease in the last week than I have in years. I only work out for thirty minutes and I do a variety of strength and cardio. The type of exercise does not seem to have any effect on the amount of relief. Even just a brisk walk can do it. I can not recommend it enough. Don’t wait to try it like I did. Seriously. A doctor gave me this advice years ago and I wish I would have listened. Go get your CDC-recommended 150 minutes a week and see what it does for your anxiety. I think you will be amazed.

1099,Panic attacks? Don't drink Caffeine or Alcohol... and drink lots of water and add Salt to your diet.,"That includes cups of tea, coca-cola, lucozade and of course, energy drinks, soda, fizzy drinks. (Camomile tea can be a good replacement though! has very little caffeine. Also try green tea or getting hold of ""theanine"" apparently makes you feel alert but less jittery-thanks whoever told me that in the comments!) Can buy it on amazon.

Alcohol stays in your system for ages and messes with your head, as well as gives you increased palpitations etc. Can also develop into a bad coping mechanism where you drink more to stop the anxious feelings, but the next morning you wake up its ten times worse!

Water and salt- good for fighting off low blood pressure which a some people with anxiety may get, might be why sometimes you get dizziness, jelly legs, light-headedness etc. (**some people have high blood pressure from anxiety so staying off the salt and actually increasing caffeine can help- however I think the majority can benefit from less caffeine and alcohol and more water!) Thanks for people mentioning that.**

1103,In case nobody’s told you: It’s okay to be average.,"A letter to you, and to me:

In case nobody has told you yet; today, or ever in your life, it’s okay to be average.
There used to be a time in which average was celebrated. You helped your tribe live, you helped your family with basic labor, you got an average job that paid for the basics in life.

But nowadays, we are so connected to everything in the world through modern technology that we only hear about the extraordinary. The stardom, the wealth, the self-made men and women, the prodigies, the brilliant people who have found the formula to promote themselves and find a following in such a noisy world. 
And amongst all this, it’s so easy to not feel good enough. Indeed, everyday I feel myself fighting that constant itch of insufficiency.
Look at all these people out there who are so much more capable than me.

But it’s okay to be average. Truly, it’s just fine. Most everyone is. Most people have average intelligence, average income, average popularity, just a few friends, an average relationship. But few people celebrate being average anymore, only the best and most extraordinary. And it’s destroying our collective psyche. We are becoming less happy and less self-secure.

So here’s to you, average, not outstanding person. Whether you still live at home or don’t have a good job, or have never been on a date or are overweight and unsatisfied with your body. You are doing great! Being average is just fine. Don’t give up on your goals, certainly, but don’t criticize yourself for not standing out or not fulfilling your greatest potential; indeed, most of us haven’t. Imagine how much more comfortable everyone would be if we were as sharing of our insecurities and shortcomings as we were our successes and accomplishments. Maybe everyone would feel okay to just be living and trying.

And remember, NO MATTER WHAT, You are still worthwhile, important, brave for facing the world each day, in your own way. Keep it up.

EDIT: sorry for the misspellings, I’m just an average guy :) ",79,2018-07-23 20:53:39 EDT-0400

1123,"Stay up late at night worrying about possibilities I can't control (nuclear war, severely disabled future child).","I currently have a career that I love, am planning a wedding, and after that hoping to have a baby.  I mostly feel happy and excited about all of this.  However, it almost feels ""too good"" -- I can't wrap my head around why my own life is so pleasant when so many other humans have died of diseases, lived in slavery, suffered terrible discrimination, and so on.  Maybe as a reaction to that, when I am trying to fall asleep, I suddenly start envisioning all sorts of horrible things that could happen to me.  Here are the two biggest ones (which are not really compatible with one another).

1. There might be a nuclear war with North Korea (both the US and North Korea have somewhat unstable despots, so it feels possible.)  In that case, maybe I shouldn't be spending thousands of dollars on a wedding photographer and florist, but instead spend that money trying to flee to Canada or something.
2. I might end up having a severely disabled child who is violent and/or never learns to speak, who thus ruins my finances, my marriage, and my career.  Would I be able to give such a child up for adoption?  I panic about this too.  If I were pregnant, I think I'd panic even more (which might be bad for the baby).

Of course, these fears are unlikely to come true, but they truly pervade my life.  (Maybe I subconsciously believe that if I worry enough, I can prevent these things from happening.)  Ironically, I spend very little time worrying about dying of hypoglycemia, even though that has nearly happened to me before and could easily happen again, since I take insulin for my type 1 diabetes.  But for some reason that doesn't weigh on me as much.

Does anyone have any tips for overcoming these fears?

1135,Need help with workplace anxiety and stress – lengthy post - possible pure OCD issue - Long post!," Hi all, 

I just thought I would share some of my feelings with you guys on issues I’m going through right now. Please forgive me for such a long post (its intimidating to even look at, I know).   

I really really need to be super clear in how I feel. I also think of myself as a manly guy (into boxing, weights and war literature) and am crippled by further embarrassment as expressing my feelings in the following way is a bit of a feminine thing to do.  As a prologue, I would say its pretty much safe to say that I live in my head.  

I’m in my early 30's married with a beautiful daughter. My problem right now lies with the world of work.  Right now I work for a very well known and respected international corporate company and have been for around 6 years in numerous fancy sounding roles. My pay in reality isn’t fantastic but as a lot of things in life I project an image of social stability which many would crave. To highlight the level of corporation I work for I have been stopped several times by people in trains and coffee shops even wanting to know if I can get them a job in said company (as I had the company badge around my neck) – which highlights how well known it is. I’m only telling you this to highlight that even though inside I feel shit and insecure I somehow managed to snag a role in a well respected company. 

I’ve always hated working office roles and ultimately having a boss. That’s it in a nutshell. Every job I’ve ever had I’ve seemed to run into trouble. I was let go (terminated) for a couple of temping type jobs in my younger days before I found some stability in these permanent roles I’m in right now. My work history here has been up and down too. I’ve had some technical support type roles under difficult management where my work wavered between considered subpar to truly excellent and worthy of awards at fancy corporate events. I’ve just missed out on internal high-level promotions even though having been given outstanding feedback from interviewers because I simply didn’t have some relative experience they were looking for which actually assisted my self-esteem quite a bit. Currently I’m working in one of their solutions software teams and let’s just say I’ve ran into a bit more trouble as of late. I’ve been sitting on queries and some of my work has been subpar which has lead to informal reviews and possible discussions with the HR team now for formal disciplinary action. The thought of this makes me feel a bit nauseous at how I’ve got myself into this but its largely a fear of turning to help from superiors in case I appear to be incompetent. I deal with a lot of internal anxiety in my head if I’m honest and overthinking sometimes plays a part in this. 

Here is an example of a moment of my working life:

If I want to ask a question about something before I send an email off or ask someone I will be thinking a million things in my head “should I send this, will I look incompetent in front of my peers for not knowing or I may have asked the question before and they are judging me more, maybe the accumulation of this thinking will make me look shit in my end of year review or will be held against me as someone who needs to be dismissed”. My past will creep in when I’ve gotten into trouble at work before for similar reasons. It’s like a massive train wreck of anxiety. 

In many ways its impacted my normal domestic life. I believe its played a part in turning me into an isolated and brooding figure outside of work (whereas at work I can project the image of someone who is charming, charismatic and funny). The dual figure can be quite bizarre. What makes things worse is that every single person around me seems to have their shit and life in gear. Married with children and in successful careers. I’m left thinking – am I the only person out their who feels so shit out there in society?  

I think after a year or so in a role some level of ennui creeps into me and I lack the drive in jobs. I’ve been told off at times for asking the same question again to internal colleagues along with a few other issues. I’ve lived with a certain anxiety now in terms of this and a fear of losing my role within the team. 

A strong part of me just wants to go out and do something else now instead of the role I’m currently doing. I don’t believe that I’m cut out largely for these corporate type roles and that I’m built for something else but I live with a certain anxiety which constantly follows me. What if I go into another field and the same issues follow me there? What if I make a leap into something else but I fail terribly? 

Can I do this with a wife and child in hand?

There are things which I love doing – I’m a voracious reader of literature and naturally gregarious and sociable with people (when I want to be, I have this strange and frustrating habit of being able to switch it off when I want to much to the annoyance and chagrin of people at home) and enjoy writing when not dealing with severe mental blocks. I’m also a good public speaker (part of public speaking organisations) and actually enjoy the feeling of being watched upon by the crowd and I have certifications in teaching by well respected bodies. I’m pretty sure I have undiagnosed Pure OCD however which can be borderline crippling at times.  I’ve never secured any therapy for this as once again I have felt subconsciously that it’s a weakling thing to do. 

Moving onto a dream job seems like a fantasy, as I feel I will always be haunted by the notion of failure and not succeeding.  

I just need some help guys.  I feel like a lost cause at times, but I keep it well hidden from others.

1137,I feel so guilty,"I don’t understand why I feel so guilty about putting in my notice at my job in a few weeks. I’ve known for years that it needs to happen and that I need a change, but I’m freaking out. 

I guess I feel like a manager quitting leaves a huge power gap. I feel like everything is going to mess up once I leave. I know that’s irrational, but I can’t seem to find peace with myself.

1138,Does anyone else worry about things happening just because they heard about it elsewhere?,"I feel like the second I hear about something bad happening I instantly panic about it myself. I know it’s partly my OCD but it’s a huge source of my anxiety. 

For example earlier someone posted about their cat getting trapped in their washing machine and dying and I flew into a full-blown panic about the same thing happening to me despite how unlikely it is, and how I’ve never worried about it before.

Same thing happens reading news articles or posts about car crashes or cancer, my mind immediately associates it with my own life. Just hate the constant negative thoughts. 

How do other people cope with it? Usually I just have to try and distract myself but it’s often easier said than done... ",2,2018-11-16 14:40:46 EST-0500
1139,All my friends is passing interviews while me (21M) never succeed even once.,"So all my friends are passing big companies interviews. They only applied a few companies and they succeed really easily. They passed those interviews without any problems, because they said they didn’t even prepare for it. 

While me, applied for 30+ companies and failed everyone. 0 companies passed, not even the first interview. In those 30+ companies I went to interviews like 6 times, other 24+ companies I didn’t even passed CV screening. For each of interviews I spent at least 3-4 hours to prepare. But I just continuously receiving refuse letters.

I felt extremely down and paranoid, worrying that I’ll become jobless in the future.

And the difference is so huge!! They passed big companies interviews without preparing for it! While me, 4 hours preparing even can’t bring me at least 1 success at even first interview.

My therapist told me that she believes I’m a boy with good potential and skills, so it’s not my problem.

But after what happened, I really can’t believe what she said. I continuously think that I’m a useless person and attacking myself with pessimistic views.

Who can help me...

Anyway, thanks to everyone who read until now.

1143,A Surgery Is Coming Up For Me-May be triggering for some people,"A Surgery is coming up for me and I've been terrified to go through with it even though I really need it. 

I need a surgery on my left knee to fix a big, inflamed tear in my meniscus. In my 15 years I've been alive, I've had around 4-5 surgeries. ( I may have had one when I was little for tubes in my ears, I just can't remember. ) I don't know why this surgery gives me so much anxiety. I'm just terrified that something will go wrong and I won't be able to walk again. It probably sound far fetched but I'm so scared I haven't been able to sleep right since I've gotten the news. (Which was only a few days ago.)  Me and my mother are going tomorrow to the doctors to get a knee stabilizer. I'm just so fucking scared and so filled with anxiety I don't know what to do and I needed to tell someone. Thanks for reading. I appreciate it.


Update: Me and my mother went to the doctors and got the knee brace. It's not helping with the pain at all. (really its making more bc of the way my muscules have to work now) But it is doing it's job so I guess that's good. I'm still worried as hell for the surgery bc we had already planned and mostly paid for a trip that requires a lot of walking  way before we had gotten the news. I'm just scared that the trip will cause a bigger tear in it. Thanks for reading again. Will keep try to you guys posted, even though I know this isn't going to blow up lol.

My god I almost never leave my house and when I do my head turns into chaos but today it was just calmness. I'm so so surprised.

1147,I made a small accomplishment today! I managed to go to the gym alone.,"After months of being stuck in a loop of staying indoors and not stepping outside my comfort zone, I decided that I needed to challenge myself and do something that I haven’t done before. 

Usually I go to the gym with my boyfriend, but even then, it has to be on a day when it is quiet, otherwise I feel overwhelmed. 

I had gotten kinda out of shape as I haven’t been to the gym now for around 3 months. 

Honestly, I’ve been starting to get super negative thoughts about the way I look so I really wanted to change that before it gets worse. For me, working out is one of the few things that I actually enjoy doing! A bonus is that it helps me sleep like a rock. 

I kept telling myself that the worst that could happen would be if I get something wrong, and people stare at me- but so what? No one really cares about what others do in the gym. 

With this in mind, I managed a great workout session and I plan to keep it up. I feel amazing! 

Taking small steps and even having the intention of doing something new is a good step to take.  I hope you guys work towards doing something new today. ☺️

1149,My anxiety story. To the bully on the bus who doesnt understand anxiety.,"I am a fairly physically healthy male, in my 30s, living in Toronto, Canada. I have had anxiety as long as i can remember. And lucky for me, after years of therapy, medication and understanding my anxiety is mostly under control. Weird as this may sound, i feel almost feel like i have grown into it. Its a part of who I am.

However, from time to time extreme panic still creeps up on me. This time the attack ihappened as I was getting on a public bus. For whatever reason I was having a bad day, on a cloudy dark day and my anxiety went into full blown panic mode. 

On this date it was raining heavily and i was attempting to getting the bus to come home from work. As my panic took over I was drenched, frozen, having extreme vertigo and barely able to stand up on my own. I felt like the floor wasnt even and any second i was going to faceplant on the sidewalk.

The bus finally comes. Thank god. I get on. Its packed, no seats. I inform the driver quietly i needed a seat and he announces loudly if someone could give me a seat. Someone does, thank you to whoever this was. At this point i am just focusing on my breathing and trying not to remember the 100 eyes on me as i try to slump down out of sight.

I reach for my Xanax. My doctor prescribes 0.5 mg pills to me for this very instance. For the occasional time when my panic reaches epic levels and i lose control. Looking down and trying not to cause more attention, I quietly try to take out my medication and to use it and wait 20 minutes til it superseeds. I am past the part where i think this is a heart attack. This is a panic attack and i have to wait it out as best as i can.

This is where the bully on the bus comes in. As i take my pill, i hear a male voice saying something along the lines of "" No wonder your dizzy, stop popping pills and you will be able to walk you junkie.""

A tide of anger, frustration, sadness, embaressment came over me in this moment. I tried to defend myself with a ""you dont know me, this is my medication"" but i was to weak and ashamed to fight back. I sat the rest of the ride in shame wondering how many eyes, cameras, wispers were on me at that moment.

I mainly am sharing this story to vent but also to say to those who choose to use medication to control your anxiety its nothing you should feel ashamed about. You didnt choose to have anxiety and you have the right to make an educated decision on how you choose to deal with it.

And to my bully on that bus, i ask you not to be so judgemental when you see someone reach for a pill. Its not always a addict looking for a fix. It could be someone making a choice to take a medication to alliveate their short term symptoms. Please dont be so quick to judge a stranger

I would have loved to have been able to have a chat with my insulter when I was up to it. However at that moment all i was focusing on was beating that panic. However, i forgive you stranger and I hope you never have to experience anxiety. I wouldnt wish it on my worst enemy.

Thanks for reading and gl to all those who have anxiety.",57,2018-06-05 01:21:55 EDT-0400

My boyfriend (21M) invited me to a staff party at his work place -where I know no one- and I actually decided to go. I decided to have a drink and didn’t really worry about the affect.. I drank it pretty quickly for me. He introduced me to some of his friends who we sat in a booth with and ate some food and chatted and sang to the music...

1155,Had a panic attack. Inadvertently scared the shit out of my boyfriend and an entire convention. I've never been so humiliated before.,"Was at a con. There was an event. It was *very* full and I felt super overwhelmed. A friend asked if I was okay and I started to have a panic attack. He lead me to a side room. Asked if I wanted space. Said yes. Sat there for some time. Friend came back in to check on me. I said the attack was over and I felt out of it. Said I'd go to the shop and get a drink.

When I get back, my boyfriend is coming out the door.  He hugs me and explains they thought I'd disappeared and hurt myself. There was a miscommunication and somehow, all anyone seemed to know was that I felt overwhelmed befits the game and looked kind of out of it. 

Boyfriend was terrified and kinda angry that I didn't tell him. Was hurt that I didn't tell him. But honestly, I was thinking only of the panic during the attack. Apparently I was out of it for at least an hour, then went to get a drink while still out of it so I wasn't thinking straight.

I learned how to talk to people properly since i gotta do that all the time. Asking what flavour, how many scoops, cup or cone, answering their questions and the money part. 
I also have to make small talk with the customers sometimes like ""are you enjoying the ice cream?"".

It can be hard sometimes because i stutter or say the wrong things, or i get very nervous and warm when i mess up the milkshake toppings. 
My coworker has been helping me with serving the customers their drink at the table and what to say to them. I hate these little practicing things because i get very nervous when doing this. I know what to say, but when i say it it comes out the wrong way and i'll feel bad about it the whole day.

But i can finally talk to customers the right way and i hope this will help me outside of work too.  I already notice myself asking more instead of giving up. I feel proud about it. College will be coming and i hope i can have a full normal conversation with someone

I’ll get a cold sore on my mouth at the most inopportune times/when I’m freaking out. 

I have huge pimples or boils on my chest, thighs, scalp and ass. They’re deep and larger than a quarter. They hurt to sit on, when my clothes rub against them or if I touch them. They hurt a lot. 30% of them are not even in suspect spots. I get them on my stomach area, not just sweaty spots. 

I shower daily and use prescription strength shampoo but still don’t have a clear scalp. I have numerous somewhat large/noticeable bald spots because of this. I’ve seen multiple doctors but I think they think it’s a hygiene thing. I swear it’s not. 

I use salicylic acid body wash daily but still break out. I live in a cool and dry environment for the most part and don’t work on a farm or anything like that.

1176,Anxiety and Sex," Hi all,

I have been with my partner for more than six years, starting as teens. He was my first sexual partner, and even though I am 100% comfortable in our relationship, I continue to struggle immensely with the sexual aspect of things. He is so attractive to me, and I do want to be intimate with him, but I just panic almost every time we enter that zone (anything beyond kissing, really). My partner is incredibly supportive, but I just don't know what to do.

Have any of you experienced similar? How have you adjusted? How did you overcome your fears?

My partner and I are so in love and so committed to each other, and he is so caring. How can I get better? I feel so broken and so confused by my fears in this area.",4,2018-11-26 06:31:18 EST-0500
1177,I'm scared of growing up,"I'm graduating college in less than 2 years and part of me is really excited for the future.  I grew up with overprotective parents and I'll finally be independent.

&#x200B;

However, everywhere I go everyone tells me how terrible adult life is.  My family tells me how easy I have it and how terrible working is.  My dad tries to scare me by telling me I'll be working 70 hours a week as an engineer unless I get a job working for the federal government (I don't want to work for the fed govt. or any contractors).  My older brother and sister tell me the same thing about how things get worse.  Even on Reddit, there's this huge circle-jerk about how life after college sucks.  I saw a post today and everyone in the comments was saying how after college everything turns to shit and you can't have fun anymore.  A switch flips and I can't go to parties or do reckless shit anymore.  I have to forever live with a stick up my ass.

&#x200B;

I know adult-life has a lot of responsibilities, but why can't I still do fun things?  If my best years are behind me, what's the point of going on?  It doesn't feel like they're behind me.

1188,SO has lost interest in sex,"My SO has been dealing with a lot of anxiety lately and I understand that she needs time to get bad to feeling ""good"". I have told her that I will not pushing her to do anything sexual until she is ready. The thing is she very guarded and communication is something she struggles with. I have repeatedly told her I can wait until she is ready and she says ""ok"", it been almost 2 months and it's getting frustrating. Can anyone give me some help or advice?

Thanks",4,2018-11-26 04:11:47 EST-0500

1190,Crisis of identity,"Hey so quick background. I'm 19 and in my second year doing maths at uni and I'm dropping out. I hate it. Well, I like maths but not as a degree so I know staying to do it will make my anxiety/depression worse. I already feel like shit 24/7. I haven't gone to lectures in months, I have no intention to go to lectures but I don't know what to do.

Thing is I have always loved art. Specifically photography. For A levels I was torn between the academic route or the creative route and I took the academic route which I don't want to do. I was looking at fine art degrees and was pretty determined in doing that and starting again. But now I don't know if it's what I want to do. I don't want to make the same mistake and waste more time and money that I don't have. I feel sick to my stomach and I'm constantly crying and panicking because I don't know what to do. Because I'm dropping out people want to know what my plan is and truthfully I don't have one that I want. I'm scared I'm never going to find something I want to do. I hate living sometimes.

I know I can wait to see what I end up in and that I have so many years to choose but I need to find something to do now that doesn't make me suicidal and I can't see anything. I'm just so stressed and so scared.

Anyone been in a similar situation? Even if not, feel free to give any advice that doesn't include sticking it out and finishing the maths degree. I'm not doing it. I'd rather quit halfway through than waste time to fail.",1,2018-11-26 17:05:38 EST-0500
1191,Spent three years of highschool ignoring my problems to deal with anxiety,"And now they’re catching up to me and I feel powerless. Seriously, I feel not ready at all to deal with adult life, and my anxiety is reaching extreme levels. I dealt with this before simply by ignoring my problems altogether, which bought me blissful everyday life but at the cost of it all catching up to me at once.
I can’t, but I want to have a little break on all of those things for a while.

 I have absolutely zero idea on what I want to do on the future or if I could ever deal with the extra baggage of adult life. I’ve friends, but none the type that know or want to deal with emotional stuff, I’m very much the same, but I just can’t escape from it.


Anyways in the end I just felt like sharing my problems somewhere, I don’t know what answer to expect and I know myself that the questions I’m dealing with right now should have been dealt with a long time ago, it’s the rant of an eighteen year old and I’m sure my problems are at most minor on comparison to what other people have to struggle through. But I don’t know if i the anxiety will ever really stop, and I know I can’t be a functional person living in society with it.",1,2018-11-26 11:50:42 EST-0500
