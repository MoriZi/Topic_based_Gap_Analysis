1,Merry X-mas to us loners.,"Many of us who suffer from anxiety and/or depression celebrate x-mas among other holidays completely alone for a million different reasons.

3,"Hey you (yes, you!)","Whatever today holds, I hope you find some peace and have some smiles :) You deserve them, you wonderful being.

It is human to have blips, to revert to our old coping mechanisms, it is what we do after which shows how far we have come in recovery.

You are loved, you are valid and you matter in this world.

Merry Christmas, and I will be about if anyone wants a message :)",18,2014-12-25 14:16:04 EST-0500
4,[RANT] I always feel like everyone secretly hates me..,"I'm so sick of it. It doesn't matter what I do or who I hang out with. I could be hanging out with my best friends and when I come home and sit down to relax I replay everything I said and did and somehow I convince myself that they hate me. I wish I could stop but I feel like it's so impossible. I don't necessarily think I'm a horrible person. I'm stuck in a bit of a rut right now, I don't have a job, I had to move back in with my parents but it's not the end of the world. So why do I have to keep torturing myself like this? I know that half the shit I think about isn't even true so why does this bug me so much? 

I'm sorry for ranting, guys. I just really need to get this off my chest.",55,2014-12-28 13:57:32 EST-0500

7,Does anyone else experience increased anxiety while PMSing?,"I'm on medication for depression and anxiety and have noticed that during the few days leading up to my period my anxiety goes through the roof.

9,Anyone else suffer from scopophobia (fear of being looked at)?,"I've suffered from this as long as I can remember, but it is only recently that I discovered a name for it. Being looked at makes me feel sick and intensely anxious. Maintaining eye contact with people is a nightmare for me, and I always breathe a sigh of relief when they leave or look away. I'm in a long-distance relationship, and Skype calls make me nearly have a panic attack. Skype is one of the worst offenders for this- I find it almost unbearable usually.

I suspect this is a subset of social anxiety rather than regular anxiety, but I thought some people here might be able to relate. I've had a lot of bad experiences with therapy, and I wonder what the options are when it comes to treating this.",19,2014-12-24 00:32:35 EST-0500

11,3 things I do that help me reduce my anxiety right away,"Those 3 things are really effective and work for me, but only for the short term.

1. When I am starting to feel stress and panicking, I contract all of my body muscles for like 10-15 seconds and then release them all at once. I repeat it 2 or 3 times. (if you are around people, just go to the bathroom and do this).

2. I take a few deep breathes and tell myself ""I am safe"", ""everything is OK"".
I inhale deep to my stomach, hold it for 3 seconds and let it go for 5 seconds.

3. I force myself to smile. That makes me feel better in no time. Sometimes I even try to remember something funny to neutralize the anxiety I feel.

What are your ""instant anxiety release"" ways? ",17,2014-12-22 22:34:09 EST-0500
12,"I'm always afraid that I have a brain tumor, or any kind of cancer, spinal meningitis, pregnant, ect...it just recently occurs to me that this is anxiety [Help]","I guess I could say I've been dying my whole life, always terrified I was dying of one disease or another I just never went to the doctor because of how terrified i am of them and hospitals and lastly finding out that I actually was dying and having to live a limited lifestyle. So i guess my parents always thought i was fine when i really i wasnt but i didnt even understand what was really wrong with me

that was all from probably 9 to 12, then the social anxiety started to kick in...im sort of a loud person. i guess i compensate. people dont totally understand that im pretty shy, well actually sometimes i come off really shy. it just depends on who im with and where you meet me. 

I'm 22 now, i hate the way i sound. i hate my face and body. hate my words. the words are the worst. i say  or do something that seems okay in my head but when i do it its never cool or funny. 

I have failed in relationships. Lots of times. Can't even begin to explain. 

I try not to eat. Except at night but that really has to do with all of the holiday parties I've been going to, lots of food there. 

I guess i goto alot of parties, like one every night for the past week and a half. But i go alone, i leave alone. I might get a cab or a ride or pass out on a friends couch. I always embarrass myself with my words. 

I chainsmoke cigarettes. That started when I went to school, but it stuck. 

is this anxiety?

13,"I haven't left my house for 4 years, think I might be agoraphobic","I haven't been outside at all since the summer of 2010. I haven't been able to get diagnosed with anything due to being unable to leave my house (doctors don't do home visits unless you're dying here, basically), but I think I've got agoraphobia because most of the symptoms seem to apply to me. I'm worried that if I don't leave the house soon I might end up literally spending the rest of my life as a shut-in. I also think lack of sunlight is affecting my health because I've been indoors for so long. I was wondering if anyone has been in a similar situation or has any advice. Were you able to overcome it on your own? ",18,2014-12-23 02:27:12 EST-0500
14,[Rant] I have to make a phonecall. I hate it. Writing this to gather some courage.,"I hate calling people. I'm just writing this to gather my courage. I hope they don't answer. It's an official call and although I don't technically have to do it right now, it has to be done, and I decided to do it today. If I don't I'm going to go around worrying about that every day until it's dealt with.

I really don't want to. I find myself thinking ""what is the worst the can happen if I ignore this?"" or ""could I ask someone else to do it for me?"". Making phone-calls is one of the most stressful things. I've learnt to call my friends, but that's about it. Despite this I wince everytime the phone rings, praying that it is only my mother calling to let of some steam.

Stop rambling. I need to make the call... I don't think I'm going to. But I have to. Gah, I hate this.

I'm just going to pick up the phone, dial the number without thinking. Once I've done that I can freak out. Not thinking is the key. Once I start thinking, I won't go through with it. Just do it. Start simple. Put in the number... done. don't click dial just yet... Remember to ask if they speak English (I have it when I don't know the language!) Introduce yourself, explain the situation and ask for a solution. That's it... Be brave. Be a someone else. Be a strong. Do it... now.

I did it. Such a relief. It went well and the guy was nice and easy to talk with, but now my heart is beating like crazy. It's weird, although I feel really relieved, I still feel anxious and sort of embarrassed. The way you do when you have made a fool out of yourself.

I wasn't going to post this first, but I thought you guys might appreciate this. Thanks for the help. :)",15,2014-12-22 13:52:39 EST-0500

16,"""I just wish you were normal.""","Today, the one person that I thought has actually accepted me, anxiety and all, said this to me... I feel so alone now. I really thought this person was there for me, and now I just feel so bad. If even they can't put up with my issues, how will anyone else be able to? I'm starting to lose hope that I'll ever be ""normal"" again.

Edit: For those saying that maybe they just mean they wanted me to be better for my own good-- Before saying this, this person had spent several minutes telling me how hard my anxiety is on him, how much he hates dealing with my issues all the time. It wasn't a good conversation, and this statement was yelled at me. As much as I hate to say it, he was only concerned with how unfair the situation is for him. ",8,2014-12-27 06:59:39 EST-0500

18,I[M]20 have regret or remorse for all my actions even ones that have no impact on life.,"Background, I come from an upper middle class family with possibly overly controlling parents. I have never had to fret about money unless it was something stupid and useless. I was an honors student in high school and now attend a state college in a fraternity and in a engineering field I have succeed well in college. Maintaining a 3.5+ GPA. My last relationship was over a year long and she was emotionally abusive. It was in high school, I am now a sophomore.

I can't help but feel anxious about everything I do. Something is always going to go wrong even though nothing ever does. From checking if something is locked 10 times to freaking out my close friends are mad at me and don't want to talk because I miss spell something. Things that obviously are just other people living there life's or things that won't change like a door being locked. 

I feel that everything I do will be taken wrong by everyone and they won't talk to me later or will be mad. That nothing I do is ever right, (my ex kinda beat(not literally) in to me she is always right). Everything I do I think is wrong and I should have done different or not at all. I have always said I think logically and act emotionally. I want to be my self and enjoy life but I am confined to thinking of my actions and their effect. Always bidding behind a wall of ""what will happen if"". 

I just want to enjoy my life and not hate it, like I do now :'(",6,2014-12-28 12:50:23 EST-0500

21,Watching Mr. Roger's Neighbourhood to relax!,"Hi all!  
  
Has anyone ever tried watching Mr. Roger's Neighbourhood to calm themselves down? 'Cause I have. And it works pretty well for me!  
  
His voice is very calming, as is the music, and his messages are quite therapeutic. I actually really like his messages. The audience is definitely children, but even the oldest person can take something away from them. Especially that of accepting yourself just as you are!  
  
The length of each episode and the availability is a plus as well (under 30 minutes, easily found on YouTube). You can choose a theme that is completely unrelated to whatever is causing your anxiety symptoms, or choose one that relates if you're trying to work things out.  
  
I frequently watch episodes to help me sleep and I am generally asleep 5-10 minutes in. I recommend doing this for anyone who prefers falling asleep to sound, though I'd stay away from the episode about quiet and noisy sounds for obvious reasons.. Learned that the hard way!    
  
[Here's an example to start you off.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AejN46S1VXQ)
  
Hopefully this is helpful for at least one person. Bye!",2,2014-12-23 09:09:11 EST-0500
22,I can't even get a job because of my fucking anxiety.,"I feel like I'm crazy. A prospective employer called me today. 4 years ago, I would have been the most polite and professional person, eager to pick up the phone and engage this person as an individual. Today, I've grown so bitter and depressed that I talked myself out of the job as soon as I saw the number come up. How? I realized that I'd have to meet this person, and as soon as I shook my cold, soaking-wet-with-sweat hand and saw the fear in my eyes (of people), they'd have no fucking reason to hire me. 

I can't do anything. I shake at the first sign of conflict. My heart starts racing and I can't catch a breathe. I start visibly shaking and stutter. I get awkward, shut down, and start sweating like I'd just run a mile. I'm also only 125 lbs (probably less now), so I look like a fucking crack addict when this happens.

How do I calm down? I'm pretty sure I'm beyond saving...my dad is a Christian minister and my mom is a zionist-charismatic-crazy person. Together, they royally fucked up my whole existence for the first 18 years of my life (in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ). Then, adopting some good morals and attempting to bring them with me into society-confidence=worst fucking idea ever. 

Anyways, I'm too much of a wimp to kill myself, so I need to fix this. Do I just need to make friends? Why would anyone want to be friends with a fucking crazy, sweaty, dumb-hipster douchebag? Why would I girl start to crush on a guy who is too afraid to shake someone's hand? Or go to the grocery store alone?",13,2014-12-24 09:13:24 EST-0500

34,"Intrusive thoughts, anyone else???","I actually have PTSD, but my most common symptoms are in the anxiety category.
Ever since my diagnosis, I have intrusive thoughts that happen only at night.
The thoughts are fears of me doing something unintentionally... like I'm afraid I'll sleepwalk and overdose on my medication, or sleepwalk and injure someone with a weapon, or do something completely out of my control. I've never sleepwalked before or witnessed anyone else doing it before, so I'm not sure of its basis.

I know it sounds insane. I'm terrified of hurting anyone to the point of being afraid to go to sleep because of it. Even though I have no rational basis for it, and I have never had thoughts of hurting anyone.

Anyone had something similar?

EDIT:
WOW, thank you everyone for the response. Didn't expect this to blow up so quickly.. It's actually a very late hour here, so I'm going to sleep..

Has anyone else struggled with this? If so what were some ways you fixed it? My girlfriend is all sad now because she thinks it is her fault.

38,DAE consistently find themselves incapable of trusting good news?,"I got good news yesterday. It was really, really good news actually, something I've known for almost two years might be coming, but I wasn't expecting it to happen right when it did. Everybody I told about it yesterday said, ""That's great! Congratulations! You deserve it!"" And reasonably, I know they're right.

It took me the better part of the afternoon yesterday to figure out why I wasn't excited or happy. I realized it was because I am deeply, deeply suspicious of it. I started to look back in my life and realized I've never gotten good news before, and times when I was really looking forward to something, it tended to get screwed up before I could enjoy it (for example, as a teenager I saved up enough money to go on a class trip to Greece, but four months before the trip my parents had to declare bankruptcy and I had to contribute all of that money to the household instead). Now I have this amazing thing that could mean an upturn in my life, and I can't enjoy it because I'm pretty sure it's going to go away.

Last night I had a really complicated and frustrating dream (I've been learning how to ""read"" my dreams in therapy) in which things I was looking forward to ended up going horribly wrong. I was at a sandwich shop, starving, and as the guy was making my sandwich a giant cockroach crawled over it. Later in the dream, I had to put on a dress for a dance competition but when a friend helped me into it, it ripped because it was too small. Then, when I did the dance competition, I did so badly that the club I was in banned the song I'd danced to forever. After the dance, the childhood love of my life approached me and wanted to hold hands, but when I tried I realized my hands were covered in sores.

I feel like one of two things is happening: my subconscious and my feelings are either telling me I can't trust this news, or my subconscious and my feelings are seriously screwed up and I need to just relax into it and enjoy it. When I really sit down and think logically about my good news, I don't see any realistic way that it will get screwed up. It might actually just be good news, plain and simple. I'm overthinking it.

And whenever I think about it I get an overwhelming rush of anxiety. Just writing this post has given me the shakes. Am I nuts?

Edited to add: I've been diagnosed with complex PTSD and suffered from depression for many years while in an abusive marriage. The good news is related to the divorce, which has been raging on for almost 2 years. So it's ""good news"" that's related to my abusive ex-husband, which adds a whole other layer of distrust and panic.",3,2014-03-26 21:14:47 EDT-0400

41,"[Help] [Rant] Having trouble with loud, sudden noises and shouting","I suffer from anxiety and depression and have never really vented some of my frustrations before so this is very new to me.

I grew up in a household where every day I was afraid of my parents coming home and the associated sounds: the sound of doors opening and closing, the sound of someone climbing stairs, shouting and screaming and the sound of slamming doors. You probably get the picture.

I often distracted myself with music whilst at home to drown out a lot of the noise, however I could still hear the occasional sound through the music. For several years since I had suffered from mild auditory ""hallucinations"", hearing screaming and shouting in the background of my favourite music despite being completely on my own, forcing me to remove my headphones like I used to each time. These experiences have faded in recent years as I have stopped listening to the music I enjoyed at the time. In addition, certain sounds can bring me straight to anxiety despite how relaxed I think I am, ranging from panic attacks to short, quick shocks.

6 years on and, although I've made progress with a lot of other areas of my anxiety, there are still certain sounds that stop me breathing and bring me to a heightened state of anxiety almost instantly. 

Most prominently these are:

* Doors - Knocking, slamming, opening and closing, locking and unlocking, if its a door it will make me feel uncomfortable unless I'm the only one with a key. Even then, only if I'm certain its locked do I feel secure.

* Stairs - The sound of boots on wooden stairs, although not common in my current environment, still causes me to panic and listen intently.

* Shouting/Raised voices - Anyone arguing or shouting within earshot, even if they are just being overly happy and its obvious they are joking around with friends. I guess this could be described as a part of social anxiety, but the distinct part is the sound of shouting in films/television. I can't stand it in any form and, occasionally, almost hurts my ears (its an intense sensation of pressure) forcing me to turn down or mute the source.

* Ringing Phones - The whole concept of a ringing phone can cause me to panic, even if it isn't mine. I begin to imagine the worst possible news waiting on the other side and often leave my phone on silent with the vibration off. Leaving only the visual indication of a call when I'm at my desk. If it's an unknown number and the caller ID is hidden I NEVER answer it. I also find the concept of answer phone messages hugely stressful to deal with.

Sorry for the ranting, I tried to structure it so at least it's easy to read. It's been very helpful to find somewhere to vent these frustrations. 

Today I was trying to attend an Optician's appointment and a fellow in the waiting room had a ringtone of screaming voices. He didn't manage to answer the phone in time and it rang several times before he could get it out of his pocket. He looked metal (long black hair and leather coat with studs) so I guess that's his thing but it set me off today and I haven't been able to relax since. It was a complete shock to me and I don't think I've ever heard something like it before, I wanted to just run out of the Optician's. I guess this is one of the reasons I felt the need to post this.

Feel free to post anything in the comments section, any advice or recounting similar experiences are welcome and appreciated.",8,2014-03-28 08:30:42 EDT-0400
42,"[Rant] Using Reddit/Tumblr feels very toxic, but my outlets are limited because of agoraphobia","I'm dealing with untreated agoraphobia, social anxiety, and depression, and I'm almost all alone in the world. I spend 24/7 at home, and when my SO is at work, I just sit... and do nothing. I've been using tumblr and reddit to interact with others and relieve boredom, but it feels like it's not really worth it. There's nowhere to go where people won't become vicious for sharing an opinion opposing their own. 

Whenever my little envelope turns red, my anxiety flares, my addrenaline jumps, and I have to timidly check and see if I've made myself some sort of pariah in whatever subreddit. And if it really is an unkind comment, it's kind of crushing. It sounds stupid, but when you're only interactions in life are online, they feel as real as face-to-face ones. I dunno.

Especially with reddit, there's no going back from that either. You can't apologise, nobody cares. And if you delete the comment, people will just talk about how you suck and are too wussy to deal with the backlash they ""brought on themselves.""

I guess I'm just broken up about it because I can't find a safe place online. Nothing feels like an environment I can speak in. On reddit and tumblr, you can't be yourself *and* liked, only one or the other.

52,My Guide to Conquering Anxiety,"I've been a lurker on this sub-reddit for a while and I have gotten so much help from stuff people have posted I decided I want to give back as much as i could. I am an 20yr old male in the US (I think this is bland enough for reddit's guidelines) and have been dealing with severe panic disorder,agoraphobia and depression for years now so i wanted to past down some tips I've learned over the years that have helped me stay calm, conquer panic attacks and overall empower myself to live my life without anxiety controlling it. 

Note I'm not a professional or anything like that, this all just simply my experience with it that I hope at least one person could get use out of.I tried to make it this make sense and as organized as possible, so I'm going to split it up into 3 big categories and I guess if you people want to ask me ANY questions regarding this feel free, I'll add like a FAQ section at the bottom for asked questions or might do an AMA corresponding with this post if popular enough.

 1* Preventing anxiety prior to an anxious situation  

 2* Preventing anxiety while being in an anxious situation 

 3* Calming down during / after a panic or anxiety attack

1* Ways To Reduce or Avoid Panic / Anxiety Before Being In An Anxious Situation

1) Prior Knowledge you NEED to know

-Some information that you need to know before you can get over anxiety / anxiety disorder is to know PANIC ATTACKS CAN NOT KILL YOU. Now some of you might be thinking ""no shit"" but when you are in the mix of a panic attack or feeling anxious what gives the anxiety control / power over you is fear! You are scared of feeling a certain way, passing out, or even dying. 

-You need to know that anxiety isn’t this separate being that has control over you, YOU give it its power, it doesn’t disappear due to circumstances or places, it is you controlling that, not the other way around. A perfect quote about this is ""Our deepest fear is that we are powerful beyond measure. It is our light, not our darkness, that most frightens us."" - Marianne Williamson. So you need to go into this knowing you have the power to control and change your anxiety, NOT your anxiety will control or change you.


2) Know Your Triggers

-You can’t prevent something if you don’t know when that something is going to happen. Most people should be aware of what triggers their anxiety, but if you don't know what your triggers are, think about being in different situations and see what ones make you anxious, and if multiple scenarios do, think about what similarities there are between those scenarios.

3) Write Down Your Goals, Do Something EVERYDAY & keep track of your progress!

-One of the biggest problems with having an anxiety disorder is that you will avoid scenarios that cause you anxiety cause you don’t want a panic attack (obviously lol) and that will most likely interfere with your day to day life and/or happiness. But one of the WORST things you can do is avoid those situations because you are giving power to the anxiety and letting that fear control you.

-So in order to get over anxiety you NEED to write (Yes i actually mean write, as in with a pen/pencil and on a piece of paper) your goal. (According to new research, people who write down their goals are 33% more likely to achieve them. Also writing is a GREAT stress relief) It doesn't matter the size of the goal, it can be something small or your BIG ultimate goal.

-But now you have your goal written down, the best way I learned how to make sure I keep making progress towards getting over anxiety / that goal and reducing the consequences if you have a setback is to keep a daily journal of what you do day to day towards that goal or in general how you handle anxiety. Make sure you write down how you felt, before, during and after you did an uncomfortable scenario. (I personally use the notepad app on iphone because of convenient it is, but if you want to write down your day to day stuff also that is encouraged.)

-Now I am telling you it WILL NOT BE a straight climb up. You WILL have set backs or not make as much progress as you did previous days, but the benefit of having that daily journal is you can look back on previous days and KNOW you were able to do it at one point and KNOW you can get back to that point or do that situation again. Also re reading your feelings does help you handle that similar situation A LOT better than if you don’t write it down and just try to remember 

4) Practice deep belly breathing!

-What often times brings on a panic attack and / or the symptoms of one is a lack of oxygen getting to your body which causes the dizziness, light headedness, sweat, shakes, rapid heartbeat etc. So in order to get rid of those symptoms is to simply breathe, but during that panic you are doing quick breathes that only make it worse.

-So to help you when you are in one of those situations is when you are in a calm environment to practice deep breathing. How I have been taught to deep breathe is to
        1- Sit up straight and put one hand flat on your belly and one hand flat on the middle of your chest, a bit below your collar bone. 
        2-Breathe in through your nose into your stomach (you should feel your stomach expand) for about 5-6 seconds.
        3- Hold it in for about 4-5 seconds.
        4- Then SLOWLY breathe out through your mouth for 8-10 seconds and feel your belly return to normal. Make sure you get all of your breathe out, so if necessary do a expel it through your mouth quickly in order to reset the process.
        5- Do this for about 2-3 minutes and you should feel calmer.

-After getting the gist of it you should be able to do it anywhere and it is the key to staying calm and keeping those uncomfortable symptoms at bay while also keeping your mind off of the panic and instead focusing fully on your breathing.

5) Think About What Makes You Angry and Find an Outlet

-You are probably thinking what I mean by this or ""But I'm not an angry person"". But I have learned from many professionals and people that have anxiety that the biggest cause of anxiety or stress that turns into anxiety; is your anger about somebody or something without even realizing it. When I was first told this or asked what made me angry I was confused because I rarely get angry over anything, but most of the time you can be angry about stuff and not even knowing it or be aware of it (a bit weird right?) So it goes sort of back to the triggers part, if you know what makes you angry being aware of it allows you to plan out how you can calm yourself down afterwards or avoid the situation entirely if you can. I personally listen to music or go for a walk as an outlet, but it could be anything writing ,reading, sports, running, photography, designing, video games etc.

-If you DONT know what triggers your anger or you're not even aware you are angry about anything you should still take time to find some sort of outlet you enjoy and give yourself some ""me time"" daily or weekly depending on what it is, preferably physical because it burns away stress hormones that create anxiety symptoms, tires your muscles, reducing excess energy and tension,release endorphins which improve overall mood, forces healthier breathing and It gives you such great benefits and helps take off the edge if you do get into a situation that makes you anxious.


2* Preventing anxiety while being in an anxious situation

1) Things You Can Tell Yourself
These are all things I have told myself to reduce anxiety or people who have anxiety have also told themselves to stay calm in an anxious situation or take away power from anxiety.

-Ask yourself 
""Is there a reason to believe something is wrong?""
""What proof is there that something is wrong?""
""Is there a chance I'm blowing this out of proportion?""
-""Okay, you're anxious. So what?"" 
-That you are fine and It Can't Hurt You [see 1) under 1*]
-Think of one of your happiest memories or imagine yourself in your personal happy place.
-Remember to Breathe!
-Observe small details of an object in your environment (color, texture, lighting etc)
-Distract yourself


2) Things You Can Physically DO and Specific Exercises
-The MOST successful exercise that I have been taught to INSTANTLY relieve anxiety is to 
Clench or Tighten EVERY part of your body you can think of while taking a breathe in then slowly release every tighten body part while exhaling. Make sure to Belly Breathe while doing this.

-Belly Breathe [see 4) under 1*]

-Chew Gum

-Clench your fists (or toes if you don’t want to be obvious) as hard as you can for 5 seconds and then slowly release them for 5 seconds.


3* Calming down during / after a panic or anxiety attack

1) Things You Can Tell Yourself
-Tell yourself to have a panic attack. I know this sounds weird since nobody wants to have one or experience anxiety, but from what I learned so much of what brings upon anxiety for me is feeling out of control and telling yourself to have a panic attack makes you in control, not anxiety. Every time I told myself to have a panic attack it never happened and calmed me down, so it is worth trying out and helps you gain confidence in yourself and your own ability to handle anxiety.

2) Things You Can Physically DO and Specific Exercises
-Clench your fists (or toes if you don’t want to be obvious) as hard as you can for 5 seconds and then slowly release them for 5 seconds and the other exercises I listed before. 

3) Allow yourself to feel proud 
-The reason this sub-reddit is as popular as it is because sadly not a lot of people understand anxiety unless they have first hand experience. This causes people to not fully understand the scale of something when you do it (not give into a panic attack, do something that usually gives you anxiety etc) so the most valuable lesson I learned is to look only at yourself for approval and not expect others to give you validation. 

That's it, again as I said feel free to ask me any questions and I will help you as much as I can. :) ",20,2014-07-27 22:26:24 EDT-0400

56,Someone at work yesterday went to see me to say she enjoyed working with me.,"I work at a craft store- and I love it. Most of the time (some customers can be mean, not all, but some. And all the people I work with are really nice)
On Tuesdays we get our trucks of restocks so we have to unpack all the boxes. I usually can't work Tuesdays because I have police explorers but my manager has had me work during the days so I was able to this week. It was my first time working in the back. I've been here for four months but am usually a the registers or putting stuff back. I wasn't familiar with where to put things in the back so one other employee (well call her A) told me to just ask her so nothing would get misplaced. A is really cool, some might think she's ""scary"" but she's just got a really good sense of humor and as others say ""is honest.""

Well, that was on Tuesday. I worked again yesterday but only at the registers. A went over to me while I was waiting for the manager to get my register ready. She said she wanted to tell me she really liked working with me, she never heard me talk and I guess I talked a lot on Tuesday and made her laugh. She said I wasn't afraid to ask questions for where things went. I also told a few people back there about some interesting or annoying customers I had- which made a few laugh. Typically I have a hard time asking questions and talking, but I did better on Tuesday so much to where A thought it was awesome (and shocking) that I can actually talk.

57,I can't sleep because my mind keeps racing. Anyone else have this problem?,"Whenever I try to sleep, I end up playing out scenarios in my mind. Stuff like, ""What would happen if I were to do this?"". I think about what I would say, what would happen, etc. This keeps me awake, and for some reason I can't stop thinking about whatever my mind decides to focus on. My mind never gets tired. If I have nothing to think about, my mind makes stuff to think about. The sleep deprivation makes my anxiety really bad. I take 100 mg of Benadryl when things get really dire, but it makes me feel like crap in the morning. By the way, don't drink 4 cups of coffee on a Benadryl hangover, especially when you have an anxiety disorder. I found that out the hard way today.

I love how I'm comfortable reaching out. I do my best to help people when I can. I also love the fact that I'm small and am not afraid of a good challenge. I like to face it than flee it. It took years of gaining my confidence to just even be able to walk outside and pass people not caring about what they think of me. I'm doing a lot better at it. The only thing I still get anxious about is people close to me and I'm always worried that things are doomed to fail or when something small and even irrelevant goes wrong, that something bad will happen. I've been doing okay at thinking it through and focus on the good things because even if bad things happen, I want to be strong. I still cry here and there and my mind race, my heart race, I feel like curling up in fetal position but I know all these negative feels won't last forever. At least, I'm fighting so it won't.

62,About to have a severe anxiety attack at work.,"If you look thru my past youll know why I am so usually all the time anxious, and its just a matter of suppression/repression/distraction (basically im doing thru a really emotionally destroying break up where I gave my all to a girl I loved and also had borderline personality disorder, and brain cancer and in the end she basically told me she never loved me as much as i loved her and shes moved on and happy because i wasnt enough)

But now on top of all that my only true friend is going thru so much she told me ""im sorry but I cant handle your problems right now, I care, i really do but I am handling too much  right now""

Ive never felt more alone. Everyone in my life has let me down and as long as I had my ex (before all this) and my best friend I was fine. I could always rely on them to understand me and atleast let me vent a little. 

But now... My ex and i will never talk again. I would of died for her at one point, I gave her my everything and was ready to take my next step in life with her. And now? Ive never been further from someone and its absolutely crushing. 

My best friend, I cant be mad at her. She is going thru her own anxiety and depression and just cant handle more stress. doesnt mean it leave me alone.

I cant do this. I dont know if i can breath thru this one. My nails are already digging into my palms. I can feel them tingling. I always lose feelings in my hands during these things. My breathing is getting faster. this cant fuckin happen.",12,2014-07-24 17:30:30 EDT-0400

67,Could really use some help Reddit :(,"Hi there guys, I really have no idea on where to begin.

My name is Josh, i'm 23 and have no idea what i am doing with myself. I know so far this doesn't sound like an anxiety issue, but i'll explain further on.

I work part-time at a local supermarket. I don't particularly enjoy it, but who would. I have always been anxious, but it's only progressed on worse. I can't even leave the house without feeling incredibly nervous. I tend to mumble 24/7, which makes everything a whole lot worse. 

My ex girlfriend has recently broken up with me, because of all this fucking issues that are taking place. I don't blame her at all. I don't mean to sound like i'm grieving attention or anything, but it's true. Who would want to be somebody that has no direction in their life?. I do miss her like crazy though. There's no way we're getting back together though. She's dating somebody else. 

I'm the jealous type and often paranoid over silly things. This also contributed to the breakup. 

Ok, i know this story has no structure at all, which i do apologize. That would be my poor English grammar and punctuation. I don't possess any skills. When i was in school i had no drive. I came out with pretty much nothing, and was told by 'friends' that i wouldn't amount to much. Over the years i have developed an interest towards computers. The only thing that is keeping me sane is this interest. I have always pictured myself developing software and having a solid understanding of open source operating systems. 

But at the rate I'm going at the moment, it's gonna take a very long time to achieve this. I can't seem to focus on one thing at a time. I go through phases; i.e writing a daily routine. This would only last for about a week though, before falling back into this hole.

I'm always feeling overwhelmed. And have often had thoughts about just ending life. I'm stronger then/than?(don't even know which to use...) though. It just passes my mind every so often. It just seems like an easy option then putting up with this shit. 

Please help me :(

69,"Things are going well, but I'm constantly thinking of running away and starting fresh, but terrified of what could happen [Help]","I thought I'd post this here as r/anxiety have proven very supportive and friendly in other posts. But it is pretty scary for me to write this here.


Some background about me. Turning 30 soon. I've got a good job, I'm doing something I enjoy and it pays well. I have a girlfriend, she is a nice and we've been together nearly 5 years, she is supportive but doesn't understand me. I have friends who I hang out with, but I have social anxiety so I feel more comfortable hiding at home. I'm rather heavily medicated for anxiety and depression, but I've been stable for a while so I've been doing ok in this regard.


If i think rationally, my life is going rather well considering these medical issues. But inside me, it may sound childish, but I have an inner desire to just run away. I guess we're always told to go to school, get a job, get married, have kids, retire and then die. There is nothing wrong with that, but I feel trapped and uncomfortable with the way things are in my life and where they are going. I feel as if running away I could leave behind all my inter conflict and finally relax, where I can be myself and find comfort.


On the other hand though, starting fresh is scary, especially with general anxiety and social anxiety, how would I cope? I'm not so bad that I couldn't function, but I spent so long getting through dark times as a teenager/early 20s, that I'm scared to go back to that place. 


I believe I should follow my desires, but on the other hand, facing my fears and throwing everything away is terrifying. Has anyone here been through something similar?


Edit 1: Thanks for your responses. I definitely feel better and have definitely got some things to think about- I'm actually kind of excited at the fact that I have something to work towards, like the light at the end of the tunnel. :)",14,2014-07-26 13:57:50 EDT-0400
70,Overthinking and overanalysing has wrecked me.,"I hate being alone with my thoughts...

My mind always has to drown me in a torrent of negative thoughts whenever someone happens to me, good or bad. For example, when someone compliments me, or makes me feel like a good person, I'll feel euphoric for a while, but then my mind starts to say things like ""Did he/she really mean that?"" or ""Are they just mocking me for some amusement?""

I know that they really do mean it because they're very nice people, but my subconscious keeps trying to convince me that they do not mean it, and that they cannot stand me. This starts to make me feel inferior towards that person, therefore triggering anxiety.

If anyone has any tricks to stop my habit of overthinking and overanalysing, please share them in the comments, because this is really getting me down, and I'm worried that close friendships could end if this carries on.

Thanks for showing some concern, and if anyone else suffers from constantly overthinking negative things, you are not alone! ",5,2014-07-23 01:41:41 EDT-0400

and then I noticed that the feeling of doing that was just like the (rare) feeling when I manage to be assertive about my needs/desires at someone else.

But I grew up, and out, of most of that. However, some of it still lingers from.time to time. My wife is.very social, prefers to be right in the center of the action while I'm the quiet lurker. We just moved to a new state, where she's from, and she's having a handful of friends over Saturday. She organized it, then I read about them all talking about it on Facebook. I have nothing to add to the conversation, so immediately feel like an outsider, and these feelings and warning signals of rejection, anxiety, etc., kick in. It feels so childish but I can't control it. I end up trying to discuss it with my wife, and she gets angry because it's been an ongoing issue for years, every time.there is a social situation that. I didn't organize or control I have some issue, and can't manage it properly.

I take xanax, which helps but makes me tired. I just want it to stop.

When it coes to being social, I'm fine. I like people, can approach and conversate well, can seem reallly outgoing and make people laugh.

Last year in college, I was extremely depressed. I was extremely lonely. I was so depressed that I couldn't attend most classes. I would wake up really, really late. I woke up at 4 PM once. Yeah, not my best days. Anyways, final exams were coming up in the next few weeks, and I barely knew any of the material. I downloaded all the powerpoints and did everything I could to study for each and every exam.

And by the time the exams came around. I just didn't go. I skipped the exams. I just gave up. I threw out all my powerpoints, notes, lab papers the night before each exam, and I didn't go to the exams. Apparently I'd rather get a 0 and no worries about exams than work that hard and get a bad grade. That probably isn't the first time that happened to me. I just don't remember whether it happened before.

My anxiety caused me to not have friends, not being able to work, and caused me to cut my parents out of my life. I'm not suicidal but I do feel like I'm taking up space and that I'm pretty much useless since I can't do 'normal' things. ",8,2014-05-11 04:19:43 EDT-0400

80,"I developed a panic disorder after a drug trip gone wrong. Over a year later, I think I am fully healed. Here is my story.","Pretext: I apologize for the length of this post. It is my story as I am finally able to tell it, and my hope is that it may contain some insights for those in similar situations. As an aside, I do mention my experiences with recreational drugs, but I am certainly not advocating them as a way of treating mental health issues. If you're trying to self medicate, stop first and get professional help, even if you think you're above it. It may not be the answer, but it should be your first stop. Moving on!

I have never been formally diagnosed with anxiety, yet I can remember the first day it gripped me twenty years ago. I was in first grade, and my teacher had given us a writing assignment. Rather than turn it in to be graded once complete, she instead instructed the whole class to line up at her desk and take turns being graded on the spot--and in front of everyone. If you did well, you'd even get an animal cracker as a reward. Nice!

Now, up until then I'd lived a pretty carefree existence on my family's farm. I had some friends, I was curious and intelligent, and I was sensitive... very sensitive. I was so senitive that I could not even fathom the level of shame I would feel when I finally reached my teacher's desk and watched her mark up my assignment with a red pen. Misspellings, improper punctuation, a run on, and more. ""No cracker,"" she loudly proclaimed. Whether or not I was the only one who noticed, everyone got a cracker but me. I had never felt so terrible in my life. I had never known such humiliation. All I can remember was going back to my desk to put my head down and never wanting to lift it again.

The incident was soon forgotten about and stored in the back of my mind, but it was the beginning of my troubles. From that point on, despite a loving family and supportive friends, I did my best to hide a number of worsening issues that I felt I would not be able to overcome.  I had body image problems, I wasn't good at anything, and I didn't feel like I belonged anywhere. 

My self esteem dropped along with my grades. I was reprimanded for my poor performance in school, which only worsened my mental state. But, because I found so much joy and solace in my hobbies (mostly gaming), no one stopped to consider that I might be seriously depressed or anxious. Instead, I was told that I was undisciplined and lazy and wasting my potential. It was a speech I grew so frustrated with that, as I grew into a teenager, it fueled a rebellious streak that landed me in detention a lot and caused my grades sink to failing levels.

I never knew that the way I felt wasn't normal. I had no way of knowing. To me, it was my bitter reality that I had to overcome by sheer force of will. I was simply lazy, and my problems were all clearly within my control according to every adult in my life.
So, with a lot of last minute tutoring, I BARELY graduated from high school and took a year to work full time before pursuing college. The anxiety go better, but my insecurity grew worse. Shortly after being accepted to Rutgers, my girlfriend left me for someone else. Now more than ever, I felt worthless. I faired alright in college, but again, was seen as an underperformer and a waste of potential. The pattern continued to repeat itself. I recognized it, and vowed to change my ways.

I became, at this time, obsessed with self improvement. I began working out, eating better, buying nicer clothes, and doing everything I could to feel attractive. But I still couldn't shake this feeling of being inferior to everyone around me. I tried more and more to be someone, and changed a lot as a result. I'm ashamed to admit that I became very douchie around this time. I often overcompensated at the expense of others, and I broke some hearts.

Though I hadn't lost my innate sensitivity, I was now suppressing my emotions because I had FUCKING HAD ENOUGH already and didn't want to feel this way anymore. I became very judgmental, and feigned a sense of elitism to compensate for how I really felt at the time. Bear in mind, these were not conscious decisions... they were simply my reactions to how I felt at the time. 

Now, is where things really start moving to my nervous breakdown. Toward the end of college, I decided to try smoking weed for the first time. I hiked a mountain with my friends, set up camp, and eagerly sucked on a joint and waited to see what it would feel like. But it didn't feel good. I felt distant, inconsequential, and the world felt unreal. I told my friends that I felt as though I was looking at reality through a window I couldn't open. I didn't know it at the time, but I was derealizing and depersonalizing without panicking. They thought I was being funny. They laughed. I got real quiet.

Months passed, and I smoked on occassion. Around the time I graduated, still unaware that there was something BEYOND my control that was causing my unhappiness, I decided to try eating some mushrooms with a friend. The experience was magical. I felt a sense of euphoria and oneness I'd never known. It opened up ways of thinking I'd never even considered and gave me a beautiful sense of perspective about the universe and life.

Over the next two years, I tripped multiple times on acid and mushrooms, each trip helping me reconnect with the emotions I had chained up around the time I got to college. But every answer I found in my mental adventuring brought up new questions, and I was desperate to find something definitive and true about existence that would help me feel like I belonged on this planet. In otherwords, I sought a sense of kindredship and community I had never known. So I made the reckless decision one day to take six hits of acid, twice what I had ever experienced, and travel down the rabbit hole to look for answers.

I don't need to tell you that this was a terrible idea. I could write books on that acid trip. It was so beyond comprehension, reality was so bent, synesthesia was so eminent, and my ability to comprehend even my own thoughts was destroyed. While reality melted and reconfigured around me and every understanding of what I was doing vanished, I experienced my first full blown panic attack. I completely lost control, derealized, and for the first time in my life, felt sheer terror. It's not a good thing when you feel terror on a drug that can make anything seem real. I only wish that it had left me merely terrified. 

Before I knew it, I felt that I had made a terrible mistake and succumbed to a crippling sense of shame that brought me to my knees. The same kind of shame I felt when I didn't turn in homework, got detention, was rejected by a girl I liked (it had happened a lot), and was refused an animal cracker for my shitty spelling when I was seven. Only, it was amplified to such cosmic levels of shame that must be reserved for the likes of Judas. The experience left me in tatters. I still (STILL!) didn't understand what had happened even after I came down a couple hours later. I thought, ""so that's what a bad trip is like. I'll do less next time."" Sigh.

I spoke to many people about the experience. No one could help. No one had insight. No one understood just how traumatic the numbness of a true panic attack feels when it grips you by the spine with its icy fingers. I couldn't stop thinking about it, almost masochistic in my attempts to reconstruct what happened on that trip and make sense of it, determiend never to feel that way I did when I first felt the cortisol and adrenaline dump into my bloodstream all at once. But for the time being, I felt safe as long as I wasn't on any sort of drug.
I wrote down what insights I could glean from the experience and tried to move on. But less than a year later, I was hired at a job that proved to be incredibly toxic. A friend of a friend needed someone with marketing experience to help their car dealership move into the 21st century, and I needed the money, so I took it. 

Everything you think is true about car dealerships most likely is. I was dropped into a shark tank of coked up used car dealers and a boss who thought he was John Gotti. He actually got off to making grown men cry in his office and preferred to rule by fear. He would at one point cut salaries and fire a few employees so he could purchase a $300,000 Bentley, by the way. I've worked many jobs in my life and enjoyed most of them. I cannot overstate how terrible this place was.

Anyway, they tend to hire people with similar skillsets so they always have an option to cut dead weight. This creates an environment of extreme distrust as everyone always feels like their job is constantly on the line. My stress grew so bad, that I was pushed to the brink. One day, during a fiery company meeting where the boss was shouting in people's faces, I went over the edge. ",48,2014-05-09 20:59:40 EDT-0400

He said, and I quote, ""You were told by a doctor that you have a psychological problem and you believed him, and now it's stuck in your mind that you have a problem""

91,Sex overload with SSRI. I'm freaking out.,"29/M here. I'm currently on my third day of taking Celexa (citalopram) at 5mg and so far it hasn't been too bad. This is my second SSRI after taking Zoloft (couldn't handle the side-effects after the second day).

For both of these SSRI's, getting an erection was a little bit longer, but nothing out of the ordinary.

Anyways, Celexa adjusting to my system hasn't been too painful compared to the Zoloft. I feel as if I'm already used to it after just three days... Which is why I was surprised at what happened during sex.

Once I got fully turned-on/excited, my chest and back of the head starts feeling VERY cold... Almost like a tingly/electric. It's so overwhelming I feel like I'm going into shock. The same thing happened while I was taking Zoloft as well.

It's sort of like this: the Celexa/Zoloft was trying to prevent me from getting horny (like a shield), but once I got fully aroused, I ""broke"" the shield (with my dopamine levels?) and the cold feeling in my chest and head started overflowing.

(Edit): Now that I think about it, it might have been a panic attack. 

What's going on? This never happened when I was not on SSRI's. Many SSRI users complain about arousal issues, but my problem is that I can't continue because I feel like I'm about to die of a heart attack.

I can't blame Celexa because this happened with Zoloft too. It's as if I'm unable to become excited or horny unless I want another panic attack. I also have a strong feeling that if I were to have working out at the gym (in lieu of having sexy time), I would have had the same symptoms! 

Thoughts?

95,Found out my source of anxiety!,"Hello everyone, 

I found out my source of anxiety this morning. This may or may not help you but I really hope it does. Anyway so my problem comes from trying to control, and the idea of losing control or not being in control causes me a ton of anxiety. I have to learn to simply surrender and not be in control. This article is very helpful right here and I urge you to read it if you feel you have problems with control. 

http://tinybuddha.com/blog/let-go-of-control-how-to-learn-the-art-of-surrender/

Now, for me specifically I have quite a problem. I just have the idea that I am inferior to everyone. I've worked on this with my psychologist and he taught me otherwise. Now what I had to do is sort of practice replacing the old idea that I was inferior that I've had for like most of my life with the new idea that I'm average. The thing is though this has caused me unbearable amounts of anxiety. Why? Because I tried to control my feelings. I tried to make sure I wouldn't be depressed again by continuously repeating that new idea in my head. It was very stressful and I've always been like this. I've always tried to hide the insecurity in me of being inferior by using things like: beating friends in video games, doing very well in school, etc. But none of it actually worked and just caused me so much anxiety. I know now what I have to do but it feels like trying to control how I feel causes me so much anxiety that I just want to surrender to the feeling of inferiority. (Which by the way, came from the idea that people with Learning Disabilities are inferior, therefore I am inferior because I have one. He corrected it by telling me people with LDs are average like everyone else they are just characterized by having a high strength in one area and low one in another and they're not to be confused with developmental disabilities.) 

So my question to everyone is: How can I sort of just let go and stop trying to control my feelings? It feels like trying to change my automatic thoughts was an even bigger push to trying to control my feelings. How can I just accept it that I feel inferior and not try so hard to control it but instead work on it progressively? 

Thanks!

96,To The People Who Stare,"This is an open letter to all the people who stare at me when I'm having a panic attack, or tease me, mock me, tell me to stop faking, etc.

To the people who stare.
First off, screw you. 
Second, this isn't fun. It's painful.
Third, call me an attention whore one more time, I dare you. You say you know I'm faking? I say you must have a PhD, would you like to show me credentials from your alma mater? 
Fourth, it is ""that bad."" The tears streaming from my eyes and shrieking hyperventilation are not my decision, nor is it yours as to whether or not this hurts.
Fifth, I know it's loud. I'm trying to stop it, and telling me to shut up does not help.
Sixth, I offend you with my panic? I'm sorry, I didn't realize I was shutting down all of YOUR rational brain function, turning YOUR stomach inside out, rolling YOUR eyes back in your head, stabbing YOUR head with sharp, sudden pains, tensing every muscle in YOUR body, stopping YOU from breathing, or pulling tears from from your eyes with the tiny anchors of my own malevolence towards your comfort. If it offends you that much, walk away. I don't need you.
Seventh, I am not pathetic. You are. My brain may have a few short circuits, but at least it's not so impaired as to think I'm important enough to judge someone else's issues, and tell them how to fix it.
Eighth, I'm not perfect. I don't need you to tell me that. I'm doing the best I can.
Ninth, I will go farther than you. Panic disorder is a living hell, and it has forged me in fire day in, and day out. I've had this since I was two, honey boo, you are nothing new.
Tenth, next time you get hurt or scared, maybe you'll understand. This is how my brain is wired, and I know it's strange.
Eleventh, learn from me instead of judging. If you can learn to see the person I am through my panic, you can do a lot of things. I know it's tough to look past sometimes, maybe even a lot of times, but please, take me as an opportunity to see that there is always far more than meets the eye.

98,"The difference between the people who think that they get it, and the ones who actually do. [Long, but my first post and a huge step for me]","I am a sixteen year old female struggling with panic disorder and chronic anxiety. I managed in silence for my whole life with these attacks, and until two months ago, I never told anyone. Not my friends, nor my parents and family. The only person who knew was my SO; let's call him ""G.""
  G was the most supportive understanding person that I had had the pleasure to know. He got it, he understood what I was going through and helped through multiple attacks.
  One night, about 3 or so months ago, I was on the phone with G and I had a severe panic attack that I probably should have gotten brought to the hospital, G ended up with him telling his mom about everything, and I was okay with that. Soon after, I was urged to get therapy. That was a problem. That meant I had to tell my parents.
  Now, I love my parents, but they are very different from me; in the way they think, their values, and opinions. Quite frankly, I find them to be extremely hypocritical people, as my mother detests her mom for the exact same thing. 
  So one night, I approach them, and I tell them everything. I would have expected them to be understanding and supportive, but that's not exactly what happened. They didn't want to take me to therapy or the doctor. It took a lot of talking and stress before they finally agreed, and I got an appointment. I am now in therapy and taking a daily SSRI.
  Now skip forward to this past weekend. I had the worst panic attack I had ever experienced, I accidentally woke up my parents and my mom came in to find me cover in tear and my knee covered in my own blood from me gouging out the skin with my fingernails. I initially thought that she would try to comfort me or something, but no. She stood in my room, with her arms crossed, starring me down. She told me to calm down, but in such away that it just made me panic more. After eventually I calmed down, she looked at me and the gist of what she told me was that I was selfish and not thinking of anyone bit myself during these attacks. I was and still am shocked. She told me that she had always had panic attacks and that I Had no reason to be upset. I know that she has never had a panic attack, even if she thinks that she had. I know because if she had had one, she would have known that she was only making the attack worse. I hate her for this. I know that it is a terrible thing to say, but unfortunately it's true. She has this delusion that she gets it, but she doesn't. She is just switching around the situation to make herself the victim, like she always does.
  Now I bring you to yesterday. G does martial arts, and it helped him enormously when he was going through a hard time, so I went to his class. I had been anxious from the moment that I decided to do it. He comforted me and promised me that everything would be fine, and that it would help.
  We get to the studio and I am shaking uncontrollably and hyperventilating. We walk inside, and though I had been to the studio to watch a class before, it was everything was surreal; nothing looked right to me and I was dizzy. I turned and started to walk back outside, it was too much. G stopped me and held my hand as and I slowly turned and walk back into the waiting area of the studio. I was greeted by a female instructor who worked at the studio who I had met once before, we'll call her S. S could immediately tell that I wasn't doing well. I was now really beginning to have a full on attack, but she came right up next to me and told me that everything would be fine and smiled. She told me that she would get me a gi so that I would feel less out of place and more comfortable. I remember that I just kept apologizing, but she told that it was completely okay and to not be sorry; that that was what she was there for. She had at this point calmed me down significantly, and we entered the class together and she taught me the respect traditions (eg. Bowing) and S, G, and I were in a line in the back of the studio. 
  I eventually did calm down almost completely and was beginning to really enjoy the class. By the end, I was positive that I wanted to come back. 
  On the way home with G, one realization hit me: and almost complete stranger to me was able to calm me down and prevent a panic attack, when my own mother only made it worse and told me that I was selfish and that it was my own fault. 
  I supposed that that is the real difference between someone who thinks that they understand someone with anxiety or panic, and someone who actually does.

105,"spoke in front of 2,000 people on monday","ive been diagnosed with depression, anxiety disorder, and ocd since my teen years and the past 10 or so years have been sort of a mess. i hated high school and couldnt deal with people or deadlines or anything of that sort. college i became a bit social and admittedly was fairly attractive so i was able to attract women and the like but i always fucked it up by being too anxious and nervous they didnt like me or would cheat on me.  thats been a common theme. 

throughout my first three years of college i dealt with stress by exercising and hanging out with friends, but then after a break up and medical problems two summers ago i sort of had a break down. i got on zoloft and gained about 60 pounds from dealing with my anxiety by only studying and drinking/eating heavily with friends.  got a great GPA but fucked up pretty much everything else in life despite landing a good internship. i have since gone of the zoloft and have dropped about 20 lbs of fat from rigorous exercising. 

this internship ended up getting me a fairly high profile job in a high profile political city. it turns out this kind of job is not the best for people with crippling social anxiety.  meeting with ceo's, politicians, and community leaders on a fairly regular basis has my stomach constantly in knots and my nerves on fire.  only problem is i am very good at faking it and being good at socializing is the only marketable skill i have.

still it fucking terrifies me. i was scheduled to speak at one of the more high profile, televised MLK events in the city on monday.  i see a shitty 22 yr old kid who barely knows how to do anything sometimes when i look in the mirror but someitmes i get these brief, extreme flashes of confidence and can do some cool things.

so i was terrified and nervous and wanted an asteroid to hit the convention center but i got up to the stage and was easily the youngest speaker by thiry years and it was in front of several congressman, the governor, and other politicians and community figures.

i was told i nailed it, and got a pretty big applause. 

i think people should realize that anxiety and depression effect a LOT of people and ""extroverts"" can have it too. i can get up on a stage or lead a conference room in a discussion of things that i have written down and casually rehearsed, but if you asked me how i genuinely felt about something or any of my worries, fears, etc i woudnt be able to get a sentence out. 

people are often fighting battles you cant see.  one of my best friends in the world found out i have been battling depression and anxiety only a few months ago and he was literally shocked. 

im still real happy i was able to get up there and talk despite being terrified. if only i could learn how to talk to women or not worry about my job constantly.

123,[Rant] I can no longer live my life normally,"At the moment I am feeling some terrible anxiety, which I experience almost everyday. I feel like I'm dying.

This time last year I thought I was going to just get better, as it turns out I'm worse off than I ever was. Friday I could barely get through my classes, I had an anxiety attack through my entire first class, could not focus or care about anything during my second class (because I was in anxiety attack recovery mode) and by the time my third class was over I had basically been experiencing anxiety nonstop for 5 hours and went home and crashed. All weekend I have been hiding but tomorrow I have to go to classes again. It's such a normal thing for most people, but it fills me with dread.

I feel confused so often. I get an anxiety attack when I do something stupid like forget someone's name or forget that I already made coffee because I'm sure it's a symptom of a brain tumor, or otherwise a symptom that I'm dying. Little things that happen everyday like dropping your keys or getting dizzy after standing up, have me convinced I am dying, and I live everyday like it's my last (not in the philosophical way) and I can't live like this anymore. I'm constantly saying goodbye to my mom and my friends in my head. It's so frustrating and painful. 

I can't concentrate on any written words on a page. I try to do the work that interests me, and I try to engage in my studies that I have looked forward to my whole life, but the words just look so flat and meaningless. If I don't get control over this I'm going to flunk out.

I want so badly to live life and see the world as I did when I was a child. I thought I would turn out so differently. Now it's like there's this big wall between me and life. I can appreciate all the awesomeness in the world, I can logically perceive myself in it and how fortunate I am, I have all the means to be happy, but it's like this: you're craving a delicious slice of chocolate cake, you want it more than anything, and there's a piece that is literally right in front of you, but everytime you take a bite, you don't taste anything, and you don't understand why. I want to taste things and feel things again.

I made a second appointment with a therapist, the first appointment I didn't divulge most of the most consuming aspects of my everyday struggles. I was too anxious to be open with him. But now I feel like I need to be completely honest with him so he can fix me. I used to tell myself I would never go on meds, but now I would take anything if it would just make this anxiety disorder go away.

I don't know if this is the right place for this, but keeping all my anxiety inside all the time, day after day, is making me go insane. If anxiety was a voice in your head, then mine is getting unbearably loud, it's screaming at me and I feel hopeless 24/7.

131,"Tips on improving your life: Reduce anxiety, stress, depression, etc.","Hi everyone-

I've been a long time lurker of this great website, and I finally decided to make an account today because I feel like I have something useful I can share with you all.  If even one of your lives is changed for the better by my post, I'll feel like it was worth my time to write this out.  

So, before I get to the list of tips, I just want to preface it with a short story about myself.  I had been struggling with stress, social anxiety and depression for a while before this, and it got to a point where I was actually thinking of talking to my parents about it and seeing if I could find some meds that might help me.  Before it got to that though, I decided on doing some research on various topics which might help me with my anxiety.  There is a lot of great information that I came across (which I will mention later), that helped me deal with my problems.  

I think the first step we need to take to improve our lives is to become conscious of what we say to ourselves every day.  A lot of us don't love ourselves like we should.  We call ourselves nasty things because we make even the simplest of mistakes.  We do something embarrassing, and we'll beat ourselves up for it for the longest time.  Things on TV and advertisements are constantly telling us that we aren't good enough and that we're too ugly or not skinny enough.  

I finally decided that I was sick and tired of always feeling shitty about everything in my life, and I learned that all you have to do is change the way you look at the world.  I was just going to opt for the quick fix of drugs, which mask the problems, but don't deal with the root of it all.  I feel like this is becoming a major problem in the world.  We all have these problems in our lives, so we go get some drugs so we don't have to deal with our feelings.  If you are feeling shitty, it's because there is something wrong with the way you are seeing the world and thinking about things.  

I know there are some people who actually do have serious problems such as severe anxiety and depression, and some of those people do need medication to help, but I think a huge number of people diagnosed with depression, anxiety, and a number of other problems don't need to be on meds, and if they can just take the time and effort to better their lives, they can do it.  

I wish I could say this is an easy process, but it isn't.  It took me a long time to find the right information, and practice the things I will outline below.  There were a lot of other techniques that I tried, and they didn't work for me, so please take note that some things will work for you while others will not.  You have to find your own way which is effective for you.  

Sorry for dragging out the intro for so long.  Without further adieu, here are the tips that I have found along my journey which i personally think will improve your life if followed:

Tips on Improving your Life:

#1 - Become conscious of your thoughts.

- What are you saying to yourself each day?  Are you constantly criticizing yourself for your mistakes? Are you generally a positive or a negative person?

#2 - Practice positive thinking.

- Now that you've realized how you are talking to yourself, it's time to change it to a way that will benefit you.  Every time a negative thought comes into your head stop it!  One way to do this would be to keep a rubber band on your wrist, and snap it every time you have a bad thought.  this way, your brain will equate negative thoughts with pain, and will reduce the amount of negative thoughts you create.  Keep practicing consciously thinking positively.  For a person who is stuck in a pattern of negative thoughts (like i used to be), this will be really hard at first!  Don't give up!  The more you consciously create positive thoughts, the easier it will get.  I would say that if you work hard at this for about a month, it will become a habit, and you will naturally become a positive person.
Meditation is also another great way of quieting your mind, and will help you with controlling your thoughts.

#3 - Ask yourself the right questions.

- This goes off of tip #2 a bit, but listen to the kinds of questions you are asking yourself.  When you make a mistake, are you asking yourself:  a) why am I so stupid?  or  b) What can I do that will help me to avoid this problem in the future?  Try to start asking yourself more questions like choice b).  When we ask ourselves questions, our minds try so hard to find answers, even to questions that don't have right answers.  We might as well be asking ourselves productive questions that will help us improve ourselves.

#4 - Love yourself no matter what.

- I think this is one of the things that helped me the most.  I used to hate the person that I was.  Whenever I could, I told myself these 6 golden words:  ""I love myself no matter what.""  At first I didn't believe it, but I kept telling myself those words, and eventually, I did believe them.  Just like with the positive thinking, I think it takes up to a month of these affirmations to really get the full effect, but I guarantee you will start feeling better within the first week of doing this!  Once i finally started to believe what I was telling myself, I felt much happier because I didn't need other people's acceptance or love; I loved myself already.  For that reason, I also reduced my anxiety greatly because i wasn't worried about how other people thought of me because I already accepted myself.  Through this one tip, I became a happier, less anxious, and more confident person.

#5 - Be grateful (don't complain or talk negatively about others)
 
- Try to take a moment out of your day to just reflect on the things that you are grateful for.  We live in a beautiful world with wonderful people who love and care about us.  If we are complaining or bad-mouthing others, we are not being grateful.  If you have 5 minutes, watch this video: 
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Zl9puhwiyw&feature=youtube_gdata_player 

#6 - Work on improving yourself each day.

- There is always room for improvement.  look for ways you can improve your knowledge and skills.  Know that you will be a greater version of yourself tomorrow and the following days ahead. 

#7 - Read and educate yourself.

- Make it a habit to start reading books.  Find a good story or read about topics that interest you.  Novels are great, but I would recommend doing a lot of your reading on non-fiction books.  I personally love learning about psychology and reading how our brains work, but like i said, find subjects that don't bore you.  Self help books also provide great information on bettering your life.  I highly recommend reading ""7 Habit's of Highly Effective People"".  It has a bunch of relevant info, some of which I have used in this list.  
There are also a lot of great educational videos out there.  I would suggest starting with these:  

- Vice TV:  www.youtube.com/vice

     - Lots of interesting documentaries and videos on here.

-TED Talks:  https://new.ted.com/talks

     - A site filled with a bunch of great talks on various subjects

- Diving Deep (Infinite Waters):  www.youtube.com/Kemetprince1

     - Just a guy's youtube channel, but he has a lot of insight on how to improve your life and attitude.  I watch one
of his videos every morning on my way to work, and it puts me in a great mood for the day!

Try to reduce your time spent watching tv shows and movies, not that there's anything wrong with them, but if you are spending the majority of your free time watching tv, then you need to find a better way to spend your time.  These programs that we watch don't give us any useful information.  
I'm not saying that you should stop watching movies and shows all together.  It's great to have your favorite shows and movies, and there's a lot of great shows and books that make us laugh and feel good.  If something makes you laugh/smile, then it isn't a waste of time.  Just don't make watching tv the only thing you do when you get home.

#8 - Find something you are passionate about.

- Everyone has something that they are passionate about.  Maybe you just haven't found it yet.  Go out and try new things until you find it.  Having a hobby is a great way of blowing off steam and taking your mind off of things like work.  If you can turn your passion into your work, that is a bonus!

#9 - Make guidelines on how you should live your life (a mission statement)

- Put some time aside to come up with your mission statement.  What are important values to you?  Always go back to your guidelines and add/refine lines as you are progressing on your journey.  I know this can be time consuming, but once you have guidelines on how to live your life, you will making decisions and behaving in ways that match with the values you have recorded.

#10 - Have clear goals, and a plan on how you are going to get there.

- Many of us don't have any goals in life, but would you run in a race with no goal or end point?  We need to start thinking of what we want out of life.  Where do you want to be 5 years from now?  What kind of person do you want to be?  We need things to work toward.  And don't just have big goals.  We need the small victories along the way to keep us going.  Start making a to-do list for your day, month, and even year.  It feels so good to check off the things you've accomplished.  Writing your goals down will also help to motivate you to go through with them, since it is no longer just a thought in your head.  

#11 - Try and see things from other people's perspectives. 

- your first objective in any interaction should be to understand the other person.  Many of us can't wait to have our say, or give people our advice, and we aren't really listening or caring about what the other person has to say or how they feel.  Listen to what they are saying and try to put yourself in their position and feel how they would feel being under those circumstances.  This will greatly improve your communication with others, as well as strengthen your relationships.  

Well, that's what I've got so far.  If I come up with some more useful tips, I might consider making a part 2 of this thread, but we'll see.  I hope at least some of the things i expanded on above will help you along your journey.  If anyone has anything to add, be it any good books or videos relating to anything mentioned above, or if you have some tips of your own, please share them with us! 

Here are some additional resources to check out that I would highly recommend:

132,Does anyone get anxiety dealing with the phone?,"Specifically, for me, I know I avoid the phone because I'm an introvert and hate talking to people on the phone. But besides that, I started getting anxiety and intrusive thoughts every time the phone rang. I never talked to my parents on the phone, and so they only called when someone died...and my dog, uncle, and grandmother all died within a short period of time so that any call after... I immediately would begin thinking someone died.

To this day, when someone calls, my first thought is why is this person calling me out of nowhere? Who could have died?


Another thing I do is freak out if someone doesn't text me back, particularly if I'm attracted to them. I spiral, think the friendship is over, and waste hours on end ruminating about what I had said and whether it was really funny or worth saying. It can get me really depressed.",38,2014-02-21 11:20:19 EST-0500
133,"I feel SO much better and here is why/how, hopefully this will help others.","Hello everyone, i have been suffering from chronic anxiety for about 7 months now (probably pretty short compared to some other users).  It was starting to get really bad, and about a month and a half ago i started my medication. My anxiety focused pretty severely on 2 things:

1. My health: I was worried that i was dying, that i had some terminal disease, or that i was going to have a heart attack and no one was going to be around to help me. 

2. My personal safety: In alot of situations I felt very physically threatened, and usually in these scenarios i would inevitably make up in my head, i would end up dead. Absolutely terrifying.

Well i would like to confidently say I feel pretty much cured of my Chronic anxiety, especially the second fear. Here is how i was able to overcome it and convince myself that everything was going to be ok.

First off a HUGE shout out to /u/epicshift and his post on my most recent and only post when i was mid anxiety attack:

>In order to understand how to clear anxiety you need to understand how the subconscious mind and anxiety works.
Simple example:
At the age of 2 you're on the floor, crawling around like 2 year olds do at the neighbor's house when all of a sudden a big german sheppard gets out of it's kennel and starts running towards you barking. The owner grabs the dog before it reaches you but it scares you shitless.
The subconscious mind wants to protect us and because this traumatic event was your first encounter with a dog, your subconscious flags dogs as a threat to your safety. From this moment on, at the subconscious level, your brain has decided it will fire off chemicals to create a fear response when you're in the vicinity of dogs. This is COMPLETELY outside of the control of your conscious mind.
20 years later you're 22, and you've completely forgotten about this incident yet even the smallest poodle triggers you to go into a sweaty and uncomfortable fear even though the rational conscious mind can't talk you out of it.
This is how anxiety is created. It's can be through trauma, repetitive behavior (often our parents), etc ...

>ALL forms of anxiety have a root cause. They can also be cleared.
How ? By using techniques such as EFT (emotional freedom technique) and NLP (neuro-linguistic-programing - techniques for communicating with the subconscious) to alter the patterns. It's EXTREMELY simple. I've seen someone completely get over 10 YEARS of agoraphobia after a single 90 minute session.

>Most people have 0 awareness that these services exist and that they are very easy and effective.

>I hope this helps ... not only cope but understand that there is a root cause of your fear AND that it is clearable.

I'd say he was the first person to put into words what anxiety is and why it is there. Frankly for the longest time, i was terrified for a specific reason, but i couldnt figure out why that specific thing terrified me.  He was able to put it into words, and i was able to finally reasonably explain and rationalize my anxiety. 

Secondly i looked into what Timeline Therapy and NPL are, and what the process is to go through a ""session"". I HIGHLY recommend that anyone suffering from anxiety goes through and reads up on those 2 techniques. Whether or not you decide to follow through and take sessions, the ideas behind the 2 techniques just make SO MUCH SENSE.

Now i personally didn't take any sessions, i started with super basic self meditation, i looked back onto my past and pin pointed every single traumatic experience that could possibly relate to the fear i now felt. This was probably one of the hardest steps for me to personally take. It took a while to admit to MYSELF that these specific events traumatized me. Memory is often an issue, like in the quote from /u/epicshift, a traumatic experience can happen while you are extremely young, so i talked to my parents and guardians and went back as far as i could to find any traumatic experiences.

I looked back on those experiences and removed all negative connotations of them. This took time, however i am a strong minded individual(like i'm sure many of you are) and i feel like i conquered that really quickly. After removing the negative feelings of those traumatic experiences, i **IMMEDIATELY** felt a weight lifted off my shoulders. 

A big step that i am working on, and will continue to work on for some time, is convincing myself that these traumatic experiences were actually positive experiences, i subconsciously dwelled on the negative aspect of these experiences and completely ignored the positives. 

The final thing i finally taught myself how to do is to **Live in the moment**. I'm sure most of you have been told to do this and for a while people would say it to me, i would respond with ""That just isn't a logical/a thing people do"". But it is, it truly is. When you have a plan for the future it alters the way you live your day to day life. Obviously if it is a good plan, a vacation for example, planning for the future isn't necessarily a bad thing. 

But planning for the future and obsessing about the future are two different things. and unfortunately i can't really put that more into words or elaborate more on that, because it was a very personal rationalization. It's best to not live in the now in anticipation for the future.

Sorry for the wall of text and the fact that i'm an awful typist, i did my best to put it into words for people to read and hopefully to be as helpful as possible.  I am far from being rid of my anxiety, but i would have to say that i feel about 90% better, than i did even a week ago.  I am completely off my xanax, and have just finished weening myself off my zoloft and i feel amazing.  

**TL;DR Look into NPL and Timeline Therapy, Live in the now, enjoy life to the fullest.**


EDIT: As /u/twitchymite said in his comment: It happened to work quickly and efficiently for me, obviously, a disorder like anxiety can be extremely specific to the person.

138,Just a small tip to cope: Grounding Yourself,"This is my first time posting in any sort of reddit format. I recently discovered the joy of reddit and great subreddits like this one. 

Short bio: I have had extreme anxiety for the past couple years and I have found many ways to cope with it. 

The technique I will be describing is called ""Grounding Yourself""
Say you are in a meeting, sitting in a classroom, or just talking with a friend and your anxiety levels are slowly rising. In these situations it is hard to escape or take a step back without making a scene. So what I do is I ground myself.

141,Terrified of my new job,"Hello there. 
I just started my new job this week and it feels like the worst situation I have ever experienced in my whole life. Even though I should be very happy because I was unemployed for 1,5 years all my anxieties seem to emerge at the same time. 

I feel way too stupid for this job, even though I'm highly overqualified. 
The next minute I think they make fun of me because they all have better jobs than me.
It's my third day at work and I feel like people don't like me because I am weird and say stupid things. 
I can't sleep anymore at night and I am so tired at work.

All in all I feel like I don't deserve a job because I am too weird, too stupid and not at all a useful member of this society. 
I am a fraud in disguise (but I still think I look normal).

I am so scared I will make mistakes as this is probably my last chance jobwise.

I've never had a therapy and live a totally normal life apart from continuing job problems. My friends, boyfriend and family like me a lot and they've supported me financially.

I just feel I can't fit into society, I am very introverted and scared to death of meeting new people. My whole body is only a frozen mass :-(

143,How does anxiety effect your vocabulary?,"I notice that I begin sentences with ""I think"", or ""Maybe"" or some way of avoiding a permanent declaration. ""I feel"" is another one. Do you have any others? Speech or written word.

Edit:

I am really glad that this thread got so many responses because I knew I wasn't the only one for who anxiety effected my vocabulary. The way we speak really reflects our state of mind, and anxious people don't like to get themselves cornered in conversations. ""I guess""es and ""Maybe""s and starting sentences with ""I feel/I think"" leave me with a way out of feeling shame - after all, I was never positive, it was only a maybe. Or, I only THOUGHT something, I didn't say it was written in stone.

I don't think these are BAD to say, I just think that the anxious person uses them more often than the non-anxious person does and I am still not sure exactly why.

Keep them coming, it's interesting how many of your examples I've used myself!",15,2014-02-21 09:36:19 EST-0500

Driving. It terrifies me. Unfortunately, everyone looks at driving as a privilege, not a right. So people just assume I'm lazy, or a terrible driver. Forget them though, I am so proud at how far I have come, when it comes to driving! At 15, when my dad started teaching me, even though I had no desire because it was scary as hell. I would get in the drivers seat, and I would start shaking, I would break into a cold sweat and start crying. I couldn't control it. I hate driving. Not much has changed, except now I can actually drive. Just not legally. I'm on my third permit, and every time someone suggests I drive, my palms get sweaty and I get so anxious. I try explaining sometimes, 'I don't feel like driving.' Which is a much more acceptable answer than 'I'm terrified of stepping into the drivers seat.' The usual response though, is 'Get over it.' or 'Grow up'.

But it's not like I've never been anxious around these people before. Driving in general is very scary, and I get anxiety just BEING in a car. It helps if I have music on and I can focus on the scenery rather than what the driver is doing. Which is why driving is so hard, I can't shut my mind off, I have to think and stay focused!!!

I don't know, I feel like people think that what I am anxious over, isn't worth being anxious over. ",43,2014-09-25 22:14:14 EDT-0400

160,Psychiatrist refused to give me an appointment unless I called her on the phone,"So I got a referral for a psychiatrist from my therapist after my pcp refused to prescribe ativan or clonazepam which was recommended to me during a hospitalization. I have my mom call the psychiatrist, as I can't make phone calls because of my anxiety. The psychiatrist calls us back, and refuses to give me an appointment unless I call her on the phone. She even went so far as to say ""What, is he *shaking* with anxiety so badly that he can't pick up the phone?"" in a really sarcastic tone of voice. 

I feel absolutely awful now. I've been crying and shaking from stress. This made my mood much worse and I feel awful about myself. It reminds me of how useless and broken of a person I am because of my stupid anxiety. I went outside yesterday for the first time in months to go to therapy and it was really difficult. And now, the person who is supposed to help me get over anxiety tells me that she won't even see me unless I can call her on the phone? What kind of a thing is that to say to someone who has anxiety? And her comment insinuating that I don't really have anxiety? Does she think I'm some person begging for drugs to abuse? It's not just anxiety medication I need, I want to try a new antidepressant again(for the 4th time). That just makes me want to go outside to a doctor even less.

I sat in my car for an hour before the appointment all sweaty and shaky, walked up and down the stairs to the office twice before going in, but I DID IT! This is the first big real step to fixing half a decade of crippling anxiety! It was so overwhelming to get into action but now I've begun and I have a plan! I never ever thought I would be able to do this (scared, wasting therapist's time, etc) but today the psychologist told me: I have to stop feeling bad for trying to improve my life.

164,The girl I'm dating has mild social anxiety and is having problems meeting my close friends. What can I do to help her out? [xpost from /r/relationship_advice],"Hi reddit!

Recently, I've been going out with this girl for a while,  around 4-5 months and I really like her. So I guess emotionally, I'm kind of serious about her.

However, every time I invite her to hang out with me and my friends, she declines. Sometimes, she just downright freezes on the spot and refuses to budge. She says that every time this happens, she feels like throwing up and that the ground is going to swallow her. When we tried to talk about this once, she even cried about it.

According to her, she had been suspecting for some time that she has some sort of social anxiety disorder. I suggested multiple times that she should have herself checked by a doctor just so she could at least know what's happening to her. Or at least to figure out how bad the extent of her anxiety is. She refuses and says that she can handle it on her own. It's really important to me that she's able to meet my friends, as they are pretty much my family. But at the same time I don't want to force her into it or make her feel uncomfortable meeting them.

Is there a way for me to help her out with this in any way? Or a way to make her feel more inclined to meeting my friends despite her mild social anxiety? What do you guys think I should do to help?

Thanks in advance everyone!


**NOTE: Would it be wise to show her this in order to share your stories of overcoming your anxieties or would it better to just keep this to myself?**

I've also tried the one friend at a time approach. She wasn't too keen on doing it either.  :(

165,In what ways does anti-anxiety medication actually lessen a person's anxiety?,"I don't mean like how does it work on a chemical level. More like, how does it make you feel and why does this lessen your anxiety? 

I have social anxiety, and I'd say I'm a fairly anxious person overall in most regards. I've been prescribed Xanax to help me sleep (which I've taken once with pretty much no effect) and Lexapro to take daily (which I'm still not sure I want to start taking), but when I really think about it, I'm not sure I can see how this stuff is actually supposed to work. Like I guess I could see how it would work if I had a disorder where I was always really anxious about like getting hit by a falling piece of a plane, or something crazy and unlikely like that. But all of my anxiety seems to me like things I really should be worried about. Maybe that's the way it is with all types of anxiety, but I can't wrap my head around how something could make me not worried about the things I obsess over, without just making me totally care free, like I'm drunk or something. 

I also feel like for as much grief as my anxieties cause me, they're also a part of me, if that makes any sense. I feel like if I took something that made me never worry about them again, I'd be a fundamentally different person, and I'm not entirely sure that's something I want.

I've been feeling pretty anxious for the past day or so, so maybe I'm just not in the right space to comprehend this on my own. If anyone could try to help explain this to me or at least tell me about their own experience I'd really appreciate it. Thanks in advance.",31,2014-09-23 23:03:15 EDT-0400

181,Does anyone ever think back to something they did and get anxiety or panic attacks? How to fix this?,"Hey there!

Does anyone ever get sudden flashes of memory and become embarrassed or ashamed? Sometimes I feel down right humiliated and from this, I get anxiety what others may think if they remember it too and what will happen if someone mentions it. 

I'm currently third year university student. Sometimes I'll be minding my own business and then I'll get like an intense, mostly painful memories. It sometimes affects my mood for days and my anxiety levels soar.

It was something I know is sort of stupid. When I was 17-18 I tinkered with the idea of leaving a note for a next student or freshman in a book, in the library. I found myself worrying a) if I even made a note and left it b) what I put in it considering I was severely depressed and c) if someone recently found it who knows me and now thinks I'm messed up.

182,Something no one can take away from you,"For me, a big part of anxiety/depression is feeling like I don't have much control over things in my life. There are so many factors that determine whether you get the job, friendships, and relationships you want, and if you get these things, holding on them always feels incredibly tenuous. Not to mention all the crushing daily anxieties of social interaction caused by the fact that you can't control how people (mis)interpret you.

I've noticed a pattern in how many of us cope: exercise, gaming, self-isolation: these are all ways to spend time *on our own terms*. For a while, it really helped me to do some volunteer work, because I felt like even if everything else was turning to shit in my life, I could feel that I contributed a tiny bit of good to the world. I owned it completely. No one could take that away from me.

I think having something like that helps a great deal, no matter what it is. So that when you're having a panic attack and feeling like you're suffocating in a box, you can breathe a bit when you remember that the triggering situation doesn't define you. There's more to life, there's something that's still entirely yours and can't be taken away.

184,[Advice] Force yourself to smile and laugh to help reduce anxiety,"We all want to feel at ease, comfortable, and happy. But anxiety can make it really hard. We get stressed, feel bad, and then get more stressed, and end up in a negative loop. 

When it comes to managing anxiety, it can be hard to implement changes into our lives due to how overwhelming it seems. But by doing very simple things consistently, we can genuinely feel better and reap a lot of benefits. Examples of these types of things are smiling, and laughing.

When we smile or laugh, that's usually because of something that's made us happy. The action (smiling/laughing) is an emotional response to a stimuli. But, it also works the other way. 

We can actually do the action of smiling and laughing (even if we don't feel happy), to get the emotional response of feeling better.

**Forced smiles and laughter research**

For instance, in the study *[Grin and Bear it](http://www.scribd.com/doc/119200793/Grin-and-Bear-It-The-Influence-of-Manipulated-Facial-Expression-on-the-Stress-Response)*, the researchers found that forcing yourself to smile can reduce stress and induce a positive affect (emotion or feeling).

If you want an even stronger benefit, then you can laugh. There are many [studies](http://www.bupa.co.uk/individuals/health-information/health-news-index/2005/hi-160305-laugh) that show laughing can induce a range of positive benefits:

* Laughter boosts your immune system which helps fight infections.
* Laughter boosts blood flow, and can reduce the risk of heart disease.
* Laughter reduces pain, which has led to funny videos being used in anaesthetic rooms at Manchester Children’s Hospital.
* Laughter reduces allergies.
* Laughter makes you happier, which is good for your mental and physical health.
* Laughter reduces stress.

Forced laughter also increases Heart Rate Variance (HRV), according to [this](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22894892) study. HRV positively correlates with being calmer, and more in control of your emotions. Studies like [this](http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs12160-009-9101-z) one have even led to psychologists calling HRV the body’s best measure of self-control.

High HRV makes your heart healthier, and therefore, makes you healthier in general. Stress, on the other hand, does the opposite. It reduces HRV, thereby reducing our health and self-control.

Smiling and laughing improves our health, heart, and reduces stress - all these benefits increase HRV, which perpetuates further anxiety reduction.

Smiling and laughing therefore, are a quick and easy way to induce positive affects, feel mentally and physically healthier, and reduce stress.

If you feel good, you’ll do good. If you do good, you’ll feel good. So forcing yourself to smile and laugh, consistently, are great ways to help alleviate the effects of any negative loop you might be in, and help get you out, and even put you in a positive loop.

**Forced and natural smiling and laughing work**

Of course, these benefits don’t have to be forced. Natural smiles and laughter work too. So you can watch funny videos, read jokes, or hang around with positive people. But if you aren’t in the vicinity of something external that can make you feel positive, no problem. You will always have the ability to physically force yourself to smile and laugh if you need a quick boost in mood and self-control. This is an excellent and easy tool to add to your arsenal for feeling better. Smile and laugh consistently, and you’ll convince your brain to feel good consistently. And if you feel good consistently, it'll be easier to get on with your life.

**Smiling and laughing as a daily health recommendation**

The amount of studies which advocate positivity (smiling, laughing, and being happy) are numerous and growing. There are many health recommendations we hear about, like eating 5 portions of fruit and vegetables a day; drinking 8 glasses of water a day; and using the stairs instead of the lift – all so that we can live a longer and healthier life. It’s only a matter of time for smiling and laughing a few times a day to join these recommendations.

**TL;DR** Smiling and Laughing makes you happier, healthier, and reduces stress. Force yourself to smile and laugh, consistently, to reap these benefits, consistently.

185,How I cured 16 years of severe depression and anxiety/agoraphobia with food.,"Hi everyone.

I was directed to this subreddit after posting my story about anxiety/agoraphobia and depression elsewhere. I didn't know this subreddit existed until today. I am going to go in depth into what my anxiety was like for me and how it spiraled out of control and also how I cured my anxiety and depression through changing what I ate. If you are really sensitive to anxiety stuff you may want to skip to the end. 

**TL;DR: I changed the way I ate and was able to get rid of a lifetime of depression and 16 years of anxiety.** 

I was depressed for most of my life. The first time I remember wanting to kill myself I was less than 10 years old. This is a mentality that persisted all through childhood and into my late 20's. This, combined with the beginning of panic disorder when I was around 12 caused me to see myself and my own life in a very negative way. 

In the beginning of my panic disorder I would have attacks sometimes 3 times a day. I was nauseous, light headed, freezing cold and shaky. I had trouble breathing and swallowing. My body felt like it was shutting down completely and I felt paralyzed when even one symptom of my panic attacks would show up. I was taking gravol in the morning, in the afternoon and before my job in the evenings. My life was spent in a haze. Despite being in therapy I found that my symptoms were not being alleviated and I had to force myself through each day of my life knowing that I would likely wake up already anxious, spend my day in that state and have trouble sleeping at night due to my catastrophic thought patterns as I was already anticipating my anxiety the following day. This was a cycle that I lived in from the age of 11/12 until 27.

In my mid 20's my anxiety attacks took a bad turn into agoraphobia. Where I was able to force myself to school and work and sometimes to social events I now found it impossible to go to the grocery store, the gas station, the bank or even to stand outside of my apartment on a nice sunny day. I had to leave for my job over an hour in advance knowing that I'd have a panic attack on the way and would have to allow extra time for ""emergency stops,"" etc and time to back out of going into work if things got too bad. At this time I was not medicated. I was very isolated, had no social life what so ever and the only thing that kept me going was having 2 cats that needed me. I was sometimes able to get into the grocery store to buy them food, but I could never be in there long enough to buy food for myself. I had to go through drive thru's just to get something to eat, and even in my car being in the lineup waiting was nearly unbearable. 

I ended up in therapy again for the 4th time in my life knowing that if I did not get my anxiety and depression under control that I was going to kill myself. I could absolutely not see another alternative. I was desperate. It took me nearly an hour of sitting in my car in front of my apartment to motivate myself to drive down the street. Mind you, this doctor's office I was going to was walking distance but I couldn't stand being outside and needed to have an immediate escape route at all times. It took me another 30 minute in the parking lot at the office to calm down enough to get in, only to have my anxiety get completely out of control waiting to see someone to get  help. I was shaking and sweating, clutching a bottle of water like my life depended on it, constantly scanning my surroundings for a place to hide or an excuse to get out. 

Eventually I saw a doctor who gave me a prescription for ativan to get me through my worst days. I was set up with a therapist and had to focus on functioning before I could get help.

Before therapy I had put in hundreds of hours of research into curing my anxiety. I looked into meditation, walking, binaural beats, Z-Point release, drinking more water, trying to burn off the extra energy with more exercise, breathing exercises, counting exercises, etc. I had tried nearly everything in the book including anti-depressants which made me more suicidal. Finally, I was able to talk to someone who I felt like I could be open with and she was very surprised that despite the level of anxiety I had that I was still marginally functional. She was also amazed at the amount of coping skills that I had. However, she believed that I would likely have anxiety and depression for the rest of my life because it ran in my family and made the suggestion that I go on meds again. I was very hesitant. I was even hesitant to take Ativan after reading the information on it and seeing that it could be very addictive.


**When My Food Changed:**
Finally, she had given me some pamphlets on how to eat for anxiety. It talked about the role of sugar and processed foods in the body, insulin spikes, sugar crashes, etc. A lot of this information made sense to me and started me on a journey towards researching nutrition. At this point I lived off of mostly processed foods. I hated all vegetables. I barely liked any kind of meat. I was eating very little because I couldn't get to the store, and sometimes after a few days I would order take out and end up binge eating. This also contributed to issues I had with my weight.

After some time, I discovered eating whole foods and how they interacted in the body. Over a very long period of time I stopped eating grains, sugars, dairy and essentially anything that could spike my blood sugar and send me spiraling. I wasn't thinking about changing my whole diet or eating healthier. I was thinking about eliminating everything I possibly could that would cause me to have anxiety or depression. Over the months, I came upon the Paleo diet and all of the researching surrounding a lower carb, higher fat diet and everything started to click in place. As my tastes expanded to like more veggies and even meats, I noticed that I was beginning to lose weight that I thought I would have on me for the rest of my life... You know, because of ""genetics."" 

As it turns out, my therapist was wrong. It's been nearly 2 years since I have had an anxiety attack. I no longer suffer from crippling depression. I now have an active social life, a great relationship, am at a healthy body weight and I have been living a life that I NEVER thought was possible for me. 65lbs later I am the healthiest I have ever been. I am re-learning how to live and be this new person that I have found in myself. I never realized how limited I really was by my anxiety and depression and I am kicking myself for not realizing how easy it was to start getting rid of it. All because I stopped eating processed foods, sugar, grains, etc. Even though those were huge staples of my diet through my whole life I can really say that I don't miss it and I don't miss being a complete mess.

I just wanted to share this story for any of you who are going through bad anxiety and who have tried every other trick and gimmick in the book. I so strongly encourage you to look at what you are putting in your body and how it may be affecting your physical and mental health (which often go hand in hand).

I'd also be happy to offer specific articles, studies, etc that I have read that helped me along my journey and even maybe write up what my days look like in terms of food/exercise or answer any other questions you may have.

Good luck to all of you. You can reclaim control of your life! ",66,2014-09-01 20:05:45 EDT-0400
186,Should I live alone and comfortable or be social and miserable?,[deleted],40,2014-09-07 00:50:39 EDT-0400
187,"Are your 20's meant to be confusing, anxious and lonely?","Apologies in advance for the long post. I'm a guy turning 24 this week and I guess i'm just wondering is it normal to feel like this in your 20's? I wouldn't say i'm depressed and there's moments where I really feel like i'm enjoying life, but my 20s has been way more difficult/awkward than I imagined.

I have suffered pretty bad anxiety since I was around 14, mainly health related (hypochondriac) and also a bit of social anxiety aswell. I thought I would've outgrown this by now, especially social anxiety. I've improved in this area over the last few months, but I feel like an outlier for someone my age. I shouldn't worry so much. Should be living in the moment.

Loneliness is also something I suffer with and didn't expect. I'm an only child so you think I'd be used to it by now but sometimes I feel pretty damn lonely. I don't have a huge circle of friends (1 very good friend who I'd see a lot) and 3 or 4 other mates who I'd see every couple of months. This is in stark contrast to the people on my facebook feed who have great lives and are most probably never lonely. I haven't been in a relationship since I got dumped over 2 years ago and i'm still living at home.

I don't really have any social hobbies (because of the anxiety), so i'm not sure how to reduce the feelings of loneliness. I obsessively compare myself to other people my age and have an idea in my mind that most twenty somethings are always busy outside of work with either social hobbies or girlfriends/boyfriends whereas my typical day after work involves playing guitar in my room or watching soccer. My typical weekend involves a few drinks on Friday and sometimes Saturdays, with pretty much nothing done during the day.

I've only had sex with 1 girl and without sounding sleazy I thought this was meant to be the most promiscuous stage of life where you go through multiple sexual partners? I've got with girls on nights out but i'm always too drunk to actually have sex with them, even when its basically on a plate for me. I'm sure other people my age have been with well more than 1 person!

I'm also kinda confused about what I want career wise. I graduated last year from college and have a job until December but after that I'm not sure that I want to continue in that line of work. I've a desire to live in a city outside of my country for at least 1 year but no idea what i'd be doing. I guess I just thought I should know by now what I want from life as im assuming most other people my age do.

Are your 20s really meant to be a struggle? Or am I just overreacting to a pretty normal thing that many people go through? Any advice would be appreciated.",8,2014-09-07 02:45:35 EDT-0400
188,Is love possible?,"I'm unemployed, severely depressed, pseudo-suicidal (if i didn't have such a great fear of death I would have committed suicide a long time ago and would now if I hadn't), and have borderline agoraphobia from my anxiety and I was wondering if any of you guys in a similar situation have been able to have a relationship. Where do you meet someone? What do they think of your condition? How do you feel about the relationship?

189,One year practicing mindfulness - this is how I changed,"TL;DR I had severe anxiety and agoraphobia (spent months without leaving the house), but now my anxiety is almost compltetly gone.

I shared my story few months ago (http://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/22ww9w/my_rather_long_story_of_conquering_sa/ if anyone is interested) and I wanted to write a quick update, becuase it has been almost one year since I started practicing mindfulness meditation.
Let me just say that mindfulness meditation totally kicks ass. Until recently I didn't know what it feels like to wake up feeling confident and rested. 
Since I can remember the first thing I noticed and thought when I woke up was the panic, the pain in my stomach, the stress and the feeling of danger. 
On days when I had to interact with other people, it was even worse - I could barely hold it and not break down.

But something has changed ... something in my brain and the way I process certain situations.
The anxiety is replaced by a feeling of confidence that I can handle any situation (even when that's not the case :)). In other words I do not worry whether I am going to get a panic attack.
I think that the confidence is the result of the fact that for the first time in my life I started to love my self. Love - not like in being narcissistic, but accepting - I accept my thoughts, my worries and everything I am right now. This acceptance IMHO is the crucial part - holding on hard to an idea that I have to be this or that is the thing that kept the status quo and prevented me from being able to change.

The fear and the anxiety from the possibility of getting panic attacks is the thing that kept me in my shell so much time. I do not feel the need to plan ahead every little detail of my interaction with others.
And I used to do it a lot. I used to spend so much time on imagining how a conversation will go, what I will say, what might happen. Or the ruminating about past conversations - oh, I really hated this one.
Sometimes I catch a thought of anxiety, but it remains just that - a thought. I notice an old trigger thought coming and going so easy now that I sometimes wonder what all the fuss was about and why was I so afraid and even ashamed of my thoughts.



Now, what I did/do: 
I started with 10-15 minutes two times per day, everyday. I simply couldn't handle more at the beginning. 
Few months later I was able to sit 45 minutes. More than this and I was beggining to feel the urge to stop ... like my mind couldn't take it anymore and needed to rest.
Right now I can sit up to 2 hours, before my body gets physically tired and I have to stop. 
There are different recommendations on what to concentrate on - some say on the sensations in your belly while breathing, others say on the tip of the nose... I prefer the sensations in my belly. Although with time it becomes less important and you can ""be in the moment breathing"" without needing too much effort ""tuning in"" to any bodily sensations... it just becomes effortless.

My advice to you all - start meditating, do not be hard on yourself, be patient and accept yourself the way you are right now and things will get better. Persistance is the key.",19,2014-09-05 20:15:44 EDT-0400
190,My skin is crawling.,"I just can't deal with that feeling where you feel completely uncomfortable in your skin. Everything's jittery and there's a pit in the middle of your stomach taking away a lot of your breath capacity.

I can't concentrate on anything and my eyes are just darting back and forth all over my room searching for something I don't know. 

I just feel so frustrated all the time for no reason. I'm glad for days when my anxiety isn't that bad so I can just focus on dealing with depression. But dealing with both at the same time is just unbearable. 

Some days I just want to leave everything in my life behind and just walk nowhere until I collapse and die.",10,2014-09-05 08:58:03 EDT-0400
191,Today's Anxiety Mantra,"Today, I'm choosing to refresh my mindset. Flip the positivity switch back to the 'ON' position and let the things that hurt me, irritate me or cause stress in my life roll off my back like water. I will love fearlessly but never waste a speck of energy on those who no longer enhance my life in any way.  



It's no secret, I'm the type that gets extremely affected by the actions and lives of others. I don't like to admit it but I'm extremely sensitive and struggle to stay a float, often drowning in a sea of my own emotion. Each day is a test, a battle. Most days I go to bed feeling like my anxiety has won. But not today, nor tomorrow. I will teach myself new thought patterns, breathe deeply and remember that I am not my anxiety. I am simply a living breathing human being that deserves a good life and peace of mind from time to time. I will allow myself this, I will participate in activities that calm me. I will face things that I am afraid of head on, improving little by little with each new day.


This is all I can do. I refuse to believe that this is something that is “happening to me” and I just have to lay down and take it. I will decide if I’ll let it consume me or not, I will silence my brain to allow myself some tranquility and coax my racing thoughts into submission from time to time.

194,"I don't know what to do, my anxiety is taking over [Help]","I'm 18 and have had mild anxiety all my life, but it's been getting a lot worse this past year. In my last year in college I couldn't even make it in for weeks even though I enjoyed it, I would throw up every morning and feel incredibly sick and when I did manage to get into college I often had panic attacks. Sometimes I was okay as I was heavily distracted with work deadlines and having friends around. I went to see a doctor about it at that point and she basically told me to get over it and couldn't give me anything as I was under 18 at the time.
After finishing college I went job hunting and for the most part I was okay, and didn't have much anxiety, I went to my first interview feeling unwell due to it but it didn't get to the point where I would be physically sick. I did get through many packets of mints though.
I got the job and my first day I was okay (yesterday), but today I went into work supposed to be doing 9-5 but only managed 9-2. I didn't sleep the night before and threw up in the morning before leaving. I felt heavily sick the entire day, and since I got up until 2 I had this overwhelming urge to cry and kept getting tears in my eyes whilst working and I didn't know why. Eventually I had to excuse myself to the loo and cry and throw up.
I haven't stopped crying since then (almost 2 hours) because I feel so stupid for going home on only my second day of work, and I also feel like I'm not going to be able to manage and will get fired over it if I keep having to do it. I can't go In to work tomorrow as I threw up and you have to wait 48 hours so I'm going to the doctors but last time I went about this I could barely speak because I was in tears and didn't like talking about it, I feel so pathetic. 
I work in a nursery for 0-2 year olds and the people there don't know I've been suffering from anxiety and they just think I have a stomach bug. You would have thought I'd be distracted in a nursery but there's actually little to do other than sit on the floor and talk to kids who can't talk back to you. I thought this job would be perfect for me but even if I did get a different job I'd still have the same problems.
I literally wish I could curl up into a ball in my house and never come out. I hate it and people just keep telling me to get over it but I don't know how. I also wish I could work from home but I don't think that's even a possibility, or easy to come by. 
I just really need some advice please. If anyone has even taken the time to read all of that I appreciate it.",14,2014-09-02 18:57:23 EDT-0400

197,Someone Help Please,"please i can't take this anymore. i feel like a fucking monster. i feel like i'm going crazy. EVERY LITTLE THING gives me a panic attack. like, (please please don't joke or mock me about thisi already know how insane it sounds) yesterday i was texting with someone via facebook and the time was 9:45 pm but the time it marked as the 'seen message' was 9:46 pm and the rational part of my brain keeps telling me it was just a mistake, especially because this someone had been talking to me all day and posting stuff and so, it couldn't not be them and the more i talk about it, the more i realize there's no problem BUT I NEED to be sure and so (look at how crazy i am) i created fake accounts to see if the problem was there too, and i realized by the time the clock marked 20 seconds to the next minute, fb would already mark the next minute. for example, 8:44:40 pm and fb would already mark it as 8:45:00 pm, you know? and the problem is now gone and the reason i'm telling you this is just so you guys can see how crazy i am because that sent me over the edge and i don't know why. i kept thinking how ridiculous i am. what, the person was seeing the message from the future? by one minute? 

and then, for some crazy reaso, i started crying like hell and sometimes i don't even believe things are actually happening, i actually doubted that conversation even happened, i'm scared because this is serious, isn't it? doubting things are happening. sometimes i doubt the person i was talking to is really the person i'm talking to. what if there's someone mocking me on the other side?

yes, i had a few problems when i was younger. some people made my life a living hell and now i don't trust anything, i can't even believe someone might be falling in love with me

and these tiny little things make me cry and have a panic attack. i had a panic attack over a photo, i had another one when i convinced myself of something that wasn't true and i do mean panic attack---the out of breath, am i going to die kind. 

i just want to breathe. i don't know how to breathe anymore, my nerves are all damaged, my muscles all cramped, i have headaches and other aches all over my body and they never go away, they never ever go away i just want some help
i already saw someone, i already talked about,  when i try to talk about it with people i'm close to i get yelled at because they can no longer hear me, they can't stand me anymore and i don't blame them, it's like every time something EXTREMELY GOOD happens i get an anxiety attack

i feel like dying
please someone say something
am i gonna be alright
it's all in my head isn't it?

EDIT: thank you everyone who commented and helped me. i feel a lot calmer now, i feel sane. even if it's just for today or i don't know, i feel a little bit of relief. thank you thank you <3",19,2014-09-05 05:33:29 EDT-0400
198,"[Help] Has anyone ever had anxiety wake them up from sleeping, and then turn into a full blown attack?","At least, I think that's what happened. Before I tell the whole story, I'll say this: I'm a 22 year old female, currently not on any medication. I've been diagnosed with social anxiety and generalized anxiety in the past but it's also currently affecting me. I was recently diagnosed with PTSD, however, after an incident that happened in January.

So, a few nights ago, I'm at a friends house. We had been smoking pot, drinking a little, having fun. I don't do that sort of thing much anymore, maybe only a few times a month. This was the first time I'd smoked in two weeks. I lay down to go to sleep, and it must not have even been 2 minutes later that I was woken up to my left shoulder jerking. Super hard. It was my shoulder/chest. It scared the hell out of me, and I darted awake. As I sat up, I had this feeling creep over my whole body. It was like hot water but cold water at the same time, and I felt like I was floating or about to just... die. So I went to the kitchen to get water, as I also felt light headed. By the time I'm in the kitchen, my arms are not just shaking, but they're jerking. My legs started to do it too. And for 45 minutes I sat on the kitchen floor jerking about, not able to stand or move or hold anything or get myself to breathe normally. The jerking itself is what freaked me out the most at first. I just kept crying and panicking because it felt like my legs would never stop, and I just felt so awful inside. I've never had that feeling. It was the worst thing. I can't even describe it with words now.

After about an hour I started to have really bad chest pains. Before that, my chest was definitely tight. And it felt weird. But it randomly started hurting in the middle of everything else that was happening. And I just honest to god thought I was going to die. The pain was unbearable. It was like fire, knives, cracking. All in the middle of my chest, and I could feel my heart twitching and palpitating through my skin. All the while, still practically convulsing. I kept getting a bad headache, and my ears would feel like they were going to pop, and then they would ring, and then my face went numb. So, after almost 2 hours I was like, screw this, I'm going to the hospital. Because, yeah, I've had anxiety attacks for about... 8 years now, and NOTHING like this had ever happened. So I really didn't think that's what it was. And if it was (I'm thinking it was), I wouldn't have been able to logically handle the situation at that point anyway.

When I got there my heart rate was above 120. They gave me an EKG, set me up to a heart monitor, and watched me basically calm down. My heart was still jumping all around, but I finally stopped twitching and being in excruciating pain after about 3 hours. They said at first they thought I was having a seizure, but nah, it was probably just severe anxiety. And I was like, wait, whut? REALLY? Simply because I'd never felt that way before in my life. I never knew I was capable of having anxiety THAT bad. 

I went home, slept a lot. The next day I felt like shit. So sore everywhere, even in my chest. My legs were weak. I took care of myself and then the next day I was feeling even better. Today. Without really thinking about it, I decided to smoke a little bit of pot today, too. I had one hit. And then... the feeling came on again. The light headed, warm water, cold water, tingly feeling. I can't find any other way to describe it other than that. It's like a feeling just rolls in onto you, and you can't push it off. It sticks. And I was like, wait. No. Fuck. This is NOT happening again. I had to go sit outside by myself to try and keep it at bay, but my legs started twitching again, and I kept forgetting to breathe and I kept randomly crying. Luckily I had a lorazepam left over so I took half of it, and an hour later I was ok. 

So, my gut is telling me it's the weed. I don't know what else it would be, unless I'm having some kind of weird new PTSD kind of anxiety. Which it could be that too. Has this ever happened to anyone else? Sorry if I did a terrible job describing... I'm still a little weird from the lorazepam. But the night when it was REALLY bad, I had smoked significantly more than I did today when it happened again to a much lesser degree. It could also just be a combination of everything, and the state I've been in these past... 8 months. 

But seriously. That night when I went to the hospital, I thought I was dying. I was convinced. I was jerked awake to a COMPLETELY physical anxiety attack. By my body. There was no emotion to it. I wasn't sad, or anxious, or worried about anything other than the fact that my legs were jerking and I couldn't stop it and inside I just felt this horrible dread like feeling, like I wasn't gonna make it out alive. I even started thinking about my funeral before I went to the hospital. That's when I was like, okay, if I actually think I might die, I need to go.

Sorry if I'm ranting. I'm still a little flustered and not fully recovered from it all. But if anyone has any insight or can even understand my messy paragraphs, I'd love some feedback or advice. Anything would help. Thank you, I'm gonna go pass out now. :P",13,2014-09-02 14:03:31 EDT-0400

208,Anxiety has been getting in the way of me applying for jobs.,"I'm a recent college grad that's living away from home in a different city right now due to the difference in the economy and my focus in my career. Because I have no income right now, my parents are supporting me, but they gave me a six month limit to find a job because by then it'll be too much of a financial strain for them.

I've been working on sending out resumes. The searching-for-jobs part I don't have any problems with, but tailoring my resume and sending it out has been very difficult to me. Worrying about what I'm doing wrong, giving a bad impression, afraid of getting stuck in a job I hate, afraid of failing and ending up (and being stuck) back home where there's almost nothing for me starts piling up in my head when I get ready to work. Very quickly, I start feeling sick, tired, and scared and sending out a simple document suddenly feels like I'm trying to push a boulder up a hill. I usually end up wasting most of the day trying to push myself to do this and, even if I do get something accomplished, I feel unsatisfied and disappointed that I allowed myself to be affected so much.

I've been trying to take baby steps so I can get SOMETHING out, like calling it quits for the day when I send out three resumes. JUST THREE. And I have managed to do it once before when I was applying for jobs I didn't care too much about (it was just so I had something), but thinking about applying to the companies I do care about and the possibility of not getting any response back terrifies me.

What I really need right now is some help to shift to a less harmful mindframe. I'm worrying about the worst and it's doing nothing but hurting my chances to send stuff out.  Anyone got any advice?

**EDIT:** Thank you so much for the responses, everyone. I wasn't expecting this many replies so quickly. The advice and support from this thread is amazing and I'll be looking at it frequently when I'm sending applications and I need to chill out. As evidence from this thread, there are many of us that are in the same fight. I wish you all the best of luck with your search, and I hope this thread will be of some value to you.


**EDIT 2- Day 3 update:** I want to thank everyone again for the help. Your support was exactly what I needed to get the ball rolling. Sending in applications have been getting easier. I've gotten a rejection response already, but I'm not letting it get to me. I still freeze up when a job description or a company's application process seems daunting, but rereading this thread helps me through it. I can get three applications out now without much hassle. I wouldn't have been able to do this without y'all.",21,2014-01-08 00:03:10 EST-0500

211,It's a new year and I'm already accomplishing some of my goals in overcoming my anxiety...,"Hey guys, 


I've posted here a couple times so I wanted to give a little update for anyone who cares. 

A huge part of my anxiety is being afraid of going places alone, specifically going into any kind of establishment like stores, coffee shops, the doctor's office, etc. The other day something motivated me to go to the store. I was feeling pretty relaxed, but I really wanted to buy some food. I didn't let myself get psyched out, I just did it. I told myself that if I wanted to leave the store at any point, I could. Once in the store I actually felt great. I didn't feel rushed or panicked and I took my time picking out my items. In fact, I even found myself smiling and feeling overjoyed and even interested in interacting with people. 

This is a huge accomplishment for me because for the last several months I could only go into a store (or anywhere in public really) if I was with someone I really trusted like my boyfriend or my mom. I'm 20 years old, so this problem made me feel pretty ashamed of myself. I can't say I've officially overcome this problem, but at least I'm facing it and making good progress. I think what helped me the most was that I did it for myself, I did it because I wanted to, and I was able to logically walk myself through it, reminding myself of all the options I had. 

I just had to share this somewhere it could be appreciated. I feel a bit ridiculous telling people the ""news"" that I was able to make a successful trip to the grocery store. 

I didn't specifically set this goal or anything, but I do have some new goals for the new year and I think subconsciously I figured that if I want to accomplish all these other things, I'm going to need to conquer my fears of things like going to the store. So I wish the best of luck to the rest of you who are trying to accomplish anxiety-related goals. Try to get out of that mentality that you ""can't"" do it or that you will ""never"" do something again. Try to open your mind to the possibility that maybe you'll face your fears, and hopefully that will lead to the actual motivation and courage to do so. 

Happy new year!  ",14,2014-01-08 09:46:27 EST-0500
212,Update about my anxiety over drinking & turning 21. I'd also like to share how I learned from this community's thoughtful replies about how to refuse to let my fears have power over me.,"Hey everyone,
I just wanted to update you on my previous post about [having anxiety over drinking and turning 21](http://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/1uwhj4/having_a_lot_of_anxiety_over_drinking_and_my_21st/). Basically, I was incredibly anxious about getting drunk and not being in control over my body and fear of throwing up.

I am a common contributor with my non-throwaway account, and I was so thankful for your replies. I ended up drinking quite a few beers, but because I am a petite girl I quickly reached my limit. I took your advice and drank water and just relaxed. Although I didn't particularly like feeling dizzy/not in control of my body, I kept your replies in mind and realized that I'm okay. I'm not gonna die, I'm not gonna go into a coma, I won't become addicted from a couple beers. I did get sick after I came home, but I was able to calm myself down with the advice I got on this sub. I hadn't gotten sick in 5 years, so that was a big step for me to be able to control my emetophobia by taking deep breaths and realizing it will soon pass.

Thank you to this sub for all you do for me and the rest of the community. I am so glad I could have a great birthday that was relatively worry-free. I realize it was one of the biggest milestones, and I am so thankful I didn't sit around at my apartment because of my anxiety. I didn't let it control me; I didn't give the power to my fears. And it wasn't nearly as bad as I thought.",2,2014-01-11 22:08:48 EST-0500

214,How I won,"When I was sixteen I realised that there was something really wrong with how I reacted to certain things. I knew I’d always been shy, slightly introverted, happy in my own company and a little neurotic when it came to wanting people to like me, but things were slipping worse than that. 

I had an obsession with death. I was constantly worrying about the death of a loved one and I treated every meeting with people like I would never see them again. Every time I was ill, no matter how minor, I was dying. An ulcer was mouth cancer, my acute anisocoria was a brain tumour and every pain in my chest was a gripping heart attack that threatened to extinguish me from existence, completely forgotten within generations. 

A year and a half later I began having weekly Cognitive Behavioural Therapy. Part of my therapy was recording ABC sheets. This was an exercise where A was the antecedent, an environmental stimuli; B was my beliefs and those combined led to C, the consequence. I was told that I could never change A so instead I needed to fix B. Change my beliefs. It wasn’t easy going against 18 years of reinforced behaviour but eventually I began to make progress. We traced the origin of my condition to my mum’s depression when I was a kid, which was catalysed by my skirmish with Christianity between the ages of 13-15 when I tried to turn to God to find assurance, but was told by the pastor that many people who I know would not be heading to heaven.  

So after ten weeks of CBT I was a changed guy. It was a glorious July when I finished the treatment. I used to bounce home down the hill in the sunshine after every session. I can’t describe the feeling of euphoria as I grew stronger mentally. I thought I’d put it behind me.
And for one year I had, I had an excellent first year of University, I had the fresher’s experience and met some incredible people. I was starting to think that all this was going to work out. I began caring less about what people thought, indulged in being a polemic (I should mention, I want to be a writer/journalist) and relished causing trouble and demanding to have the spotlight on me for once. 

Then for no reason at all, on the day I moved into my new flat, it all came back. All the beliefs switched back to the unhelpful default and I was plunged back into that paralysis. I struggled through the winter, often not being able to get out of bed through being so low with my condition. My then girlfriend and I decided to end it and I became reserved, helpless and completely distraught. That was rock bottom. Had I not had a totally crippling fear of death I would have killed myself. 

I struggled through to the end of the year, immersed myself in my studies and self-improvement. It felt good to be working towards some kind of grand narrative but the seclusion wasn’t healthy. In the summer I began dating someone else and I resolved myself to get better again. 

I started taking a low dose of prescribed betablockers every day. I absolutely hated being on them as they turned me in to a zombie. It was like all my emotions were hidden behind soundproof glass. I went back to university as did my girlfriend and we broke up. I knew it was going to be the same story over again.

But only if I let it. This is the crucial part of the story. I realised that this was either sink or swim. I could break, I could spend the rest of my life talking about heartbreak and how my anxiety was the fault of others. I could live a life of “if only”s and I could end up being 50 years old as the man who could have been anything if life had been different.

I don’t know why, but I wasn’t prepared to let that happen. So I began a lie. I told people I’d got over my anxiety. I told people the betablockers had worked and it was time to try without it. *I chose not to have anxiety anymore*. It’s been 4 months now since I’ve felt any symptom of my disorder. 

My point here is that, for me, anxiety had become an excuse. It had become a way of life, a defining characteristic and no matter how much I fought it, “got better” or took pills to control it, as long as I knew that people ascribed that characteristic to me and for as long as I felt I could use it whenever, I was never going to get better. I realised the importance of stepping up and of being able to be strong.
Without the CBT I doubt I could have done this and I’m not trying to say that it is just a matter of choice at all. I am saying though that no matter what demons you face, you are the common denominator. You are where it begins and where it ends and if your brain has the power to create a monster, then it also has the power to take it down.

218,My 7 year old's anxiety - An Update,"Original Post here:  [Trying to get a better understanding of my 7yos anxiety](http://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/1tz4f4/trying_to_get_a_better_understanding_of_my_7_yos/)

First of all, I want to thank everyone for their OVERWHELMING support in my last post.  As my wife and I read through the comments, there were confirmed fears, positive words of encouragement, and confirmation that we're at least on the right track on helping her.

I can't even say how unbelievably happy we are with the progress that she's made over the past few weeks.  It's been unbelievably hard, with some painful days, and some amazing surprises.

The first thing that's happened is we were able to get rid of the ""fake drama""  My daughter is really really intelligent and realized that if she were to show anxiety like symptoms we would often back down, give her time to calm down or change our plans as appropriate.  She was taking advantage of this.   Working with her counselor we were able to find a few signs that were the different between REAL anxiety and her FAKE anxiety.    

Armed with this info we were able to properly discipline the FAKE anxiety.  All it took was 2 times getting caught and all of the fake anxiety is gone.   It is AMAZING how large of a percentage of her episodes were either fake, or were brought on by her getting herself worked up over the fake anxiety.

As far as school is concerned, this is a mystery.   Monday of last week was the worst day getting to school, I had to put her in the car, restrain her to put on her seatbelt, she screamed the entire way to school and had to be pulled out of the car.   That night was the first time she was punished for fake drama (we took away her American Girl doll, with promise she could earn it back)  Each day was progressively better, and by Friday she hopped right out fo the car and went right into school, no issues.   We're hoping in a few weeks we can get back on the bus!   Her attitude has been REALLY positive as she earns rewards for each step she makes further (the same reward system we were using before this week, nothing has changed on that front)

Now we can work on the real anxiety.  She still is anxious about making decisions, clothing, food choices, etc. have all been minefields for her.   We've been able to pick out 7 ""safe"" outfits, so she doesn't have this overwhelming choice of clothing in the morning trying to put something together.   We've also been able to do the same with ""menus"" of sorts in our house so she can chose things like breakfast easily, again without getting overwhelmed.  Little wins have happened here though, she was able to pick out her library books at school without a meltdown.  

It's like I have my daughter back before all of this started, we're still working through things, and thankfully she's been more willing now to go in and talk to her counselor, and seems that she's now willing to listen and use some of the techniques she's being taught.  

Sorry it's another wall of text, but I'm just overjoyed with our progress and the fact that we can now WORK on it and aren't stuck in an endless loop.  I'm constantly fearful that things will come back on strong but now feel that as parents WE have some tools to better help her.

Thanks again!",3,2014-01-14 16:49:50 EST-0500

220,Finally saw a doctor and got prescriptions!!,"I'm 21 years old and have had anxiety since about the 7th grade, but it really started to get bad in 11th grade when I would skip classes if I was 20 seconds late so I didn't have to walk in and have people stare at me, or when I would voluntarily fail classes in high school and even college, so I didn't have to present.

I basically just have an avoidance problem with people. I don't want to put myself in any situation where people my age can look at and ask me questions. I officially got diagnosed with Generalized Anxiety Disorder (even though I'm 100% sure I have social anxiety), but thats besides the point.

I finally saw a doctor about this after so many years of dealing with this silently by myself. I was freaking out on the way to see her and I had a mild panic attack and couldn't stop crying but I forced myself to go there. 

I got put on Clonazepam(Klonopin) and Sertraline(Zoloft) to take daily, starting at pretty low doses and working my way up. I don't really know what this post is for exactly, I'm just really excited about all this....hopefully these will help me out a ton, and fingers crossed I don't get horrible side effects!

226,Does anyone else ever feel extremely worthless over menial mistakes?,"Hey guys, I've posted here once before but with no help, so I'm going to give it another go..

So today I put in new contacts, straight from the package. I went to school for seven hours, then worked for another six hours. I came home and was dead tired. I had reminded myself throughout the day that my old contacts were still in my case, so I *NEED* to get those out before I put my new ones in it with them, without realizing it. By the time my day had ended, I had forgot and done exactly that. No big deal, I can just take the ones on the bottom and throw them away, thus solving my problem. When I tried to do this, my mind went to autopilot and I threw away the first, new contact, then it hit me. It's okay, it might've landed on a tissue that was wadded up in the trash can, a good cleaning job on the lens and it should be fine. I looked at the trash can, saw that there was nothing in it but the nasty, uncleaned bottom of the can littered with gum and other gunk, and my brand new contact lens.

Even though this is the most trivial mistake to make, and it was kind of humorous in a way, I felt dread. I felt like I was a hopeless excuse for someone about to go to college in the fall. I just wasted a perfectly good lens that cost a decent sum of money, all because of my incompetence. I felt like crying or punching something, which nearly escalated into a full-blown panic attack had I not calmed myself down. Does anyone else ever experience things like this?

I hate having general anaesthetics, I get very anxious and scared and my worst case scenario thinking comes out in full force.

I am struggling to stay calm about it tonight. Even though I know it is a relatively minor procedure, they will not know what they need to do to resolve any problems until they are in there.

I know my surgeon and trust her, but it is still scary to me and I am going over all the things that could go wrong in my head. It is not helping that I am having to take strong painkillers and they are clouding my ability to process my thoughts logically.

I am going to be a nervous wreck going in there, and last time I remember crying as they put me under because I was so scared that I was never going to wake up again.

So I am feeling miserable and in pain and just looking for a bit of support and sympathy :-(


**edit** So I am home safe and sound, but minus one ovary. I will find out more tomorrow when my surgeon cals. Thanks for all the hugs and comments of to take my mahooosive painkillers now xxxx

230,"""You can't have anxiety because...!""","I cannot stand it when someone actually has the audacity to say something as rude as, ""What? You have anxiety? No way!"" And then inserts some justification as to why I'm making that up.

For me, it's usually ""You can't have anxiety! You do speech and debate!"" Yes, I can get up in front of a room of 1-7 people and give a practiced speech. I love it! But that does not negate that I have trouble meeting new people, am incredibly sensitive, have crippling phobias, and get incredibly nervous when talking to people I don't know well. And yes, I can do prelim rounds pretty easily, but if I break to out-rounds, I'm a mess and can barely function, I get so nervous!

Just because I like doing something that doesn't fit your definition of anxiety does not mean that there are not other aspects of my life in which I struggle with anxiety. It's really the same as saying, ""Oh, you're smiling now so you can't be depressed!"" or ""You don't seem to be in pain so your foot can't be broken.""

Speech and debate is something I'm happy to be able to do. Not everyone can, and my anxiety is not as severe as others. I get that, and I understand that my anxiety is nothing compared to the struggles many go through everyday. But I absolutely cannot stand it when I feel that I can trust someone with knowing I struggle with anxiety and they throw back ""but you do speech!"" ",44,2014-04-16 09:16:51 EDT-0400

233,I feel great (hoping at least somebody reads this),"
I'll try not to get way too detailed with this, but I just have to share this experience I had with you all, as you all are the only people I know will understand this at this moment. I'm not the best writer in the world so I might go into a bit of a tangent with some stuff but all this is being written with pure retrospective emotion which I hope adds to it a bit:

 I've been struggling with crippling general anxiety for a couple years now, and health anxiety (which has gotten very serious in the past few months). Throughout the time I've been suffering with this I've been experiencing long term depersonalization/derealization which has taken a huge toll on me mentally and physically. I would wake up confused and feeling weak, go through the day completely terrified and go to bed focusing only on death and what I could possibly have that might be killing me. Of course I acknowledged many times that ""it's just my anxiety making it worse"" or ""it's all in my head"" but those acknowledgements alone weren't enough to help me in the long term. Around last year in the 4th quarter of the year around October or November, I started to have mild GERD, and over the last few months it's gotten significantly worse and has mutated my anxiety into a powerful force that has been completely corrupting my conscience and has been turning me into a shell of a person. I recently went to a friend's wedding and in the duration of that trip I almost felt normal again, but there was that lingering feeling of not being real or complete that would instantly bring me down and ruin everything. After I came back from the trip, I felt like I was reaching a breaking point, and I was absolutely right. The last few days I had been sinking deeper and deeper into a depressed state, and yesterday I was starting to get suicidal. I started to feel exhausted and took a nap, and when I woke up something happened that put me into a falling out with another family member, and I was about to go through with the suicidal contemplation (but I'm still unsure of whether or not I was actually going to do it). And after I didn't go through with it, I broke out into tears and felt  completely dead for the succeeding hour. Eventually I started to feel a bit better (as better as I could at this point) and the day moved on. Then today, everything was feeling pretty average. Wake up feeling slightly sick and uneven, worried about everything involving my health, spend an hour in the bathroom because of IBS, and go downstairs and sit at my computer for a couple hours. Then I was about to take one of my daily walks when I began to have this rushing feeling of being unreal and crazy, but far worse than ive experienced frequently. I thought taking the walk would subdue the feeling but it only got worse and I decided to go to my backyard deck and have a seat and try to relax. I slouched on a deckchair, listened to the new Antlers album and tried to relax, as difficult as that was, and the more I relaxed the more my anxious mind started to think I was actually dying. But this time the feeling was different, it wasn't worried feeling of foreboding death...but a relaxed one. I was ready to take it in and let it happen, and of course it didn't and it was just my regular mind being relaxed. The music was still playing, and there I was sitting having a real relaxing moment in my backyard, looking around at the trees in front of me day dreaming about being somewhere of natural beauty like Switzerland or Norway, when I see a squirrel running across the tree branches. My eyes followed the squirrel, moving from branch to branch, temporarily altering the still nature of those trees only for a moment, when something truly wonderful happened. I don't know why this happened, and as hard as I try to make sense of it I still cant (not that that matters to me)....but I felt true joy. Something I haven't felt in over 2 years and I couldn't contain it. I started to laugh and feel like I was a real, normal, living human being with a personality. All the while the music still played in my ears and only boosted the emotions I was feeling. 

And eventually it was over, but this time I didnt go back into a slouch of depression. This time I realized something I hadn't really though before, and that's that everything that worried me about death doesn't matter. Of course physical health and well-being is important, but my exaggerated thoughts about it could be subdued because I still have that potential of feeling true joy, while still feeling completely dead, and those feelings are what is the most important to look back on before it all ends. The events that transpire to make those feelings are beautiful in their own right, but the feelings that they actually give you are what coats those memories and gives them meaning and a more thorough context.

I'm not trying to make a central/focused point with all this but If I were to do that, it would be that however bad your anxiety/depression is, theres always that potential for even a short moment of clearness that will shine a light on everything, and it's those moments short or long that you have to hold onto, because it's the moments that are always potentially ahead of you until you die.

235,Boyfriend was honest and said anxiety outbursts are ruining relationship.,"I am a 26 yr old male and my anxiety outbursts and perfectionism are ruining my relationship with my 27 year old boyfriend. I'll try to keep this short. 

Essentially, I've had anxiety my whole life. I was raised by anxious perfectionistic abusive parents. I realized when I was twenty what exactly anxiety was and I've been working on it for what feels like an eternity. I've had several long term romantic relationships throughout my twenties. All of them have ended for various reasons, but all of them were definitely affected negatively by my anxiety. I can see that now, retrospectively. 

In my day-to-day life all is usually well. Work goes smoothly. I have good friends. Etc. But sometimes certain things just trigger these incredible anxiety outbursts. My body locks up. I shake. I'm terrified of losing my mind or hurting myself. I want so desperately to communicate with my boyfriend but my throat and voice are locked up. I cry and scream and feel so shameful and apologize during and after the episodes. They last ten minutes to one hour. The aftermath lingers for days. Lots of suicidal thoughts after due to shame. I would never kill myself though. I just get this overwhelming sense that everyone would be happier without my craziness polluting the planet. 

Often times they are triggered when the bf and I are debating issues or fighting. I'm also very perfectionistic on myself and on him. I have goals in my head that I've set for him regarding diet and exercise, drinking, smoking, and I get overwhelmed and annoyed/anxious when he is not reaching goals. Even though he is making great progress at times. I do the same thing to myself. I exercise twice a week always but still beat myself up because i don't always go four times a week. I do heavy heavy lifting. Full body. 

I feel like a total piece of shit when I realize what I am doing. But in the moment I can't tell how perfectionistic I am being or how insane my outbursts must seem. It's definitely not normal. Scary tv shows can trigger an anxiety outburst. Things I see on the news or on the street can trigger them. My boyfriend has said he doesn't feel like he can share any negative emotions with me--whether it's being upset with me/disagreeing with me about anything, or any negative emotion unrelated to me--and is always anticipating me having a ""breakdown."" It's not healthy for him either. 

Please. Any help is appreciated. I just need somewhere to begin. A type of therapy? A type of medication? A name for these ""outbursts"" so I can do more research. I've tried lexapro and hated it. No sex drive. 

I've considered that maybe we are just incompatible but it's not the case. We have a great sex life when it's ""on"" and shared dreams and plans. He is caring and wonderful with kids. My family loves him. I love him. This problem will just follow me to another guy. 

EDIT 04-22-14

I've bought the book ""when panic attacks"" because it was highly ranked on Amazon with great reviews. It's essentially a CBT workbook. I've done these sorts of CBT worksheets in the past. I've set a goal to make this a part of my life. Not just for now but for a good while. It's taken 26 years to build the man that I am... I can't expect to change my thinking instantly. The author talks a lot about how doing the exercises is very essential, not just reading the book. ",45,2014-04-20 22:19:36 EDT-0400
236,I havent left my house in two years. Help.,"I havent left my house in two years, because i have really bad anxiety. Im only 17 years old, but anxiety is really affecting me. I kept on having panic attacks at school,  and sometime i was sent home, sometimes i was told to suffer through it, sometimes i couldnt leave my house and go to school. My parents decided to finally home school me. 

The only things that help with my anxiety are pacing, i sometimes am walking back and forth my house from the time i  wake up and the time i go to sleep, i just cant calm down enough to sit down. Some times i cant sleep good, i once was up three days in a row because i coudnt calm down. 

Do you know any tips to help me calm down?

I was on a medication once but it made me feel weird and i havent tried another.

237,[RANT] So ANGRY right now,"So angry right now.  It's burning in the back of my mind.  I can't get what I need so I always just curl up and get out of peoples way.  WHY!  Why get out of the way?!  So they can ignore me?  So they won't be inconvenienced?!?  Why should I care so much what they think or feel?  It's like I got swallowed up by an empathy monster and now I can't feel what I'm feeling because I'm so worried about what other people might think of what I'm feeling.  That's not even empathy is it!  That's a great FREAKING plan isn't it?!  Right up to the point where the only answer I have left is to punch that jerk in the face!  Just break his nose and feel the blood splash over everything.  Then maybe people would take me more seriously.  Maybe that's all they ever listen to.  You try to be nice right up to the point where you die and then all they have to say is ""gee, why did he do it?  Why did he just give up like that?!""  I'm pretty sure I wasn't born this way.  I'm pretty sure I was fairly healthy and strong at one point.  But then what happened?  OTHER PEOPLE HAPPENED.  Terrible people.  And now here I am.  Broken.  Way too old to be fumbling with trying to even talk to another human being.  To the point where I feel ghoulish, where I go for days, weeks, sometimes months without physical contact with another person or even a conversation beyond ""hey.""  Then when I do reach out to someone, anyone, to have some kind of meaningful conversation or moment or anything, I can't make it come out right and they shrink away from me.  They leave, they ignore me, they seen put off and walk away, and I just try to keep out of peoples way again because that's the nicest thing I know how to do for people where I won't mess it up........ok..........I don't feel angry anymore.  Now I just feel really sad.  That's better right?  Right?  I'm going to listen to music now.  If you read this far, thank you for listening, even if I never tell you in person it means a lot to me.  If you didn't read this far, then you're not reading this now so I could type anything and you'd be none the wiser...rutabaga. ",20,2014-04-17 05:56:30 EDT-0400

At the beginning of this year I decided to say, ""fuck it,"" and got to the doctor. I had a huge panic attack while there, but I managed to force myself to wait there for over an hour to see my doctor.  
I was prescribed Lexapro and have been on a journey of exponentially getting better. I spend the majority of my time out of the house now, and am even starting to apply for work!  
Thanks to my SO, GP, and Therapist I have been able to make huge strides, when I never thought I would be able to have a life again.  

I guess what I'm trying to convey is that I believe everyone can make it through. Just remember in times of panic and anxiety that it can not harm you in any way.

(weird thing to think about I know) After several bathroom trips to try to splash cold water on my face and get it together I just got the shakes. Shakes went from bad to worse. My heart was pounding, getting the vertigo, couldnt breathe, and then came the worst- jelly legs. I could barely type out a letter to my supervisor letting her know I have to miss work (yet again). I started to panic because not only were my coworkers who didnt know I suffered this watching me in horror- I'm immobile and cant get to my husband's car. Finally my kind hearted coworker grabbed a wheelchair (i work in a hospital) and quickly wheeled me away to the lobby where my husband was waiting in the car. I was terrified to come in today.

246,Feeling short of breath? Here's why.,"I saw that there was quite a few people with this problem so please take a minute and read this post. If you have asthma this also worth a read!

I know that some of us with anxiety have developed a condition called ""air hunger"" the feeling of not being able to get a satisfying breath. I suffered from this for many months and had several medical tests taken to rule out anything else, but i'm proud to say that I have reversed this condition and I would love to share on how I did it.

Long story short, the reason why you feel air hunger is because your body has low carbon dioxide levels as a result of stress. When under stress, you breathe in more air and exhale a greater amount of carbon dioxide. This creates a viscous cycle causing your body to inhale more and more deeply to maintain the carbon dioxide level. If you continue to do this over a prolonged period of time, then your body deems your increased breathing volume as ""normal"" and as a result you will constantly feel short of breath unless you keep taking in big breaths.

Your goal is to break this habit and restore your oxygen/carbon dioxide levels back to a healthier level. You can do this by practicing the Buteyko method. Dr. Buteyko spent decades researching how our breathing affects the body. There is a lot of info to follow so I left a link at the bottom of this post, but the goal is to reduce your breathing volume by practicing simple exercises. One thing to remember is that you should be breathing through your nose and into your belly. Mouth and chest breathing is a bad habit that many people don't realize.

The following is a simple way to measure your carbon dioxide level: Also called the Control Pause technique.

Step 1: Take a few small breaths and try to relax your breathing. Make sure to have a stopwatch handy.

Step 2: Slowly exhale completely and once you have done so, hold your breath and start the timer.

Step 3: Stop the timer when you feel the first urge to breathe, remember this is not a test of how long you can hold your breath, if you find yourself gasping for air then you held it for too long.

Step 4: Record how long you held it for before needing to breathe, this is your Control Pause score.

If your CP is below 10 seconds then you are breathing several times over the regular amount. 10-20 means you're breathing over double the regular amount. Your goal is to consistently hit 30 or higher. A higher score means your body is more oxygenated and is not deprived of carbon dioxide.

Next up is a technique to restore your carbon dioxide levels. While sitting, place your finger horizontally under your nose. Do your best to breathe only through the opening of your nose for 5 minutes. This will help you increase your carbon dioxide level. Now repeat the Control Pause Technique and record your score.

Repeat this three times in sequence and do it twice a day. Keep a journal of your progress. Don't get discouraged if some days you don't do well, keep at it! 

Remember, try not to take big deep breaths throughout the day, instead practice taking small amounts through your nose! It may be hard at first but it gets easier and easier.

I encourage anyone suffering from air hunger to check out this website and give it a thorough read. This is going to take dedication, but once your reach the finish line you will be much stronger person that ever before. Several people already have messaged me about their great results!

Please search Buteyko method on Youtube and you will find a lot of valuable information and more breathing techniques.

249,Had an anxiety attack (I think?) in one of the worst possible situations. No where to escape to.,"I'm on a trip with my college course and it's an over night camping thing. I was fine mostly until I was laying down in the tent trying to fall asleep. Then my stomach started to hurt, like it does when I'm having anxiety, so I tried to get through it but it was getting worse. So I woke up one of my tent mates, who was already aware that I was uneasy, and we changed locations to this empty community center building across the street (this is where the bathrooms where that we were supposed to use). That place was a tad bit creepy so that wasn't exactly helpful. Then we returned to the tent and my stomach was even worse. We have to be up very early to complete the tasks we ate here for so it is terribly inconvenient to have no sleep tonight. Also, there is no comfortable place around. No cars to take me somewhere, we're an hour and a half from home and we are in such a small town that it doesn't have any permanent residents, only the people that pass through for research ever occupy the town. So I'm basically stranded. It's the worst attack I've had before, at least because the situation amplified it. I've not seen a doctor about my anxiety but now feel that I should maybe in order to avoid situations like this one, sleepless, uncomfortable and embarrassed. I don't really know why I'm posting this but it's helping pass the time until everyone gets up. Well, thanks for reading if you did.",2,2014-04-19 13:15:11 EDT-0400

257,[rant] We can see you in about a month! How the US mental health system is broken,"To anyone who manages mental health services in the United States: the system is wholly jacked and makes it far too difficult for someone who is already struggling with keeping themselves together to navigate this mess in a timely fashion. Let me illustrate:

General practitioners telling patients to call their insurance company to find out what coverage is available and get a list of potential doctors so they could make ANOTHER appointment to talk with their general practitioner again just to get a freakin referral or recommendation.

Once people get their referral and they call that DR's office they are told they have to wait a month or longer to actually see someone.

Appointments cannot be arranged by email? Really?!? How does that accommodate those who have telephone and social anxiety? Not to mention conjuring up the energy and courage to maintain that phone tag crap.

Even the definition of someone in crisis is a problem. Does a person really have to have gotten so far into their issues that they're contemplating suicide before we consider that person in crisis?!? What about someone who has disassociated and completely checked out?

Finally, there's an assumption that people seeking help in the US healthcare system can advocate for themselves but those suffering from anxiety and depression struggle with daily tasks, let alone intensely stressful tasks such as having to call multiple times just to reach a person making appointments.

And this rant doesn't even touch on financial side of this issue.",30,2014-04-23 21:51:21 EDT-0400

262,Please help me. I (F25) am worried there might be something really wrong with my sister (F35).,"My sister Sam has suffered from severe depression and anxiety throughout the past ten years, but took medication and went to therapy to deal with it. About five years ago, there was a slow but darker shift; she stopped leaving the house, never hung out with friends and stopped attending any social events. She couldn't keep jobs, because she was getting too much anxiety; she stopped answering the phone or e-mails. Finally, she moved back into my parents' house to save some money and because my parents were worried about her well-being.

Over the past two years, she has stopped leaving her room at all if it will result in any interaction with my parents or guests. She doesn't work and doesn't leave the house; she doesn't spend money either, my parents basically just provide a small amount of food and insurance for her. She waits until they're gone to eat and shower. They live across the street from my husband, baby and me (just to illustrate how close my family is - we have weekly 'family dinners'), but I have literally not seen or talked to my sister in a year. She's never met my baby girl. The few times I have dropped by their house unannounced, I could see her running to her room and shutting the door; when my parents occasionally speak to her, she looks away, can't look into their eyes and answers very quietly. I have never seen this severe a reaction to social interaction (with family members, not even strangers) and I am really scared that I may never see my sister again. 

What is happening to Sam? This seems to have gone beyond anxiety to something much scarier. What would cause someone to never leave their room and be so terrified of speaking or calling or looking at anyone? Please help me.

Tl;dr
My sister is a shadow of the wonderful, affectionate girl she once was. I haven't seen her in a year, even though she lives next-door. She won't look anyone in the eye. What is happening to her?

I would never say I wish you knew what it felt like. Because I would never wish this on anyone. But I wish you understood what it feels like. I want you to understand that every single day is a struggle for me. Every day I fight my god-given flaws just to make it through. Things that are easy to you are hard for me. Getting out of bed. Getting ready. Going to work. Going to class. Maybe you think I'm using my depression as an excuse. Maybe you think I'm being dramatic. Maybe you think I'm being lazy. Maybe you don't know half of what the fuck goes on in this head of mine.Maybe you don't know what it's like to spend most of the day in a battle against your own thoughts , your own brain. The anxiety is crushing. And it takes so much energy to fight it back, to fight off my irrational self. Do you know what it's like to not be able to trust your own feelings, your own perceptions? Every day is a war between my thoughts and my feelings, but you never see it. Maybe sometimes it spills out. In my outbursts, in my breakdowns. You get a glimpse, but you have no idea the things going on up here in my head. Part of me wishes I had the capability to explain it to you. Part of me doesn't want you to know cause you'd think I'm crazy. But I do want you to know how hard it is. How exhausting it is. How much of a handicap it is.


I go through so many peaks of emotion in a day. The other day I was having a bad morning. I was sitting in front of the mirror doing my make-up. I would start to cry. Then I'd stop, tell myself everything was ok, I'd be okay, took a deep breath and I was fine. 30 seconds later I was sobbing again. Days like this I'm sensitive to the smallest tings, like an emotional time bomb. My anxiety spirals and my mind just becomes a mess of toxicity and irrationality. Not all days are like this because I fight off the toxic thoughts and emotions.


So I want you to know, how hard it is, for me to go to class, to study, to go to work, to remember bills, or important days and dates, to fill out paperwork. It's harder for me because I've already given so much of my mind to the task of staying sane. To the task of keeping it together. It occupies so much of my time, so much of my self. All the while I'm trying to figure out myself, to be myself. So I hope this letter gives you even the smallest indication of what it's like to be me. And I hope it halts the judgement and the second guessing and the disappointment. Because I am trying my very hardest. And all things considered I think I'm doing a damn good job. And I'm proud of myself. And I want you to be proud of me too. I'm healing. And I intend to get back to a place where every day isn't a battle, where it all comes a bit easier, and I'm free to focus on myself and my life, not the toxic thoughts.


Until then, maybe you can understand.



**EDIT:** As the title says, I didn't intend to show anyone this, besides you reddit. But now I'm wondering if I should show this to who I wrote it for, particularly one of my good friends. I need her to hear these words...but I'm also scared of whether or not it will be taken seriously and what her response will be. What should I do? ",5,2014-04-22 00:53:04 EDT-0400
270,A reminder as exams come up,"I saw this on Tumblr whilst procrastinating and thought it would fit in well here. If, like me, you have exams coming up look after yourself. You are more than your grades.

>“Your mental health comes before school baby, always. If its midnight, and you have an exam the next day but your hands have been shaking for the past hour and a half and you’re not so sure you want to be alive anymore, pull out that carton of Ben and Jerry’s and afterwards, go the fuck to bed. So what if you get a 68% on the exam the next day? You took care of yourself and at the end of the day that will always come before a high test score. To hell with anyone who tells you differently.”

271,Spent 4 days in a mental hospital and it saved me,"Hello fellow redditors, I spent the last 4 days in Bayside Mental Hospital. I wrote a blog post about the experience so if you're interested you can check it out at the bottom.
  
I suffer from sever panic attacks. I went to the hospital. I then was sent to a mental health clinic. The point is it helped me more than anything else I've ever tried or done in my life, so if any others on here suffer from incredibly debilitating symptoms I highly recommend going to one. I got more help there in the first day than I have in the last 6 months.  
  
  
tl;dr If you have an extreme, and I mean extreme, anxiety problem I highly recommend taking a stay at a mental ward, they will change your life.

275,"Anyone ever feel normal for once, then get anxiety because you don't have anxiety?","I've been struggling with anxiety lately and it seems like I'm on the verge of a panic attack almost every day.  This morning I woke up feeling great with no anxiety.  The problem was I only got about 5 hours of sleep.  I usually need about 8 to even feel like a normal person.  Now I'm wondering why I feel so good today and that in itself is giving me anxiety.

Edit: Wow, I didn't expect so many responses. Glad that I'm not alone (although I don't wish this on anybody, so don't take that the wrong way). I guess I should say, at least the way I feel is relatively normal so that eases my mind.",43,2014-10-16 21:21:26 EDT-0400
276,One of my worst fears that caused a lot of anxiety has just been realized. And you know what? I'm okay.,"This is mostly directed at hypochondriacs and people with specific fears, but I hope it helps anyone who deals with anxiety. 

Like many hypochondriacs on this sub, I have always been pretty scared of developing diseases. Every cough was the flu, every headache was brain cancer, every twinge was something lifethreatening. I discovered this sub and it helped immensely to see that I wasn't the only one who freaked out and ran to the doctor when something seemed up. I googled symptoms constantly, and was so scared of developing one of those inhibiting diseases that ruined my life. I didn't have anxiety- my anxiety had me. 

Well, now it's happened. I started having actually scary neurological symptoms (I'm not giving details because I'm NOT sending one of you running to the doctor- not the point of this post at all!!!) and got admitted to the hospital a few days ago (Another thing- trust your doctors! If they think something is up, they will keep you and test you and poke you with needles, and when they tell you you're okay, BELIEVE THEM. Unless they're worried, you shouldn't be!). 

Long story short, I have MS. It's a huge bummer. I'm not gonna lie, I'm scared, I cried, I beat a pillow and cried some more. But then I realized- now that it's actually happened/happening, all that anxiety was just wasted time. It didn't keep me from getting it; it may have made me slightly more aware of what was going on, but I would have gone to the hospital and gotten this diagnosis even if I didn't spend the last three years anxious as hell about actually getting it. 

My message to you all is to try to relax, because the fear of getting this is almost worse than it actually happening. I know the unknown scares you, and you have EVERY right to feel what you feel. But try to get help, and understand that diseases and cancer may seem like they're happening everywhere, yet they're not! They're just loudly talked about. You are almost definitely NOT in that group! If you're scared you are, go get a checkup, go get those tests, then trust in your doctor to know that those test results are true and interpreted well. 

Even if, god forbid, you get something or one of your fears gets realized, guess what? Because you've dealt with this horrible monster called anxiety, YOU ARE INCREDIBLY STRONG AND YOU WILL GET THROUGH THIS. 

**YOU ARE AMAZING.**

**YOU ARE GOING TO LIVE A GOOD, LONG LIFE.**

**YOU HAVE THIS COMMUNITY TO SUPPORT YOU.**

If you haven't gotten help yet, or slacked on therapy or your meds, go get help! You are not alone! BREATHE! It's going to be okay.

Share a victory this week! No matter how small, it's a victory!

I'll start: I got diagnosed with MS, and I decided I am going to kick its ass. I will have MS. It will not have ME!

278,Today I drove without panicking! Yay!,"I've had a learner's permit since I was 18 but I was so terrified of cars and driving that I never bothered to get my G2. Sometimes being in the passenger's seat triggered anxiety attacks for me, much less actually driving.

Now I'm 23 and next spring I'll be starting a job that requires tons of long-distance driving :(  So, I have 8 months to go from complete rookie city-slicker to being able to drive on snowy northern highways. 

Today was my first time driving on a major city street and it was unpleasant, but I didn't freak out. I still felt very tense, but not panicky. Aside from accidentally running a stop sign, and hitting the gas instead of the brake once, nobody died in a horrifically fiery explosion and everything was ok.

282,"Anybody feel like unless you're constantly doing something, you get really anxious and bad thoughts begin to repeat themselves?","Because to be honest that's how I feel. I go to school 1 day a week and off for the next 6. 

I could go get a job and make some money on the side, but the past 3 jobs has had me work 5PM-2AM shifts, and after working until 2 in the morning while having to deal with people, it's kind of left a sour taste in my mouth. I dont want to work another late night shift job unless I have to.

I have few friends and could join a social group at my school, but people generally annoy me and I get exhausted pretty quickly and get headaches around people I dont know. So there goes that out the window.

Finally, since I'm taking programming classes at school and learning to become a programmer, I could teach myself more advance techniques and learn new languages as I go along, but I'm such an unmotivated shit that unless it's school work, I'm too lazy to do it.

Then since I'm doing almost nothing all the damn time, bad thoughts begin to repeat themselves like ""haha you aren't cut out for this field, quit while you're ahead yoh idiot"" or ""anyone can code that, now do something more advance, oh yea, that's right, you cant!"" since I'm too damn lazy to teach myself new things. Sometimes the buildup gets so bad I have to physically punch myself to calm down.(luckily rarely though)

Hell, to be honest few things honestly get me excited besides maybe video games, but I beat them so quickly with all this freetime that it just leads back to the problem of sitting around doing nothing.

Overall, I feel like I'm going crazy doing absolutely fuck-all sitting on my bed all day long. I mean, I'd like to go out and do stuff, but asocial issues/anxiety prevent me. I feel like pretty much my every reaction will be ""no"" or ""please don't bother me"" Any advice?",23,2014-10-21 05:36:26 EDT-0400

286,Yesterday I quit my job.,"Today I am depressed and anxious. It's horrible. It's been this way for a very long time, admittedly not as bad the past 18 months (until recently). 

But yesterday I made a very big decision. I quit my job. 

I'm going to try chronicling my journey from now on. This isn't something I've done before so I don't imagine it will be very colourful, inspiring or even interesting to read. But this is for me, and perhaps with an audience I'll have more courage to take positive action in my life.

291,CVS is suddenly refusing to refill my prescription and I'm having a meltdown,"For the past year I've taken 600mg of Welbutrin daily.  Two 300mg time release in the morning.

My insurance plan didn't want to pay for it at first, and we had to go back & forth between the pharmacist at CVS, the doctor prescribing it, and the insurer before they'd agree to pay for it... I don't know what the exact process is, but they all figured out that I could get 32 of the 300mg pills per bottle with a normal copay.  Those 32 pills last me 16 days, and I've *always* been able to go back to CVS on day 14 to request a refill.  We've always had to go through this drill where the pharmacist says ""I'll have to check with a manager to put this through"", and then they do, and it goes through, and they give me another bottle of pills within a day or two, before the 16 day mark.

A few weeks ago I went back on day 14 of the cycle to refill, and they told me the prescription ran out and the doctor needed to write a new one.... I got stressed that I wouldn't be able to get medication, but called the doctor, he immediately sent in a new script, and everything was fine....

Two days ago I went back, on day 14 of the newest cycle, to refill.... The same pharmacist as last time, who had previous told me the script ran out, was there... She told me I can't refill until a 17 day interval has passed.  I asked her if there was an issue with the new prescription and she told me no, it's fine, but she still can't refill it until 17 days.  I asked what changed?  I've always been able to do this?  She says something must have changed on my insurance plan.  I left, called my carrier, and verified that coverage had not changed at all (I'm one of their agents and service all of my own insurance policies... I knew nothing had changed when she first suggested it, but checked anyway... Nothing changed.)... Then I called the doctor, and he said the prescription was word-for-word what it was before.

Now... I went back today, this morning, on day 16, and the same damn pharmacist was there.  She told me to come back tomorrow.  I told her that if I come in tomorrow, submit a request, and then wait the day or two for them to fill the script... I will have gone 48+ hours with zero medication... I have enough for today, and that's it.  I told her just let me pay for the pills myself, I don't care if it costs a ridiculous amount.  I. can. not. function. without. these.  Let me buy them.  She said she would need a new prescription for that.

I didn't even respond and drove off (it was at the drive through window)....

Long story short I'm at work and have had to shut my office door, block the windows, and leave my phone off the hook because even though I'm still medicated, I'm so fucking scared of what will happen tomorrow when I'm not, and can barely function right now....

What the fuck happened?  Is this pharmacist just giving me a hard time?  Should I somehow pull myself together and speak to her supervisor, and hope that she's been doing something wrong?  What if she's right, and I really have to start taking several-day lapses in medication before they'll refill?  Do I need to juggle two prescriptions like she's saying?  I'm so flustered about this that I haven't even called the doctor back to see if he can do anything, I should, for some reason I haven't been able to, I'm stuck in a puddle of fear & nerves and don't know what to do about this.... I'm already mid panic attack, talking to CVS again is causing severe anxiety, even seeing that pharmacist again is causing anxiety.... Why can't they just give me my pills like they always have?!",27,2014-10-17 18:40:32 EDT-0400

312,The Rules of Social Anxiety,"I was just browsing tumblr when I came across this poem. I thought it was pretty on point.


The Rules of Social Anxiety

1. Walk with eyes fixed on the ground 
They are watching, laughing, judging
Walk normal
Don’t focus on it too much or you will stumble and be made a fool of

2. Look like you are writing and busy in class
avoid being called on
you know the answer but what if you stutter or mumble
What if they tell you “speak up I can’t hear you”

3. Don’t make a noise
hold in that cough that sneeze that breathe
people will hear you 
do not draw attention to yourself like that

4. Spend time every night before you go to bed to think
Think about all the embarrassing things you have ever done
Everyone remembers, that’s all they remember

5. Never enter a room full of people
They all look
Why are you here?
Why are you alive?

6. Your friends all secretly hate you
you know why they didn’t reply to your text
you know how they all dread seeing you
you are only put up with because of pity

7. Always be scared
Scared to sit next to a stranger
Scared to see someone you know
Scared to eat in front of people
Scared to talk on the phone
Scared to go to social events
Scared to order at a restaurant
Scared to talk
Scared to have a panic attack
Scared to be noticed

Always scared
but don’t worry,
you don’t like people anyway,
at least that’s what you say,
you’re “antisocial”
You don’t even care what they think, people are annoying,
that’s what you tell them.
You play it off as a joke
but really you’re always scared.

316,Need Advice! Girlfriend with Anxiety/Panic Disorder,"So my girlfriend of the past several years suffers from high anxiety and stress. Whenever she goes through life changing events (moving/new job/family crisis) she is VERY prone to panic attacks. Most times they are what I would consider extremely intense, wherein she believes she's going to die and/or says hurtful things to her family and friends. 

I know this is debilitating for her and I would like to learn how to help her cope before, during, and after an event. There have also been times where the lack of emotional control almost brought an end to our relationship, and I would like to prevent that ever being a possibility again. I have tried everything in my very limited arsenal (over-attentiveness, logic, short bouts of avoidance etc.) but nothing has ever had a positive effect. Or at least not one that I've seen. 

If anyone has been in a similar situation, please tell me what I can do to make her episodes more comfortable for her and less tolling on those around her.
Thanks /r/anxiety!


[Edit] I just wanted to give a sincere thank you to everyone who genuinely took time out of their day to help a couple you will probably never know. I was a bit nervous and hesitant to share something this personal on Reddit but you guys really understand the situation my girlfriend and I are in.

320,"This helped me a lot, it might help you as well","So, this is something my therapist made me do a few weeks ago and it really helped me. This may not help a lot of you, but I can at least try.


1. Pick a random item anywhere near you. (I'm gonna use a painting in this example to make it more clear)
2. Look at it and think about it for about 5 seconds.
3. Now look at a wall, and don't allow yourself to think about the painting, tell yourself 'don't look at the painting'. just stare at the wall and do not think about the painting.
- Most probably you can't stop thinking about the painting simply because you keep telling yourself to not think about the painting. Now try this:
4. Look at the wall again and allow yourself to think about the painting, it's okay if you don't but it's okay too if you do.
- most probably you thought less about the painting or even forget about it entirely, simply because you allow your brain to focus on it if it wants to, or not.

The painting is anxiety. 
The more you tell your brain to not think about something, the more it focuses on that thing, why? Your brain is an asshole.

So whenever you get anxious or get depressed thoughts or anxious thoughts don't tell yourself to stop thinking about it, because at that moment your brain is being irrational. And you can't fight something irrational with a rational arguement. 

Instead just allow yourself to be anxious and just think those thoughts,  eventually, it'll end. It always ends.",3,2014-01-21 01:41:54 EST-0500
321,Does anyone have anxiety that makes them question life?,,15,2014-01-15 01:22:38 EST-0500
322,[Relaxing] Just wanted to share my breakthrough with L-Theanine,"I just wanted to say that L-Theanine has changed my life. That sounds really dumb, but I can't think of any other way to describe it. I have ADHD with comorbid GAD and have tried every SSRI and benzo's. They did nothing for my anxiety and benzo's aren't something I'd ever want to consider a long-term solution to anxiety. 

A few weeks ago I took 200mg of L-Theanine before work. Everything about my day became 20X easier to manage. Smiling became easier. Talking to people became easier. I am very prone to panic attacks, but I have most of my triggers nailed down. This has been the biggest thing for me - things that usually trigger panic have stopped triggering it. 

I feel like my personality is finally able to break through the wall of anxiety that holds it back. 

Anyway, after 10 years of fighting with this, I never thought something I could buy over the counter would ever be the solution for me, but it has somehow. Obviously it doesn't work for everyone, but if one other person tries it (after discussing it with their doctor of course) because I wrote this and it works, then it's totally worth it.

323,"I suffer from anxiety, and you know what? It's ok.","I've suffered from anxiety on and off for the last 8 years. My anxiety and panic attacks became progressively worse starting in September of 2013.

I decided to leave my stable, steady, boring job to pursue a dream job. I was anxious,  nervous, and excited, but figured this was normal. During my very short stay at this job, I felt like I was under a lot of pressure. I was making little to no money and pulling 12+ hour days. I ended up having a really bad panic attack one day and couldn't perform. I explained to my manager my situation and I was excused. I went home with tears streaming down my face. I felt battered and bruised. I kept this job for a few more days and came to the conclusion that I wasn't cut out for it, and I left.

So here I was a month later, with no job, no income, and no prospects. From October until the end of December my anxiety and panic attacks sky rocketed. Besides the fact that I didnt have a job, I was also dealing with a lot of other triggers. I had stowed away some medicine, but used it sparingly because I didn't want to run out.

I found myself isolated and depressed, which only made things worse. Finally in late December I landed an interview with a pretty promising company. There were three phases to the interview and I nailed the first two. The final step was an in person interview. I recall having anxiety on my way there and during the interview,  but somehow,  someway, I nailed it.

I got a job offer and was set to start on January 6. It felt like impending doom, time was closing in and I went into full blown panic for several days straight, but the positivity of everything kept me grounded. I focused on the good, I got through the interview, I landed the job, and it seemed to be the perfect environment for me.

The night before my first day I was a wreck. I felt incredibly sick with anxiety. I woke up at 5am, a few hours before my alarm was set to go off and I was in an extremely negative state, my thoughts started spiraling out of control. What if I couldn't do it, what if I panicked, what if I passed out. What if, what if, what if. I drafted an email to my appointed training manager and told him how I felt and that I couldn't make it.

I felt like a failure writing this email and I didn't even send it yet. My girlfriend managed to calm me down and thanks to her I mustered up the courage to go. I took 2.5mg of xanax, which would knock anyone out, but it kept me stable. I made it through my first day and was the most proud I've been in a while. But it wasn't over yet.

Throughout the week I continued to have anxiety, and was popping xanax left and right. During an individual meeting with my training manager I spilled my guts, told him about my anxiety and although he didn't really know what to say, the few words of encouragement he did give me helped a little. I made it through last week.

This past Monday was the start of my second phase of training and I felt the same exact feelings I felt on my first day. I emailed my training manager and explained to him what was going on and then without shame, I emailed my direct manager, a woman who I had never even met and spilled my guts to her as well. I didn't know what to expect, all I knew was that I was tired of hiding. 

She replied to my email, stating that she understood and that we should sit down and have a meeting later in the week. As the time went by, I found myself less anxious and went from taking 1-2mg of xanax a day to none at all. 

I had my meeting with my direct manager on Wednesday and it literally could not have gone any better. She comforted me and told me about how she was recently diagnosed with anxiety and she knows how it feels. I almost wanted to cry, because all this time, I felt so alone, like no one understood what I was going through, and here was someone that was able to completely empathize with me and actually ask me advice about anxiety and coping mechanisms. She assured me that anything she could do to help alleviate some stress and worry she would take care of personally. 

This was Wednesday and since then I have not had an ounce of anxiety,  its almost like it vanished when I verbalized my fears and admitted that I was a slave to my anxious feelings. I'm not saying I'm completely rid of my anxiety,  but hopefully within time it will become manageable again. 

I urge you, not to run away from your anxiety, but to embrace it! I constantly ran away from my feelings and all that happened was that my anxiety became worse. It wasnt until I finally admitted to myself and others; I suffer from anxiety. Say it ""I SUFFER FROM ANXIETY!"" 

If you're reading this, and you feel scared, if you feel alone, I ask you to get those feelings out in whatever way you can.  Cry, scream, breathe, punch a couple of walls, or reach out to someone for support, someone who you can trust. 

 I wanted to share this story with you because I know how detrimental anxiety can be to a person's well being. No one deserves to feel scared and alone. If I can overcome it, you can too. 

Stay strong and breathe. 

TL:DR; I promise you will be ok.

Emotional flashbacks?

I cannot figure out how to make this stop. I am triggered EACH time by these noises, then I am filled with total emotional dread and panic. 

During childhood my parents would frequently argue every week, almost every night. My dad was very a tumultuous, angry person. When my mother was angry she'd throw cups and plates to break them, she'd slam doors and cabinets, she'd throw the dirty dishes into the sink (classical housewife at the time). 

I've tried to peacefully suggest to her to not do this because it triggers me. She continues to do it. Moving out is not an option at this time. ",39,2014-06-03 04:47:39 EDT-0400

329,My #1 Anxiety LPT.,"Hello everybody! Been reading this sub for a while now and thought I would share one of the things that has helped me the most with my anxiety and depression. I am 24 and have had anxiety and major depressive disorder since I was 14, so I have a solid decade worth of experience! Yay.

I have done psychotherapy for four years, and also use an SSRI; this tip is more of a complement to those things, not really a stand-alone solution.

It's pretty simple: get out of the house/apartment/dorm two times each day. Sounds easy, right? Not always. During my darkest bouts of anxiety, I get scared of the world and just sit in a corner of my apartment. But with this rule, I have to at least try to go out twice a day. Once might be for a trip to the coffee shop and post office, then later on for a 20 minute jog. On days that I work, going in to the lab counts as one, then taking an evening bike ride or making a visit to the flower shop counts as another. It's afternoon here right now and I have already been to the cafe, farmer's market, and flower shop, and I am planning a run to a park or a yoga class for the evening.

Anything can count! Laundromat? Great, you got up and got out! Went to the pharmacy for prescription refills and new shampoo? Awesome!  It might sound dumb, but I really think it is a good strategy. Getting outside helps you interact with others and can sometimes make you forgot your anxieties for a few minutes. At the very least, you will get some vitamin D from the sunlight, and that never hurt anybody. You can also make new friends this way.

I live in a nice cozy neighborhood in NYC, so I know it is easier for me than for those of you who might live in rural areas. But just try- even if you are only taking the dog for a walk around the house.

Hope this helps some of you!",19,2014-06-01 22:47:38 EDT-0400

It could be remembering a really stupid joke I made that failed to the audience...or remembering an occasion I may have said something offensive and not realized it.

336,I think there's something seriously wrong with the way my brain works. (Long post),"I'm different.
Not necessarily in a good way.
	
I overreact to making mistakes, assuming that the worst will happen. Sometimes I obsessively think about bad things happening to me and start chasing those bad thoughts until I'm exhausted from thinking & crying. Sometimes my head feels wrong, like my brain is trying to hurt me. I can feel the anxiety pouring out of my brain in chemicals, but I don't know how to distract myself from it. I worry when I notice strangers looking at me, so I've just started not looking anyone in the eye. I like my clothes and know they make me more comfortable, but I constantly worry that I look strange. I'm always worried that people can see my thoughts are different. That I'm scared or uncomfortable. Sometimes I second guess things that are real. I find myself worrying about how true something is, or if something is really there or if I'm actually dead or in a coma at that very moment. I want this traffic jam in my head to stop completely but I don't have any idea how.

I can't concentrate on anything. Not even videogames anymore. I can't sit down with something & do it for hours except reddit, which only encourages you to continually entertain your brain with new information. I rarely finish books. I buy clutter all the time and it's all taken over my room. It's so disorganized in here that it's almost distracting. I want to clean it but I feel powerless. I don't know why. It's like a reflection of what's in my head and I hate it. I haven't completed a videogame in years. Not since Pokemon Platinum, I think, which was about five years ago now. I just spend all my time on reddit. I spend so much time on the computer that I forget to eat. I've always had this problem, even when I was in elementary school. I might be addicted to escaping from my own life, who knows?

I feel so powerless and defeated. Everything in my life is so difficult to deal with and sometimes I think it would be better to just go off alone and never return so I can stop being such a burden to all these people who love me. I have no idea why people like me. I guess cause I'm quiet? I don't know. Do they even know anything about me? I try not to talk about myself & my problems, cause I know they don't fucking matter. Who the hell would care about my problems? They can't fix them. Life is so hard. I need to find a better job in order to pay for school so I can get a degree and get a better job so I can make money to take care of myself. 20s sucks. Who the hell would hire me anyway? I love working hard, I really do. It's gratifying in a way that the rest of my life isn't. It's clear cut with clear instructions and rules. But my social skills are so poor that I don't think I could ever get someone to hire me.

I'm afraid of strangers. I'm afraid of being in public. I'm afraid of getting unwanted attention. I'm afraid of being hit on or complimented. Being complimented makes me so uncomfortable most of the time. I'm afraid that I might be rude to someone on accident or somehow embarrass myself. I can barely make orders at fast food places and then I end up embarrassing myself and then my next hour or two is ruined cause all I can think about is how I requested a large when the sandwiches only come in one fucking size. After I'm comfortable in a place around people I have no problem with any of it, but I still find it hard to open up. I'm never going to be  confident enough to ask my closest friends to use third person pronouns with me because I worry they'll belittle me or ask me questions I don't have answers to.

I'm uncomfortable in my own skin. I don't think I'm worth shit. I'm not worth loving or being around or talking to. I don't know why. I've been thinking about it for months and I can't figure it out and it hurts. It all hurts. I feel like if I tell anyone about my problems I'll be made fun of or not taken seriously or belittled or what if I just start crying while I try to tell them about myself? That would be so embarrassing that I just can't do it. I bottle it all up and can't do it. I can't even talk to my therapist about my problems even though I know he just wants to help. I don't think any of this is normal and it scares me. I've put myself into a god damn panic attack just writing all of this down and it hurts it hurts and I can feel my brain screaming and I don't want to stop it because I've never even written all of this out before but at the same time I want it to stop cause it hurts in the weirdest way possible.

I don't know how to fix this and I'm too scared to ask to go to a doctor because my mom would just be like “Really? Do you really need to go to the doctor because I don't have any money. You think you have mental health problems? Isn't that why we got you a therapist? You should stop seeing him is you're not getting better. Yeah, sure, make the appointment yourself, but I'm so unhappy about you asking me for help that I'm just going to rub my indignation in your face for a while. I couldn't care less if you were happy or not because I sure as hell hate my life.”

So. I don't know what to do. I'm just putting all this out there. I guess I'm just looking for opinions and advice. I need help.",11,2014-06-01 09:23:12 EDT-0400

Anyways, It's not always with just my thoughts or my feelings, it's basically with everything. I feel like there's so much to do, and I never know where to start and I feel so overwhelmed, which usually results in me doing nothing or very little of what I actually wanted to  get done, even though I was never really SURE of all of the things I exactly wanted to get done in the first place. It's like my mind is always overwhelmed and never knows what to focus on or what to get done. And this always ends up with me getting screwed over because well... I never accomplished much in general.

On a sort of unrelated note, I always worry that maybe there's nothing actually wrong with me, that im actually alright in the head, and the fact that I dont do much is 100% my fault and a result of my laziness, and I need to stop pitying myself...

342,"Been dealing with a ""Foggy Head"" and aggravated nervous system for 5 years. Here is what I have learned so far. Appreciate any feedback or additional treatment options.","INTRO 

I have been dealing with this ""foggy head"" thing for 5 years.  I have started to piece together what works and what doesn't and I think I am making progress.

PROBLEM

I really think that something happened that has made my nervous system completely over-stimulated, over-sensitized and completely fried. Some trigger (either mental pressure, like an anxiety/panic attack or physical like a workout) that caused my nervous system to freak out and remain out of whack since.

This ""foggy head"" thing has zapped my ability to dream, my motivation to do things, my attention span, my ability to critically think, make choices quickly and make decisions that I am ""at peace with."" I am constantly analyzing, reflecting and re-analyzing.  It has also has taken my ability to be excited and happy about anything (but I still retain Joy, as I think that is spiritual).

I just wanted (and still do) to go back to ""the way I was."" 

Please... in this lifetime!

At first, this completely paralyzed my life. But, at least for the time being, with prayer, this subreddit (knowing I am not alone!) and experimenting (because the Dr's weren't helpful much), I have started to adjust to life with this issue. I will beat this one day.

CAUSE

I'm convinced that the culprit in this plot is my nervous system, caused by anxiety, and that same nervous system makes all of my muscles tighten and my body super tense, including my head and neck.

I have no proof, but I think the muscles are tightening around the nerves in my neck and aggregates the system even further.

Anyway, this ""body-wide tension"" creates a domino affect and causes me to bite down on my teeth. This jaw tightening is what causes the specific muscles in my scalp to tighten even more. 

I truly believe that this head tension is what is causing my mind to think like sludge. I can't think of things quickly and feels like I am in a brain fog. 

As I said, I think anxiety is the root cause. Then the frustration of this whole situation just causes even more anxiety, and it just builds.

SOLUTION

So how do you get the nervous system desensitized? I don't know, but as I stated above, I think anxiety is the cause of all of this (hence me posting here). So as I have tried to identify and reduced my anxiety triggers, that has helped in reducing the nervous system and subsequent tension.

-Therapy. There seems to be a correlation in the high anxiety situation I faced in 2009 (close death in my family) and when all of this started. The anxiety caused irrational fears of things that a therapist/counselor helped me to identify and work through. This had the highest impact on the anxiety itself and was a turning point in my ability to live and fight through this.

-Any physical stimulation, from the pulling out of the scalp, to a pin prick, to a pinch of the skin ANYWHERE on the body, causes my  nerves to calm, the head to clear, and the shoulders and body to relax, temporarily, for that duration.  I think that is why I have seen others say that acupuncture is helpful.

-Caffeine tends to aggravate the nervous system even more.

-Taking Naproxen seems to calm the nerves a little bit and think ""clearly"" for a few hours.

-Having a dentist make a mold to wear and prevent teeth clenching helps to keep the jaw open and helps relax the head muscles a little bit. But this is just treating a symptom and not the root cause of the problem. 

-Reading the book ""Hope and Help for Your Nerves.""  Of anything that I have read anywhere, this has come the closest to describing medically some of the issues I am facing, as well as the some practical solutions to calming the symptoms I was facing.

So that is what I have so far.  Maybe this is helpful to you.  But any feedback or experience from others is helpful to me. Honestly, just typing this has been helpful.

I also have Crohn's Disease, and this seems to have triggered a flair up. We are doing a ledger conversion and it is a three man shop. I am the Director.

I took this job to get away from stress. I have had an anxiety disorder that has put me on disability twice in the last five years. I have two Xanax in my pill caddy in my pocket. I have been carrying them for months. I don't want to take them. I only use the Xanax XR to sleep, but it isn't getting me through the night.

I hate this feeling. I need to rest.


**EDIT**

The auditors left at 3:00 est. They went through two years of books, and found two errors. Not bad, considering I do the accounting, HR, IT, office management and procurement. The company tripled in size since I started, and do to anxiety about losing my job, I wouldn't ask my boss for help. I finally hired an AP clerk and a staff accountant. Of course, I still worry chronically. 

If you never went through an audit, it is always a good idea to let them work through the adjustments before you ask what the adjustment to income will be. Instead, I checked in all day. It was up and down, and so was I. I couldn't eat.

I took a long walk at lunch and the auditors and I spoke when I got back. They were very helpful and told me they would help me spin it to my boss on Monday; that I did an excellent job under difficult condition, that, and I have permanent solutions to fix the problems.

I didn't take the Xanax. I need it to sleep because anxiety is what keeps me awake. Ambien makes me tired and tense, but doesn't let me sleep.

I took this job because I wanted out of the corporate world. I had a corner office on the 52nd floor, and a large staff. Then the panic attacks started. They got so bad, I would lock my office door, not take calls and try and hide. Of course, it cost me my job. I found another, higher paying, higher pressure job. I didn't last a year.

I took this small job at a small company to avoid the pressure of being in upper management, pressure I know I can no longer endure. Also, my Crohn's was raising hell and became extremely hard to manage.

I feel weak when this happens. The panic attacks started around five years ago. I used to thrive under pressure, and now I wilt. I will get through this without a knick, but sitting at your desk, struggling to breath, is not the way I want to live.

I have been in therapy for over seven years. The panic attacks started when I got comfortable enough with her to really start to talk about the childhood sexual and physical abuse I lived through. No repressed memories here. I never forgot.

But suddenly, I started feeling afraid of losing everything. Then my marriage failed, and lost everything. I remarried, and she is wonderful, but I can't relax enough to enjoy our life together.

Right now, I am sitting in the living room with my wife an daughter, watching the tube, and I know, Sunday night, the night before I explain the problems to my boss, I will lay in bed sweating and trying not puke.

I am 51 years old, sober 30 years in AA, have three degrees and feel like a total asswipe most of the time. Even when my career was successful, I always thought that if any of my team could look into my mind, they would be shocked at how much of what they saw was a facade.

344,[rant] I'm so angry at myself,"I get myself psyched up for this party tonight. It's a low-pressure event; lots of people whose opinions I don't really care about and a focus on good conversation and cheap wine rather than intense boozing and a trip into town. I get dressed up and put on make up, and suddenly it hits and now I'm in a comfort hoodie and crying. I DON'T GET IT. 

I don't get how I used to be so good at things like speaking in front of crowds, and paradoxically shit at all social events. Now even my eloquence and confidence in front of strangers or those who I don't care about has gone, and I'm just unable to function.

I wish people would stop inviting me to things. 

Lately even the slightest obligation has been stressing me out to the point that I just won't go through with it. Over the last few years I've developed a reputation as a flake and I *hate it*. I hate that people still bother to try to contact me and attempt to meet up and do things when 90% of the time I'll just bail. I would rather no one cared anymore than I kept on disappointing people all the time. 

I hate being me. 

I'm sorry for the zero-positivity rant, it's just. You have days when you do okay and show up to work and stop apologising every time you have to start a conversation and don't fumble your words too badly, and you think you're getting better. And then there are days like these when even leaving the fucking house is just not even an option. Ugh.",13,2014-06-03 22:57:31 EDT-0400

346,My anxiety is stopping me from getting a job,"I applied to numerous jobs and got a call back from four of them. I scheduled interviews at all four. I ended up canceling two of them because I could see myself actually working the job but I was excited for the other two. I drove myself to the interview and then I just couldn't bring myself to get out of the car so I sat in the car and missed my interview then drove home and lied to my mom and said it went fine. I've had a couple jobs before and gone through the process but the last interview I went to went really bad and even though I still got hired I've had intense anxiety about going to another interview since then. 

Does anyone have any tips on getting over this anxiety and being more prepared for interviews? My biggest problem is I'm afraid they will ask a question and I won't have an answer and will just sit there in awkward silence :(",11,2014-06-06 06:13:47 EDT-0400
347,My mom is surprising me with a car. I used to want it but now I don't.,"First of all, I feel SO ungrateful. My mother is getting a new car and surprising me with her old car. (My boyfriend told me. I'm glad because I hate surprises.) I'm scared to take public transportation and there's no where to work in walking distance so this car will mean I can finally get a job and start my life as an adult. 

I got my permit on my 16th birthday and I'm going to be turning 20 in September. I got my licence when I was 17. The problem is that I rarely drove because mom only had one car and she always had it and rarely let me borrow it. If she did let me drive it was at night and only to bring my boyfriend home or get coffee. She's been letting me drive a little more (I guess since she knows she'll be surprising me soon.) Driving makes me a wreck. Not to the point where I shouldn't be driving. I'm worse once I'm home, oddly enough. 

When on the road I second guess everything I do. I'm always so scared to mess up. I always drive the speed limit and I'm so careful turning. I follow the rules of the road obnoxiously perfect. For example, today I had to take my sister to the doctor. I was making a left at a busy intersection in my city. (I live 15 minutes from Manhattan. So it's crowded and busy.)  There were so many buses and cars going in all different directions. There were a few times I could have probably cut some people off. But I figure it's better safe than sorry and I just inched forward slowly and went when it was all clear. I looked over and some lady on the other side of the road was giving me one of the nastiest looks I've ever seen and shaking her head at me. I'm sorry I don't speed. I'm sorry I stop at stop signs. I'm sorry I wait until it's totally clear to go rather than cut people off. But I don't want to die or get pulled over. 

When I get home I'm always so nervous. Even after I've parked and have been inside safe for a while. I'm always scared the police will knock on my door and take my licence away. (I know that's insane. Please don't laugh.) I feel like I've done something wrong. Part of me feels like I'm not even allowed to drive. 

I feel bad and I feel scared and I feel like I did something wrong. 

I know once this car is officially mine I'll be expected to take myself everywhere. But I'm terrified. 

I sort of want to ask my mom for more driving lessons but they're expensive and I'll feel so embarrassed. 

I'm not a bad driver, honest. I just have anxiety. :/ 

Oh, it's also probably worth mentioning that my [abusive] father was a corrections officer and that made me terrified of cops, correction officers, security guards, etc.",40,2014-06-02 23:56:26 EDT-0400
348,Fear of family dying. [Rant],"Anybody else worry way too much about family members dying? This is kind of a new thing for me. 

I've never been under any illusions about the fact that my parents wouldn't live forever, but I always thought it would be a thing I'd have to deal with in my 50s or 60s. 40s at the earliest. Definitely not in my 20s. I'd have a wife, maybe kids of my own, some kind of bedrock under me to make it all easier.

Last September my mother's liver and kidneys started to give out on her. She was 59. She spent the entire fall and most of December slowly dying, though we didn't realize it was that serious at the time. The doctors never made clear exactly how serious it was, but we were under the impression she'd have a few more years, at least, as long as she underwent regular dialysis. Then in late December, one morning she died. 

Firstly, and maybe this is a weird one and I don't know if anybody who hasn't lost a close family member or friend can relate, but a couple weeks before she died I had been visiting and we got in a fight. A stupid, pointless argument that I immediately regretted. She broke down and started crying. She'd been spending a lot of time in the hospital and was more or less confined to her house since the problems had started. She said my father and I were her only friends, and that she didn't want to die. Now that's all I can think about. I worry that I didn't do enough for her in her last weeks. I worry that I made things harder for her than they should have been. I'm worried that I made her life, in general, harder than it should have been. She always teased me about when she was going to get grandchildren, and now she never will. I go back over in my mind everything I can remember ever saying to her, and determine how much pain I might have caused her. Stupid things. Stupid, petty, brief arguments that we quickly moved past, but what if she didn't? What if I unintentionally said something that really hurt her in the last weeks? I can't stop worrying about this, and I don't know if this is my anxiety or what.

On top of that, now I'm also terrified that my father is going to die. I mean, of course he will some day, but he'll be 60 next month and all I can think about is that he'll be gone, too. I'm worried about it when I'm visiting him, or if we go out for lunch, or when I talk to him on the phone. He mentions he has to go get routine blood tests done for the doctor, and I worry about a bad result being returned. I worry every time I know he's driving. Does anybody have any advice on how to move past this? Every time I see him these things are thrust right in front of me, and I hate it. I want that to be over. I want to enjoy the time I have left, however long it is, with my remaining parent.",6,2014-06-05 11:05:23 EDT-0400

352,My coworker openly ranted about me to our entire office while my door was closed. I am dreading everything about work now.,"I had the door to my office closed yesterday morning to focus on my work, because one of my coworkers was carrying on in the main office space like usual. He generally has some complaint that sets him off and he rants at anyone who will listen, and I've been trying very hard to tune him out. It kept on for a while this time though. I work with my SO so I texted him and asked what coworker was on about. 

Apparently he was ranting about me. 

I just started this job 2 months ago and the creation of my position and a couple others brought a slew of changes to this place, and whilst most people have seemed to adjust, this one particular coworker has not. He takes out his frustration on me by purposely not providing info I need, by expecting me to drop everything and handle his requests ASAP, requiring perfection on my part while not providing the tools for success. He has yelled at me in front of a client, he has also belittled me on the phone to another client. This is a daily occurrence.

Yesterday, in front of all of our coworkers, he let it all out to our office manager. About how I'm not like the previous person who was in my chair, in fact I'm the exact opposite. That I am horrible at budgeting my time. That none of his clients are ever happy with my work. And that I personally have cost him nearly $10,000 worth of sales this year.  

I called my boss (who works in the next town over) and told her about it, then packed up my work and had my SO take me home. Everyone just assumed I was sick, how could they not know after witnessing that garbage though?

I don't want to face *anybody* today. I've been at work since 5:45a just to get everything done so I can peace out again this morning as soon as I'm able to. I'm not sure how to go forward from here. 

The worst part is that I'm actually pretty good at my job, and I *do* keep his clients happy whilst somehow putting up with all of his requests. I have no idea what to do. ",30,2014-11-04 19:19:43 EST-0500

354,"My dog just died. It's messed me up real bad. (tl;dr, sorry)","[Quick backstory with pictures](http://imgur.com/a/OCc1q) because I don't feel like repeating the story anymore.

So if you went through that, the story ends with this, they cut him open and then had an ""Oh shit"" moment when they realized it was far worse than the ultrasound showed. That morning we never thought it would be anything worse than a two night stay at the hospital. We ended up with a dead dog. The infection had returned but this time was much closer to his bloodstream, and they couldn't remove it like before without taking out 80% of his colon. No dog can survive that. He was already half of what he should of weighed. 

We couldn't even let him wake up to pay our last goodbyes. They said it would have been far more merciful to euthanize him while he was still under anesthesia otherwise he'd wake up in a lot of pain from the surgery. Worst phone call ever. 

---

It's been almost two days. He died around 3 PM on the fifth. You know, the thing about this dog is, he loved being around everyone. Giant Schnauzers are reserved by nature, but he was definitely less so than most and after he'd made sure you weren't a ""threat"" which consisted of just a second of barking and then a liiiittle bit of sniffing, he would stick to you like wet cement and follow you around everywhere. It was adorable and maybe a bit annoying at times but in the best way possible. He also loved to please people and give them so much love. 

I'm an introvert probably part by nature and part due to my condition. So I preferred a tight circle of small but well-bonded friends, although at times it did get lonely and I was still prone to many moments of severe hopelessness and feeling worthless (still get those, all the goddamn time). He knew, and was always there to be by my side and comfort me. I've long since recanted my faith but at the time I said he was a true gift from God. That he changed my life. He was my best friend and the best dog my family ever had and we've had eight dogs over a period of maybe 25 years. 

He always wanted to be pet. Always made you feel loved and worth something. He was the sweetest boy. And not even three years old when he died. His (very rare variation, I might add) condition was so severe by the time it was finally diagnosed and the full severity of it realized, literally on his deathbed, there would have been no point in trying to keep him alive even if the infection site had been somewhere far less dangerous. He would just have gotten it again and again and again and died to it anyway even if we followed his every single movement and diet intake like an eternal hawk.

---

Since then, I've plunged and hit the grieving process perhaps harder than normal people (however they can actually be referred to...). I didn't cry after the first day, but yesterday I did have a moment where my eyes momentarily filled up in tears during a Skype session with my SO. But... I've all but shut down inside. I don't sleep... I had to take 5mg of melatonin to go with my night pills plus the Xanax I'm weaning off of to even sleep, and then I overslept because of the melatonin and woke up feeling numb and shitty after a dream of my dog being alive and well in the garden. 

I don't talk to anyone. Even conversations with my own two parents tend to be short lived. I comfort my mom and she's been crying far more and harder than everyone else which is distressing... she wants him to be alive so badly as we all do. I've stopped being as open with my (LDR) SO of over 5 months, and we had very open communication before my dog died. I think he thinks he's partially to blame because I don't talk much to him anymore and my replies are often distanced and short. I wish I could work up the energy to write long and heartfelt messages about how that's not true as I usually do, and I didn't mind one bit because I knew it was the right thing to do and I liked doing that, but now... I just feel so dead inside that no emotions are ever truly evoked anymore for maybe more than a moment or two. If he reads this: It's not your fault. At all. I promise you this, always and forever.

I feel like an even emptier husk of my former self. I stopped eating as much and I already ate little before. I feel anxiety creep up on me now more than ever before, and then that crushing and sinking feeling of utter, muted grief and misery non-stop. I keep remembering my mom getting that phone call about him dying and her bursting in tears, red-faced and saying, ""They say Thor isn't going to live!"" like a horrific scene out of a Sarah McLachlan ad, on an endless and nightmarish loop. Again and again. 

I've been up for almost 20 hours and I don't feel tired at all. Bits of my mind would rather I kill myself than let this go on. But the truth is, I never, ever go through with suicide. In fact, I might toy with the thought sometimes but I don't ever plan it out, not one bit. Because... I always want to know whether it'll get better. It got better, when I first got properly diagnosed by a then-new doctor and put on appropriate medication. Then it took another nose dive. Again and again with me failing college and coming home. Then I met my SO. Cue getting better. Then Thor died. Nose dive basically the distance of the summit of Mt Everest to the ground.

I don't know if it'll ever get better, but I'm far too indecisive and inquisitive to let that doubt stop me, oddly enough I let every fucking thing else in my life stop me. I give up a lot and have zero self worth. But I'm still fighting and that's not going to end. 

But it'd sure be a huge help if Thor was healthy and alive. RIP....

357,"Bad news, mass in wife's chest. I can't sleep, can't eat, can't think. She's dealing better than me.","Like the title said, I'm a mess due to anxiety about a mass that is rapidly growing in my wife's chest. The doctors don't know what it is yet but they think two things are most likely; either it's an extremely rare genetic connective tissue disorder, or it's an aggressive sarcoma. Both of these are bad news, but obviously sarcoma is truly terrible. Since learning this I've been unable to eat more than a few bites, sleep more than a few minutes at a time, or even think about anything else. My stomach hurts all the time and my guts are constantly purging themselves any way they can. All of my usual techniques for dealing with anxiety are proving completely useless. I need to keep it together because she needs me to help her out more than ever. I worry about the kids, I worry about how their lives will be impacted by this. Even if it's the best possible news and it's the genetic disorder, it's still very bad news because it means she will have these large masses growing and causing her more pain all her life, basically making her a complete invalid. But I can't seem to even hope that this is what it is. My brain keeps saying, ""You know it's cancer."" It's times like this when I really wish I could believe in a higher power and that I could just pray the problem away.

I have been through death before. I've been through life changes before. But she is truly the love of my life and so much more. If she were to die, my stepson would go to live with his dad who barely knows him. So not only would I lose my wife, but my son, too. And my stepson would lose the only family he really knows (myself, his mom, and two sisters) and have it replaced by an absent biological father who doesn't even love him and a new stepmother who already resents him. And legally there is nothing I could do to stop this.

I'm too tired to think straight and my mind just keeps going back to the worst case scenario because that's the only one that's plausible. It's like my brain literally will not allow me to accept the possibility that this might turn out okay somehow. I think I need to find a decent counselor to help me deal with this, but our doctor bills are already too high as it is. FML.

My wife, by comparison, is obviously worried, but she is still able to smile, and laugh, and so forth. I just don't know how people deal with this sort of thing. What is their secret? I wish I could just turn off the mental anguish.",34,2014-11-06 18:00:08 EST-0500

362,My Generalized Anxiety follows me everywhere,"I really don't know what posting about this on here is going to do, but I'm trying anyway.

I've had Generalized Anxiety for as long as I can remember. I'm 21 (M) now, but as a child, all the way through school, and presently, my anxiety is and has been so bad that I've found it nearly impossible to function as a normal person. The worst part about it is that my anxiety and stress does not and has not ever gone away, even for a split second. I'm completely and totally exhausted because I honestly do not know what it feels like to be relaxed. I want, more than anything in the entire world, to simply be able to be comfortable. Even when I'm alone in my bed, I'm just stressed out of my mind.

I don't have panic attacks or have my anxiety triggered by anything because it's already there in the first place. It never goes away. I can't even seem to understand what it is that I'm stressed or anxious about. I'm not particularly worried about anything, I don't have an irrational fear of people or going outside or anything like that, I'm simply tremendously uncomfortable at all times.

I've gone to various doctors and gone through numerous medications to no avail. I've also gone to a therapist, and that had no outcome other than strengthening my preconception that talking to a random person that happens to have a degree in the same way that I've talked to dozens of others in the past wouldn't do anything for me.

I really don't know what to do anymore. I'm totally exhausted as a result of my discomfort, and I'm fairly certain that there's nothing that can help me other than finding a way to overcome it in my own mind which, as I'm sure most of you in this subreddit know, can be nearly impossible for someone in this situation.

364,[Rant] The root of my insecurity is an aversion to being seen as a failure by my perfectionist father.,"I feel like out of anybody in my family, I'm the most acutely aware of the passive aggressive ways that my dad displays his perfectionism. On a surface level he's kind and generous, but behind it I can always tell when things aren't going the way he thinks they ""should"" be going. At the same time, he pours undue praise on me on an almost consistent basis. I think in a sense he means to be compassionate, but in my head it just means he sees me in a way that is disconnected from reality.


I can't live up to the perfect version of me that he sees, so I disconnect myself from reality toward a feeling of self hatred. I never let myself fully live in the moment, and I avoid high risk situations while letting my life degrade because my stress problems were never really noticed by my dad. Some of my worst memories, and really the reason I try not to remember my childhood is the way he behaved when teaching me to ride my bike. I was a bit slow to learn it and when I failed he berated me until I cried. So yeah, I really try to distance myself from family because of that. I have a serious trust problem with the closest people in my life because I fear that type of treatment.

366,"Feeling extremely lonely, but unable to meet new people.","Hey, first time posting so sorry if my thoughts are a bit jumbled.

I'm currently going through one of the most lonely periods I've ever experienced in my life. I'm currently studying at university, 20 years old, male, and when I started university I had a fair few friends who I could mutually rely on for fun, support and general happiness. Over the last couple of years we've all kind of separated, they've all gone their own way, they've jumped into relationships or made friends with different groups of people.

I've always found it extremely tough to talk to new people. I don't know what to talk about with them. I've never fully grasped the idea of bonding with someone when you have NO idea what they're into, what they're like, how they are as a person... normally I get a few minutes into the conversation, start panicking that I'm making a poor first impression, and high-tail it out of there before I fuck up. I used to be able to talk to people quite freely at parties (alcohol enabling me to become more confident/re-assured) but for the last half a year I've spent most parties lingering in the corner quietly drinking while everyone else does their own thing. It doesn't help that my crippling self confidence with my body leaves me feeling horribly aware of how unattractive I must seem to other people while talking to them.

At the moment I have one friend. And he's dealing with diagnosed depression, so he has his own issues to deal with; it wouldn't be fair for me to force him into hanging out with me 24 hours a day.

I was just wondering if you guys have any advice on just... diving into things and meeting people? Making friends? I'm not even interested in meeting someone who could be more than a friend; I'm just wanting people who I can talk to. People who I can feel comfortable around. People who don't make me feel like I have a lead weight in my stomach while I'm talking to them.

Sorry again if any of this seems inappropriate for the subreddit, I'm just trying to find advice where I can get it.",8,2014-11-03 01:37:01 EST-0500

368,idea: self-acceptance subreddit,"Hi guys. I notice a lot of people here seeking to change or trying to suppress or remove what they're going through. I know for me and a lot of others anxiety comes from a constant feeling of inadequacy compared to other people, which external factors do very little to shift. 

I want to start a subreddit based on self-acceptance, discussing resources and ways in which people are learning to be okay with themselves. I know there are a lot of mental health and improvement subreddits, but many of them focus changing oneself or learning to stop embracing who you are. The closest I think of would be r/meditation, but that already has a very specific focus. 

I would love to hear what people think. I'll probably xpost this to other related subreddits.

380,A friend killed himself last night,"We weren't very close.  He was neighbors with friends who always had me over.  I met him and his wife a decent amount of times.  Sat with him at our friends wedding.

He was a nice guy.  Always quick with a laugh or a joke.  I saw a lot of similarities between us.  I promised him we'd hang out once my work schedule let up in the winter.  

I never knew he had anxiety.

I've dealt with it myself for years.  

I found out that he was given medication at a doctors appointment that day...I guess he decided there wasn't enough time for it to work.  That's the hardest part of this for me.  There was hope in a bottle...sitting right in front of him.  He was just in such a dark place that there was no way for him to feel he could get out.  I knew that feeling once as well, but suicide was never the answer for me, despite me not wanting to live with the feeling of dread anymore.  Luckily a doctor gave me medicine and it worked for me.  To this day I am doing much better.  

If only he had waited...We could have had more one on one conversations.  I could have helped.  I wish things had gone differently.

385,Does anyone else have anxiety over literally nothing?,"Sometimes at night I just get really anxious for virtually no reason. I have a fear of current events and the potential negative impact they may have on me. I frequently have panic attacks when I read about a current event that scares me. I usually get over it once I read past the sensationalism of the media and understand what the actual problem and most likely outcomes are. However, eventually after having anxiety about lots of different things over the course of a period of time I will just start to feel nervous. There are 7 billion people on this planet and there will always be something scary going on, I understand that. Still, I can't help but check the news every few minutes. I feel like I'm trying to find something to panic about. This isn't really a problem as much as a nuisance as it never really continues past one or two nights and I move on with my life. 

Here's basically my process of anxiety:

1. Something scares the living sh*t out of me
2. I worry about that for like a month
3. I find inner peace and understand I can't do anything about it
4. During my recovery process, I usually find other things to give me anxiety about. I slowly get over all of those things.
5. A week goes by and they slowly creep back into my mind and lose my inner peace and have mild panic attacks at night a lot.
6. Eventually I finally move on and regain inner peace and live my life.

This always happens in the fall for some reason and ends by usually mid-December. I feel like my anxiety makes an itinerary every year and if I don't feel anxious during a time I'm scheduled to then it'll give me something to worry about. Right now I'm experiencing step 5. Does this happen to anyone else? Is there any recommendations you have to make this process shorter or less stressful?",13,2014-12-12 05:27:38 EST-0500

I always want the last word but I never want the last word.

I have honestly never felt so out of control with this stuff before. I know why I feel like this at the moment and that this feeling crazy is a symptom of other things rather than the cause, but trying to combat something totally irrational with something completely rational isn't working.

I felt like I could never find the right thing to say and I always felt surprised and off-guard when social encounter would unfold suddenly.  This caused a lot of dread and anxiety about social situations.

However, a couple months back I was diagnosed with ADD due to my troubles with concentrating in the harsh environment of university schooling, I was put on Vyvanse and something really interesting things happened.

All of a sudden social situations were manageable, I could predict the flow of conversation and really engage with the dialogue.  I didn't lose my trains of thought, I was able to make coherent thought out responses and since then I have begun to relish and seek out social situations, and yes even prosper in them.  I am still somewhat making up a bit of a social deficit from being less socially active than I would have been, had my ADD been treated, but I am rapidly making up lost ground.  I implore you, if my story sounds like you to be evaluated for ADD, I wish I had sooner.  

TL;DR The reason I had social anxiety was not because I had ""anxiety"", but because I have ADD and if left untreated can make it difficult to function in social situation, and thus stress provoking.  ",5,2014-11-16 08:11:17 EST-0500

http://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/2kzshg/help_my_wife_wants_a_divorce_and_despite_all_of/

These days have been horrible - I got home a few days ago and was instantly called crazy, and I finally lost it and told her to shut up or I call the cops. Then she got internet buddies of hers to send me hateful emails. I retaliated in kind through emails - it was way too much pressure and I lost my cool. By losing my cool I mean standing up to her and sternly telling her to shut up. That's it. From a distance of a few metres away. 

I locked myself in the room afterwards. It's been 3 days of her insults, and I had a few breakdowns - took way too much clonazepam on one of those, but just fell asleep and woke up very late, only to sleep again. 

She's flying to the UK on the 27th. It's been over 1 year where I felt emotionally abused and stepped on, and was treated like garbage. And yeah, I still do love her, but I know that she is evil and is just out to cause damage. I would never ever hurt her though - it's not in my nature. What I did do is put a mirror in front of her through emails, so she could see who she is and the damage she caused, preying on the emotionally vulnerable. I was in my room and she was in hers.

Now she found a lawyer for the divorce, and wants me to pay for it, which I won't because I must find another place to live. She'll most likely pay for it herself, but even if she does, I fear a massive breakdown in or before signing that piece of paper. Any advice would be welcome.",9,2014-11-20 22:17:51 EST-0500

I don't expect it to fix me but I at least want to see that I am stronger than my anxiety. 
     I packed my backpack last night and had a small attack. When I laid down for bed and turned out the light I had a major one. I'm terrified. But I don't want to be. Camping and backpacking has been a huge hobby of mine for my entire life and I'm tired of not being able to do it. You all have given me a lot of hope, support, and company through some really bad attacks and I'd love to hear what you think and maybe some encouraging words. 
I love you all and I'll let you know how it goes.",30,2014-03-20 19:13:29 EDT-0400

429,A reminder that all suffering is temporary...,,12,2014-03-15 01:36:55 EDT-0400
430,After eight years I finally went to the doctors... today!,"I'm a man of 38 years old, I knew what was going to happen if I went to the doctors, thus the reason why I never went, it was about appealing as a gas chamber.

I've suffered from anxiety for years, eight years I think, the problem with anxiety is that as you all know, it's such a horrible illness that it stops you seeking help, you'll do ANYTHING just to avoid ONE panic attack, going to the doctors ... LOL .... not a chance, EVER. That is the one place you can't escape from, the one place where you have to be honest and truthful and the one place you'll feel uneasiest, more than likely with a full on panic attack, AND you get the joy of sitting in the waiting room for 10 minutes first!! 

Unfortunately for me, I made a deal with another anxiety sufferer that if she gave up the cigarettes, I'd go to the doctors. 

Today was the day that I HAD to go, phoned at 8am, still in bed, expecting an appointment in the afternoon, Nope, got through at 08:15, only appointment available 08:40!!! I was still in bed! Bath on, raced downstairs and took 400mg of magnesium and a handful of kalms, 1000mg of vitamin C, and an aniseed ball for the sugar, no time for breakfast. Out the bath, ironed jeans, 08:30, this was good, it gave me no time to panic, out the door 08:35, had to run half a mile to the surgery, it sucked, I'm a cyclist not a runner, got there at 08:40.

Sat in the waiting room, gradually becoming more fidgety, anxiety building, sending texts to my friend begging her to chat to me to bring me down, she never got them, holding it together I sat there. I hated it. Next thing I know my names called out. 

I was fine, I had rehearsed what I was going to say. Walked in, shook her hand and happily declared I wasn't contagious.

""Hi, I've had anxiety for eight years"".

She slumped back in her chair and looks concerned. The happy face went instantly. My meltdown started, shaking and voice trembling, she could see I was in distress as I tried desperately to hold it together, It really sucked, but it was a release ... She listened to me, a 38 year old man with tears in my eyes begging for anything to make it stop.

I have very little memory of the consultation, came home with Sertraline and Proprolol.

Moral of the story is, if you have anxiety, you ARE going to your doctors, it really was a shitty experience, but it's your only option to get better. Having a breakdown infront of your doctor allows then to see how serious it is, she looked really concerned for me. Don't know how she did it but when I walked out there was a nurse outside the door, I'm pretty sure she was called because I looked so unwell and on the verge of collapsing. 

Eight years of fun coming to an end. I'm going to get better. :)

431,A Helpful Rule of Thumb for People Who Think They're Going To Die.,"Just remember:

Left side is heart problems. Right side is stroke. If you can feel yourself scratching your arms and legs, you're fine. Periodically check if you're feeling anxious. You're going to be fine twenty minutes from now. That's because if you're scratching yourself, and/or reading this right now, you're freaking out about it. 

Take a few deep breaths, slow ones, and come back. I'll wait. 

...

Okay. Can you feel the scratches on your skin? Don't over-think it. Either you feel it after your hand is gone or you don't. If you can feel, then you're not dying. And if you're not dying, then, you've faced the concept of impending death and lived. And if you've faced the concept of your impending doom once, you can do it again. 

You won't die today. There isn't anything internally wrong.

Take another deep breath.

Exhale slowly. Concentrate on the exhale.

I, myself, have been through this many times for many years. I'm still alive, and you will be, too.

Just keep inhaling and exhaling slowly, for now. 

When you're ready, we'll move on.

....

Okay, now that you're ready to move on, think about what you want to do. What makes you comfortable? If it's surfing reddit, get on that. Social contact? Get a hold of someone. You've found your center, and now it's time to stabilize. Let's just find the thing that gets you where you need to be, alright?

...

If you're still reading, you didn't find your calm. That's okay. Sometimes it's not so easy to nail down what kills that attack. Sometimes, it seems like there's nothing that can stop your imminent death. I know how that goes. 

At this point, what works for me is *actively* trying to distract myself, but when I think about it, I check all of my limbs to make sure I can feel them. If I can feel my limbs, I'm not having a heart attack, I'm not having a stroke, I would have felt an embolism beforehand with a persistent generalized pain over more than a week, and I'm not smelling blood or anything burning. 

...

There are a lot of things *I* do when I have an attack that may or may not help others. I just wanted to jump in and let others know that *you are not going to die*. Your body is just freaking out either because you're thinking too much about it's functions or, like me, it's just gone haywire and you have this unshakable feeling that you're going to die.

If you're still here reading this, then, you're preparing for an attack, or nothing has worked so far. This isn't a last resort, so much as it is a ""bodily reset"" sort of thing.

**Breathe deeply three times. On the fourth time, tense all of your muscles. Hold your breath and your muscles for a count of four or five. The count to hold is up to you. After this count is up, release your muscles and exhale slowly. Repeat this as often as you need to.**

For me, my doctor says it's a misfire of my ""fight-or-flight"" response, so I get super-stressed. Tensing and releasing muscles can help that.

Okay. I've rambled. I'm sure a lot of this has been covered before here. Just remember, take a few deep breaths, and, actually, even IF you were going to die (which you won't, trust me) John Coyne is probably a good dude to relax to if you're going to go out due to stress :)",14,2014-03-15 16:05:02 EDT-0400

433,"Is it ""ethical"" to abandon a friend if they're a risk for your mental health?","About two years ago, an old friend of mine ""re-emerged"" after fighting an eating disorder for about 8 years. She had been in and out of hospitals, and lost touch with a lot of people. It has been great seeing her and talking with her again, especially since I was diagnosed with Anxiety and Depression during the time she was gone. It's nice to have someone who struggles with similar things to talk to.

Here's the problem: she fishes for people to tell her that she is beautiful. Some examples are complaining that people are calling her fat and asking if she is pregnant, something no reasonable person would ask someone who is 110 lbs. She talks about how upset she is with the weight she gained before summer and it takes every mental tool I've gathered to not cry, scream, or just hit her. 

I understand that her thoughts are like mine, something that she cannot control and something that she struggles with everyday. I've tried to reach out to her and talk about the tools I have gathered and how to use them, but she is unwilling to listen.

I'm at a make or break point - what should I do?

P.S. This is my first time posting to /r/Anxiety and seeing the ""Breathe. Everything's going to end up fine."" and ""Deep breaths. You are okay =)"" put a smile on my face

**Edit:** Thank you so much for your response, they have been incredibly understanding and supportive. It looks like I need to be frank with her about how she affects me and the people around her. If she doesn't improve and/or listen, than I will disconnect and not make the effort to be around her while still responding with kindness if she reaches out to me.

Thank you, again",49,2014-03-16 03:49:15 EDT-0400

439,[Help] Please help me r/anxiety. My marriage fell apart this afternoon. I am going out of my mind.,"My husband has been distant and not himself for the last two weeks. Today we talked about it and he told me that he cares about me as a friend, but that he has stopped loving me.

I am devestated, I have been crying uncontrollably for hours. I am having rolling panic attacks. I can't breathe. I feel that my heart has been broken.

I am so scared of what this means. When we were talking he said he wants to see if we can work on it for a while and see what happens.

We have two young children and I moved with him for his job to the other side of the world from where all our families are.

My body is dumping on me, I am throwing up and and my stomach is upset.

I have to get up in the morning, get the kids to school and go to work. But all I can do at the moment is lay here like a zombie. I am both feeling everything and nothing.

Please, someone help.





**Edit**. So, it is Monday evening. I had to have the day off work as my anxiety was going absolutely crazy and when that happens my body dumps and shuts down. 

He came home from work and started complaining a bit that I had not gone in. I cut that off straight away and told him that he had no right to expect anything from me in this situation, that he had broken my heart, my trust and basically my mind.

He came up stairs to me a while later and told me the he was really upset with himself for hurting me so badly, that he still didn't know what he wanted etc. I told him that I had spoken to my mum and she had helped me to start taking things one at a time, eg, drink some water, eat an apple, phine my Dr and psych. I hadn't eaten in 36 hours so that helped.

I have made a couples appt with my psych for next week. If he wont go, she will see me alone. I have also told a close friend out here what is happening in case I feel I need to get out to talk to someone else.

I have managed to go shopping tonight, I needed to practice getting out the house as I want to go to work tomorrow for some sense of normality in my day.

We both cried a lot ths afternoon, he said he wishes that he had never said anything because of the hurt it has caused. He wanted to just pretend it had ever happened. I told him I wished that I could too, but that he has taken 14 years of love and trust and trampled all over it.

Even if he tells me he loves me once more, am I ever going to be able to believe him?

**Edit** **2** So, it is Wednesday evening now, and also my birthday (yeah, he threw this at me three days before my b'day!) Things are ok here, lots of talking and communicating. He made a real effort today to ask what I wanted to do, and seems to be ok with me not wanting to do much other than have dinner and cake at home with him and the kids. 

Work are being very supportive, especially today, they were very sweet and keep checking in on me! 

Husband bought me a birthday card that he says he took a long time to choose to get the wording right. If I had recieved it last year, I would have cried with delight at what it said about our feelings and relationship. This year I read it over and over, trying to decide if he had just chosen one at random, whether he meant what it said, whether it represented what he really feels. I just can't shake that lack of trust now and it upsets me that this is happening. I want to be able to be completely happy again, but I go through the day and suddenly that conversation comes up in y mind again and all the horrible feelings and negativity come back.

Oh well, counselling in one week today. We shall see what happens next I guess.",37,2014-03-17 06:21:22 EDT-0400

450,Great read for those who know someone with anxiety and those with anxiety. Found it somewhere a long time ago(Can't remember) and it helped me.,"How to Decode a Person With an Anxiety Disorder   
  
Things we are trying to do all the time:  
- be safe    
  
Things we can’t help but do all the time:  
- second-guess ourselves  
- behave impulsively and reactively  
- take everything personally  
- worry  
- have difficulty accepting compliments  
- have difficulty reciprocating friendly gestures  
- worry  
- have difficulty finding the courage to respond  
- have difficulty not being suspicious of others’ intentions  
- worry  
- make a huge deal out of the smallest thing  
- think we're bothering you  
  
Things you should keep in mind:  
- we’re scared of everything  
- pretty much all of the time  
- it’s an actual disorder  
- it manifests as impulsive behavior  
- you can’t fix us with words  
- telling us “worrying is silly” won’t make us stop worrying  
- it’ll only make us feel silly  
- and then we’ll worry even more  
- “oh god, am i worrying too much? what if they call me silly again?”  
- like that  
- also, we wear a lot of armor  
- cold, heavy, affection-proof armor with spikes  
- we constructed this armor as children  
- we’re fairly certain you will never be able to pry it apart  
- but there is a nice person under there, we promise  
  
Things you can do for a friend with an anxiety disorder:  
- stick around  
- ask them if they’re comfortable in a place or situation  
- be willing to change the place or situation if not  
- activities that help them take their mind off of things are good!  
- talk to them even when they might not talk back (they’re probably too afraid to say the wrong thing)  
- try not to take their reactions (or lack thereof) personally (the way they expresses themself is distorted and bent because of their constant fear) (and they know this)  
- give them time to respond to you  
- they will obsess over how they are being interpreted  
- they will anticipate being judged  
- it took me four hours just to type this much  
- even though i sound casual  
- that’s because i have an anxiety disorder  
  
Things you shouldn’t do:  
- tell us not to worry  
- tell us we’ll be fine  
- mistake praise for comfort  
- ask us if we are “getting help”  
- force us to be social  
- force us to do things that trigger us  
- “face your fears” doesn’t always work  
- because—remember—scared of everything  
- in fact, it would be more accurate to say we are scared of the fear itself  
  
Emergency action procedure for panic attacks:  
- be calm  
- be patient  
- don’t be condescending  
- remind us that we’re not “crazy”  
- sit with us  
- ask us to tighten and relax our muscles one by one  
- remind us that we are breathing  
- engage us in a discussion (if we can talk, then we can breathe)  
- if we are having trouble breathing, try getting us to exhale slowly  
- (it will be harder for us to exhale than inhale)  
- (sometimes all it takes is our body to realize it can push the air back out)  
- or breathe through our nose  
- or have us put our hands on our stomach to feel each breath  
- or have us put a hand on your chest and breath with you  
- ask us what needs to change in our environment in order for us to feel safe  
- help us change it  
- usually, just knowing that we have someone on our side willing to fight our scary monsters with us is enough to calm us down  
  
If you have an anxiety disorder:  
- it’s okay.  
- even if you worry that it’s not okay.  
- it’s still okay. it’s okay to be scared. it’s okay to be scared of being scared.  
- you are not crazy. you are not a freak.  
- I know there’s a person under all that armor.  
- and i know you feel isolated because of it.  
- I won’t make you take it off.  
- but know that you are not alone.

451,The three M's of anxiety. (An original essay I wrote in an attempt to understand my own anxiety).,"If I was asked to define my own anxiety and how it affects my life. I would put it under 3 seperate headings.

**The Maneuver**

**The Movie Theatre**

**The Maggots**

The three M's of Anxiety. To me anxiety doesn't simply translate to worrying about something. If there is something worth worrying about then it is normal to worry about it. To me anxiety is fretting about things that are not worth worrying about. It is also translated from our minds to our actions.

 These three M's are products of my anxiety. And I will explain them each now.

**The Maneuver.**

The maneuver is the name I have given to the minor actions I sub conciously commit in my day to day life as a result of my anxiety. 

They are as simple as crossing the road to avoid talking to someone, or ducking into the bathroom the avoid passing a co worker. small acts resulted form an irrational fear of human contact.
 
But the Maneuver can also mean a lack of action. Refusing to speak up for fear your words will not be heard. Afraid to make eye contact because of a past acts you're afraid will haunt you today. The maneuver is a momentary decision you make that steams from an irrational voice that makes your bodies actions faster then its reasoning. 

If you have a legitimate reason to avoid someone or something, that is not the maneuver. That is logic and reason. The maneuver results from a lack of reason, instead it is an instinct, a split second reaction you make in the moment. One that leaves you feeling stupid and ashamed afterwards, because you realise, just how illogical it is. But you can't help it.

While the Maneuver is featured in the present. What about the past and future? 

**The Movie Theatre.**

The movie theatre is featured in the grand screen of the mind. There are many different features in the movie theatre.

There is the Classic flick. A memory from the past you repeat over and over again in your mind. A conversation you just walked away from, yet you replay it again and again. That one joke you said that got a laugh, or the joke you made that was met with silence. Either way you repeat it in your mind again and agan and again, analyzing every minor syllable and reaction from everyone there, even though they have already probably forgotten the conversation even existed.

Then there is the Fantasy, imagining what has yet to come. This can be a product of the classic clip. Replaying a conversation, thinking about how it COULD have went. Kicking yourself for not being the witty, charming individual you could have been. Or fantasising about the future. A telephone conversation you are practicing in your head, the one you've been meaning to make for hours but have been putting off, mentally preparing yourself for.

Or the horror movie. The worrying about something that is coming up. Playing the worst case scenario out in your head, until you believe it is real, that it is going to happen. Or the other way around. Remembering an incident of shame or humiliation, over analyzing and distorting the memory until it is no longer the same memory, but a exaggerated farce you force yourself to believe.  The horror movie is the worst one to watch, because you start to doubt if it is real or not. 

The Maneuver and the Movie Theater can be products of stable, or unstable minds. Even people who don't  suffer from chronic anxiety can suffer from these. But the difference between someone with and without anxiety comes next.

**The Maggots**

This is the worst product of anxiety. When there is an issue that consumes your mind to the point you cannot escape it. It has become an impossible prison that it eating at you from the inside out.

It doesn't matter if it is a huge problem or an insignificant one. In your eyes, they are equally terrifying. You can feel a pain in your head from the stress, as though there a physical maggots devouring your brain. They are devouring confidence, devouring logic, devouring reason. You cannot function, you cannot concentrate. The world is collapsing around you. You want to bash your own head open and pull the maggots straight out of your brain just to stop the pain. 

The maggots will cost you your sleep, your friends, your job, your self-respect, your sanity, your life. They leave scars on your mind that cannot be healed. They can hit when you least expect it and there is nothing you can do to stop them once they attack. 

You can call this an anxiety attack, a panic attack, depression, stress, insomnia or any number of terms. They can last for minutes, hours or days. They can drive you to tears, a bed ridden numbness, mental break downs and even suicide. The maggots are one of the most dangerous, self destructive weapons your mind will ever manufacture.
____________________________________________________________________________________
I know alot of people will not agree with these analogies, as they are all personal to me. I also know there is more to anxiety then I have mentioned above, but to me, these are the three biggest hurdles I must over come in my quest to conquer my own anxiety. 
I apologize if anyone thinks I am over simplfying a complex issue and for my terrible spelling and grammer. These are my own ideas I have concocted in an attempt to understand my own mind. Let me know if you feel the same, or have anything to add.

Thanks for reading. I wish you all good mental health.

**EDIT**

Hi guys, I'm glad to see alot of you can empathise with the aspects I've listed above. The only advice I can currently give, is being able to recognise when you are feeling one of these emotions. You need to be self aware when you are pulling a maneuver or watching the Movie Theater. Once you realise what you are feeling is a product of anxiety and not reason, you can actively prevent it. Do the opposite of what your instinct tells you, weather it works out well or not, it doesn't matter. What matters is you are not letting your anxiety control you.

This advice bodes for the Maneuver and the Movie Theater. The Maggots are much different, if not nearly impossible to deal with. The only way I can think of to stop the maggots is proventing them from starting. You need to recognise the signs, avoid stress and seek professional help. I wish I could give a quick fix for them, but if I could, I probably wouldn't even be on this subreddit myself.

Thanks again guys. Good luck.",17,2014-06-19 01:18:58 EDT-0400

456,Complete meltdown last night,"I have Crohn's Disease and neuropathy in my feet. Both are aggravated by stress and anxiety.

We are leaving for a cruise on Friday. My boss demanded contact information and wants me to check in once a day. This cruise was to get away from work. Work is backed up. 

I come back for four days, and then I have a week with my daughter.

Last night, I got three hours of sleep, and not three hours in a row. My feet felt like I had them in a fire. Intrusive thoughts spiraled out of control. I felt nauseous all night, and had to use the bathroom seven times.

I can't take much more of this. I am seeing my therapist tonight. I am talking to her about permanent disability. 

Last night, I had suicidal thoughts all night. Planning thoughts. And then I'd think, ""I can't mention this to my wife. She is looking forward to the cruise.""

I feel pressure on all sides, and it is awful. I feel pressure to produce at work, pressure to let my wife have fun, pressure to pay my huge alimony commitment, pressure to manage my Crohn's (which interferes with my work) and pressure to survive.

I have lost my last two jobs because of Crohn's and panic attacks. I am 51, and I am thinking about throwing in the towel.

I fucking hate life so much. But I have a mentally retarded daughter, and the thought of her calling for me, and me not being there actually makes me cry.

I am so fucked up, if I was a project at work, I'd say, ""tear it down and start over. You aren't going anywhere with what you got.""",11,2014-06-17 15:45:16 EDT-0400

So I texted my counsellor hoping for words of advice and she simply told me it was my ego and if I don't fight against it, nothing will change. So I did. I got showered, dressed, did my make up, went downstairs, socialized, met new people, talked about life, had cake. And I had a good fucking time. ",8,2014-06-15 17:10:47 EDT-0400

462,Has anyone experienced binge eating as a result of taking SSRI's?,"I am currently on Lexapro for the first time and it has done wonders for my general mood, my ability to handle stress and for reducing my anxiety levels. 

For context, I have been on the drug for about one month now and I am also on the pill. I am approximately 130lbs at about 5'6 and I have previously lost about 60 pounds, so I am well aware of dieting, being strong with cravings and sticking to healthy eating plans. 

HOWEVER, I have found my appetite to be out of control and my ability to self-control my binging completely non existent. For example, tonight I ate a double portion of stir fry, half a family block of chocolate, a quarter of a jar of Nutella, half a carton of ice-cream, a quarter of a jar of peanut butter, nuts, dates, yoghurt, granola, chips and more chocolate. I have literally eaten to the point of nearly throwing up and this has happened a few times since starting on the drug (about three of four times).

It's as if my brain doesn't listen to me anymore. I keep on telling myself to stop but I just can't. I just feel permanently unsatisfied. Not necessarily hungry, mostly unsatisfied. It is even to the point where I will go through an entire packet of gum each day because I can't control my need to chew or eat something. 

Has anyone else had a similar experience? I am wanting to contact my doctor about this as it concerns me to be so erratic with my nutrition, especially as I have a propensity to put on weight due to my PCOS. The results of my binging also means that I have diarrhoea the following day, nausea and depression. 

Edit: I forgot to mention that I have also been waking up at 2am, starving to the point of feeling nauseated and having to eat lots just to go back to sleep. This concerns me the most as even sleep seems to cower down to my appetite at the moment! 

FURTHER EDIT: SO I talked to my doctor this morning and while she acknowledged that binge eating/weight gain is uncommon on Lexapro, she was more than happy to have a chat to me and to try some other medications. She's reduced me to half a pill until Monday morning, so that I can slightly wean myself off the drug prior to seeing her. What's concerning (and I didn't tell her this as I don't want to seem like a hypochondriac) is that I've woken up with a large lump on my neck. It feels like one swollen gland but its large enough to be quite visible. Let's hope this bump goes down aye?!

463,I was having a horrible week,"I was having a horrible week. My anxiety was through the roof. Haven't slept in 30 hours and couldn't stop shaking, had to work a 10 hour shift on no sleep and was feeling like complete shit. Friends were having a party and I really didn't want to interact with anyone from how shitty I was feeling. BUT, I decided after my long day I work I would stop be the party to say hi then go home and wallow in self pity. I ended up staying until the party ended and get drunk with my friends. I had a wonderful time and had tons of laughs. I got to the party in a horrible mood and not wanting to hug anyone. Got some liquid confidence in me and was ecstatic. While I don't drink often I'm so glad I stayed. My week just got so much better. Started my day with no sleep and emptiness in my heart, ended it with a smile and laughs. Sometimes you just gotta sit down and drink with your friends.

469,[Success] I confronted a panic attack for the first time!,"A lot of my panic attacks paralyze me with fear.  I wind up curled in bed, crying, wishing the world would go away.  It's gotten worse lately as I just restarted therapy and we're in the ""Gets worse before it gets better"" stage.

So this morning, for no reason I can figure out, my brain started telling me what a shitty older sister I am.  When we were growing up, I protected my little brother and helped him not grow up like our shitty father (Family issues, amiright?).  We're in our 20's now, and have separate lives but stay in touch.  I started feeling like I'm not there anymore and that he secretly resents me for not being there since I went to college / embarked on my career(s).  Basic ""i'm a shitty person"" kinda stuff.

So today I saw 3 options:  I can call into work and stay cocooned in my bedroom, I can go to work and hope it subsides, or I can text him and ask him.

For the first time ever, I was brave enough to choose option 3.  I started it by telling him that I know it might come off as stupid or selfish and I""m sorry if it does, but it's just me panicking about the uncertainty.  I told him I felt shitty about not being there for him after leaving home and wanted to know if we were still ok.  I was crying as I texted him, but I didn't tell him that.

He told me he wants to do more with me, but he's just broke and trying to figure out his own post-college life.  He said that, no matter what, we will always be good and that our relationship is nothing I should ever need to worry about.  He was reassuring, in his own quiet way.

Immediately, my panic attack subsided.  I was relieved, and a little tired - it was like a gigantic weight off me.  I'm so happy I did that and that he doesn't hate me.  It's been a recurring thing for months for me.  And I'm glad I did it by text, as if the thoughts reoccur I can go back and re-read that message.

I just wanted to share here because you guys have always been wonderful when I need support for my panic attacks.  

Also, for those too poor for a therapist, if you're in a college area new graduate therapists provide 6 months of therapy for free as interns.  I just learned this, and the woman that was recommended to me has been phenomenal so far.  If you're in a similar position, this may be a great resource to take advantage of.",4,2014-06-19 21:08:58 EDT-0400

I made it 3 shifts in and then this morning I felt like the world was coming to an end so I called them up and explained that I wasn't cut out for the position.  I asked the grocery manager if there was something more task-oriented(as opposed to customer service) available and that obviously didn't go over well.

The Starbucks manager seemed understanding (she had thought it was her who was making me nervous) but there's no way my family is going to think I'm anything other than ""sensitive"" and/or ""lazy"", so I'm just telling everyone I got fired.

472,overwhelmed with little tasks leads to thinking I'll never be able to accomplish anything big in life [rant],"I got back on anti-depressants last week (after a few years of being off) because I was having a really bad depression/anxiety episode for months. I had a good day two days ago, but my anxiety is still looming over me.

I work from home (I'm a crafter/artist) and am finding it incredibly difficult to stay on task because of little things that pop up; having to re-order work supplies, dog has fleas, laundry, cooking, etc.

My mind keeps adding up all the small things I have to do and I feel very overwhelmed. Then I start thinking of the future and things I hope to accomplish down the line (more successful career/great mother/wife/etc.) and I can't imagine ever being able to accomplish these things if I can't even do the laundry.

I'm taking it slow and completing small tasks, but as soon as I finish one thing I immediately start thinking of the things I haven't finished yet. I have an amazing husband who is willing to do anything and everything to help, but I feel bad when he comes home from working all day to even more work, when I could have easily taken care of it myself if I wasn't such a mess.

I keep putting off making an appointment with a psychologist because I have no insurance (but I do have savings to use), and having to get back into therapy makes my heart hurt.

TL;DR: Everyday tasks seem overwhelming which leads to stressing out about the future and I'm avoiding making an appointment with a psychologist because I'm an idiot.",4,2014-06-21 01:58:34 EDT-0400
473,My mom got me a car UPDATE! (This is actually a pretty positive post!),"Hey guys. This might be my first positive post on this subreddit! 

I know someone asked for an update and pictures of my car. Sorry it took so long to deliver! Turns out the tree I park next to grows bird berries and my car is always covered in them. I just got back from taking it to the car wash. (The car was was a little hard for me because I was scared to ""mess up"" and not get in or out at the right time or ask for the wrong package. But I had my sister with me.) So here is a picture: http://i.imgur.com/nKhmPj6.jpg (Sorry about the white bars. I uploaded it to Instagram too!) 

As far as how I'm feeling about driving goes, I'm a little better. The feeling of ""Oh. My. Gosh. I did something wrong!"" when I get home from driving is almost 100% gone. I only sort of 2nd guess everything I did once. Like, instead of being terrified for hours I reply the drive once in my head and make sure I didn't do anything wrong. Still not perfect, but it's better. I'm a bit more comfortable on the road too. I've driven by myself a few more times. I'm still a little too scared to go to new or very busy places alone. I'm going to try to pick my boyfriend up from work tonight. I drove it a few night ago with my sister. I can picture the drive perfectly in my head. This will be the first time going alone. I drove to two out of the tree busiest ""hang out places"" in our area. I was scared. I could tell some people thought I couldn't drive. But I did okay. 

I'm still scared of the police but I'm starting to think things related to my PTSD will just never go away. I was actually watching the show Cops on TV the other night. Some guy got pulled over and he was super nervous. The officer said the guy was ""scaring him"" (the guy really wasn't doing anything wrong!) and he ended up arresting him. So now I'm scared if I get pulled over the cop will see how freaked out I am and arrest me. I should stay away from TV. 

Thank you to everyone who commented last time. You all really helped a lot. I think if it weren't for you guys I probably would have just given my mom the keys back. THANK YOU! THANK YOU! THANK YOU! Internet hugs to all of you!

Edit: My car's name is Oliver. I've been calling him ""Poison Berry"" on account of all the berries that end up all over it. It sounds so badass for my Santa Fe. Haha. ",7,2014-06-21 01:32:02 EDT-0400
474,Anxiety as I knew it ended,"Anxiety was my constant companion from a toddler. I was terrified all the time. I had insomnia at 5 years old in 1985. I started medication and therapy at age 19. Anxiety probably reached critical mass in 2011 but reached a new type of peak in February 2014. I had great doctors. I was doing therapy. I had a medication regime and still I felt awful. Physically and emotionally.  I checked myself into a three day inpatient program. My meds were tapered off. I started sleeping through the night without medication. Four months later I'm off all meds. For the first time in memory,  I'm not anxious. I'm content.  What changed?  Years and years and years of hard work, medication change ups, therapy, groups,  family support and lifestyle changes healed my brain. My life is calmer than it was.  I'm making better decisions. I stopped drinking.  I'm more mature. I exercise now. I'm mindful. I stay off caffine and sugar. The anxiety medication I was on when I was admitted wasn't helping anything because I had hypertension which wasn't treated properly.  Within two weeks I was off Klonopin.  Within two months I was off prozac. I didn't think I'd ever be off meds. But the dream came true at 33. Hard won fight but I thought it was worth sharing. It's rambles I know.

As an adult, diagnosed with GAD nearly five years ago during a brief stint in rehab, I rejected it. After being through hell as a child, force fed drugs I didn't want and reprimanded by family and doctors for resisting, it was impossible for me to accept. And yet, this morning, after years of day drinking to curb my anxiety and an inability to mainstain a steady job, a seemingly ridiculous fear of everything and an active resistance to discussing my anxiety with anyone, I looked it up. I looked it up because one of the most healthy relationships I have ever been in has found me miserable and terrified all the time. And I burst into tears realizing how incredibly calming it is to know that I am not alone. Now I have to brace myself for reaching out to my doctor.

499,[Help] Is this derealization?,"Ever since my depression and Anxiety started up, I've felt particularly distant from my girlfriend. All of my good memories with her seem tainted now, as if they weren't really as good as I remember them being. I can see little flaws I never cared about before. Its like someone went through all my memories and circled every little thing that I didn't bother noticing, then wrote notes about why it bothers me. And why, based on that, I *obviously* don't love my girlfriend anymore. (FYI, I have a deep fear of leaving my girlfriend, so most of my anxiety is based around me leaving her and not caring, being heartless, etc, even though I *do* love her. It's annoying, stupid, and complicated.)

My girlfriend seems like a stranger. I know her, and I register that what I feel for her isn't platonic, it goes above and beyond that. I can't really register love right now...affection, yes, love? I don't know why but I can't feel it anymore. I know she isn't just a friend. In my head, She's where love should be on the scale, but its like that part of the scale is just...missing. I feel incredibly distant from her, and I don't know how to make that connection, especially when I look at her and she seems like a stranger to me. 

Its rare, but occasionally other people seem like strangers, too. I can't make emotional connections with people anymore, with the exception of a very select few. Sometimes I still feel things, but very vaguely and distantly. Oddly enough, I can still laugh and feel kind of happy. Occasionally, I'll get very dizzy and things seem almost dreamlike.

Is this derealization? If not...is any of this normal for anxiety? If anyone needs better explanations just ask, I'm very tired and a little loopy right now. Thank you!",9,2014-05-15 12:45:28 EDT-0400

503,Its over.,"Today is the end. its the end of all the toxicity i have in my life. 
Its the end of the year, and even though i have progressed (alot) i know i can progress more into 2015. 

 Since i moved to asia, its been in the back of my mind. no more social media. instagram? deleted. tumblr? deleted. facebook? almost 100 people deleted sofar. (i would delete mine if i wasnt studying abroad and far away from my family.they want to see my adventures and i want to build a better relationship with them as well. deleting facebook right now isnt much of an option at the moment.)

deleting instagram took a weight off my shoulders. i cant describe the amount of anxiety i used to have  years ago seeing what pictures my ex boyfriends would like of slutty girls, or who lied to me about what with what theyre doing, or if the guy im seeing is liking instagram pictures instead of texting me back. I had my instagram to prove myself i am worth of something, and living a great life now. FUCK that. nobody needs to know what im doing. this is my life, not theirs.
Deleting facebook friends was even more breathtaking. ive made at least 200 friends from being in this school the past few months, and alot of them quite honestly i dont like. they either simply rub me the wrong way or, its obvious that they either see me as a threat or think im a bitch. lalala bye!!!! deleting all the exboyfriends friends, friends i removed myself from over the year was just so breathtaking.

I cant do this to myself anymore. It wasnt healthy what i was feeling over social networks. im 24 years old and ive had fairly shitty things happen to me - but that doesnt mean i need to treat myself like shit. Panic attacks are the worst feeling ever and for the past 5 years i have suffered way too much from them. I know my triggers, and i know what i need to do to better myself. 

Theres so much more to life, and i hope whomever is reading this will understand that one day, too. :)

But I can't do that, because I can't concentrate properly because of my anxiety - as a result, I just spend most of my free time doing unproductive things on the Internet. Does anyone else feel this way? How do I get out of this vicious cycle? I've tried Celexa, which stopped working after a year, Prozac, which didn't work at all, and Abilify, which made things worse in addition to making me feel sick. I've also tried counseling several times (with two different counselors) and was bitterly disappointed (they didn't seem to know what they were doing). So now I also don't trust counselors.

I'm also a senior in high school, and schoolwork makes my anxiety a whole lot worse.

Do you guys have any advice?

513,You are NOT anxiety - Practice dissociating yourself from anxiety (A bit of a read),"I've recently gotten into meditation and it's opened my eyes up a little, in terms of emotions, specifically anxiety, and I thought I'd share some thoughts and tips. I can say my anxiety, these days is at a low point, and I plan on keeping it there.

Anxiety is a feeling, it is not a personality trait. Unfortunately, some people get anxious more often than others, but that doesn't make those people ""Anxious People"". It might slip our minds sometimes, but anxiety is not who we are. 

I like to personify anxiety. I am simply a person, who tends to get a surprise visit from anxiety, quite often. But, that's all it is. I find creating that dissociation between YOU and anxiety is very important. The fact that you know you are suffering from anxiety, means that you know, that there are two separate entities here ""You"" and ""anxiety"". That's a fantastic start! Good job. 

What happens when anxiety decides to come say hi? Well, your mind reacts, and your thoughts start going all over the place, your body starts to react to it, and then all these lead to YOU feeling the full effects of anxiety. Now if you think about it, these thoughts, and these physiological effects, lead to your mind feeling the effects of anxiety, you are reacting to what is happening in your head and body.

One great exercise, I find, is the next time, you feel anxious, or on the brink of feeling anxious, I want you to scan your body, without judgment. Just observe. Try to paint a mental picture of your body, as it is in that moment, preferably with your eyes closed. 
Start from the top of your head, and work down to your toes. For example my thought process, during these scan are usually ""Hmm, eye brows are a little furrowed, eyes seem like they are concerned, or confused, Jaw is a little tense, my neck isn't stiff, my shoulders are a little stiff, but a tad relaxed, my arms and hands are relaxed, my chest is expanding with my breaths, and air is going in that direction, my stomach is fine, my legs are a little tense, but my feet are relaxed."" You should get the picture by now. What I am doing there is simply seeing how my body is feeling. I am creating a physiological dissociation.

Now that you've analyzed your body, and have a picture painted of how the body feels. Now, it's time to take a look at your thoughts. You are not your thoughts. You react to them, which creates a terrible loop! This concept is a tad confusing, but your thoughts aren't creating by you. They are created by your subconscious, your ego. The fact that when you think of something, and you know that thought is stupid and illogical, must mean that it isn't really ""you"" thinking that thought. If it was, then that thought would be dismissed instantly, as you know it is stupid and illogical. Just like thinking ""The sky is green"". Does that make sense? 

Now, a good exercise for dissociating yourself from your thoughts, is to label them. Nothing complicated. Simply, what is occupying your mind. Is it a thought, or a feeling. That's it. If you have a worry about something you are feeling, such as a feeling that your chest is getting tight. You label that a feeling. Don't dwell on it, don't over-analyze it. Don't attack it. Simply picture yourself putting a little sticker on it, that says feeling (of course, this is so much easier said than done, and gets way easier with practice). While, if you have a worry about a ""what if"" situation, then you label that as a thought. 

Again, these exercises, take practice. Like anything, you will probably not be all that great at first, kudos if you are. The point is that you are trying, and I am proud of you. The better you get at these exercises, the more you are able to dissociate yourself from anxiety, and the more you realize that anxiety is a feeling, which comes and goes.

A few other tips :
- Try to notice when anxiety is there. Try to take into consideration that anxiety comes and goes, but we tend to notice only emotions/feelings when they are present and not, when they are not present.

- When you are feeling anxious, and you are walking, focus on how the soles of your feet feel, with each step. Try to notice how the weight is shipping from the back to the front. 

- If you are sitting, put some of your attention, to the points of contact between your body, and the chair. Notice how your back is against the chair, how your waist and legs are feeling heavy onto the seat of the chair, and how your feet feel against the floor

Hope you are having/have a great day! You deserve to be happy, and anxiety free.

516,The absolute strangeness of living with an anxiety disorder. Do you feel this way too?,"Hey everyone. I have generalized anxiety disorder and social anxiety disorder. 

Can we talk about the absolute strangeness and demented/ distorted feeling you get when living with an anxiety disorder. What I mean is... That feeling that things are not quite right all the time. Not quite the same as depersonalization episodes. Just always having to question your mind and how stable your thoughts are. Or if they make sense? I always feel like my thoughts are broken and scattered or... Confused. And those sudden moments where things around you feel warped and almost too real. A bit circus like. Like just overwhelming, strange, dream like and demented. It can be so sudden, where I feel like the world is huge around me and way too real and it always triggers an anxiety attack. It's exhausting!!! 

It's very hard to describe... But I am hoping I am not alone in this and we can start a conversation that might help me and maybe others understand and lessen the fear of these odd experiences.

518,"""You look like you use reddit.""","I went to my favorite local bar last night to warm up after a Christmas parade. The stop was completely unplanned, and I had no one with me. I was completely engulfed in my phone for a decent amount of time. I enjoy my own company especially at this bar. I also love my phone and the shit I do on it. The guy next to me finally spoke. Mind you, I'm incredibly shy and don't put myself ""out there"" often. For some crazy reason the first words out of his mouth were ""What could you possibly be doing on your phone for that long? The battery has to be dead by now."" I felt a bit put down by this, but showed him how well my battery was doing and said I was talking to my SO and dicking around on Facebook. He replied with ""You look like you use reddit."" Again, thrown off and not feeling this guy at all since the first words out of his mouth weren't nice, I decided to shift things. I told him I loved reddit and lately I've been on it a lot. I'm actually amazed and incredibly confused by that statement. What about me says ""I use reddit?"" Does my appearance somehow convey sites I use? I'm SO confused by this. I don't understand how he'd know I do..

I am shy. I have anxiety. I struggle to talk to people I don't know. And I really don't know how reddit got brought up. 

I honestly feel put down a lot because I don't ""please"" other peoples expectations of how to behave in public. I shouldn't have to perform just because so and so thinks it's the way things should be done. But honestly, it wasn't the only point in the night I felt low about being reserved. 

If I stay home all the time, especially when events are happening, I feel even worse. I don't know what to do anymore. I'm tired of getting crap for being different. I feel stuck and super low.

521,I can't make eye contact and process what the person is saying in a meaningful way,"   So, while I listen, I process what is being said to me by imagining it in my head. When I reply, I have some kind of image or reference in my head as well. However, when I make eye contact, or look at someone's face...I suddenly begin to lose that ability to comprehend what is being said in images. This causes me to derail my train of thought for my reply...and leads me to almost panic.  So if someone says to me ""My dog is furry, white, and is medium sized"", I would suddenly just NOT be able to process what is being said when I look at someone's face. It's almost as if my mind blanks out....and all the words that is being said loses its substance. Almost like the soul and meaning is being absorbed from the words. My mind is literally EMPTY, and my working memory has NOTHING to work with to reply. I do not understand what is said.
     I just don't understand. I understand the importance of eye contact in developing a connection, but how do others do it? Do they make eye contact and simultaneously process what is being said in images? It does NOT make sense to me! When I'm riding with my friend in the car side by side where minimal eye contact or face gazing is required, I have the BEST conversations of my life and develop a connection. It's almost as if my mind associates more freely. On the flip side, if I'm sitting across someone from a table and am almost ""forced' to look at their face....my mind blanks out...I literally can't think, my thoughts get blocked...and I feel like I even disassociate a little bit. The conversation loses it's flow and I am left pissed off and confused about myself. There's a HUGE, HUGE disparity between my interactions with little face to face and ones with a lot. I feel like my brain wrinkles, and twists and turns...and my awareness plummets when I have to look at someones face. 
   I really need help...I really want to be able to connect with people, but it feels like I have to give something up; either giving up the importance of eye contact....or giving up the ability to express myself with my voice and mind. Has anyone gone through the same thing as I have? How have you delt with it? Also is there any tangible condition that goes along with this?My guess is that I am protecting myself due to my hyper-awareness. (I have recently gotten over my disassociative symptoms) Thanks! I really had to get this out.

522,I need advice. Or drugs. Or something. I'm sick of this. I'm so sick of this.,"1mg of Klonopin. 500mg Phenibut. 5mg melatonin. 750mg l-theanine. And I'm still feeling crushed with anxiety right now. Diagnosed with GAD, SAD, Panic Disorder, Agoraphobia. I just don't know what to do any more. I've been looking everywhere and I haven't been able to lower my anxiety in the slightest for months. It's the worst it's ever been. Aside from going to work (I work in construction, the end stages where you don't do much more than touch up the messes painters and the like leave behind. I spend about 90% of my time in an empty house), I spend all day, every day at home. I cut contact with my only friend about four years ago. I'm 22 and I still live with my parents and I can't even fucking drive. My biggest accomplishment within the past three months was ordering a pizza. *Online*. My stepdad drives me to work (he's the assistant supervisor at the same jobsite, and the only reason I have a job).

Xanax, Zoloft, Propranolol, Phenibut. None of those have had any effect except for those first few times I took the phenibut. These days it lowers my inhibitions a bit, but does nothing for anxiety any more, let alone my severe avoidance of, well, everything. The Klonopin does nothing more than give me that 'rubber body' thing. The Propranolol did nothing up to 30mg. At 40mg my heart rate wouldn't go past 60 (which would be fine if I wasn't at work, walking up and down ladders and stairs, hailing 70lb buckets of junk out of homes). Still felt anxious as all hell.

I tried therapy. In highschool. I don't know if it helped. Lasted for a few months, I think. Don't remember her name. I don't believe therapy will help now. The CBT bullshit. I can't imagine a therapist saying something to me I haven't heard a hundred times before. ""People are more focused on themselves than they are on you."" ""Your mistakes are much worse in your mind than they appear to other people."" That doesn't help. God dammit, I just want some freaking relief. Give me five fucking minutes of calm, *please*. I need some god damned help. 

I don't know why I'm writing this post. I don't want sympathy from internet strangers. You know how people with anxiety are. Our self-esteem is so low that if we perceive the slightest sign of an attempt at comfort or sympathy our bullshit detectors go through the roof and we don't believe a single word of it. More than that, we trust the person saying it even less. I don't want commiseration. I want a solution. I want to know what I should try next. Medications. I'm desperate, but I'm not hopeless. I'm just very close to it.

My next suggestion to my doctor is to put me on a higher dose of effexor (on 75mg right now. Minor, minor mood boost but no effect on my anxiety) and put me on BusPar and Vallium (for emergencies). I have a feeling the effexor increase won't help in the sligtest, the BusPar seems to have more anecdotal evidence as being more of a sugar pill than a sedative, and the Vallium will just have the same effect as the other benzos. But I don't know what else to do. If this fails... I'm thinking of trying to talk my doctor into giving me an MAO-I as a last resort. I hope someone else has a better idea. Because aside from these, I'm out of them.",22,2014-12-01 07:07:17 EST-0500

I have no interest in food whatsoever, yet I have to memorise 20 different bread and pastry products (that all look so similar to me). I'm terrible at money maths yet I have to solve sums in a rapid fashion. I'm quiet, reserved and generally the 'slow and steady wins the race' kind of person, yet I work under rapid, rushes and chaotic conditions. I have to annoy the adults every time I need to clarify what's what, or whether I've made this sandwich right, or what to do next. 

I've been given my next shift tomorrow. I don't believe the staff think I'm doing ok; I think they *hope* I'll do ok. Both the customers and the staff must get impatient. I really don't want to go back tomorrow because it's just such a stressful environment and I'm constantly doubting everything I do, because if I don't, I'll make stupid mistakes and be looked down on. I need this job as no other place in my town has gotten back to me, and I need the money for university next year. So I'm stuck with it. I worry from the 5am start of my day to the 10pm end of it.

I tell myself that I'll fuck up in a new workplace, that I won't do good, that people will laugh at me for being nervous, that I'll have a huge panic attack and everyone will think I'm a psycho, etc. I already have it in my head that I will fail.

I have an opportunity for a full time job. I've never had a full time job but I have worked 30-40 hours a week before. This is a pretty easy job but I'm frightened of failure. I also lack support from my family. They have no idea how to support anyone with a problem, and I don't have many friends either. So how can I better deal with my anxiety about working?

536,Tips for sleeping,"Tips & Tricks for Sleeping

These are some suggestions from members and other people with anxiety about overcoming difficulties sleeping. 

• Turn the clock so you cannot see the time when you are lying in bed. It can make you more anxious to keep checking what time it is to wake up in the night and know the hour.

• Use a relaxation technique. I use the one where you start at the toes and progressively relax each muscle. Don’t forget the face muscles.

• Have a warm drink. Chamomile tea is a good relaxant. Or have a warm bath.

• Avoid taking naps during the day because it can make it harder to go to sleep at night. I try to go for a 20-30 minute walk during the day.

• Read in bed for a little while, it helps to turn off the mind-chatter. Some say that bed should only be associated with sleeping, and that reading or watching TV can over stimulate making sleep difficult.

• I used to go to bed and endlessly churn things over in my head, tossing and turning. I then developed a routine that has become automatic now and I rarely have trouble sleeping. I go to bed and lie on one side – my ‘’thinking side’’. I process my day, running through what I have done etc and I am not allowed to beat myself up about anything. I can resolve to do something better but that is all. I then briefly run through what I am doing the next day. When I have done that I roll over to my ‘’sleeping side’’ and I am asleep in minutes. If I can’t resolve something I get up and write it down.

• I always keep pen and paper beside the bed so I can write down thoughts or worries, and then if I think them again I tell myself that I have written them down and will deal with them in the morning. It is also good for recording dreams.

• I deal with my thinking about an hour before bed, and then I decide that I will sleep because the thoughts are taken care of.",27,2014-02-04 06:02:20 EST-0500

I know things have been hard since I moved away and I would give anything to fly back home and help you through everything you're going through. It breaks my heart to know you feel alone and I want you to know that though I may not be there in person, I will always be there. Period. You mean more to me than you'll ever know and having you as a sister and a best friend is truly a bigger blessing than I could ever ask for. We grew up together side by side and the best moments of laughter I have ever shared was with you. I could never truly articulate how thankful I am to have you around through good times and bad times.    

Secondly, You need to know that you are beautiful inside and out. You're caring and kind. You may not see it but you bring so much joy to those around you. Your beautiful smile would brighten anyone's day. All I can ask is that through these times, please don't stop smiling. Keep your head up and your thoughts positive please. There is always and end to troublesome times when you stay positive. Don't be too proud to talk to someone when you need to, because that will help more than you could ever imagine. Whatever the future holds, I know that we'll be in it together. Forever and always.

548,[Rant] I had a huge panic attack during class.,"This is more of a rant than anything, but I would like some feedback on how others handle panic attacks either in places like class or in public in general.

I've had small panic attacks in public before, but I feel lucky to not have a huge one like this until now. I'm a 17 year old female, turning 18 in August, who has had a history of mild anxiety throughout my life. It's gotten considerably worse within the last year, and this was the final straw for me.

We have 7 periods in a full class day, and I was near the end of my 6th period. Everything suddenly started to get really, really bright. After that, I started to feel increasingly more warm. Eventually, I was sweating a little bit. Considering the air conditioning was on and my jacket was off, this was really weird.

When the bell rang, one of my friends noticed I didn't feel good and felt my head. She said I felt really, really warm and walked down to the nurse's office with me to get my temperature taken. I did take my temperature, but it was normal (98F, I believe that's 36C) so I went to my next period.

On the way to my next period I started to get noticeably dizzy. The hallway seemed to be spinning. I had great difficulty walking up the stairs because my legs seemed to be feeling heavier and heavier with each step.

I didn't think it could get any brighter in my next period... boy, was I wrong. It hurt to look in one place for more than a few seconds. My head was spinning (as was the room, slightly) and I felt my legs become more numb.

I noticed a guy in one of the other rows looking straight at me. He mouthed, ""You look sick."" I mouthed back, ""I FEEL sick.""

(At this point, my memory is hazy, so I apologize if I'm not terribly detailed on this.)

Suddenly, a huge pain jolted in my head. I slumped over in the chair. The boy that said I looked sick yelled to the teacher as soon as I did that. My vision was blurry, and I had sort of a black frame around the edges of my vision. From what I remember, the teacher looked horrified. (I later discovered it was the first time she had this happen, and she was actually horrified.) The only thing she asked was that if I could make it to the office by myself. At this point I couldn't feel my legs, so I mouthed (I couldn't find my words for some reason) ""Probably not.""

She got another girl a row behind the boy to take me out into the hall. My teacher got another teacher who didn't have a class to walk me to the nurse's office. It was hard to walk, my legs felt like lead whenever I moved them. It didn't help that I felt like I was overheating, either, even though I knew I wasn't.

I sat on the couch in the nurse's office taking deep breaths and dabbing a wet paper towel on my face. Eventually, I started to feel calmer and was able to go about my business again.

The weirdest part about this whole experience was that there wasn't any trigger. I had no reason to be nervous. It just happened, no warning, nothing. I also feel lucky to have had supportive friends during that, as some came down after school had ended to see how I was doing. It was humiliating, because a good amount of my classmates saw me at a weaker point, despite me being known for being positive even in negative situations. I was worried some people would think I was just being a drama queen, because I know with people my age that if you do not have problems with anxiety then you probably will not understand it when it happens to others and just read it off as being dramatic.

I'd like to hear some experiences you guys have had with panic attacks in public. Have you guys ever had a rather big one like mine? What did you do? I want to prevent a future one in any way I can, so any advice on helping that would also be a huge plus.

Either way, thank you for reading my rant. I feel so much better getting this out.",5,2014-02-01 17:38:59 EST-0500

553,A message to this forum from someone who beat anxiety permanently: you're much more normal than you realize.,"The one thing I see in this forum over and over again is people blaming their personality. They believe that they are inherently weak and in general abnormal because of feelings of intense anxiety.

**The problem was never the simple fact that you feel anxious or even afraid. Nor was the problem the way that you express yourself when you feel anxious or stressed.** Anyone can experience anxiety and there are lots of ways to express that sense of worry. What sets apart the people here from others who aren't battling anxious disorders is the *intensity* of the anxiety that you feel. This is a very important key in your recovery and management. 

Believe it or not, most of the things that you do *are normal.* Stress habits, worries, even the fear of success are all things that anyone can experience because it is a basic feature of the human brain to weigh risks and adopt ways to cope, even if those methods used to cope aren't logical (good luck charms, horoscopes, etc).

You have to give yourself the credit you deserve. Blaming your entire personality will only add to the stress that will eventually add up to feelings if intense anxiety. That's no good. **Your personality is not the problem.**

The different anxious disorders have lots of things in common: indecisiveness, self consciousness, fear of failure, inadequacy, disappointing others, rejection, being exposed in your social environment, being exploited, being overwhelmed from thinking ahead, developing stress habits, urges to alienate others, even urges to lean on others for support. All of which can be chronically distressing and even disheartening to the person who feels compelled to do these things.

All of those things are related. **All of these things are normal human things.** We're social animals. We're supposed to lean on each other when we need them. No one can do everything alone. We listen to what others think about us so that we can learn if we are valuable to those people, and to help us learn about ourselves. We all have to take big risks in life and we all have to be prepared for the worst things, even when we feel like we've done everything right - that's just being realistic. Most importantly, we all have a breaking point and we will all hit that breaking point sooner or later. 

None of those things were ever the problem. Just because you experience these things, that does not make you weak or defective in any way. These are all normal things that anyone can experience given the right circumstances. **There's no reason to feel ashamed or embarrassed because you are experiencing things that any person would experience. You do not have to hold these things against yourself.**

The only real problem is the intensity of the anxiety that you feel. This may make you hit your breaking point sooner or keep you up a little longer at night but that's really it. That's the difference between a generally anxious person and someone who isn't. **It's not what you do, but why you do it.**

Realizing that the difference between you and the rest is such a small difference will allow you to see yourself through much better scope. One that allows you to see that true extent of your problems is much smaller than you currently realize.

When I struggled with anxiety, once I realized how much I had in common with the average person, I realized that my attention was in the wrong places and it was making me worse. I was carrying around the unhelpful notion that I was meant to suffer because I was the entire problem. It was when I realized that I had misjudged myself as inferior for no real reason that I really started to make improvements. When the burden if believing that I was a person of weak character was lifted, I started to see myself as a person of merit. That's what made my recovery possible and permanent.

To anyone reading this who is looking for a way out of an intense pattern of anxiety, the best advice I can give you as someone who once had to live with that curse... Please humanize yourself and give yourself the credit that you need to make the changes that you want. You are much more normal than you realize and it's safe to accept it.

554,[Rant] Pharmacist adds his opinion when picking-up meds,"So I've suffered from anxiety and depression since middle school.  When I was younger it was easier to moderate with therapy and occasional exercising/diet change. Unfortunately I find myself in my late 20s and things have gotten out of control (at least a full panic attack per week, anxious non-stop) so my therapist suggested talking to a psychiatrist and perhaps taking some meds.  

Now I was a psych major in college and have a *basic* understanding of how different meds work and the side effects, etc. so I'm also aware of the benefits of a combo of therapy and medication.  I was prescribed Lexapro by the psychiatrist and since this was my first time filling the prescription, I had to have a consult with the pharmacist.

The pharmacist immediately looks at the medicine and asks, ""what's wrong with you?"".  Slightly taken aback, I tell him it's for anxiety and depression.  He then starts lecturing me on mental illness and  declares that I don't need the meds because what's wrong with me is all in my head and I can ""get over it"" if I really want to.

**I WANTED TO SCREAM**.  Bitch, are you my psychiatrist?!?  Or a psychiatrist in general?  Then just stick to your job, tell me about the meds, and keep your opinions to yourself.

But of course I didn't say anything like that cause the last thing I needed was to draw tons of attention.  Just told him that my Dr prescribed it so I guess they thought I needed and let him lecture me on alcohol use.

560,"Last week , I went through my ""worst fear""","Past:

When I was 17, I developed some serious social anxiety problems. I also became extremely agoraphobic. I stressed and panicked every time I had to take the subway to get to college every morning. Sometimes I had to get off and throw up because I always felt sick to my stomach. I felt trapped when the train doors closed shut since I felt like I was stuck in the train until we reached the next station. If the doors closed and the train didn’t move for half a minute, I’d start getting panic attacks and only when the train started moving again would I feel relieved.

At college, it wasn’t any better. I was insanely uncomfortable in classrooms since I wasn’t used to large class sizes. I had to skip a lot of classes. I was never hungry, and I probably lost about 25 pounds in 3 months (6’1 165 ->140). I also lost many of my friends because I couldn’t explain to them what was going on. In short, my life sucked hard during that time.

But here’s why I’m writing this. As much as my life sucked, I didn’t give up. I grinded though each day even though I knew it would be painful sometimes. Eventually my anxiety seemed to relax a little bit, not because I made rational sense of my fears but because I got tired of going through this stuff every damn day. I just brute forced my way out of my anxiety. Every time I’d put myself in a situation which gave me anxiety, I’d kill a little part of that anxiety hovering over me. It’s difficult to put yourself in a situation you think you can’t handle, but it worked and eventually, fewer things scared me.

Present:

Now I am 22. Sometimes I am still anxious but I’d say I can handle anxiety very well to the point where I feel relatively “normal”. I think getting passed this part of my life is by far my best achievement in life.

Last week, I got stuck in the subway in the middle of the tunnel. This was my ultimate fear back then. I was literally trapped in a locked crowded space and I couldn’t get out. No electricity to the train, no ventilation, only a few lights lit. Needless to say, my heart rate rose sharply at first, but that was it! I was stuck in there for a good 45 minutes and I handled it like it was nothing. I couldn’t believe it! I was probably the only person in there who was actually happy because I proved that I had changed a lot since my problems started. We had to climb out of the train and walk to the next station and that was that.  

So there you go. You may think that your problems never go away but if you work at it and put some effort to get better, you’ll get out of it. Hope this helps someone.

561,"Prozac has helped my anxiety, but absolutely killed my sex drive.","I'm a woman and was prescribed 10mg of Prozac two months ago when I first came to my doctor about anxiety. She said that my symptoms sound more like depression but there's also some strong anxiety symptoms, so she put me on Prozac. 

One of my symptoms before I even got on prozac was that my anxiety was already crushing my libido as it was.

A month later, I told her that some of my anxiety had faded, others persisted, and that my libido was going downhill even further. She increased my dosage to 20mg.

Since then, I can't masturbate, I can't get aroused, and when I even try, I can't orgasm. Trying to orgasm gives me an anxiety attack because it's never been that big of an issue.

My husband understands and has been incredibly supportive. He isn't pestering me about the lack of sex at all besides a very calm question of ""How's your libido been lately?"" We've tried having sex just for him, but he can't enjoy sex unless I'm enjoying it.

564,Anxious about developing schizophrenia. Please help.,"It all started 2 months ago. I had a terrifying and intense panic attack that lasted several hours after smoking marijuana. It was so severe that I began to chug Gin in order to black myself out, so I could end the panic attack/go to bed. That plan backfired, and I ended up pacing outside, extremely paranoid, on the brink of calling 911. Somehow, through it all, I was able to tell myself that I was having an adverse reaction from the weed, and that the feeling would go away come morning. I couldn't have been more wrong.

I woke up the next morning in a funk, and extremely anxious. I even left work early that day because the anxiety was so intense. I quickly made an appointment with a psychiatrist and counselor, and was put on a low dose of meds. After a couple of weeks, I started feeling even more anxious, so I decided to stop taking them (I've always been skeptical of medication, so that didn't help).

Fast forward to today, and I'm still pretty shook up (although not as bad as I was at first). My biggest fear is that I'm slowly losing my mind/developing a mental illness (specifically Schizophrenia), and that fear is absolutely consuming me. I quickly learned that I shouldn't google symptoms of the illness (or anything in that realm) but the damage has been done, and now I can't stop thinking about them. I'm especially freaked out right now because I thought I heard someone call my name at the grocery store, but I couldn't confirm if it was just a voice in my head, or if I was mishearing something someone was saying. I read a personal account of someone with schizophrenia, and he/she said that his/her first symptoms were thinking that someone was calling his/her name from another room.
The only thing that gives me hope is that I have 0 family history of schizophrenia, but anxiety runs down the family line in every generation.

So, are my worries coming true? Does does there seem to be a serious mental illness developing? I would appreciate any advice/thoughts/etc. Thank you for your help, and thank you for listening.",14,2014-08-23 19:21:45 EDT-0400
565,Just got home from the dentist and it was a nightmare,"I'm shaking and crying still. This is ridiculous.

I'm terrified of needles and have some pretty back anxiety. Before I even went in, I told them that I have a very bad fear and need to be numbed or knocked out or SOMETHING before I can get a cleaning done. They said it's not a big deal and so i have my appointment. 

Well I first get there and find out I have the wrong insurance. So I'm looking like an idiot asking what's the difference between dental and medical insurance and why dental isn't part of medical since dental is a part of medicine. I honestly didn't know they were two separate things. The nurse starts trying not to laugh at me, which makes me feel even worse, so then I'm fumbling around my phone trying to find the info and i finally find it. 

I go back and just remind them that I would like to at least be numbed for the cleaning and she said that was fine. They go and take pictures and i find out that my gums are receding in the front of my teeth and that I need to have some procedure done or I'll lose them. They hand me a bill before we start for $600. I literally have less than $100 in my bank account.

So  I naturally start crying and freaking out. I say I thought it was just $40 today (for xrays and a cleaning) and that I don't even have half this and he said it was ok, they would just do the regular cleaning and I could schedule another appt when I had the money. So they start the cleaning and I ask if I was going to get numbing cream or something and they said they didn't have time because they were running behind on their next appt (since it took me 30 minutes to find my dental info). Which makes ME feel like a dumbshit. So now I'm freaking out that 1. My teeth are falling out 2. I have all these needles in my mouth 3. These people know I'm dirt poor and 4. I'm causing people to run behind schedule. 

I can feel myself starting to have an anxiety attach and try to tell them I need a break. They say something like ""we just started, just wait a few minutes and it will pass"" and so I wait. It gets worse. and worse. and worse.

I'm straight up sobbing at this point and just sit up with all their shit still in my mouth and just say I can't do this and I'll pay for the cleaning anway. They got about halfway through, so I just give them my card and leave. 

I took some of my klonopin, but I just want to crawl into bed and die. I was supposed to do laundry and go run errands I just mentally can't do anything right now. I hate this feeling. ",9,2014-08-25 23:06:18 EDT-0400

591,Anxiety and IBS,"So, here is the background story. At the end of my 2013 Spring semester of college, the 3rd to last day before the semester ended, I was driving to school and I had to go to the bathroom. I had to go REALLY bad, so I drove into the school's library parking lot, parked as fast as I could, then walked as fast as I could to the library bathroom. Feeling like I was going to crap my pants, I walked towards the men's bathroom towards the back of the library. I walked in to find the only 2 stalls were currently occupied. Starting to panic even more, I quickly jogged upstairs where I knew another bathroom was located. I walk up to the door to be presented with a locked door and a sign that said ""bathroom closed for maintenance."" Panicking, trying as hard as I could to not have an ""accident"" I made an executive decision and just ran into the girls bathroom into a stall, (luckily no one was in there). After relieving my bowels I thought ""okay, that was a close one,"" and then I figured I would be okay.

This is where the issue originated. From then on out, I seemed to have a huge problem with being able to control my bowels. I figured it must be anxiety related because it is entirely in my head. Every single time I get in my truck, or even walk to my truck, I instantly feel the urge to go to the bathroom. Obviously this is an issue since I have to commute to school, with no where to stop on the way because my classes start so early in the morning, sometimes I just have to turn around and something I don't even make it to school. Also, when I want to go back to my hometown, which is roughly 3 hours away, it's just as bad. One time while driving back to school from home, I had to stop 9 different times to use gas station bathrooms.

Every time I go somewhere now I have to wonder how far it is and plan where I could possibly stop to use the restroom on the way. Note, this problem is severe; I have to go to the bathroom RIGHT when I feel the urge coming on. I have tried multiple things to help, including probiotics, talking to psychologists to help change my mindset, etc. but nothing has worked.

I was wondering if anyone else on this subreddit possibly experiences the same issues and what has worked for you. I've visited multiple GI doctors and none of them have said I have colon/stomach related issues, they just say it's IBS (irritable bowel syndrome) and give me anti-diarrhea pills (which do not work).

TL;DR: I think I have possibly more than IBS and need help, all resulting from potential anxiety. ",17,2014-04-03 04:30:36 EDT-0400

595,Work with me on a 2 week drill to reduce anxiety using an app I made,"Let's work together to actually seem some results. I made an app recently for the sake of improving mental health. It reminds you with vibrate+sound notifications to both meditate and exercise if you haven't already. You have to fulfill the daily requirements by using the timer built in or else it'll keep reminding you.

[Screenshots of the app so you get an idea](http://imgur.com/a/Sqhoq) 

[App in playstore](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=azureloop.azurebreath) 

We'll use the default time (20 minutes meditation, 20 minutes exercise). But let's change it from the default single reminder to 4 daily reminders. The time of the reminders don't matter particularly, just set it to whatever is convenient for you. 

For those who don't know about meditation, it's basically a sitting exercise where you try to clear your mind through various methods. Normally it's very hard for us to sit in one place and do nothing so you'll meet a lot of mental resistance. But it improves after time and you'll finally realize that it is possible to sit there doing nothing. The most common and easy meditation is concentrating on your breath. When you lose concentration (will happen) you simply and calmly return to your breath. Doesn't matter how long you lost concentration, the important thing is that you returned to it. Deep breaths are key.

There are multiple types you there. [Here are a list of them](http://www.fitsugar.com/5-Types-Meditation-18949375). 

The other popular type is known as ""mindfulness"" meditation. Where simply think about what you're thinking about. Accept going off tangent simply and keep observing your thoughts. Whatever happens just accept it and continue observing.

Here are some papers on meditation

[Mindfulness-based stress reduction for older adults with worry symptoms and co-occurring cognitive dysfunction](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24677282)

[Meditation Programs for Psychological Stress and Well-Being](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmedhealth/PMH0063263/)

Any many more exist. I assume I won't have to link the advantages of exercise... But what I do use for exercise is this: http://www.fitocracy.com/knowledge/dr-layne-nortons-best-damn-cardio-humanly-possible-in-15-minutes/

“is more effective for fat burning than walking on an incline treadmill for over an hour.” In fifteen minutes. It doesn't feel like walking up for an hour but it does guarantee that I start sweating even in this winter.

By the end of the two week drill we will share our progress reports (graphs, built in) to  all on this subreddit and comment on how much we improved. If all goes well, we can increment our time to 30 minutes a day and possibly see some decent progress.

596,[Rant]I've just had to most frightening experience of my life.,"**I'm sorry this got so long.**

I don't know what to do now, it's 1AM, I have class in 8 hours, I've already called my girlfriend and she has tried to console me; it didn't make me feel any better but I told her that it did so that she would not have to go to sleep feeling scared or sad for me.  

I have anxiety.  A lot of anxiety.  So much that it ruins days at a rate that is beginning to feel almost total.  I don't know where to start so I'm going to start as far back as my obscurant memory will allow.  Not because I think it is necessary or that anyone will want to hear it, but because I've never spilled everything out at once before and I feel like it might be cathartic.  Cathartic both in that it is an intense spilling of emotion and as in it probably wont actually make me feel any better.  But I guess it isn't like I'll be sleeping soon anyway.

I remember a time when I felt like everything was okay.  I remember being 5 years old playing in the backyard with my brother.  I remember the other kids in kindergarten making fun of me because they thought I had a crush on a girl in class; I remember how moments like that felt bad, embarrassing, sad, but not in any way that is recognizable to me now.  Things felt different then, maybe it was because I had breaks between the anxiety back then, maybe I wasn't anxious at all.  I only have a few of these memories left.

Most of my memories don't exists as snapshots in time or a slideshow of my life, they exist as fact.  What I mean by this is that I know something happened, I can tell you it happened, I may feel like it happened, but I can't really remember it any more than if I had read it in a book.  Most of my memories are like this, cold, cataloged, distant.  I don't know why this is.  This is one of many things I've wanted to ask a doctor for the past few years, but as many of you probably know, it is not easy to ask things when you are sitting in an exam room or shifting uncomfortably on a shrink's couch.

I feel like I was half-raised by shrinks.  From counseling my anxiety after moving from house to house for a few years, to being in high school listening to my parents fight in the basement of our house every night.  It probably wasn't actually every night but it felt like it.  My parents didn't know that I could hear them.  I learned this last year and every time I've seen my mother since she apologizes for it.  That only makes me feel worse.

But my anxiety was always manageable then, it existed almost as pervasively as it does now, but occasionally I could forget about it for a while.  Anyway, I made it out of high school, thanks to some teachers who gave me grades I didn't deserve, and went off to university.  Political Science and Pre-Law it was.  My first year was great; life away from my family was great, after the first 2 months where I didn't know anyone my life really felt like it was good, I felt like I could do what I needed to do to stay out of my parents' house forever.  I've stuck to that but it hasn't been as easy as I dreamt it would be.

As that summer came around I tried desperately for the last few months of school to find any sort of job and was entirely unfruitful.  I had no extra loan or scholarship money that year and my parents didn't have the money to put me up in a place in the city, I didn't have the money to put me up in a place in the city.  That summer I spent on friends' couches and empty spaces, places where no one else was.  It was during this period of half-homelessness that I was robbed the first two times; it was also the time that I learned I can survive a lot of shit.  I was living in a house with no electric, no gas, cold water (thankfully), a roof that leaked, and a pissed off cat that belonged to my roommate.

That summer I lost a lot of weight; I lived off of cheap alcohol and cigarettes, scavenged food and whatever money my parents could send me every month.  I told them I was living on a friend's couch all summer, I never told them that sometimes I had nowhere safe to sleep.

One night I was walking around after having a bit to drink and as I approach a corner three young guys turn and head my direction, I didn't think much of it initially but as we moved closer together I realized what was about to happen.  I figured it was too late to run.  As I walked past the first kid he sucker punched me in the side of the face and I went down hard; once I got my wits about me I realized they were running my pockets and one of them was yelling at me to give them my backpack.

As I became more lucid I realized these kids were probably 16 years old at the most.  It didn't much matter how old they were because I didn't dodge his sucker punch.  The kids didn't look like they were in it for the fun of it, they seemed like they just wanted my wallet.  So they took literally everything I had and started to walk away.  I, dazed, asked for my backpack back because I ""really needed it.""  And, believe it or not, they gave it back.  So they took all my money but I still had my mp3 player and my cigarettes.  Some good citizens saw this happen out of their window and kindly called the cops who harassed me that night and continued to harass me into the near future.

This situation had me well rattled but I was on my feet pretty quickly.  I had a dry place to sleep for the next week or so, I continued looking for steady work and doing whatever manual labor I could find, but I avoided being out after dark.  I still do, usually.

About a week later I began going about my normal business at night, only ever with groups of three or more, but still I wasn't afraid.  I went out once to go from the house I was staying at to a friend's place in a different neighborhood, once to go see a basement show, then once on a walk with friends as an attempt to begin to systematically desensitize myself.

This is when I got robbed the second time, and it was not quite as fun.  At the time I was right queer, beard stubble, painted finger and toe nails, some bright clothing, was really into Judith Butler, et cetera.  I've sort of had that beat out of me I guess.  I still enjoy theorizing on the deconstruction of gender but I wear the uniform of the correct gender.

Anyway, this time me and two friends were walking down a, usually busy, street at night, it was in a family neighborhood with low crime and we were just going for a night time stroll.  As we are walking down this street three cars pull up in front of us a ways, we were all talking so we didn't think anything of it, again until it was too late.  A fairly large number of people jumped out of the cars (including a, likely stolen, car with a charity logo painted on the side) and lined up the sidewalk in front of us.  I began to panic, my friends and I began to shuffle around anxiously, clearly, not that it would have much mattered what we did since there were people all around us.  I walked first in the marching order, fuck if I know why.  Once I got to the end of the row of gentlemen a brawny guy, the biggest of them, grabbed me around the neck from behind and pulled me to the ground.  At this point I went numb and heard myself calmly utter ""Aw fuck.""

I didn't get hit right away, at first there were three guys standing around me, they didn't look like the poor kids who robbed me last week, they were smiling and laughing.  One of them goes through my pockets and grabs all I have left, a zippo lighter and a paint pen and a few cigarettes.  (I had left half a pack at the house I was crashing at because I didn't want to carry all of it on me)

They take the nothing I have on me and start calling me a bitch and one of them slaps me across the face.  This whole time I am sitting still, hoping they will just go away like last week.  One of them started kicking me in the ribs, I got kicked in face, and then I started moving.  I got from the sidewalk almost to the street when one of them kicked me down to the curb, I thought for sure I was about to reenact a scene from American History X.

I got up and got away to the other side of the boulevard.  I turned around and one guy was following me, I got ready to do I don't know what and he got called back by an older guy sitting in a fancy car.  My friends were fine and the rest of the summer was easier.

To this day I am afraid to go out at night.  I am afraid to go out during the day.  I feel a near constant pain in my chest.  I'm trying everything I can and nothing helps for long.  I'm in my last semester.  I have debt, I have no job, I have a fractured spine (doctors are split on if it was caused by being kicked in the spine or by heavy lifting), I planned to take a year off before law school; I'm hoping to find a job in a law office since I can't' do construction any more, I also can't stand or sit for long enough to do almost any other job (combination of mostly pain and some anxiety).  I don't know where I am going to live in two months.  It feels weird paying a phi beta kappa fee to a stuffy guy in a suit while feeling crushing despair that I will have to relive my past because I might not be able to pay rent.  I don't sleep much.  I'm trying medicine and therapy.  I don't know what to do now.

Tonight I had the worst panic attack of my life.  I felt like I was shaking violently back and forth like an overclocked metronome but I could see that I wasn't actually moving.

But no, immediately when the plain takes of I almost poop my pants. Eventually when the plain is flying steady I can come to my senses, however if the plane makes an unexpected movement I will be pooping my pants again, and it takes like half an hour to become a little more relaxed again.

Does anybody know something I can do or say to myself to stop me being afraid of flying?

599,"Always anxious at my job. Absolutely hate it, but can't quit yet because I need money for rent. What should I do?","I am working as a night stocker for a large hardware warehouse type store. We are horribly understaffed and I am the weakest member of the team. Every day I go to work, I am scared that I will not finish, or that I will have to do something I am uncomfortable with.

Everyday is worse than the last, and people are getting hurt around me.

609,Had a relapse today.,"This morning I had a panic attack for the first time in about 3 months. Having felt uneasy while doing my morning routine, I ignored it and went on with my morning. I stopped at a coffee shop for some joe and to get a little work done early. As I sipped my coffee and started to work on some homework I could feel the uneasiness grow. Fearing the worst I went into the restroom and splashed water on my face. I went back out and didn't feel any better, so I popped a Lorazepam. Well I guess the fear needed my emergency pills finally pushed me over the edge and a full on panic attack ensued.


I tired to talk to myself and took deep breathes. Eventually I was able to calm down enough to drive back home. I went straight to bed and watched TV and kept trying to talk myself down. Luckily, I have a weekly meeting with a therapist and it happened to be today in the morning. So I was able to work it out with him. I felt much better.


My last panic attack triggered a week long depression where I was unable to get out of bed. I was very worried this would happen again. Luckily there have been no signs of such a reaction, considering I've gone to work today with no problems. 


I just wanted to share my little victory today in overcoming and controlling my anxiety. Thanks for reading!

613,Does anyone have experience with uncontrollable crying fits?,"Hi everyone, I'm not really sure if this is the right place to ask this, but I could not think of anywhere else. 

Within the last two years I have had several ""crying fits"", and don't really know how to control them in any kind of way. Typically this happens whenever I get yelled at by someone about anything I did/didn't do. It does not matter who it is, or if I actually did something wrong or not. Basically I can feel my heart rate rise, I get an instant headache which is usually followed by difficulty with breathing/talking. Often I feel a weird kind of pressure on my chest as well and by that time I can already feel the tears. Sometimes I make it out of the room without crying, sometimes I don't, which is pretty embarrassing, especially at work.

Has anyone ever dealt with anything like that? Did you learn to control it? I really don't know what to do about this and am very thankful for any advice.   

Thanks for taking the time to read this, and I'm really sorry for spelling/grammar mistakes (english isn't my native language).

615,[Help] Anxiety has kept me unemployed for five long years.,"I used to be severely depressed, and would have anxiety attacks in common crowded places like grocery stores. I've come a long way since then. I finished my degree in information systems, I started taking care of myself (down 65 pounds), started meditating, started NoFap, have a deep and rich circle of friends who are truly supporting... I've learned to love and accept myself.

But here I am. The same wall I've fought, climbed, and ran away from for five years. I don't know why I'm so afraid of getting a job, but it's paralyzing. I had two jobs before this started, no fuss no muss. I reached out for professional help twice... It didn't work out. I've tried sitting down and forcing my way through it over and over again, which usually just ends up leaving me broken and afraid.

It's a known issue to my friends. But I can't expect them to understand. 

Putting my entire self-worth on a single sheet of paper and imagining someone snickering at it, blowing it off, joking about it to their co-worker... It just makes my stomach churn. 

Right now I'm trying to apply to places on a cycle. Two a day, then one a day, then two a day. Today I need to apply to two places. I already feel pretty anxious. 

I feel kind of dumb reaching out like this. I've been reaching out like this for years. But I think that not reaching out, not putting myself out there... Is a step back.

“Close your eyes and take three deep breaths… This is the only moment you need to worry about. No yesterday. No tomorrow. Just right now. You’re not late for anything. You aren’t going to miss anything. You’re exactly where you’re supposed to be and you’re exactly who you’re supposed to be.

I have no idea what they'll say as I stay clear of the internet for self-diagnosis. Basically my issues are anxiety, depression, intrusive thoughts, month long lows followed by week long crazy highs where I go crazy, cause arguments (I'm the most placid person normally, it's quite an upsetting change). During my highs I've gambled away every penny I owned and posted nudes on the internet. Then been absolutely ""WTF BRAIN!?"" mortified When I get my marbles back.

619,[Relaxing] There's no such thing as perfect.,"I was watching the last episode of Courage the Cowardly Dog (Season 4, Episode 13, Part 2) last night. It's about Courage's struggle with being imperfect. His mind creates a perfect teacher to instruct him in being perfect, but he does everything imperfectly. His teacher scolds him and tells him that if he does not become perfect, there will be consequences. He worries about it so much that he has nightmares about how being imperfect will ruin everything he cares about.


But then, at the end, before his ""final exam"" in perfection, a fish tells him in a calm and accepting tone, ""There's no such thing as perfect. You're beautiful as you are, Courage. With all your imperfections, you can do anything.""


This was a really good reminder to me. Many people worry about being imperfect. It's one of my main worries when I interact with others or do things that are new (or in a lot of cases, familiar) to me. It was really reassuring, and I hope others reading this will feel reassured as well. It's okay to be imperfect.",5,2014-02-26 22:21:20 EST-0500

627,No one gets that anxiety makes socialising fundamentally different.,"The other day I posted here seeking help with a really long backstory on my current situation (basically history of anxiety and depression, haven't been able to make friends or socialise at uni), but I ended up deleting it because no one replied.  I came here as I've really got no one to talk to about it - no real friends, don't want to be ~that girlfriend~, and my parents only say things like, ""You'll find your group eventually.""

But given my circumstances, I really don't see how that would happen.  I can physically feel it, the fact that I have little personality among people who have bubbling social lives.  Like my flatmates, for instance.  They're friendly to me, and I engage them in conversations, but I can sense that conversation with me is polite when they walk away to go gossip and relay inside jokes with one another like close friends usually do.  

I feel like my history, on top of depression and anxiety, has fundamentally changed me to the point that I do not comprehend normal socialisation.  And it really feels like people can sense that and that it plays a major part in why I don't make friends like everyone else does.

Like, my parents don't get that it's not a matter of time.  It's a matter of tools, and I've lost mine.

Edit: to say that I realise that I kind of seem to reject peoples' advice but I honestly don't mean to and it doesn't mean I don't greatly appreciate it.",51,2014-10-06 21:31:21 EDT-0400

I have a doctors appointment on tuesday about my anxiety. And I am not really sure what to say with out sounding bat shit crazy. I carry a lot of scares, and they have really wore me down.  I am only 21 but I've already: been in jail, been in behavioral health center, been 7k in debt, faced felony chargesr, been abandoned by all friends, wet the bed til middle school, rejected by everyone and felt alone my whole life.  I am really good at lying though.  I can put up a good mask and ""fit in"" but its all a facade.  My only problem right now is that I cant focus on school work, I have so many other problems that I am fine with but they just seem to make their way back into my head.  I have a girlfriend that is oblivious to this all and thats part of the problem.  I was never shown love as a child, my parents neglected me, and it reflects back on how i treat others.  I am good making people seem like I give a shit, but in realty I don't, well sometimes I do but some days I don't.  Like one day I'll be fine and want to help people and talk to them and then the next day my problems come back and I just cant seem to think of something else and i am unconditionally pissed off at everyone.  I want to tell my doctor all this but I don't know if he'll understand, I have a hard time focusing and my grades are starting to reflect that, I just get caught up on a different tangent and can't stay on one topic, i just go back to hating life. 

EDIT:  I just don't want him to ask me about my old problems, I am over them, but they do come back.  I am afraid that if i start to talk about my past then something bad will happen. I feel fine most of the days, I just rather not be in school because I cant do the work, it's stupid but it drives me crazy.  Calculus is hard and my engineering teacher hates me.

The description: 


The Fear
Duration: 1 hour
First broadcast: Tuesday 30 September 2014


Almost 1 in 5 people feel anxious a lot or all of the time. Anxiety is one of the most prevalent mental health problems in the UK, yet it is still under-reported, under-diagnosed and under-treated.


Jameela Jamil has suffered with anxiety and depression since she was a child. With help from a therapist, she is starting to be able to control her condition and its affect on her life is lessening. In 'The Fear', Jameela investigates the causes and cures, and speaks to others whose lives have been affected.


Jameela has found that having a career in the spotlight has worsened her anxiety. She speaks to X-Factor winner James Arthur and singer Laura Mvula to see how they have juggled their music careers with their own battles with anxiety. She also chats to presenter Anna Williamson, who conquered her fear of swimming pools and went on to appear on ITV's 'Splash'.


Keen to get an expert's view on anxiety and depression, Jameela asks The Radio 1 Surgery's Dr Radha and the charity Mind to find out how young people can access help, and learn what can be done to combat anxiety and depression.


Finally, Jameela speaks to four young people whose battles with anxiety and depression have already had a significant impact on their lives. She finds out what life has been like living with these conditions at such a young age, and discusses how young people can move forward when battling anxiety and depression.",4,2014-09-30 23:19:24 EDT-0400

635,Feeling guilty for no reason.,"I'm not entirely sure if /r/Anxiety is the correct subreddit for this, but I think it qualifies. 

Anyway, I tend to get intense feelings of guilt for no reason. I take perfectly innocent encounters or situations, and mull them over in my head until I convince myself that I must have done something really wrong. When I've finally convinced myself that I have something to feel guilty about I get an awful feeling in the pit of my stomach, I find it hard to concentrate on anything else, I'll feel flush, and sometimes get a little shaky or have a cold sweat. This tends to happen when I'm alone, normally in the evening, when there's nobody around to focus my attention on, and I'm left to my own thoughts.

I'll list some of the many simple/innocent things that I've ended up with really guilty thoughts on. For example, in my first year of university I opted not to retake a test; a very simple thing, nothing awful, but a couple months later I thought back on it and after an hour had convinced myself that I'd ruined my education and would need to repeat a year (something that did not end up happening). Another is my smoking - I know, a bad habit that I am in the process of quitting, but not the end of the world - and I ended up thinking that my parents were going to absolutely hate me if they found out and may even stop me from seeing my boyfriend, which is completely irrelevant to the smoking matter (my partner doesn't even smoke and I can't imagine why my parents would punish me by not allowing me to see him). And there have been instances where I've taken innocent flirtatious encounters, or teenage games of truth or dare/spin the bottle, and have been convinced that girls have felt harassed by me (despite the fact that nobody has ever told me or expressed that I have made them uncomfortable in that way; when someone isn't interested I take a hint and back off). These aren't the only things I've had feelings of unnecessary guilt over, but they are some that come to mind.

I would love some advice on how to deal with this matter. I know this subreddit does encourage counselling/therapy, but I'd like to be able to try relieving myself of this issue on my own before considering taking things further. Some advice on how to stop these guilty thoughts would be great. And if I'm in the process of having one of these anxiety episodes, how can I calm down and remind myself that I have nothing to feel guilty of?

**edit:** I should probably add that I am not a socially anxious person. I am very approachable, and can speak to people I don't know quite easily. In fact, I work in retail, and I'm fine in that environment. It's just when I'm left alone that I begin to suffer these anxiety attacks.",9,2014-10-05 02:26:03 EDT-0400

637,Too affected by other people's moods?,"I've never been diagnosed with anxiety (because I've always been too anxious to get professional help when I thought I needed it, haha) but it seems to be a fluctuating thing in my life, thankfully not seriously debilitating me all the time.

One thing that's pretty consistent is that I'm hyper-sensitive to other people's moods or states of mind... anyone else feel this, or is this just a totally normal thing? A lot of my friends seem to have this ability to cheer someone up or lighten up the room if there's a bad vibe, but I'm unable to do that. Instead, it just affects me a lot and I freeze up. Even coworkers being stressed in the same room just stresses me out a lot - I feel like if I don't take on the same emotions myself, I'll make the situation worse. And if someone else in the room isn't ""respecting"" the bad mood, I get kind of agitated and angry at them for not doing the same. It's a weird reaction and I suspect it has something to do with having a parent who was emotionally manipulative to a pretty thorough extent.

Since I know logically that I don't HAVE to take on the emotional baggage, especially when it's a mundane thing like someone else's workday stress, does anyone have any tips for... not doing so? It's just frustrating how easy it is to go from having a good day to being stressed out and feeling like everything's off not because of someone else's mood, but my own reaction to it.",15,2014-10-04 07:49:43 EDT-0400

639,"Does anyone else hate it when someone says ""but you look like you're doing so well!""?","Or, ""but you look so good!"" or, ""you look like you're doing so much better!""... Especially when you're NOT doing well?

It really bothers me. Anxiety is something that you simply cannot see from the outside, at least, most of the time anyway. For me, when I am at my most anxious without being nonfunctional, I look pretty good, physically. My hair has to be perfect, I have to wear certain clothes, I have to look presentable in a certain way. Probably because I don't *want* people to know there's anything 'wrong' with me, subconsciously. People as in strangers; I want the people I am close to in my life to know what's going on. I try to be honest. It just gets annoying when they base my physical appearance on how I might be doing emotionally. It sometimes makes me want to never wear make-up, wear the same outfit everyday, and not brush my hair or my teeth so that maybe people would look at me and think, ""wow, she must be struggling"". And when I say my hair has to be perfect and I have to look a certain way, it's not by anyone's standards but my own. I wear what I want and what I like, it's just tailored a certain way. I think it's partially ritualistic for me, especially because if I can look the way I want to, it soothes anxiety. Also if I look good enough in my eyes, maybe I can trick myself into thinking that I feel good. I just hate that it has to be this way at all. 

I feel like this is harder to explain now that I've started typing. It just bothers me. Today my therapist told me I look like I'm doing a lot better. But I'm really not. The anxiety is still just as strong. And I hate that it's invisible. I hate that unless I am frantic and crying or having a panic attack or not leaving my house for weeks at a time, people don't think I'm anxious. They think it's not a problem anymore.

I don't know if this makes sense, but I needed to get it out. And I hate focusing on the materialistic aspect, but when you have social anxiety sometimes it's hard not to. I don't even know what I'm saying. I just feel frustrated about it right now. Thanks for listening, if you did.",14,2014-10-03 07:44:34 EDT-0400

641,Nauseous every morning before work...,"Hello again, friends.

I recently started a new job at Starbucks. I am typically an opening person, which involves me getting to work at 4:30am. But ever since I started doing this, I've felt extremely nauseous as soon as I wake up. I can wretch and wretch, but nothing ever comes up. It's an awful feeling, and it's causing me a lot of anxiety (look in my post history; all of my posts are about health anxiety). I've always had a sensitive stomach, but nothing like this has ever happened. It was at its worst this morning, where my body just was not convinced it had nothing to expell, and I could not leave the bathroom. Any thoughts?",17,2014-10-04 16:38:33 EDT-0400
642,Co-Workers making fun of me behind my back...I just don't know how to not be a target.,"I was speaking with a fellow co-worker today while bored (work is quite slow), and we admitted a lot of sad stuff to each other about this work place. She told me that there were two staff members (one who is gone due to off-season), who would make fun of me behind my back. One is a 22-year old who I am not surprised about in the slightest, but the other was one I wasn't expecting. I'm 25 years old and suffer from high anxiety. 

I've had people make fun of me over the years. I'ma little eccentric but generally a hard worker. But I can see why I'mgood at being made fun of for.  I don't recall ever making fun of this one co-worker ever, or being mean to him. 

The thing is, for whatever reason, hearing this news devasted me. I know that some may argue that she shouldn't have told me, but I honestly appreciate it. 

When she told me, my stomach dropped. I felt weakened. I recalled all of the incidents where I never seemed to fit in, where people made fun of me being my back or to my face. 

I feel like I've never been able to fit in. I do have a wonderful long-term boyfriend and I have close friends. 

And while I do see some people being made fun of, I just...don't understand why I'm always a target. I try to be nice. I don't participate in rumors. I always try to please. 

But now I'm upset and sore. I know this isn't an isolated thing and it will continue to happen. I have zero confidence. 

I've tried figuring out why. I look in the mirror and I see nothing wrong with me. Sometimes, I feel ugly, but when I look at pictures I feel like I'm very cute and normal. But when people treat me badly, I feel like it's because I'm broken in every way. Looks, personality, everything. I just feel broken. 

I know I'm not the centre of the universe. But sometimes I feel like I am. This one girl who makes fun of me is (in my opinion), an awful individual, but there's no way she's going to stop. 

I just need to know I am not alone in the isolation. That there are other people who try, and fail, and end up being targets.  

I just want to be who I am. Eccentric, happy to sell. I have many reasons to be happy. Some close friends. But I let these bad groups of people get me down. 

I'm trying to breathe lol. And work. ",28,2014-10-06 01:59:25 EDT-0400
643,I need to know how to help my girlfriend,"Hi Reddit. A bit of background: I am in a nearly 3 year relationship with my partner. She has always suffered from pretty mild anxiety about basically anything that can take hold: money, friendships etc. Despite this, we still get along fine and I can still see her being ""the one"". I've lived with her nearly one year.

Over the past six months however, she has taken a serious downward spiral with her anxiety and she is now becoming depressed. I am deeply concerned, not only for her but for our relationship in general.

For a bit more context, her main bouts of anxiety concern a fear of the unknown. The best example is that I'll have to get out of bed a few times before we go to sleep because she wants me to check that all our electrical appliances are switched off, because despite the minimal chance of anything going wrong, our house will blow up and kill us both if anything is left switched on. If the door lock isn't checked, a lunatic might come in and kill us both.

She is reaching the point where she can't leave the house by herself anymore, because in her mind she does not trust herself/can't cope with the responsibility of being the last person out of the house in case the 0.001% chance of the house blowing up/flooding/being broken into actually came true. 

She has also started struggling immensely with her personal relationships. Whenever she goes out to see her friends she will always have a fun time, but as soon as she gets home she's crippled by thoughts of ""Oh, I hope I didn't say anything to piss anyone off"" or ""I hope I didn't upset anyone"". 

She herself describes it as  ""things being too good to be true, and I'm expecting something to go wrong"".

I'm really at the point where I don't know what to do. The last few nights, she's had to cry uncontrollably to relax herself and relieve the stress that her condition is starting to put on her. The most frustrating thing is that she knows the basis of her fears are completely ridiculous. Leaving a wall outlet switched on overnight is not going to cause an electrical fire that kills us both. Her friends aren't part of some devious scheme to pretend to like her. I'm not going to get run over when I cross the street to get milk. She can't convince herself that a minimal chance of something isn't worth worrying about. In her mind, even a tiny chance of something going wrong means it's going to happen, even if the circumstances are totally out of her control.

I've tried everything I can think of to convince her that she simply doesn't need to feel how she does.

Speaking selfishly, I don't know where it leaves us if she keeps getting worse. No doubt that I love her, but she's barely coping with everyday life. How will she cope if we move house/have children etc. When she's having a good day, we're great together. We make each other laugh and truly love each other...but these moments are becoming fewer and further between. She has no drive. No get up and go. She lurches from one day to the next, her thoughts cloudy and depressing.

She has an assessment for Cognitive Behavioural Therapy on the 20th. I'm seriously hope this helps her turn the corner. If not, I seriously fear for her, and us. She's already reliant on me to the point I don't feel like I could ever leave her in case something horrible happened...but at the same time, her condition is now dominating everything about our everyday life. There's no space for me to have any issues or problems, fears or concerns. And as callous as this sounds, it's not fair on me either.

Thanks for listening, Reddit. Any advice is welcome.

644,Anxiety decreased by 90% due to sobering up.,"It may sound weird but I've been an alcoholic for the past 3 years. In those 3 years my anxiety went from minor to severe. It got to the point that if I could leave my bed I still wouldn't leave my bedroom. Today will be 5 days alcohol free for the first time in the 3 years pretty much. And I won't ever go back to it. I haven't felt this good in years. I have been driving, going outside, I'm calmer, more relaxed, and I even sat in traffic trying to get to target to buy Super Smash Brother 3DS. It has only been 5 days and with drinking for the past 3 years I'm sure the withdrawal is gonna be rough when it happens but overall nothing negative came from this so far. I'm here to support anyone that self medicates to relieve anxiety. It may not relieve mental issues completely but it can't be bad for you either way.",8,2014-10-03 22:12:40 EDT-0400

He was very upset about it which makes it even harder, but he just hasn't been able to reciprocate the feelings I feel towards him for the past many months. We didn't yell or argue he just said it wasn't working and isn't meant to be. 

I keep hoping he will come back but I know that won't happen. I wanted to make things better so badly and was willing to fight for it and he wasn't.. I have no idea how to be on my own again and I feel like I can never be with another person. It doesn't help that my depression and anxiety has been at an all time high lately and this is just going to make me crumble. I have no idea what to do with myself and I don't know how I can go back to functioning, working, sleeping alone and living a normal life. He was my comfort and now it's gone. I've been trying just to sleep but every time I close my eyes I start thinking and crying. Only slept about 2 hours while waking up in the middle and haven't gotten any sleep since. I stayed at my moms house last night and I don't know how I'm going to go home and walk in my apartment with memories of him all over. I just don't know. I can't see a future without him in it.

652,I actually drove.,"Okay so it was less than 5 minutes in the middle of the night with almost no cars on the road but I did it. I actually drove on a street. With stop lights. My SO was in the car with me though telling me exactly what to do.

I'm 25 and just learning to drive. I've had a lifelong fear of driving and on my 25th birthday (April 19) I felt extra pathetic because my SO told me his little 16 year old sister was learning to drive and I said FUCK IT and decided to finally learn.

I started in parking lots, then I've just been doing back country roads with no stop lights, just stop signs. Then tonight at 1am I went to a little Walmart with my SO. 

Part of me is excited because I never in a million years thought I'd ever drive on an actual road, and another part of me is just.........disappointed that I wasted all these years. I'll be 30 in 5 years and I'm just now learning how to do things that normal people learn at 16. I feel very pathetic and immature. I know I need to think positive though.

Oh and the actual driving was nerve-racking, I wouldn't have been able to do it without my SO telling me exactly what to do, but he said I did perfect, so that's good news.",74,2014-05-05 10:53:53 EDT-0400

661,I actually have a positive story!,"And as I'm writing this all out the anxiety in my brain immediately jumps to ""you're jinxing yourself by writing this out!""... but fuck you brain, I'm going to enjoy my moment!

First - I just started on week six of zoloft and I'm finding myself actually feeling better.  In little ways it seems - I need less xanax, I find myself reading again and enjoying it, I'm not dreading the night and going to bed (previously nighttime laying in bed meant panic attack time), I find myself now and then being more mindful - enjoying the view, feeling the breeze on my face, little things I didn't even know I was missing.  I'm more talkative, more relaxed, more confident.  Even with sex - which has always been an anxiety inducing experience for me - I'm more relaxed and more in the moment.  More able to goof around in bed and just enjoy it even if we both just end up giggling - I'm not as self aware.

But also I started working at a convienence store.  I used to work in a grocery store back in high school - back before my most recent and most worst bit of anxiety.  I was to the point where I was becoming agoraphobic, extreme anxiety, etc.  I was worried that today - being my first day on the register - would end badly.  But... I just relaxed into it.  I felt like I was right back in high school again - each customer I interacted with only for a few moments so I didn't have time to worry about what they thought about me, what I was saying, etc, etc.  I just... let go.  And it felt amazing.

So maybe I am jinxing myself by writing this all down and maybe the universe does have it out for me - but right now in this moment I feel pretty good.  And if I can go from where I was (3-4 *intense* panic attacks a day for months, xanax, trapped in the house, etc, etc)... I have faith that you all will get there too.

663,"I know that you guys might not care, but I took a step I never thought I would","Totally random, last night I was procrastinating my senior paper (love getting to anxious to work), and I started thinking about being on the west coast after graduation.  I never made many friends here (east coast school) and the thought moving out to a city after living in the woods for so long has been a bit overwhelming for me.  Near the end of May I will be driving across country to California: a city I know from flying through it, a place where I know 2 other people that i trust, looking for a job I doubt i can get.  
So, while putting off my ~25 page paper due in 11 hours (still don't have a solid topic), I recieved an email from Match.com and started making a free profile.  Two hours later I had completed pretty much everything for it and had started browsing through matches to see people i might be able to start relationships with when i get out there.  
My anxiety stems from a mix between social phobia (actual diagnosis) and generalized anxiety disorder, and it has prevented me from participating in most forms of social media for the last 4 years (all my college years nonetheless).  I couldn't do facebook, or twitter, or even something as simple as snapchat. I couldn't even make a linkedin profile for professional reasons. 
This morning when i woke up i was kind of amazed, i realized that i had skipped over all of the social media crap and made an honest profile, pictures and everything, that exposed what feels like the deeper parts of my being.  Even though i was amazed, it put me on edge. But as the day went on i started getting notifications (even though its probably a marketing ploy) from members that checked out my profile, that sent me emails, even that ""liked"" my photos, and it actually started to calm me, even make me smile a bit.  
I know this has no effect on your life whatsoever, but maybe there is one of you that will read it and just give something similar a try, and benefit from it like i have (so far).  My only regret is having spent my money on video games so that i cant afford any reasonable subscription haha.  

tl;dr I made a Match.com profile even though i have not participated in any social media type things since 2010, and it has actually made me feel a lot better (so far). ",20,2014-05-06 05:30:57 EDT-0400

665,"Too many triggers, getting harder to cope","I am a 51 year old man. In the past six years, I had a ten month hospital stay where I received last rites three times, got divorced and remarried, lost two really good paying jobs, moved three times and ran out of medications to treat a chronic disease I have had since I was 20 years old.

I was an abused child, both physically and sexually. I am a recovering alcoholic, and am sober thirty years.

For the past three years I have had panic attacks that wake me from sound sleep, cause me to throw up and can freeze me in my tracks.

It is getting harder to cope. My wife is wonderful, but I am wearing her out. I can't focus. I am on Xanax ER and antidepressants. 

I dread going to sleep. Every time I hear about someone losing their job, I have weeks of panic attacks. I have been in talk therapy for years and years.

I feel like I am losing it. I dread going to bed. I dread talking about my anxiety and panic. And I feel like a total fraud and loser claiming thirty years of sobriety when I have so little peace in my life.

I am doing things I never did before. I am waking up, pulling the covers up over my head and texting my boss I am not coming in. Then I sleep until four or five in the afternoon.

I am afraid my wife will leave me if I don't get this under control, though I have no reason to believe this. I am afraid I will lose my job. And I fear most that these will become self fulfilling prophecies.

672,My treatment has helped a lot and I ended up writing about it.,"I wrote this today (it will become obvious why I ended up writing if you read it, heh). I've had treatment for anxiety and although it's still a part of my life and something I encounter on a daily basis, it's now something I can deal with. Maybe this will reassure you that you'll deal with it too one day :)

I have generalised anxiety disorder (or GAD), which basically means I am capable of worrying a disproportionate amount over almost nothing. Or, worryingly often, actually nothing. I’ve come a long way in dealing with it which is something I am really proud of. The thing is, this doesn’t mean it’s gone away or suddenly become easy; dealing with it is hard work, it took a lot of learning to do and of course, isn’t completely failsafe.

My anxiety usually takes the form of “checking”. At the most basic level, I’ll latch onto something inconsequential, usually relating to my interactions with another person. Maybe I only spoke to my boyfriend very briefly before we both left in the morning or I snapped at someone I didn’t want to upset. Then I feel like I have to think over everything that happened to make sure nothing “went wrong”. When this gets bad, it spills over to most or all interactions with other people. I end up desperately trying to remember every line of a conversation so I can check it. This sort of ruins all interactions with other people. That friendly conversation with the bloke in the post office? Better obsess over it until I’ve forgotten that it was cheerful and can only be stressed over not knowing exactly how he replied to me over one little thing. And it’s even worse for interactions with my nearest and dearest.

When things are super bad, the checking affects everything. I sit there and it’s like a voice in my head says “Is anything going wrong?” once every minute. Simple tasks like going into town or talking to acquaintances become really upsetting. Tears happen. Although I don’t actually hear a voice in my head, it feels like my brain is split into two parts: one logical one which looks out and tells me there really isn’t anything to worry about, and a really noisy panicking part which is screaming “WHAT IF THERE IS SOMETHING GOING WRONG? WHAT IF YOU JUST NEED TO THINK ABOUT IT MORE BEFORE YOU CAN IDENTIFY THE PROBLEM AND SOLVE IT? HMM? WHAT COULD BE WRONG?”

The shouting panicky voice gets sort of hard to ignore. I swear it actually gets louder if I’m trying to focus on work or even trying to relax.

Luckily I have had a lot of help with GAD. I’m pretty sure it’s been with me all my life but I finally decided to go to the doctor’s once I couldn’t get through a day without breaking down in tears and panicking about something. (To anyone reading this: you really don’t need to wait this long. Especially in the UK where we have the NHS, go tell your doctor if you think you worry even a bit too much. See what they can do for you.) Because I’d had other similar doctor’s visits before (I also have a big problem with trichotillomania or compulsive pulling out of my hair and had a lot of OCD traits in my childhood) they gave me antidepressants to get me started. Yes, I did have to think very carefully about taking them. Yes, they did make me super ill for the first month. I was dizzy, my sleep cycle went out of the window, I lost a stone, I got a stomach upset. But in the end the side-affects went away and I am pretty sure the pills have helped. I tried to look at it like this: I take hay fever pills every day or I’d sneeze too much to function. I take the contraceptive pill every day or I’d be too pregnant to function. And now (just for a bit – the doctor and I both agreed I would come off them at a time when I had less external stress in my life, because this was during my final year of university and a lot of family problems) I take antidepressants, or I’d be too worried to function.

The thing is, you don’t just want to rely on a pill and by itself it won’t fix the problem anyway. I also started Cognitive Behavioural Therapy with the university’s counselling service. (Hello again, reader. Do you have a problem at uni? Go and see your counselling service. They’re free and almost certainly helpful and useful. You will only be able to use them while you’re at uni so grab that resource while you can. Their waiting list here was much shorter than the NHS too.) This then lead to a group therapy session. 

CBT takes a lot of work because it just gives you techniques to help yourself. We were given so many – gradually, over weeks, so we could try them out. My goal was to spend an entire Sunday relaxing without getting into a cycle of checking and spiralling out of control until I was all upset. For me, the techniques that work best are:

•	Weighing up the evidence. You take the worry and make it into a statement. “I should be doing more work towards my exams.” (There are usually “distorted” words in these statements; “should” is the example here, because it suggests there is some perfect moral course of action I’m obliged to take. So you point out to yourself that that’s not the case and you needn’t use such language.) Then you weigh up the evidence. Should I? Well, it’s a month until finals, so I do need to work hard. But I am already doing a good 6 hours a day 6 days a week. I reckon I don’t need to be doing more at this point.

•	Delaying the anxiety. I can sit there in the library unable to work because I need to “solve” something I’m worried about. “Something is going wrong!!!” the panicky part of my brain is shouting and it won’t leave me alone until I actually FIND something for it to obsess over, and then we’ll be obsessing so we’ll be no better off. I write myself a sticky note that I will deal with the problem at 6.30. Two things happen then: my mind can shut up, because it hasn’t got to cling to that worry, to remembering that we need to check, to checking. We’re okay because we’re going to do it at six thirty and if we forget, well, we won’t because of the sticky note! Secondly, when it gets to 6.30, I usually feel fine. But the lady who ran our CBT group said it’s still important to deal with the anxiety or you’ll lose faith in this technique, so I weigh up the evidence or, like now, end up writing a two page word document.

Writing was actually a technique I employed a lot before the class but in a much less positive fashion. I’d feel better for a bit because my worry was on paper and not in my head but then it would return and I’d have to make sure my paper version exactly matched the version in my head… that it perfectly explained why I was worried… and it escalated again. The lady who ran my group called this a “safety behaviour” – something you do to relieve anxiety in the short term but which actually undermines your long term ability to deal with it. My main safety behaviour was (and still is – I still have to be mindful of this and avoid doing it) reassurance seeking. I’m worried? Better call my mum or my boyfriend and check with them that nothing is wrong really. The thing is, coming to rely on other people isn’t very useful. They’re not always available (although they make themselves available which is a damn amazing thing to do but not their purpose in life!) and I need to be able to cope, at least to a degree, alone. Otherwise things will escalate and I will have a massive phone bill. So we used hierarchies of small changes to try and overcome our safety behaviours. (I only semi used this technique because I found myself using my safety behaviours so much less anyway as I overcame the anxiety. However, I still think it’s incredibly important to be mindful of them.) Other safety behaviours that I used not so much were obsessive writing, eating and procrastinating.

This morning I was very anxious – I’d found some little statements to worry about and the big empty space where I move away from my boyfriend after exams was weighing down on me. So I said look, deal with this later and do some work in the meantime. I promised myself that I’d write down the fears I had this morning once the evening came. Although I have a bit more perspective and they’re not so scary now, here goes. (Remember to use the evidence technique, you have to turn them into statements – so “Is this wrong?” becomes “This is wrong.”)

""What if after exams we don’t make enough plans to meet up and I get mardy when I shouldn’t and I just worry about not seeing each other when it really is fine and we can cope? What if I end up being daft about who organises meeting up and get all butthurt if it’s mostly me? What did Tom mean last night? What if everyone thinks I go on about my anxiety too much and it’s too much of a burden on them, like my mum’s depression was on me when I was 15?""

Okay, maybe my perspective has gone a little too far – I didn’t use the word butthurt when I was panicking, the problems seemed real and insurmountable. But now I can quite clearly see that a lot of them are irrational or, whilst still possible areas for concern, much smaller than I thought they were. Another part of the class focussed on sitting with uncertainty; some of these things are uncertain, like what will happen in the future, but this is natural and you simply have to learn to accept it and sit with it.

Also, my worries do seem to revolve around my close relationships, which makes me want to stress that I have very positive relationships with my boyfriend and family, not ones that need worrying about at all. I think there must be some underlying reason my worries dwell on these things (my CBT lady suggested this) like fear of losing them – not that I’ve delved deeply into this but maybe it arises from my parents breaking up in such a drawn out way through my childhood. The CBT lady told me that addressing your behaviours and worries can actually help break down underlying assumptions (for example: “Something will go wrong in my personal relationships”), which I scoffed at initially but now strongly believe. So just in case somebody I love reads this: I do love you, the logical part of my brain knows we’re fine, but the screamy part is just so scared of losing you it’s going to shout MAKE SURE YOU DON’T SCREW THAT UP! GOOD GOD! BE CAREFUL! CHECK NOTHING IS WRONG! whenever I let it.

Writing this has been pretty therapeutic and reassured me that I can and will be okay. Right now my finals are approaching and even though my anxiety attacks don’t always seem to be related to them, the underlying level of stress they cause is bound to be a part of them. My lovely doctor even said this would happen and that I mustn’t worry because even healthy people have problems with worry at this time! And my CBT lady would tell me to be my own “compassionate coach”. I am grateful for all of these people and my boyfriend and my family who do look after me. I try to remember it is not their purpose or responsibility but at the same time their care is something they freely give (aren’t they genuinely amazing). And I can cope and I will cope.

673,Why Do I Always Get Anxious When My Girlfriend Goes Out With Her Friends?,"Hi there /r/Anxiety,

So, this has been going on for a while. My girlfriend and I have been dating for about 5 years now, and this has been happening for about the past 2 years. 

When we go out, it's always fun and enjoyable, but whenever she tells me she's out with her friends, or I see on Facebook she's doing something with her friends, I suddenly become very anxious which leads to me being depressed. 

I hate when this happens, I thought it would help if I went to some of the places with her, but it didn't change much. I love her to death, and am totally fine with her going out with her friends, I think she needs to be around other girls and not just me all the time. But I hate getting anxious when I find out she's with them...don't mean to sound obsessive or controlling.

Would appreciate tips, stories, experiences, etc. 

Thanks",13,2014-05-04 10:00:05 EDT-0400

683,"Constantly scared of ""getting in trouble"".","Today I realized that a good percentage of my social and communications issues come from the idea that I believe I'll somehow ""get into trouble"" if I do or say the wrong thing. I don't know if this is true or not, but when I was a kid (13-21) any time I told my folks I was making a change in my life, they'd blow up at me.


If I was getting a new job, it'd be a screaming match about how I shouldn't have quit my old job. If I was going to spend the weekend with my girlfriend, it'd be about how they hated my girlfriend and I should be studying instead. Any time I changed something, I'd get yelled at, and then if I thought about it and decided to change back, I'd get yelled at again. For the past two years they've been switching between ""if you want to go to grad school after you just left undergrad you're an ungrateful little shit"" and ""if you don't go to grad school you'll never get a job because your degree is useless"".


They hate my girlfriend because she was born and raised in a town my band and I got mugged in once. The mugging wasn't actually that scary, and I handled it better than most of the people there. Gearing up to tell my folks about it was so scary it physically hurt, which none of the people in the band understood. 


I don't know if this actually made a difference in the way I view people but for some reason I see authority figures, professors, cops, even guys who are younger than me but more confident as ""scary"" and I feel like if I do the wrong thing I'm constantly going to get yelled at or get in trouble. This whole past year I'd skip appointments with professors because I thought my work wasn't good enough and I'd get yelled at. I avoid driving as much as possible because I'm afraid I'll get stopped by the police or someone on the road will think my driving isn't good enough.


Thing is, I love my parents, and they're not like this all the time, only when I try to change something happening in my life. How the fuck do I get over this?",14,2014-07-06 20:12:30 EDT-0400
684,[NSFW] I'm pretty sure my anxiety has prevented me from ever having an orgasm. How can I deal with this?,"Title basically says it all. I'm a 24 year old female, and I've never had an orgasm. In fact, I don't even masturbate because I feel like it never goes anywhere so there's no point in wasting my time. Sex feels great, but I'll never climax. For most of my life I've just sort of accepted that I may be one of those people who will never experience an orgasm. 

Well, I don't want to be that person anymore because I think I realize now that my constant anxiety is almost like a mental barrier preventing me from release. I used to think I had no sex drive, and now that I have a much higher sex drive than I used to I'm enjoying sex a lot more, but I still can't get over that stupid barrier and have an orgasm. I can get so close, too. I know that it's just right there within my reach but I never get there. 

It's frustrating for my girlfriend, too, because she thinks she's not doing a good job. She's actually the best sexual partner I've ever had, but she feels inadequate because I can't orgasm. Believe it or not that doesn't add too much pressure on me because I've explained it to her. Most of the pressure comes from being frustrated with myself. It's nearly impossible to relax completely during sex. I'm always wondering if she's okay down there or if I taste okay, maybe I didn't shave close enough or I missed a spot. All these stupid thoughts going through my head that I can't get rid of even when my girlfriend is making me feel fucking amazing. I just want those thoughts to piss off for a little while, you know? 

Does anyone have any tips for how you handle anxiety during sex? Not to be frank, but I feel like I'm more than due for an orgasm. ",34,2014-07-03 21:32:49 EDT-0400
685,I just had a major breakthrough,"I was finally able to step back and examine the root causes of my social anxiety and really understand where it comes from. For me my fears and anxieties come from assuming something negative will happen to me. I feel silent judgement from every stranger I walk past on the street even though I know logically it's all in my head and that in reality they barely notice my existence.

I realized that I had a shallow opinion of people and that I measure my self worth, my value as a person based on that opinion. I don't believe these views were something I was born with but rather something I learned from my bad childhood. I was bullied a lot and told I was worthless which has made me afraid to be around people. I fear going back to that state of helplessness and being treated like nothing. So I avoid people. I can't embarrass myself or be thought less of by other people if I just avoid other people all together.

For me it goes back to having no self esteem and no self worth. I try to find value in myself by other peoples and my parents validation of me. I should have no natural fear of people especially strangers because they don't know me. If they make a shallow surface judgement of me as a person that shouldn't affect me internally. I shouldn't place value and truth in that judgement. Assuming the worst scenario could happen puts me into a state of fear, panic and anxiety. I feel anxiety because I am constantly flinching from imagined threats to my self esteem.

My lack of self esteem came from poor parenting. I was made to feel utterly worthless every time I misbehaved or broke something. I was always treated like an adult that should already be aware of their actions rather than the small helpless child I actually was. I rationalized away their absurd behavior for many years.

I was spanked hard several times when I did something wrong. In my mind it was like ""well I misbehaved of course that should happen."" It took a long time to understand how toxic that view was. You don't try to modify the behavior of a small helpless child with violence. We don't treat animals that way.

Imagine if the dog pooped in the house. Well I'm angry and that's wrong. So I'm going to kick him hard and ignore his cries and whimpers because he has to learn.

That was the view I had growing up about my own abuse. There was plenty of shouting, screaming and verbal abuse as well. Even now I'm so quiet and try to make as little noise as possible because of the implications it had when I was a child. I never had a voice. When my parents were angry or upset my opinions never mattered. If I ever tried to speak up for myself they would simply scream back ""how dare you talk back to me."" Thus I spent years not talking back to anyone and just taking the abuse because that's what I was taught to do.

Hopefully this post resonates with a few other people who struggling to understand where their anxieties come from.

691,Case of Imposter Syndrome Has me Stuck In My Career,"Hello Internet Friends.  Longtime lurker posting under a throwaway, as you can see.

I was up (way too early) this morning reading r/anxiety when I came across the Dunning-Kruker effect, and subsequently, imposter syndrome.
For those who are unfamiliar, as was I, imposter syndrome is a ""psychological phenomenon where people are unble to internalize their accomplishments.""
This was a huge discovery for me as this is a big way my GAD manisfests itself.   

Over the past few years I have worked my way from a Bachelor's Degree that was effectively useless outside of its field into what others would call a quite successful technology career.  Since joining my current 
company, I have even been promoted - indicating success in my current role.  

However, I constantly am questioning myself - (Do I belong here? I don't deserve to be here.... I am not smart enough to be on this team..., I am too socially awkward for my job, I don't deserve to be leader in my company).   I am surrounded by people with 
better work experience then myself and those with much better schooling, including Ivy League MBAs.   

All of this anxiety and these negative thoughts I fear are hindering my further progress in my career - and driving me generally insane in my personal life.  

Has anyone experienced these sorts of feelings?  How did you get past them?  How did you seperate the rational from the irrational?  

Thanks for your thoughts everyone.  ",6,2014-07-03 17:45:46 EDT-0400

696,[Rant] Unemployment is getting to me,"I quit school when I was 17 years old (26 now) and has since had about 12 jobs and spent almost three, nonconsecutive years being unemployed. 
I've been studying for the last two years so I can finally get in to a university because I grew incredibly tired of hunting jobs I weren't interested in.

The university doesn't start until the middle of august and since the beginning of june I've been sitting at home.

Neither my girlfriend or I had a job when school ended so we had to go to the social services. Here in Sweden we have to be registered at the employment office if we're going to recive money. Both the employment office and social services require us to apply for all jobs (at least twenty per month) of which we're qualified for and report back to them every month.
(I get this, because there will always be people who abuse the system, and the rules are there for a reason.)

Since I've been unemployed for long periods of time before, I knew exactly how my body were going to react: For the first few weeks I'd be applying for everything there is, but the longer I'm at it, the more depressed I get and the anxiety is an unwelcomed, guaranteed by-product.

School starts in about 6 weeks and I just don't see the point any more.

I've been going to a psychologist because of my social anxiety, but she didn't think I'd need it during the summer (plus she's on vacation).

So far I've had one interview opportunity for a job which required me to be at a new work place every week, which basically is my worst nightmare. (I would not be able to handle that many strangers). So, I declined.

Nowadays I only apply for jobs I know I won't get while I sit around being scared that the government will find out that I declined a job offer.

I know that a lot of people can't stand being unemployed, and there's a reason for it: Our lives are on pause. We can't do anything. We're on this constant mission from the government and if we surrender, we'll lose our money and, in my case, probably be homeless (my parents live 1000 km away).

This is the reason I went back to school; so I wouldn't have to apply for jobs I didn't want. It feels like I'm back at square one and two years of studying for nothing.

I know it sounds like I'm looking for a reason to continue leeching of the welfare system so I can continue sitting at home doing nothing, but I don't like it. I grew up with the notion that welfare is something to be ashamed of.

I do not enjoy this cocktail of anxiety, shame and depression. Yuck.",7,2014-07-04 14:58:20 EDT-0400

699,Explaining anxiety to someone who doesn't get it,"So I've hit the problem of explaining my anxiety to just about everything. Unless they experience it, they are unable to relate. So I've been trying to find a way to explain it.

A little background. I'm a 21 year old woman and I have extremely severe health anxiety. My physical state is very poor, struggling with stress induced IBS, poor heart response to activity, and other anxiety related issues, along with the mental fatigue and stress. And being able to explain it at least has helped me rationalize it to a mental problem, not a physical one. So I thought maybe this would help others rationalize it themselves and explain to others.

So we all know someone who likes to scare people. Let's call him Dave. Dave's a bit of an asshole. He likes to walk up behind people and scream ""**RAAAAGH**"" very suddenly to scare people. People have a response to that. Your blood pressure and heart rate change massively. You struggle for a moment, thinking where the hell did that come from? Then you realize what's happened. Dave's pulled a nasty prank. You remark in an exaggerated tone ""Damnit, Dave, you almost gave me a heart attack."". You didn't mean it, but it stands because you felt abnormal, uncomfortable sensations due to what he just did to you.

Dave's become a little psychotic in recent weeks. He's doing it at random, and for some reason, nobody's listening to you when you're telling them he's doing this to you. He starts doing it more and more. You realize after a while that you have a huge build of adrenaline every time, just like the first time, but there's a change in your reaction. Dave has done this so much, that you know it's him within a half second now, not after a few good seconds. Instead, you feel no other choice but to be the victim. You instead focus your energies on the uncomfortable sensations. Wishing them away. But it seems to make them worse. That sinking stomach feeling, even the changes in blood pressure and heart rate. They're very exaggerated, they last longer, and you don't feel good about it.

It has started getting worse. Dave is now doing it all the time. You don't even know what's going on anymore. You spend most of your time very worried about the next terrifying attack he unleashes on you. You are starting to feel very sick. The stress of waiting, the tension and the pain of the screaming attacks he unleashes on you are mounting. You start having digestive issues, palpitations, stress and sleep disturbances.

Every time Dave attacks, he does it in a slightly different way too, which occasionally makes you question just what's going to happen next. Or even what caused him to change his strategy. You start trying to develop defense mechanisms. You curl up into a ball, you listen to music, you do anything you can. Curling up into a ball seems to make you not feel very well. Adopting a defensive position most of the day means you get less exercise of course, and you start feeling worse and worse. You stop leaving your home. You retract from society. 

Dave is now your life. He dictates to you when you get up, when you go to bed, if you leave the house, if you stay inside, how you feel, what's going on. You feel victimized, and although you want control, you are afraid. You notice that Dave *does* let up when you take positive action, such as exercise, or anything, because you're able to get away from him when you're not worrying about him so much, but it doesn't last long. You have little energy at this stage, and he's able to drag you down much easier.

Dave is a very simple metaphor. A metaphor for 'anxiety'. Something that is invisible, unseen by the rest of the world, and exists in the mind of the beholder. Sadly, he sneaks up in a form we often can't understand. We can't hide from him. He just is. 

People like to tell us what to do to overcome. But the further into severe anxiety we are, the worse it can become. Many say ""Life is hard"" when they have to work hard to make ends meet, and keep up with their own household. But with people having panic attacks, they can burn through that sort of mental energy in a day just coping with going through the disorder. To put in the extra effort requires some unknown amounts of strength, consistently, with no let up. And it becomes an impossible uphill climb when you can tumble back down within a matter of minutes.

And anxiety wins every time.",12,2014-07-03 06:35:50 EDT-0400

I am 25, from Texas and have been scared of driving for years. I failed the four other times partially because of how poorly I handle tests when my anxiety is high which causes very bad tunnel vision. Today I passed! I can now buy a car and drive alone.

707,"After 15 years with Anxiety and OCD, here's my two cents.","I've had anxiety and OCD before I knew what anxiety and OCD were. I guess you could say I'm the hipster version of mental disorders...anyways, I've learned a lot in the last decade and a half and I wanted to share it with you here, because I love this subreddit!

1. Therapy is important, don't give up on it.
I've seen four therapists in my lifetime. I've moved three times. Each time I moved, I thought ""New life, new environment, new mind."" As many of you know, this is not always the case with anxiety. Battling it takes work and help. Stick with your therapist. Find someone who works for *you*, someone who is committed to your wellbeing. 

3. Know the difference between your brain and ""anxiety brain""
Normal you brain is a good, well-rounded person with all of the potential and opportunities in the world. Anxiety brain wants to stop this. Only recently did my therapist tell me to treat my anxiety/OCD as the ""other""; an ugly creature that was not a part of my being, but just an unwanted passenger I had to kick out of the car. That ugly passenger isn't just going to jump out willingly, it will hang on to the edge of the car door while you're speeding at 90mph. But the weaker and quieter it gets, it's a lot easier to turn the radio up and drown the sonofabitch out.


3. Anxiety will never completely disappear and that's okay. Contrary to popular belief, coming to this realization made things a lot easier, I became more content. I realized this is something that will be with me forever, so now what? I continue to progress myself. 
It's like buying a house. You know what's wrong with everything and what can be improved, but it won't all get fixed in a day. You have this house for life, you have the rest of your life to make it something proud of and to be proud your fixing it along the way.

I hope these help and reach at least one person in a positive way. You guys are great, keep participating and supporting each other and being awesome as always! ",17,2014-07-17 06:59:45 EDT-0400

I really don't want to be the person that tells my future BIL who he can be friends with, and I really don't want to be the person that brings up the rape every time I'm stressed.

This happened a long time ago, and I was the guy's only victim. I honestly believe he changed, and is no longer dangerous (however, I will NEVER trust him, and have no desire to see or speak to him ever).

I am still afraid of him, and every time he is brought up, I have flashbacks.

The reason I am asking for help is because I believe this is my problem, and I can't ask other people to accommodate me in my anxiety. Most people don't even know what he did to me, and I don't think its fair for me to ruin his life when he isn't a threat to me or anyone else. If I felt he was a threat again, I would definitely speak up, but for the time being I don't think he deserves a label that he isn't currently guilty of (since I was the only one, and he has since changed his life dramatically as far as I know).

So, what I'm asking is, how do I cope with my anxiety is this situation? What are some tools that have helped you manage your stress and anxiety? 

EDIT: Thank you all so much for your advice and genuine concern. I just called my mom and she told me she will personally make sure he does not receive and invite.

Thank you all for giving me the courage to tackle this thing before it had a chance to tackle me :)

On a seemingly unrelated note, I went out on a date last night with a girl I meet at a wedding the previous week. We got talking about work and I found out she works as a secratery....

...at the place I'm going to get my therapy session...

THe date went great and I really want to see her again. But I don't want her to know I'm seeing a therapist (not this early in the relationship anyway). I don't know what to do. Should I cancel the appointment I've been waiting for so long? Should I just take my chances and go in? Should I tell her about my issues?

721,"[Help] Severe social anxiety, I need to know where to start.","Hello Internet. I've finally come to the point where i realize that I need to ask for help. This is a huge step for me.

I have struggled with severe social anxiety for as long as I can remember. When I say severe, I'm talking 29 years old, been on 1-2 dates in my life. Yeah that bad.

Over the last few weeks, I've entertained the suicide as a serious solution to my problem for the first time in years, and it's terrifying me.

Even with my severe anxiety, I have been able to maintain what would appear as a normal life. I have a good job, I have a few pretty good friends. I think that I am generally well liked.

I've never had a romantic relationship. I'm so ashamed of this that I don't even talk to anyone about it. None of my friends know, it is deeply embarrassing.

For my entire life thus far, I've been ""procrastinating"" on dating and meeting people. It's not that I don't want to meet people, it's that I don't even know where to start. Whenever I have the urge to start meeting people and someday finding a romantic partner, I just end up jacking off and putting it off till the next day.

I've realized that I can't keep putting it off forever. I need advice on where to even start.

One of my problems is that I get so worked up, that I become ""paralyzed"". Whenever I start to have a crush on someone, my mind races, I imagine my entire life with this person, and I can't even muster up so much as a hello.

I'm a bit put off by the idea of dating sites. I'm not some douchebag looking for casual hookups, I don't want to flirt with a bunch of people. I want to find a serious lifelong partner.

I'm also hesitant to the idea of therapy. Whenever I've been to therapy as a teen, it always seemed like I was just being evaluated to see which medication I needed to be put onto. I've been on zoloft, prozac, seroquel, welbutren, and a few more I probably can't remember. None of these medications have actually made me feel ""better"". At best they've made me feel ""emotionally numb"".

Does anyone that's been in my shoes and found their way out of it have any advice on where to start?",10,2014-07-16 06:45:03 EDT-0400

733,I don't like who anxiety has turned me into so I'm finally making changes and getting help.,"Over the last several months, my anxiety has been slowly building and getting increasingly worse.  It has changed me from a happy, enthusiastic, encouraging person someone that's cynical, bitter, and takes everything personally. I've isolated myself from friends, and end up taking out my frustrations on my husband who does nothing but support me.  In school (grad student), I'm no longer someone that people ask for help or advice because I dismiss anything that's not related to what I want, and tend to be off on my own planet.  So last night I made a promise to myself to get better. 

I'm making changes and finally asking for the help I know I need. I just called a new therapist to set up an appointment.  I'm making concerted effort to be more positive and less negative in both my thoughts and my conversations with others.  At night, I'm focusing on being at home with my family and not wasting time online or playing stupid computer games by myself.  I started working out again.  

I still feel like there's a giant hand holding my lungs and heart but I know it's going to start loosening and eventually will go away.  It will be a battle of baby steps, but I took the first one today and I'm going to keep putting one foot in front of the other.  ",17,2014-04-09 20:05:09 EDT-0400

738,I'm terrified that my anxiety is going to destroy my entire future.,"This is my first time actually posting here. This is going to get long. I'm just in a pretty bad place right now and I don't have any specific questions, I just need to get stuff off my chest.  I'm 15 and have been going to therapy for GAD and also some issues with depression since I was 10. I honestly can't really remember my life without my anxiety and everyone tells me it will get better but even though there are times it gets better for a few months the overall trend is most certainly a downward spiral.  

Three years ago I dropped out of school for about 4 months before switching to a private school with one on one classes specifically for people who need a school tailored to their sports or medical issues or whatever. In the two years since then I have continued to have periods half way through out the year where I miss around 3 months of school.  Just this Monday I went back for the first time since January.  But I'm not ready to be back and I can feel myself getting close to going into another complete shut down. Going to truancy court would probably send me completely over the edge since I've always been the stereotypical ""good kid.""  So I'm not allowed to just try to get better, instead I have to keep swallowing all my problems but the length of time I'm able to do that is getting shorter and shorter.  

I'm just so scared.  The only thing I've had to look forward to for years is going to college and beginning to do what I want with my life but I'm starting to realize my anxiety is not going to be under control in time for that. My intelligence is the only thing I've ever felt confident in, and even then I always get anxious about being too prideful.  But now even that is being ruined by my paralyzing fear of failure that makes me unable to do anything in the first place. I'm so afraid of what schools will think when they see my huge periods of missed school and I'm so afraid that the separation anxiety I get is going to force me to go to school right where I live, which I've always absolutely hated the idea of. I'm sorry this is so long, I just was hoping for some kind words or advice from those of you who have gone to college with anxiety. Thanks so much for reading this. ",29,2014-04-10 16:58:22 EDT-0400

741,Anxiety from criticism or people being upset with you?. What type of anxiety is this?,"How do you describe anxiety that results from criticism or from somebody being upset or mad with you.  It happens mainly at work. I quit my last job due to stress. I had been thinking about quitting as my job as a photographer required lots of travel and I would constantly worry about getting lost or being late. 
My boss was also very critical,  and the day before I quit I was lectured on a mistake I made in my work. I didn't experience a panic attack but I was shaking and later I cried a little. I was unable to stop thinking about it for days. Even now the memory of it causes me pain. I'm currently studying computer programming to find a new career. 

The something happened today. We have a cleaning rota at the apartment I rent and this morning as I left for college I spilled some muesli flakes on the stairs. There was no time to clean it so I decided to do it first thing when I got home. But I was worrying about it all day, because my flatmates are very particular about keeping the place tidy. 

As soon as I got home I found the mess was cleared up and my flatmates confronted me about it. I apologized but I felt so bad I could have cried. I felt utterly worthless and useless. 

I want to get help for this but I don't know what to call my condition. I don't consider myself an anxious person. I'm generally pretty easy going and I've never experienced a panic attack.

742,"""It was just a phase"" - my mum whenever I mentiom my anxiety and depression from a year ago","I'm a lot better now, studying hard in my senior year of school, hanging out with friends regularly and am in a lovely relationship.

Two years ago I felt, well, to put it simply, pretty shit. After months I broke down, finally explaining how I felt to my mum because I couldn't handle it anymore. I ended up seeing a psychologist for a few months until she decided that I was a lot better and was able to cope.

Anyways, it was a terrible period in my life. Whenever I reflect on my days in year 10 and the start of year 11, I'm overwhelmed, it makes me feel sick. For weeks I couldn't get out of bed at all - I missed the last three weeks of year 10 altogether. I hated myself and was scared of everything. I harmed myself badly, too, and still have bright scars to show for it.

Neither of my parents supported me and the only way I got through it was my perseverance and the help of some lovely friends (of course, the psychologist was nice to talk to).

I am very serious and sensitive about this shitty period I went through... so whenever I mention something from then, or if I'm ""having a bad day again"" or if I just want some comfort because ""I feel like self harming again, but I know I shouldn't"".. mum always responds with something along the lines of ""it was just a phase you went through"" or ""you're a teenager, it's your hormones"" or ""are you on your period?"" or she just laughs it off.

it honestly makes me feel like utter shit. How can I deal with my mum's attitude to this? She used to be my best friend, but now I feel like I can't confront her with my problems.",8,2014-04-12 15:34:07 EDT-0400

745,Extreme procrastination/executive functioning issues + anxiety = TERRIBLE combination,"I'm in college and I'm struggling a lot recently/in general (lol when am I not struggling?) I took a leave of absence after a year and a half and went to a therapeutic wilderness program and then residential treatment because of my extreme depression, anxiety and general inability to do school. I lived in Vermont, which was beautiful, and thrived there with the support of *a lot* of people. Now I'm back at my high-pressure NYC school and have to meet with an academic coach 3 times a week (plus 2-hour study hall on Sundays) and therapy twice a week just to stay afloat. It's so so so demoralizing knowing that I'm spending absurd amounts of money, between tuition, rent and mostly these RIDICULOUSLY expensive appointments, just to be able to do what ""normal"" people do. A few weeks ago I freaked out and thought of dropping out/randomly moving to some nice non-city and just taking a break again. But I can't keep running away--I'm pressuring myself so much to graduate and be traditionally successful. Planning on taking 4 summer classes to make up for lost time in treatment and hopefully I'll be able to graduate next year. I haven't given myself a break from the city or school at all since I took a January class over winter break, and all these appointments + commute time (coach and therapist are far from where I live) feels equivalent to committing to a part-time job.

Anyway, I have a lot of anxiety, as well as depression/some sort of mood disorder (was diagnosed as bipolar a few years ago,) as well as ADD and executive function issues. I procrastinate a lot and can never manage to hand anything in on time. (Also, not procrastination in the Buzzfeed-esque sense of ""hahaha I'm so stressed I just watched Netflix instead of doing my paper! wow college!"" More like I can stare at a screen for 8 hours trying to write something and I can't initiate.) I legitimately would not be able to do anything if I weren't working with my coaches. They say we're working on improving my skills so I'll be able to function better and decrease the hours that I work with them, but it's not happening. I'm perpetually stressed and that stress skyrockets right before an assignment's due. I had a homework assignment due today that I blocked out 4 hours today to do--I really thought I'd be able to finish on time. The first hour was with my coach and I got some work done, but didn't really keep up the momentum after she left. Then I got a really anxiety-inducing phone call (that I shouldn't have picked up) and that lasted half an hour. The second I got off the phone I started panicking. I was so riled up and couldn't calm myself down--I should've taken a klonopin, and I still should but of course there's a difference between thinking that and being able to force myself to go into my backpack and get it and get water and take it. (Executive functioning/problems initiating.) So now everything's hitting me at once and I've tried so hard but class is in 20 minutes and I'm skipping and my assignment isn't done and I hate myself. I've been in a bad place lately and feel so shitty. Texted my coach and she basically just said ""Try to initiate. Pretend I'm there. You can do it.""

747,Is there really no hope for me?,"Edit: I'm a lot lot better now, I've overcome a lot in life and am finally without a care in the world. 
I met with a psychologist and psychiatrist, and well, they really did help me tremendously along with the moral support of the people here and at home :)
I feel great. No more of crying or dwelling on negative thoughts.
I look back at the old me and laugh at myself for having wasted so much of my time while no one else really cared how I felt. Anyway, I'm never going back to that dill hole/ pessimist life again :D

I was a boy who would cry at every single thing, just because he was afraid that he is not masculine enough. I was made fun of my private parts and whatnot, and I'd come home and cry out loud and hide myself in a room, so no one knew that I'm crying. I could not even control how I acted in front of people, so my muscles involuntarily contracted in public due to tremendous anxiety.
To those who feel distressed and are totally lost should not lose hope.
If a completely suicidal case like me has improved so much.. then you definitely can

Original Post: -

I have a terrible social anxiety and I have been thinking that I am gay. I'm very sure I am, and I just haven't been able to accept this fact, which is a reason for my horrible and worsening social anxiety. 

When I am in a social situation(at my school), each and every second, bad thoughts about how I am gay and others might find out, come to my mind. My muscles really tense up because I feel my facial expressions are not masculine, and when I get back home from school, my face, head and neck muscles ache terribly. I have to sleep for 4-5 hours to lessen the pain, but it doesn't really help. And I can't do my homework or pay attention to what is being taught in the school. 

I have literally tried EVERYTHING! That cognitive behavorial audio therapy by Dr. Thomas A. Richards.. I've tried meditation, I've read hundreds of thousands of articles and books to get rid of my social anxiety, but maybe I am just not able to accept myself like this. I am NOT comfortable in my body. I feel like I am out of place because no one else is gay where I live. And where I live, people do not approve gay people at all. If I told my family, they would make fun of me, and even not believe me. My friends already make fun of me when I act differently(unlike a boy). However, over the past 5 years, I've been trying my best to behave like a boy so no one has suspected me to be gay. I cry a lot many times at night before sleeping and I can't even control it. I just keep thinking, why me? 

Every day I have school, coaching or any friend coming over, my anxiety and these negative thoughts about sexuality come to my mind. I get HIGHLY ANXIOUS in social situations, and the muscle tension on my face is TERRIBLE!

I am very sensitive about all of this, and I've had a lot of suicidal thoughts lately, so please, I beg, no rude comments.

I just want to know what can I do, or if there is anything I can do, to feel better and get a new hope for life and feel happier and less anxious. Thanks a lot!

753,I get anxiety when people hear music I'm listening to. Finally figured it out.,"For years now, as long as I can remember, I have always had a lot of anxiety and aversion to people hearing me listening to the music I enjoy.  When my girlfriend comes home, or when someone enters my car, I always turn my music off. 

I have had some break troughs - I do play a more generic playlist for the guys at my martial arts gym as we train - but even if someone makes a joke about a song I feel a mix of emotions internally.

I have made it a habit, or more of a compulsive obsession now, to analyze myself and get to the root of my troubles; 'the work to do on myself to be liberated from my problems'.  This revelation has unlocked a huge doorway to my personal healing and anxiety as a whole.

I knew it was related to fear of self judgement, as it's a common trend amongst other expressive problems I have, but I never understood it with such clarity.

So here's what I wrote down in my notebook. Hope this might help someone else.

---------------------------------

Why do you do <it> -- even when the music isn't even 'bad' or 'experimental'?  Sure, you have a history of people making fun of your music tastes, from your mother dancing sarcastically to it as a child to your friends belittling you as a teen, but why?

Fear of being judged.  I get that, the same reason why you get extremely anxious when its your turn to publicly speak or you want to speak out until the anxiety builds so you don't say anything at all...

In your upbringing when you were in a similar experience of being judged, it caused you a mixed bag of feelings:  Emotional pain, shame, embarrassment, anxiety -- all of which you took personal for one reason or another, due to low self esteem.

You didn't want to feel this these feelings, so as a defense mechanism you begun closing yourself down to not have to feel it again.

As a result, you 'hide' your music from people to not have to feel the pain again, like a child learning not to touch a hot stove a second time.

What else are you hiding as a result?

756,Update to my supervisor at my new job lying to me,"http://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/29085o/my_supervisor_at_my_new_job_lied_to_me/

After much deliberating with myself I finally got the nerve to call my boss today.  I explained to him that due to my anxiety I really struggle with having to work more than a couple days a week and I asked if there was any way I could possibly get a couple days off next week to accommodate for that.  I didn't expect it to work, but he went ""oh yeah, completely understandable"" and told me he'd see what he could do and call back later.

He called back about 5 minutes ago and told me he got me two days off in the coming week.  I now have a four day break before going back to work (was going to be three but I have Saturday off now), then I'll work one day and be off for another three before working a couple more.  

I was really nervous about calling him but I took a risk and it paid off.  Pretty proud of myself to be honest.

Now I can enjoy my ~~3~~ 4 day break in peace without worrying about next week :)

TL;DR everything worked out okay and my boss is way cooler than my supervisor.  ",7,2014-06-25 20:30:48 EDT-0400

759,I am not able to interact meaningfully in group setting.,"Usually others dominate a conversation while i am in a group setting. I am rarely given an opportunity to speak. When I do find an opportunity to speak it is usually ignored or I am given a blank stare. On very rare occasions, I am able to get someone to respond to me, or at least laugh.

I've never understood how certain individuals are able to dominate conversations. It is not like they are saying anything extra-ordinary, or speaking more loudly. They just seem to have a gift for grabbing the attention of a group through some sort of expressive and enthusiastic tone.

also on the internet. (like on reddit) people tend to ignore my comments etc. and if they do pay attention, they are happy to point out the flaws in what I am saying and why it is stupid.

I am now just wondering if I actually am crazy. Maybe I have lost my ability to use the English language effectively and lost touch with people to the point where none of my interests/opinions align with theirs.

I am sorry if it sounds like I am having a big pity party... It just hard to be an outcast sometimes. It hurts, no matter how much you tell yourself its just your overactive ego being hurt, not you.

Anyone else have this issue?

I've been anxious since my pre-teen years, and since then I've always felt abnormal around my family/friends. I try to hide how anxious/fearful life in general makes me. I've always felt so isolated because of my anxiety. It was until finding this subreddit that I realized that I am not alone. There are other people that fear talking to people, going to work, and other things that may seem silly to people without anxiety. 

When I read other people's post about hard times they're going through I feel compassion and empathy that I sometimes didn't used to give myself. I used to blame myself for my anxiety, and feel like a failure but I having trying to give myself a break.

So thanks again, the comments and support that some people have given me here mean more then they will ever know. Even if I just rant to myself here, or read other people's rants it reminds me that I am not alone. Also I found a quote here, that I say to myself almost daily, ""Smile, breathe and go slowly.""Thich Nhat Hanh",5,2014-06-27 01:33:50 EDT-0400
770,I had a breakthrough this weekend!,"I've been dealing with panic attacks for 5 years now. Things like going to the store, out to eat, work, and doctor appointments cause me a great deal of anxiety. I've been seeing a therapist for the past 3 years and she has been doing a great job of helping me through. 

First, I was able to sit patiently at the optometrist office and not panic over having to wait. Which is a major thing for me because waiting places has seemed to trigger my anxiety.
Then, I was able to go to the store, by myself, and buy the things that I need but was too scared. I usually make my husband go with me for support, however he didn't want to go shopping so without thinking I just went. 
Finally, I went to the beach. Anything with large crowds pretty much sends me into panic. But I followed my therapists advice and just focused on myself and my husband. 

Now all of this is a good step for me, but I still have an extremely far way to go in order to be myself again pre-panic attacks. 

Every little victory reminds me that I am just as normal as everyone else.

100mg quetiapine

A) My potentially shitty grade and

B) My math teacher reprimanding me.

I know B is a stupid thing to worry about, but I really am scared of how this bad impression will affect future experiences with my teacher. And I mean, the whole reason why I neglect to do the homework is because every time I try, I get a sudden urge of laziness and start making excuses out of it. If i pull it out and try to focus, I get a headache and cannot find a single way to motivate myself. There's always some pit that forms in my stomach that annoys the hell out of me. Not to mention that I have no clue how to do any of it.

Now I feel like I'm trapped between working through the stupidly obnoxious lethargy for the obvious reward and owning up to my wrongdoings and just not doing it and feeling bad about it for the whole day.

789,[possible trigger warning] Did something happen to me as a child?,"First off I apologize for the long story. This is something I've been fixating on for nearly 24 hours straight, since it was initially brought up.

Secondly - there are mentions of sexual abuse. If that is a trigger for you, I apologize, and here is your chance to click 'x'.

I'm having a hard time lately figuring out where my anxiety is coming from. I've always had anxiety and having panic attacks since I was 18, but it's only been in the past two-three months it's gotten to the point where I can't leave my house, I don't feel comfortable in my skin, having panic attacks 1-2 times a day. I've been going to therapy and it's helping a lot. I've seen a psych and she's diagnosed me with type two bipolar, and I'm taking minimal amounts of Seroquel (had a bad reaction and waiting on medication advice from her).

Okay I guess I'll start at the beginning. My memory here is fuzzy and here's where things get weird - because I don't know if this constitutes as sexual abuse, but it's the only memory I have.

We had neighbors my parents were friends with. I was about three at the time. They had a son, R, who was six. R used to lock me in his room and touch me and force me to touch him. I hated it, I really only have one clear memory of it happening (top bunk of his bed, he blocked the view with a giant teddy bear that was like, human-sized) but I have a feeling it may have happened more.

When we moved far away from them I was so happy. I remember when I was about six and had some questions about sex. I nervously asked my mom how somebody got pregnant and when she told me I broke down crying and freaking out. It took a few hours for me to admit to her that I thought I was pregnant, because of what R and I had did years ago. It was very hard to tell her what had happened. I felt dirty and ashamed.

When I was 10 R and his family moved to the island. They stayed with us for a few weeks and I was uncomfortable having him around. I was staying in the top bunk in my brother's room at my dad's house (I was there the whole summer) and one night R (who was 13) was talking to my brother (who was 7). He knew I was awake and could hear them. He was telling my brother loudly how 'sexy' I was, and how he wanted to fuck me. I hated hearing it and asked him multiple times if he could just shut up. 

That summer I stopped eating. I actually had to be hospitalized because I wouldn't eat. I bathed 3-5 times a day with the door locked. I had problems sitting down for dinner. I would eat a bite of food and immediately go run to the bathroom and sit on the toilet for 15-20 minutes, go back, eat another piece of food, and run back to the bathroom and run another bath for myself. I didn't play or anything that summer, I stayed in bed and cried that I wanted to go back to my mom's house. After my visit to the hospital I started eating again, and once I got back to my mom's everything was fine.

At this point I would like to clarify that I've always had issues with my dad - he was overbearing and angry when I was younger. But I know in my heart that he would never have done anything to hurt me, or anything like that. My parents have been at war since they split up and I always chose my mom's side, she was always more comforting to me.

After that I ran into R a few more times, my town was small. He always creeped me the fuck out. One time when I was 14 my dad took me aside and asked me to give him a chance. I guess R had tracked down my dad's new address and gone to ask my dad for permission to court me, which my dad thought was honorable. I told my dad no way in fucking hell would I ever date that guy. I haven't seen him since I was 17 (so 7 years ago) and last I saw he had tried meth for the first time and hadn't slept in a few days. Last I've HEARD about him is that him and his father moved to Nova Scotia, so, good riddance.

In the last few months my anxiety has flared up much more than normal. I'm agoraphobic. I freak out anywhere in public. But there have been some things I've started becoming concerned about.

I have a problem with my gag reflex. Most of the time I walk around choking myself and holding my throat. My stomach feels fine, but my throat just wants to retch. My mom's neighbor and best friend noticed it and asked my mom if I had ever been abused as a child. 

I still hate eating. I've always had a real problem with food. I eat once a day normally.

My boyfriend and I haven't had sex in over a month. We've been together a little over a year and I love the hell out of him. We've always had a very normal, healthy and loving sex life (if anything, a little too vanilla for me), but it's been over a month due to my anxiety that I just feel like I cannot. I also have been sleeping on the couch most nights. I think out of the last month I've spent 3 nights beside him in the bed.

I've always had a problem with pelvic exams. I have horrible panic attacks when it comes to doctors performing pelvic exams on me and I avoid them at all costs. 

When I first had sex **I did not have a hymen**. This concerns me a lot. The first time I had sex I felt nothing - no pain, nothing good. There was no barrier, no pressure, no bleeding. I didn't ride horses, do gymnastics - there is not many other options for why I wouldn't have a hymen.

Tampons are sending me into a shock-spiral. Not TSS. I just started my period and I tried to insert a tampon. I had it in for about 3 hours and I had a horrible panic attack and dizziness ensued. I thought it was TSS but there is no way. As soon as I removed the tampon, I started feeling much better. I haven't used one since and it has not occurred again.

Baths are also now a place of great discomfort for me. I used to love having relaxing baths and it's only been in the past few weeks/months that every time I get into a hot bathtub my mind spirals and I cannot concentrate on anything except fear and panic.

I'm sorry this is so long. I'm off to talk with my therapist about all of this in an hour, but I just sort of had to get it off my chest.

I'm not sure what happened with R. I only remember one thing. I'm not sure if that's even construed as sexual abuse, or if it's what is manifesting within me right now. Part of me feels guilt for even suggesting it because I know that thousands of people endure abuse much worse. I'm definitely minimalizing it in my mind and trying to convince myself it was something normal, childhood experimentation, but I remember crying and saying no, and how dirty and ashamed I felt when I had to tell my mom.

I'm also wondering if anything else happened that I can't remember. I'm wondering why I didn't have a hymen. I'm kind of afraid of all of this. I'm looking forward to opening up with my therapist about it. It's the first time I've ever really explored my past in this way, especially with what happened with R, and it's almost putting the anxiety at bay - like there is something strong within me.

Sorry for the long post guys. I'd love opinions or thoughts. ",14,2014-09-16 22:52:45 EDT-0400

797,Going to new places alone.,"I would like to hear some tips and tricks to feel more comfortable going to new places alone. For me, the anxiety isn't just about the place itself, but ""how it works"". 

Examples: 
- Do I have to pay a cover for this bar? Do they accept only cash?
- Do I have to wait to be seated at this restaurant or should I take a seat myself?
- Does this building have a weird elevator system? Like a row of elevators only for certain floors?
- Do I have to ring an intercom to get in this building?

I normally do an EXTENSIVE search of the place I'm going to before heading out (google street view, reviews, etc). A friend had to literally walk me through the university library when I needed a book during my last year of undergrad school. I had only used google books and/or bought the books I needed before that. ",5,2014-09-21 19:03:12 EDT-0400
798,Anyone else too anxious to drive?,"I'm so frustrated by this. I'm 29 and I've never been able to get my driver's license because I panic every time I'm behind the wheel. Until I was about 24 it wasn't such a problem because I lived in a city with great public transit, but since moving to my current location, it's very difficult to get around. I have overactive guilt and feel awful about asking people for rides, which means I rarely get to see my friends. And then I feel guilty because I want to be more involved in my community and do volunteering, but can't because I can't actually get around. Aaaah! Not to mention that I feel selfish if I vent about this issue to people close to me because they're already suffering by having to give me rides.

I know that there's a huge cognitive issue here. When I was learning to drive as a teenager, on the way back from a parallel parking session I freaked out, hit the wrong pedal and drove through a fence. I had probably the worst panic attack I'd ever had at that point, and couldn't stop thinking that there could have been a child behind that fence (or a dog. I know it's ridiculous, but I love dogs and if I hit a dog I'd about die). Now every time I try to drive I can't stop thinking about how big and fast the car is and how easily it could seriously hurt or kill someone if I made a mistake. I hear my friends who drive say that they can't stand being driven in a car by someone they don't trust... but I don't trust myself. And then I feel like a bad person because I live a passive life. 

The other relevant thing I guess is that my dad is an alcoholic and abuses prescription drugs, and he's a truly scary driver. I have a lot of anger and resentment about how many times he's endangered our family by driving us when he was under the influence. So I think that's part of why it's such a hot button for me too.

My umpteenth learner's permit expires in October. I don't think I can get my license by then, even though I've put in a ton of practice over the years and intellectually I know /how/ to drive. I just psych myself out every time. I doubt posting this is actually going to solve the problem for me, but it's something that I get upset thinking about almost every day so it kind of helps to vent about it.

Making their answers ahead of time? 

Inevitably though, when I find myself confronted with the things that trigger my A&D (or perhaps when I'm removed from the things that alleviate it) any pretence that I'm fabricating these things is immediately destroyed and I return to the blubbering pile of emotions that I actually am.

814,I dread going to bed,"Yesterday, I had really upbeat day at work. I even enjoyed listening to music on the way, something that lately has been a trigger for me (certain songs place me in a certain place and time.).

Then last night, I take 1mg of extended release Xanax as prescribed, two hours later, wake up in a puddle of sweat, heart pounding and nauseous. I take a quick acting Xanax, go back to bed a fall back asleep. Nightmares and disturbing dreams follow. I wake up two hours later, another panic attack in a pool of sweat, another 1mg Xanax to get back to sleep.

I make to 5am, wake up feeling sick, paranoid, depressed and anxious. This happens almost every night. By 6:30am, I am functioning again and leave for work.

Most nights, the extended release Xanax gets me through the night, but I have been under a lot of pressure at work, and Father's Day is coming up. I have been estranged from my son for five years. I will spend the day with my mentally retarded daughter, whom I love the shit out of, and is one of the lights of my life.

My second wife is wearing down. I keep giving her the analogy, ""No one would tell a guy with a broken leg that if he just maintained a positive attitude, he could run a marathon."" 

The funny thing is, I fought off the anxiety for thirty years by shutting down, something I learned as an abused child. I finally let my guard down to be with the amazing woman, and I feel like I am letting her down.

I can't control it. I carry two emergency Xanax in my pocket pill caddy, but I have never used them. I can get through the day, but I dread the night.

And we have a wild sex life. It is a wonderful diversion. For about and hour. Then the night horrors kick in.

Next week, we leave on Friday for a nine day cruise. No cell phones, not internet, just each other. We come back, I work four days, and then I am off the 4th of July and week after (I have my daughter) and we are spending it at the Jersey shore.

I never felt like I needed a break more, but I, being me, am already putting pressure on myself to have a good time and not spoil her dream trip.

Now, around 8:30, I start tensing up, almost every night, dreading the lights going out. I actually wake up and think about using my impressive array of drugs in my closet to just end this trip once and for all.

I don't want to die, but I can't bear living like this. And the anxiety, after being successfully suppressed for 42 years came on my so bad five years ago, it cost me two jobs and, if I am not careful, could cost me a second marriage.

i don't know what else to do. I am in therapy, I am on meds, I try to eat right but I can't get any consistent rest, except on the weekends I sleep until 2:00 in the afternoon because of the depression.

My life feels like it is imploding. I don't know how to find the switch to turn off the fear and anxiety. It is killing me. It is making my Crohn's hard to manage. It is ruining my life. I can't find relief. ",23,2014-06-12 14:34:48 EDT-0400

823,[Help] Fellow anxious Redditors: How do you make your living?,"I've been unemployed for over a year now and all of my resources have dried up. Unless I go on welfare, which I'm not sure I can and would rather not do, I'm going to have to find work asap.

My employment background is as a project manager within the video game industry. As many of you have heard in the news and elsewhere this career path could be considered non-conducive to a healthy mental state. Be it drugs, alcohol, or pills, far too many of my colleagues were self-medicating just to keep afloat. 

Aside from the initial terror and anguish that a new job will likely bring, albeit temporarily, I will admit I'm far more concerned of landing yet another job where I'm slowly milled into emotional, spiritual, and physical paste. I don't feel I could handle that yet again; third (fourth?) time's the charm? After all, it feels as if one can only reconstitute themselves so many times and I'm so very tired of doing so...

So I'm hoping that some of you might have had some luck or perhaps have some words of wisdom in regards to finding work that both pays the bills and isn't totally adverse to our particular disposition. I recognize that there isn't a one-size-fits-all answer to my question but I'm still quite eager to hear what solutions you might have found.

I was getting more and more agitated as I waited, eagerly avoiding any eye contact from strangers. Than I see a sign that says no money orders and I freak out thinking this means I can't get my money. I'm about to cry

Then I get up and am told that doesn't apply to moneygrams so I say thank you I almost just had the worst day. And then she informs me it still might be bad because my mom or the clerk didn't type in my name right. the state abbrev was put before my name and the clerk on my side told me she couldn't give me the money.

827,My journey through anxiety and how Futurama helped me cope.,"Last year I went through some major life changes and was dealing with incredible amounts of stress.

I suffered from severe anxiety most nights. I’d wake up in the middle of the night and be up the rest of the evening vomiting, shaking, and full of adrenaline. The harder I tried to fall asleep the more anxious I felt. I started to just accept that I would not be able to sleep anymore that night and stay up.

I couldn’t think of the stresses in my life because it would encourage the anxiety. I needed to find ways to keep my thoughts busy and hope to finally fall back asleep.

That’s when I started marathoning Futurama at night. I had always loved the series, but now it brought positivity and comedy into my bed when I had been surrounded by crushing stress. I would fall asleep to Futurama every time I had an attack. I’ve probably seen every episode on average, 6 or more times.

I have since gone to therapy, found ways to manage my stress, and have a better hold on my life. I went from anxiety 3-4 times a week, to an attack once every few months. And when those feelings creep up on me, I turn on Netflix and start streaming my Futurama. It’s my comfort blanket. 

So this is a big thank you to the makers for creating a series full of lovable characters, hilarious plots, and a beautiful ending, all of which have brought me peace of mind when I needed it most.

The point is I know what it feels like to be anxious against driving, I was for years but it will be ok. No one says you have to get your license right at the legal age, sometimes you arent ready like I was but the time shall come amd you will be fine!

I hope this helps someone because these types of posts always help me.",21,2014-11-13 20:59:22 EST-0500
830,"My Mom passed away Friday, I'm having trouble figuring out my state of mind. Sorry it's long.","Quick background, I have had issues with depression and anxiety my whole life. Recently I had been having some trouble getting my prescriptions right and in typical fashion for me I (slowly) took myself off of Lexipro without going to the doctor to get something else. The reasons behind this have more to do with avoiding what I need to do and not because I think I'll be fine without it. I still take a very small dose of Klonopin in the morning and at night. 

So anyway, I got a call Friday morning that ended in me running to my Mom's and finding her dead on the floor next to her bed. They believe she had been gone since the night before. This is obviously traumatic regardless but I am also uncomfortable with death and dead people in general to the point of it being a lot like a phobia. I very nearly had to be sedated that day but wasn't. Btw, I am 46(F) and my mother was 68 and not in great physical condition but I wasn't expecting this. I called my best friend first and was immediately surrounded by wonderful, supportive people without having to do anything else that day.

Here's my question, I understand that I am likely still in shock and it's very early for me to try to fix my mental state but the weird part is I don't understand what it is. I am so hyper and all over the place emotionally. It isn't just general sadness or anxiety. I can't sleep, not because I'm sad or worried but I just feel wide awake. I can't help but feel like I'm always talking really loud and fast. I am in overdrive as far as getting things done but I always feel confused. I have the shakes in a way that I don't usually, it feels like my insides are vibrating.

I'm sorry this is long but I'm looking for some kind of word to explain what this is. It isn't anything I've experienced before. This rambling crazy post is a good example of what's going on in my head. If anyone can offer an explanation that is something I can tell my doctor  even that would be really helpful.",10,2014-11-11 19:00:07 EST-0500

833,"So Long, Don't Ever Feed The Anxiety Troll In Your Head","I'll be leaving Reddit now, as I feel it's not a healthy thing for me to spend hours a day talking about anxiety. I joined for a brief time just to share what has worked for me all these years. My ultimate message is to take charge of your life, and don't let anxiety do it. Do everything you possibly can to put your mind on creative and intellectual pursuits that challenge and fulfill you and that take up a lot of your free time. Remember that anxiety is just a sensation and that it has no power. Remember that the past has no power over the present. Remember that your thoughts aren't real, ""what is"" or ""the present reality"" that you you see is. Know the difference. Don't ever feed your anxiety, which means don't make it your focus, ever. Make other things your focus. Good luck, you all can make progress, if my brain could rewire itself (neuroplasticity), yours can as well. It just needs new challenges to do so. Thanks for the opportunity to share. Love y'all.",6,2014-11-12 17:02:32 EST-0500
834,The practice of staying with current reality,"One of the best things I've learned that has contributed to creating an anxiety free state or as a tool for working through a temporary bout of panic is the practice of staying with current reality, a.k.a the present, or ""what-is."" There is ""what-is"" and then there are the movies and perceptions that play in your mind. Those of us experiencing anxiety are usually immersed in some form of thinking (past, future) or have a certain perception that kicks in that triggers the flight-fight part of the brain, that then gets the adrenals pumping, which causes the feeling of anxiety. Along with involving my mind with creative pursuits that fully interest and challenge my mind for many hours a day, I practice stopping for a few minutes to an hour and describing what is actually happening in my world. I look at the colors, hear the sounds, taste the tastes, etc. Look at faces, what people are wearing. Whatever I can observe. If the perception kicked in where I would start to panic, I immediately would start to observe current reality and describe it to myself. The perception can't maintain itself when I focus in the present. The adrenaline passes within 10-20 seconds, and then I'm fully relaxed. Mindfulness meditation is another way to practice this daily. It's the process of focusing on something like a mantra, breath, music, etc.---and when you find that you are thinking, return to the focus. It's a way to retrain the brain to be focused on actual reality, and not in the movies in your mind. Try practicing refocusing in the present. It can't hurt, and at the very least you'll be living Ferris Bueller's maxim ""Life moves pretty fast. If you don't stop and look around once in a while, you could miss it."" Many of us are missing it. We're off in the la-la land of our movies. :)",13,2014-11-11 17:23:52 EST-0500

837,My 11 year old daughter has anxiety. I need help.,"I have a daughter who has anxiety. She recently suffer a concussion which has heightened her anxiety. She has also recently started Cognitive Behavior Therapy, which is slowly working. We are 4 sessions in and I am starting to see an improvement.

I need advice on issues with her father.  Her father and I divorced 4 years ago and she spends 3 nights a week at his apartment. Fortunately he lives less than a mile away and on school days would drop her off at my house on the way to work and I would take her to school.

This May she refused to sleep at her father's house and he honored her request. In the last six months she has spent a total of 4 nights there.  He asked me to find out why. I did and told him. One of the reasons is he picks out her clothes and makes her change in his bedroom. Well, that set off a big huge red flag in my mind and asked him about it. He told me he isn't in there with her and her younger sister, there is just more room in his bedroom (huh?). He confronted her and demanded she explain herself to him. Never again will I share information with him regarding her feelings.

So, she suffered a concussion which has added onto her anxiety.  I put her in therapy and it comes to light that her father's actions cause a lot of her anxiety. He behavior in public humiliates her. Since he lives less than a mile away he goes to her activities. While at the activities he causes her stress. For example: He does this elaborate hand signal to show he loves her. He insists she does it back, in public, while playing in a basketball game. If she ignores him he confronts her. He corrects coaches and stands and watches every practice. Calls her friends ""honey"" and ""sweetie"",and""baby"". He has been told by others to stop.  I have spoken with him umpteen times to please stop this behavior. He flat out refuses and says our daughter needs to tell him stop. When she does he talks over her and doesn't listen. He refuses to admit she is anxious and openly criticizes the therapist.

He spends time with the girls two days a week for 3 hours and every other weekend for about 12 hours. 

At her last therapy session(she goes weekly) the therapist asked if her dad if she ,the therapist could speak with him. He said no. When I spoke with the therapist she said her father is a narcissist.  I  am not sure how to help my daughter. She feels so much pressure to please her dad. It is eating her alive. She has started sleepwalking, biting her nails, unable to sleep, and she is losing her friends due to her fears and anxiety.

I am so grateful for her younger sister who is 7 years old. They share a special bond and my youngest can soothe my daughter. I know it is an unfair burden to my youngest. 

I just don't know what to. I can't save her from her father. He refuses to listen to me or the therapist.

I just want her to be able to cope. Any advice would help.

tl;dr High anxiety daughter has a narcissistic farther

843,[Rant] Had a panic attack in class today.,Today I had a big test in Math class. As soon as I entered school I could feel something was off but when the test started I just lost it. My head and hands became extremely tingly and I began to shake. I got a dizzy and it became really hard for me to talk and at a certain point I almost started to cry and my eyes became really watery. I guess the mix of working every morning then rushing to get to school and having something almost every night of the week along with trying to keep good grades stress caught up with me. I just don't get why this happened to me. I'm a healthy 16 year old with no other problems other than some mild anxiety. It was really embarrassing to do that in the middle of class. I only finished like half of the test and I know I should ask my teacher if I can redo it but I don't want to be annoying to him or anything. I guess I just wanted to let that out of my system. I just hope this was a once-off experience. I don't think I could handle much more of that. I'm sure it'll get better and this sub is really a great place to be with other similar people.,7,2014-11-13 05:15:29 EST-0500

I recently got hired for an assistant manager gig at a retail store in my local mall. I've been out of the workforce since April of 2012, and that was because I was seriously scared of putting myself out there again. I thought I did awful in my interview for this latest gig, but the manager was impressed enough to offer me a management position. 

Now, i'm practically shaking over my new job. From what I gather, my role will primarily be pushing sales associates to make more sales.

848,"I played paintball today with the people I work with. I almost didn't want to go, but I'm so glad I did","I work at a craft store with awesome and kind people that I absolutely love like another family. I've worked there for about 8 months now, and most people my age (16) either get fired or quit by the 4th month, so I've been doing well. I don't talk much except for the usual customer service thing we have to dk. (i.e. how are you? Find everthing ok? Etc.)
A few weeks ago one of the other employees invited me to go to are haunted house with them. I said yes but got really nervous the day of and didn't show up. Everyone kept on asking me why and said they wished I would have gone. So, when they invited me to paintball I finally went- I had a blast. I talked more and laughed and made friends with some awesome people that are older than me. One even said I'm their favorite cashier (which, according to others, is hard to be a favorite of that person because she's not much of a people person. But she's actually really cool and nice as long as you are on her good side haha)
I was first afraid of how I looked. I didn't know what to wear, I thought I looked ricidulous in my sweats and hoodie, but it worked out fine. Then I was afraid of having to ask for a ride because I don't drive, but one of them told me to hop in her car and we went. I was also afraid of being weird because I have bad allergies this time of year, I was afraid I'd cough or sniffle and everyone would think I was gross. It turned out fine though, I had fun and have a new group of friends, they all said they enjoyed me being there. I was so happy. I thanked everyone and now I'm home.

850,My boyfriend is finally starting to get it :'),"I don't post much but I just wanted to share a huge thing that happened last night.  I've been dealing with anxiety for about 7 years now and it has been decently stagnant over the past year and a half.  A little over a year ago was when I met my current boyfriend.  Anyways, throughout the past year there have been little scares that my anxiety would rear its ugly head, but I was able to cope and control and really pushed myself (especially because I didn't want to scare him off at the beginning).

However, over the past 3 weeks, things have been going a bit downhill, building up to a panic attack a couple days ago and since then I've been seriously on edge, tense, and nervous in between some pretty bad lows.  
Anyways, my boyfriend would get so frustrated when I couldn't explain to him in a simple and immediate way what was happening since he's never dealt with this before and didn't understand (he is a super logical person).  His impatience when times get tough had caused little problems in the past and so it made it that much harder for me to want to open up.

Last night though, he came to my house (he knew I was feeling pretty bad all day and left work early), and he marched right to me and wrapped his arms around me and said ""I'm so so so sorry."" over and over.  He explained he has been reading about anxiety and he's been doing everything wrong - he'd been trying to fix everything, telling me to just stop, getting frustrated... He told me he'd be there for me for whatever I need, whether it's a silent cuddle, a walk in the park, or an ear to listen, and at **my** pace. He'd be there for me as a support until I'm okay.
It meant everything to me. ",22,2014-07-10 16:38:57 EDT-0400

858,Either I'm sleepy or I'm anxious. No middle ground.,"It all started when I took a Claritin allergy tablet. It made me feel slightly stoned. Then I took one a few days later, and I had a near full blown panic attack (throat swelling, hard time breathing, thoughts flooding, heart pounding). I've had 2 panic attacks before, but over a year ago. I had nothing to panic about. No reason to be anxious. I was just going on a hiking trip to camp out with my husband. It was the worst camping trip of my life to say the least. Since then, I've had trouble every time I eat, sometimes when I wake up in the morning, and I absolutely can't sleep at night without a few drinks. 

So, I began trying to meditate and relax myself with breathing exercises. It helps. It helps so much...except... once I relax, I become overwhelmingly sleepy. There's nothing I can do to fight it. Hanging out with friends and don't want to be anxious? ... I just deal with the tiredness. It's either be wound up tight and ready to explode out of my head or take a nap. Naps have saved my mental health, but I fear sleeping so much is depleting my ability to function properly around the house. It makes me look like a lazy asshole. I get things done, but not at half the rate I used to. I'm so confused as to why I've become so sleepy. It's dragging me into a state of depression. ",17,2014-07-09 18:10:38 EDT-0400
859,I get it now.,"I really can't tell you how ill anxiety has made me.

I like to think of myself as the anxiety queen. My symptoms have been extreme, from my heart rate being totally out of control, to complete sporadic nausea and pain on a daily basis, to the point I can't actually control my body to get up to go to the bathroom. It has consumed me.

I was given words by people for years. Words that never meant much to me, because I was too busy being scared. They were saying ""You need to stop checking your heart rate so often. It's making it worse."" but I never could stop myself. My argument was that ""I check it because I'm afraid it's out of control if I don't."". I tried to take control of my own body. I have checked my heart rate 125,000 times in the last year and a half, by my averaging prediction. My brain has been reprogrammed. Completely and totally.

I haven't turned my brain off in 5 years. And it has destroyed me. Because this whole time I've been telling myself the same thing.

That it's not going to be okay. I saw this anxiety disorder as circular. That I was trapped inside of it. But I was trapping myself. By telling myself it wasn't going to be okay, I allowed myself to be out of control, of something I never had any control of in the first place. 

It's not just with health anxiety though. It manifests itself in everything. When I need to go to bed, I sit here on the computer, watching the hours tick past telling myself ""I can't do anything about this."" whilst scolding myself. I do the same with my studies.

I have wasted 5 years of my life being in artificial pain. For the first time, I have a feeling in my brain of complete, and total control over my reaction to having no control.

Oh, I knew his actions/words were ""off"" but I never knew the name for it. His disposition and my illness make for some rocky times. I lost my insurance coverage at the end of April. Working on getting it back. I had been on paxil and xanax (as-needed, which wasn't often after paxil kicked in) since only February.Anyways, the past couple months have been rough. I'd had fucking amazing results with meds. For it to be ripped away...loosing who I was becoming, having a hard time once again dealing with people, driving, kids, boyfriend, demands of raising animals, everyday tasks...Im a mess. Crying, emotional outbursts. Trying to hide it from my kids (11 and 12). Avoiding neighbors. Trying to remember that boyfriend and I work really well together when we're in sync...We live in the country. Someone threw kittens out their car, we figure. It happens. We only caught one and she is so damned affectionate. I'd been previously told, that there was NEVER going to be a cat in the house. He actually let me keep her.She cuddles and purrs. She lays on my chest and sleeps for hours at a time. She plays with the kids, but is just as happy letting them pet her. And she is a little fuzzball that lets me pick her up and hug her, pet her, talk to her.It seems silly in a way, when writing it out for strangers. But, I feel relief. A week ago i was wondering...all sorts of things. Could i go on without meds (uh, no, not if i can help it), could i start making enough money online to leave my boyfriend (sure, after meds kicked in again, but then his ways won't upset me), am i hurting my kids by being distant (yes, but not as much as if i were not protecting them).The kitten has been like a reset button. I still feel anxiety, I still get upset quite easily, but i have her as an escape.

865,"Stomach problems, Bowel problems, Problems on Problems. TMI probably, Can anyone relate?","Lately my physical symptoms have been of a digestive nature. A pretty fun and exciting mix of both stomach, and bowel symptoms! I was joking about the fun and exciting part, they are neither. I'm going to list my symptoms and I want to see if anyone has similar symptoms that they can attribute to IBS and GERD/Acid reflux. 


**Stomach Symptoms**

*Burping,
*Regurgitation,
*Acid coming into mouth sometimes
*Getting full easily
*Lack of appetite, hunger doesn't feel the same.
*Sometimes nausea
*Tickle in throat/coughing which I think may be due to acid.
*No heartburn...

**Bowel Symptoms**

*Constipation,
*Sticky stool - this is gross but lots of wiping, takes FOREVER to get clean,
*Small bowel movements, 
*Flat stools,
*Skinny stools,
*Straining,
*Feeling of fullness and discomfort.


These are pretty much what i've been dealing with on a daily basis, I unfortunately am a slave to the wait times of the Canadian health care system, so I can't see a GI for another month or two, I'm on a waiting list. I'm worried there is either something fatally wrong with me, or something incurable, like Gastroparesis. 

Or this is all just another way of my anxiety issues expressing themselves. Everyday is a struggle with these symptoms, I'm losing weight cause I'm not eating right and that scares me. I'm already a pretty skinny guy, so I need the weight i have. Just wondering if anyone can relate.

868,what has helped me with anxiety,"I just want to give some of my strategies/tips/techniques that have helped me in this journey. About me: Im 26. Ive had GAD/SAD/Mild Sadness (not depression) for about 7 years now. These past years i hid from the world and anxiety had a hold of me. Im much better now. Not 100 percent but better than before. Anyway heres what i do/did. 

1. Read ""at last a life"" by paul david and ""pass through panic"" by claire weekes they both helped tremendously 

2. Practicing mindfulness. Its still new to me and very hard but i can see the benefits of using it 

3. Exercise. Do what you love. I tried running but it wasnt my thing. I like hiking, cycling, and soccer. 

4. GET OUT OF YOUR HOUSE. I know its fucking hard sometimes but you have to do it. Even if its just in front of your house. 

5. No more spending all day in front of my computer or video games. I read, draw, sit in my stairs outside, go for walks etc. 

6. most importantly to me is adopting an IDGAF attitude towards anxiety. That means not giving AF about panic attacks, twitching, heart racing, palpitations, pain here, pain there etc. Just accept everything and anything (the books i recommend explain it all) 

7. Just talk to someone. Im a broke ass so i cant afford a therapist but i talk to my mom who understands me. Just talk to anyone you trust. Let it out and cry if you have to. It helps.

I hope this helps you guys in some way. Like i said i still get bad anxiety but im working on it. I still have to work on my sleep. I slee like 3-4 hours a day. I eat crap food all the time. Im lazy lol. i create unnecessary stress for myself.
I appreciate any feedback or tips from anyone. Thanks :)",15,2014-07-08 00:50:28 EDT-0400
869,[Relaxing] I think I've found my release :),"I have lived my life in constant fear and stress.  It feels like my mind has to be worrying about something of I feel like something is wrong.  As soon as I take care of one fear another steps in and takes its place.

Over the past few months I have been wanting to make a life change and start living my life on my own terms.  I want to overcome the obstacles that are holding me back and be who I truly want to be.

I have found **blogging/writing**.  When I sit down on my computer I am able to write down exactly what I am thinking and feeling.  I am able to reflect on past situations and see where I went wrong or what I could have done differently.

I am able to **acknowledge** my fears.  It has allowed me to be true to myself and realize that I do have a problem, but it is something that can be worked on.

While writing I can sit back and **analyze** the situations.  What I was fearful of, why it makes me nervous, what's the worst that can happen.  All these questions are hard to think about let alone answer when you are having a panic attack or just trembling with fear.

It allows me to **reflect**.  I can try to figure out where I went wrong, or whether the fear was warranted or not.  It allows me to learn from these situations and think of ways I could react differently next time.

I can **share** my feelings a lot easier.  Being a man with anxiety, I often feel embarrassed and ashamed about how I react to certain things and what makes me nervous.  For me it's hard to share with spoken words, but it's so much easier when I write it down.  For some reason I feel less-judged and I'm a lot more comfortable.

My blog provides me with **accountability**.  Before I was not sharing or confiding in anyone, so when I set goals for myself no one was there to hold me accountable.  I would give in when it was hard and then think of myself as a failure.  This would repeat into a vicious cycle and I got to the point where I just gave up.

I can give and receive **inspiration**.  With open comments on my blog and through email I am receiving and I think I'm also giving inspiration.  It makes me feel good when I can help someone who is going through the same things that I go through.

**Motivation** and **Encouragement**.  The internet can be a cruel place, but I have received all positive feedback.  People encourage me to keep going, people motivate me to chase the goal that I am after.

I would highly encourage you to start a blog, or at least write a journal.  Your blog does not have to be public.  It can only be for you to see if that's what you want.

It has helped me a great deal and I think it can help you as well.",13,2014-07-11 22:18:56 EDT-0400

872,I [19 M] make myself feel guilty over things I know are stupid.,"I always end up feeling guilty about things that happened either a year ago or longer and it kills me. I know that I feel guilt over silly, stupid things that nobody else would feel guilty about. I just finished crying because I just want to 'be' once again. I can't take it anymore. 

I'll give a few examples. The current thing that I have convinced myself to feel guilty about is from a year ago. I was chatting online with some people that I had known for about a week. We were having a deep conversation about the afterlife, as far as I can remember. They were talking about Heaven, Hell, etc. I said that I did not fear death (aka the afterlife) because I feel that there is nothing to fear about life after death (again my memory of this conversation is a bit cloudy, so I'm not sure how I worded it). The conversation carried on and later in the conversation 2 of the people in the conversation revealed that they were once suicidal, which made me uncomfortable. My memory is not very clear, but I believe I may have told them that ""life is precious"" in an effort to allow them to turn around their views on life. But, a year later this weird memory randomly pops into my head and I have convinced myself that saying ""I don't fear death"" has influenced them to be suicidal. I am well aware that I cannot control somebody's past. I think something one of the them said that stands out which disturbs me to no end was when she said ""I will probably over dose on pills when I'm 40 or something"".

Another example of something that caused guilt, was this EXTREMELY random event that happened when I was 12. My female friend and I exchanged AIM passwords. I got on her's because I was bored and her bf/my friend was online too, he started chatting with me and I got nervous because my 12 year old mind thought he would think I'm 'gay' to be on his gf's profile. So... out of the blue I just said ""Bye i luv u"" and he said ""luv u 2"". Then I logged off. That was it. AND I FELT GUILTY AT THE AGE OF 19 BECAUSE OF IT. It's funny though, it's an awkward adolescence story. I'm over it now, but why did it bother me so much?

Reddit, I just want this to stop. I'm so sick and tired of fooling myself into thinking that I am an antagonist when I'm really just trying to live my life.

EDIT: Thank you all so much, I knew that I was being stupid the entire time.",18,2014-07-14 08:44:54 EDT-0400

875,How anxiety feels to me.,"Anxiety is - constantly questioning yourself.

Anxiety is - thinking, no, knowing that there is something fundamentally wrong with you. 

Anxiety is - knowing that somewhere along the line, your mind had been corrupted and sent into an unrecoverable spiral that has led you into this unique headspace in which you now reside. 

Anxiety is - knowing that there is no return from your current circumstance.

Anxiety is - wondering how it all seems to come so easily to some people; how the words that escape their lips were summoned so easily from their minds. Anxiety is remembering a time when words seemed to flow from you in this way.

Anxiety is - feeling that each day, you are more awkward and clumsy than the last. That the cleverness and profundity of days past are now but fleeting memories.

Anxiety is - thinking that you are a walking fraud - that nothing you do is as original or as essentially real as what anyone else is doing.

Anxiety is - giving into all of these feelings, trying to forget them, and then worry whether you are doing the right thing.

Anxiety is - realizing the absurdity of all of these self reflective thoughts, feeling helpless, and not knowing what to do with yourself and your mind.



Anxiety is - creating a maze within your own mind and then forgetting the way out.",42,2014-05-27 05:24:11 EDT-0400

879,[Relaxing] Imagine your feelings as weather patterns.,"Whenever I am feeling rather unstable upstairs, it helps me to imagine what I am feeling as different patterns of weather. Ranging from clouds, to full blown hurricanes, to gentle sunlight. 

For instance, a lot of the times when I'm feeling anxious in particular, I imagine my mind as a rain cloud. The rain cloud gets heavier and thicker, the winds pick up and there are a few bolts of lightning. Eventually (3 seconds in reality) the rain storm turns into a thunderstorm. Here we see heavy rain, strong winds, and frequent bolts of lightning appear as anxious thoughts stack exponentially. Things are getting kind of intense, my own thoughts have blasted me out the top of my head in a triangular spiral. That's when I remember a little tool I learned while meditating. 

All storms have to end sooner or later. By imagining the storm dissolving away right before my eyes, the rain stopping, winds coming to a dead halt, and clouds vanishing into nothing, I can finally imagine the sunlight. 

By imagining our feelings as weather patterns, we can correlate happiness to sunlight, anxiety to intense thunderstorms, and depression to dark gloomy overcast. By doing so we can begin to imagine the clouds, which are obscuring our view of happiness, vanish into thin air - thus allowing a clear view of the sun, or happiness in this matter.

Just remember guys and gals: behind the darkest of clouds, the sun still shines.

880,This anxious bitch is running the NYC marathon this year,"I have suffered with our affliction for 14 years. It has held me back from a lot of things... But I have felt much better since I started exercising.  What started as a walk to the end of the street turned into a 5k run, then a 10k and lastly a half marathon in March. I won the lottery for the NYC marathon this year and you better believe I will run that fucker and I will finish (anxiety and all!)

I still have panic attacks. They are a weekly occurrence. But what I am learning is that I can have a panic attack and that they don't have to destroy my day or wreck my goals for the future. Life seems very scary sometimes, because it can be. Life is strange. I am learning to cope with that through talk therapy and exercise and it is helping. The idea of running a marathon is ultra scary to me, but I'm running one. This is real. I am running the New York City Marathon this year.

886,"Has anyone experienced? ""brain zaps""? Usually a symptom of SSRI (drugs like prozac) discontinuation. I have this unusual symptom without drugs and it is voluntary.","I do not have depression or anxiety, I have never taken any medication other than antibiotics though I may have some of the symptoms of ADHD. I realize this is only marginally related to anxiety but any information might help me get to the bottom of this.

From an early age I have been able to voluntarily cause an electrical shock sensation in my head, I told my parents but they didn't believe me and it turned into something I just kept to myself and didn't talk about. Though recently I heard that some people on anti-depressant medication experience a similar symptom.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SSRI_discontinuation_syndrome#Neurological

> Symptoms described as ""brain zaps,"" ""brain shocks,"" ""brain shivers,"" ""brain pulse-waves,"" ""head shocks,"" ""pulses,"" ""flickers,"" or ""cranial zings"" are common withdrawal symptoms

> Electric shock sensations have also been reported[24][25] with many patients describing the symptoms as ""brain zaps"". It has been suggested the sensations may represent an alteration of neuronal activity in the central nervous system.

This is roughly where I experience the electrical sensation.

http://i.imgur.com/SrfmQ2G.png

It is underneath the skull and I can make it last a second, it wears down after a few shocks, I very rarely bother doing this, though I did it just now in order to make that picture. Very occasionally I can feel a shock coming on its own and it is stronger than the others, I can suppress it at will as well.

Has anyone ever had a similar experience? I am by no means an expert so I'm not jumping to conclusions, I think it may be related to a low amount of serotonin receptors which may also be related to ADHD.",94,2014-05-28 22:04:49 EDT-0400

I feel like shit. I can't believe I did that.

888,Just called 911 thinking I had a heart attack...anxiety why you so bad?,"Hiyo reddit,

I am a significantly overweight 23 year old (about 100 lb) and I have been hardcore dieting (<1500 calorie diet daily) and walking 4+miles a day for a while now to get in shape and be healthy.

This morning I woke up with a minor pain in my back and numbness in my arm (thinking now I probably slept on it wrong). Knowing the symptoms of a heart attack I googled other known signs and instantly my body started to recreate those signs. As such I immediately called 911 who came out in about 10 mins with a blood oxygen test and a heart rate monitor.

Blood oxygen fine

Blood pressure 190/101

The blood pressure was likely caused by my stress/panicing so they said I was largely fine, as such they left without taking me to the hospital (thought they said I could if I really wanted to but it was probably unneeded).

This scared the crap out of me, I know losing weight is key but is there anything else that can be done to lower stress? I have always been a nervous wreck and I am in a high stress field (engineering school) so stress is part of life.

*Update*

Hi everybody, thanks for the kind words. Im not usually very emotional (save for anxiety related nerves) but you guys really touched me. I haven't bawled my eyes out to my mother like that in years and it just felt good to know that I am not an oddity. 

My life has been pretty weird, I'm more or less 1 year off being addicted to the internet and online gaming (or as I like to think I was too childish to grow up) In the past year I have moved from CT to WV to attend College at West Virginia University and get my life on track. Im an engineering student who is trying to make dean's list every semester and its put a ton of pressure on me to succeed to show my parents that I am worth a damn. Stress and anxiety have been building up on me for a while now and this maybe was just that reaching a head. 

I will take the advice that several of you have given and try out a yoga studio or just some counseling with a psychologist. Im not against medication for it, but I generally try to use that as a last restort.",28,2014-05-25 18:54:38 EDT-0400

893,"There is hope. I got stuck in an elevator today, and everything ended up just fine.","I am new to this subreddit, but have been dealing with anxiety off and on most of my life. Honestly, up until last fall, I kinda thought I was ""over it""... but since that time, I have had several bouts of, for lack of a better term, I'll just call them ""breathing challenges"".

These last few weeks have been fine. Almost forgot again that I even have any challenges in this area.

I was seeing a client today in an old building where I have an office space. The building is closed and empty on Sundays, doors locked, etc... My client left. I closed up, and was heading out from the 4th floor. Should have taken the stairs, but out of habit, I stepped into the elevator and pressed the old ""1"" button. The door closed, and then... nothing.

I waited a moment, and still nothing. I pressed a few other buttons, including the ""Open Door"" button. Still nothing. 

There was an alarm button, but I really, really did NOT want to press it. I had images of a loud blaring alarm going off, rattling me even more, and still no one hearing. There was no phone in the elevator... but thankfully, I had my cell phone *and* had a connection. I tried the ""non-emergency"" number for the town I live in, all offices closed. The message said to call 911 ""in an emergency"". I dreaded it, but called.

So this is two first for one day. Never had to call 911 before, nor have I ever been stuck in an elevator. That call went OK - they said they would contact the fire department, which as fate would have it, I knew was just a few blocks away.

Awesome. OK. So ""I'll be out of here in no time"", I thought.

And then it dawned on me. That which I suspect this subreddit will ""get"". I realized that I was living one of my own personal nightmares and *NOT* having an anxiety attack!

Wow. Of course, this very thought did start to make my chest tight, and all of a sudden, I realized - no windows, no air flow... and started to feel rather claustrophobic, but I just put my hands gently on my chest and tried to stay in my body, and focus as much as possible on other things, like what I wanted to do today after I get out, etc... and it all went well.

At some point, the elevator started to move, the door opened, and I felt like I was walking into heaven. It was still the 4th floor, and I was never happier to see the stairs. I walked down to find a building maintenance guy talking with the fire department - they asked if I was OK. I wanted to tell them my story, but knew they didn't really care about all that... so yeah, I said, I am great.

This feels like an accomplishment of sorts. I always told myself I could handle such an event, but was also holding onto some level of fear, I suppose. I wanted to share this, because I want others to know that this is possible.

I had the briefest of moments where I could envision myself having a full on panic attack, and having paramedics pull me out, with me clenching at my chest, and them giving me oxygen or something crazy like that. I was able to let that vision go and give it none of my power. I am very grateful for that.

As cliche as it may sound, I hope this helps someone else know that with time and work, things can get better.

896,I want to go back in time and beat myself up.,"41 days ago exactly I bought some hash and smoked it with some friends, ever since then I've had extreme derealization and panic attacks, I feel like I've ruined my life, like ill always be like this. This doesn't seem like real life, I feel like this is a dream like why am I even posting here, this is just a dream. I also developed severe health anxiety after an event which caused me to think I was having a heart attack and actually went to the ER 7 hours before my final exam at 3 AM. My parents have been supportive as my dad has panic disorder as well and completely understands where I'm coming from. I've developed a fear of death and am always anxious that I will have Sudden Cardiac Arrest and die. I've always been scared of death but I was able to get rid of those thoughts when I had them earlier, however ever since I developed health anxiety I've literally been expecting death. Like I would stand infront of my parents room while they slept so incase I had Sudden Cardiac Arrest they would hear me and would be able to take me to the hospital.(I know these thoughts and my actions are ridiculous , however I cant help myself). I'm scared I might have a heart disorder which will kill me, the only time I ever feel normal is when I play video games. I've always played video games, specifically Dota2, however as soon as I leave my PC , I feel dethatched, scared, and just really anxious. I haven't had a panic attack in over 20 days but I'm sure they will return with a vengeance as I have never been this anxious since the day of the Hash. 

I also have the flu at the moment, and I'm actually scared to take my medicine as I'm scared I will have some allergic reaction or whatever. Its really crazy however sometimes I think to myself ""Why am I even stressing? I'm normal , everything is normal, just calm down."" but mere seconds later I'm trembling with anxiety, I'm scared to sleep and die in my sleep, its literally getting this bad, I don't know what to do, I'm not excited for things I would normally be really excited for such as summer vacation, which I have started 3 days ago. I'm just lying in bed all day or playing computer games, I want to feel normal, I want to enjoy life like I did before, I don't want this to get worse , I really don't. Lastly every time I read about someone's else's anxiety I start to develop their symptoms which further affects my de-realization.

897,DAE have extreme job-related anxiety? [pretty much just a rant],"I have anxiety over a fair amount of things, but the worst is when I have to job-hunt. I'm in law school and I have a job lined up (it's a summer internship for now, but it may turn into a full-time offer), but it's not in the same state as my (pretty serious) boyfriend. 

Job hunting the first time around was ridiculously anxiety-inducing, and I was crying and depressed basically every single day. 

Now I have to do it again, and I can feel it starting in my chest and stomach in particular. It's like acid is seeping into my stomach. I need to be focusing on job stuff but it feels so damn pointless because ultimately I will be a professional failure. 

I feel like the anxiety is really preventing me from being fully confident and productive, which are, of course, the things required for me to get a job. 

But there's this huge fear that even if I am confident and productive, the failure will just be too much to handle. At least now I can blame it on anxiety, but if I somehow combat that, and try to my fullest, how can I handle the failure?

908,I'm discovering that I turn anxiety into anger. Anyone else with this issue?,"I've had garden variety generalized anxiety my whole life, with a couple of specific phobias thrown in. This kind of thing has never happened to me before, and I'm trying to understand what is going on. 

Whenever I'm anxious, but there's a chance to blame my husband for the anxiety-provoking situation, I direct my anxiety toward him in the form of anger. For example, we were going on a road trip through the mountains, and two days beforehand I learned it was going to be incredibly snowy, and we would need tire chains to get across the mountain passes. I freaked out and started yelling at him for changing our road trip plans to take us through the mountains instead of along the California coast, where it wouldn't be snowy. I had wanted to go through California, and he wanted to go through the mountains so we could go skiing. I had been totally on board with that plan until I learned the weather was going to be bad. 

Another example: I get anxious about his relationship with a female friend, even though there is rationally nothing at all to be threatened by (she's in a happy marriage, and so are we.). But I get mad at him constantly over the content of their conversations, even though he isn't doing anything I didn't already told him it is okay to do (all he does is text her). It's incredibly irrational (you have to just trust me that he hasn't done *anything* to betray my trust or cause me to be worried). But instead of just being anxious, because that's all I really feel, I get very angry at him, and say really terrible accusatory things. When I look back on it, I feel very terribly guilty for being angry, when I really was just anxious. 

Is this a common thing? How do people deal with it? I DO NOT want to go back to avoiding the things I'm afraid of. I don't want to be the kind of person who restricts her husband's other relationships out of fear. But it hurts him for me to be mad at him all the time, and I have to stop it, but I don't know how, since, once I calm down, I realize that I'm not mad at him, I'm just anxious.

Is it just me or does anyone else feel a bit bothered whenever someone tries to say they have an anxiety disorder because ""they get a little bit nervous?""

I can totally understand being a little bit nervous or having butterflies in your stomach... That's actually pretty normal for a lot of people... But, that doesn't mean you have an actual anxiety disorder.

Having an anxiety disorder is not just being ""a little bit nervous."" Having an anxiety disorder is being so damned nervous that you start manifesting ticks, tremors, shaking, stuttering or other obsessive behaviour. 

Having an anxiety disorder is not ""butterflies in your stomach."" Having an anxiety disorder is ""A giant, rabid and angry honey-badger in your stomach.""

Having an anxiety disorder is not ""Whoops, I forgot to give this cute person my number. I'm such a dummy."" Having an anxiety disorder is ""You stupid fucking moron, you should never have gone out to socialize at all because you can't even get this one simple social thing right by giving that cute person your number.""

It does not make you ""Cute"" or ""Quirky"" to be all ""lol, I'm a little bit anxious because I have an anxiety disorder."" In fact, it's kinda insulting because you are trying to use it to make yourself feel special and by doing so you are minimizing and dismissing what those of us that have it face on a daily basis.

913,Failed twice in two weeks [Rant],"Last friday night I went out with two other friends to a club. We drank a couple of beers, we had a table to ourselves. Everything was going great, until somebody had the idea to change clubs.

We all agreed and went to this other place, which was packed. It was like being forced to go into a swimming pool full of people. I went in there and before I knew it, all my friends were just ... gone. I was alone. With everybody else. Staring at me, watching me, dancing around me. I couldn't breathe. People were all turning to watch me panic, watch me bleed on the inside. I felt like in the ""Invasion of the Body Snatchers"", except that I wished somebody could just turn me into one of them, and be rid of this fucking feeling of dread, of fearing all my actions.

I turned around and I went home. I didn' tell anyone. I just went home and got into my apartment, in my bed, under my sheets, nobody to fear. It was all OK again... until a few hours ago.

Same thing as last week. Went to the same club with two of friends, had a few beers, had a table to ourselves. All OK. The guy with last week's idea to change clubs was not there. I felt safe again. But there was this other guy with us who liked to talk to random women, which I could never understand. He noticed two of them sitting down to the table right next to us. He went in for the kill.

> Could we join your table?

> Sure!

They joined. They both looked at me and told me to follow suit.

The music was loud. I was sitting between them. They were both busy talking to them, they were pretty responsive, but not really (in my opinion). I was sipping my beer like it was water in the desert. I was the third wheel. I wanted out. I wanted to run again. My friend to my right goes to the bathroom. My friend to my left is deep in conversation with one of the girls. She's smiling. I'm not. I look at the girl on right my other friend left behind. She doesn't even notice me. She's checking her phone every 5 seconds. I notice that her hand is in a cast:

> What happened?

> Gym accident.

> How did you manage that?

> I have no idea.

> How come?

> It just happened

Really? You have no idea? I broke my arm when I was 6 and I still remember every detail. I remember the pain, I remember the worry, my parents' reaction.

I told her about my cast.

> ... Except mine wasn't all signed like yours.

Hers was signed. All over. She smiled and checked her phone again, her smile fading as soon as her eyes touched the screen. My friend comes back. Their conversation continues. I'm alone again. I just had  conversation with a stranger for the first time in years.

Not a great one, but a conversation nonetheless. I tell my friend I'm hungry, and that I'll be right back. I grab my jacket and fly out of there, I go home. I never went back. Now I'm in my bed again, under my sheets and I don't think I can take another failure, another disapointment, another person with a fully signed cast checking their phone and ignoring me just because they don't care ... And why should she care? She didn't ask to sit with me. She doesn't have to do anything, really. She has her choice and she does as she pleases. And that goes for every woman out there. We're just clowns putting on a show and the funniest clown wins. That's how it feels, anyway.

Sorry for the long rant, but this will probably help me sleep better tonight.

916,What do you personally find to be the best immediate methods for alleviating anxiety? (Plus a few of my own solutions),"As someone who has suffered from severe anxiety in one form or another on a daily basis ever since I hit puberty, I’m curious to know what other anxiety-sufferers do when they’re feeling especially anxious and want to try to calm down and relax ASAP.  The obvious answer is immediate-acting anti-anxiety meds (benzodiazepines) such as Klonopin, Xanax etc but I’ve found I still have problems with anxiety even after taking the benzo I’m prescribed (Klonopin), even if it does somewhat diminish my anxiety and take the edge off of things.  The second obvious answer is alcohol but personally I’ve found that about 20% of the time it makes things marginally better and the other 80% of the time it makes my anxiety and general sanity/emotional well-being *significantly* worse; this has all been whilst drinking alone though...social drinking is an entirely different animal which I’ve found has a much higher success rate the few times I’ve done it.

So what are some other methods or techniques you guys find useful for instant anxiety relief?  I’m not looking for long-term solutions like therapy, SSRIs, or other things that typically take weeks or months to see benefits from, as I’ve tried many of these already with mixed results and am really just looking for ideas to alleviate or lessen anxiety right away while it’s actually happening.
So far some of my solutions are ASMR videos, such as these:

#1: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RVpfHgC3ye0
#2: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6UrUsduW4FA
#3: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2g9e2ner9sE
#4: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv4BOmjRids

*(Also head over to /r/asmr for many more videos like this)*

Also, particularly soothing music seems to help as well – [this track](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CySNhHVAokQ) in particular is [claimed by scientists to be the “most relaxing song ever”](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/8830066/Band-creates-the-most-relaxing-tune-ever.html) and, according to [the Wikipedia article](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marconi_Union#Weightless), “it induced a 65% reduction in overall anxiety and brought test subjects' resting pulse rates to 35% of their usual resting rates.""

Two albums also come to mind; [“Dive” by Tycho](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dive_%28Tycho_album%29) and [“Black Sands” by Bonobo](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_sands).

After playing these videos and songs on a daily basis for years I’ve found I’ve become rather desensitized to them unfortunately, but they do still help a little (and hopefully will better help others out there just discovering them for the first time).  

In addition, I find lighting candles, turning the heat up, and drinking certain kinds of tea to also help somewhat.  Oh, and scalp massagers, too…for those of you who don’t know, it’s [these things](http://i.imgur.com/RBOv9db.jpg).

So those are a few of my semi-solutions, but I’m very interested in hearing from the rest of you.  Be they songs or albums that relax you, massage or relaxation tools/devices, types of tea, or any other thing, technique, product or method that reduces or alleviates your anxiety right away...what’s worked the best for you?",40,2014-02-09 03:57:02 EST-0500

924,Just woke up with the worst anxiety attack of my life. Almost called an ambulance. Terrified and debating checking into a hospital today. Home alone and need to talk to someone.,"Hello guys,

Ugh. I'm terrified even writing this. I don't know what happened today at all.

I'm going to keep this relatively short. I'm a little scared by how calmly I'm typing - I'm afraid I'm not getting across how scared I am. I'm semi in shock.

Shortish backstory - I'm 29, and have had severe panic disorder, depression, and ocd since I was eight. Been suicidal since sixteen. Also been sexually/emotionally abused, so having issues with that. I was in therapy for awhile, great therapy, and it helped so much. But my parents lost their insurance so I had to stop early. Extremely broke myself now, so I've been dealing on my own and trying free groups when I can (although I haven't in awhile - moved to an area away from the groups I was going to).

Okay. Some relevant things about my panic, before I explain tonight. (Still worried it's not panic and something is extremely wrong with me.) I have ocd with health phobias (which my old therapist said was different from hypochondria). I get absolutely petrified when I'm sick. I'm especially scared of fainting, seizures, fevers, heart attacks, etc. I woke with a fever of 104 when I was eight, and have a massive fear of waking with a fever because of that. Also, my body temp fluctuates a lot, and lately I've been very fixated on taking my temp to calm myself and make sure I'm not sick. My temp tends to run low - around 97.6-98.1. During panic, it's gone down around to 95.4, or up to 100. Drives me crazy. I also get extremely weak in my panic, very dizzy, very faint (never actually fainted though), massive depersonlization, etc. Also tends to get triggered by pms and my period - I have low blood pressure, so doesn't help. Been having bad insomnia lately, too.

Ugh, this is long. I'm sorry, guys :( I'm just so out of it right now.

So I've had a tough few weeks, but was feeling relatively okay today. I had had to work while really sick with pms last night until around one am. Had to work today from ten am until around ten pm. I only slept from around four thirty to nine thirty last night. So I was tired. I ate a little more than normal (tend to avoid eating). Was kinda dizzy tonight, but thought I was mainly tired. My boyfriend came over for a bit, and we watched tv and relaxed. When he left, I ate some chocolate, realized I had just started my period and was happy because I was barely cramping, read a bit, and feel asleep around 3:15. 

It's cold out, and stuff in my apartment, but I have a fan going. I was sleeping in just a t shirt, and under a few blankets. Was comfy. I had taken my temp before bed (I know I shouldn't so often :( ) and I was back down to 97.7 after being high for about a week due to pms (like I get every month - it normally goes back to normal soon after starting my period). I thought I felt calmer.

Then around four, I woke up. I noticed I sweating on my neck. I seldom sweat. I was a bit confused but didn't think it was a huge deal. Soon I noticed I sweating everywhere -kinda soaked, for me at least. (I dunno if I was sweating that much at first, or if I got nervous when I noticed the sweat and then started sweating...) I tried to just go back to sleep...Kicked off one blanket (leaving a light blanket and as sheet on). I kept noticing how much sweat was on me. I started to freak out, thinking I woke up with a fever.

I don't even remember clearly how the next steps went. I got up to go to the bathroom and try to calm down. I was so dizzy when I stood up - I felt like I was falling, like everything was fuzzy. I felt incredibly weak and so hot and just hysterical. I started sobbing and half screaming - I do that a lot with panic. These all are semi normal for me with panic - they just felt more intense (which I honestly didn't think was possible), and more, real, I guess? I was convinced I had a fever of like 105 and was dying. I was losing my mind.

I typically, during panic, will sit on my bathroom floor and read or use my laptop, because the cool tile calms me and I can throw up if I have to, etc. I tried that. I just couldn't focus. I wanted to take my temp but got terrified it would be high. That made everything worse - I kept wandering my tiny apartment, freaking out and worrying I was going to fall. I got so scared I would pass out or get too weak that I ended up just crawling on my floor trying to distract myself, and crying and praying.

I thought about hurting myself, but didn't. I got semi happy because I realized I wanna live, so that's something, I guess.

I thought I was going to throw up, but didn't. This all went on for like fifteen minutes. I grabbed my phone and almost called my boyfriend, almost called an ambulance, tried to figure out who lives closest to me (I have no car, and live in a basement studio apartment in an old couple's house that i don't really associate with). 

I ended up passing a little gas, which made me feel a bit better. That often helps with my panic, so I started thinking maybe that's what was happening. (Before this, I was utterly, UTTERLY convinced it was medical. I usually worry it is, but this felt far more certain to me.) That convinced me to try to take my temp. I was mortified - I have a few cheap digital thermometers - some older than others. They're not that accurate - one is always giving me a reading of around .5 higher htan the other. Odd. Anyway, I used them both. I came up like 96.0 and 96.6. I felt a bit calmer, but worried I was going into hypothermia or something. I felt incredibly hot to the touch to me, but my hands tend to get extremely cold.

I tried to get up and walk again, and still felt super weak. Finally, I ended up able to get my laptop and focus a bit on reading. I was looking up nighttime panic attacks. I've never woken up with one before - I started thinking that's what was happening.

Is it possible that a panic attack is worse or seems more real when you wake up with it? That I was half asleep and not thinking clearly? Could I have just gotten a hot flash or something while sleeping, or panicked while sleeping (which has made my temp rise before - panic, just not during sleep that I know of, although I rarely get a bit sweaty while sleeping)? Is it not likely medical?

I'm debating going to a clinic today to see a doctor to just try to get a referally to a cheap therapist or something. I'm currently petrified of sleeping, or of living alone (which I was already scared of). I'm also so so so so so so scared that it's not panic and something is wrong, and that I need an ambulance. Ugh. Although I guess I wouldn't be doing better? After the temp reading, I started shaking and having more of my usual panic symptoms. I'm calm enough now that I'm back in bed, under my blankets. I feel freezing but my face feels warm to my touch. My temp seems to be back around like 98.0, which would be better. I'm guessing that wouldn't improve if I were really sick?

I'm so tired, and now I'm scared to even sleep :( My boyfriend comes back around nine this morning, so about two and half hours from now. Debating staying up until he gets here, skipping work, going to a clinic or something. I'm scared to, though. I'm afraid I need to go to a hospital for my panic or something, that I'm not able to live on my own right now.

I just don't even know what's wrong with me. I hate being this way. So much. I'm so tired. I don't want to do this anymore at all :(

Thanks so much for any help. 

EDIT: wow, you guys, I can't think you enough. I ended up sleeping for around two hours, and my bf came over and made me drink some Gatorade and relax. Texted my best friend who was a psychology major, and she's positive it's panic and I'm okay. 

She asked me to come over today, so I've been hanging out at her apartment and she's gonna have me sleep here tonight, since I'm really scared about sleeping alone in case it happens again. Been shaky and scared all day, but started to calm down. 

She's also helping em try to sign up for Obama care, and she's going to help me find some therapy I can afford here. Apparently all my friend could tell my anxiety has been getting worse so they were of expecting.

I can't thank you guys enough. Kindness from strangers is overwhelming. I always feel so weak and babyish when I'm scared of his stuff. I was just so convinced I was dying...ugh. You guys have made this day so much better :)",22,2014-02-10 14:23:35 EST-0500

Honestly, knowing that I'm not alone and that some of you also have these same exact issue with cleaning helps me feel less insane. I am not lazy. That factor turned out to be huge. So thank you all. Seriously. Some may disagree but today I accomplished something that I couldn't see myself doing yesterday. I'm fighting back against my anxiety and depression and today I won.

938,Terrible anxiety about loved ones dying/something bad happening to them,"My anxiety had seemed to be getting better in the last couple of months, though I'm still under a large amount of stress. However, as of the past week or so I've been getting awful anxiety and obsessive thoughts about someone I love dying or any number of bad things happening to them, mostly my boyfriend. I'm afraid every time he leaves for work or to come home he'll get in a car accident (this is my main fear) or I just visualize every awful scenario I can think of.

I end up obsessing over what would happen and how horrifying it would be to lose him, how I'd go on, what would I do, how alone I'd be... It's an all around shitty feeling, and then I keep thinking that since I have such a terrible feeling about it that my gut is telling me something is going to happen any day now, like I'm predicting it (I know, I'm stupid)

I don't want to fall back into some long stint of obsessive thoughts, and these are particularly stressful and disturbing to me. I suppose finally letting it out well help, does anyone else deal with thoughts of death like this?",16,2014-08-20 09:57:29 EDT-0400
939,Just had the worst panic attack of my life,"Things have been excruciatingly bad lately but...I was in the car as a passenger with my mom and I have very strong driving/car phobia...we were at a traffic light and a truck went to make a turn and took it way too late...my mom kept backing up but the truck was coming straight towards us...I was sure that we were going to get crushed by the truck and I was hyperventilating and screaming

Right before my mom swerved out of the way I jumped out of the car (at a traffic light, mind you) and ran onto the sidewalk. It was absolute fight or flight and I ended up on the sidewalk unable to breathe. I literally thought I was dying that very moment of a major heart attack. 

My mom swerved out of the way but the truck did really mess up. All of the cars at the intersection had to back up very far and it was a mess, so my mom pulled around to pick me up and tried to help calm me down. 

Now I'm worried that whoever was behind us called the cops and that they're going to arrest me for running away at a traffic light and freaking out. I feel so fucking crazy right now. I'd never done anything like that but my life has been so horrible lately and my anxiety is the worst it has ever been. I have no friends right now or anything and my mom herself is clinically depressed so she just brings me down and she can't help it. I'm on a huge waiting list for a therapist and tomorrow I'm going to call my doctor and try to get an appointment so he can put me on some meds but that's all I can do and all I want to do is talk to someone but I have no one I can talk to. I've been having breathing troubles and severe symptoms and misophonia and enormous irrational panic attacks and I've never been this bad before but recently I've had a death of someone very close to me and a lot of other things involving a man who severly abused me who is now back in my life by no choice of my own and there's so much going on and I need help I feel like I'm dying right now and I don't want to die I want to live and be happy someone please help me someone talk to me please I need someone to talk to so badly right now",7,2014-08-18 03:43:44 EDT-0400

944,[Update] Let's see if Panic Pop works + news about other games for anxiety,"*This is the OP delivering [on this post.](http://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/2ddhp4/i_made_an_android_game_to_stop_panic_attacks_want/)*

First, I would like to thank you /r/anxiety. You guy's have downloaded [Panic Pop](https://play.google.com/apps/publish/?dev_acc=13173502598993103496#AppListPlace) over 1000+ times in the first two days. That's pretty incredible. 

I would like to run a [little survey](https://www.surveymonkey.com/s/ZB8VZCD) to see how the game has helped people. If you have had a panic attack and used Panic Pop to treat it, please take it. It's two questions, won't take you more than a minute.

I'd rather not clutter up /r/anxiety with further updates about Panic Pop, so I think I'm going to be like every other game developer on the planet and [use twitter](https://twitter.com/flaqueEau). If you would like updates, I encourage you to follow there. You also can keep an eye out on [my personal website](http://codeisscary.com/). 

**If you would like to help Panic Pop** grow and be able to help more people, [this could really use your support](https://www.thunderclap.it/projects/15209-stop-panic-attacks-with-games?locale=en).

I would like to talk to you guy's about **another game** that I found out about a little while ago. [Flowy](https://flowygame.com/) is a mobile game that's coming out this fall. The game uses Breathing Retraining Exercises to help the user calm themselves during a panic attack. It's being backed by a lot of much more knowledgeable than myself. If you find that Panic Pop really just isn't your thing or maybe it's not working for you, I would seriously encourage you to check out Flowy. 

Finally, I would like to make an important announcement about Panic Pop. It's important to understand that Panic Pop is a temporary solution. The best method by far is prevention. If you are having panic attacks consistently, seek a therapist. Other solutions like /r/Meditation and regular exercise can help tremendously. Most importantly, options like exposure therapy and cognitive behavioral therapy can be your ticket to recovery.

945,"Anyone else hear loud ""bangs"" that wake them up?","Idk if this is my anxiety, but often I'll be just about to fall asleep when I hear a loud bang, or I feel someone punching me, hitting me, or shooting me and it wakes me up. Sometimes even in the middle of the night. It's happened up to twenty times in a night (all just as I was falling asleep).

Does anyone else have this happen? I'm trying to figure out why it's happening.

946,"[Rant] Since when is it okay to make people feel bad for worrying about ""simple"" things?","I get really paranoid when something happens in a video game that doesn't seem right. I recently posted to r/tomodachilife asking if something my game did was a glitch. I got an answer (thankfully nothing was wrong) and I was pretty happy...

But then two people felt they needed to tell me that I'm overreacting, as if they wanted to make me feel bad for worrying; one of them looked through my stuff for older posts where I'd asked if something was wrong with one of my Pokemon games just to tell me again that I'm too worried... on two different posts! Then that same person even sent me a message mocking how worried I was.

Seriously?! Everyone reacts differently to things. Is it so much to ask that when someone sees that a stranger is worried about something they don't judge them for worrying?

I blocked the person who sent me the message and gave the other person a tag (I have RES, so I can put colored tags that only I see by peoples usernames) reserved for people who are mean to me so I know to avoid them.

947,"[Success] Suddenly learning the concept of ""Enjoying things in moderation"" while on meds (slightly NSFW story)","I'm 24/F, and I've been on Citalopram for three weeks now for depression and anxiety.

I used to have a serious addiction problem before I started the meds:

Eating: I'd get hungry at odd times of the day and night and start pacing around while devouring snack foods. My eating schedule was completely screwed up, and I subsisted mostly on junk/tasty foods for over two years because I had such a fear of trying new things and cooking. I'm very surprised that I'm not fat.

Drinking: Every day I had to have at least one 20oz soda. $1.50 a day for something so unhealthy really adds up as an unnecessary expense. I guzzled down so much it gave me horrible heartburn and nausea when I worked at a job with free fountain drinks.

Video games: It wasn't hard for me to get extremely hooked on any game I played, and I'd often stay up until 4-5 in the morning playing games, or at least as late as I possibly could given my schedule. When my anxiety was highest, I didn't even sleep and just played a lot of games when I should have been working on finals/etc.

Sex: Even when I wasn't horny, I'd feel pressured to have sex for no real reason other than that it was interesting and I was bored. I'd go on Craigslist and write out long posts, then chat with people for hours before actually meeting if someone wanted to do it blindly. I lost my virginity on this site to a guy I actually found very unattractive because he was the first who wanted to meet me without me sending a picture of myself. I met a total of 17 guys from that site for various sexual acts with no standards whatsoever, something that I'm very ashamed of, and I couldn't even stay aroused with all but one of them. I dodged a bullet by not getting pregnant or STDs (though I did insist on condoms).

I'm very pleased that my meds have evened me out enough that I now tell myself in the moment that it is time to stop at the right time. I didn't even realize that I was anxious/depressed when I was doing these things. 

And with the sex thing, even a month ago I just saw it as a dirty thing that I hated myself for but something interesting to do nonetheless when I was bored. I see that habit now as something I can very easily leave in my past, and I actually have a voice in my head telling me it is better to be patient with those things and to meet a guy who cares about me.

Just thought I'd share a relevant success story since many other people with anxiety have OCD tendencies. ",12,2014-08-21 17:58:31 EDT-0400
948,13 year old immigrant going literally insane,"13 and male.

I posted the following in Suicide Watch this morning: http://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/2dpqiv/13_year_old_immigrant_going_literally_insane/

I was told in a pm to post here too for advice.

I have delusions before I go to sleep that I am dying of a heart attack or cancer, or that I can't control certain body parts, or that I am going to sleep walk and harm people against my will.

When I can get to sleep, I sometimes violently jolt awake and it starts again.

I am going literally insane, but just at night. I am aware of my rising insanity when it is happening but can't control it. I am just helpless to whatever my mind subconsciouslly wants to force to happen. I feel like every night is my last as a sane/alive person. Everything I fear sounds stupid while I am awake, but I get paranoid delusions at night.

Is this schizophrenia and should I suicide to prevent myself from doing bad things as it gets worse?",18,2014-08-17 03:59:03 EDT-0400
949,I need to get this off my chest.,"I've been struggling with severe Anxiety and Depression since I was about 12, that's when I was diagnosed. That was almost a decade ago. I've taken many different pills, some that have made me numb, others that didn't do jack. 


Currently, I've been having a hard time. I can't get a job, not a single employer has called me back. I've been having a hard time with the changes in my life so my mood swings are going crazy. Because of that, my anxiety is off the charts. 


My fiancé and father don't understand. In their minds, I need to get over it. Just forget I have anxiety and go out and make friends. They think it's just me being lazy and a loner. As if I enjoy hiding out in my house every day. 


I hate being stuck at home. I want to go out and have fun. Some days are easier than others and I can do exactly that, but lately, with my SO working, I just can't. We only have one car so even when I feel like I can handle getting out and having fun, I'm stuck here anyway. I hate myself for not being able to just let it go and be outgoing. I hate that they don't understand. I hate that they get mad at me when I try to explain what it feels like. Most of all, I hate that they think I'm making up excuses so I can just be lazy.


My SO is incredibly outgoing, he LOVES making friends. I do too, it's just harder. I find I'm more outgoing when he's around, but he obviously can't be by me at all times. 



I need to get back into therapy and find the right meds. If I don't, I risk losing a lot of good in my life and I refuse to let this BS mental illness fuck me over more than it already has. I hate letting it control me! I'm so fucking done!

951,Just a reminder of how awesome you really are.,"A lack of mental fortitude. That is what it used to be called. Coward, too sensitive, weak. This is what society used to think of us. What are you really though?

Today, you are a soldier on the front lines of mental illness. You are the day in day out survivor of a psychological war being fought in your own mind. A lack of mental fortitude? Hell no. If anything you have more will and mental strength then nearly everyone you know combined. Coward? Hardly. Courage and will are the weapons you wield everyday as you hold on to the belief that tomorrow will be better. That this 'episode' is only temporary and all you need to do is brave the storm that anxiety hurls at you like the angry trident of Poseidon himself.
This is a new kind of courage. A new kind of bravery. Defined not by bullets and bombs but by mental strength and the ability to look your fear right in the eye every single day.

Go look at yourself right now in the mirror, what do you see? A victim? A patient? Someone to be pitied? I don't. I see a warrior whose tests are silent and hidden. Don't be sad for that state that you find yourself in. Take pride in looking back and seeing what it is you've survived so far. Doctors may tell you not to define your life by your 'condition'. I say to hell with that. Why wouldn't you want the world to see just how strong you are?

954,Do you guys ever get waves where you just feel exhausted?,"In the past few years, I've experienced tons of symptoms that I know are anxiety (panic attacks, chest pain, scalp tension, neck tension, etc). The one thing I don't like dealing with is exhaustion. 

Last year I experienced long exhaustion after obsessive worry following a panic attack. Some days I'd be so drained. The same thing happened a year before, but I was a drinker then, so I attributed it to just drinking a lot. 

This year I felt great until I starting obsessively worrying again after getting strep throat (in June). The exhaustion started to return, but I'm also beginning to realize my stress more often. I'm in my last semester in college, living from check to check...sometimes no checks...handling an editor position at a newspaper, etc. I don't have a normal sleep schedule, really, I use a computer all of the time, and feel like sometimes I can't clear my head. Then I'll just crash...I'll feel like pure shit. Physically, more than mentally. The only time I feel really good is when I go to exercise, or if I'm with my g/f, who kind of just eases my mind. 

I'm beginning to accept, now that I've dealt with this for three years, that these problems are stress related. I have been told how to manage, and have proactively begun to see a counselor again. 

Anyone else get tired easily from being stressed? Any good solutions?

964,"Does you ever know that you're fine, but your body still reacts the way it would to extreme anxiety?","I started a job about a month ago, which was huge for me. It's obviously pretty normal to be nervous when you start a job, but coupled with my anxiety, I was pretty miserable. Still, after a month, every single day before I go into work, I get terrible nausea to the point where I feel like I'm going to vomit. Every. Day. Logically, I know that I'm fine, and the nausea wears off after 20ish minutes. 


Well yesterday was a really bad day. I've been super fragile for the past week or so and I was really feeling it yesterday. I cried before I left for work and I cried on the way to work. I got there, it was fine, whatever. About an hour in I got a customer who was very unhappy and I called my manager and he dealt with it for me, but he could tell that I was still really uncomfortable and not okay, I just told him I was tired and would be fine. Then I had a customer who needed a tax exempt. I'd only done one before so I was still a little shaky on it. I put the form in too soon, so that receipt printed on the form, not on the receipt paper. I called for help, and one of the other managers came and ""helped."" By this time, the nicer male manager had left for the day. This female manager has always been a little rude/cold to me but I was used to it so I figured take a deep breath and get over it. While all the managers were fixing the receipt for her down at the other end, the lady whose thing I screwed up asked if I was new or training, so I said yes. Because I am new and still very uncomfortable. She responded with ""well they're not very helpful. they should be helping you, not leaving you over here all alone."" And I just burst into tears. She felt awful, saying"" ""No! Honey, don't cry,"" which of course made me cry harder. Long story short I got to go on my break early so I could get myself together, but I was still very much not okay.  

The not-so-nice managers were a little more considerate the rest of the day, but now I'm terrified I'm not going to be able to hold it together at all. It doesn't help that I'm going to be working the longest shift I've had so far today. I woke up this morning and felt the nausea immediately. 

I don't really know what to do here. I want to quit, with all of my heart I just don't want to have this job, but it's at a craft store and I live for making things. I can't afford counseling and I'm hoping that once I get a steady income I can go to the doctor and get some medicine or something. It's just terrible. It's bad for my health, mentally and physically(I have the body of an 80 year old woman), but I need money. It's not even 30 hours a week, it's barely 20 hours a week. And I've been wanting to talk to my boss, but this week is inventory and something called ""fall tour"" which is where higher-ups from the company come and ""examine"" our store, so now isn't really a time to ask for anything. 

And this is just one bad circumstance. I swear there's at least one thing I do every day that I can tell pisses someone off, or makes them think I'm stupid and useless, which just makes me feel stupid and useless. I don't want to come home on the brink of tears every night, and I don't want to have to wake up with nausea every morning.

tl;dr: every day before work I get terribly nauseous. Yesterday I had an emotional breakdown at my register and am now worried I won't be able to hold myself together at all. I want to quit, but I need the money.

I'm about to finish college with a useless degree in something I thought I liked,  video games (the degree is multimedia), and as a result I don't know where to apply in university. 

I can't even form correct sentences around people. I can't even express my opinions on even trivial things like a fucking video game. I end up not talking to anyone because I assume I Weill always sound like a fucking idiot, and I always do. I end up becoming the goofy guy of the group. I don't even feel like I've friends. They just hang with me to be polite. 

My schoolworks have also been affected. I forget things constantly, it's hard to process what the teachers are saying and I always have to ask help from people. I end up mostly not doing it because I did it so much that I pretty much think that they are just annoyed by it. I feel like I have to sort it out myself.

I just hope it's not that early-20s phase of confusion and worry that is always parodied in the movies. I don't want to become a laughing stock.

The worst thing is that I do t even have severe anxiety, at least not anymore. I rarely have panick attacks and I can be quite cheerful at times. But I still feel this shame and fear. I even end up thinking that I don't even have anxiety issues and that I'm just probably dumb.

I'm never content with my health, theres always that one thing that bugs me in the back of my mind. 

I get to the point where I feel I can't enjoy good things because whats the point if I'm just going to die from one of these diseases. If something good happens, it makes me feel more sad for this reason. For some reason, I've never felt like I will live for ages and die of old age, I always feel like I will die young and upset my family. This leads me on to my next point which is that when I think about getting these diseases, I don't consider how I would feel just what my mum or dad would say. I picture them crying because their young child was unlucky.

975,Michael Bay's panic attack on-stage at CES and the media's complete lack of respect for anxiety.,"I'm not going to link to the video, we all know what an anxiety/panic attack feels and looks like, but needless to say, one of Hollywood's most well-known names just had a pretty good anxiety attack today while on stage for Samsung's keynote speech at CES.  The media has jumped on it pretty strongly.

When you go to look at the headlines and write-ups….even from more liberal sources (which traditionally are more respectful of stuff like this) like HuffPost, they're calling it a 'meltdown' and a 'self-destruction' and all these words that just further demonize what is a very common condition.  It ticks me off they choose these words to merely drive more traffic to their sites….they don't understand the weight of what they are doing.

But here's what REALLY surprised me…when you look at the comments, you see a very different story.  Normally when you read the 'Comments' section of an online story you walk away feeling helpless for humanity, but not on this.  A good percentage are pointing out what we already know, he had an anxiety attack, that's it.  Many pointed out that the guy deserved empathy and space, not ridicule, and it really stuck out to me how much of the online community echoed this thought.  People out there know and empathize with what we are going thru.

I almost hope Bay would come out as a spokesman for anxiety, though I doubt he ever would.",46,2014-01-07 09:27:33 EST-0500

But I'm determined to get better. Maybe things will just get worse and worse but right now, at this moment, my resolution is recovery.

I'm going to try meditation this year.

I'm going to talk to my school counselor more.

I'm going to watch interviews and learn in-depth about my anxiety no matter how painful it is.

I'm going to find as many positive songs as I can.

When I'm relapsing I will look in the mirror and tell myself that I am beautiful and strong and I will get through it.

I'm going to pick up my grades.

I'm going to exercise.

I'm going to go out of my comfort zone a little.


I'm going to keep my positive recovery blog running this whole year.

I'm going to keep my friends instead of driving them away.

I'm going to go to a party.

I'm going to encourage mental health awareness.

I'm going to inspire people.

I'm going to have anxiety attacks and panic attacks and I will cry and I will break down and I will hide in my room and lock myself away, sometimes, and that is okay.

But I'm going to pick myself back up.

I'm going to keep fighting, even if it takes a year, two years, ten years, or forever.

984,"DAE do this (kind of funny, but seriously sad)","So I was laying around, after a whole day of doing nothing; sitting around (all day), eating junk food, and left over holiday candy.

I was in a great mood, and decided to go take a nice relaxing hot shower. I shaved, messed up my beard, and had to shave the whole thing off- I've had a beard since I could grow one. I looked in the mirror, and laughed at how odd I looked, and mutter to myself 

""great, now this is the day I'll die, and my viewing will be someone nobody recognizes"" 

As I'm relaxing in the shower, I get a pain in my arm. a sharp very distinct pain. I rubbed my fingers over the spot, and noticed the pain was right where a vein is...First thought in my mind is ""BLOODCLOT!!!"" (if that is only one word). I start to get a bit anxious,and then my arm starts getting red, and feels swollen...I'm a goner

The first thing I do as I'm panicking and getting dressed (so I'm not naked if I die), is think of my porn history, my porn collection, and a couple toys I have stashed! 

I rush around the house, still wet, clothes half on, two fingers on my neck checking that I still have a pulse, deleting browser histories, deleting porn files, and gathering the couple male masturbatory sex toys I have, to throw them in the bin outside. 

My neighbors must think I'm insane. Here's comes a guy in fuzzy slippers, jeans, and a bathrobe, carrying a garbage bag that clearly has only 2 or 3 objects in it, with his finger on his pulse, in zero degree weather...then I slipped and fell, flinging my bag into the air. 

As I'm swearing and clearing the snow off of my bathrobe, I realize the bag has broken, and I don't know where my toys went. All I see is white fluffy snow; all they see is a semi naked guy on all fours switching between: throwing snow around, checking his pulse, and looking to see if his arm is anymore swollen, on an ever lasting loop. 

I find the toys and shove them into the bag as quickly as I can, and covering the bag with my robe. I look up and instantly they both found opposite ends of the universe to peer at, as if they had no idea I was even outside. 

I finally run back inside, make sure the computer is clear, and finish getting dressed. By the time I finished everything, I had calmed down a bit, because the pain subsided. But now I sit here half panicked thinking ""the pain is gone, thank baby Jesus...but what if the clot has moved from my arm and is making it's way to my chest!?"", and finding humor in all of this, and giggling to myself.

DAE-panic and instantly resort to getting ready to be found dead, by clearing histories, hiding/throwing away/destroying things you wouldn't want your friends and family to know about; only to realize you just panicked, and you maybe shouldn't have reacted like that?

985,TIL that the average person waits 10 years before seeking help for mental health issues,"A door-to-door fundraiser for a mental health centre knocked on my door this afternoon. I don't usually answer the door if I'm not expecting anyone, but for some reason I did.

One of the things he said in his pitch was that the average person waits 10 years before seeking help for depression or anxiety. That really got to me, because that's me. I've been so afraid of seeking help that I only recently took the first steps of talking about it to someone for the first time. When he said that, I realized I don't want to wait any longer and it helped my resolve to ask my doctor for a counselling referral. 

Anyway, I just thought this stat might let people know they're not alone. If you've decided to seek help, congrats! If you haven't been able to do it yet, I feel you and I'm rooting for you. I also wanted to mention that this sub (though I've mostly been lurking) has been a huge help in encouraging me to do something about my anxiety. Thanks everyone!

(One other thing he said that I found funny in a weird way - ""These things affect so many people - it could even affect your loved ones or yourself."" And I was thinking, ""I know, I was in bed due to anxiety when you knocked on the door."")",22,2014-01-07 01:42:25 EST-0500
986,In the ER and freaking out,"Noticed my eye was bloodshot when I took my contacts out and realized there was a bump on the white of my eye as well.

I have a compromised immune system as well, and I'm shaking and trying to breathe.  Anyone around?

Edit: thank you all for responding, you don't know how much better you made me feel.  I'm home now, the ER doc said it was viral conjunctivitis, and I have a follow up with an ophthalmologist tomorrow.  I feel a bit silly, but after all, we only have two eyes!  I took something to calm me down so I can get some sleep, here's hoping it works.  Thank you again.

Edit 2:  Home now and just waiting for the pharmacy to call and tell me my Rx is ready.  It's a viral infection, not conjunctivitis (which is also a viral infection), another ""itis,"" but I forget the exact words he used.

995,My First Therapy Session,"So today was my first therapy session. I was pretty nervous at first, it was a little awkward to just tell this stranger about all my most hated anxiety thoughts, but, she was really easy to talk to and never made me feel crazy. I was able to tell her about my family history and about my most recent panic attacks and the huge health anxiety I developed this year. Tomorrow I go talk to the doctor on staff for a physical evaluation (they like to do a full body treatment) and discuss possible medication to help me through this first phase. All in all I am happy with how it went. She was super reasonable about how I need to come semi weekly due to money. And she gave me a writing/art asignment to stay engaged between sessions. I'm glad I'm taking this step for my own well being. She says she's confident I can find my true potential and be all I can be.

My family is pretty volatile and I have two half brothers who are very young and are always screaming and being obnoxious.

1009,I'm terrified to check/reply to important emails,"Hi... I've had a history of avoiding texts/emails when they stress me out, but I've managed to do somewhat okay with that until last week.

I do freelance work, and I received an email Friday asking for updates, which I didn't have at the time. I ignored it and just wanted to get progress done over the weekend to send to them so I didn't have to respond with ""I don't have any updates right now"". But over the weekend they had sent a couple more emails, and I just got too anxious/scared to check those, because I feel like they are emails chewing me out. 

Its Tuesday now and I still haven't even read them. I told myself yesterday I'd check them and reply and sort everything out, but I didn't know how to explain my lack of response. I KNOW I have to do it NOW, but I'm still scared the emails might be negative and criticizing of my actions, and I'm still scared of what to say.

I just need any advice or words of encouragement. I already know what has to be done but a simple task like this feels so overwhelming. :(

**Edit:** I was forced into a more awkward situation when they CALLED me, and because of my iOS8/Yosemite set up, the phone call went straight to my computer AS I was typing, making me answer it by accident.. I panicked and hung up.. This was yesterday.. at that point I was planning to call back right away because it looked even worse to have answered and hung up. This was in the early afternoon, and my fear/anxiety was preventing me from making that call until 10PM at night! Horrible, I know. At one point I was literally sitting down for hours, torn between calling and not calling.

Eventually I made the call, but no answer.. the funny thing is, I called that number today and realized it was the wrong number after all (I'm an idiot). So no less than 10 minutes ago, I said ""fuck it"" and made the call... I gave the most sincerest of apologies, and tried to explain that it was a ""personal health incident"", and to my surprise, he was very sympathetic. He first made sure I was okay to continue the work, and from there we spoke business. 

I must say I still feel a bit of embarrassment having to communicate with other members of their team, AND I still have that weird feeling of anxiety/fear when looking through the emails I avoided, but none of them were THAT bad.. 

I just wanted to say thank you to everyone who shared their thoughts/feelings. I never knew how to explain this to anyone, but it definitely feels good to know that I'm not alone. This was by far the worst incident of the whole avoiding emails thing, but I will definitely follow some of your tips to avoid this type of situation. :)

**Edit 2:** FYI, when I said ""personal health incident"", I didn't try and fake a physical injury or anything. I was trying to explain it without saying ""anxiety"", and he understood what I was implying.",15,2014-10-14 21:00:38 EDT-0400

1013,I'm Proud of Myself Tonight,"I took my first dose of Lexapro today at about 1:45 pm this afternoon. I hadn't experienced any side effects other than being pretty drowsy. Prior to taking the dose (I'm starting on 10mg, generic), I had looked up reviews and generally agonized over taking it 2 days before I worked up the courage to take it.

* I'm proud of myself for actually taking my medicine.

Tonight around 6 I finally fell asleep until around 7 or so for a nap, and I woke up feeling nauseous and panicked. I kept my cool, took some Emetrol, laid down again. I got that scary, cold, tingly feeling of depersonalization that I get when I panic, but I kept my composure. I closed my eyes, breathed deeply, and just laid still. After about 10 or 15 minutes, I got up, drank some water, and felt so much better just after that.

* I'm proud of how brave I was to face that anxiety head on and just ride the wave.

For those of you who might be in a situation of ""should I take these meds or should I not"", I hope this story helps you decide for yourself what the best course of action will be.
For me, I was most afraid of nausea and vomiting because I have mild emetophobia. But it happened and I lived through it, and remembered to tell myself that the anxiety was just what I was feeling.

Anyone else want to share their success stories for their medicines? Let's be encouraging for the ones who are afraid to begin. I was so afraid I nearly started having panic attacks just thinking about the side effects. What finally convinced me was this logic: ""People are more likely to share negative reviews than positive ones. There might be side effects you won't like, but you've lived through worse and you never know how bad it'll really be until you try. Hope for the best but prepare for the worst.""
I did exactly that. And it wasn't nearly as bad or scary as I thought it'd be",18,2014-10-09 05:09:50 EDT-0400

1020,[Rant] I view every situation as if I'm going to die,"Hey /r/anxiety, I think I've found out what's going on with myself.

Well, since this summer I've always had anxiety about death... how I wouldn't be able to accomplish long term goals, how I wouldn't be able to experience life to its full, as I am only a young teenager (16).

I see every situation I'm in as if I'm going to die. Oh you touched something and didn't wash your hands? Dude you're going to die 40 years from now. You went outside and a dog sniffed you? Damn son, you have rabies, you're going to die in 2 weeks (this happened today). You're in a car? Wow, dude, this is it - your last day. Might as well embrace it in tranquility.

I have this outlook that I'm going to eventually die and be punished by the supposed laws of the universe because I do certain things. I'm not sure how to phrase this in words, but essentially every task I do has a way to dying - and I'm afraid I'm going to choose the way to death, whether it be immediate or 60 years from now.

I talked to a school counselor about my health anxiety and how death fucking scares me, but so far the therapy isn't helping and I feel like I'm forcing myself to go there to only satisfy my counselor (she wants me to meet every Thursday but I don't want to go because I'd rather do other things... I feel this is to a certain extent selfish but I can only overcome myself. I appreciate what my counselor is doing but it just is not working).

Seriously any tips on how to deal with this? Death? I feel like I cannot accept death for what it is. I have SHIT I want to do and I'm too young to actually accomplish the long term goals that I have.",8,2014-10-13 03:01:07 EDT-0400

I am stressed because I want to be able to make decent money. I don't want to make shit wage, but I'm also too young to be picky. I'm bloody nervous calling back people and places I applied for, but every day I am constantly sending in online applications as a shout into the void. I fluctuate constantly between happiness, then anxiety attacks creep up. I have a wonderful boyfriend in long distance right now, but should only be like that for a year. I feel like I keep comparing myself to him. He works in a trade and has had experience in it so he makes really great money. I want to be able to make as much as him. 

I feel like a failure because I KNOW I can do this. I just am not pushing myself hard enough, and I'm worried that I'm too focused on a magical job to come along and make me happy. I feel stuck. I just feel stuck. Any comforting thoughts, words, or advice would surely be appreciated. I need a severe pick me up. 

I'm trying to breathe. :( I know everything is going to be fine. I just don't know what the hell I'm doing with my life.

1023,Anxiety Post-Rape,"Hi everyone! Just a heads up that this post involves sexual assault and rape content.

I'm a college student who was raped by her boyfriend while still dating him, choked and had my life threatened by him, and then raped again when he broke into my apartment a few months after us breaking up. I went to my university and, after a long a tedious process, got him expelled from my school (it was his second offense after being previously suspended for sexual coercion). I've tried seeing a handful of therapists and finally found one I really like (yay!). Last night at our session, she told me I could talk about anything I wanted. That led me to discuss anxiety that was present in my current relationship that seemed really random. Turns out, it's my subconscious pulling in stress from what I went through but my conscious blocks out those feelings on a day to day basis. I realized that I don't want to allow my ex to cause me any more harm so my brain tries to just ignore everything he did to me. So, basically, I'm paranoid about being cheated on and being abandoned and feeling that much pain again and allowing it to affect my current relationship through general anxiety and worry about my boyfriend cheating on me (although I know he never would..). And part of my problem comes from feeling like I cheated on my current boyfriend when I was raped the second time even though he tries to convince me otherwise and that he doesn't blame me at all.

SO I'm posting in hopes of getting ideas on how to address my feelings towards my ex in order to be happier in my current relationship. All ideas are appreciated!!",4,2014-10-08 18:36:55 EDT-0400

1028,"Drugs Are Great, M'kay!","I used to search Reddit for anxiety/depression success stories, so I thought now that I'm on the uphill slope I should share mine.

I also want to share my story because there is a bit of an 'anti-SSRI' bias on Reddit which I know stopped me from taking medication when It shouldn't have.

I started getting really bad bouts of depression/anxiety over two years ago, sparked by the death of a friend. Looking back, I had always been a bit 'up and down' with my moods for no reason, but it was following this period of grief that I started to really go down hill.

I had the usual symptoms: thinking about death a lot, constant generalised anxiety, constant rumination of bad things that were to happen. I also had some unique concerns: I was overly preoccupied with my relationship. I would obsess for days about whether I loved my boyfriend, whether I was attracted to him and whether or not I should break up with him. I essentially fit that 'Relationship-OCD' pattern to a tee.

Having read about all the studies indicating that for 'mild' depression/anxiety SSRIs are no better than a placebo, and reading a lot of horror stories online, I decided that CBT and meditation would be how I would beat this thing. 

I saw two therapist for about 8 months. They were nice, but beyond the typical CBT technique I don't think I gained much insight from the process. I was able to recognise bad thought patterns, 'let them happen' but for some reason that didn't help ease the anxiety nor make the anxiety more tolerable. Meditation was also nice, in those moments of meditative trance I was calm, but as soon as meditation ended so did the calm.

This went on for two years, and to great detriment to my relationship and my personal view of life. It hit a critical point where I had to do something drastic, so I went to my doctor  and was prescribed 20mg Citalopram (Celexa).

The first three weeks on it were pretty shit: tired all the time, feeling drugged out and not really feeling much of a benefit.  However, the side effects went away. It was really only after I was on it for 2 months or so that I started to notice a benefit.. very gradually though.

Because the change was so gradual, I actually had to stop and take notice before I realised how much of a benefit it has been. I no longer needlessly worry about my relationship, I no longer lie awake obsessing about death, I no longer feel ridiculously worried about every little thing. It has completely transformed me! I can honestly say this is the best I've felt in over 2 years, and I owe it all to these drugs! 

Honestly, the ongoing side-effects have been pretty minimal. It will effect your sex life, but I imagine not in the drastic way that most people on Reddit suggest. Really all it has meant for me is that I need a little longer (say 5 minutes longer) of 'warm up' before anything. 

So here is my advice: if therapy isn't working or you have a family history of the illness (which I did) give medication a shot! 

Hopefully this story will help someone.

1030,My sister is sucking the life out of our whole family and I don't know how to talk to her about it.,"Hi, I apologize for the rant and hope that it does not upset anyone. My adult sister has had so many problems her whole life and I am just flat out sick of it and have no idea how to approach her anymore.

She has had and still has an eating disorder. It seems to swing from anorexia to bulimia.  She has attempted suicide several times and been sectioned for it. Every time she has taken a lot of pills then immediately told someone and been taken to hospital. 
She has anxiety attacks and general anxiety. She can't start or hold a conversation with anyone other than her friends. I have been married for ten years and she has never, ever even said hello to my husband. 

She mooches off everybody because she is too anxious to get a job. Currently she lives with our very ill, elderly father and has him driving her about all over and buying her things. If she does not get her own way over anything then she threatens to kill herself. When she does speak to me she is passive aggressive, if I call her on anything she becomes openly aggressive. Due to her 'illness' she believes that the whole family should accommodate her over every little thing. 

My dad is a shell of a man because he is constantly frightened of what she will do. She is vile to him (somehow her anxiety disappears and she can be a bitch to him). She goes out drinking with her friends (she has two odd friends that also have eating disorders) then calls my dad at 2am to come and get then from the club. How come she is not anxious in a night club or bar?

She is seeing a dietitian once a week, a psychologist once a week and a councilor once a week. Every week. Up till now she has had everyone's sympathy and support. She has no idea how I am beginning to feel. 

   I think that she is an attention seeker. I think that the anxiety thing is a cop out to avoid working. She makes a huge big deal about 'her pills' and leaves them lying around so people can see them. She announces  new illnesses all the time and is always harping on about 'triggers'. She is 'wiser' than everyone else because of her 'terrible life'.

I love her but how much can we take? Why is her health more important than everyone else's? She is literally killing my father (our mother died a long time ago), my youngest sister moved out at age 17 because she could not take it anymore, my brother never visits and I feel unwelcome in my family home (which i part own).

 I am so frustrated.  I just don't see her ever getting better and I'm struggling to differentiate between somebody who has a mental illness and somebody who is acting like an asshole. How do you call somebody like this on their behavior? Her illness has become a get out of jail free card and I'm sick of it.  How do I approach her with out becoming the bad guy?

1032,Run down of day surgery and General Anaesthetic at an NHS (UK) hospital for anyone anxious about it.,"I wanted to write down my experience of my operation yesterday for anyone who might have something similar coming up and searched this subreddit for reassurance. I couldn't find many posts from British hospital experiences so just wanted to put this here in case it helps anyone!

Yesterday I had a General Anaesthetic to remove a cyst in day surgery and I have to say, I was absolutely taken aback by how easy and non terrifying the process was. I had been suffering really awful anxiety in the run up to it, and the fact that the NHS don't tend to give you a lot of information beforehand meant I had googled away and focussed on all kinds of complications and side effects. 

It went like this: I went in at 7.30am and sat on a little ward with around 8 other women. A nurse came around and ran through some basic questions and did my general obs. Then the anaesthetist came around to see me. He was great, immediately reassuring me as I explained my many fears. As it wasn't going to be a long operation I only had to have a soft little tube just at the opening of my throat - no tube into my lungs. He also said that he would give me an anti sickness medication before I came round, and that it wouldn't make me feel woozy or sleepy. 

Then the surgeon came around and explained exactly what she would be doing and answered a few of my questions. 

At about 10am I changed into a gown and got on the bed to be wheeled over for surgery. I panicked a tiny bit at this point and cried a little, but the nurses were fantastic, chatting away and distracting me. In a side room I had a canula inserted by a student doctor. She got it first try and I felt next to nothing. The anaesthetist let me know that he was first giving me a little something to make me relaxed. I told him I was terrified of sedation but he reassured me it was very gentle - more like a large glass of wine, and he was right. I had been worried about the proposition of a pre-med (lots of people in the US mentioned this) I'm not a massive fan of sedatives, and envisioned sitting on a ward freaking out on ativan. But this was 30 seconds of very slight relaxation right before I was put under. The lovely nurse held my hand and I have no memory of the actual anaesthetic going in. 

The next thing I remember is waking up in recovery. This was the part that I'd lost the most sleep over beforehand. But I was really pleasantly surprised. I have a vague memory of the soft airway tube coming out and then I was completely awake. No disorientation, no grogginess, no sickness. I was immediately aware of where I was and what had happened. I wasn't in any pain and didn't feel strange at all. 

The nurse wheeled me back and I hung out on the ward and drank tea and ate biscuits for an hour or two. The surgeon came back around and explained what she'd found and what to expect from the healing process. After another set of obs from the nurse I went on my way around 2pm and my mum drove me home. I felt completely normal and relieved.

Pain has been very minimal and controllable with paracetamol and ibuprofen. This morning I woke up with a slight headache but nothing worse. 

Sorry for the incredibly long post. I know this is a slightly niche area, but I just wanted to post because if I'd have known more what to expect beforehand I would have been able to deal with the horrible anticipation anxiety so much better. ",15,2014-10-28 16:53:10 EDT-0400

Mild depression eventually accompanied the problem so that just all made me super anxious over everything. Lately, maybe the past month or so, I've learned to just accept it's what I have and to deal a little better. But I've noticed recently that caffeine- primarily coffee- REALLY sets it off. I mean it only takes maybe 3 or 4 sips and I get palpitations shortness of breath and de-realization, which are all common symptoms for me. Is this normal? Thanks in advance guys.

1039,My fiancée just started a new blog to help deal with her anxiety and depression,"I've been lurking on this subreddit ever since I found out my fiancée suffered from severe anxiety and depression a couple years ago to try and get some sense of what she was going through and what I could do to help. It hasn't been easy and still isn't but I love her to bits and would do it all over again in an instant. 

Recently she decided that she wanted to write a blog for a couple of reasons. 

The first is that she felt that there wasn't much out there talking about mental health issues from the perspective of a young person who has dealt and is dealing with them, and would have dearly loved to have found something like that when she was first struggling to come to terms with it.

The second is that she wanted something that she could be accountable to and also provide her with a way to talk about and cope with her own ongoing struggles with mental health.

I decided to post it here in the hopes that maybe it can reach someone that is looking for something like this. After all the main aim for my fiancée is just to help one person, even if she never finds out about it.

I can't do this anymore, though. I worry about death constantly. Even knowing it might not be for decades doesn't make it better. The simple thought that one day, INEVITABLY, I will simply just cease to exist... Well.. There's no easy way to explain how much it scares me.

1060,How I beat anxiety...for now.,"It's been over a month now since I took any Xanax.  I used to get anxiety about taking it.  I used to get anxiety about everything.  The last three months of 2013 were so bad that I was starting to get heart palpitations.  I decided enough was enough and that I had to do more than see a doctor and get a script.

Around Christmas I ran in to a guy who is a life coach.  Yeah, I thought it sounded silly too but he gave me some great advice.  He told me that I'm focusing too much on the future and things that I don't have.  Yeah, so?  Doesn't everyone do that?  It turns out that not everyone does.  He recommended a book to me called ""The Power of Now"".  I didn't read it right away. 

Another friend of me told me to check out these videos on YouTube by a guy named Alan Watts.  Then he told me that there's a great book by Watts that would help my anxiety called ""Wisdom of Insecurity"".  So I picked up a copy.

This book was pretty heavy.  I didn't understand a lot of it but I kept reading it and enjoyed what I did understand.  It was a lot about just allowing life to happen naturally and to not obsess on what I don't have.  From here I read Power of Now by Eckhart Tolle.  By the time I was finished with this, I was in auto pilot.

Auto pilot? Yes, as in I don't have to think so much about living in the moment, not obsessing about the future and saying ""what if"" about the past.  I'm here right now and that's all that matter.  The whole world is opening up to me now and I'm seeing beauty in it all.  It's an extraordinary place we live, this earth.

Call me a hippie if you want but I almost feel cured of anxiety.  Maybe I am, but I tend to think that I've learned to keep it pushed to the background and forgotten about.  Yes, it could come back if I start to go back to my old ways but I know how to manage it now.  By observing that feeling of anxiety, focusing on the present moment and seeing beauty in the world, I'm so much more happy now.

Thank you for letting me share my story with you all.

In the end I got her to get back into her pyjamas and get back into bed where she feels safe and comfortable and told her to try and go back to sleep for a while. The panic attack lasted for about an hour and a half before she went back to bed. 

In the mean time, I proceeded to follow up with her work, explaining why she just didn't turn up (It was now about 40 minutes past the time she was supposed to be there). I was quite surprised with their responses, I was hit with things like ""this is the real word, you can't just not turn up without notice"" and ""you should have called us as soon as you knew she wasn't coming in"". ...Well yes, this *is* the real world and mental illness *is* a real thing. I realised that people don't seem to understand the severity of mental illness. For example, if I had called and said we were in a car accident and I was trying to manage my girlfriends injuries so I had no time to call and let them know she was not going to be turning up today I would have been greeted with a completely different response. They would have been sympathetic, concerned and completely understanding of why I hadn't contacted them immediately after the accident. So I though, is a panic attack actually *that* different from a car accident?

In a car accident you go through a traumatic event that can cause injury, if these injuries are not immediately managed they can lead to fatality. Therefore it is highly important that you manage the problem right away, you don't have the luxury of time. If the victim is bleeding out, they will eventually die of blood loss. You need to be there and make sure you manage that bleeding so it does not become fatal. If you divert your attention for even a brief period of time (like to call up and have ""the talk"", explaining why a mental illness is a legitimate thing and means you are incapable of coming in to work sometimes) there might be enough damage done to cause some severe long term effects.

A car accident is quite convenient really, you can visually see the problem in front of you, and you can take the right course of action to resolve it (like applying pressure to a bleeding wound). A mental illness is quite the opposite. You have no idea how to help. Here is an example of my efforts; once she realised she was having a panic attack, I tried calming exercises (slow controlled breathing), distraction (getting our pet rabbit for some cuddles!), I tried getting her dressed and removing her from the dark bedroom and sitting out in the lounge, I tried talking though the problem, I tried minimising and rationalising the problem, I tried to create a discussion about the book she is currently reading (distraction), I tried to just cuddle her (calming), I tried to justify her panic (to reduce the conflict and disappointment in her head over not being able to go to work), I tried to tell her that she doesn't need this job and we are fine for money and I tried putting her back into her pyjamas and putting her back into the dark bedroom. A lot of these things helped, and in the end, after going through this process we did manage to get some control over the attack. 

So now, think of a panic attack like a car accident. You have a traumatic event, that you need to immediately manage and it requires all of your attention. Now the tricky part, just like a car accident, a panic attack can also lead to fatality, although not in such a clear way. Untreated mental illness has a high mortality rate, but it comes in an often unforeseeable form. If you let any event, such as a panic attack, go by untreated and without sympathy or care, this event can cause severe long term effects on the victim. This one single event can sit idle in the mind of the victim for days, weeks or even years and at any time spring forth trigger an even more severe mental event. The worst case scenario is it triggers an event (like severe depression) and can lead the victim, out of sheer desperation, to the only form of relief that can finally end the suffering; Suicide. 

So as you can now see, although almost invisible compared to a car accident, mental illness can be just as traumatic and devastating on the victim's life and also the people that are there to support them. When in a situation like this, your first priority is the health and well being of your partner, the same as if you were in a car accident, and secondly (once they feel like the panic and anxiety has subdued) is to provide a courtesy call to whomever will be affected as a result of the panic attack (your boss, a friend you are meeting, etc.). I think people need to realise that this is the real world, and there are things out there that they do not necessarily understand, but it is a real (potentially life threatening) issue and it has a serious impact on people's lives and (in an ideal world) should be met with a similar level compassion and concern as a car accident.

1065,To those who have been anxious since childhood...,"I don't really know where else to write this, but I needed to put it somewhere out into the universe, so here it is.

I've had anxiety and panic attacks since I was in the 5th grade, around when I was 10. I'm 25 now. I don't remember what it was like before my anxiety. In many ways, I feel like anxiety has robbed me of the life I was meant to have, and I feel an incredible amount of bitterness about that. There are things that I dreamed of doing (and even had the opportunity to do) that I had to turn down because of my anxiety. I have constant feelings of regret and guilt.

I feel like I don't know how to be a functioning human. Everything in my brain gets filtered through my anxiety, so I can never tell if I'm making a decision because it's something I want, or because it's what's expected of me or because it will cause me less anxiety. I spend most of my life simply trying to move forward, looking at my feet, trying to keep the future at a blurry distance so I won't have to worry.
I'm tired. I've been dealing with this for 15 years. 

So this is my plea to the universe...is there anyone out there who is in my shoes? I've met people who have had anxiety, but they've all been much older than me, and in general, their anxiety started later in life. Are there those of you out there who have had anxiety since you were young? Did it get any better as time went on? Do you ever feel the things I've described?

I have no one else to talk to about this, and I just want a connection to someone who understands the pain I've been dealing with for the last 15 years...anyone?",37,2014-03-06 05:22:52 EST-0500

Doesn't matter if it's the one I dated for 2 years and broke up with 4 years ago, or the one I dated for a month last year. Even the sight of them in a photograph brings on that sudden stab of anxiety, the tightness in the chest, the nauseous punch in the guts. I don't have feelings for these guys any longer,so it's not like I'm just languishing away mooning over them. 

I've been on antidepressants since last year and am doing a thousand times better in every area of my mental health except this one thing. It's really a problem, because I still see some of them regularly at events. Yes, I've tried taking time away from those events to give myself a little space, but even if its months later the sight of them is like a system shock.

I feel like this is the last piece in rebuilding my mental health. Does anyone have any suggestions? DEALING with these feelings isn't the issue (deep breaths, etc etc), I need to stop them from happening in the first place.",8,2014-03-03 22:07:07 EST-0500
1068,100 days without an anxiety/panic attack,"Hello Community,

I used to have General Anxiety Disorder and sometimes I even had Panic attacks. Today is my 100st day without any attack. I would not say I am cured yet though, I still have some slight symptoms from time to time, but nothing compared to the attacks I used to have.

I thought maybe some of you would be interested in hearing my story, therefore and cause I am somewhat proud of me finally reaching the 100 days i decided to share it.

It all started last early summer, where I started to have attacks in which I felt back pain, heart racing, a tight feeling in my throat which made me choke, or getting sick and even have to throw up sometimes. The hardest of the symptoms was the feeling of having to throw up, in some situations this was really unbearable.

It took some time I finally figured out that I was suffering from Anxiety Disorder and it took sometime until I got myself into doing a therapy. For those who are interested, I am doing a concentrative movement therapy ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concentrative_movement_therapy ) it's not so common as like CBT for example, also takes a lot more time, but seems to be a lot more in dept and more permanently. I personally really really like it and can recommend it.

Anyway things actually got worse after summer, the fall was quite a hard time for me, even normal daily life became challening because of the fear of having an anxiety attack. 

Than 100 days ago from now I had the worst panic attack ever, it was on a trainride home to my parents, the symptoms where so hard I nearly fainted, but made it throw. Also on the same day I got very sick. I had a very bad flu and it seemed like it wont go away anymore. 1 and a half week after things got even worse, I couldn`t get up anymore, neither walk, I couldnt feel most of my body anymore, also I saw every thing with double vision. I was hospitalized, had a lot of tests done and got a lot of infusions. After 4 really horrible days the cortisone infusion finally started to effect and 1 week after the day I got into hospital, i made my first steps again. Then it was a lot of physiotherapy and getting fit again. Only very much later they finally figured out I am having Nero myelitis optica, a very rare autoimun disease, which causes inflammations in the back spine and therefore effecting the nervous system. After a bit more than a month I was finally released from the hospital, at that time I was like 90% percent recovered again.

The thing is, with the day I got into hospital, i didn`t have any anxiety attack anymore. It is hard to say what actually made them go away, or even if this two diseases are connected somewhat, but all I can say is that I never felt better than the last 2 months. (pretty much the time I got out from hospital until now, even the last couple of weeks in hospital i was doing very good already mentally)

I got a lot more loose, easy and happy about the things I have. I believe it was this kind of catastrophe which made me realize things and changed my mind, but I also think the therapy (which I am still doing on a weekly base) had a lot of impact. It's really very hard to figure out what exactly did change, but I think the one of the core things is the following: 

I believe things that must or must not happen where one of the basic triggers of my anxiety attacks. For example if I rode on the train, I obviously didnt want to have an anxiety attack. This created such a pressure, that actually created one. So every situation, in which I thought I couldn`t afford having an attack, I would likely have one. I hope you get what you mean. All the kind of obligations I set for myself or others did, created this immense pressure and I think they created my Anxiety.

Also now I am accepting the way I am a lot more. In my bad times I always to change the way I am, wanted to be somebody else. Now I still want to grow in terms of personality, but its a different approach. I accept myself with all my flaws and want to grow from that kind of perspecitve, which is much healtier than just want to be somebody else.

Now I am able to see this a lot more easy, if something bad happens, I just let it allow to happen. I dont need to force anything anymore, and this is really a release for me. Of course I still have days where I feel down or even anxious and do have some symptoms, but until now it didn`t really effect me anymore.

I wish you all the best in overcoming and dealing with your disorder and for all of you who are at a very bad place right now and it doesn`t seem to end, have hope, I was at the same place as well a few months ago.

1073,"Recovering agoraphobic here, introducing myself","I say recovering because anxiety issues will always be a part of my life, although it is nearly non-existent. I just want to write this out here and let anyone reading this sub know my story. Hopefully it can provide some inspiration or some help.

I'm my mid-30s now and live in a huge urban metropolitan area. I take public transit everywhere (that occasionally gets stuck!), been on three international trips/flights, and fly domestically 5-6x / year.

In my late teens my anxiety was so bad I couldn't leave the driveway without having a full blown, all-out crippling attack, like clockwork. I had considered suicide briefly but was too scared to do that. The very instant I woke up in the morning, I would long for it to be nighttime so I could go back to sleep so I could escape the anxiety.

The only thing I had going for me was my mother understood and would buy me a carton of smokes every 2 weeks. It was the one pleasure I had; everything else like eating, television, reading, dialing up BBS's/internet were mere aversions and was just to pass the time until it was time to go to sleep to truly escape.

I started taking prozac which helped a little, but the big breaking point was when my mother threatened to have me committed if I didn't leave the house and go to a shrink. I wanted to go, but was too damn scared to get in the car. I don't know if she was serious or bluffing but I figured one way or the other I was going to leave the house and if I died outside of it, then at least I wouldn't suffer anymore.

So I got in the car.

About 3 blocks later I was hyperventilating and every single muscle in my body had cramped up, heart racing a zillions beats per minute, and every square mm on my body was either number or had the pins and needles feeling. I remember my hands were crumpled in an odd shape, like rigor mortis had set in, I couldn't clutch anything at all.

At this time my mother made it across town but agreed to take me to the doctors office instead. I remember arriving in the parking lot, realizing where I was, and all the sudden immediately began to feel better. I gradually calmed down, and basked in the glory of stepping outside of a car and standing on the sweet, beautiful asphault in the parking lot outside of a non-descript building that contained a doctors office.

It was the most exciting thing that happened to me in three years.

After that it was game over, I was comfortable with walking on my own and setting goals, going along for rides, and stretching my limits. Whenever I had another attack come on I would laugh it off and tell myself nothing will ever be as bad as that big one. I was able to work at a restaurant a couple blocks away and be work shifts, over the years I became more independent then moved to the big city, ~550 miles away.

I still get anxious and have some setbacks at times, but one of the biggest things that I believe that helps me is diet. I consume high potassium (banana twice a day, lots of potatoes, etc). The biggest change, and maybe it was psychological, was going vegetarian and nearly vegan diet. For years, the majority of my attacks were just after eating way too much, a nice heavy meal with ton of meat, then would go walking around with a stuffed gut, then the palpatations would set in. 

Exercise and taking showers help provide relief when I'm feeling amped up and I know I have to go somewhere soon but feeling a bit to anxious and wish I could get out of having to go somewhere. And of course a beer or two provides excellent relief.

If anyone needs a pen-pal or someone to vent to, send me a private message, I'd be happy to help out in any way I can! I know it's a cliche, but if I can get through this, anyone can.

I was just about to leave school because I was sick, I get outside to my dads truck when we see several emergency cars- police, fire, etc. I knew it wasn't a drill unlike my dad, and he wouldn't let me out the car to check on my favorite teacher so I went home and tried several times to call my friends to see what was going on and for someone to check on my teacher (she's like a sister to me, well call her Ms W). I pace around my room for a while, crying and struggling to breathe normally. I had the worst anxiety attack then more than ever before. I email my teacher, knowing it would be a while until everyone would be allowed back in the school, but I needed to do something. I was tempted to ride my bike to the high school to find my teacher; I was so worried about her.
Fast forward- this happened around 10am, at 12pm my teacher finally emailed me back. Everyone was okay, it was a fake from some punk student. Students were being picked up to go home and at 2pm, everyone was allowed backed to get their stuff. I figured I'd go back, even though I didn't need my bag at all, but I needed to see Ms W. I go there and get my bag and see Ms W. I give her a hug, saying I was glad she and everyone was ok while another teacher is in her classroom and she is crying for whatever reason (she's a bit emotional). Well, i have a big history competition tomorrow, I am a big history buff on WWII and was chosen by another teacher to go to a statewide competition. Well, I was excited until my poster went missing and I realized I would have to make another and on top of that I freaked out because I will have to speak. Ms W knew about me losing my poster yesterday and offered to help. As I was hugging her today, she asked me about the poster. I said I didn't want to go anymore, she told me ""You can do it!"" She always supports me. I thought about it for a while and while driving home with my mom her voice kept echoing on my head, she would always tell me when I am scared or say I can't do something ""You can do it!"" Or ""not with that attitude!""
So I made up my mind, I will work on a new poster and go tomorrow. I will punch anxiety in the face and do my biggest fear- present. Ms W is my biggest inspiration, I didn't want to regret not going to something I will probably regret if I don't. I will ""Knock their socks off!""

1092,Not sure if I have been abusing Xanax. Will I experience withdrawal? Please help if you can.,"I recently turned 21, female btw. Sometimes, when I have a really stressful day, my mother will give me some of her Xanax so I can sleep that night. Over the course of 145 days, I have taken about 42 pills of .25mg Xanax. This is really the high estimate though, I think I may have actually taken less. Not all in a row obviously. I space them out, but not evenly. 

Somewhere around day 72, I took a three week break in which I consumed zero pills. I did not experience any withdrawal whatsoever. I stopped around this time because it was winter break and because I did not have school, nothing was stressing me out. So yes, school stresses me out BIG TIME. I'm in pre-medicine so it's a lot of work and competition.  After the three weeks, I then resumed randomly taking Xanax. In the majority of weeks, I'd take two per week. Sometimes, even one per week. **Again, this is the majority of the time.** 

HOWEVER, the past two weeks have been seriously stressful for me. I have taken maybe 7-8 pills within 13 days or so. I am really concerned whether I'll experience withdrawal, however minor it may be. Also, I don't want to ask my doctor about this because I know he'll be mad at both myself and my mother. 

tl;dr 42 pills of .25mg Xanax in 145 days. took them randomly. most of the time only took 2 per week. What kind of withdrawal will I experience, if any? ",19,2014-03-08 19:43:29 EST-0500

This was my first experience with anything like this, so I really don't know, but I couldn't find anything else it could be. It just seems odd that I could suddenly have one, but I guess there's a first for everything. Anyway, the story.

About a week and a half ago, I had a bit of a freak out at work. To preface, I went in feeling completely fine. Granted, it was after a long and busy week, but I had gotten a good amount of sleep and ate breakfast before hand, as well as no more caffeine than normal.

About an hour into my shift, I started getting kind of tired. No big deal, it happens. However, it was a problem for my job (McDonald's, where being fast is necessary). At one point, I guess I just didn't hear my coworker say he needed nuggets, because a way higher-up supervisor (who was doing an inspection of our store) roughly grabbed me and yelled ""they need nuggets, now!""

This is where I went downhill. My face and hands started going numb and I started feeling extremely dizzy. I tried to wait it out, but after a few minutes it was clear that I wasn't going to last the remaining six-and-a-half hours of my shift. I tried getting the closest manager's attention, but I found I could barely speak. Finally, I managed to say ""I can't do this"" and communicated that I felt like I was going to collapse any second.

They got me to the break room, where I immediately sat down and busted into tears uncontrollably (harder than I've cried in seriously probably a decade, I didn't even know I could still cry like that). I was sent home right after that. I felt off and continue crying in my car for about 15 minutes before I felt comfortable driving. Not too long after, I felt completely fine again.

What really worries me is that it will happen again. Like I said, it's never happened before. Nothing close has happened before, and it seemed completely out of nowhere. Does this sound like something that could reoccur?",9,2014-03-12 20:40:20 EDT-0400
1095,Coffee induced panic attack?,"I had my first panic attack last night after almost a year without symptoms. I took some deep breaths, and rode it out. It lasted almost an hour.

This morning, after breakfast.... another panic attack. Same thing. I resolved not to give in to the frustration and fear, and allow the symptoms to subside. However... after some deduction I have narrowed down the stressor that seems to be the one thing different than the usual... excessive coffee consumption. Last night, I had had about 4 cups of coffee. This morning, only a single cup, and then boom; hot flashes, tachycardia, dizziness, sweating, a general sense of malaise and overwhelming fear. 

I'm positive that this was caused by coffee consumption. I will abstain from caffeine for then next 72 hours, and keep r/anxiety posted if I exhibit symptoms. I definitely think coffee is the culprit, here!  

Update: Man, you really appreciate how GREAT it is to feel normal after experiencing a panic episode. For instance, my apartment is a place where I really feel happy. I keep it clean. It's old, but nice. Yet, last night it seemed dark and just bad. Everything is so bad when you have anxiety. I had truly almost forgotten how horrible anxiety really is. It's actually good to be reminded how awful the symptoms made me feel. I'll be a better nurse that way. Thanks for the upvotes and support! No. More. Coffee.",20,2014-03-11 19:10:31 EDT-0400

1101,Today I ordered food all by myself for the first time in ages,"Possible Trigger Warning (!)

There is this giant fancy mall near the university campus. I frequent that place a lot, mostly the convenience store. I ordered food before, I ate at the university dinning hall countless times. It's just feels different, looks different, I don't know how to describe it to you. My agoraphobia and social anxiety, inferiority complex(?) deny me the opportunity to visit such kind of places always making me feel incredibly uneasy.

So today I had some positive reinforcement in class ( :) ) and decided to treat myself to some Western style food at the food court. I decided to tame my anxiety even if it's only temporary. There were so many vendors. I looked around, picked one that would be the most easy to approach (the menu was printed on the counter). That would be easier for me because you don't actually have to talk to place your order (I stutter), you just point at the item, and that's pretty much it. So long story short, I take the order, occupy the only vacant table... in the the middle of the court, sweating through my shirt (at this point). I took a sip of soda, calmed myself down a little bit and prepared myself for the delicious treat that is the hamburger. So that's it, guys. One tiny step to a better life.

1102,Completely quitting coffee and eliminating all forms of caffeine has led to a drastic reduction in my anxiety levels. Highly recommend quitting caffeine if you suffer from anxiety or a panic disorder.,"I have been an avid coffee drinker for at least ten years (also diet soda). Due to my growing dependence/reliance on it and inability to function without it, I knew I had to quit all forms of caffeine. The caffeine withdrawal was extremely physically taxing--I experienced monstrous headaches and unbelievable levels of lethargy/fatigue. However, once it was over (5 days after I decided to quit), I experienced this new refreshed feeling I hadn't felt since I was a child. I noticed I developed a new mental clarity/acuteness and a palpable decline in my anxiety levels. I also am able to sleep much better and have no problems falling asleep as I did before (I am an insomniac). I highly recommend quitting all forms of caffeine (soda, coffee, whatever) if you want to reduce anxiety. Coffee definitely exacerbates or possibly even causes panic attacks, anxiety, and insomnia.",76,2014-12-18 18:22:01 EST-0500
1103,You're all incredibly brave,"I've suffered from anxiety on different levels for years, from the completely debilitating, the benign and the one that makes you question your sanity. I wouldn't express myself as any authority on the subject but just like all of you I know how bad it gets.
But we're all capable of understanding and overcoming our anxiety, We all have the courage to become more than our affliction. Some days or everyday we may feel like giving up, we feel like its all too much to bear, but we're not alone, nothing is impossible and it will ALWAYS get better. 
Don't stop believing in yourself and even though I have no face to place against all the people that visit, read and comment on this reddit, we have one thing in common and if we can all come together to talk and support each other, then theres no stopping us.",15,2014-12-21 16:33:55 EST-0500

1105,"Does anyone else find it extremely anxiety-inducing to finish things, or they don't finish them because of anxiety they know it will give them?","I haven't always felt like this but for the last few years—after a lot of my mental health issues worsened. But its practically impossible for me to finish anything without heavy amounts of anxiety? Books, movies, shows, music sometimes. And its not just the ""oh I'm sad because its over"" but like...For my entire life I've used these things as coping mechanisms, and now I can't bear for them to conclude? It took me two plus weeks to watch the last two episodes of BSG. There's upwards of ten shows I've never finished. Tens of books. I never read the last handful of pages or the last episode. 

Its to the point where I don't really watch movies/tv shows or read books anymore. I've only seen four or five new movies in the last three or four years. I only really watch shows that I had seen previously a bunch of times. 

Its hard to explain. I learned one of my other friends kinda feels the same, but I don't see them much so I don't have a way to talk about it with them. 

But its just a part of my anxiety issues, and it gets so bad. It translates into other places in my life, too, like going places or being with friends. Do other people relate to this at all? Is this a thing; not being able to end things or start new things for the fear of it ending?

It seems so silly and ridiculous because its just like...a TV show or a movie but its upsetting because like I said, these things are coping mechanisms and I love them so much. How do I get over this??",12,2014-12-15 03:58:40 EST-0500

1109,"[HELP] I [26F] want to understand and help my sister [24F] with her anxiety, but I am frustrated with her ""victim"" attitude.","My sister ""Mary"" has had anxiety problems most of her adult life.  For a little background on her, she has had trouble transitioning into adulthood.  She went to community college for about 6 years, trying to finish an AA degree.  Her progress was slowed by many dropped classes and failed quarters.  She recently has been doing much better in a lot of ways - she is enrolled in an online program to get a 4-year degree, she is working a part-time job, and she started seeing a psychiatrist for the first time ever.

I cannot stress how proud I am of her, or how important and special she is to me.  However, I can't help but feel that her attitude towards her anxiety is creating a lot of interpersonal problems for her.  She acts like a victim.

Mary and I share the same group of friends and, obviously, the same family.  I feel like she uses her anxiety as an excuse to treat her family and friends poorly sometimes, or expects other people to tailor their behavior so as to not upset her.  She can be very abrasive to our friends when she doesn't like the way they are acting.  For instance, our group plays tabletop RPGs together.  She can be very hostile towards other players if they take actions she does not agree with.  I think the other players take it as her being a bitch, but I know her well enough to tell that she feels justified in believing that others should modify their behavior to make her feel more comfortable.

She will also outright bring up her anxiety when she wants other people to change the way they are acting.  For instance, I was visiting home the other day (my sister lives with our parents) and my dad and I were having a debate - not even a real argument, just a spirited back-and-forth discussion.  She felt uncomfortable (she has never liked our debates) so she sulkily said ""You guys are really testing my anxiety medication right now.""  I feel like she expects the rest of the world to change to accommodate her mental health issues.

I really do sympathize with her.  I have bipolar type II and I know living with mental illness is no picnic.  However, I can't help but feel she is dooming herself to a miserable life by acting like a victim.  She expects the world to change to make her life easier - I just don't think she is being realistic.  As sufferers of mental illnesses, we have to fight harder than everyone else to live a normal life, and yes, it is a struggle, but I believe it is our responsibility to overcome our issues, not everyone else's.

Am I being too hard on her?  Do I just not understand what it's like to live with anxiety?  I want to help her stop being a victim, but I don't know if she wants my help or even believes there is anything wrong with her behavior.  If I am being totally unreasonable, feel free to let me know.  I won't lie, my motives are somewhat selfish.  Her behavior does annoy me.  But I also want her to live a happy life.  I don't know if she can achieve that with her current mindset.

**tl;dr: My sister uses her anxiety problem as an excuse to act like a victim.  Am I unreasonable/insensitive for being bothered by this?  How can I approach her about this?  Can/should I help her?** ",50,2014-12-15 18:20:16 EST-0500

ive been suffering from depression and anxiety my entire life and its gotten much worse over the past few months. I have a group of work friends Ive talked to and for the most part they have been supportive. A few days ago one of them told me that she didnt want to be friends anymore. She said she ""Didnt wanna keep trying to make me happy"". I agree that i havent been the easiest person to be around lately. Anyway, since then Ive been paranoid that shes been badmouthing me to everyone else at work. Ive been filled with this paranoia and yesterday I let it get the best of me. I checked her phone.....I know, fucking stupid and everything. What I saw horrified me. She and a few of the co-workers I had told were actually making fun of my illness via text conversation. Doing things like showing each other pictures of my conversations at my lowest point and saying that i was just trying to make them feel guilty and all that. I dont know the extent of who has been talking about my but now I just feel lost, like I dont have anyone at work anymore. I have no idea what these people are telling my co-workers....

1111,[Feedback] I have panic disorder and I made a game to help myself breathe properly - can you help me make it work for as many people as possible?,"This is my first time posting here! I checked with the mods that this post would be OK.

6 years ago on New Years Eve I experienced my first really terrible panic attack. So instead of celebrating with my friends I was alone away from the party and convulsing, desperately struggling for breath. It took me ages to look for professional help, and in the time in between my life pretty much fell apart because I felt like I was definitely about to die at least once a day. 

When I did get help I found breathing retraining exercises to be a great tool to manage attacks, but hard to stick to! I love games so I designed one called Flowy that is controlled by your breathing and helps you to do them whenever you need. It’s not designed to cure your anxiety (and it won’t!) but it’s a tool to help you manage your symptoms - hopefully while you find professional care!  

With the help of some great people who know way more than me about research and psychology I ran a randomised controlled trial testing the app - it was small but found some really promising results! Now together we really want to test it with as many people as possible so we’re asking for your help!

If a game existed to help combat symptoms of panic attacks, what features would you like it to have? Would you be interested in testing the [app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.playlab.flowyfree&hl=en_GB) ? Have you had a similar experience? All feedback appreciated :)

EDIT: During calibration, please make sure to release your finger just after your deep breath, and **before** holding your breath and exhaling; this should hopefully allow you to play the game without any issues. Thanks steinman17 for the feedback!

I've gotten great at talking myself down whenever I feel the telltale signs, racing heart, dry mouth, upset stomach.

I am so worried about the stress this will cause that my fear is actually CAUSING the stress I'm scared of.

We talked for a bit. Bottom line, considering some history of mental issues on my mother's side, she decided to schedule me an appointment in April with a psychiatrist to see about anxiety meds.

Mind wouldn't stop racing, thoughts would terrorize me, my body would be all fight-or-flight. Paranoia, stress, stomach butterflies, dreading things, what not.   Thankfully I don't get them anymore, the ONLY thing absent in my life is tea (also coffee). 

I don't know about you, but I never knew how badly tea used to trigger anxiety in me until I quit it. It took me a few weeks probably to completely quit it as I used to drink at least two cups every day. Now, even when I have a cup of tea, there is an immediate, noticeable spike in anxiety that I can feel. The good thing is, now I know that the anxiety is not my own but an effect of the tea. Still, I try to avoid it more or less (unless I am having a cold, where a bit of tea works well for unclogging the sinus). I would tell you this, try to slowly go off the wagon of tea and coffee (I quit coffee as well, but let me assure you, it takes time to quit these things, a couple of months is nothing here because how deeply we are used to drinking the coffee and tea). Getting rid of tea got rid of 90% of my anxiety. Of course dealing with the situations which gave me anxiety, coping with them in a better way also helped, but tea was a major player in the ""triggering"" phase of anxiety. Without it, it takes much more stress and strain for me to get anxious. Which is good, isn't it? :)

1123,Health anxiety sufferers - has the internet worsened our condition?,"This is a discussion I would like peoples opinion on. More and more lately, i'm waking up to the fact that the internet has completely screwed me up in terms of all the anxieties and worries I feel. 

Maybe I was pre-disposed to be a person who worries about their health but there is no doubt in my mind that the internet has made it 1000x as bad. For example, recently I've contracted a chest infection after a cold. I done a bit of googling and seen something called myocarditis which can cause sudden death. I read about it for a few hours and have completely freaked myself out for the last 5 days and been in a constant state of panic. Thinking I'll die at any second. I'm not sure any of you have had the fear of sudden death before but it's very scary.

Without the internet I wouldn't even know such a condition exists. Without the internet maybe I'd go to the doctor more frequently than I should. But my knowledge about the existence of certain conditions would be nowhere near what it is now and thus I'd worry so much less. I recognize the importance of the internet in society, but sometimes I wish it never came into existence. Life would be so much simpler. I couldn't google my every symptom. I couldn't read up on sudden death and convince myself it will happen to me. 

Some of you might say get rid of the internet but it's not that simple. The internet is ubiquitous in society. Just wondering what are peoples thoughts on this? Stopping googling is something which could obviously help but any HA sufferer knows it's not that simple to stop googling stuff. Even when not looking for something about a symptom sometimes I'll read a story about a young person dying suddenly and then freak myself out. It's such a vicious circle.

1130,Finally asked for help,"I am a 23 year old guy who has been suffering from anxiety ever since my early teens. I have only once or twice mentioned my anxiety to my parents, but they never believed me and thought I was just over exaggerating. I never mentioned it to anyone else and I just kept it bottled up inside me.

The thing is, my anxiety has been a huge rollercoaster in my life. I could go for months of feeling great, with no anxiety at all. Then other times I could take a nosedive and feel miserable for months. There were points in my life where I thought I had finally conquered my anxiety, only for it to resurface again.

Last night I was rolling around in my bed, unable to sleep due to worrying about upcoming things, past memories, things that don't even make sense to dread about, etc. I suddenly realized that I had not felt good for nearly a half a year. I literally started to panic and this is the first time in my anxiety that I felt like I was trapped with no escape. After hours of rolling around, I finally managed to get a 2-3 hour sleep before my alarm clock rang.

Immediately at work I looked up a phone number for my local psychiatrist. I made the call. I was getting ready for someone to pick up the phone who is completely uninterested and would basically think ""great, another weirdo"". How wrong I was. The lady who answered was instantly calming and telling me that I did the right thing to reach out. She started asking me questions about my anxiety, asking about medical history, etc. She told me that they would evaluate my case and would contact later this week for a visit at the clinic. She told me I could call the same number if I started to feel really bad and needed help immediately.

For the first time in my life, I felt like someone finally understood. It felt like someone reached out for me in the darkness and finally grabbed my hand.

I'm done with my anxiety. It's time to get rid of this thing. Wish me luck guys.",12,2014-11-24 16:48:08 EST-0500

1139,"Just subscribed, here's why.","So I'm new here. I can just speak my mind and say what I have to right? I really need to talk to someone,anyone. Even if only 1 person reads this, I will feel better.

So I've had huge problems with anxiety in the past. I got over it for the last half of high school and never had issues. But here I am, on vacation in Florida visiting my grand for Thanksgiving and all I am looking forward to is night time so I can cry alone in my room without being seen or disturbed. I'm sorry I'll just get to what's bothering me now:

There's a girl. This girl and I have a real connection, we've kissed and people on the outside would assume that she's my girlfriend and that I'm her boyfriend. That is what I want. However for personal reasons, she is hesitant about committing fully to a relationship. I was fine with waiting for things to happen naturally cause I don't want to rush anything. But we hangout and cuddle and kiss. It's just all without the commitment and the label of relationship. Why am I anxious then?

I have had a few bad, horrible experiences with girls in the past. I always end up being hurt and I always get dealt the bad hand when it's all over. So when this girl can't commit, I feel like she's kinda leaving me on hold. You know like I'm just a side that she enjoys and can easily be dropped should something better come along. She's the sweetest girl and I don't think she would do that but of course my anxiety makes me think like this. So while I'm away on vacation I won't be seeing her for a while, whatever. But when I hear she's hanging out with her ex boyfriend (one of her best friends) I'm sure you can imagine the anxiety I have. I don't want to be hurt again, I don't want to be just a thrill on the side. I'm so terrified that at this moment she is off with somebody else. I don't know what to do. Happy Thanksgiving everybody.

1147,I want to live someday.,"31 and I want to die, but I'm not going to kill myself. Not a chance. I realize that I don't really want to die. I want the feelings that keep me from happiness to die. Also, when I really want to die, I have maybe one or two memories I focus on and hang on to that for a while.

Every aspect of my personality confuses me. Who am I? I hate that question. I am all things. I am nothing. I have no core. I am fluid. I am contradiction. Human behavior and emotion confuses me. Clearly I'm overthinking. But if overthinking is my natural state, how do I learn to use it to power happiness.

Too many thoughts. Where is the peace?

When I was younger, I could talk. I could joke. If people disagreed, I didn't care so much. I had a point of view. I can't communicate anymore. All my life, I thought I'd end up being a writer. I wrote a short story in third grade before stupid soccer practice. Ever since, I tell myself ""go be a writer."" What a fucking curse.

I write nearly every day, but am unable to communicate to human beings when they are near me. Or so it feels that way. I never finish things. I get bored easily and new ideas comes along. My mind is a crowded place, mostly full of regret, shame and self-loathing. It's like a train car on a morning commute, full and fast. It's like an unruly classroom with a substitute teacher, no control.

I think there aren't enough people in my life. I have no friends. I have no lovers. Lovers are wonderful complications I can take or leave. But no friends? Jeez, they are so good at distracting me from my bullshit. I miss having friends.

I have a few family members 2,200 miles away. I have a girlfriend 2,200 miles away as well. We barely speak. And when we do, it's not fulfilling. She's no girlfriend I want. I want to break up with her. I've never treated her very well, before or after I moved across the country a few months ago. She's too stupid to break up with me. 

I've broken up with her a few times over the past few years. I can't do it now because I don't want to cause her pain. Would it cause her pain? Yes, in the short term. Maybe very short term. Maybe no pain at all. No, it will cause pain. If breaking up with her would cause her no pain, she would have already broken up with me because I am mean. I don't have the balls to officially end it. And she still has my couch and some other things of mine. It's a nice couch. Would she burn the couch and my other things? Who needs to be in a relationship with someone who thinks you are stupid? I've told her I think she's an idiot. She still doesn't break up with me. She visits me for a week. How nice. We don't even kiss or hold hands. Why? I'll tell you why. Because I don't make the move to kiss or hold hands. Because I don't want to. She still doesn't break up with me. I guess she's just as fucking stupid and broken as I am. I hate her for not knowing what's best for her. She should break up with me and find someone who wants to get married and have children. I don't want those things and I've told her multiple times.

I have major amounts of stress and anxiety. I feel clumsy. I feel like I can't speak, like I don't have access to my intelligence anymore. Does this lead to depression? To me, depression is not the issue. I have fleeting moments of joy (a book or hike or TV show or video game or meal or podcast, see there are plenty things I like). 

Every now and then I drink alcohol to experience relief. I don't know when to stop drinking, so I don't do it as much as I used to. And the tiny amount of control over my thoughts is wiped out the next day, so it's my plan to not drink at all anymore. I'd say I drink about once a week, when I know I don't have to work the next day so I can be hungover and isolate myself from the world.

Don't have money or time to find a decent therapist. Have tried multiple times, but they all say go somewhere else, even the ones with sliding scale or college clinics are full, wtf? Feels like Universe is telling me to fix myself. I'd rather do it myself anyway.

I eat healthier now. I gave up caffeine. I drink caffeine-free hot tea. Passionflower. I take L-theanine. I hike. I joined a gym. It keeps getting worse. It is a storm of the mind. Is it a cycle? That would be the worst. To be on a constant cycle of barely getting better, but always regressing to the bad place. I want to be getting stronger. But that isn't life is it? We suffer. We deteriorate. We break apart. Entropy.

I have no religion. I don't believe in fate or that things happen for a reason. I believe all is chaos. We define our own meaning and order. I have no self-created system of order. It's my hope that all this is making me stronger. But I keep emerging from each chrysalis and still I'm a god damn caterpillar. I feel worse everyday. 

The more unhealthy things I eliminate from my life, the less I have to blame for this unhappiness. I am uncomfortable with all things physical, mental and spiritual. I have no peace. I have a little hope. I hope one day I am happy. I hope one day it clicks and I ""get it."" Get what? I have no clue. I have irrational fears that everyone knows something I don't know. A secret to life. 

I did a lot of drugs one year in high school. Ecstasy and LSD and I think it fucked my brain. Every experience was awful and traumatic but I kept doing it because every one around me was doing it. I blame the paranoia and mood swings and obsessive circular thinking and disconnectedness on that. I also blame my parents. Mother is full of anxiety and mood swings and drinks too much, but she's highly functioning, and as far as I can tell the alcohol is her one indulgence/vice. Father is an addict of pain meds, already had open heart surgery, can't eat healthy, probably bipolar. I stopped talking to Father this year, such is his madness. He's never lived close. Somewhere in boonies deep South currently. He left me a voicemail the other day. He said because I have crazy genes from Mother and Father it's only going to get worse as I age. I know he's crazy. I know he's wrong. However, with the state I'm in, I can't rule such a statement out completely.

I don't understand why I have no friends. I had many friends in the past. Why do friends lose touch? Long live transience, I say, but it's hard to live by. I want people to like me and  I want to not give a fuck when they don't like me.

I have a sneaking suspicion I'm a bit co-dependent. I've had a couple long-term shitty relationships that have band-aided true self growth. But I don't think I'll ever find myself. I don't even understand what that means. I don't understand much. I thought I was smart. Now I'm older, I know nothing. 

I try to project love. Except to bad girlfriend. I'm mean to her. But she persistently clings onto the nothingness I offer. 

I feel no love in return. I feel no one is interested in me. I don't blame them. I'm not interesting right now. 

I'm not able to speak or make jokes or relate. I just want to be agreeable. I want to make and have good company. 

Even if I have to work a minimum wage job for the rest of my life, I want to feel content. What is the path? How do I eliminate desire and expectation without releasing ambition?

Is there a purpose to my suffering? Are some people meant to be alone? Good god I see plenty of people who are 
alone. Are some of you loners happy? I'm sure not. 

It's a privileged sort of suffering if you put it in perspective to the suffering of millions of others around the world. But for me I'm at my lowest or near lowest. I've been thrown up and down. I've been set on fire and I've been nearly drowned. I've felt plenty of pain, but none like the kind that nests deep inside my mind. I'm not sure if I'm falling deeper into suffering or climbing out of some pit. I don't know up from down. I have nothing to offer the world. No advice. I wish I did. I am Salieri from another Universe and this Universe is Mozart.

I had a decent job that was going nowhere. It was killing my soul. It was in marketing. I wanted to be an artist, a writer, so I moved to Hollywood. I thought I could work in TV. Why? TV raised me. I wanted to participate. Now, I'm here and I don't care about writing as much. But I keep writing. I knew it wouldn't be easy. But I'm not living life. I'm not happy. I can't be passionate about writing until I'm happy.

I want to live someday.",5,2014-11-24 03:06:32 EST-0500

1149,Guys what the heck is this?,"Am I having anxiety attacks? Is this what anxiety is?
I cant go into too much detail because I'm at work, but I just really want to talk about it.

I'm a male, 21, about to be 22, and otherwise very healthy.
Last thursday, on my way to work, I was feeling a little uneasy in the car, like anxious. Thursdays are my favorite day because I have class the next day and I don't have to be at work again till monday, so I tend to get a bit excited that my weekend is starting. Anyway, in the car I felt my heart racing a little more than usual, slightly harder to breathe but really nothing to unusual. I'm at work and everything seems fine. about an hour after I get to work I am reading something on the computer and I suddenly feel like I am just going to faint right there, I get really dizzy and feel out of control. My heart starts racing and my chest feels tight. My heart rate is really high. I get really scared, so I go outside to walk and breathe, but it's just not going away! Within the hour about 2 more times I feel like I'm losing consciousness. I get really frightened and I think I'm having a heart attack, so I google the symptoms and as I'm reading these symptoms I just get more and more scared. Making it worse. I sent my mom a message on skype saying I thought I was having a heart attack. She heard my symptoms and told me it's probably just an anxiety attack.

Anywho, the dizzyness goes away after about an hour, and I start to calm down, but my heart rate stays up. And this very uneasy feeling in me.
(I should also say, I had a couple of very slight sips of pre-workout in the morning. Very small sips. I am used to taking caffeine and energy drinks. I dont know if maybe this set it off? But what is funny is this last week and a half maybe? I have been consuming less caffeine than I have in a long time). 

Well, since Thursday I have had this constant, uneasy feeling in my chest, like scared and stressed that I am going to have an anxiety attack. It mostly starts about an hour after I wake up. And goes throughout the day till I am exercising or something. 

Lately I have noticed I have been obsessing like crazy over stuff. Like having to have everything around me perfectly clean. I want to time myself for everything I do. I want to plan everything I am going to do. I want to know how long I am taking for everything I am doing. Like I need a constant flow of information.  I don't know, Its fucking weird. I cant describe it.

I go to the gym every single day. I run a lot. I play adult league soccer. I go rock climbing. I have hobbies. 

I have been trying to breathe deep, but it seems like the shortness of breath doesnt go away.
I checked my pulse right now. I am at about 80bpm but I still have this feeling of an anxious, fast beating heart.

I also sometimes get realllllly depressed. Like just wanting to go to sleep and never wake up. Which for the past couple months I haven't noticed very much , but since thursday i've started to feel like shit again.

Anyway, wish I could give you more detail. Sorry I'm kind of all over the place. Just needed to vent.

Is this anxiety? Or asthma or something else?

1154,I (21M) have a form of GAD where I get a lot of bizarre intrusive thoughts that encourage me to make my life harder than it already is just to prove I'm not as weak as my mind will make me believe. Please help,"First off I'm waiting on CBT to deal with this, so far counselling has helped this to an extent but the thoughts keep coming. 

I get something similar to OCD-type 'intrusive thoughts'. They often go hand in hand with the stigma. 

One of my great self-pereptuating problems is believing that having this condition is not as an excuse to feel/display its symptoms or behaviours, and that I 'should' function just like everybody else. Essentially I call myself weak, lazy, needy etc. a lot for how I feel, I am not always very kind to myself. I take mottos such as 'sleep is for the weak' and 'no pain no gain' literally. Most of the time it has been one of my tutors who recommended me to go get an extension or appeal for mitigating circumstances in University, I always said ""my problem's not that bad/it's kind of my fault, I don't deserve this"" etc.  My ideal role model is Superman, so it's a little lofty. 

An extended example of these thoughts: 

-> Anxiety sometimes makes it harder for me to get enough sleep; either I can't get to sleep, I wake up early or I wake up but don't feel rested. A part of me thinks that my family/boss *wants* me to be this way, just like any adult, because at least I'm not lazy. So it is in fact good to be sleep deprived and not do anything about it or complain, it is a sign of stoicism. However sleep deprivation is not an excuse for being late, slow to do something/in conversation, make a mistake etc. I 'should have tried harder'. 

-> Hand in hand with this, I try to keep reasonably fit although panic attacks have killed my confidence exercising, as cardio has similar symptoms. I still get about and sometimes make it to the gym, but I feel bad about this. My family/friends/colleagues etc. don't need to go the gym to reduce stress, so I shouldn't have to, it is 'weak' of me to do so. In a weird way it is 'lazy' because the non-lazy thing to do would be to carry on working through exhaustion and burn-out. But because everybody is supposed to exercise, it is 'lazy' to *not* go, so I am lazy anyway.  

-> Because it is 'lazy and weak' to need to lead a healthy lifestyle for stress management and confidence, I should also not need erections to have confidence sexually. It is good if I can't get it up and have low testosterone, and I'm sleepy weak tired stressed and out of shape all the time. But it's my fault if I am so tired I get ran over or feel sick, which has happened before today when symptoms are bad.    

->However if I am unfit, impotent/struggle to get it up, or sleepy, that is a good enough reason to get rejected on dates, dumped or cheated on. My girlfriend should expect me to be in great shape and never tired or stressed, never complaining about it if I am, so if I am these things I deserve to get dumped. However I am a terrible lazy son and employee if I am not impotent.  

-> So basically, I have to be sleepy and impotent because it shows I am a hard worker, and also not go to the doctor's or anything about it because it shows I'm strong, but I also have to never be sleepy and be able to perform really well and be amazing shape at the same time, or I deserve to get abused by my girlfriends. I will inevitably have to choose whether I will be a good son/employee or lover and either way I have failed and need to be punished. 

-> Sometimes I will also binge eat and have considered making myself drink on the way to work then telling myself I deserve to get dumped for putting on the weight and not taking care of my gf's sexual needs as well as being a irresponsible employee for drinking before work. 

This is just one example of the intrusive thoughts going through my head. It leads to scenarios where I end up staying up late to ensure I don't get enough sleep for work/lectures the next day and berating myself for getting there late feeling ill and tired while also deliberately fucking up my date by being late and too tired to say much while doing what I can to encourage my date to leave.  

Essentially there is a part of me which takes sick pleasure in obsessively setting myself impossible/draconian 'goals' that will make myself ill tired and unhappy just to prove my own fortitude or lack thereof so that it can chastise me for my weakness and cowardice if I am unable to function like everyone else. I will then be telling myself angrily to 'man up' 'get over it' and so forth. 

If I *don't* follow through with these thoughts I feel quite anxious and guilty, like I am letting people down for not simultaneously having a high and low sex drive, big and small penis, exhausted and energised, etc. 

The easiest way to explain this is that I have been known to consider my anxiety not as a disability but almost as an unfair advantage (?), and then taken steps to drag myself down so that I have to deal with 'real problems'. This is despite the fact that the Learning Teaching Support Officer at Uni kept insisting that I actually *have* a disability and am either in denial (which is unlikely considering how much I utilised the counselling service) or partially blame myself for my mental illness. 

*What I am doing is, I realise, being given a walking stick for a bad leg I lost use of in a horrible car accident, only to tell myself that if I were stronger I would have been able to pick up the car and throw it off me, throwing the stick away in anger at myself for abusing the state and then pouring acid on my leg instead, just to see if I am so weak that I will complain about the burn-and also berating myself for being unable to run a mile with my PTSD-inducing acid-drenched broken leg.*

*tl;dr* In short I am horrendously self-stigmatising of my anxiety disorder.  

The thoughts I have are *incredibly* stupid because they are physically impossible goals to achieve at the same time, but in line with Superman and the 'alpha male', fearless and free of insecurity and need, I expect myself to at least try to overcome these and function on the same level as any other individual without my problem. I am a perfectionist who believes in self-improvement and have very high standards for myself, or did, I have somewhat scared myself out of anything now. 

How the hell I can think so stupidly, and act so stupidly, and still graduate from Uni I have *no* clue but hey I did!

I already had social anxiety, occasional bouts of insomnia and panic attacks, so these thoughts are really unhelpful. I mean really, it is bad enough when you have mild insomnia, it's completely unnecessary to *encourage* your mind to be that way and criticise yourself for not being that way. 

There is a simple reason for why I am so critical of my 'illness': I live in the First World, I'm by no means rich but live far from poverty, I have food shelter access to clean water, I have loving and supportive family (yes) and friends (mostly?) I am in good health generally, it's not like I NEVER SLEEP, nor is it like I have cancer or had a heart attack or my friend has died. The only really 'tragic' things I've had in my life are my parents divorcing when I was 16, developing panic attacks and the GAD diagnosis at 18 and GAD basically causing a breakup with my first serious partner this year. It's not like I'm in a war-zone. 

Before anybody asks I am not a troll, I have had a former Reddit account and people believe from the threads on that that I am psychologically disturbed beyond GAD. I don't know I'm waiting for CBT for that, I might have OCD after all.

Has anyone ever had to deal with thoughts like this or similar things? Thanks

1156,Had an epiphany about anxiety that may help some of you.,"I've had anxiety/depression as long as I can remember, and somewhere along the way I learned to force myself to stay ""positive"". I spent an entire decade trying to fix myself, coming up with a new solution every week. Notes to myself, inspirational things, cognitive behavioral therapy, etc. I stayed positive, and I never gave up on trying to fix myself.

I don't remember exactly how it happened, but about a month ago I realized the ""I need to fix myself"" mindset was the problem. I had never realized that these ""positive"" thoughts were messing me up. 

I had tried CBT in the past, but I had never seen these thoughts as negative. I never really had any seriously negative thoughts, which confused me, because I was very depressed/anxious.

Once I applied CBT to these ""fix myself"" thoughts and identified them as damaging, things have gotten a lot better for me. I was being too hard on myself without realizing it, and that's what was creating my anxiety.

Edit: It turns out I can still work on self-improvement in this mindset. I just ask myself if I actually **want** to do it, and if it will make me happy. Turns out I actually enjoy running/eating healthy/etc.

1157,Pervasive sadness and anger over childhood years lost to anxiety/depression,"I was diagnosed in February of this year after a very severe panic attack that occurred at work.

I had a good home life compared to many people on this forum.  The only problem was, my baby sibling was diagnosed with cancer and as anyone who has witnessed the effects of childhood cancer on a family knows, it can tear a family apart if not dealt with.  And it wasn't.  There were no counsellors or therapists to talk to me and my other siblings (I was the oldest) about what was happening.  No family meetings to discuss the treatment and what my parents needed to do in order to get that treatment.  My parents are not bad people, not by any stretch, but failing to provide guidance to us was a terrible mistake.

My family became very separate.  We didn't do much together and when we did, it was marred by my father's explosive, terrifying anger and my mother's stress, empty threats/promises, guilt trips.  Family trips were torturous and full of anger and boredom.  I spent 8+ hours on the computer a day, even more in the summer and weekends.  On computer binges, I wouldn't shower, would hold my bladder until it was ready to burst (jesus christ - that detail JUST came back to me and is probably partly responsible for my bladder problems now!), would only eat things that were instant if I ate anything at all, keep myself awake by burning the soles of my feet on the radiator...  

I started a highly ritualized self-harm habit that became my closest guarded secret when I was about 12.  I DID reach out in misguided ways - I told a friend my age about my self harm and a couple weeks later she told me she started doing it too.  I cut contact with her out of shame and guilt and fear that I would fuck her up even more.  I felt wholly responsible.  My mom found my knife in my drawer one day and confronted me.  I denied and I honestly can't remember how I got her to drop the subject - I know for sure, however, that she knew undeniably that I was cutting myself.  I remember telling her that I felt sad one day and she snapped at me to shut up because she had it so much worse as a kid.  I have always struggled with the idea that my feelings are ""real"" and ""valid"". I One day, I had what I now know was an anxiety attack, but I just thought I was going crazy or I was just being hysterical.  I called the kidshelpphone and they urged me to talk to my mom about seeing a counsellor.  I was comforted by that hotline and felt resolved to get help and felt that I really needed it because these were not normal and I wasn't just being ""too emotional"".

I told my mom.  We had a long talk and she said she was going to get me help.  We went to the hospital some weeks later and I got blood work done to check for hormonal imbalances.  She snapped at me while I cried in the waiting room, saying my sibling had to get hundreds of needles all over his body for the cancer treatment and this was nothing.  I was/am afraid of needles (not nearly as bad any more) and that's why I was crying.  Plus, I was really afraid of finding out I was going to be fucked up forever and feel like that forever because of some illness.  I had no clue about mental illness.  Depression was a synonym for sad to me.  Anxious meant ""excited, can't wait"".  Weeks went by and I was never told of the results and I was too terrified to ask so it just faded into the background again.  She found my cutting tools once mroe after that and again, I don't remember how I got her to drop it, but it didn't go anywhere.  I hid them much better from that point on and they were never discovered again (I threw them out years ago, thank god).

She and I have a much better relationship now, though it's a little strained at the moment.  Recently when we were chatting on the phone, I made a comment like ""I'm glad I'm finally dealing with these problems that are almost a decade old!""  and she said something to the effect of, ""Oh yes, by the way I'm sorry we never got you into counselling.  I tried but there was no way to do it.""  I had to end the conversation because I felt ill suddenly.  Now that I know of the resources around me... I know she lied.  I know she was too consumed with my sibling's cancer and I don't blame her for that - I can't fucking imagine going through that!  My dad was a horrible support for her at the time too.   But it just really winded me to realize that I DIDN'T have to have all these scars, physical and mental, because she SHOULD have gotten me help.  I was cutting myself and she saw them!!  She saw undeniable proof and she chose to not help me.  She didn't protect me.  And it hurts knowing I lost almost ten years of my life to these ailments...

I know it's not her fault.  It's just very hard to... just deal with this loss.  I'm grieving.  And I thank you, whoever is reading this.  This has been a good exercise to get these feelings out.

Thank you.  I'm here for anyone who would like to chat.  I'm in a much better place now.",5,2014-08-03 23:38:24 EDT-0400
1158,"Overthinking Situations, Paranoia, Racing Mind","I was wondering if many other anxiety suffers experience this and what they do to help it. 

I always find myself ""overthinking"" any type of situation, creating unnecessary stress and anxiety. I find myself asking ""What if...?"" all the time regarding any situation, big or little. Many times I end up avoiding the situation all together, which later can lead to depression.

This happens with basically every situation. I always think the outcome will be the worst possible. I have anxiety and a general ""racing mind"" every minute of the day, it's a never ending process and it really hinders my daily life. ",23,2014-08-02 23:59:53 EDT-0400
1159,I hope this helps you at least a litttle :),"Well im off camping deep into the mountains for 4 days. Im putting this to help me and hopefully help some of you. Its from one of my favorite anxiety sites. Happy Weekend to all!

Many people ask me what they should do to eliminate their anxiety or how do I get rid of this particular symptom? I was one of those people who went over and over things, trying to find a solution to the way I felt, constantly trying to stop myself feeling this way. Well that was my mistake, I was ‘Trying not to feel a certain way’. One thing that I learnt very quickly is that “Trying to rid ourselves of anxiety only increases it”. Yet this is what most people attempt to do and just end up more entrenched in the habit. I say the opposite and tell people to feel it, to go towards it, do nothing to try to get rid of it. People develop safety behaviours and avoidance techniques that can severely restrict their lives because they don’t want to feel it. How can this be the way forward? The truth is that it is not, I only turned my life around when I finally accepted that I had anxiety and it was not going to go over night, I shook it by the hand and said “If you are going to be around for a while then we may as well get along”.

To recover from anxiety we have to be willing to feel it and that’s means taking it with us wherever we go. Yes for a while we will still feel anxious, we may still feel detached or have anxious thoughts hanging around, that’s fine and only to be expected. We also have to be willing to feel it for a while, not a day or a week, but as long as it takes. I have people email me and say some lovely things about the book after reading it, but I had one a few weeks ago saying ” Paul I have just finished your book, but I am not cured”. I am struggling to understand which book she read as it says nothing about getting to the end and a magic wand comes down and cures you. This is the sort of person that will be off next week to try another miracle cure hoping that it will instantly go away, she has no intention of feeling anxiety for a minute longer.

The more desperate you look for recovery, the further away it can seem as you are putting so much pressure on yourself to feel better and making it your whole life. Why not just step back and do nothing, whilst getting on with your life as you normally would, this will do you far more good long term. I am not trying to make it sound easy, it is not at times and I used to want to hide away at home and shut out the world, but I refused to as I wanted to be part of that world again. Just so there is no confusion, when I talk about doing nothing, I mean no longer trying to fix or figure it all out, not doing nothing by sitting at home looking at the ceiling. Go out and live your life, uncomfortable or not, take all your insecurities with you and feel it all at will. You don’t have to wait until anxiety leaves you to have a life, you can have one now. If you want to be part of the outside world again then go and join it, don’t let how you feel stop you.

The constant stress and battle to feel better is what kept me in the cycle, it consumed me and my day. So just try not to become one of those people. I know we feel like we must keep on top of things, to get the better of this thing, but it has the opposite effect. One of calmest and most together people on the planet are Buddist monks and their whole belief is to just be, to not over think or worry about things. Since my own recovery I have a new outlook on life and don’t worry about trival things or things I can’t control. I am also a far more forgiving and laid back person and it is what I learnt through my own recovery. -Paul David",6,2014-08-07 19:37:17 EDT-0400

Maybe I just need to avoid /r/worldnews ? It seems like anything about climate change, disease, war, or some other event is occupying my mind constantly.

EDIT: Thanks everyone for your advice. I'm already considered a person with anxiety (thus meds), but I made the mistake and read news and worldnews while on vacation last week and it ruined a part of it until you good folk brought me to my senses!",22,2014-08-03 15:44:37 EDT-0400

1162,"I feel like my anxiety isn't as intense as others' and I should just ""get over it"". [Rant?]","My heart beats so hard and fast at the smallest hint of possible drama or intense conversation.  I had to leave my room mate a note asking about her move out plans and every time I think about it my stomach feels like it's filled with acid and my heart beats so hard that I can almost hear it in my ears.

If something is out of place, or done ""incorrectly"" by the room mates I get anxious when I hear my boyfriend come home because he is going to be annoyed by it. (My boyfriend is really wonderful, it's all me being over dramatic. Ugh, that still sounds like he is a bad guy. He isn't I swear).

I get anxious whenever I get a text. Whenever my phone rings. Whenever I have to meet new people.

I even got dressed up for a costume party other night. My boyfriend drove us all the way across town. We got there and I saw some people weren't as dressed up as me so I panicked and we didn't go in and we just went home. 

I don't really know what the point of this post is. I looked up symptoms of anxiety and I feel like my symptoms are different. Do I even have anxiety? 

Ever since I can remember, speaking in front of people, or to people about an issue I have causes my heart beat to be super intense and I can't stop shaking. Whenever I have to have a ""serious"" conversation, I shake like I am cold. 

I'm really good at faking confidence sometimes, but as soon as I am alone, it all falls apart.

I even get shaky and worked up about minor driving confrontations, like if someone is tailgating me, or honks at me, ugh I can't stand it. 

I just needed to vent I guess. My room mate and I aren't speaking cause she asked for space, I guess I pushed her too hard. She isn't very grown up and I guess I threw too much grown-up life at her. Every day going home is awful. My stomach turns over and over and I just rush to my room. 

Thankfully our lease is up this month. ",22,2014-08-06 22:50:08 EDT-0400
1163,[Help] Finding a job for my teenage self that won't make my anxiety go through the roof?,"Hello, everyone. I'm a 16 year old heading into my senior year of high school in 2 weeks. I really should have a job. I should have some sort of income to save for college, maybe a car (if I ever get my license, but that's a whole other anxiety issue, one at a time), or just for disposable income to go to the movies and what not. My friends all have jobs and whenever we go out they absolutely insist on buying me food if we go out to eat and paying for me at other places such as the movies. I hate it and it makes me feel terrible. I constantly tell them not to but they still do it. It makes me feel pathetic that I'm the only one without money all the time because I don't have a job like they do. They have jobs or volunteer, drive, have bank accounts. I don't have any of that because anxiety restricts me from everything. I know this sounds like a typical case of trying to grow up too fast, but it's really not. These are kind of normal things at this stage in someones life. And I'm not doing ANY of them or even making an effort to do any of them because of anxiety. 

I literally (and I don't use that word hyperbolically) have not done a single productive thing this summer. I haven't visited colleges, tried to get a job or internship or volunteer, gotten my permit, etc. I sleep til around 12pm through 2pm, then just go on the computer or play 3DS or watch Netflix all day. Almost every single day of summer has consisted of just that. My moods and energy levels are all over the place. I fear for my future everyday and thoroughly believe I will end up homeless because I'm just too afraid to do anything. This is my last year of high school. After that, then what? What the fuck do I do?

The problem is that the jobs available to people of my age are mainly retail jobs, like a cashier or some sort of customer service. I do NOT want that at all. I could go on and on listing my irrational fears, but some of them include completely forgetting how to give change or do simple arithmetic even though the fucking cash register tells you how much to give because of the anxiety I'll experience of a person waiting on me to give them change and then having them yell at me, not knowing the answer to customers' questions and basically customer/human interaction in general, turning red (I have a huge fear of this and to help that I'm the palest person on the face of the earth) or just completely making a fool of myself during a job interview or on the job.

One of my biggest fears is seeing people I know in public. This has now become a HUGE problem for me because I've started see people I recognize from school fucking EVERYWHERE working at places I go to. It's especially terrible because these aren't people I talk to. I'm not friends with them. I'll just happen to know their name and they'll know me because I had a class with them or something. I couldn't even imagine working alongside one of them.

So I guess what I'm asking is are there any jobs I could get at my age that involve very minimal human interaction? Maybe accept online applications too? I would LOVE a job where I just clean tables or wash dishes. I can totally handle that. And I mean, that seems to be a pretty common job, right? The whole busboy gig. Just washing dishes/cleaning tables. I see people at restaurants doing it all the time. But I'm afraid that if I apply to a restaurant and start doing that they might want to promote me to cashier or something else at some point.

Well this was a hell of a lot longer than I wanted it to be. Sorry about that. It's really hard for me to make anything short, especially on this subject.

I'm trying so hard to fight this and not let it run my life, but it's just so extremely difficult. I've been feeling very suicidal for a while now. It's beating me right now. It's winning.

EDIT: Wow. I stopped checking this post last night and then fell asleep thinking that it was just gonna get buried. Then I wake up to a bunch of thoughtful comments. I did not expect this at all. Thank you all so much. I'm reading every single one of them.",31,2014-08-07 06:30:03 EDT-0400

1165,My fear of going crazy/becoming psychotic is actually bordering on psychotic. How do you deal?,"It feels as if I'm always on the cusp of falling into psychosis. I have depersonalization and PTSD from a bad trip and these have triggered an irrational and obsessive fear of going crazy. No matter how much I tell myself that crazy people don't know it, the obsession persists. Ironically though, the high anxiety from this fear is kind of pushing me over the edge. My thinking has become scattered and black and white and my memory is disappearing which only reinforces my fear that may be becoming a reality.

1170,I think I have ergophobia (fear of work),"I have a severe case of GAD. I've lost all of my jobs because of it. I'm talking about part time jobs such as restaurants and stores since I'm still in school. I was fired from one due to it, let go from two others (they said costumers thought I was on drugs) and then quit the last three due to sudden and sever anxiety. The last time it got so bad that I couldn't even enter the workplace to tell my boss I had to quit, so my mom had to do it for me. I'm 20, so that's really embarrassing.
 I've feared work for some time now, but now it has gotten so bad that I'm unable to sign up for any jobs at all. Almost anything makes me really anxious. I have started crying while looking for a job or sending in applications. I have no money now, what so ever... Can anyone relate? Do you think it's ergophobia?",8,2014-08-03 20:59:55 EDT-0400
1171,My boyfriend has an anxiety disorder - how can I help?,"My boyfriend has chronic anxiety that has recently become overwhelming for him. He doesn't believe that therapy will help him, and I'm not sure how to convince him otherwise. He has wonderful family and friends who are understanding, but they have also noticed changes -- suddenly lashing out at his family, friends and me over perceived criticism, exhaustion, constantly worried about his appearance, constantly worried about his performance... he is so sensitive, everything hurts. Nobody knows entirely what's going on, he says different things to everyone. I don't think he's slept over an hour each night for over two months. 

Holding him doesn't help. Telling him that I believe in him, that he's extremely capable and extremely smart and hilarious and handsome and that I'm here for him doesn't seem to mean anything to him, even though all of it is 100% true. He is going through a lot right now... New city, new job, etc. It's very stressful, but I worry that even if he finds a way to cope, the next stressful thing will set him off again. 

How do I help him? I just want him to be well. He's not taking medication for his anxiety, and as I said he doesn't believe in therapy. If anyone has advice for him, or me, I would be grateful. ",17,2014-08-02 10:51:04 EDT-0400

1175,"I made an Android game to stop panic attacks, want to help me test it?","Hey /r/Anxiety. I need some help testing something. I've had panic attacks since I was a little kid, but this last year they got really bad. I started to see a therapist, got some help, and started to learn how to deal with them. Most of the time, I work on prevention through heavy physical exercise, (running), meditation, and muscle relaxation exercises. I got prescribed some Xanax for when the panic attack happened. But here's the kicker:

I'm an [emetophobe](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emetophobia). I get panic attacks when I think I'm going to throw up. Since one symptom of panic attacks is nausea, it all just spirals into a cluster fuck of awful. Anyway, if my panic attack gets really bad, I can't bring myself to eat or swallow anything. So I am too afraid to take the pill that stops the panic. 

My solution to this has been video games. Since I don't have my computer with me all the time, I’ve been looking into phone apps that require excessive focus to take my mind off the panic attack. For the majority of the time, the app [Piano Tiles](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/piano-tiles-dont-tap-white/id848160327?mt=8) has worked really quite well. 

But I’m a programmer. I think I can do better. I want to create a game that is specifically for panic attack sufferers. That’s why I’ve been working on a game I call [Panic Pop](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.codeisscary.panicPop). 

Every little detail in the game is specifically designed to distract your brain. Don’t get me wrong, this is not a relaxation app. That sort of thing never worked for me while I was in a panic attack. This is something that’s goal is to get you into that state of mind where you can only think about one specific thing. That thing should not be your triggers or your fears. It should be the game.

The game works by having these little circles on the screen slowly get smaller until they disappear. If that happens, you lose. Games over, but you can restart immediately by pressing one button. This serves the purpose of stopping the player/panicker from setting the game down. There is no pause button while in game. You must continue to play. (and not think about whatever is triggering the panic attack) 

At the same time, you’re relatively free to pick your own pace at the start. Every time you tap a circle it disappears, and one or two more will appear, meaning that you can go as slow or as fast as you want provided you don’t let one of them shrink into nothingness. Meaning at the start, the game draws you in with a lot of freedom, and as the game draws on, it centers your focus. 

The game also has a very simple color pattern of greys, browns and soft yellows. It’s meant to be incredibly simple to pick up. There’s instructions, but you shouldn’t really need them. If you’re in the midst of a panic attack, you need the game NOW. Not after 5 minutes of reading instructions. 

Currently, the game is out. But, since I’m really just one dude with a small laptop and a kindle, I don’t really have the budget to really test it with other sufferers of panic attacks. 
That’s where you guys come in. I need you guys to test this thing out. Get it on your phones, and when you have a panic attack, try it. Tell me what you think. If it helps, great! If not, let’s try to figure out why it doesn’t and shoot me a PM. Or just reply to this thread. 

I will make changes to make damn sure it works. Panic attacks suck donkey balls. Let’s get better together Reddit.

EDIT: Wow, so this blew up a lot. Thank you everyone for your support and suggestions. The next update will feature new sounds (Probably [this one](https://www.freesound.org/people/junggle/sounds/30341/) and [this one](https://www.freesound.org/people/junggle/sounds/28826/)), hopefully with the option of changing between different ones. Thank you to /u/eudaimondaimon for showing me these! :) I'll also try to get an option that allows the user to change between different color palettes. I'm also going to try experimenting with the device on iPhone as well. If I can get something to run, I'll probably run a kickstarter/indiegogo for the money to publish it. If it succeeds, we'll hopefully see Panic Pop on iOS! 

For now, share the game with friends, especially those who have panic attacks. Rate the game on the Google Play store if you can, that helps it get more publicity, allowing it to help more people!

I'm not in danger or anything, I'm just kind of pondering life and everything. Like, I expect to have a grip on my mental health within the next ten years.

My period started super early and then decided to end after 2 days. So of course I went into a google vortex trying to figure out why. And of course the internet is determined to say I must be pregnant. Except I'm a lesbian so my girlfriend def has not gotten me pregnant. But in my anxiety spiral I decided that maybe my body just THOUGHT it was pregnant so maybe I should take a pregnancy test to be sure my body is not thinking it is pregnant even though it is not. The test obviously came back negative (both of them).

Anyways so I realized I had vanished of the face of the earth from my GF for a few days and I should let her know I am alive and she managed to respond to everything in the best ways possible. It's nice that she gets my anxiety.

1182,"""Be kind, for everyone you meet is fighting a hard battle."" - Pluto","Sorry for the random quote, but I wanted to share this one with you guys. This quote is so powerful in meaning, I think it has quickly vaulted itself up to one of my favorite quotes ever.

Personally, I am constantly wearing a facade. I usually have a smile on my face and appear to be in a good mood, but I could really be struggling inside. Often times I wake up before work and feel like the world is sitting firmly on my shoulders. I carry this feeling with me to work, but nobody really knows what is going on. They see a guy that appears happy at all times. What they don't know is that I have been living with anxiety for my entire life. The smile on my face is not real, at times. 

So, I know how I am as a person. There really isn't a need to be rude to people. It is not going to get you anything, and it could really have a negative impact on that person. I try my hardest to be kind to everyone because I know that I want everyone to be kind to me. Kindness breeds happy thoughts.

My other favorite one - 

>“First ask yourself: What is the worst that can happen? Then prepare to accept it. Then proceed to improve on the worst.”

- Dale Carnegie

I think both of these quotes can easily be applied to the nervous illness, otherwise known as anxiety.

Anybody have any other really awesome quotes to share?

EDIT: Plato, not Pluto - oops. I am hearing that the quote was not actually uttered by Plato, but, rather, Ian Maclaren.",11,2014-08-13 21:25:04 EDT-0400
1183,"After five years unemployed, I start a job this week. Thank you /r/anxiety!","So, it might sound silly, but somehow I developed a **phobia of jobs**. It was pretty intense. I couldn't fill out online forms without my heart racing and my whole body turning to stone. **People would hand me amazing opportunities, and I would come up with any reason in the world to not jump on it.**

I have no clue what triggered this anxiety. But it ruined my life. Overcoming it was a long, difficult road that started from the ground up.

In the past two years:

* I lost 100 pounds. /r/keto

* I quit porn and started /r/nofap.

* Understood my addiction to video games. /r/stopgaming

* I learned how to live in the present moment, instead of trying to relive the past or escape to the future. /r/meditation

* A month ago I started lifting, which has done amazing things for my confidence and mind, as well as my body. /r/ketogains

* And everytime I felt overwhelmed, I would ask this subreddit for advice. This especially helped, because I felt like I wasn't putting a burden on those close to me.

But even still, the only way I was able to break through, was with a lot of pain. One member of this subreddit suggested to me: **""Just keep doing it, even if it sucks, and eventually it'll suck less.""** And they were right. Repeat exposure helped me become non-outcome dependent. Panic attacks turned into something manageable. Rejections turned into ... Well, rejections, and they sucked, but they didn't destroy me.

For five years, five long years, I've tried to break this curse. And here we are. But this journey is faaar from over. This position is just a part-time retail position, and I have a bachelors degree that's collecting dust.

But one step at a time. When you start lifting, you gotta start with just the bar. I think this little job will help me grapple my social anxiety and allow me to start a new chapter.

So if you're out there, and you're in a similar position... And you feel cursed, broken, or just overwhelmed... Know you're not alone. **The path forward sucks, but take on the struggle, and keep coming back everytime it knocks you down.**

Thanks guys.",13,2014-08-10 18:11:00 EDT-0400

I'm currently in a psychiatric hospital, being treated for depression and anxiety. I don't know which lead to which, but they seem to go hand in hand. I'm taking Deanxit, and at night I get a drip with temesta and antidepressants. The anxiety is better, but sometimes I still get these panic attacks. Does this sound familiar to anyone here?

1188,Something That Helped Me: Don't Get Anxious About Being Anxious,"My anxiety sort of causes a downward spiral and I finally figured out why. I hate having anxiety, I hate the feeling of anxiety and I hate wondering if I'm doomed to always feel this way. So when something causes anxiety (for example: change) I get really anxious, and then I also got more anxious about the fact that I was feeling anxious. When I realized this, I was able to decrease my anxiety by at least cutting out the anxiety over anxiety. Now I can say to myself ""Hey, you're anxious right now because you're about to go back to college and you hate change. That's okay and I know this is something I'll feel in times of transition. No need to worry about the fact that I'm anxious. No need to think I'm just an innately anxious person. This is a trigger and there's no reason to worry about the fact that I'm experiencing anxiety""",7,2014-08-07 23:20:59 EDT-0400

1190,How do you deal with existential crises?,"For me, they come and go...but when they're here, they're all-consuming. I feel like it might be a summer thing, because I'm at this point where I'm just waiting for school to start so I have something to focus on besides my own thoughts. 

More recently, though, I think about the future. How I'm going to handle my parents dying. I am so scared of dealing with that and it's just...*inevitable*. I'm growing up, about to graduate, life is changing, and I'm almost an *adult*. It's exciting, but also terrifying. I just want to curl up into a corner and return to my childhood where it was easier to be carefree. 

However, one summer about ten years ago was when I had my first existential crisis. It all hit me at once that people *die*. It was then I became absolutely terrified of death and dealing with it. I'm just so afraid of being lost without my parents. I wouldn't say I'm overly dependent on them, I just really love them and I'm off at school living my own life and I feel so fucking guilty about it. I'm so afraid of the day everything will come crashing down that I'm just living in fear right now. On top of that, I have some kind of stomach sickness right now, so I'm stuck in my house feeling like shit.

I don't know, guys. When I think too hard about this stuff, I get panic attacks and they really scare me. I feel like there's no way for me to escape these emotions and they are slowly suffocating me. I just want to be happy, and I have no idea how. I feel like I need a mantra, something to tell myself to ground me when I think I'm about to explode...but these thoughts are just like a big black cloud over my head.

It seems like I've had these feelings inside me for ten years, they just come and go. I think as time passes and I have more of a ""life,"" they will subside, but they're still always there. How can I just accept life for what it is and learn to appreciate what I have?

This year has been a big one for me. I started therapy in January, and now have been diagnosed with ADHD and GAD. I'm on medication for the anxiety, and between the med and therapy, I've made huge strides. I feel like I really am taking hold of my life in a way I never have before. It's not that I'm doing anything fundamentally different... but the habits I've been trying to set all along are working, and my efforts are paying off. I've also lost 66 pounds (thanks keto!) and reconnected with distant family, as well as tried to re-immerse myself in creative pursuits that I abandoned when the anxiety was at its worst. This is my year of fixing and restoring things, and I'm kicking it in the pants!

1197,Guilt over cancelled plans/commitments.,"I'm hoping some of you can relate to this. My anxiety/hypochondria causes me to cancel plans on a semi-regular basis. Mostly it's plans with friends but occasionally it's meetings with a client (for my freelance job). I am mostly open about my anxiety but it makes me feel so weak to tell someone that I am cancelling because I'm having a particularly anxious day, and I am not open about it at all with my clients (I worry that it will make me seem incapable of being reliable -- too many people misunderstand anxiety disorders for me to be too open about it).

Ultimately I feel bad that 99% of the time I lie about why I'm rescheduling/cancelling. I try to keep my lie benign enough that they aren't worried about me, but still. I worry that karma is going to kick my ass for it, though I hope that karma is able to see why I'm doing it -- not out of malice, but out of self-preservation.

Anyways, can anyone relate to feeling like a shitbag for this?",12,2014-08-14 15:40:14 EDT-0400

Around my senior year in high school I began trying to look at it as a gift instead of a horrifying experience and I ended up inducing it to see how far I could go.
