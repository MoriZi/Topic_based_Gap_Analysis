2,Anyone else strangely calm in actual emergencies?,"I have social and generalized anxiety, and I usually jump to the absolute worst conclusions. (ex. if my mom is ten minutes late picking me up, she was in a wreck and died.) But lately 
i've noticed that when actually bad things happen, I'm suddenly calm and rational, generally that would be good, but it makes me feel emotionless. Like when my mom was in the hospital, I cried once. When her blood sugar drops, I kind of flatline and make her a sandwich, help her check it, etc. does anyone else experience this? I am taking buspirone, if that helps.

EDIT: obligatory ""wow this blew up!"" I'm glad a ton of other people experience this too, and I like hearing your stories! While I'm not sure I'd do as well as some of you in the crazy emergencies you've been in, I can only hope I would.",89,2016-01-02 02:24:49 EST-0500
3,"Fuck social anxiety, this is going to be the year I take my life back","TLDR; anxiety has caused my loneliness, body dismorphia disorder, depression and now suicidal thoughts

Over the last 3ish years social anxiety has been creeping up on me, and before I realized it, it was too late.  

From the outside, you'd think I'd be pretty content, I'm above average in looks (I think), my boss loves me and I do very well in school. I have a great family life, I live in the upper middle class and I'm in good health.

Unfortunately, my social life is absolute shit. I've never had a girlfriend, or even kissed a girl. I don't have any real friends anymore ,just classmates I hang around at school so people don't think I'm a loner. And the worst part is, I used to be pretty popular, I played some sports, hung out with the ""cool"" jocks, and was pretty socially respected. But over the last few years I've been distancing myself, not talking to my friends because I thought I would annoy them, and getting feelings that they didn't like me anymore. I stopped playing sports because I felt I wasn't good enough to be on a team and I didn't like being watched or put on the spot.

Since I practically lost all of my friends, couldn't talk to girls and just general thought everyone hated me, I developed serious self esteem and confidence issues, and I've pretty much stopped talking all together unless someone asks me a question.

I've always been super skinny, and lanky (the body shape of someone who's over 6'5, but only 5'11), so naturally, I started working out once I lost all my self esteem. I made 0 progress for at least a year which made me feel even more worthless, and it was at this point I started to get seriously depressed, I decided I couldn't do or achieve anything so why even bother? Somehow I managed to persist, and continued to lift weights frequently as an escape from the world. I would put on my headphones, focus on the weights, and forget how horrible I felt. 

After a little while I started to seriously commit to what had become a 6 days a week regime, and I was dedicated (and still am) to the only thing I still enjoy(ed), bodybuilding. 

Jump to now, in the last year I've gained close to 20 pounds of mostly muscle, but I also managed to pick up body dismorphia disorder along the way. I can no longer quite tell what I see when I look in the mirror, but I still see myself as that same scrawny kid, only slightly fatter. I still have no friends and avoid social contact at all costs, I hate school, it feels pointless and half of my time there I'm struggling to not break down and cry. Right now the only time a don't hate myself is when I'm high,  but  if I smoke any more than a bowl (really low tolerance) I have a major panic attack usually resulting in throwing up. 

I feel so small, insignificant and lonely, I think about suicide usually a couple of times a week, I never really consider it, but I like think about how people would finally notice me if I did, you know what I mean? Anyways, this is the year I will finally seek help for the root cause of all my problems, anxiety, and I hopefully ill be able to feel happiness again.",16,2016-01-03 07:58:52 EST-0500
4,DAE feel like they are constantly feeling watched/judged?,"For example if I go to the store, take the bus or even just walking outside. I can't shake the feeling of people watching or judging me.",36,2016-01-02 19:38:52 EST-0500
5,"Suicide prevention hotline saved my life. This story isn't heroic, but one that should be told.","I am a ""normal"" 30 year old woman. I have 2 great kids at home and a wonderful step daughter in college. My husband of 10 years and I live in a nice home with comfortable furnishings. We have a large mastiff, rats, lizards and other fun things to entertain us. We have normal struggles making ends meet sometimes, but nothing drastic. Except, I'm suicidal. 

I can't explain why. Woke up and stubbed your toe? Better kill yourself. 

Because (in my opinion) I have things so good feeling this way makes me unbearably guilty. I watch my kids doing awesome things and am proud of them; still want to die. Shame on me. Guilt. My husband comes home and plays a board game with the family. I play too but, I want to die. Guilt. 

Finally, one night after I really scared myself and I thought I really would do it-- I decided to have one more chance. I called the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline (1-800-273-TALK (8255)). The phone rang and immediately a kind-sounding woman answered. All I could do was sputter. No words were coming out. 

She calmly talked to me through my tears and constant nose-blowing. I'll never know the woman on the other end of that line. I wish I did. I would tell her that she set me on a path that saved my life. If it wasn't for her, or Lifeline, I may not be here to talk about it. 

I never wanted my husband to know. I knew how much it would hurt him to know how I felt. He would take it personally. 

Lucky for me-- he was awake while I was making that late night, sobbing phone call. He was laying in bed listening from the other room. 

I felt better after speaking to Lifeline. I was glad my husband heard, although ashamed. He took me to an emergency room. 

From the E.R., he was asked to leave. I was alone. I was scared. The staff went through my bag, pulling drawstrings out of my sweat pants and cutting the underwire out of my bras. They made me don a gown, mesh underpants and slipper socks. It basically felt horrible. 

Feeling vulnerable and like a big dumb alien, I was herded out with the rest of the people in the psychiatric ward for suicidal people. I won't lie. It was horrifying. There were people in there with thick bandages around their necks and wrists. People yelling and violent. People like me, scared and trying to blend in with the wall.

First thing I did was go to the room they assigned me. I of course had a room mate. She was a woman about my age. She was loud and jittery. It put me on edge. I climbed into the bed and tried to go to sleep. Slept I did. For almost 2 whole days. I just shut down, shut everyone out and slept. 

I awoke to a nurse gathering my things. ""You're moving up, sister."" she said. It scared me. Everything else in there was scary-- this probably would be too. 

Lucky for me, being ""moved up"" (upstairs) was the best thing that could happen to me. 

It was a ward just for people with disabilities or needed medical attention more so than just routine psychiatrics. I have severe asthma, mass on my lung, and COPD (I don't even smoke-- never did). 

The third floor was quiet. Fewer people. The people in there had things like me, or were pregnant, mentally delayed, wheelchair bound etc. Much less intimidating. For someone with fierce panic/anxiety disorder this was much better. 

I started going to group. I started talking to people around me. I started even befriending a mentally handicapped man in a wheelchair. He needed a lot of help. I ate my lunch next to him to discreetly help him cut up his food. It was as good for him as it was for me that we were friends. 

I learned that people who talk to Jesus don't care a thing about logic. The best thing you can do is ask them how that makes them feel and enjoy the ride of their conversation.

Day to day, I felt better. I got incredibly homesick. I got better. A doctor was there every day. Therapists and counselors were too. All of the staff was wonderful. They listened. They didn't judge. The people around me didn't either. 

I'm home now. VERY happy to be home. VERY happy to be alive. I still feel anxious. I still have thoughts of harming myself. I still don't go to family/friend functions but, I am significantly better. 

If you feel like you could take your own life, try the hotline. Go to the E.R. There is help for you. 

If you know someone who is unstable, encourage them. In any way you can. (You can pull a chain but you can't push it.)

Calling 1-800-273-TALK (8255) saved my life. 

Going to the E.R. let the cat out of the bag to the family. Now that everyone knows my darkest secret-- I have a new found support system. It's okay to let people in on how you feel. 

Sometimes, it might be the person you least suspect. Share Lifeline's website on a social media page. Give the phone number to someone. You never know who's life it will save. It could be someone you'd never suspect.",45,2016-01-06 08:53:42 EST-0500

9,I just spoke in front of 200 people,"Before the Xmas break I was informed that I'd be speaking in front of 200 coworkers on our first day back from break. At that moment, I've been terrified of this day. 

I just got back from the event, the speech went ok.  I had a bunch of things written down but I pretty much just memorized it and don't need to look at my notes. 

I take Ativan for extreme anxiety when I know it will happen (flights, public speaking) but I still somehow become very nervous to where you can hear it in my voice. 

Anyone have any tips that have been in similar situations. I'm really proud of myself for doing this but I know I can do better. Any help is greatly appreciated. Thanks. 

Edit: by the way, thank you to everyone. Since 12/17 (the day I found out I was giving a speech), I've been dreading this day. I even thought about calling in sick but I know that that would've made me feel terrible and like a coward. I'm really proud of myself for going through with even though the build up to it can be painful. ",17,2016-01-04 18:19:54 EST-0500

14,"[Making Progress!] Hey everyone! I'd like to share my new coping method with you, and would love for you to try it with me!","Hey guys! I've been in an exceptionally good mood this morning after work. While browsing an Askreddit thread asking how everyone ""unwinds,"" a few gears began turning in my head and I thought of a new way to help calm myself down / remind myself to be happy during trying times. 

What I did was open the notepad on my phone (iPhone). It has a feature that allows you to post photos directly from your gallery to the note. I filled this particular note with a bunch of memories that make me happy, things that remind me of life's peculiar nature of bringing in happiness when I least expect it, and the people I have that make love worth living. You can do yours in any fashion, as this is all based on personal experiences. 

Here's a few screenshots of mine, with minor edits for privacy reasons. 

http://imgur.com/a/TFxWD

These screenshots may be meaningless, strange, or just downright unintelligible to you; but to me? To me they mean happiness. They show me that life can be wonderfully spontaneous and filled with joy when you least expect it. 

Make your own note. Fill it with love, with peace. Fill it with those little moments that help keep your feet on the ground when all you want to do is become detached; caged in the confines of your own mind in the worst possible light. 

I hope this can help you too, even slightly. 

Stay happy, stay calm, and enjoy yourselves everyone. Have an amazing day and stay true to yourself. ",9,2016-01-03 21:07:00 EST-0500
15,Does anyone else jumble their words up a bit? Is this anxiety related?,"I have battled anxiety my whole life it seems. It's recently gotten better, where as I still get nervous sometimes I can hold a conversation and am no longer that awkward quiet guy at work that can hang but rarely speaks. 

But in certain situations I find that I jumble my words up. Not so much speak them out of order, but I replace words mid-word or use the wrong tense or something. For example:

""The bin was full up this morning when I got here"" 

I meshed ""The bin was full"" and ""the bin was filled up"" into one awkward sentance.

It feels like it stems from being tired, needing to slow down before I speak yet at the same time not speaking my mind and letting words flow off the tounge. 

I also have experiences where I may want to speak or participate, but physically feel like I cannot as my voice feels weak and I can't put any life into what I'm saying. There's no anxiety, just a complete physically aversion to wanting to speak. 

In fact that is what concerns me a bit. Even in times where I feel comfortable I feel like I can't fucking speak.",20,2016-01-05 00:00:30 EST-0500
16,Took M last night. My anxiety is out of control today.,"Has this happened with anyone else?  Last night was amazing,  I swear it's what it must feel like to not live with anxiety! 


But this morning. .. I can't catch my breath and my chest is so tight it hurts. Everything seems scary right now,  none of my normal coping mechanisms are working and I don't even know how to answer my boyfriend when he asks about what would help.


EDIT: I know I haven't responded to everyone, but I just wanted to say thank you to everyone to took the time to respond. It means a lot that complete strangers took the time to talk me through a really rough day.",46,2016-01-01 22:16:34 EST-0500
17,51 yo. with addiction problems. somehow never got into trouble with police but finally did.,"Felony possession ( charged ). Aggravated Assault ( arrested but not charged ).

I have bad anxiety on any given day but when I really have a reason to be anxious,   EDIT: then anxiety goes through the roof. 

Lost my job, job is disputing my pay, eviction, car repo; I have all this coming up now. 

Can't contact my lawyer.  I have no idea what is going on legally except for a court date. 

I never got charged for the aggravated assault so I am probably ok but I don't know.

But the arrest will always be there. 

Terrified of the police now. Went to pre trial services a couple weeks ago. I was shaking so hard I could barely fill out the paperwork.  

I needed to do some things today but was so shaky.  Extreme paranoia. Bad dreams, can't sleep but when I do, dream about the police coming to get me. 

I need to get back on meds. 

The other person involved, I am afraid she is going to have me murdered. I am starting to think this is in my head though. 

I am afraid to walk down the street. 

Just venting I guess. I have to pull it together or I will have no chance. 

Just wish I could sleep. ",4,2016-01-04 18:42:51 EST-0500
18,"Boyfriend confirmed worst fears tonight, and I don't know how to handle it.","Hey r/Anxiety. Thanks in advance for any input.

I have been taking notes on ""Loving Someone With Anxiety"" by Kate N. Thieda and going over them with my boyfriend. My boyfriend has had anxiety in the past, but not as severely as mine.

There's a section of the book that discusses how my anxiety can give him anxiety, and it offered up some sample questions that he has about my anxiety. We point out things in the notes by highlighting on a Google doc, and he highlighted that he was worried he would develop an anxiety disorder because of me, and the other question was ""What if I get sick of dealing with this and want to leave?""

I'm feeling a lot of conflicting feelings. I'm very sad and hurt to know that he has these thoughts because of me, but then I'm scared to bring up how I feel because it's related to my anxiety. I'm also angry that he feels this way, because he knew I had anxiety before getting together with me. And then I want to break up with him for feeling this way. I just overall feel very terrible right now, and my borderline isn't helping. 

I don't know what to do, but I'm very hurt and just looking for support.",10,2016-01-03 07:16:36 EST-0500
19,"Is anyone else very adamant about not using speakers, only headphones?","I can't stand using speakers and broadcasting my electronic's contents out to the world.

20,Worst new year ever,"So 2nd day into the new year, and I had the worst day I've had in years. 

First on my way to work I saw a man get hit by a car. He was screaming in pain, and the entire bus was stopped to phone an ambulance. No one was willing to get out and check on him except me - the incredibly blood-phobic girl. Sobbed the entire way through putting pressure on his wounds, apologising and trying to calm him down until the ambulance got there then immediately fainted and was covered in blood. 

3 hours into my work day, when I dragged myself in I discovered the best friend I've ever had died. In Hawaii. Where I can't get to her. This woman was my life, we were very nearly engaged on many occasions. 

All of this has led to a perfect anxiety storm. I'm scared of the bus, I'm scared of cars, I can't focus and that increases my anxiety. 

And I don't know what to do, who to turn to. It's only been a day and I'm terrified. 

And of course every time I've tried to talk about it I've been ignored or just plain shot down. So I'm sorry for the wall of text, I just... Need to say it to someone I guess. ",11,2016-01-03 22:25:50 EST-0500
21,The fear of death gives me panic attacks,"Hi. 

I am aware that this might sound odd, but since I was about seven years old I have been intensely scared of death. I lost my grandmother at that age, and was in a catholic school. I realized at that time when I started to wonder about where my grandmother would go, that I had no belief, and did certainly not belief in any afterlife. That's when the thought arose that the end is permanent, infinite, forever, meaning that it is the opposite of life, and going on endlessly. Life will never be again. Never! 


(EXISTENTIAL CRISIS!) 


I (25/F) still have this fear and it only seems to get worse. Right now I'm obsessed with my fathers health. He has and incurable cancer. 


The thought about the fear of death goes on and on in a loop in my head until I have trouble breathing. I feel terrible and sick to my stomach. I get a panic attack. I used to think this was common, but none of my friends of family have had this experience.


People who say that death is nothingness and just like being unconscious, or just like it was before you were born are not quite getting what I fear the most. I fear the permanence of death that goes on for all eternity, which means I will never experience life again, ever, and never see my loved ones again. That wouldn't matter if I had never experienced life. But it might be simular to a person becoming blind after having had a perfect vision, and knowing that you will never get the vision back. It's pretty scary.


Fear is after all irrational. Right now I'm reading a book called *The Denial of Death* by Dr. Ernest Becker. I'm going to read some works of Heidegger and Kierkegaard and try to live my life with the knowledge that death is impending, and we never know when. So at least that gives me a tiny bit of satisfaction - knowing I will use this as a power to be as good a person as I possibly can while I'm here.


I think it would be good to talk to somebody who has experienced this, or has some good advice since I have difficulty sleeping and feel like nobody understands this.


Live long and prosper.

23,Job recruiters for people with anxiety or other mental illness.,"Is there such a thing as Job Recruiters / Head Hunters that specialize in dealing with employees with depression, anxiety, bipolar disorder etc. and matching them up with appropriate jobs that maximize their chance of being successful?  Or are Job Recruiters always presumed to be working for the employer, not the employee?  I'm not talking about 'job coaches' or advocates in government agencies, I'm talking about honest-to-goodness for-profit head hunters.

If such things exist, do they exist for high-level 'professional' salaried jobs, and not just for entry level or hourly work?

I suspect this does not exist, but I wouldn't mind being pleasantly surprised.  I would fear that disclosing any psychological issues to a head hunter would be a good way to never get work again (possibly even blacklisted).  On the other hand I think it would make sense for head hunters to try to match employees with jobs they have the best chance of success in if (and this is a *very big if*), the head hunters see that this is the best way to get repeat business from employers.",11,2016-01-06 00:25:34 EST-0500

26,Caffeine is rocket fuel for anxiety,"I saw a post about coffee down the sub, and think it's worth an even broader discussion here.

I've had anxiety issues for thirty years. These days I'm far better now than ever before. Almost free of it.

The biggest factors were seeing a shrink, doing the Landmark Education (it's a seminar series aimed at breaking down cognitive self-sabotage, primarily)... and quitting caffeine.

Of these three things, the caffeine was the biggest, most tangible game-changer.

I have a cup of caffeinated tea in the morning. That's it. No soda, no coffee, no Red Bull or any other energy drinks; not even coffee ice cream for the rest of the day. I'm also a 4-hour-per-night insomniac, so I thought dropping caffeine would kill me.

Truth is, I'd feel perkier with caffeine in my system. But I'd also be anxious a lot more. It's physical: the crawling-up-the-back sensation. The buzz. The sweating and nerves. It's mental: can't stop ruminating about things, worry about remote possibilities, dwell on past failures.

There's no question it's the caffeine. I experimented with it, going cold turkey for several months, then adding it back in at gradual increasing doses. Plateaued several times to make sure it wasn't a temporary response to the increase. Sure enough, even at very low doses, the caffeine popped my anxiety. Three cups of coffee over the course of 18 hours would have me climbing the walls.

So this is an informal study with only one subject, but if you suffer from anxiety and you consume caffeine, in my experience, the caffeine may be boosting your symptoms through the roof. Do the therapy and whatever other work helps. But while you're at it, consider that this commonplace substance, which nature evolved to addict insects to certain flowers, may have no role to play in an anxious person's life.",98,2016-04-12 16:32:50 EDT-0400

29,any men over 30 with anxiety ?,"Just wondering if there are any guys here (anywhere on Reddit or the Internet) who're in their late 20s or older and struggle with anxiety. 

This is a great subreddit and everyone is so supportive of one another, and yet when I don't see anyone at all who'se even close to my age, I can't help but come away from here feeling like I'm fighting a problem that I should have outgrown a long time ago. And it's hard not to feel ashamed and weird about that. I don't have to feel that way, I know, but I'm far beyond being able to think about any of this stuff on a rational level.

I know that's just the nature of reddit and that the population here doesn't reflect real life and such but yeah, I don't know, I've just been looking for anybody at all who I can relate to just a little bit when it comes to trying to deal with this every day and, I don't know.

It all feels really shameful, this is a problem that kids and college students have and maybe grown women can admit to struggling with this without losing face but I don't know if I've evr come across any men over 30 who have ever posted anything here. And I'm sure they have but I'm just talking about my personal experience and impressions from lurking here (and on r/depression, which I could probably post the same thing about). Would be awesome if there was some kind of special subreddit for people over 30 with anxiety but even r/REDDITOVER30 hardly gets any posts on a given week. r/nontrads is dead, too (or was never alive in the first place).

I'm super stressed and scared anout getting older, feel ashamed and embarrassed that I haven't accomplished more un my life at 36, feel really withdrawn from people my own age and always feel like everybody younger than me (at work and at school) is judging me, I can't control my thoughts and emotions and always feel wound up and in a panic. I've struggled with depression all my life but it wasn't until a year ago when anxiety stopped being something that I'd experience purely in strange social situations and something that I just started to feel all the time in places thatI used to feel safe, comfortable, and relaxed in. I'm almost done with school and need to focus and keep myself composed but my heart is racing all the time and I can't shut off my thoughts to concentrate on anything anymore. I'd love to get counseling but I only have Medicaid and after 2 months I'm still trying to get it set up and based on past experiences of simply trying to see a doctor, any doctor, for a routine physical, I don't have high hopes for getting into any counseling that could be close to me or work with my schedule. I don't even know if that's what I need, but I just want some help and I don't know where to turn.

That's assuming that I'm even worth spending any effort or money on. Young people need and deserve help, but I've literally never seen anyone in my situation who's come out of it okay and I'm wondering if... that's just the way it is? Like, you had your run, you can't cope with things anymore, too bad, suck it up and be a man, right? I really, really wonder if that's the reality I'm running from.

I really don't want to deal with this anymore. Has anyone who's not ""young"" anymore ever dealt with this problem, or atleast found their way to the beginning of trying to find solutions to fix it? I just feel so beaten down by this, is this a moral failing of mine? Did I just wuss out and do this to myself? If that's the case, do I simply deserve to feel meek and nervous and scared and down on myself for itevery day? We always tell young people ""it gets better"" but we never say that to anybody over 30 and is there a good reason for that?

Sorry this went on and on, I don't have anyone to talk ti about this. I mean, I do, but I feel like it only beings her down and that that's selfish of me and it never really makes me feel any better, it only makes me more aware of how far I've fallen from being the kind of confident and competent person that I always thought I'd be at this age. And to be so far from that feels so damn pathetic I can barely find the words for it.",66,2016-04-10 20:38:51 EDT-0400
30,"caring too much about what others think, even in anonymity","I created this Reddit account so I could anonymously discuss things I didn't want attached to my real life or online identity.

I hate being anxious about perceptions of me... even in complete and total anonymity and from fleeting strangers I know nothing about and may never encounter again. I seem to just not be able to handle being thought of as stupid.

31,Xanax makes me feel normal again.,"23 y/o male with PD here. After being diagnosed in 2014, I went on Zoloft with a 0.25 mg Xanax prescription. I've always been somewhat opposed to medications, especially those used for mental conditions, but at the time I was such a wreck I decided that I needed to do something. 

After feeling my anxiety was well under control, I got off the Zoloft and have been off for about one year now. It can be a bit of a struggle living with anxiety without daily meds, but I deal with it using exercise, yoga, meditation, therapy and a good diet. It's tough and requires a lot of will, but I'd say I'm still pretty happy. 

I still have the 0.25 mg Xanax prescription, though I rarely use it out of pure guilt. I feel weak when I get anxious and want to take one, and only ever actually do so when I'm about to crack. After going through a breakup this weekend, I built up the courage to take a single 0.25 mg tab last night for the first time in months. 

Holy f*$& what a difference I felt upon awakening. 

It's like a tiny 0.25 mg of heaven. I don't feel loopy, high, tired or zombie-like. I feel...normal. I feel like I'm ME again. Anxiety seems to make me forget who I am, as it seems that I am always consumed with worry and panic. 

I know the effects of the Xanax will eventually wear off today, and I don't plan on taking it daily, but I guess the point of this is that it's comforting to know that I can feel normal again.

Edit: deleted strange text at bottom of post.

33,"Have had Anxiety since October and it is ruining my life, I am no longer myself and behave completely different. Please read and share your input.","As stated, I've been having Anxiety since October of last year and what triggered it was chest discomfort which led to a panic attack (Ended up going to the hospital as I had the feeling of dying). Stress building up over the years is the main culprit but I honestly don't know. What mainly triggers my anxiety is stress, and heart rate increase, along with shortness of breath and chest discomfort. Almost everyday when these happen, i ask myself if its just anxiety or actual problems in my body. I have trouble sleeping almost each night, laying down only makes it worse. Heart palpitations are daily. I am prescribed Teva-Lorazepam which I only take .50 when I really need it. 
My mood, attitude, the way I speak to the way I interact with people have all changed..I don't even feel healthy anymore, I feel really deprived and the life I had before is no longer there. Socialization/going out is very low and miss out on opportunities. 
Being a college student and soon to graduate in about a month, I don't know what to do..especially when it comes to presenting in front of large crowds in class. I feel depressed, I am no longer me, I can't really talk about what I experience with people without the thought of them looking at me differently.

Would greatly appreciate any comments, help or input.",37,2016-04-09 10:21:02 EDT-0400
34,DAE absolutely despise when people use their anxiety/fake anxiety for attention?,"Let me preface this by saying that seeking help for anxiety isn't bad, that's something completely different. That being said, I've been noticing a growing ""trend"" (especially among high schoolers, of which I am) of people who advertise their anxiety to get sympathy. I see so many tweets/texts/whatever that are just ""oh my anxiety is so bad I'm so stressed all of the time"" almost as if it's something to be proud of. Yes, I have anxiety, but compared to other people, I don't think it's that bad, and I'm seeing a therapist about it and it's definitely gotten better. However, I've really only told a few of my closest friends about it and try really hard to not use it to get attention or as an excuse. 

Also, I'm pretty sure a lot of people complaining about it don't really have it. I'm sure some do, but if everyone who claimed to have anxiety, OCD,or depression actually had it, 80% of the world would be struggling with it. It just can really piss me off sometimes, because anxiety is not something to be proud of, it's a serious problem that needs help. ",36,2016-04-11 04:45:59 EDT-0400
35,Does anyone else feel anxiety is compromising their grasp on reality?,"I feel like I have made so many positive changes this year to cope with my social anxiety. Among many things, I don't binge drink to be numb, or negatively perseverate over my conversational contributions, or obsess to fill in lulls in conversation anymore. 

I confronted these things because I recognized that they don't have any place in the person I am and know that I can be when I am not letting the anxiety win.

In terms outside of anxiety, it's probably counter intuitive, but I get more anxious being around new people the more I respect them. I suppose I'm afraid that I'll disappoint them. 

This fear is most apparent to me in regards to the exceptionally wonderful people in my life that invite me into their social circles from time to time. It feels amazing and I cannot stress enough how privileged I feel to be included. But it has a back to the wall feel in some ways.

I know it's important to the friends that bring me around that I fit in and have fun. They love me, and I know that there's also an element of relief for them in me enjoying myself, and there's purpose for me, being there to support them. The fact that I really like who these people are and admire the way they carry themselves compounded with the need to fit in and be accepted for the friends that bring me around is a lot for me take on sometimes.

I try to stay positive and I quell the phobic feels, but I'm worried it sends the wrong message to them when I try to be overly considerate, and not assume I should invite myself along. I'm sensitive, and it seems like the right thing to do, given my past, because I don't expect some of the people who saw me in my old unsavory ways to change their opinions—I can only hope for the best. That's okay.

Lately, I do feel like I'm making up for it and managing to find some success in reconnecting with some of the people that I feel I alienated before. I feel much less like an outsider now than I used to.

One of these friends told me tonight that I always act like in just waiting for the chance to get away and leave. I can accept this as an honest communication from my friend of how they feel. I don't question their genuineness in telling me this. I do hesitate to put myself out there because I am simply trying to be considerate, and I worry they may read this as me being disinterested to being in this part of their life—which is far from how I feel.

I sort of hope their feelings correlate with my hesitation or lack of eagerness. If that's what's going on, I can understand why they feel this way.

What's more worrisome to me is if this is what everyone in that social circle genuinely thinks is going on with me. It's crushing, to be completely unaware if I am sending this message. It makes me question if the progress I've made is real or just in my head.

What's worse, is I feel comfortable being around these people finally. I hold them in such high regard. It has taken a lot of work for me to get here, and hearing this news would be debilitating. I'm worried the stigma would make me regress around them.

I don't know what I'm looking for by posting this, but advice? Tips? Experiences? Honestly, I've already calmed down a lot since writing this, so that's nice. 

TL;DR- I've had recent success managing my social anxiety. I feel new confidence being around people I hold in high regard that my anxiety alienated in the past. My friend says I act like I am always trying to ditch out on social gatherings and I think it's because I hesitate and don't seem eager enough. I'm they're right and I haven't made the progress I thought I did. ",8,2016-04-14 16:04:56 EDT-0400
36,"I'm sorry if this shouldn't be posted here, but does anyone know of ways to make an income online (due to social anxiety)?","Hi, 

A bit of a backstory (First three paragraphs, skip if uninterested)

I'm a trans gal with social anxiety stemming predominantly from the fact that I'm transgender (male to female), and very sensitive to negative reactions to me being trans that I get from some strangers (such as in a customer service environment).  Before I came out, I was able to be in society because I was just a shell, not really feeling anything, and the little times when I did show myself, I got negative reactions (or at least I interpreted them as negative) and immediately shelled up again and didn't let myself feel, out of fear of being vulnerable. 

I came out last year and it crushed me socially. I thought I would be able to function, but I was *not*.  I also smoked a bit too much green stuff, and got really paranoid, and had some borderline traumatic experiences. Couple that with the trauma built up over years of essentially wearing a mask, caused me to crumble.  I became quite literally a recluse, and hated myself for it. Living in a house with 5 guys who partied a lot, I would only leave my room to get water and food and use the bathroom.  Everytime I had to go into a communal area, I'd wait to hear if anyone was in the area (I lived in the basement and could hear the movement above because the house had thin walls and floors) because I was literally deathly afraid of interaction.  

I'm a bit improved from then, but now I'm living back with my parents and quit college (due to not being able to go to class).  I was only going for a degree in philosophy though, so I don't consider it a major loss.  

So now I'm here, asking if there's any chance anyone knows of any legitimate and reliable ways to make some money online?  I have the luxury of being fed and housed by my parents, and don't have to pay rent and buy groceries thus, although I still don't enjoy living with them because they don't fully understand what it means to be trans (but they're trying).  

Things I've looked into are freelancing and making music. I'm also probably going to start a kickstarter or gofundme to ask for help to pay the insane costs of my surgical bills (for genital and face surgery in the next few years--face surgery is necessary due to masculinized bone shaping such as a brow ridge). 

I think I could get a job in the ""real world"" if I absolutely had to, but it would mean going back to that place of not feeling anything, and pretending, and I hated that so much.  

TL;DR:  I have residual social anxiety due to being transgender and would like to make money online if possible-to avoid having to present in society as more male, or to be beat down by negative reactions to being trans that I can't handle yet, and am wondering if there are perhaps any suggestions as to how to do that?

My entire head feels like its falling in on itself… breaking into big chunky pieces and crushing my brain, crushing my mind. I look up symptoms of an aneurysm because its such a tight, painful feeling. I do not have the other symptoms, but it does not stop the worry. My throat is tight. It feels like I can’t breathe. It feels like my chest and my throat are working against me. My respiration is thought out. Calculated. Forced. There is no one thing worrying me. There is no one thing that could possibly go wrong. Anything could go wrong. Anything could happen. I’m stuck in these worries. I’m stuck in my mind. I’m trapped in the idea that something could happen.. and the more time that goes in between something bad happening, the more I worry something is going to happen. The worst is inevitable. I don’t feel in my body, but I can’t get away from my mind.
My mind is devoted to these fears. Tied unconditionally, the bond cannot be broken. It consumes my mind. It consumes my body. My mind creates pain for my body, because the mental suffering is not enough.

48,"Last year I overcame my anxiety, I hope it can give you some inspiration!","Hi everyone! 

I've been following this subreddit for a long time back when I was suffering from my anxiety, it gave me a lot of support! I have returned anxiety-free and hopefully this post will help someone out there with this hidden illness.

Anxiety for me came from a depressive spell in my early teens. It truly hit me when I turned 17, when I nearly broke down doing a mini presentation in a class of only 3 people, all of whom I knew well. For the next two years of school, I turned down a lot of opportunities, dropped most of activities outside of school, and lived a monotonous routine where I'd study at school then hide at home until the next day. The consequences of these actions made me a bad perfectionist, I'd beat myself up about not getting 100% in a test for example. 

The anxiety peaked last summer when a few traumatic events happened and I didn't get into college (but now I am). Living in the countryside meant that I rarely saw my friends or left my local radius. Consequently, things like going to the supermarket, getting my hair cut or meeting up with friends would give me chills, nausea and shaky hands, it was terrible and I feel for you if you get the same! I'm also one of those people who'd panic if they felt ill in front of others, so my anxiety about being sick ultimately made me ill. It felt like a huge disability and I ended up lying to friends and family about not being able to go out with them, just because it would frighten me so much.

But then in September I realised that my life had reached a dead point and I needed to change it. So:

- I went on vacation abroad with my cousin. It was a fantastic experience and something that I really wanted to do, but never really thought I could go through with it. Sure, I felt anxious at times, especially waiting for my first flight, but it truly helped me to discover that 'living in the moment' feeling. Meditation never worked for me, but going on a road trip meant that everyday was different and my mind was completely focussed on the present. Plus I had my relative there to anchor me and offer me support if need be. 

- I went outside in the day. When I came back from the vacation, I started going outside a lot, whether it's just for a walk, doing some exercise or even when I wanted to text my friends! 

- I cut out my social media habits. I cut out my facebook news feed so that nobody's lives bothered me, instead I'd make the effort to see my friends and have a 1:1 chat, it made such a difference! It ultimately occurred to me that social media was really a way of people seeking attention that they aren't getting, almost a cry for help. If I see my friend post a 'happy' selfie on instagram, I ask them if they're okay and most of the time they're actually pretty down. 

- I called for take-out deliveries. Sounds crazy but I suffered from major telephone anxiety, but by writing down a weekly 'pizza delivery' script, I conquered that too once I found myself less reliant on it. Plus I'd be rewarded with pizza. 

A lot of these things are pretty demanding for people to do, I understand that. But what really worked for me was a constant change in environment and adopting an 'imperfectionist' about things. It's certainly a task, but reminding myself to have fun in life was the key. 

All the best! Feel free to ask any questions. :)",3,2016-04-11 21:08:02 EDT-0400

I've seen so much downvoting lately that it is really starting to irk me. Why are you here? Is it because you need help, or would like to help others get through hard times? When someone asks for help, even though you don't see eye to eye with their problem, you shouldn't be downvoting them, period. We are all struggling individuals trying to figure life out, and it may be more confusing to some than to others. Putting people down asking for help is just mind boggling to me. If someone gives bad advice, don't downvote, reply with your opinion so that OP has information from different points of view. We are here to seek help and to give help. If you're not here for that, please excuse yourself and be a civil human being. So many people are hurting, and seeing them put down even further in places they are trying to seek guidance just doesn't make sense.

64,Social anxiety and lying,"It's amazing how much I lie on a regular basis. They aren't big lies and I'm not actively trying to manipulate people, but I regularly lie to other people as a way to protect myself.

For example, I'm embarrassed about a TV show I like, so if someone asks I tell them I like something else that I deem as more socially acceptable. Or a friend asks to hang out and I tell them I have to work instead of just telling them I don't feel like doing anything. Or my Mom asks how my work is going and I tell her ""it's going well"" because I don't want her to worry.

All of these little lies are some lame attempt to control what others think about me and maintain my reputation. This creates stress as it requires mental energy to maintain the false versions of myself that I am presenting to various people.

I'm not saying there is no place for lies, although I think radical honesty is worth contemplating and experimenting with. Regardless, I need to start being more honest with people. I guess the only thing holding me back is the uncomfortableness and fear of rejection (which is definitely the source of my social anxiety).

I'm interested in hearing others' thoughts on this. I have relatively mild social anxiety. I've made some big strides the past few years and I feel like tackling this honesty problem could be another big step for me.",21,2016-08-03 18:54:55 EDT-0400

I've had ""friend with benefits"" who in reality were not friends and have not benefitted me. I can see now I was used a practice girl before they moved onto women they actually care about.

I have social anxiety and hate myself so expect others to hate me too. Things like eye contact are very difficult. I use alcohol as a tool to try and be fun but it never really works out. Not fishing for compliments here just being straight up : I am not a good looking woman so this also doesn't help. 

Last year I decided to take the plunge and started online dating as I find typing easier than talking. I went on my first ever date last year. I went on a few very unsuccessful ones but eventually found what I'm looking for. He is kind, funny, caring, compassionate and understanding of all my crazy. The first night he put his arms around me I freaked out - no one has ever done that to me before. Then I realised what it was and it is the single happiest memory I have. I felt so safe and lucky to be the one he chose in that moment.

On the night i plucked up the courage to say ""I love you"" for the first time in my life, he dumped me before i got that far. I'm not angry, I don't blame him, he just didn't feel the same way I do.

It's left me absolutely broken. I believe im not good enough for anyone and don't see the point in going on anymore. I just go through the motions every day without feeling anything.

66,"Love my job, but I'm always really anxious before work?","Every day that I have work I get extremely anxious, to the point where I have to basically stop whatever I'm doing and sit down to breathe. I don't know what it is, I love my job and when I'm at work I don't have any issues, everyone is pretty cool with me and we all get along well. In fact, while I'm at work I'm usually having a great time! It's just that before it starts I'm riddled with anxiety. Smoking helps but only so much, and I start shaking some of the days. 

Why would I be so anxious before work if I like my job? Usually I think that it's because I'm afraid of being late or because I have feelings for a coworker, but I just don't see those being any reason for me to have anxiety this bad.

71,Here's how i recently Reduced my Anxiety Problems,"I use to come to the subreddit quite often. About 6 months ago, I started making some changes in my life and I don't think I've ever been happier. Obviously, there are always issues that come up, but for the most part I finally think I've found something that worked for me. I really think for most people there may be things to try before going on meds. 

I wanted to share a few of those things, in an event it helps someone out there in my similar situation.

I'm 33yo. Wife. 2 small kids. Self employed.

1. I started meditating every. single. day. This is by far the most influential factor. r/meditation to learn more. 
2. I researched and learned a little bit about CBT online. (Cognitive Behavioral Therapy). I've used this in conjunction with meditation and mindfulness.
Basically, thoughts are constant and random. Sometimes, we take the negative thoughts (again, completely constant and random) and put a lot of value on them. This, in turn, leads to negative feelings, anxiety and emotions. Usually, these feelings are completely based on nothing.  The goal is to recognize these thoughts as just thoughts. See number 1 in order to better your ability to do this.
3. I exercise more often. 4 to 5 times a week. This is also key.
4. I stopped spending most of my free time on my phone/laptop/TV. See #1
5. I stopped drinking coffee. Switched to tea.
6. I greatly reduced (very recently) the amount of alcohol I consume. 
7. I've also lowered my caloric intake in general (maybe as a result). I never really ate badly, but if I did eat badly, I would have stopped that. I just eat 'less' now.
8. Probably the most important, I had a deep down interest to change the way my brain was working and how I was moving through life. Mainly because I didn't want my kids to experience the negative results of my shitty moods/anxiety. 
Feel free to shoot me a PM if you have specific questions. I really hope this may help someone struggling with some degree of anxiety.

I'm constantly in my head and I'm constantly seeking approval for just about anything I do. 
An example: I do pretty much all the laundry and I took care of a stain on one of my bf's shirts - then asked about 50 times if it was okay that I used ___ stain remover instead of ___ stain remover.

75,Today i helped a student having a panic attack in a way he'd never been helped before - with empathy.,"I am a High School English Teacher. I am also Bipolar, and have lived with anxiety and depression my entire life. It took me nearly 27 years of denial, bottling it in, periods of extreme highs and lows, and constant nagging anxiety before my now wife convinced me to seek medical help - I'm doing much better now thanks to finding the right therapist and psychiatrist :). But enough about me!

Today I was heading down to the copy room to print up some tests for my next class, and I saw an overweight kid (I was a chunky kid in school as well) sitting against the wall. He was shaking and crying, clearly having a panic attack. There were other teachers, and someone from security around him. My coworkers (doing what they thought was right) were asking him over and over ""What's wrong"", ""What happened?"", ""Do you need to talk to someone?"", ""Why are you stressed?"". Every time he would just repeat the same words ""I'm just stressed out"", spiraling worse and worse as he was bombarded.

I came over to check on him, and after seeing what was happening I asked if he could come to my room to decompress for a second, i was on planning after all. They agreed, and we walked over to my classroom. I told him that I have generalized anxiety disorder, and that I've done exactly what he did. Many a time I've let it all overwhelm me and I couldn't tell the people around me any one reason ""why"", when it was just a little bit of everything. I told him that he didn't need to explain, that I knew and understood, and my room was a safe space for him.

He sat there for about 20 minutes, he cried a little more. Composed himself and then told me his name was Eddie. I told Eddie that if he ever needs a safe place that I'll be there for him, and I walked him back to his class, and then ran to make copies of my test.

I hope the rest of his day goes well, and I hope that i've made a good impact on him. Even now I worry that he might be anxious still, but I have faith that he will find the way just like I did.

I don't know when it started exactly but I've been having really intense dreams for more than 2 years now. They are like movies, very realistic stuff, and they feel like they last all night, from the time I go to bed to when I wake up. This results in me being totally exhausted in the morning, even though I technically get enough sleep (about 8 hours). 
They are so vivid and life/movielike, I can remember them long after waking up. Sometimes they deal with topics that give me anxiety, which leads to me being anxious the whole day.

I suffer from GAD/minor depression and I've been on meds for that for 1 1/2 years now. One of the side effects of the medication I originally got is ""unusual dreams"", and I switched to another one a few days ago, however this one has the same side effect. 

I'm not sure if the dreams are caused by my meds, DAE have experienced the same thing? I'm grateful for ANY insight and help, I'm feeling really desperate and I just want a good nights sleep again...

79,I think my psychologist visits are working!,"I've posted here before about how I am going through agoraphobia and emetophobia. I used to be extremely scared to leave my house, and would often panic even while at home.  
  
Then I visited a psychologist. I've been there twice now, and have a third scheduled for Monday.  
  
During my first visit I was extremely scared. I was shaking in the car, I was so nervous in the waiting room that I had to leave the room and pace around the hall.  
Then I got in to see the doc. We talked and I was still scared. So scared I couldn't even sit down, I had to stand and pace around.  
  
Then I went again 2 weeks later. This time I was more calm in the car, still a bit nervous. Then I sat and stayed in the waiting room (still anxious and wanting to leave the room but didn't). Then while in the doc's office I managed to get myself to sit down and be calm. It was great!  
  
Then yesterday I managed to get myself to leave the house and go to 3 stores! Sure I was scared, but I managed to get myself to leave my comfort zone and have fun while shopping!

Finally the one thing that finally started to improve things was meditation. 

Turns out meditation has been scientifically studied to help people with anxiety and depression, yet people are not exactly sure how. For me, i've just been popping in my headphones and youtube ""meditation"" choosing whatever length of time I want. 

These two youtube videos have helped a lot:

84,Can't sleep because I'm worried I won't be able to sleep.,"I've been dealing with anxiety attacks on and off for about twelve years.  I'll have long stretches where all's well, then have a bad couple of weeks.  In retrospect, I have noticed my bouts of anxiety occurred most often when I was under stress in my life.  Bad marriage, bad girlfriend, unemployment, so on.  Most recently, my anxiety has been related to sleep.  

I started a new job at the end of last summer that required a radical shift in my sleep patterns.  It's mostly been ok, with the occasional bout of sleeplessness.  Abut ten days ago, I woke up around 0100 because I had to pee (a regular occurrence), but found myself unable to get back to sleep.  A generally un-pleasant 4 hours were spent flipping and flopping, trying in vain to get my mind to let me go back to sleep.  No such luck, so I spent my 12 hour shift in Zombie Mode, mechanically doing my job.  Fast forward to the next night, and I woke up to pee again, as usual.  When I lay back down, I was starting to relax, when I thought, ""Oh man, wouldn't it be terrible if I couldn't get back to sleep?""  This triggered an anxiety response which kept me up again.  For a few days this pattern slowly diminished, until I felt confident in my sleeping abilities again.

Another component of this I should mention is my reading habits.  Every night before bed, I read for an hour or so.  It's my sleep ritual, and it serves to relax me.  I've been doing it so long, I find myself unable to sleep unless I read.  For more than two years, I 've used a Kindle Fire to do this.  I love my Kindle, so much that its use has become to some small extent, a part of my identity.  Over the last week, however, I've been reading physical books, because I found an author  I like a lot at a garage sale (Michael Connelly, if you're interested) and bought a bunch of his books.  Well, I finished those, and I'm back to my trusty Kindle.  Trouble is, I've only recently been exposed to the idea that using Kindles and other screen devices before bed diminishes the quality of your sleep.

So, last night I lay down to read before bed, and I was stricken with the idea that maybe it was my Kindle that was causing the trouble.  This, of course triggered an anxiety response, which kept me awake.  I took a Xanax, but because I've been having trouble lately, I've taken three or four over the past three weeks (FAR above my usual consumption), and I find their effectiveness diminished.  So I tossed and turned more than half the night, finally dropping into a fitful sleep around midnight.

The worst part is that I KNOW I'm doing this to myself.  I've used my Kindle before bed every night for two years, and never had any trouble.  Even my initial bout of sleeplessness was caused by my own brain twisting itself up into a tizzy.  But, as I'm sure many of you are familiar with, knowing the source of the problem isn't enough to treat it.

I'm not sure what I'm looking for by posting this.  Maybe I just needed to rant.  But if any of you have experienced something similar, I'd be glad to hear what happened to you.

But just because I know it means nothing doesn't make it fact in my mind. What ""should"" I be doing? Should I
Be reading more often? Should I enjoy myself and play video games? Should I watch more TV to get a better

89,Physical Manifestations of Anxiety,"For a long time I've been suffering of the worst stomach pains. And when I say worse, I mean sent-me-to-bed-crying-like-a-child worse. I've also had this constant bouts of intermittent diarrhea/constipation. I've been feeling tired all the time and taking 4-hour naps in the middle of the day even when I get full night sleep. 

Yesterday I went to the doctor because I really thought I had a stomach ulcer or a serious physical condition that was bringing me to tears of pain almost every day, and it turns out my stomach, pancreas, and all other GI organs are intact. My doctor told me that my symptoms are greatly due to all the stress I go through (I'm a medical student) and to my anxiety and depression which affects me physically and exacerbates my symptoms. She recommended a diet that will help and ways to manage my stress in order to feel more energized and take my mind off the things that might be causing me these symptoms (I'm already on medication but to be honest, it's still stressful ass h---.) 

To be honest I started crying and was a little cathartic when receiving the news because it's hard to know that not only does my anxiety affect my daily life in terms of what I get to do and the courage I get to build up to do the simplest things: phone calls, texts, random visits, asking for things, etc, but that know it's also taking a toll on my body to the point that it's making me not just mentally, but also physically impaired. 

I know it'd be disgraceful to say ""I wish it had been al ulcer"", but man, it's just really frustrating to know your own mind is playing those games on you. I'm really looking forward to changing these lifestyle choices my doctor told me about and see how everything goes because I have a long journey to go and I can't afford to be feeling sick all the time.",31,2016-04-22 16:41:04 EDT-0400

So I had pretty difficult social anxiety in the past, but I've worked really hard to move past it and in most situations I'm perfectly fine. I guess I still have trouble when I'm getting a service done.

Last weekend I went to the nail salon with my mom to get a pedicure. The lady doing my nails drew the foot bath for me and told me to stick my feet in. At first, I thought the temperature was fine and when she asked me if I needed it turned down I said no. I quickly realized after leaving my feet in for a minute that it was way way too hot. 
The lady came back over and asked about the temperature again, possibly noticing my discomfort, and being the nervous idiot I am I told her it was fine! I don't know why it was so difficult for me to ask her to turn the temperature down.
When she took my feet out of the water to work on them, they were bright red, numb and tingly. There were also some small blisters on the bottoms of my feet. I think she noticed but didn't say anything. Walking out of the salon was so painful. I've been kicking myself for not saying anything about the temperature.

Now a month ago I was in class I had my firsr ever panic attack. My right side went numb (Not a stroke), I got really dizzy, I told myself I was going to die, uncomfortable and depersonilization. I went to my family doctors and the childrens hospital of Ottawa where the performed a neurological exam and did some extensive question.

The weeks following I non-stopped worried it could be a brain tumor because my dad had one at my age. Even though I told the doctors about my worries and they assured me it wasn't.

I developed insomnia and worried 24/7 I had a brain tumor. I had some symptoms that came and went and some that stayed . 
I constantly even to this day feel like I'm in a dream and I had some really bad dizzyness.

Eventually I accepted last week that if this was a brain tumor I would've probably passed out or had a seizure by now.

I've met some incredible people on my journey who will continue to be my friends :).

I've started feeling better and believing my friends, family, doctors and therapist and accept is just some bad anxiety, mild depression and acute stress disorder.

* Positive Affirmations
* Meditation
* listening to either calming music or dance music
* Just dancing and letting the body go (helps stay in the present m moment)
* Exercise/Yoga
* Go to sleep early/don't eat at least 2 hrs before you go to sleep
* Drink cold,refreshing water
* Write (short story, poetry)
* Read a favorite book
* Learn about a new topic
* Do some gardening, play with pets
* Have a routine in the morning (drink tea, read news, etc)
* Eat healthy (make a delicious smoothie)
* Pamper yourself (face mask, new haircut, doing nails)
* Make yourself laugh by watching comedy
* Go outside, look at nature, feel the sun on your body
* Think about what you're grateful for
* Talk to somebody about their day 
* Involve yourself deeply in something
* Volunteer
* Rely in your faith, either religious or spiritual to anchor you. 

* Stay outside and busy, in the midst of people. For most people, anxiety happens when they are alone and have nothing to do. Staying outside instead of holing up in your room and doing the computer.  Experience life!

* When you do get anxious, have a certain step plan to get yourself out of it (rationalizing, staying calm by breathing deeply, counting, taking it one step at a time)

Stay away from the things that cause you anxiety. For me, I have debilitating health anxiety, so I stay away from the computer. I try to stay in a positive mental space so I don't have recurring negative thought loops. 

* Know that you're going to have good days and bad days. It isn't always good. If you do have bad days, figure out a plan to get yourself out of that negative thinking and start again in a positive mental space.",3,2016-04-26 01:22:15 EDT-0400

104,The best things you've done to help with your anxiety? Here are mine,"I'm like the rest of you. Have anxiety issues. But they're going away so I'm sharing my successes and looking to learn more. 

1. I started running almost daily. If I don't feel like running, I will walk twice as long. Get moving! Just do it. 

2. Weight lifting. When you see yourself becoming more physically attractive you'll have less anxiety. 

3. Quit masturbating. No one wants to talk about  this, but if you watch porn, jerk off all the time. Quit that shit. Helped me and helps a lot of people. I'm not a doctor and I don't know why it helps, but it does. 

4. Eat better. Doesn't take much effort or money. Start by cutting out the junk food. Eat more veggies and fruit. Don't like veggies and fruit? Eat them anyway. Eat more protein. Learn to love it and your body and mind will reward you. Potatoes are inexpensive good food for example. 

5. Supplement. This is different for everyone. I'm always playing with this and changing it up. I always try to take a multivitamin and  omega supplements. Because I can't afford to eat like a king nor do I have time. 

6. Take up some hobbies that get you involved with other people, preferably members of your own gender. If youre a man with anxiety, you probably could benefit from learning more about actually being a man. This was a recent wake up call for me to grow up. 

7. If youre a single or married man, learn to up your game in general. Read books about relating to women. It will improve your marriage. If you're single, it will improve your relationships with women. If you're a woman, I don't know the best approach for you in this category. 

8. Save money. Be careful with your money. Make a plan for what you will do with your saved money. Your life might be boring because you don't know where you're really going. This was my issue. Once I had solid plans for what I wanted to do as I grew older, every aspect of my life improved. Quit spending so much money on stuff that gives you instant gratification. Bank it instead and prepare your hail Mary. 

9. Meditate. Set aside time each day for your mind to think about nothing. Just sit there and breathe. Let your mind do the rest. 10 minutes is enough but do what is practical for you. 

10. Quit spending so much time on the Internet. The Internet has all your answers I'm sure. But only in words. You must act to see results.",67,2016-09-07 07:29:02 EDT-0400
105,How to deal with that feeling of dread on the way to work/school?,[deleted],24,2016-09-06 15:06:47 EDT-0400
106,"Neurologically, what's happening inside the minds of those with generalized anxiety disorder?","At a neuronal level, what do you think is going on with people who experience anxiety? I have suffered from anxiety for as long as I can remember. For the past year and a half I've been on the SSRI fluoxetine. I noticed a slight effect for a long time, then a much larger positive effect after upping my dose. Eventually my anxiety almost completely disappeared. I became accustomed to feeling pretty much like a normal person should and figured it had been me who had matured, and that the drugs were just a boost in the right direction but were now incidental. I no longer felt the need or the desire to keep taking three small capsules every morning. So a couple months ago I decided to come off the fluoxetine. Much like how my progression to feeling normal was a slow process, my emotional state has steadily been declining since I came off. It's different to how it was before, because pre-antidepressants that persistent feeling of anxiety and dread was the only feeling that I knew. That was my baseline. I figured that was how everyone felt. Now as I feel myself slowly slipping back into this familiar mindset I realise that this feeling of impending doom that I am constantly experiencing is being created by some neuronal process in my brain. I know for a fact that it is artificial but still I cannot overcome it with will power. The well-reasoning part of my brain (which is slowly losing its power to the emotions of dread and anxiety re-colonising my brain) is screaming at me that this is not right. There is no way that a human being should feel like this simply by existing. Okay, now I don't even remember why I started writing this post. Oh yeah, so neurologically, what is it that separates 'normal' people from those with anxiety disorders? I guess my point was that now that I've been on both sides it has become clearer that, in general, the world does not change, only your perception of the world changes. It's not the experiences you have, but how you view them that gives them meaning. Notice how I said 'how you view them,' not 'how you decide to view them.' I've realised that although you may have some small notion of free will when it comes your judgement of experiences, you are programmed (biologically and through your upbringing) to respond emotionally in a certain way to an experience. This deep-seated emotion (anger, fear, dread) then affects behaviour, which in turn affects emotion again in a feedback loop.

My thoughts are scattered and I don't know where I'm going with this so I'm going to stop writing now, but I'd like to hear what others are thinking.",36,2016-09-01 19:21:41 EDT-0400
107,I just gave a speech to 200+ people,"I was at a wedding as the best man and had to give a speech to over 200 people. Arms heavy, mouth dry, when I got that mic I fucking nailed it. This is a **HUGE** victory for me as I've suffered from social anxiety for years. In fact, it wasn't too long ago I was so anxious that I couldn't have a friend over because of randomly generated agoraphobia. I was terrified up to it... I couldn't even eat. I had it written down but improvised a bit, got a lot of laughs,  etc. 


I just wanted to say if I can do *that*, you all can do anything. I was so relieved to just be over. I was a bit fast in reading the first paragraph, but felt decent after the first one and nailed the rest.

108,What anxiety feels like for me:,"Anxiety feels like I have a job and my job is to take care of a machine. Every other employee is doing the same thing with their own machines and when they start, everyone is given a manual to use the machine. Except I wasn't given the manual. So I'm sitting here trying to do maintenance, change parts, upgrade it and I'm trying very hard, but of course it isn't working because I know nothing about this machine - I can ask coworkers or my supervisors and they will attempt to explain it to me but it's useless, when I think I understand something and I'm doing something right something breaks again. And when I try to ask for the manual, the response is confused ""But you got the manual, everyone gets it on their first day!"" And I just sheepishly mutter that I must've lost it even though I know that I never had it and I keep on trying to fix my smoking machine without knowing what I'm doing.",7,2016-09-07 14:30:05 EDT-0400
109,"If you live in fear of heart palpitations, please read this","I have gotten heart palpitations since I was 15. The first time it happened, I thought I was dying and sent myself to the ER, wore a 48 hour halter monitor, only to have my results come back normal. I'm 23 now and since my anxiety is so bad and I was an alcoholic up until a few months ago, I got them very frequently. In fact it's hard to tell at this point if I get them because of anxiety or if I get anxiety because of them.

Every single day, up until tonight I lived in fear of something doctors, friends and family told me was very common and nothing to worry about. I refused to exercise, eat too much, and basically engage with my life on any significant level out of fear of producing palpitations.

But I just found this article that explains not just what causes them, but why they happen on a biological and physiological level. NOTHING has ever managed to set my mind at ease like this; from snooping on here I've noticed a lot of you have anxiety about them and I urge you to read this: [http://www.nomorepanic.co.uk/articles/palpitations](http://www.nomorepanic.co.uk/articles/palpitations)",19,2016-09-05 09:18:25 EDT-0400

112,[Success/Work] I left the job that was causing daily panic attacks and just got an offer for a new one next week!,"Edit:  Whew!! I'm sorry this is so long!! 

So I just realized this today...but it had been a while since I was on this sub (I'm sorry, I still love and support you all)...the correlation was I left a job where I was at my boiling point. (After writing this all out, it feels a bit cliché so I apologize but I hope it helps someone!)

This job was a terrible night schedule in which I was not able to have a social life, I dealt with awful customers daily and by the end of the day, I was completely emotionally and mentally drained. I spent Friday night worrying about Monday; my weekends were wasted in my mind. My relationship suffered tremendously and I ended up going to the doctor and a counselor for my anxiety as I was scared it was turning into depression. To sum it up, spending 40 hours in a toxic environment can be devastating both mentally and emotionally. I realized my limits had been pushed so I set out on a job hunt.

I managed to get a job, albeit lower paying, and was so excited about it. I had a panic attack on the 5th day and left. I got another job within 2 weeks where a co-worker told a story that fell into 'sexual harassment'. Left day 1. I was feeling *so* down, as up until this point I had not been unemployed in years and it was very out of character for me. I had never gone into an interview where I had to say ""I am jobless"". I was so far out of my comfort zone. I cried to my SO telling him how sorry I was to put this burden on him, but he is my rock and I attribute all of my motivation to him.

Being unemployed with anxiety was a new and strange beast for me. At one point, there were just so many worries financially that I completely broke down and slept for about 3 days and finally I just snapped and said ""Fuck the world, I'm finding a fucking job"" (easier said than done). I buckled down and promised myself I wouldn't accept anything less than what I am worth. While this was expending a ton of my energy, I couldn't continue to watch my SO work 80 hour weeks while I sat pantless all day on Reddit. I sent my resumé to dozens of people in higher up positions that I respected and got lots of feedback. I cruised Indeed, Craigslist, ANYTHING for about 3 weeks. Then I started reaching out to people and my luck changed.

I finally had an interview with a FANTASTIC company in a great position. It took about a month for this job to get back to me. All other jobs looked so pale in comparison; I had my heart set on it. Never mind sitting and picking apart literally *everything* I said during the interview- every day I sat refreshing my e-mail, watching my phone and my anxiety was absolutely off the charts. They set timelines which were not met and while I want to say I sat waiting patiently, I couldn't. I finally reached out to them after 2.5 weeks and basically just asked if I was still being considered. To my surprise, I was. (relief). About a week later, I got a call with the job. I literally had dreams about this moment. I quickly called and cancelled 3 other interviews I had lined up in the next 2 weeks. It is not customer-related at all and while I still have a few days of freedom to go, I am so excited to feel like I'm worth something again.

**All in all of my experience:** When looking for jobs while employed, everyone continued saying, ""Make sure you have a job lined up before you go onto the next one!"" and while I do agree with that- everything is a chance and sometimes that chance is worth your mental well-being. Had I saved the funds properly, I would have left far earlier than I did. You could have a job lined up and have that one fall through and fall flat on your face again, like I did. Or you could move on and flourish. 

*No job is worth your health.* Do not be afraid to take those chances- but be smart about it. The only advice I have if you are in a similar situation is to have money to last you for a few months. Continue through to make sure that you will not have financial burdens while job hunting as that is where most of my anxiety has (and still) lies. I hope that this next job doesn't cause too much anxiety and I hope this was able to help someone. If you've read this far- thanks for reading :) xx

**TL;DR:** Left job that induced anxiety daily, fell flat on my face after 2 failed jobs and finally have a new one in which I had my heart set on and fingers crossed will be minimal anxiety.",6,2016-09-04 22:32:22 EDT-0400

I've even had a doctor/surgeon question if I was autistic because I got so anxious that I just didn't say anything at all. At that point they started suggesting special needs surgical centers..

116,I just went out in my pyjamas,"At first I thought everyone would be looking and staring at me, and for the first few steps I really thought I'd made a big mistake (cue the running back inside). I eventually decided (through the all enveloping fog of pants shitting terror that we all know and love); that if anyone did go through the lengths of telling me I'm stupid - being outside in my pyjamas. Any sane, rational person would think they are an asshole.
It was just a short trip, I only went about 500m to get some coffee. But I feel like it was a step (albeit a small one) in the right direction. The waitress even said she liked my pyjamas, which was an odd, but pretty cool thing to hear.

I do live in the city though, so I wouldn't have to deal with so many people I know, but in my experience it's something I'd recommend for other people to do - to make some baby steps away from these inner demons controlling how we live our lives.",16,2016-09-04 17:33:38 EDT-0400
117,Procrastination and cleaning/organizing,"Hi. 

I need to clean up and organize a room. Every time I try to start I get overwhelmed and ignore it instead. 

I clean up garbage and stuff so it's not anywhere near hoarding levels. It's more that I have a ton of random crap that I don't know what to do with so it ends up just sitting in one spot and living there. I know there's tons of advice on clutter/organizing and all that.. and I know I could use it.

The problem is that I have an all-or-nothing attitude that makes breaking large things down into manageable chunks very hard. 

So instead of being a reasonable adult and maintaining a clean environment by doing like.. 20 mins of work a day... I'll avoid it for half a year, spend an entire day deep cleaning until there's not a spec of dust anywhere.. and then rinse and repeat 5-6 months later.

This also doesn't really organize things either. Stuff just gets migrated into either a box, some shelf, or somewhere else. Just glancing right now I see: a tube of fish food for the goldfish I have not had for over 4 months, a heating pad from when I hurt my knee, a roll of paper towel, a relaxation cassette tap from the 80's, a tape measure, 3 cans of condensed air for cleaning computers (actually relevant and useful, but somehow I ended up using all 3 at once so now I have 3 of them), a CD with drivers for the Dell computer we had 10 years ago, a photo album that somehow ended up living next to the compressed air cans... you get the picture.

Logically, I know what to do to clean up.. just start SOMEWHERE. I just hate the idea that I'll probably do what I always do and just shuffle everything around or stick random crap in boxes. 

Please tell me others deal with this bullcrap. It's an eyesore, it stresses me out, and it makes me feel so incredibly stupid because it's NOT ROCKET SCIENCE on how to fix the problem...

But somehow I still end up taking one look and thinking I'll start on it in an hour.

I decided to set aside 20 mins a day at a specified time to force myself to just start on it.. because otherwise I just keep avoiding it until I snap and clean everything in a 5-6 hour time span. 

What is silly is that I have pet birds and I have no problem cleaning their cage weekly and doing all the daily maintenance required.. it's just when it's random crap that somehow my brain chemistry malfunctions and I suddenly don't know what to do with anything.",24,2016-09-05 00:47:03 EDT-0400

123,I automatically assume people hate me? How do I stop,"Hey guys so some back story to this,

During primary school everyone would mistreat me, no matter how much I cared or respected a friend, I was always that.. 'Friend' the annoying one, or the one everyone excluded. I never really new why. Everyone just happened to treat me like that.


Fast forward to high school I finally had manage to get a group of friends, there was about 8 of us, we were little trouble making boys, and then one day I went to school and all of them hated me, they all started talking shit randomly. All because one of them spreaded a rumour about me and the whole group sheeped him. He said shit like I was using them, I stole his girls, said so many things. Of course everything he said about me was made up.


Soon after everyone, everyone in my year level knew about it and I had no one to hang with, and even though it's been 4 years now since that happened, everytime someone gets a little angry at me or when my friends joke with me on Facebook posts (saying insulting jokes)  and random people like their comments i auto assume the person who likes their comment hates me. And they're spreading shit about me. 


Or when someone tells me that 'this person' was talking trash about me, I assume that person had told a heap of people and their group hates me.


I don't know how to stop assuming that everyone hates me once one person does.. How should I come about this problem? Usually when I hear something like that I get kinda angry and it ruins my whole day.. thoughts like what did I ever do to you? :( 

tl;dr 
I assume people hate me over the smallest things, and that once a person talks shit about me, I assume everyone who they tell will hate me as well. Very paranoid about that. Idk what to do to diffuse my feelings towards people talking trash about me ",7,2016-09-02 17:13:43 EDT-0400
124,My anxiety is getting worse. I'm losing my job and I'm scared I'm not going to be able to support myself.,"I've had bad anxiety since high school. I used to be too anxious to get out of bed, I missed so much school I had to do make up days just to get credit for my classes. I had the same issue, only worse, in college. I ended up dropping out because I was just wasting loan money and failing. 

I now have an apartment and I'm finally supporting myself. I'm happier than ever and I have a fairly easy and enjoyable job, but I just found out I'm going to be laid off for budget reasons. I have one week. 

I've lost other jobs due to my attendance issue also, and this is the first job I've ever been successful with. I just had one of the worse panic attacks I've ever had when I found out about the lay off. I grew up very poor and in an unstable household, and the idea of not being able to support myself is terrifying. I finally have security. I can pay my rent and bills on time. I can eat when I'm hungry. and now I'm losing that.

I've been job hunting online all night and I keep having to stop and breath for a moment so I won't panic again. Every job I find sounds daunting in relative to my anxiety. I feel like such a failure that I can't do simple minimum wage jobs. I know I'm strong and competent, but sometimes I just can't do it and I hate myself for it. 

I can't apply for disability because my anxiety hasn't even been diagnosed yet. Even if it was, disability where I live required that your anxiety must have been preventing you from working for the last 12 months (what the hell? If I hadn't been working for the past 12 months, why would I suddenly need money to survive now?).

What do I do? I'm absolutely desperate and panicking. I really don't want to get on daily anxiety medication, I've seen what that does to people.",8,2016-09-01 12:04:17 EDT-0400

I do not trust myself to drive with how easily distracted I am, I am also terrified of driving.

My only excuses are gender related issues I've been having since I was 19 and that I'm autistic and bipolar. But there are transgender autistic bipolar people with anxiety who work and contribute so I really don't have any excuse. People say it's all in my head and it's all about attitude and I'm starting to believe them.

138,Remembering why I stopped posting on Facebook.,"So yesterday I took a reluctant return back to Facebook after about a year and I immediately regretted it.

So first off, I'll explain why I stopped using it, firstly it was adding to my depression, I am definitely not one of these people who sees their friends doing awesome stuff and gets inspired to get their shit together and do the same, I just ruminate on how much of piece of shit I am, not so much anymore though. I also find overly happy people annoying above all else, I am not sure why but it just bothers me, maybe it's because I cannot for the life of me understand how someone can be so content. But it was also because it was a major point of anxiety for me, I would refresh my feed to see if anyone would comment or like and I would feel weird answering right away to I would wait 10 minutes or so and then comment and a bunch of shit, that in retrospective, is stupid.

Well yesterday I made a post addressing the people complaining about Game of Thrones spoilers. I, in summary, said that the people spoiling a major plot point are arseholes but the people who are complaining should really know what to expect as the current season is five or six episodes in and whenever a new episode comes out there are always the same people complaining about spoilers. Now I may have been a little more abrasive and more generous with my favourite swear word, cunt, but that was the gist of the status. Now I thought it was not only a valid point but also a tad funny, apparently not, some people were legitimately mad.

My therapist encouraged me to be more myself in public and I am trying to be more active both on FB and Reddit but it seems I can't be. I honestly feel as if I can't be myself around my ""friends"" other than a select few. I feel as I should dilute myself and be less confrontational with my opinions but that wouldn't be true to me and I have lived too long with a mask.

My best friend got married last summer, and everything was going wrong on the wedding day--I helped keep her calm and kept things flowing. I moved almost 2,000 miles across the country and didn't shed a single tear or have a care in the world...until two weeks later. I've had *many* people tell me I'm someone they would want around in a crisis. 

I could give a million more examples, but the gist is that I rarely feel anxiety in the moment when big things are happening. It always comes a few days or even a couple of weeks later. Then it's at a point where I have a hard time connecting the anxiety to the thing that triggered it because I'll be in the middle of doing something benign and start freaking out for what feels like no reason. 

Does this delayed reaction thing happen to anyone else/ any idea if it's normal? It's almost like I turn the feelings off in the moment, and then they pop back up later.

I've started replacing people with animals, though. I have two budgies, and a rescued homing pigeon that's un-releasable, and at my parent's house I have a dog that was given up because of behavioral problems and a cat that was a stray kitten that's an indoor cat now. I feel like I'm ""saving"" them and that their affection for me validates my existence. I'm obviously not turning into an animal hoarder (had the cat for 8 years, dog for 3 years, small birds for a little under a year and the pigeon for two weeks after months of consideration) but I wonder how healthy it is to be doing this. My social anxiety is from fear of people acting unpredictably because of my dad's severe alcoholism in the past. Animals are straightforward in a way I find comfort in. If I pet my dog the wrong way, he nips, if I take him to the park, he'll be excited. Maintaining the animals' health and taming them also helps take my mind off of things. My budgies used to be terrified of people but now they'll fly into your hands for treats.

I think about what conversations we had, word for word, and dissect what I said as being unforgivably obnoxious. Even online.

I think this started with people telling me I didn't read social cues easily, so now I take every facial expression as meaning I'm overstepping my bounds and being annoying. Because of this I'd rather just be by myself and not talk to anyone, most of the time, even though I crave social interaction. 

I feel this has even spilled over and is affecting my relations with people I am close to. I talk very quietly in general and when they ask me to repeat myself I get very flustered and assume what I said was ridiculously stupid and say it doesn't matter anyway.

And given that that waiting period is usually quite long, that anxiety has time to build up and up, so that by the time it's my turn, I just want it to be over.

I have 90% of the time a severe nervous tension in my chest, especially when I breathe out. I just get a sudden burst of panic, no matter the situation, and it's fucking exhausting and I hate it so much. I worry constantly about everything to the point of not functioning properly. I set myself stupidly high goals (I have a list of a large amount of things I have to do every day to get myself to where I want to be, but what happens is I do them for a few weeks then get burnt out and depressed for weeks) and I know I shouldn't but I can't help it. If I don't, I feel worthless and like I'm wasting my time. I've basically stopped messaging people on social media and so on because I feel like it's taking up too much of my time, but I end up spending a lot of time on there anyway, idling flicking down, ignoring my friends. I feel so fucking guilty about it and it weighs down in my mind all the time. I feel like I'm losing all of my friends, but it's always just easier to not message them or not go out. I've had a few traumatic experiences in my childhood, but I've only really started being like this after a specific traumatic incident last summer. I didn't believe that things like this could really happen, especially not to me (I guess that's a common feeling), but after this event I just haven't felt normal. I've never gone out with anybody and I feel like I never will because I'm not attractive and because of my cycles of putting pressure on myself to spend all of my time ""wisely"" I never have time to put into people. There are very few other gay guys around me, which makes it impossible really to date. Being gay actually hasn't really caused any anxiety for me.

This often happens when I  go back outside after a meal, after socialising.  It is colder on the street, but the shivering feels excessive.

165,"Tonight, I just need to tell someone","I'm currently laying in bed, it's 2:00am where I am right now, and I just need to talk about this. 

I was diagnosed with panic disorder (a type of anxiety disorder) two years ago. For the most part I handle my symptoms pretty well. Like any disorder, there are good days and bad days. Tonight just happens to be a little rough. 

I usually sleep with a light on (except when I am at school with my roommates or I am staying the night with my SO or friends). I usually sleep with my closet light on because I hate the shadows inside it. Within the last year I have gotten in the habit of sleeping with another light on too. It's usually a little lamp, but I recently started using my salt rock. Tonight, I am also sleeping with a set of string lights that are hooked to my bed frame. 

I am afraid to look in the two mirrors that are in my room. I hate looking at my reflection in the mirror at night. I also just hate looking at mirrors at night. I don't really know how to explain this, but I get really anxious every time I look at them when it is night time. 

I am also afraid of looking at my door. It's currently shut, but I also hate looking at it. It makes me feel anxious too. I also can't sleep with my back turned to the door. My bed is in one corner of the room, and the door is basically in the opposite corner. 

My dog sleeps in my bed with me, which helps because if there were an intruder into my room he would wake up. But if an intruder were to break in to my room and harm me, my dog couldn't stop him. He's a tiny dog, and I would hate for anything bad to happen to him too. 

I know this will be completely ignored, and that is totally okay. But I just had to get my thoughts somewhere tangible (in a sense). I left my journal across the room and stepping my feet on the floor and around the bottom of my bed frame freaks me out too. I know there is no one under my bed, but I hate leaving my ankles at any thing's access I guess. 

What is horrible is that I am a psych major. I have been learning the  ""ins and outs"" of anxiety disorders, so I know the science behind what is going on. I logically can tell you that what I feel does not fit the context of my situation - I am safe, I will see nothing but myself in my mirrors, and nothing but clothes and boxes under my bed and in my closet. But I can't help it. ",6,2016-05-19 10:24:19 EDT-0400

178,Common cognitive distortions that feed your anxious thoughts.,"Here is a list of “Common Cognitive Distortions” from the 2012 book *Treatment and Interventions for Depression and Anxiety Disorders* by Robert L. Leahy, Stephen J.F. Holland, and Lata McGinn.

My therapist gave me a copy of this list, and told me to familiarize myself with all 12 cognitive distortions. I’m supposed to label them whenever I catch myself doing one in real life (ex: I just used emotional reasoning). He says that putting a label to it will help you to distinguish between what is a cognitive distortion (read: your anxiety) and what is rational/legitimate. It keeps you from letting your anxiety take over your thinking. 

I was surprised about how many of these I do! I do pretty much all of them. I do “blaming” the least, but I catch myself doing using these cognitive distortions countless times every day. 

Which ones do you do? Try to hold yourself accountable! Put a name to your anxiety, so that you can help control it! :)
Here’s the list:

1.	**Mind Reading**. You assume that you know what people think without sufficient evidence of their thoughts. “He thinks I’m a loser.”
2.	**Fortune-telling**. You predict the future negatively: things will get worse, or there is danger ahead. “I’ll fail that exam” or “I won’t get the job.”
3.	**Catastrophizing**. You believe that what has happened or will happen will be so awful and unbearable that you won’t be able to stand it. “It would be terrible if I failed.”
4.	**Labeling**. You assign global negative traits to yourself and others. “I’m undesirable,” or “He’s a rotten person.”
5.	**Discounting positives**. You claim that the positive things you or others do are trivial. “That’s what wives are supposed to do- so it doesn’t count when she’s nice to me,” or “Those successes were easy, so they don’t matter.”
6.	**Negative filtering**. You focus almost exclusively on the negatives and seldom notice the positives. “Look at all of the people who don’t like me.”
7.	**Overgeneralizing**. You perceive a global pattern of negatives on the basis of a single incident. “This generally happens a lot to me. I seem to fail at a lot of things.”
8.	**Dichotomous thinking**. You view events or people in all-or-nothing terms. “I get rejected by everyone,” or “It was a complete waste of time.”
9.	**Blaming**. You focus on the other person as the source of your negative feelings, and you refuse to take responsibility for changing yourself. “She’s to blame for the way I feel now,” or “My parents caused all of my problems.”
10.	**What if?** You keep asking a series of questions about “what if” something happens, and you fail to be satisfied with any of the answers. “Yeah, but what if I get anxious?,” or “What if I can’t catch my breath?”
11.	**Emotional Reasoning**. You let your feelings guide your interpretation of reality. “I feel depressed; therefore, my marriage is not working out.”
12.	**Inability to disconfirm**. You reject any evidence that might contradict your negative thoughts. For example, when you have the thought *I’m unlovable*, you reject as irrelevant any evidence that people like you. Consequently, your thoughts cannot be refuted. “That’s not the real issue. There are deeper problems. There are other factors.”

180,"It really hurts when you post a comment on reddit, feeling confident that you won't make yourself look like an idiot, and then you actually do feel like an idiot afterwards.","Late last night I was doing my typical 2-3 AM reddit browsing/gaming, when I came upon an interesting post in one of my subscribed subreddits (I'm kinda scared to name it/be detailed about it). The post was a about a laptop that I happened to be curious about, being a computer guy. The OP had posted a link to an image gallery of their newly-acquired laptop, and I looked through it in awe.

Going further, one of the images had the laptop placed upside down on top of a desk, with two batteries on top of the laptop. Both of the batteries were the same brand as the laptop, so I assumed they were both designed for simultaneous use in the laptop, since I actually own a similar laptop with 2 batteries, with the same manufacturer but a different model.

So then I posted a comment on the reddit post, complimenting with how impressive the laptop was, and I then proceeded to post the voltage, current, and wattage details about the two batteries as the initial image was upside down, thinking it would help save peoples' time.

Fast forward about 12 hours, I get back on my computer and go straight to reddit, and see that I have unread messages in my inbox. Now, most of the inbox replies I've received have been stuff like ""Thank you"" for helping others or just general, non-hostile comments. So I felt reasonably confident whenever I went to read my inbox.

Unfortunately the negative had hit me. Two replies was about how one of the batteries was actually for a different laptop model, and that's when I felt the negative ""I'm such a fucking idiot"" thoughts struck me. I can't remember what the contents of the third reply were as I was desperate to get away from them, and delete my comment that I had posted there. Then I started blankly staring at my computer monitor and could feel my hands shaking a little, and started heavily breathing.

It depresses me. I'll probably start getting scared again when I get inbox replies. I was doing so well up until now. :(

Granted, over time, the anxiety starts to develop on its own, but for me, there was a direct cause->effect relationship.  It just astounds me how that was missed by nearly every doctor.",16,2016-01-18 17:36:37 EST-0500
192,I forgot how to walk past people. Help?,"as the title says, i honestly ""forgot"" how to walk past people on the sidewalk or at school or anywhere for that matter. i conditioned myself to always look mad because it helped with my anxiety. for some reason i feel like i have to make eye contact with everyone i walk past and because of this, most of my encounters are awkward. 

most of my anxiety roots from how my facial expressions are perceived by others. if it makes sense, i worry about the way i smile. it stems from a popular yogurt shop that i used to work at for about 3 years where i was forced to conversate with anyone and everyone. i spoke to a therapist and she helped me a lot on how to not get so anxious but the thought of smiling ""weird"" is always in the back of my mind. 

so my question to you r/anxiety is how do i relearn how to be calm and not worry so much when passing other people? i want to be able to be normal again. i feel like because of my angry face, i look unapproachable. i also dont want to feel like i have to make awkward eye contact with every person i cross paths with. i want to change this in order to expand my social circle and to better myself.

I don't know how to process this except that my heart feels shattered and I'm extra paranoid about my husband- or others close to me-driving.
My absolute worst fear is losing someone from a car accident, and the worst part is that my friends were good drivers and I feel that this was a freak accident, and a total, unnecessary loss, as they were only doing 45 mph. ",15,2016-01-17 22:07:03 EST-0500

I caused it? That i made this happen for being 'weak'?

207,Do you find that your anxiety varies greatly on a day to day? Some days/weeks you just have a high baseline anxiety for no obvious reason?,"I've been learning of late that unfortunately when you think you're past the anxiety, it seem to come back in waves. You'll have weeks were you feel very low anxiety, then weeks were you feel very high anxiety, with no real reason or explanation why.

So say when you feel low anxiety, your baseline is say a 0 or a 1, and doing an anxiety inducing event may add 4 to that point bringing you up to 4 or 5 out of 10.

But when you have high baseline anxiety, you're a 3 to 4 pretty much resting and an anxiety event raises that to say a 7 or 8 out of 10. 

So on the 'low anxiety' days you can do anxiety inducing events, but on the high anxiety days you're pretty much a wreck before you even start and feel dizzy, lethargic, upset stomach, tension headache etc just by doing nothing.

Its incredibly frustrating and I don't know what creates such a variance.",41,2016-11-22 12:07:25 EST-0500

210,Does anyone else feel like a horrible person and get anxious and constantly dwell on bad things you did?,"I am always having this. I feel like everyone will ""find me out"" and think I am terrible or mean. Like a couple semesters ago I called some guy a loser in class jokingly (because he wasn't in the same study program as the others in our small project group were, so I joked ""oh the loser of the group""), but immediately after I realized that wasn't a really funny joke and was incredibly rude and I felt just awful for weeks on end. And I know I come off as being mean sometimes because I'm not very talkative or emotionally expressive and am sometimes sarcastic. I always feel guilty for every little thing I did. It is a constant source of anxiety that people will all realize that I am horrible. I know this isn't an excuse, but I used to have just terrible social anxiety so my social skills are somewhat stinted and I just don't know what is good to say and what isn't. I sometimes don't even realize that things are rude until well after I say them. Like I commented someone looked tired one day, and I found out later that that is considered rude to say. It seems so obvious in retrospect and I just feel like a mean person.

211,"I'm constantly worried about the future and I feel like I'm wasting my time, and I feel like every decision I've made is the wrong one?","Hi everyone, this is my first post so I'm sorry if it's long, I've posted some questions at the bottom if you want to skip a little. I admit I'm pretty nervous to talk about all this, so bear with me. 

I'm a first year university student and I feel like my world is sort of falling apart. I've been stressed about choosing the right program, and I do like (I guess?) what I am enrolled in as of right now, but this is where my thoughts always spiral. 

I know I'm very lucky and extremely privileged, as my parents are fully supportive and are able to pay for the cost of my undergrad degree. I don't want to come off as trying to rub it in people's faces, I'm just writing this down for some background info. However, this causes me extreme stress as I feel as though I am wasting their money pursing a degree that I may not want to continue with in the future. 

I also feel guilty because I've been finding the workload pretty intense, so I've had to quit my job I've had for two years, and I feel like I'm not putting enough ""responsibility"" on myself if that makes sense. Sure I'm going to work during the summer, but I feel like I'm kind of taking the easy road, and my grades have fallen a lot (going from low 90s to 70s) despite me having more spare time to study. 

I feel like my life is going nowhere, which I know sounds dumb for someone in first year, but I'm always afraid that I'm not smart enough or putting enough effort in and screwing everything up. I get pretty anxious at night which keeps me up, and this feeling only slightly subsides during the day. I have these thoughts pretty much every day, and I tend to worry about everything anyways so it's really exhausting. 

I'm not sure if I regret the choices I've made (quitting my job, my program choice, the school I went to) or if I'm being irrational. I'm feeling pretty hopeless about everything...

My mind is always everywhere and I'm not really sure if I should ask for help because 
1. I wouldn't even know what to say? Or who to go to? A family doctor? 
2. I feel like there are others who have it so much worse than me and have real stressors in their life, that I feel like I'm kind of being a whiny child. 
3.I feel like I'm kind of a lost cause because nothing is really wrong in my life, looking from an objective standpoint. I have it good, so I don't really deserve to be sad/ stressed? I'm not sure. 
3. How do I know if I have anxiety? I've been feeling this level of stress for a long time, probably since the end of grade 11, but it's only recently where I've pinpointed it down to school as a major cause. Usually I'm just anxious about everything, is there a test that doctors can do on me?

Oftentimes they come on completely by random, for no real reason at all I get this horrible hollow feeling that shoots through my body and I start to feel detached from my own ""self"", some sort of weird disassociation that sends me spiraling into panic that I'm dying right that very second. Honestly, as a human being it would help me to even have someone reassure me as not being insane in feeling this way but if anyone has any advice for how to deal with this, I am all ears because I feel like I'm losing my mind ",27,2016-11-27 07:17:02 EST-0500
213,How do people talk so much?,"I always find it so hard when I'm around big groups of people to speak up because I feel like there is nothing to say.

I couldn't blather on for very long on any subject, I feel like I just get to the point and leave it there. And when I listen to other people talk it's like I don't even know what they're talking about because they're not saying anything important, just saying something to say something. How can I stoke the flames on good conversations? (Without sounding like an awkward family member)

If it helps to know I'm in a frat, so I'm surrounded by outgoing guys all the time.

This happens even if I know someone is likely in a place where they might not be able to answer their phone and is especially stressful when it occurs with people I am close to. My guess as to why this happens (at least for me) is because I have had multiple instances or people not responding or completely ignoring me when they were done with me and wanted to leave me behind.

216,Excited to spend Thanksgiving alone.,"Going to spend Thanksgiving alone for the first time since moving here. At first, I was a little stressed out because my plans fell through and I didn't have plans anymore. Then it hit me - I didn't have any plans. No pressure. No waking up early. No pretending to like food that I don't really want to eat.

I'm going to wake up whenever I want, cook and eat whatever I want (still Thanksgiving food but more of what I like and less of what I don't like!), and do whatever I want. I get to be alone! I will probably spend the day cuddling my dog, playing video games, and maybe taking a short hike. My dog will also be getting a special Thanksgiving meal of fresh meat and veggies.

We feel so much pressure to celebrate birthdays or holidays like this, and a lot of the time it becomes a source of anxiety and expectations. It becomes less of a holiday and more like a chore. We should let ourselves have a real holiday from time to time.

Rumination was killing me for the last 3 months. It was intense, every day, since I was opening my eyes in the morning. My therapist told me about the possibility of taking drugs, and I totally agreed with that from the beginning. So I started to see a psychiatrist to help me with this issue.

24 hs after taking the first half pill, the intrusive thoughts disappeared. The second realization was that I could remember things faster. My eloquence came back and I stopped mixing words when I am talking.

I became pro-active without thinking about the tasks so much. Things I was avoiding all the time because I was thinking I was lazy, I can do it right away. Even it works with people, normally friends or family. I don't want to avoid them anymore with silly excuses.

The most important part is: I can see the canvas of the future again and draw on it my dreams and projects one more time.

226,What has helped my anxiety,"I’m not a doctor. Simply compiling everything that’s been helpful for my anxiety and wish someone had told me this information years ago. I’ve posted this on a few other threads but wanted as many people to see it as possible. Apologizing in advance for formatting and length. But please give it a go. Some of the information could be really helpful!

Background: Got diagnosed with GAD and OCD a while back and have been dealing with anxiety as far back as I can remember. Was on 10mg of Lexapro once a day for a year and a half. While it helped me get through some really tough life shit, the withdrawal, in my opinion, was not worth it. However, this isn’t the case for everyone so do what feels right for you! Anyways, here’s the meat:

1) Diet 
-Cutting out processed sugars and starches has made a huge difference. I've noticed that when I consume said foods, my anxiety ""brain fog"" and depersonalization/derealization gets significantly worse. However, starches can be hard to give up completely. As a fellow carbosaurus, I understand the struggle. I found that replacing white bread with wheat bread has really helped. Wheat pasta is a good substitute too, and there isn’t (in my opinion) a huge taste difference. Also, brown rice instead of white rice. White rice has a high glycemic index and can spike your blood sugar, which leads me to my next point -->

-Low blood sugar can play a huge part in anxiety. Snacking on protein rich foods every few hours can help this. I carry around a bag of bulk cashews to snack on in case I can’t access other food. Most grocery stores now offer those one-serving packets of peanut butter and almond butter, which are so convenient to carry around with you. Slim enough for a pocket even!

-Speaking of sugar, even artificial sweeteners (Sucralose, Saccharin, etc.) have been shown to heighten anxiety. These can be found in diet sodas, low fat foods, gum, and even dairy items to name a few. Honey or agave nectar can be good substitutes. BONUS: Consuming local honey exposes you to allergens in your area, which can help with allergies!

-Eliminating all beverages except water. Caffeinated and/or sugary drinks are basically the devil when it comes to anxiety so I'd cut back on those if it's hard to eliminate all together. 

-Alcohol and other drugs can cause anxiety to soar. I've noticed after a night of drinking my depression and anxiety sky rockets.

-Daily Omega. I take two Omega 3-6-9 blend fish oil pills every day and can notice a difference if I don't take them for a week. 

-Magnesium glycinate supplements have been said to work for a lot of people. Be careful though because certain magnesium supplements can cause explosive diarrhea💩

-There’s still debate on this one but salt. Apparently in the refining process of table salt, it gets stripped of minerals and trace elements. Pink Himalayan crystal salt contains 84 minerals and trace elements. Some people even add a tiny sprinkle to their water bottle every day. If you want to try this, be careful not to overdo it as salt can cause uncomfortable bloating.  

2) Meditation CAN'T SAY THIS ENOUGH 

-No exaggeration, this in combination with a fixed diet has been my savior. I feel so good I can't go back to living without meditation. 

-You don't have to be a guru hippy Mother Earth child to benefit from meditation or even learn how to meditate. There is an app called Headspace that provides excellent guided meditation highly recommended 

-Another user told me about an app called Breathe. From what I've read it's provided people with relief and is a great meditation tool. I’d recommend looking into both Headspace and Breathe, as people will always have a preference.

-Guided meditations are great but it's important to know how to meditate in silence as well (you won't always have access to your smart phone for a meditation app). When I do this I set a timer for 10 minutes on my phone. I'll take five deep breaths (in through nose, out through mouth) and then close my eyes on the last breath out. Begin to breathe normally. I'll then focus on my breaths, counting to ten, and then start back at one. Side note: It's okay to lose focus! And tell yourself that when you realize you're not counting breaths anymore. ""Oh, my mind went off track and that's okay. I'm going to focus on my breaths again"" and resume counting. I've been meditating for six months now and still get sidetracked frequently.

-Simple breathing. Whenever I feel the anxiety/nervousness/worry/etc. increasing, I'll go to the bathroom or another private place where I can sit in silence and count my breaths. This works as a good checkpoint through out the day, as I can try to ""refocus"" my mind.

3) Therapy 

-Yay therapy! I’ve been in therapy for the past 13 years. It has literally saved my life countless times. Therapy is beneficial for EVERYONE, especially those of us who suffer from anxiety. 

-I know some people have a hard time fitting therapy into their schedules or due to financial reasons (right there with you). A quick google search of ""best online counseling services"" ought to do the trick.

-Not sure how it is in other countries but in America most colleges (and probably some high schools) provide free counseling services. These are real counselors and legally cannot contact your teachers, peers, or employers. Also, if you are nervous about your peers seeing you at the counseling center, think about that for a second. You are seeing them at the counseling center. Chances are they are also there for counseling. This can create an immediate and intimate bond between you guys, and maybe even someone to talk to about what's going on in your head. 

-For those afraid or who get anxiety about going to a counselor/therapist: Therapists are genuinely caring people. Most of them became therapists because they themselves have struggled with some sort of mental illness and/or a traumatic event. And they are legally required to maintain the integrity of your conversations, meaning they won’t talk to people in your life or others about what you say. Everything you say is confidential. (That is unless you talk about harming yourself or others). I cannot stress how wonderful it feels to have someone in your life whose sole purpose is to listen to you vent about your feelings. One of our basic needs as humans is to feel heard. When we get that need met, we feel acknowledged and loved. This can mean all the world when it feels like no one in your life listens and/or understands the intensity of your anxiety. 

4) Journaling

-Bring that pen to paper and vomit out all of your fears, angers, frustrations, sorrows, etc. Sometimes our anxiety gets stuck, and when we give it an outlet, it can make all the difference. 

-Writing virtually is good but I’ve found that the act of physically writing out my emotions is so meaningful, and I feel a higher connection with my mental and emotional body.

-In a previous thread I posted this information in, some people mentioned they didn’t like reading their emotions because it made them feel guilty, angry, etc. It is okay to feel these emotions! BURN THE PAPER. Seriously. Burn. That. Shit. Up. Tear it up. Watch it go through a shredder. This is therapeutic! Feel like I have to say this—make sure if you do decide to go the burn route that you do it outside in a receptacle that can handle the heat! 

5) Podcasts 

-There are a number of very helpful anxiety podcasts. I'd recommend The Anxiety Coach's Podcast. There are two new episodes each week (Wednesdays and Sundays) that somehow relate to anxiety. The host provides listeners with MANY tools for helping with anxiety, as well as an extremely diverse range of topics. I've found that even episodes I don't think apply to my anxiety have always consisted of useful information and helpful tricks.

-Other good podcasts include Anxiety Slayer, Anxiety Guru, The Anxiety Podcast, and The Anxiety Guy. Just like the meditation apps, give them all a try! If you don’t like one you’ll probably like another one more

6) Exercise 

-GO OUTSIDE. Studies have proven time and time again that even just sitting in nature and hearing the sounds it has to offer lower cortisol levels (stress hormone) 

-Yoga. Any type is beneficial! I've found the most anxiety relief from Restorative Yoga. The whole class consists of three poses (they aren't super complex yogi stances, usually lying on your back in a certain way) 

-Cardio is great for ""happy"" hormone production. 

-It's important to note which types of exercise make YOU feel good, as it's not the same for everyone. For example, running is great for you but if it's physically hurting your knees, ankles, etc. it's probably not the best for you. There's always a different form of exercise, and fortunately all types of exercise result in decreased anxiety! Any type of movement is better than no movement when it comes to anxiety :)

7) Medication

-Anxiety can be fucking torture. There is nothing worse than feeling like a prisoner to your own mind. Medication can definitely help soften this, especially if you are feeling like you can no longer go on.

-Research your options. Talk to people you know who are taking something about what they like/don’t like about being medicated. Read reviews. Read side effects (this might not be helpful if you are extremely prone to the placebo effect or have health anxiety).

-READ ABOUT WITHDRAWAL. Once again, I am all for medication if you feel it is right for you. When I decided to go on Lexapro, I was 100% sure I wanted to. What I do regret is not researching withdrawal. Not only did I experience two weeks’ worth of physical symptoms (night sweats, racing heart) but also experienced severe depression and anxiety that was far worse than what I’d experienced before going on it. I also have social anxiety now which I didn’t have before. Anyways, the point of this is to research, research, research, and know your options!

- ""You Are the One"" by Kute Blackson is an inspirational read for anyone with anxiety 

-Posture makes a difference. Sitting up straight builds self-confidence and becomes easier with time 

-Write down quotes or phrases or mantras or whatever makes you feel good and hang them up in places where you’ll see them frequently. Bathroom mirrors and inside front door are two really good places I utilize regularly. You can even write down reminders of why you’re working on your anxiety.  

-PM me if you ever need someone to talk to! I’m in the process of becoming a therapist myself so please please please contact me if you need to talk. I will not judge you and love to listen. Anxiety doesn’t need to be a social taboo. 

It's important to note that working on your anxiety is a process. There's not one thing that is a magic cure-all. You'll have great days, weeks even, and then not-so-great days. It's crucial to remember that the down days don't last forever. And as a reminder, be extremely gentle with yourself. It is okay to feel other emotions besides happiness. This may sound weird but welcome them. Allow them to be. The more you resist them the harder and stronger they’ll come back. 

Once again, please feel free to PM me if you need to talk/vent. Best of luck to you on your journey and thanks for reading!",83,2016-11-18 08:19:46 EST-0500
227,LPT: Googling anything is bad for Anxiety,"I don't know why it's taken so long for me to figure this out. But even googling certain situations that have nothing to do with health anxiety, can make my anxiety much  much worse. There are so many possibilities that you can find on the internet and most likely, none of them will apply to you or your situation. Especially those worst case scenarios. 

So I'm gonna try to not google things to 'help' my anxiety and see how it works out. ",26,2016-11-18 21:47:52 EST-0500
228,My teacher perfectly described my social anxiety without even realizing it,"Well, I was in class. Some people were talking about how much they ""hate"" their part-time jobs, and as I was thinking that at least they can have a job and not be miserable, my teacher basically brought that up. It was kinda out of the blue. But here's what she said:

""Well, I mean, there are some people with social anxiety who just can't do those sorts of things. They really want to spend time with people but it has to be on their own terms. And then, because of that, they have to be alone a lot of the time and it makes them really sad.""

And the whole room just fell silent. I'm sitting there, staring at nothing, letting all of it sink in with me, trying not to cry. But that's the first thing that's given me a feeling of actual sadness in a long time. So that's good.

Anyways, it was a weird and depressing experience. And I felt really frustrated afterwards, but I'm not really sure why. Maybe I was mad at myself, or maybe I wanted to stand up and raise both hands and say, ""Yup, that's me."" I think it was just hearing my own thoughts out loud that got to me that most.

But yeah. Just thought I'd share.

229,I just want a normal mind..,"The best way I can describe my thoughts is a bunch of people trying to talk over each other, thousands of ""what ifs"" ""whys"" ""hows"" who's"" all jumbled together one trying to be louder than the other.

I wake up in the middle of the night sometimes covered in sweat with a pounding heart and rushing thoughts. I honestly feel like it's driving me crazy sometimes

I don't know how to Turn. It. Off. I just want to be normal.. its so exhausting having so many unnecessary thoughts. It causes stress beyond proportions.

I'm only getting 3-5 hours of sleep a night.. I can't understand how I've not snapped yet.. there's just so much build up from my thoughts. I wish I had an off switch. My first response would be ""ahhh"" relief. I've tried explaining to my fiancé but it's probably hard to understand something you don't experience. The best way I explained it was when you over think, but only it NEVER goes away.. there's always something I'm obsessing about that causes stress, but I can't turn my brain off.. I don't know how to stop..

236,"Social anxiety, even on the internet.","I'm feeling brave today so I'm gonna ask you something that keeps popping up in my mind. It might be a bit long, so thank you for giving me a few minutes of your time.

I'm a long time sufferer of anxiety. I remember being a child and having the same feeling in my stomach as my anxiety gives me now. Back then I called it a tummy ache and it's been with me ever since. I never had many friends when I was a kid. I was slightly bullied (the way girls do, by just freezing you out).

I suck at social interactions and have a really hard time connecting with people (unless it's about to become a real, sexual relationship. I can do those. I CAN connect to my family as well). I have (had?) friends but my anxiety combined with depression makes me isolate myself and I leave my friends on the outside of my bubble. I don't reach out to them because I don't want to bother them and to be honest I don't have the energy to do shit in real life right now. I'm working on getting better and it takes a lot of my time. 

Anyways, most people with social anxiety seem to be able to make internet friends. I've never been able to. I can't get over the fact that people online are actually real people with real thoughts and feelings. I need to talk to people other than my SO and my closest family, but I'm too afraid to. I want friends tho. I want people to talk to that I enjoy talking to instead of trying to figure out what they really think of me.

Anyone who knows what I'm talking about? Or does anyone have any suggestions on how to make some nice internet or real life friends? I've played MMOs but I never talk to people on there either. I always feel like I'm the odd one out when it comes to other people and I just don't know how to reach out...",28,2016-11-20 21:54:42 EST-0500
237,My service animal was refused entry last night.,"I have a service dog (psychiatric medical response) and she was refused entry when I tried to go to a bar to meet up with friends. I've encountered establishments before that didn't have full knowledge of ADA law but were more understanding once they realised, but this is the first time I've actually had a place refuse my service animal because it was ""bad for their business"". They were really condescending about it too and honestly didn't give a crap whether it was discrimination or not. 

I argued for a long time. I've already filed an ADA complaint and written on their social media pages. It gave me so much anxiety that I couldn't sleep until after 6 AM, but I'm proud of myself for standing up for my own rights and against discrimination. 

Edit: She IS a service animal. I have anxiety but that isn't what she is trained for. I know ESAs aren't covered by the ADA. 

Edit 2: I was avoiding having to explain why I need her, but apparently people really want to know. She is a psychiatric medical response service animal for panic attacks. I have a long history of panic attacks (since mid-teens) stemming from violent trauma issues from my childhood, which is both a mental and physical event. I've been told it's PTSD but I don't get flashbacks, just panic attacks and intrusive thoughts. I have had to admit myself to the emergency room/urgent care for the severe ones. Now I have daily medication on top of emergency, strong prescribed medication, and my service animal, who is trained to deal with me during my panic attacks. I try to carry my emergency medication with me, but it becomes less effective with more use and is known to be addictive, so I am not given a lot of it. 

People were very concerned that I was trying to be vague to the establishment. I wasn't. I told them clearly what they can ask me and offered them time to read up ADA laws. I would've happily told them what she is trained to do. They just didn't care because they didn't want to let her in either way. She is very well trained and well behaved. She goes with me everywhere and staff regularly comment on how they forget that she is even there (which is the goal in public).",46,2016-11-21 01:03:44 EST-0500

240,I think ive finally accepted that I need to go back on prozac,"For several years I took 20 mg of Prozac for GAD and OCD. It helped wonderfully, but caused me to gain weight and virtually took away my ability to climax. In March of this year, I decided to stop. I was newly married and wanted neither of those side effects. Plus, if I wanted to have a baby in the future, I didn't want to be on the medication.


But Lord I didn't realize how much the Prozac helped me. Since stopping, my anxiety is in high gear once again. My periods are awful and come with significantly more depression than they did on Prozac. My IBS is once again terrorizing my stomach. I get dizzy, out of breath, nausea, sweaty palms, and racing thoughts. I took the absence of these things for granted for those years on Prozac. I forgot how bad it can be.



So I have an appointment set up for a new GP to go over this laundry list of concerns, and I think I'm going to ask about starting Prozac once again. The weight gain and sexual dysfunction is better than thinking I'm going to die everyday (hyperbole). I also am on a waiting list to start seeing a therapist who specializes in GAD/OCD with exposure therapy, since I've had CBT in the past and it didn't work much for me.



I thought I could handle this on my own, but as more days go by I realize that I can't. While I feel pretty shitty right now, I at least feel good that I'm moving in the right direction.

I can't seem to win and was fed up, customers are possibly even worse and just get pissed off and I really can't stand the looks they give me, just right in front of me there.

My friend who works at a grocery store in town also says the employees and customers treat him like shit, probably even worse, and I just feel like it's not worth it to work at a place, even part time, where everyone treats me like shit.

245,The Most Important Thing You Need To Remember When Your Anxiety Sets In,"I don’t think anxiety ever goes away. At least, for me it doesn’t. Maybe there are some #blessed people out there who have figured out a magical way to defeat their anxiety once and for all. But for most of us, there’s no cure. There’s no mountain you climb, or bridge you cross, so that you can get to the other side where you’ll be free from worry and fear. It’s more about learning to deal with anxiety when it comes, and learning to treasure those beautiful moments in time where it’s temporarily absent.

A life plagued by anxiety is one of racing heartbeats and fast breathing. Your shoulders often feel heavy and sometimes you’re almost sure that you can see a dark cloud hanging over you. There’s a strange fear that doesn’t seem to stem from anything specific. It’s just fear. It’s just there. 

Sometimes you can’t enjoy a nice, peaceful train ride. Or a trip to the movies with your friends. Because the minute you sit down, you’re forced to be with your own thoughts. They start running around in all different directions. You’re thinking of possible dangerous scenarios, or things that have caused you anxiety in the past. Or you just feel scared for no reason at all. It just happens, and you wish it wouldn’t.

It’s worse in the winter. So much worse. The days are short and the weather is cold. It seems like it’s always dark. The small amount of sunlight we experience during the day doesn’t even feel like sunlight. It just feels like a strange and brief phase of the day that will be over quickly. Darkness will descend in no time.

This is when it’s the hardest. When everyone feels cold and bitter and cranky and cooped up. We can’t distract ourselves with light breezes and bright colors. We can’t walk around outside for hours and free ourselves from our own heads. It’s winter. Everything is dead and gray and muted and cold. This is when your state of mind and your way of thinking can either make you or break you.

You have to acknowledge that you probably will not defeat anxiety. You don’t need to focus all of your energy on “fixing yourself” or finding a cure. Stop making yourself feel like there’s something wrong with you. Stop making yourself feel ashamed of your anxiety. Stop being frustrated with yourself. Just because you can’t beat anxiety doesn’t mean you’re letting it win.


Yes, you’re probably going to have to deal with it for the rest of your life. Not all the time, of course. Sometimes you will have incredibly wonderful periods of time where you don’t have any anxiety. You can go days without it. You can go months without it. Sometimes you will go years before you have to deal with it again. But often, regardless of how long it’s been, anxiety will find its way back to you. You do not have control over the cure, but the beautiful part is that you do have control over how you handle it.

The most important thing you have to work on is your state of mind. When anxiety starts to take over, it’s tempting to give in to your thoughts. To let yourself crumble under the fear and the worry and the terror. What you have to remember is that you’re not alone. You are not by yourself. You may feel like you are the only person in the world to ever feel like a prisoner inside their own mind, but you are not. There are so many others who have been where you’ve been, but they eventually got free. Not free from anxiety, necessarily, but free from the dark way of thinking that anxiety can cause.

A lot of people struggle from anxiety. Not everyone, but enough people to show you that there are others who have gotten through this, just like you will. You’re struggling now. You’re terrified now. You feel alone now. You’re telling yourself it will be okay. You’re telling yourself you will get through this. You’re telling yourself you will be stronger when you come out on the other side. But you have a hard time believing it. That’s okay. As long as you’re trying to believe it, as long as you are wanting to believe it, those thoughts will carry you through the darker moments. And eventually, they will start to make sense. They will start to seem possibly true.

A lot of people will give you a lot of different advice on how to deal with anxiety. Some of it will work for you, and some of it won’t. Some of the things that do work for you will not work for your friend or your coworker. Everyone is different. Everyone’s mind is different. So everyone will deal with anxiety a different way.

Here’s what you need to remember: there’s a lot of advice floating out there about dealing with anxiety because so many people have had to deal with it. So when you’re feeling ashamed or frustrated or exhausted or embarrassed about your anxiety, just remind yourself that you are normal. You are not a freak. You are not the only person in the world that has ever been this terrified. A lot of us are fighting it. A lot of us are scared. A lot of us have had bad nights that we didn’t think were ever going to end, just like you have.

You are human. Which means you will get through it, just like so many other people have. You will not defeat it forever. But you will learn how to be okay – and more importantly, how to be happy – in spite of it. ",17,2016-11-15 17:40:44 EST-0500
246,DAE take a sick day off of work to avoid going in late (would it count if I get panic attacks from this)?,"Due to my general anxiety I tend to get little sleep, I've been classified as an insomniac and this has led to other conditions such as depression and suicidal thoughts. On the off chance I do get to sleep for the night, I end up oversleeping and going right through my 4 alarm clocks. I take sick days off instead of going to work late to avoid facing my bosses/coworkers thinking I'm just a lazy sack. I will have a panic attack for most of the morning trying to sort myself out because I overslept and I don't want to lose my job especially since I started to get my life on track. Granted, I know my boss or coworkers wouldn't mind much, since I'm the first one in and last one out (managing a database for the state). But I can't help but feel like I'm letting them down just because I slept in an hour late for something I don't have much control over. I apologize for the wall of text, I don't know who else to talk to about this (I'm currently sitting in starbucks for the whole day so parents don't know).

It's like they don't understand what it's like to have to (metaphorically) crawl through barbed wire every single time you want to get something done. That's insanely difficult. 

Sorry, I just needed to vent.

254,I'm not afraid to post anymore!,"I've had major anxiety that I dulled for many years through a horrible drug addiction. My biggest problem when I would get clean would be all of that anxiety coming back to the point where it would be hard for me to even order food from a drive through. So this time I began working on my self-esteem and I think I am making progress! I quit smoking cigarettes, started working out a little, and having small conversations with strangers or store clerks when I get the chance. I realize now that a lot of my social anxiety came from feeling alienated due to social stigmas placed on drug addicts.
    
I have been a long time lurker on Reddit and always afraid to post or comment. I would often begin to type things and then be afraid. I had such low self-esteem that I was afraid of what people over the internet would think of me who couldn't even see me! I'm proud to say that this past week I have been able to speak freely on here without getting nervous at all! I feel bad for those struggling with this as well but remember that it really can get better if you work hard at it.

259,Tip: Simple but maybe this will help,"This may or may not work for you, I wanted to get that out of the way first off because not everything works for everyone. This is just something I have been doing lately and it has helped me so I wanted to share.

In those times when your anxiety is overwhelming and you're pacing the floor trying to get a handle on yourself, it's ingrained in us to try and calm yourself down by repeating, ""I'm OK. I'm OK."" The problem is you're not OK, not even remotely, and this has always caused my panic to rise because it's not magically making be feel better and I'm not calming down. The more you focus on *not* calming down, the worse it gets.

I've changed it to ""I'm *going* to be OK."" which allows me to know that right now might suck and I'm having a hard time, but it' *is* going to pass and eventually I *will* be OK. Distract yourself if you can, but keep that mantra in the back of your head. Allow yourself to acknowledge that this shitty thing is happening, but it *will* end. Don't fight it - that will only exhaust you, ride it out as much as you can. This doesn't always work, sometimes the attack is just too damn strong, but give it a shot.",19,2016-02-10 20:25:10 EST-0500
260,Telling this girl I'm done with her shenanigans.,"Backstory: I'm a 17 year old male. She's also 17. I asked her if she wanted to see Star Wars one week after it came out. (8 weeks ago) we planned to see it then that night she had to cancel. We rescheduled it for the next week. She canceled again. We rescheduled the next week for noon (I work evenings starting at 5 pm. She knew that) then she sleeps in until 2. I told her it could still work as I have freedom to be a little bit late. She decides it's not worth it then cancels again. Then as I get to work I check Twitter and can see she tweeted ""I just want to watch Star Wars"". I'm quite upset as she's making it look like my fault that we hadn't seen it. Then we scheduled to get lunch in two weeks (about a month ago at this point). As you probably guessed she canceled again. My mom tells me just to be done with her. I don't because she's the first girl to seem interested in me. The girl and I schedule dinner this time since I had the night off. She cancels 45 minutes before and it was getting late so I can't go with any friends. Then this weekend she came to me to schedule lunch today (Saturday) and she cancels because she doesn't feel well. I then see on her snapchat story that she is with friends. 

I'm now realizing that my mom was right about her. How do I go about telling her how I feel and see that it really hurt me without seeming rude?


Update: I did it! It feels great to be able to stand up for myself for once. She was talking to a mutually friend saying I'm being dramatic(even though I gave her 8 2nd chances). I feel like I dodged a bullet.",27,2016-02-14 04:50:53 EST-0500
261,Most of the day I live in an imaginary world and it's interfering with my performance in school and everyday life in general,"I've always done this. When I was a kid I used to dream about being a part of the Harry Potter world. Back then it wasn't really a problem, or it wasn't bothering me. But now, it's becoming really annoying.

It's completely ridiculous. Right now I'm kinda alone so I mostly imagine a reality where I have a boyfriend. I'm having conversations in my head, arguments. Sometimes I imagine meeting his parents and reacting to situations that might occur. I imagine their personalities, what they think of me and how they react to me. 

Sometimes it's my friends or people I know, sometimes it's some famous people I'm currently interested in - again, detailed conversations, situations.

The reason this is a problem is because I can't control it. It's too satisfying to be in this imaginary world that I just can't resist it. I can't pay attention in class, longer conversations with other people turn into me saying ""Can you repeat that?"" every couple of minutes. Studying is almost impossible - I actually failed this semester because I wasn't able to do a single exam. Before I go to sleep it's probably the most intensive, sometimes I have trouble falling asleep because I think too much.

I'm going to see a therapist this Thursday but I fear I might fall back into an ""apathy state"" (which happens quite often) that basically makes me say fuck it, and during that time I'm not bothered by anything. If I was to see him right now I would say exactly this but I won't be able to in a couple of days...

Does anybody have a similar experience? What can I do to stop living a life that doesn't exist?",30,2016-02-14 19:03:21 EST-0500
262,Just wanted to share my SO's beautiful reaction to my anxiety attacks.,"The day before yesterday and into today I had one of the worst, and longest, anxiety attacks of my life.  You know, the one where it feels like your entire chest is wrapped in plastic and you feel like you're suffocating.  You put your fingers under your nose to make sure you're breathing, and you are, but if feels like you can never get enough air.  My boyfriend is laying next to me, completely asleep, but stirring because I keep crying because I am so damn frustrated that I can't calm down, or breathe, or sleep, for the second day in a row.  

He gently tells me to get up, puts on music, and puts his arms around me so tightly, and sways me back and forth.  The entire time he's quiet, except for ""I love you"", and ""I am always here when you need me"" in my ear.  None of that ""just calm down, it's all in your head"" bullshit I've heard from other relationships.

That was a true act of love and I'm still floored.

Have any of you had anyone so accepting of your anxiety like this?",25,2016-02-11 06:49:15 EST-0500
263,Amazing results from magnesium,"I have suffered anxiety  all my life,  I am a 26 year old male medical student.  I have used and abused a lot of substances,  nothing seemed to work.  Well two weeks ago I started on  chelated magnesium.  Within 4 days i felt amazing like i  have never felt before.  So while researching, I found out that almost 80% of us are magnesium deficent! And are people prone to anxiety,  the constant anxiety depletes magnesium at a rapid rate.  So for all of you who are nt supplementing this essential nutrient,  please consider it

270,[Success story] [F/22] My experience on Sertraline (aka Zoloft).,"Hi guys,
Up until last summer I had pretty severe anxiety. Not going to go into details, but life in general felt like wading through a river full of pirahnas, even though on the surface things were pretty good.

So I went to my counsellor to ask for CBT and whether I should go onto meds, and he said yeah, I should try both. So I did.

The first week on sertraline at 25mg, I felt so ill, dizzy, nauseous, anxious, everything, that eventually I called quits on my whole life, built a blanket form in my room with my xbox and stayed there for 3 days until I started to feel better. Then my doctor upped me to 50mg (as per standard procedure), which luckilly didn't make me ill again. 2 months later, I was feeling better, but still not brilliant, so my doc upped me to 100mg. Again, no significant illness on upping the dosage.

I have now been on 100mg for almost 4 months, and I feel 600,000,000x better!!! I can live my life without constant terror and mental exhaustion, my relationship with my boyfriend has been better than it ever has (my anxiety was driving a wedge between us), and I am having minimal side effects.

Side effects I am having are: 
1.) Increased UTIs -- not sure why, but in the first 3 months of going on I had 2 SEVERE UTIs within two weeks. This has settled down quite a bit, but I do get much more frequent twinges of pain down there than I ever used to.
2.) Intolerance of salty foods?? Also not sure why. I've never been a very salty person, but since going on I have found I really really can't stand very salty things. I suppose it could just be related to being more thirsty. 
3.) Derealisation -- This is probably the most noticeable and affecting me. I frequently have the feeling like I'm not really living my life, or that I'm in a bit of a constant dream state. I often have to think hard about whether a memory was real or a dream.  This would be freaking me out more if a) my anxiety weren't so low ;) and b) i know that it is directly connected to the meds, and that I'll go back to normal when I hopefully come off in another few months.

Overall, sertraline combined with some very successful CBT (I found that attention-training works really really well for me, and focusing on this is what I'm hoping will allow me to come off the meds) has changed my life, and after this stressful final year of uni I am very much hoping to hold on to these changes without the meds!!!

....Although I was just awarded a place in a great PhD programme, so not so sure I'm gonna be stress-free for the next few years ;)",13,2016-02-12 13:40:33 EST-0500
271,After 23 years I realised anxiety is ruling my life.,"I'm new to this sub, I've read some amazing advice and was wondering if you guys could help me.

I believe I've always been an anxious person, overthinking every situation and obsessing over the tiniest of details. I've had bouts of depression and other things. My anxiety, however, boomed when I hit puberty- I didn't want to go out, I felt odd, unaccepted and would constantly flake on people.

I fought back for a while- I went to uni, made friends, graduated and got a good job. Now something happened at this job, I started to swallow really hard and loud. I was nervous being in an open office with new people. This hasn't stopped and I've been here a year. The past three months it's started to happen at home. Some days I'm in agonising pain and have to take my dads prescription acid tablets.

I've tried ignoring it, calming myself down, making noise to mask it but it's got to the point where it's causing acid reflux, swollen throat, lack of saliva and nervousness around people when drinking/eating.

I want to go to the Doctor, I want to work a way around dealing with this but I have no idea what to say or what to expect?

Any advice would be greatly appreciated!",17,2016-02-09 17:30:50 EST-0500

I try to take it one day at a time, but with anxiety my worry often takes control and i get anxious about the future and if I'll always be strong enough to get through it forever.

I quickly backed away from the vehicle and called my step dad to come pick me up. Cops were called.

I'm now terrified to leave the house. All it would take is him driving by my house while I'm checking the mail or smoking a cigarette to know where I live.

277,I got my drivers license!,"I am 33 years old and have been terrified of cars my entire life. I can't believe I actually took my drivers test, let alone passed it! Sorry, I just wanted to share with someone who would understand what a big deal this is. I can't believe I did it!

Edit: Thanks so much for all the support, I didn't realize how many people have anxiety about driving. A lot of people have asked questions about how I got over the anxiety, how I made myself take the test, etc. My biggest fear about driving was that I would confuse the gas and the brake. That did happen once, but I was able to correct it, and hasn't happened since. It very quickly becomes second nature.

Second, driving really isn't as scary as you think. Everyone on the road is a person, everyone makes mistakes driving, but you can quickly correct the mistakes. Its okay to make mistakes sometimes, just stay alert enough to notice and fix the mistake.

Third, you just have to do it. I swear, your fear is worse than driving. I was absolutely terrified of driving, I just got home from my first time in the car by myself. It really is okay.  And driving is so freeing, I had no idea what I was missing out on. Please please please, just try it. ",48,2016-07-01 19:37:06 EDT-0400

290,"Recently, I feel like i'm becoming less intelligent.","Wall of text incoming(?)


I just don't understand it.


I've always been a good student. Straight A's all throughout elementary and middle school for as long as I can remember, other than the 7th grade. Got A's in all of my 9th grade first semester finals, finished first semester with 1 B, 3 A's, and got 2 A's and 2 B's for second semester finals. Finished second semester with all A's. I plan to always take honors, which is something I've been doing, or possibly go into AP courses.


I'm moving into 10th grade now, but it was around when I had second semester finals that things just felt... different. 


At the time, Spanish II was one of my courses. It was easily the most stressful out of all, English is my native language, and there is just something about learning a new language that is difficult for me. 


It was a few weeks before finals when things began to be noticeable. I would walk into my classes, mainly Spanish, and I just forgot. I didn't know what some words meant, even some obvious words, it felt as if half my vocabulary had vanished out of thin air. Not to mention that paying attention in class was difficult as well. I tried my hardest, but it all felt as if I was in a dream. Words that I should obviously know, I didn't. 


Now, it also feels like I don't know as much of my native language, English. I used to be an avid speller. I would enter spelling bees all the time throughout elementary/middle, all the way up to 8th grade, and I'd always place. Now, it seems much more difficult to form words and sentences. Words that I should definitely know how to spell, I don't. Sometimes, when I read, I just completely don't understand what the passage is saying. Sometimes, I'll have to read over something several times in order to fully comprehend it, which is something I never used to have to do.


Now, it also feels like I'm losing grasp of basic concepts. Just a few moments ago, I was looking at 3 handed clock, and I just completely forgot how you're supposed to tell time like that. I didn't know what the numbers represented, what the hands represented, or anything. I was able to recall the memory after a few moments, but I've never had that much trouble trying to recall such a simple concept that I've known basically throughout my entire life, and what should be known as common sense.


I'm afraid of the 10th grade now. I'm afraid that things won't click, that I won't be able to understand and comprehend, or even remember concepts that were taught.


Now that it's the Summer time, I thought that I could just relax and not notice a change, but as time goes by, it just feels more and more prominent. 


If anybody has any insight, or any words/opinions, they are all welcome. I can use any thoughts that anybody has.

I have been off of Paxil for about a year ( no reason other than the prescription ran out and I seemed to be doing OK). Lately my memory and concentration are just shit. I have like 45 open excel documents right now with partially done things and my boss came over here and I told me to do a really simple small task and I wrote it down word for word on my hand to keep from forgetting after asking her to repeat it twice- I'm sure she thinks I'm an idiot. I work 8 hours a day and I have no idea how I spend so much time getting nothing done. 


I've noticed this memory/concentration problem occurring as my anxiety seems to be on the upswing again. The last time I was on Paxil I felt like my memory and concentration were great so I was thinking about going back on it. I did a google search for Paxil and memory and apparently memory loss is a side effect? Now I'm afraid to get back on it because if anything makes me lose any more memory I will be drooling into a cup asking everyone to repeat themselves because I can't remember 5 seconds ago.

His behaviour is stressing me out SO much and although I love him, I don't believe he is in an environment where either he nor I can thrive. I love animals to death, but I've been having suicidal thoughts and severe, severe anxiety - I don't think it's worth it at this point. 

ANYWAY, 

I put up an ad online to try to find him a loving home, because I don't want him to end up in a shelter. I mentioned the reason for getting rid of him was because of his behaviour towards my new dog (I didn't really want to get into my mental health issues on a public forum!) and some lady sent me this long, aggressive e-mail ranting at me because I am so ""cruel"" to re-home my cat. 

This person doesn't know me or my situation and chose to judge off an ad - and even took the time to send me a lengthy, rude e-mail on top of that!

Wanted to share a quick bit of advice I got from my therapist last week regarding my anxiety. A lot of my anxiety revolves around uncertainty and fear of losing control. I have a lot of what I've heard described as existential dread, and I've experienced agoraphobia and panic attacks off and on throughout my life at varying intensities.

Last week when we met she basically told me that just b/c something is uncertain doesn't make it bad. Very simple statement but helped me a lot this week.

306,Everyone is fighting their own demons. I won't be embarrassed by mine anymore.,"So be prepared for a HUGE wall of text. This isn't a throwaway account because I'm tired of hiding from this. Anxiety is a mental issue that people have been trying to bring to light (thankfully!). I would like to talk about my specific kind of anxiety. Everyone's fear, nerves triggers, and symptoms are different. Mine are very specific and I haven't attempted to get help until now. SPOILER ALERT: that was a mistake. 

My family has a history of gastrointestinal problems. Although I don't always feel the family legacy, there are plenty of times I do. Sometimes, when in public or around people who don't know about it, I'm not in the best position to understand the plight of my family. I've had bad moments in long car rides or in situations where a bathroom isn't accessible. I'm sure we've all seen those commercials. While it isn't nearly as common for me, I've create a fun game for myself.

Sometimes, when I was in a bad position, I would begin to panic that those few moments from the past might happen now. I'm almost predisposed for it. My mother still struggles to this day. It's in the stars that I'll have a life of struggling with gastro health problems. This has caused me anxiety for the last 12 years. It was very manageable for awhile...in fact, I barely knew that's what it was.

Anyone who has constant anxiety knows there are triggers (two to be exact). There's the first trigger that starts up the anxiety and ball of nerves you become. It could be a big test, a doctor's appointment, or being in large crowds. Then there's the second trigger that kickstarts your inevitable panic attack. That could be an answer on the test you actually don't know or a loud noise in the big crowd. It gets so bad you can actually see it coming, almost annoyed by its presence. Abdominal pains used to be my only trigger. Unless I was home or in a comfortable place, I'd start to get anxious and panic if I thought my gastro issues would show up. Left untreated, I developed the first trigger. Some PLACES would start to turn my stomach because I was afraid of what COULD happen (ex. cars, parties). If you haven't guessed, a car is my biggest trigger.

Now, 12 years later, I find myself with what I call pre-anxiety. It's that knot of nerves in the pit of your stomach when you have a presentation or job interview. I have a long weekend trip next week. Every time I think about the four hour drive or various aspects of the agenda, I get that knot. I can usually make it go away, but I know I WILL panic on this trip...and that makes me a nervous wreck. Trust me, I don't want to be THAT person. People with anxiety would give their left leg to make it go away. It's something we feel burdened with. I'm seeing a psychologist on Monday to discuss my trip and more professional ways to deal with all this. And it will be the FRIST time I'm discussing this with a professional (never wait until your anxiety is CRIPPLING).

For now, I'm here because I've created a villain in my own life. And I know I'm not the only one. I refuse to not only pretend it doesn't exist, but continue to be embarrassed by it. I have anxiety due to gastrointestinal issues. And I will beat it. ",16,2016-04-16 17:51:54 EDT-0400

308,"Robbed at gunpoint last night, need to vent.","Happened in the Netherlands, Amsterdam.

Last night I was with friends at the recordings of a local television show. When I was biking home to the student campus, I was on my own at that time, someone biked up from behind, stopped in front of me and took out a gun. 

I immediately stopped and raised my hands in the air. He wanted money so I gave him my wallet. There was 2,50 EURO in it so he asked for my pincode. I gave full cooperation while he also took my phone. I was forced to follow him and was told not to do anything stupid. We biked for about 2 km untill we got to an ATM. In the meanwhile he gave me back my wallet, asked me how much was on my bank account (answered I did not know) and said I needed to withdrawal 50 for him. 

At the ATM, I withdrawed the money and stupiditly also went for the reciept, which I hid in my jacket. He told me to follow him some more. Asked me where I needed to go (gave vague directions ""Campus Southeast, which there are more of). I asked for my phone, because I had cooperated (don't know why...) and got it, if I promised not to call anyone. 

At an intersection, he went left and send me right. Told me not to follow him, and that he would take measures if I did... I went right and biked for about 10 minutes before I had the guts to call my mother, a friend and 112 (police). 

Now, I have filed a report for street robbery, but also for being taken hostage. By law, it is forbidden to take someone, somewhere by force/threats by weapons. For a short amount of time, I was a hostage. 

I come by that area every single day. On the most diverse times. On tuesdays, it is around 3.45 AM for example. I am on the board of my study association so I often have weird schedules or events in the evenings nights. The road is basically the only one I can take without biking for 10 extra minutes and is not near much houses. 

Rationally, I think I am safe now. I was at the wrong place at the wrong time with the wrong person. However, emotionally, I do not feel safe. I keep checking if passersby are the culprit of yesterday and I'm afraid to go there. Today I went there when it wasn't dark yet, but it just does not feel right... 

I was lucky. The thief was utterly stupid (why ask 50 and not try to max it out) and the weapon was probably fake. However, I'm scared shitless... ",15,2016-04-15 00:25:34 EDT-0400
309,Feeling guilty for having anxiety and panic attacks,"Hello. I'm not sure how to jump into this so I guess I'll just go. 

I feel like I don't have an excuse to have anxiety and panic disorder. I know that probably sounds stupid but it's how I feel. My anxiety is mostly hereditary from my dad, and I feel like an ass over it when getting support. 

Whenever I'm looking at a post or an article or listening to an anxiety relief podcast or something there's always some backstory about a traumatic experience or abuse that led up to the severe anxiety. I feel like I don't deserve to feel bad, these people have gone through such awful traumatic things and here I am having panic attacks and anxiety despite the fact that my life has been perfect. 

I just can't shake the feeling that I don't deserve to feel bad or get help. I'm just broken by default and it makes me feel weak and selfish.",26,2016-04-20 13:30:01 EDT-0400

311,I made it through surgery without a panic attack! So proud of myself right now.,"I had outpatient surgery today on my sinuses. I have been nervous about this since the day my surgery was scheduled. This whole week my anxiety has been extremely high, to the point that I wanted to cancel. This was an optional surgery, but something that will help me feel a lot more comfortable so I really wanted it. This morning I was expecting to have panic attacks the whole time when I was waiting to get put under. But I surprised myself. My heart rate was 120 so I was clearly anything but relaxed. Despite that black pit of fear ready to consume me, I did it anyway. I stuck it out. I didn't panic. I am sharing this because I am damn proud of myself and I also hope someone else can remember my story the next time something scary comes along. I was terrified and I did it anyway.

312,I bought a bike today,"I've been meaning to buy a bicycle for a while now. I haven't ridden a bike for several years. I was extremely nervous about going to the store to buy one.

Yesterday, I spent an hour at the food court trying to work up the courage to go the store to buy one. I ended up walking into the store then leaving immediately after. I was extremely uncomfortable trying out bikes in the store and scared that other people would judge me.

I went back today right before closing. I managed to talk to one of the salespeople for 10 minutes and tried a couple of bikes. I ended up buying one and walked it home. It was very uncomfortable walking a bike all the way back to my place. But I'm glad I did it.",9,2016-04-18 07:19:50 EDT-0400

314,Another thumbs up for Magnesium!,"I used to work the front desk in a doctor's office where it was very high stress AND I have health anxiety. The combination ended up sending me on that lovely ride we all know and love on a daily basis. It wasn't until one of the doctors recommended I get labs drawn up. Of course I was low on vitamin D (living in the north west), but I was surprised to find out I was stupendously low on MAGNESIUM. This little bugger is responsible for helping in the function of over 300 systems in your body. Including your central nervous system. After my first 200mg, I felt the difference in less than 15 minutes. It was spectacular. I ended up buying a whole bottle and I haven't looked back since. I would say taking it regularly (200mg twice a day) has kept my anxiety at bay more than 80% of the time. As someone who's done the xanax thing, the hospital thing, the hermitting thing, and the full on avoidance of everything thing for about eight years, nothing has been more efficient for me than these tablets. I don't know if it will work for everyone, but I do know it worked for me. And if I can contribute to just helping one person away from this nightmare, this is totally worth sharing. 

Long story short: Magnesium glycinate helped me tremendously and I hope it helps some of you too.

315,My parents never took my mental health seriously but are different with my sister,"I'm 23 and live at home. My sister is 16 and in high school. 

When I was 18 I started having severe issues with panic attacks and anxiety, I had to beg my mom to take me to the doctors. I was never taken seriously. I tried to tell my parents and was simply called lazy or was told to get over it. I stayed in my room for almost a year because it was so bad. I would sleep till 5 pm. My parents never did anything for me. They never tried to help me. 

Recently my sister who is 16 has been having issues with her teacher at school and has told my parents she had an anxiety attack in class from it. My parents were instantly concerned about her and my dad told her that they will talk to the school about it and try and get her out of that class. She is going to the doctor today because she revealed to my mom that she was so upset she thought about cutting herself. She has only had 2 anxiety related issues and my parents are doing everything they can to help her. 

I can't help but feel full of rage seeing this happen. Nothing was ever done for me. I was never taken seriously. I have self harmed multiple times. I know it's good that my parents are taking her to get help. But I can't help but feel so mistreated and angry. I never got any support from them. 

Edit: 
Thank you for your replies. I'm happy to know I'm not alone in this. I am trying my best to not let these negative thoughts overpower me. I just can't help but feel so wronged by my parents. I have been writing in my worry diary every day. It helps but doesn't take away the feelings completely. I contacted the place I had a psychological assessment 4 years ago. They still have my record but they turned me away because my case wasn't urgent and it's something I have to go to my family doctor for. I finally want to get help because I feel scared and at the end of my rope. I want to talk to a professional about my problems. I was shocked when I was turned away. Does the noose have to be around my neck in order for me to get help? ",9,2016-04-18 20:37:49 EDT-0400
316,I'm afraid of ceasing to be and its destroying me,"I wasn't always like this. I'm not exactly sure what happened. I started college and would have bad dreams of death and would wake up, become depressed, miss class, stay in my bed crying for days but then it'll go away and I wouldn't think about death for days or months. 

Now it's every single day. Just pops up Into my head even when I'm having a good time. There will be a day I will die and I have no idea how I'll feel, won't feel. My body will be no more, just a shell and I'll decompose. The thought of that just scares me completely. It's the unknown that scares me. I grew up Catholic and let's say I'm not very religious now and it'll be hard to convince myself there's something afterwards because what if there isn't? I know if i die I won't know it I won't feel it but that's exactly what scares me. 

I guess I want to know if I'm not the only one and what people with a similar case do to calm themselves down. I'm only 25 but I'm driving myself insane with these thoughts. ",23,2016-04-19 07:43:36 EDT-0400

318,"Anxious on the inside, strong on the outside - Who else has this dilemma?","I was talking to my therapist about this and is quite true. I have anxiety probably daily (especially recently), yet I never truly show it in which you think an anxious person would. While chaos ensues on the inside, even on a physical level (like chest tightness, heart palpitations, dizziness, etc), on the outside I seem calm. Sometimes I feel like I'm going to fall over from being dizzy, but on the outside I'm engaged confidently in a conversation that I somehow get through. 


It's a blessing and a curse. A blessing as in I can actually seem composed, but a curse because, in a sense, it's a lie to not only those I'm around and communicating with, but to myself.",13,2016-04-15 20:15:36 EDT-0400
319,Hi,"I just subscribed to this sub as a way to face my fears about being anxious. 

I had a traumatic, very intense experience with anxiety a few years ago, and now I don't get anxious as often as I used to, but when I do, it really scares the bejeezus out of me. Feeling sick or just not like myself triggers it too. I have nightmares about it. 

I practice mindfulness meditation, I'm on meds and I have an amazing therapist. I'm in the process of learning how not to fight the anxiety and the difficult feelings. It's incredibly hard. It's hard especially because when I do feel anxiety, I try SO HARD to use all of my skills to get rid of it, while at the same time knowing that fighting it does not work. It's very frustrating and scary to be caught in that place. 

So anyway, hi, this is me trying to come to terms with the fact that yeah, I get anxious sometimes and yeah, I am imperfect and human and that's ok. All of you are too. It's ok not to be ok.

He goes on to describe how it will cause you to panic, your mind goes blank and you can feel like you're paralyzed.  

It hit me really hard hearing someone describe anxiety to people  outside of the context of an anxiety disorder.   That is what anxiety is suppose to be about and most people experience this in situations that usually warrant it.   But to people with anxiety disorders, this is what we deal with everyday is situations that are pretty normal to most people.  Sometimes you're just feeling the anxiety for no particular reason.  And it just really put into context how debilitating it can be and how much of a challenge it adds to our lives.

How wrong I was. You know what REAL MEN do? Real men take care of their responsibilities, and above and beyond all, your health is your responsibility. There is SO much help out there for you and SO many ppl willing to help you. Lifestyle changes, talk therapy, outreach groups, psychotherapy, medication, journaling, exercise, religion to name a couple. In my darkest hour I told myself that I needed to fix myself on my own or else I was weak, inadequate and a failure. I told nobody about my situation and internalized everything. I can tell you first hand, this gets you nowhere. Talk to someone. Vent on Reddit; message somebody (message me!), try bringing it up to your most trusted friend / family member.

I'm the type who never gets annoyed when someone shows me their photo album of their pet with 100 pictures in it :P

I have always loved animals and more importantly, I love caring for animals. Don't even care what animal/pet it is. If it's mine, a friends, or out in nature, lol.

I have grown up with dogs but currently have a rabbit and 2 fish and have been obsessive about making sure they are OK and always comfortable/not sick/bored/etc. I want to rescue so many more, but currently space and funds will not allow. I do what I can for now.

I was at the pet store obsessively deciding between 3 different types of foods and how happy it would make my fish. I think caring for my pets diverts my attention from my own health and I can project that into (onto?) another being. I may not be able to take the best care of myself, but my animals will be treated like damn royalty. I always thought it would be awesome to have an emotional support dog, but, for reasons above, I can't. For moments out of the day, I can get out of my own mind and focus it solely on another and it just feels so wonderful knowing they're happy.

Tell me about your animals and how they have (or haven't) helped you :)

I have dealt with anxiety since I was about 13. I can remember a time when life was easy, no panic attacks, no worrying. But, I was only a child. My anxiety has gotten much worse over the years. There are times when I feel okay and it isn't that bad, but recently it has gotten so bad that it is ruining my relationship. Me and my girlfriend have been together for about a year and a half.

She doesn't understand the anxiety. She gets upset and frustrated when I can't do things. Which sucks because that isn't what I want. Little does she know, I want to go out and do those things more than she does!! But I just can't. I'm letting my anxiety win, which is something I have fought for so many years to not let happen. I just recently came across the term agoraphobia. I read all about it, and I'm sure I have that too. I am way too scared to go to the doctor.

348,Who else feels depressed about their inability to maintain value in social environments?,"This is making me so depressed. Everytime I try to talk to people or do something normal for a change I can't help but notice how weird I am acting and behaving. This makes me feel like I have no value to people and that I will not make any friends or girlfriend.

It also shows how uncomfortable people are around me, because all the friends I make stop talking to me after a short period of time, and this is making me feel angry at myself, even though it's not my fault at all.

When it comes to girls it's even worse. Girls want a guy who isn't going to make everyone feel uncomfortable (obviously), and I fail to see how the f*ck i'm ever supposed to land a date when i'm so awkward and weird.

Where the f*ck are all my social skills? I wasn't always like this. I used to be WAY above average when it came down to socializing. I used to be a top level charmer. Now i'm literally behaving like i'm autistic.

Am I f*cked for life? If the answer is yes, i'd like to kill myself and get this shit over with. I can't take the humiliation even one minute longer if this is the way it's always going to be from now on.",9,2016-09-23 10:41:54 EDT-0400

Almost any time my phone goes off I think ""Here we go, they've discovered that I've done something wrong"" (I have my phone set up to recieve my work emails and communicate via text with my bosses when they aren't in the office, so every notification comes with a bit of anxiety, even at all hours of the night). It's the most absurd thing. Two days ago I knocked it out of the park with some things I was assigned to do, and even today I got an enthusiastic ""Thank you!"" text from one of my bosses who I helped out with a last minute thing, but now I'm frantic because it's 40 minutes til work is over and I haven't heard from my boss in over an hour, which isn't unusual, over a project that won't be necessary to discuss for at least a week. I'm partly frantic because I will be off all of next week, as will my bosses, and we won't be able to discuss anything and I'm afraid we'll all come back and realize nothing I was working on was correct. The craziest thing is that this week off is a reward for doing well and helping them outside of my regular duties over the past few months, yet I just can't shake the feeling that I'm going to make one of them mad and/or get fired.

360,My university dorm is telling people that introverts aren't good friends and i'm scared to go back.,"For a bit of context, I am in my first year of university. The school that I go to is fantastic, the people in my department of study are like one big happy family, and my professors are all super supportive (it’s a relatively small school, so we can talk to and get to know the professors well). 
I am the kind of person who really likes to support people when they need it. Since uni is full of stressful times for everyone I have been able to bond with a lot of people and we come to trust each other pretty quickly. I’ve been able to help a lot of people, and they help me too. 

I have a really good group of friends, but I am also a huge introvert, and have struggled with social anxiety for a large part of my life. Most of my friends know this, and they respect that, which I am always grateful for. They know when I just need to stay in my room instead of going out with them, and they know that when I am going through a rough patch and just don’t want to be touched they do other things for me like message me and send me things. Everyone at that school is so amazing, except my dorm mates. 

There are 16 girls in the hallway that I am in. With the exception of my roommate (who is really sweet and shy, and we get along really well), all the girls are very much the typical party-going, loud, preppy university girls. Not to say they don’t have their positive attributes, but in my experiences with them, the close-mindedness they possess toward things like other people, different life-styles, and respect toward personalities other than those that match their own has become very irritating yet constant aspect of my day. I have often wished that I could have gotten to know them before high school or something because they might have been nicer, but because that is not case, I don’t know them and they don’t know me. 

Now to the actual event that I am frustrated with. One day the apartment representatives decided to do a Q and A with my dorm about life in uni. (It’s important to note that my roommate had gone home for the weekend and was not here at the time) The questions were all anonymous and we just wrote them on little cards and put them in a bowl. Questions were asked like “How should I organize my room?” and “Why are we not allowed alcohol in dorms?”. I thought it might be a good time to ask a question, so I wrote down something along the lines of “What are some good actions to respect people of different personalities (e.g. extrovert vs. introvert)?”, with the hope that it was specific enough to find some suggestions, but not draw attention to the fact that I wrote it. I waited for a while, and thankfully my card was chosen. 
The answer was not as I had hoped.

The conversation that followed started with the dorm representative talking about the difference between being outgoing and being reserved, basically stating that outgoing people take more risks and tend to get better opportunities for success and have a larger group of friends, while reserved people are safer with their decisions but it makes them less appealing, less likely to find a fun career or get married, reclusive, and more negative. She said that when it comes to an extrovert being friends with an introvert, it tends to be the extrovert who carries the introvert through life because according to her, more reserved people don’t have the mental capacity to deal with social situations ‘that are vital to succeeding in life’, and often the introvert can pull the extrovert down, and it’s important not to let that happen. She said that as women, it’s our job to be the kind of girl that a man will find attractive, and if we don’t put ourselves out there then we will never be wanted. One of the girls asked out loud what they can do to interact with and better understand introverts (which I thought was nice of her to ask), the response was telling the dorm that if your friend is an introvert, the best way to help them is by trying to break them out of their shell by forcing them to go to parties, keeping them entertained in social settings, and introducing them to your friends because if the introvert knows more people, they will feel more comfortable. The question concluded with the representative saying that if the person does not wish to follow your attempts to make them more outgoing, they probably don’t have a positive influence on your life and you should surround yourself with people who will be more supportive of you. 

FML.

After that question I told my RA that I had to go study for an exam, and left before my tears were too noticeable. I walked back to the empty dorm and just sat and cried for a while. I had no idea that what seemed like a simple and helpful question would turn into the head of authority in the building telling everyone I am living with that all the aspects of my personality that I cannot change is a negative influence on everyone’s life and it should be their mission to either mold me into what they are, or to block me out completely. Before they came back, I thought it would be good to maybe talk to them about my point of view so maybe they can understand where I am coming from, but as I sat in my room and heard them come down the hall, the only topic I could hear through the door was about how good the advice was about how to ‘deal with all those shy people around campus’. I realized that I couldn’t talk to them, both because I felt ashamed of myself for apparently being something inferior in their eyes, and because I didn’t want to face them if all they would do is criticize who I am. 

Well the semester is over and I just got an email from my roommate saying she isn’t coming back to the dorm because of the unhealthy environment the other girls had created in the dorm. I honestly don’t know what I am going to do if one of the other girls moves into my room. The dorm has already become a stressful place to be for me because of them, and I don’t know how I will make it if my room (which has previously been my sort of safe haven because I can lock the door and block out some of the sound when I just can’t deal with people) is no longer safe for me to be. I hate this feeling, and while everything else makes me excited to go back to school next semester, I am actually scared to go back to my dorm. 

Edit: Thanks guys, I didn't realize I would get much response so soon. 
Thank you so much for the support, I did send an email a while ago about it on behalf of my roommate (who did confirm that she is not coming back). I also ended up talking to a friend on campus about it, and  have gotten some help from them. Although *some people* might not understand the importance behind this kind of thing, I appreciate all of you so much, even if my petty worries are the least of a lot of our problems. Thanks again :) ",25,2016-12-25 01:21:21 EST-0500
361,"I want friends, but I have no idea how to make them.","I've never been very good at making friends. Every single person I've become friends with approached me first. I have no idea how to make or join into conversations and I tend to keep quiet to people because of how self-conscious of a person I am. Very little people know anything about me, and this includes my own family. When someone asks me a question about myself, be it one of my interests or something about my life, I normally don't respond to them. 

I always feel lonely at school, but the problem is I have no clue on how to get people to want to talk to me. Not only does my appearance drive other people away, but whenever I *do* speak to someone, all I can do is stutter, mumble, and talk super fast. Plenty of the girls at my school share interests with me that I'd love to talk about, but I have no idea how to bring them up to people without coming off as incredibly awkward. Plus, I never want to admit any of my interests to people, anyway. Be it bands, video games, or what I like to watch on YouTube, I won't tell anyone anything about it. I've even started to become afraid to share things about myself with people on the Internet, which was something I never worried about before. 

I can't deal with the anxiety anymore. I am constantly scared of what others think of me and it's completely taken over my life. When I give someone my phone, I have to delete all the music and pictures I have on it beforehand. I can't buy things at the store, because I'm scared someone will see what I'm getting and judge me for it. I avoid other teenagers outside because I know they'll make fun of me if I happen to be nearby them. I've started losing my sense of self because of how many times I've pretended to like something just so I could fit in. I constantly think people are mocking me or are going to mock me and because of that, I never speak to people, which just ends up making me feel even more anxious and depressed. It feels like a cycle I can never escape out of. No matter how hard I try I just can't open up to people, even though I want to. ",28,2016-12-21 22:09:37 EST-0500

367,How to cope with intrusive thoughts about death/ existence/ meaninglessness,"A lot of anxiety advice is along the lines of ""don't sweat the small stuff"" ""just think about it rationally"" ""just gain perspective on the situation"" etc which I feel works for anxiety triggers that are related to work or leaving the house or social situations or whatever, but when you feel your worry transcends all earthly matters and is dealing with real truths of the universe it can be super hard to tell yourself it doesn't actually matter. 

My day is filled with near constant worry about the meaninglessness of life and futility of it all, and I'm really not sure how to deal with it besides from staying distracted which is very hard in itself. If I wasn't anxious and depressed and therefor felt pleasure as a normal person it would be easy to tell myself I should just live in the moment and enjoy the pleasures of life, but it's a viscous cycle where I worry therefor I never really feel happy/relaxed therefor I worry.

369,A few lifestyle changes that helped me beat my anxiety!,"I have been trying all kinds of things over the last year or 2, and i have just recently found a great point in my life where i am living anxiety free once again! I won't bore you all with a long story, but here are my most recent changes that have led me to become anxiety free and live a calm and peaceful life...

1. Caffeine Free Life - i haven't had any caffeine for about a month now and i love the way my body feels
2. B Vitamins - i have been using B vitamins to replace caffeine when i need energy, however cutting out even B vitamins has helped even more so
3. Meditation - i try to meditate at a minimum of once a week, but preferably everyday or every other
4. No Alcohol - i found that alcohol would cause my anxiety to worsen the day after consumption, so i stopped drinking it altogether
5. Cannabis - may not be for everyone, but i use cannabis legally in my home and it has had very positive effects on my life

That's all! 😊

Edit: I am not denying that cannabis can in fact CAUSE anxiety to worsen in some people. It helps me, but for obvious reasons it is not for everyone and i don't claim it to be.

Edit: For those interested, i also use a CBD Tincture on my bad days to help manage my anxiety without resorting to my xanax.",49,2016-12-22 21:44:03 EST-0500

376,UPDATE: I am 21 years old and I have a driving phobia. Today I faced my fear and took my drivers test.,"My old post from yesterday: https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/4y96lt/im_21_years_old_and_tomorrow_i_am_going_to_face/

If you are struggling like I am please read this (or at least skim) because I have some super-valuable-might-solve-your-problems tips for you. This is going to be long but I am just going to spill my guts on what Ive been doing for the past month before my test.

What a day. At times my heart was pounding, almost all day my palms were sweating. Sometimes I thought I was going to be sick. But I was there. And I did it. I took the test.

No, I didnt pass. I was so nervous that I made mistakes that I dont normally make, mostly dealing with observation. It wasnt awful. I drove quite well through most of it. I just happened to make 2 mistakes that were bad enough to make me fail by 4 points.

But I dont like using the word ""fail"", because I didnt. I did something that at one point I truly thought I would never do in my life. In that, **I succeeded**. And I am fully ready to dust myself off and try again. Now, some words of advise for people who are in the same position as I was.

Just GETTING to this point was an incredible challenge, and I had to do some very specific, and actually non-cliche things to get to where I am, mentally. I recommend doing all these things while your anxiety is being treated by a professional, whether that is just your GP or a CBT.

First of all, **stop looking at this as a success or failure thing, as though its really that simple for us**. Imagining yourself with only those 2 options puts too much pressure on you. Dont ever look at it like youve only got one shot in your life to take your drivers test, or that youve only ever got one shot in your life to be successful. Thats not true. You need to look at it as you simply doing a task that you need to do, like running an errand. Either you complete it today or you complete it another day. You dont fail/lose if you dont complete it today. Just take the action of doing it. If you dont get what you need to get done done then you can always go back and do it again, just like forgetting eggs at the store and having to make a second trip.

Next, I have a question. **Have you ever pictured yourself driving before, or does your mind always imagine you in the passenger seat by default?** Dont look at it as though you *belong* in the passenger seat, like its just some natural thing to you. Listen to me, you *can* drive. You have that ability. I mean that. Picturing yourself doing this is the most important step you will ever do in this process. You need to just close your eyes and picture yourself driving normally. No drama. Stop picturing some deadly crash, or embarrassing blunder. Which brings me to my next point.

**Write about it.** Cant picture yourself driving normally without bad things happening? Ok, heres what I did. On your computer, make a secret place to write. Nobody will ever know about it. Its your private space to vent. Write about driving. Write anything you want, but you need to find a way to put a positive spin on it. You need to end your writing with *something* about you achieving your goal. You can write a little story about you taking and passing the test. I wasnt able to do that, so I just settled with typing out the pros and cons of getting my licence, ending my little diary entry on the pros. I just really let my thoughts flow. I wrote everything I was thinking. It felt so good to let out these thoughts that, honestly, I was running away from and trying to ignore a lot (for the sake of not getting anxiety)...but, bottling things up creates anxiety of its own. You need to express your thoughts somehow. When your done writing about driving, read what you wrote back to yourself while doing calm breaths. Then just spend some time thinking about it. If you know how to lucid dream, I highly reccommend trying to dream about driving. That is part of how your brain processes things, and I think the trouble with anxiety is that sometimes avoiding an anxiety attack about something means you dont let yourself think about it, so you dont let your brain process stuff. Dreaming is literally designed for your brain to process different situations so this is a great technique.

**Anxiety will always try to fool you**. Listen, I know that car accidents happen, but your anxiety is making you think they happen way more often and to way more people than they really do. It blows up your perception of the likelyhood of something happening to you to extreme proportions. Stop looking at it as though something WILL happen. I IS good enough to say ""it probably wont"". You act as though saying ""it probably wont happen to me"" is you fooling yourself into thinking your safer than you are, but thats not true. Instead, you are fooling yourself into thinking you are in more danger than you are. *Live your life*. Dont be imprisoned by anxiety. Break anxieties illusion.

 Anxiety is tricky, because it puts us inside of an illusion. **You need to learn how to recognize when you are seeing the world through anxieties illusion, or through what it really is.** What a wonderful thing that we live in the age of the internet. Do not always assume the worst. I can assume that I will win the lottery tomorrow. That doesnt make it true. Instead of assuming, wouldnt it be smarter to look up the statistics of me winning and come to a conclusion based on that? I can do that with google. Information is so freely avaliable to us today. Allow yourself to think critically instead of emotionally when assessing risks. 

* There were 29,989 fatal motor vehicle crashes in the United States in 2014. The American popuation in 2014 was roughly 318,900,000. What a small number of people compared to the entire population! **Now think**. How many of those people were drinking? How many of those people were high? How many of those people were texting? How many of them were being dumb with their friends driving recklessly for fun? Guys....you have anxiety. Are you really going to do those things? We are so damn cautious. When you cut out all the people who were under the influence and being stupid for funzies, what is left? How many people got cut out of the number 29,989, out of 318,900,000?

**JUST DO IT.** This is for people who already know how to drive but are terrified of taking the test. Go to the DMV with someone you are close to and schedule your appointment even if you are completely not emotionally ready. Now, this wont work for everyone, but for people with anxiety who are big on deadlines this might be the push you need. Make sure you give yourself time to process your fear. Dont just say ""yeah, Ill take it next week"" if thats a completely unrealistic time for you to process things. For me, I scheduled mine a little over a month ahead. And, yeah, I wasnt sure if Id be able to process it in that time either but what matters is you are giving yourself a lengthy amount of time, but not so lengthy you think you might back out of it. Sometimes its good to put pressure on yourself. And you know what? If you back out you back out. But, you want to do this right? Just chance it and schedule the test....just to see what happens. Make sure you do all the steps I have talked about before if you do this.

**The day before and of your test, put as many other stressors behind you as you can. Dont you dare think about anything but happy/calm things and your test**. If you can put anything off for a day or two, you need to do that. (**This includes any thoughts of the future or ""what if?""s.**) Just do it until you take your test, then you can worry about other tasks and stressors when you are done. The trouble with anxiety is that we tend to focus on all our stressors at the same time and it overwhelms us. Well, just like some of us are able to avoid thinking about driving, you can do the same thing about any other stressor. Shift gears and ignore all stressors except for driving for a day. Again, Id like to emphasize that this does not mean do nothing but think about driving all day long. It just means that driving takes up enough stress in itself for you so you need to make room for it *should that stress come about*, instead of overwhelming yourself with everything at once.

**THE DAY OF, think about the fact that you have anxiety and are scared out of your freaking mind as little as possible** or else you will start making excuses for yourself and also psyche yourself out. Positive or neural thoughts only. If you arent sure you are going to pass, dont lie to yourself and say ""oh yeah, Ive totally got this"", because that puts pressure on you. But also dont think ""Oh god I am going to fail"". Instead go for a neutral thought that is *true* like ""You know what? I am just going to do this."". Everytime feel a negative thought coming on switch to ""You know what? Im going to do this."". 

Finally, **you may or may not have people you want to get the licence for, but at the end of the day nothing pushes you better than the desire to do this for YOU.** Honestly, that was the final push. And, you know what? I didnt decide I wanted to do this for me until THE DAY BEFORE THE TEST. But now I am more determined than ever. I feel like before I *thought* I wanted to get my licence for me, but, really, a piece of me was still secretly copping out and feeling ok with going the rest of my life without driving. How can I respect myself and think that? What a disservice I would be doing for myself. DO THIS because its good for you. DO this so you can remove limitations that not having a licence puts on you. Do this because you love yourself and you want to help yourself. 

Please let me know if you have any questions or thoughts. Id love to hear what you have to say and help whoever I can.",41,2016-08-19 09:16:27 EDT-0400
377,Im 21 years old and tomorrow I am going to face my driving phobia head on and take my drivers test,"3 months of getting my anxiety and depression treated and here I am. The doctor believes my GAD is strongly connected to my phobia. I have always been able to conquer my fears and anxieties, no matter how hard the struggle,..except for this one. This is the hardest thing I have ever faced in my entire life (and Ive been through a lot! Isnt that silly?) and is the sole source of ALL of my insecurities right now. For context I live in an area with basically no support for anything except for driving to get around so I have to do this and where I am it is really abnormal for someone my age to not be driving. My irrational fear is that I strongly believed I will get in a car accident and be severely wounded, but I know that that statistically doesnt happen to most people.

This is happening. Wish me luck. ",43,2016-08-18 04:26:41 EDT-0400
378,"Cold showers, if you can work them into your routine, will help with anxiety","Almost a year ago I started finishing every shower with 30 seconds to 1 minute of cold water. I did this as a part of a 30-day challenge with my brother and a mutual internet friend we met on Twitter. The 30-day challenge was spurred by [this episode of the Tim Ferriss Show with Wim Hof](http://fourhourworkweek.com/2015/09/07/the-iceman-wim-hof/).

We all completed the 30-day challenge with relative success, only skipping the cold shower a few times each throughout the challenge. What we found most interesting about the cold showers is that we all felt they enabled us to do everyday things that we typically would avoid or delay because of anxiety.

For example when we did the cold shower in the morning, we found it was easier to make a phone call that we were dreading or say Hi to an acquaintance in public. Our explanation for this was that cold showers are an anxiety inducing situation, but a safe one that you can do on your own with no one watching. When you do it, it puts a win under your belt early in the day which you can build on. It also just makes your body feel really good, so you get an immediate reward for doing it.

Since that challenge, I have kept the cold shower practice going and continue to experience these results. A cold shower isn't going to eliminate your anxiety, but I believe it is one small thing you can do every day that helps.

Oh and I'm not under the impression that we discovered anything new here. Polar bear clubs have been doing this for years. Our cold shower challenge was the same exact concept: challenge ourselves to experience cold water and do it in a social context so we can hold each other accountable. It's just a little easier to incorporate into your daily routine.

One thing that might limit your results is if you live in a relatively hot climate. Cold water just isn't as cold in Texas as it is in Michigan. It's all relative though, so it still might do the trick for you.",51,2016-08-16 17:51:16 EDT-0400
379,"I need to share this, because I feel that you will all understand.","On July 2nd I left my long time SO. The main factor, or rather the straw that broke the camel's back was the fact he didn't understand my anxiety and would worsen it with thinhs like his idea that holding me down during panic attacks was brilliant. I told him time and time again that it would only make things worse. But he refused to listen. He had been doing this for about 6 months, but it got to a point where he was causing them out of nowhere. 

I started medication 3 months ago and hadn't had an attack, aside from when being held down, in weeks. But that night he insisted I be held down. I immediately went into full panic, and tried pulling myself out of it. But he wouldn't let go, and he kept yelling and pulling harder. I was struggling as he progressed things, which only made me pull harder. He slammed my head into the ground and held me down until my arms were covered in bruises. [My eyes were black](http://imgur.com/ITI5zVO.jpg) and [my forehead had a huge goose-egg to go with my bruised arm](http://imgur.com/o4njqqP.jpg)

He spent years convincing me I was broken. That he was helping me by doing the things he did. He convinced me that my anxiety made me crazy. That he didn't have to answer to me about anything. If he disappeared for 4 hours longer than he said I was insane for checking up on him. I was so convinced I was in the wrong. That he really did have my interests in mind, and I was too far for help. 

Since leaving him I've never felt better. I realized just how much anxiety he caused, and that anxiety doesn't mean I'm crazy. It means I care more, I'm more cautious, that I think before I act. It means I will listen to you, and validate your feelings. 

Although I'm anxious about all of the court things, and feeling like he's going to come for me, or that my career will be ruined before it even begins, I'm able to recognize that they may not happen instead of being bombarded and told I'm insane. I have someone who listens to my thoughts and talks me through them instead of calling me stupid. It's so freeing to be anxious, because I don't feel like I have to hide it until I explode.

Edit: Thank you all for the kind words of support. It's been a rough time, but I feel so much happier in general. I reconnected with a guy friend of mine, M,  and we've begun a semi-relationship. He's much more understanding, and tries to help me cope with my anxiety instead of ignore it. He finds my neurotic habits endearing, and he's been around to listen to my stresses with this situation.

 I showed up at court today only to find my request for a deferred prosecution was granted. With this he will be unable to contact me or get in any legal trouble for a year. If he gets so much as a speeding ticket he will be back to court for this. Essentially I just wanted to let this die for now. I have my junior year of college coming up, not to mention many other stressors and truthfully I just want to move on with my life. I'm ready to progress my relationship with M, to make new friends, and to live my life for myself. 

I will likely be posting more, as I'd like to speak to others about my anxiety when I have a much better hold on it. Lately I've been able to see the build up and slow it down as opposed to being pushed into an attack. So I will likely chronicle it. :) 

Thanks again all!",27,2016-08-17 08:55:52 EDT-0400
380,"Guys, I made some friends!","I traveled to an international academic conference by myself. I'm pretty well-traveled, but being all alone in a professional social setting and leaving the comfort and safety of my home resulted in a panic attack on the 11-hour flight over. I worked through it, forced myself to sleep instead of throwing up, and survived. Yesterday I mustered all the courage I had and started a conversation with another girl at the conference who appeared to be all alone. That one girl turned into four other nervous solo travelers from all over, and now we've attended conference talks and dinners together as new friends. Sure, we'll only see each other literally once a year at the conference, but that makes a world of difference. 

Here's to surviving.

381,So I've drunk coffee today...,"I haven't drunk coffee for a year. Until today.

I really loved coffee, the flavor, the taste, but it was giving me instant panic attacks more often then not, so I decided to give it up. 
I've been working on myself really hard for the past ~6 months though and have been feeling particulary rebellious against my anxiety lately.
So today I decided to give my beloved coffee a go and see what happens. And basically... nothing happened. So a few hours later a followed the coffee with a strong black tea (I've cut out all sources of caffeine for that year). 
I started to feel maybe a little jittery, but decided to push myself further and went out for a walk and grocery shopping.

You see, I tend to get anxious everywhere besides my home just by being there. Shops and the subway are by far the worst. I'm hypochondriac and always afraid that I will faint/get nauseous/get a heart attack and I'm often paralized by the fear that other people will see it.

That's why going for a walk and some grocery shopping was a push for me.
And yeah, those thoughts ""You will get sick"", ""You'll faint"" popped out, but I thought back ""Kay, bring it"" and they basically disappeard.

I am feeling super fine now.

I'm not posting this to say that it's a great idea to down as much caffeine as you can, or any at all if you're struggling with anxiety.

I guess I'm just posting this here, because it's such a huge victory for me, conquering so many things at once.

I realised that at this point it's not coffee/city/shops that are giving me anxiety. It's anxiety that's giving me anxiety and it makes me feel much more free if it makes any sense to you.

So, anyways. It gets better. If you put the work in something, you'll get the results. That's my message. :)",64,2016-08-20 21:58:56 EDT-0400

383,Experienced my First Panic attack yesterday,"I've had anxiety for as long as I can remember but never experienced a truly crippling panic attack until yesterday. I have an interview for my dream job on Tuesday and while interviews always make me anxious, I've been feeling pretty confident this time around. 

Yesterday I spent some time preparing answers to potential interview questions and after an hour or two of productive work I decided to take a break. I was feeling excited and hopeful, confident that I had done more than enough to prepare. No more than 5 minutes later my chest tightened up, my heart started racing and I felt chills all over my body. Initially my mind was free of anxious thoughts, however, physically I felt as though I was no longer in control of my body. The feeling of no control eventually lead my mind into its own state of panic. 

I took a Klonopin and went to lie down to try some breathing exercises and relax. Usually when I'm feeling anxious, lying in bed is the only thing that makes me feel ""safe"" and relaxed. Unfortunately, it backfired this time. Lying motionless made my rapid heart rate much more noticeable and only added to my panic. 

At the height of my attack I recalled someone mentioning that coloring was the only thing to bring them peace. Lacking any supplies, I thought about walking to CVS to buy an ""adult"" coloring book and pack of colored pencils. I don't know how I managed to get myself out of the house, but once I stepped outside into the fresh air and sunshine, I began feeling a small sense of relief. I don't know if it came from the fresh air or the fact that I somehow regained control of my body, but the ounce of relief I felt was undeniable. 

As I made my way to CVS, my mindset slowly began changing from its state of overwhelming panic to a state of comfort. I didn't feel quite like I could see the light at the end of the tunnel, but I knew it was there and slowly approaching. Recognizing the difference helped ease my mind and slow my rapid heartbeat. 

I walked into CVS and made my way to the school supply section. The shelves were completely ransacked and mostly empty and my panic began creeping back as I realized Back to School is upon us. I scoured through the disarray of what was left and managed to find the LAST coloring book (lucky for me it came with a pack of colored pencils).

I went straight to checkout and headed home, protecting my coloring book as if it was a winning lottery ticket. When I got home I plugged in my noise-cancelling headphones and turned on some therapy music and got right to work on a heart-shaped bouquet of [flowers](https://i.imgur.com/6yxCTq2.jpg). 

Filling in the last flower made me feel as though I had left all of my anxious thoughts and feelings on the paper and replaced them with a colorful bouquet of happiness. 

At first I was skeptical that coloring of all things would help, but it did! It was incredibly helpful in changing my focus from my anxious thoughts to careful concentration of coloring. I would absolutely recommend it to anyone who needs to distract themselves from their anxious thoughts. Even writing this post a day later has been therapeutic and has made me realize that things do get better. I will definitely be keeping a coloring book and pencils handy in case of another emergency!

Update: Thank you everyone for all of your support! Just had the interview and I think it went well! The questions were surprisingly difficult but I think I answered them to the best of my knowledge and handled it with grace. At the end, before I could ask about ""next steps"" the interviewer said they would let the team know about our call and she would contact me later this week with next steps. I'm hoping this is a good sign, but I will keep you posted! Thanks again for your support, /r/anxiety! <3",29,2016-08-15 17:44:48 EDT-0400

388,I got my license,"I just wanted to share this somewhere, with people that might understand. I know that there was recently an amazing post on here about getting over the fear of driving/drivers test and it helped me a ton. 

But basically I'm 20 years old and I've always had a pretty big fear of driving. I know how to drive, but the test terrified me. I was afraid I'd have a panic attack and have to pull over and fail. Or that I'd just be so nervous that I'd make dumb mistakes that would screw me over (I did sort of do that in the beginning. I guess it's to be expected) but I PASSED! And I'm so damn proud of myself for overcoming this fear. Just know that if I can do it, you can too, even if you don't pass the first time, its possible to do anything even if you suffer from anxiety <3 ",16,2016-08-21 21:26:54 EDT-0400
389,I've reached my Nirvana.,"over the last month I've made increasingly drastic changes to my lifestyle. I've finally been able to face my anxiety, put a real face on it and finally been able to fight back against it.

I made the major change of forgiving myself for the mistakes I've made. Maybe I didn't do the best in school or university. Maybe I don't have a job right now because my anxiety kept me from working. But it just doesn't matter anymore to me. All that stress? all that extra baggage that was weighing me down? It's gone. I've finally achieved my nirvana. I have to take medication or the negativity will sit in my head. But the medication works. It actually works and now everything in my life is finally coming together.

I stood up to my sister and mom and was finally able to establish the boundaries in our relationships that I've needed to do my whole life.

I've rebuilt my relationship with my father.

I had a friend over for the first time in a long time. He's so positive now, he's reached his Nirvana as well and we just fed off it. We were laughing and smiling and having a wonderful time. I think I could end up getting the best friend I always wish I could have had when I was a kid.

The girl I love is taking baby steps back into my life. Now that the negativity is gone there's a light.

I went from.. underachieving. Always feeling like I wasn't good enough for anything. Hating the world, hating everything.

Now I have this light that just propels my forward. Positive people are coming back into my life in droves.

It's funny. I used to look at motivation speeches and think it was garbage. Those super passionate teachers I had that always said ""you'll love me when you're older, but you'll hate me now"" they were fucking right.

I've got what I need now. I grew my spine back. I feel like I finally realize that all the limits in my life were limits I just put on myself.

Everyone of you can do it too. You just need to have faith.

Remember. You're all worthwhile, no matter what anyone else tells you, no matter what your inner monologue tries to tell you. You're worth it.

I reached my Nirvana and I will fight tooth and nail to protect it.

I'm free.",17,2016-08-16 06:46:18 EDT-0400

398,My Neurofeedback experience- my anxiety and depression is basically gone,"I thought I would post about my experience with neurofeedback in treating depression and anxiety.
A little background, I've always had underlying depression and anxiety, but didn't start dealing with it until about 4 years ago when I kept having issues getting to work and having panic attacks. My social life suffered too, pushed away a lot of friends in that time, wanted to be alone yet I was lonely. I've done therapy (still do), tried several different medications, and had my ups and downs with my symptoms, but earlier this year, things got bad. I missed work several times, was very hopeless about the future. I even looked into going on disability just to not have to deal with anything anymore. At least that's the short story.

My therapist had just hired a person that specialized in neurofeedback treatment and she recommended I try it since I was struggling so much. I got more information on it and decided give it a try, I was desperate. The way I understand it, they match these sound waves to match the frequencies of your brain, then they adjust the frequencies to ""calm"" your mind. Overtime, your brain responds to this and changes. I would ruminate a lot, and get emotional about it, panic...well this like slows down the rumination. This treatment is used for other mental conditions like adhd and addiction (which I also have issues with). I can't remember the exact type I did, but I believe it is a slow wave form, perhaps infra-low frequency neurofeedback.

At the beginning of each session, not sure if this common though, I would do some slow breathing first and practice breathing deep. Then, she (my specialist) connected these electrodes to my head, and she put a movie on and played these sound waves that respond to your brain patterns. The movie is just to occupy your time, each session was 30 min. My specialists would ask me questions about how I was feeling and adjusted some things (the frequencies?) to tailor it to my needs. I had some weird effects early on, like I would feel itchy sometimes, or I could feel pressure in my head. But after a couple of weeks I was starting to feel better. Like, while I still wasn't happy with some things in my life,  my anxiety decreased drastically. I started it in February and by May my outlook on life was changing, I was more optimistic and didn't dread the future as much.

I have concluded my treatment for now (August), but I am a changed person. I haven't had a panic attack in a long time. I am more social, and I am actually looking forward to work. If I do get down or worried it usually has to do with my missing a dose of my medication (Viibryd). I haven't even taken a xanax in months.

I wanted to post this as a recommendation for those who are struggling. If I could be a commercial for this I would lol. I can't believe that it worked for me. Your brain can change! With anxiety and depression it's like the wiring in your head is just messed up, this like tunes it back up. I see a lot of posts that remind me of myself on here (or perhaps my ""old self"") and wanted to share this in case it could help anyone out there. Of course, naturally I do worry that it won't ""stick"", but according to the research, it should, but I can go in for a ""booster"" if I need to.
My insurance covered it, I had to do it twice a week at first, then dropped to once towards the end. Talk to your therapist or doctor and see if you can find a specialist in your area.

tl/dr- Neurofeedback saved me from the grips of depression and anxiety, it ""calms"" your brain down. I hope it can help you too. Talk to your doc or therapist about it.

If you have questions, I'll try my best to answer them.

Take care everyone!",21,2016-08-20 18:42:08 EDT-0400

400,Panic Attacks = Some pathetic shit that little sissies get in a flap about when things aren't going their way.,"Growing up I'd heard occasionally about these things called ""panic attacks"" that apparently some overly-sensitive people claim to get. Seriously? An attack... of panic? What a HILARIOUS concept!
 

It's probably like some precious little princess in third grade losing her shit because *Johnny flicked a booger in my hair* as her arms flail around and she screams like the little whiny girl she is. Or maybe it's like *oh my god, oh my god, oh my god, I'm running late for Yoga and I can't find my car keys and the dog just threw up* - cue more effeminate limp-wristed flailing and prancing. Or perhaps when you lose your phone and *oh shit I can't find it anywhere, where did I leave it? Was it stolen? Oh my god!* You know, just like... panicking. Everyone knows metaphorically what panic is. Some pathetic shit that little sissies get in a flap about when things aren't going their way or the food blender spills everywhere or your girlfriend sees a wasp. 


**NO.**


**NO NO NO.**


**NOT EVEN CLOSE.**


I had no idea what panic was until panic came to me a decade ago. 


Twenty-four years old of strapping athletic just-graduated pilot; cocky and overconfident to the extreme, bitch to nobody and obnoxious master of the known universe. I'm sitting in a pleasant country restaurant with my family and six friends, chowing down my rib-eye steak with a fine red wine and guffawing loudly as I regale the table with stories and bask in my own assured invincibility in the pantheon of men. 


Then a strange little sensation, imperceptible at first. 


Maybe I caught some steak in my throat? No, that's not it. Hmmm, my chest feels kinda strange like a... woah why am I so sweaty? I've stopped talking because my throat has clamped shut like a vice. The oxygen flow has turned to treacle and my throat insists its never known how to swallow. Why is everyone looking at me? Fuck this room is TINY. SO CROWDED. Something is wrong. Something is very wrong. My heart is pounding. My lungs can't function. Vision narrows and greys. The walls spin as the lump in your throat becomes a tumor that envelopes your entire existence. 


Then there is this overpowering feeling; a welling-up of all-encompassing fear. It's like an ocean surge. A rumbling from the depths of your soul that comes from the pit of your stomach at the edge of consciousness, rushing up your throat and into your brain like an unstoppable juggernaut on a collision course with your own demise. It's that crescendo of violins from the most terrifying horror movies just before the monster erupts from the dark, and it's coming for me. My whole temporal experience of the world has turned inwards and I'm pinned helpless to the moment. Inside my head a deafening megaphone overpowers every other thought - *Something dark, evil and truly awful is about to happen to you and you're powerless to stop it.*


Am I dying? Yes, that must be it. I'm dying. Fuck. I'M ACTUALLY ABOUT TO DIE. RIGHT NOW IN THIS ROOM. This is what a heart attack feels like. Your mind swims in a freezing, clammy, boiling torrent of fractured thoughts and confusing sensations as your body assumes the twitching convulsive outline of a fish caught on a hook. Vision loses focus, eyes dart in all directions. 


MY HEART! BOOMBOOMBOOMBOOMBOOMBOOMBOOM it goes, with the ruthless life-extinguishing violence of a machine-gun. Nothing seems real, seconds stretch to years. Familiar things distort into terrifying non-shapes as you try to grasp on to the slush that has suddenly replaced reality. Everything is wrong. So wrong. My universe is about to collapse. The only sensation: IMPENDING DOOM. I must escape! If only I can get out of this room in the next three nanoseconds maybe I can survive. 


I stumble to something resembling an upright position and announce garbled words in incoherent gibberish to the table before racing for the door in a shambling, hyperventilating mess. I'm dying. This is it. Any moment now. Will there be pain? I'll never see my family or loved ones again. I never even got to say goodbye. This is the end. Everything lurches and races as the world implodes around you. I sit down and hyperventilate, furiously trying to catch a breath that is never satisfied, obsessively clutching the maniac pulse in my wrist. That's no good. Stand up again. Even worse. Go outside. No, I'll just die out there. Back inside to curl up in a corner. Logic has been obliterated. I am no longer rational. All that I'm aware of is the guaranteed knowledge that I am about to pass irrevocably past the line of my sudden cardiac death. Nothing exists except my crumbling body in a thick swamp of immobilising terror. 


I'm face-down on the floor in the corner of the restaurant, panting for breath, hoping that every gasp of air I can squeeze into my lungs isn't my last and that my heart won't instantly rupture and explode in agony. This lasts an eternity. What is happening to me?
 

There is noise. A commotion. People. Hands on my shoulders. ""ARE YOU OKAY?"" ""HEY, LOOK AT ME!"" Am I okay? No I'm fucking dying you fucking idiot. Do something! Help me! *HELP ME!*



Fifteen minutes of absolute raw-faced terror pass, adrenaline and fear pouring from every sweaty inch of your soaked body. The interminable minutes seem like years. 


Slowly something comes together. The floor is the floor again. It's wooden. Brown. Shiny. I can touch it. That's okay. Hold on to it. The walls are here. I'm wearing blue jeans. My parents are hunched down next to me talking soothing words. 


IT'S GOING TO BE OKAY. JUST BREATHE. YOU'RE HAVING A PANIC ATTACK. DON'T WORRY. 


Like a murky runway appearing from the fog, lights of reality slowly begin to emerge. Breathing shallows. My heart starts to slow as the aura of doom subsides into a dull roar like a distant waterfall. 


Dinner is abruptly abandoned and I'm driven home slackjawed, a prisoner to my own reeling mind of neural traffic jams. What the fuck just happened to me? 


Before I know it, I'm on the couch at home with my shirt unbuttoned. An on-call doctor arrives and I try to articulate the symptoms of my almost-death. He attaches bulbous rubber suckers to my chest to perform an ECG, EEG and other tests. Everything is normal. Ask some questions, check the history. Nothing out of the ordinary, all systems nominal. 


""He'll be fine"" the doctor laughs, putting away the machines and tape prints.  ""Classic panic attack. Rest up and drink some tea.""


And that was the day I realized that anxiety and panic attacks aren't the pitiful little hand-flailing bad hair days that I'd condescendingly imagined. 



It's not the momentary nervousness of losing your phone or being late for an appointment. It's not just some trivial moment of stressful overreacting, and it certainly doesn't just happen to weak-willed schoolgirls and pussies. That's not true panic.  


True panic is the instantaneous, all-encompassing explosive jolt of terrifying **certainty** that without a doubt, **you are about to die** - right here and right now as your heart explodes - and submerge suffocatingly into a crushing blackness you never knew existed. 


Anxiety burst into my life without warning during a peaceful family dinner while I was at the prime of my life, so confident in my mastery over the world that I never imagined a crippling betrayal would come from inside my own body.  It can come to anyone at any time.

I have suffered with anxiety since I was 13-14, and I have always had trouble dealing with new people. I either shut down completely, or scare them away because I open up to quickly. And past experiences have made me stop myself and be afraid to have a relationship. 

I basically have no filter when I talk (still working on that). It's one of my mayor flaws because I say shit I shoudn'y be saying, and end up in trouble or just in awkward situations. That being said, if I find something off about a situation, or something that I like about someone, I will voice it. This also is a problem, because I don't order my ideas before I voice them, and almost noone understands me. BUT, this dude tries to be patient with me, and he also has walked me through a panick attack.

I also already asked him out last year, but I panicked when he said yes and immediately told him that a friend was also comming to see the movie with us.

Well, yesterday I asked him again, he said yes. I almost had a panick attack on my own when he left, and almost text him again telling him that a friend was coming with us.

But I didn't.

I calmed myself down. 

And I have a date with this dude.

I can't believe I did this.

EDIT: Wow, first I wanna thank everyone who has given me good wishes. I never thought this thread would get this big. I will update as soon as something about the date changes, when the date happens and after 'happenings'. :)",56,2016-06-06 21:38:28 EDT-0400

408,Brain Never Stops,"For the second time this year, I finished a major project for work, but instead of feeling relieved, I feel totally wound up.

This is the side of anxiety that's so hard to explain to people who've never felt it:

There is nothing wrong. Nothing that needs to be done immediately. No deadlines. No projects at home. 

Yet here I sit, my heart pounding and my mind haunted by a specter of dread.

I try to take my mind off it by playing a computer game. But then I feel like I am putting of work. So I sit down to do work, but then I realize I am between projects. So I go outside to sit and relax. And my mind says, ""What are you just sitting around for?? There's so much to be done!""

My brain never turns off. It just keeps pecking at my sense of calm. Don't stop working...you'll fall behind. Don't take a break...there's more to do. Don't eat out of boredom...you'll get fat. Don't start that building project...you won't have time to finish it.

People worry about something and say, ""Oh, I have such anxiety!""

Maybe you are anxious. But you do not have anxiety.

Anxiety is this unwelcome guest that stays in your bed with you, and follows you to work, and to the movies, and to the gym. And you beg it to go away. And when you think it has, you feel like something is missing...a part of you. And your chest tightens again, and the dread creeps back, and anxiety says, ""JK! I never left. I just wanted you to know how much you need me.""

I don't need it. But I have it. And goddamn but how I want to get rid of it...",19,2016-06-04 23:43:25 EDT-0400
409,Wanting to die - while also being terrified of dying.,"I've got both depression and anxiety.

410,Fighting 'what if' thoughts and worst case scenarios,"I only realise this now but I suffer from catastrophizing, which is believing the worst will happen. I've always had this affliction, for example if Mum was 10 mins later than she said she would be, I would be certain that she died or something horrible happened. 

I hadn't suffered from this in a while, until 2 weeks ago, where I'm now constantly fighting these thoughts. I know these thoughts are irrational, several other people have told me so. When I analyse the thoughts I always in the end find ways to console myself that I'm being ridiculous. However the thoughts don't stop and constantly having to analyse them and fight them is wearing me down. 

I've googled this issue and whilst a lot of what I read is helpful, I'm having a hard time letting these thoughts go. I feel like if I ignore them I'm not caring enough that this horrible thing will happen and then I am drawn back into fighting them. 

If anyone could help me resist the urge to fight these 'what if' and worse case scenario thoughts, I'd really appreciate it! ",21,2016-06-03 16:21:05 EDT-0400

What items would help calm her nerves? 

I want to also put positive notes in there for her to find and read,  what does a person with anxiety need to hear?",23,2016-06-05 05:10:19 EDT-0400
412,"I keep feeling things crawl on my skin ,hear noises or voices and sometimes see things. What does this mean?","Sometimes I'll have sleepless night because I feel things crawling on my skin or pinch me, but I swear I don't see any bugs or anything. I've checked my sheets and blankets, several times. Even right now I keep fidgeting becuase I have to rub my face or scratch my arm or something.

I'lll hear things, too. Like bumps through my headphones. I take them out real quick to listen, but then it's gone. It can't be coming from my headphones. A few months ago, I had a nigheborg always complain of noise. I know for a fact that it was coming from my sister's room, becuase she stomps, jumps around and slams he door. The police was called on us, a few times. I tried telling my sister to quiet down, but I'm younger than her, so I feel that she believes she doesn't have to listen to me. This has made me very scared and paranoid because I'm terrified of getting evicted. I don't have my own car, nor do I have the money to even deal with that. 

Lastly, I keep seeing things at the corners of my eyes. Like black flashes of whatever. It can't be bugs because then I won't see the flashes, anymore. It's too big to be a fly, too.I hardly ever open my window, do it definitely can't be that. But sometimes tiny flies get into my room, but they always gather near the light of my computer scree, and they don't move as fast as these flashes.

I don't understand what's happening and I'm scared :(

This has been going on for a while. Maybe I'm always scratching or feeling things becuase I've been taking terrible care of myself. I suffer from depression. I'll go days without showering, but I'm trying to be better about that. I brush my teeth everyday and night, too. Well, occasionally I'll forget to brush at night. But last summer I was so bad that I went weeks at a time without showering or brushing. ",38,2016-06-04 17:52:17 EDT-0400
413,"Fighting anxiety is hard, like really hard","I do so much to try and fight it. I exercise most days, I fixed and try to stay on top of my diet, I've removed caffeine and limit alcohol, I'm on my third SSRI, fingers crossed I don't get unbearable side effects on this one. I constantly try to carry out what I learned through CBT and use on-line CBT resources to keep me going until I can get more therapy sessions. I try to put myself in a controlled way in situations I know will make me anxious to try and overcome them. I talk to people who relax and calm me and know about my situation, I know sometimes I just need to stop and go and have a time out, I have a relax corner with emergency supplies of chamomile and peppermint tea and my favourite books and music.

Anxiety itself already costs a lot of energy. The constant fear takes its toll. But still I pick myself up and try to fight it day after day come hell or high water, I wont let it win, I can't let it win. I might have inherited anxiety and panic from my Mother but fortunately I got my Dad's unrelenting positivity to try and fight this. I worry what will happen if this breaks me and I lose this positivity, I'm 90% sure that would destroy my life. 

Some days are worse than others. The energy I have to spend every day just to turn up and be like 'Yes I have attempted this day' makes me envy 'normal' people. Trying to complete a 4-year degree on top of this is a near impossible task only someone who was mentally ill would even dare attempt. 

But here I am. Three years down, one more to go.

414,Anxiety convinces me everyone hates me,"I have had fairly mild general anxiety for the past 4 years. It's always been manageable without the use of medicine. But recently, with a lot of stress and depression, my anxiety is spilling over into my social life. I'm convinced that, either as a result of my anxiety or because of the anxiety itself, every one of my friends is mad at me or can't stand me or even hates me. 

I typically don't care. I keep my circle small and typically I know the people I chose to have in my life love and care about me. But even that is crushing me. I have no reason to believe that my friends are talking about me behind my back, but I am convinced they are. 

I honestly don't know how to handle it. ",13,2016-06-02 22:37:35 EDT-0400

418,Withdrawal is very real and it's something that you'll need to work through (My experience getting off of Prescription Drugs).,"I have been dealing with bad anxiety for months now. I have been on and off Xanax and Celexa throughout this period. Being on medication is not something that I wanted, especially the Xanax due to its highly addictive nature. I wanted to deal with my anxiety through therapy and other methods that did not involve medications.

With the help of my doctor, I established a plan for weaning myself off these drugs. The plan was to spend an entire month gradually stepping down the dosages. I spent the first week at .5mg of Xanax and 10mg of Celexa per day. The second week was .375mg of Xanax and 10mg of Celexa per day. The third week was .25mg of Xanax and 5mg of Celexa per day. The final week was .125mg of Xanax and 5mg of Celexa per day.

The biggest thing that I learned during this month is that **withdrawal is going to occur**. Unfortunately, it is inevitable and there were certain side effects that were out of my control. The worst of it, for me, was the insomnia. As I approached the smaller dosages, I could not sleep at all. No matter how calm and restful I felt, sleep would not come. Over the course of about two weeks, I got very little sleep: maybe an hour or two per night. It was awful. I was incredibly sleep-deprived and my eyes were so bloodshot.
Eventually, though, I had one night of about four hours of sleep, followed by one of five hours, followed by one of six hours, and so on, until my sleeping pattern started to return to normal.

I just wanted to share my experience for those of you who are looking to stop taking medications like these. **Expect withdrawal and do anything in your power to help yourself work through it.** There is a light at the end of the tunnel and the withdrawal will end at some point. It varies for each person, but you just have to fight through it and you will eventually feel better!

419,I feel like my friends aren't actually my friends.,"Ninja Edit: For reference, I am an 18-year-old male who is graduating high school next week.

Every person I like to talk to seems to want to talk to me less and less. Whenever I try to have a one-on-one conversation, in person or over text, with a person, it seems to me that they are just trying to get away from me as fast as possible. Over text, they take longer and longer to reply, with replies getting shorter and shorter. Eventually, they just stop replying altogether or never reply in the first place, despite our seemingly good relationship. On the other hand, I see these same people texting each other non-stop when I am around them in real life, so the problem is not that they don't check their phones often.

I keep telling myself that everyone I try to text is just busy or they don't check their phones often- though I think I know the truth. People don't like texting me or talking to me one-on-one no matter how we're doing it and I have no idea why this is happening. It feels like I am not close to any of my friends, despite having plenty of people who would call me a ""friend."" I don't have any single person I can just talk to and expect them to appreciate me as much as if not more than their other friends. I have no ""best friend"" and can't remember a time I ever have had a best friend in my entire life. The closest I have had to a best friend are two girls: the first girl (17/f) helped me with my problems and I helped her with her problems, we shared a deep connection over text but in real life she never treated me as much more than an acquaintance; the second girl (16/f) was my girlfriend for 10 months but we broke up a month ago and by the end it seemed like she was fighting to get away (though there were legitimate reasons for her wanting that).

Is this feeling normal? Am I just unreasonably panicking? For the past month, I have felt totally and utterly alone and I have had no one to turn to, despite hanging out with my friends multiple times. Oh, and that reminds me, whenever I hang out with my friends I don't usually feel very included unless I initiate situations in which I have to be included- such as games or activities.

This entire afternoon, I have felt as though I want to just talk to someone and enjoy their company and have them enjoy mine just as much- however, I cannot think of a single person I know who would actually enjoy doing this, even though I can think of plenty of people with whom I would enjoy doing this. This sort of scenario has panned out multiple times over the past month because before then I would always text my ex-girlfriend when having any of these sorts of feelings; however, I can't text her or the other girl any more due to our rough break up.",5,2016-06-02 05:13:19 EDT-0400

For as long as I can remember, the morning has been a difficult time for me. Most days I wake up in a panic with the worst feeling of doom and dread. Sometimes it's about nothing and sometimes it's specific to the day ahead. I usually end up feeling better after a run with my dog and once I get going with my day but I feel like my ability to be happy is greatly impaired by this horrible feeling when I wake up.

424,Xanax; sweet xanax,"I started Zoloft a week ago for anxiety that has been building for a while and is beginning to impact noticeably on my performance at work. I will gradually taper up to 100mg and I start counselling next week. Overall my experience so far is positive; my managers, even though they appear impatient, have been very supportive and as understanding as they can be. They know I am good at what I do, but also they understand that Life is clearly piling it on and I'm not coping very well. 

When my doctor asked if my anxiety, when in full swing, is in need of medicating like with Xanax. I immediately said no, it's not at that level at all, but also mentioned I was taking a 14hr flight in two weeks and that I'm a bit nervous about it, so she said here's some xanax for that, and a bit extra if you get caught up in any panicky moments while you're away.

So I took 500mcg last night as a sort of test run (I don't want the first time I try a fast acting benzo to be when I'm stuck in a tin can thousands of feet in the air -- what if I have an adverse reaction??) and I do get the irony about being anxious over taking a xanax ha. But sweet Jesus did I sleep well!!!!! That was the BEST night's sleep I've had in weeks! WEEKS! and I went to work this morning still feeling the affects, and floated on through the doors with such a spring in my step, I had forgotten what it was like to actually enjoy getting up for work in the morning! What a refreshing, if a little artificial, feeling. 

It's a drug. I know. It's fake happiness and fake relaxation and fake sleep. But the enjoyment and the courage to face the day was real. I can't wait to feel this way without medication. ",41,2016-06-05 01:17:19 EDT-0400

426,HUGE Victory today: took my car to a show and talked to tons of people,"Lately my anxiety has been terrible but I've been managing with therapy, meds, and a benzo (only .5mg) when it gets real bad. It's really hindered my drive to go out and I can feel underlying agoraphobic that I'm desperately fighting to not let win. 

Anyway there was this huge Miata meet today that I had been planning on going to for months. The thought of not going crossed my mind many times this morning but I remembered something my friend and psychologist said which is just do what you would have done before the anxiety started, so I went. 

40 minute drive later I was one of the first cars there, these random guys that were behind me most of the way there parked next to me and started talking to me immediately and I think that broke the ice. There were over 150 cars and I walked around the entire time, never once did I feel panic, need to go to a quiet space for a second, and my worst fear, having to leave early. I was totally fine and calm once I got there and started walking around. What was even better is that I talked to so many random people! I was there by myself and figured I wouldn't talk to many people but I found myself going over to people and asking about their cars or them asking about mine. I was pretty much talking to a random person at all times for over 4 hours. I met a lot of great people and stayed until the very end with only minor anxiety. 

Sure the benzo did help but lately even with that pill I've been struggling a lot, especially in social situations where I used to thrive. Still, I don't even remember myself being this social before my anxiety got worse, so that's awesome. Just wanted to share, that anxiety can be beat, wish you all the best.

428,Reddit. I learned about something today which might explain why trying to be positive actually makes my anxiety WORSE,"A few days ago I picked up a book at a discount store about positive psychology (the study of how people with optimal mental health live their lives), didn't think much about it, but started reading. I came across something called ['defensive pessimism'](http://academics.wellesley.edu/Psychology/Norem/Quiz/quiz.html). A defensive pessimist is someone (who typically has anxiety) who can easily imagine the different ways things can go wrong. For them, lowering anxiety involves ruminating about all the worst case scenarios and preparing/bracing for them. Crucially, *not* thinking about the worst-case scenario and setting positive or high expectations about the situation they're anxious about actually *raises* their anxiety levels. 

Then we have the strategic optimist (people who typically don't have anxiety problems). For them, the opposite's true. If they dwell too much on worst-case scenarios, their anxiety increases.

I'm, quite clearly, a defensive pessimist. I hate people telling me that something's unlikely to happen, because in my mind, there's *always* a chance that something bad's going to happen, no matter how small. And I wasn't a fan of CBT for this reason, though there are some techniques that might be useful, the majority of it was like, ""oh that's unlikely"", ""you're catastrophizing"", ""stop expecting the worst!"". And it just didn't fucking work. Now I know why.",31,2016-07-16 20:22:48 EDT-0400

440,Didn't need a benzo today!,"My anxiety, that I never got help for 2 years ago, came back recently in full swing along with panic attacks so I finally got help. My doctor gave me a perscription of 10mg of Celexa to be taken every day and .5 mg of Larazapan to be taken as needed. I've also been seeing a psychologist once a week. 

However since the last week of June (when this flared up) it's been hell. I've had to take a benzo pretty much every 24 hours to even pull myself out of bed or eat anything. Every day I've tried to push farther without the benzo but I've had to give in and take it, until today!

I successfully have gone over 24 hours without taking a benzo and feel pretty good! Granted today was a really chill day: I accidentally slept like 10 hours, it was my day off, and all I did was drive around a bit, but it was also in the high 90s and I've been planning some stuff for the weekends, both of which have been setting off my panic lately. 

I'm not sure if it's the Celexa working (doc said 6-8 weeks for it to work, it's only been 3) or the CBT skills kicking in, but I'm really glad I got through today without one. In not against medication at all but I've heard benzos aren't something you want to be on long term.

441,"Magnesium has helped stop my panic attacks and reduce my general anxiety to 10% of what it was, but the other symptoms are still there.","First of all, thanks reddit! You were right, magnesium has been a massive help. I've had only one panic attack since I started taking it and I've been sleeping better, though if I take too much I feel even more tired. But anyway, the point of this post is that the other symptoms are still there and I don't know what to do about them.

I still feel very forgetful and unable to focus. If someone tells me something at work, I'll have to ask them to repeat it five minutes later. I still have to ask the same question every day because nothing seems to stick. I can almost feel sentences going in one ear and straight out the other. I used to be a top student and have a razor sharp memory so it's more than a little frustrating. I'm still constantly anticipating the worst too, thinking that every mistake I make is going to get me fired, but it's not accompanied by the usual heart palpitations/shaking/nausea.

I feel like if I can just conquer this ""mind blank"" problem, it'll be a huge step forward and would make so many of the other issues I've been dealing with easier to manage too. Has anyone else got past this point?",29,2016-07-19 01:25:19 EDT-0400

444,I'm Not Okay.,"My grandfather is dying.


I posted elsewhere about it a few days ago but yesterday we were told this is the end. He cannot survive this.


He raised me when my father left and my mother fell into a deep dark hole of depression.


He gave me a childhood, he gave me happiness, he gave me my attitude.



Each day he would tell me that being his grandaughter meant i was tough, i was strong, i would take no shit from anyone and one day rule the world.



He is my rock.



Or he was my rock.


He's been on the decline for years.


**This is the end**.



When im at the hospital i cling to his hand and i can't leave his side but im constantly screaming inside with fear that he will die infront of me.



When im at home or just away from the hospital im in constant fear he will die and wonder where i was. I want him to know im there, i want him to know i care.


He is surrounded by family but i felt like he needed me there.


I realise that i need him to need me there, i dont want to lose him, i need him in my life forever.



He has been through so much i figured he was indestructible.

He was the first person to survive his condition in my country... 



To me that is a person that will live forever.
I know its not possible but i need him to live forever.




Im having constant panic attacks that im either going to miss his death or im going to witness it


I can't visit this entire weekend and anytime my phone makes a noise i delve into a full blown panic attack.





I need this to stop, i can't do this anymore, i can't take the pain ",6,2016-07-16 17:48:02 EDT-0400

446,It seems like OCD and GAD have opposing treatment strategies," Exposure and Response Prevention therapy for OCD suggests that you should refuse to engage with your obsessive anxious thoughts as you'll never out-logic them, essentially. Trying to rationally disprove your thoughts or the lack of logic behind your compulsions will just lead to more doubt and questioning.

Meanwhile, a common CBT exercise for Generalized Anxiety Disorder suggests that you make a list of ""Automatic thoughts"" and counter each thought with a ""Rational response"". e.g., ""Automatic thought - my boss will fire me. Rational response - it was a small mistake, Phil in accounting did the same thing and no one cared, I'll probably be fine.""

As someone with comorbid OCD and GAD, sometimes I have worries that are overtly one or the other, but sometimes there's an overlap. So I'm not too sure what to do in those situations. 

Not really sure what my point is here, just wondering if anyone else has noticed this. ",6,2016-07-18 19:42:36 EDT-0400

453,I had a pretty major breakthrough.,"Okay, so I've had anxiety for a long time. I've learned to tame most of my demons, except for a big one- emergencies. Any time I'm in an emergency (weather, car, personal, medical), I fly off the handle and turn into a snotty, crying, shaking ball of emotion. 

I recently acquired a Jeep that was in pretty rough condition. Thanks to the help of some close friends, I've been able to get it up and running. Today it ran almost entirely without a problem. I was driving up to town from my new apartment (about 20 minutes drive). I get most of the way there, and notice a loss of power. I jam on the gas, no acceleration. I try to flip my hazards on (I'm on a bridge and can't pull over yet), but they don't go. Cars are whizzing past. I get off the bridge, coast a couple hundred yards, pull off, and kill the engine.

I managed to keep myself from panicking during the entire ordeal. I called my dad for help on what to do, then call my friends for their mechanical advice. Not one time did I give in to my fear and emotion. I am really, really, really incredibly proud of myself for choosing annoyance over anxiety as an emotion for the situation. 

May luck be with you all today!

454,What it’s like to live with anxiety and 5 ways to help anxious people,,8,2016-03-17 17:16:43 EDT-0400
455,"Is anybody else horrified they'll never meet ""the one"" and live alone for the rest of their lives?","This has always been a big one for me, and nowadays it's coming back in full force. 

I'm pretty much addicted to love (romantic comedies, sitcom romances [e.g. Chandler and Monica, Jim and Pam, Corey and Topanga], ... young adult novels where the hero and supporting character realize their feelings for each other over the span of three books and live happily ever after at the end).

It's just something I desperately want in my life and have wanted for years. But after a couple flings, a failed short-term relationship, a failed longish-term relationship, and striking out with three girls in the past few months, I'm starting to worry I'll never have it.

It doesn't exactly help that I'm slowly getting over social anxiety that held me back in my teens, and so am not meeting new women on a daily basis.

Granted I'm 20 and still in college, with about 4 years to go until I finally get my Counseling MA. But all I want is to meet my wife and start a family together. I think about it every day, and when I notice I don't seem to be making progress towards that, I start to worry I never will.

Can anybody else relate? Does anybody have success stories that might make me feel better?

Edit: By ""the one"" I don't mean the mystical concept of a girl I've been destined to meet and is my eventual soulmate. I don't believe in that. I just mean the girl I'm going to marry.",59,2016-03-16 08:47:00 EDT-0400
456,Is it possible to have physical anxiety symptoms without feeling anxious?,"I have been experiencing this gag reflex sensitivity for a couple years now.  I've read a ton of stuff that tells me it's a very common anxiety issue.  But I honestly felt something was physically wrong because I had no anxiety feelings.  
At times I've had anxious thoughts and things I could see how I was anxious about.  But only if I sat and thought about what could possibly be making me anxious.  Normally I didn't feel anxious.  But docs said there's nothing wrong with my throat.  It has to be anxiety.  Is this possible in your opinion?",64,2016-03-21 18:44:18 EDT-0400
457,"Anybody experience this; ""unsatisfying"" breaths?","This is kind of hard to describe, but I'll give it a shot. 

It started when I was young and it will disappear for years. I'll go to take a breath but it won't ""satisfy"", so I'll need to take an even deeper breath to reach that satisfying sensation. But even with a deep breath the sensation isn't guaranteed. And even when I do get the sensation it will only provide relief for a few minutes.

There have been times when I couldn't catch the feeling no matter how many breaths I take and it's extremely distressing, leading to a panicky feeling.

Sometimes I'll need to vary my approach. I'll try to surprise the feeling with a quick breath, or breath slowly in then sharply inhale when I'm on the cusp, or try to simulate a yawn.

I recently went through a sort of breakup so I know it's stress/anxiety related. I know what I wrote sounds absolutely crazy and maybe I am, but perhaps anyone can commiserate??",32,2016-03-15 01:45:57 EDT-0400
458,Good jobs for people with high anxiety?,"So I was recently let go of one of the jobs I was at for about three years. I took another job a few weeks later that was a call center job, and I only lasted about a month and a half because the job gave me such extreme anxiety and depression, I just didn't wanna risk my health for a paycheck. So I am back on the job hunting front.

The job I was let go from was probably the best job for my anxiety I've ever had - never really had to interact with customers, was primary data entry and was able to zone out and do my work while listening to music. The worst thing about it was I still had to deal with my coworkers, which for the most part was fine, but there was a lot of company drama which I hated being a part of.

Anyone have any idea of good jobs for anxiety? I know obviously everyone is a little different, but your experiences would inspire me what to look for. I need to work full-time at a job $10 or over, or part time at a higher wage job. ($15ish maybe?) to give you an idea of the sort of salary I am needing. Again I know that varies by location, but certain job types are usually at least similar in wages.

Long story short, police are watching me as I'm walking around so I try and get as far from them as possible so go to the most remote part of the graveyard.

They follow me and ask me what I'm doing. This is my worst nightmare as all I can say is, im just having a walk. Turns out the graveyards a popular place for drug users and so now in their eyes I am one.

They will NOT work and you will likely hurt yourself by trying to stop medicating. These posts are very misleading and unsafe for those currently medicating or for those who need medication.

466,Do you ever have days where you're perfectly fine?,"Anxiety affects me almost daily. It's usually mild, and I can almost always work my way out of the anxiety so I can force myself do whatever it is I don't want to. 

Once a month or so, it'll get bad and I can't do things like go to the grocery store, make a phone call. 

Hell, sometimes it gets so bad I can barely go to work. And, I work from home, so that's pretty bad when I can't even get myself to log on to our team chat room. 

But, some days I'm fine. No anxiety at all. I can go to the grocery store and even make small talk with the cashier. Sometimes I can go out in public all day and talk to tons of people without any anxiety. 

This only happens once ever 2-3 months. 

I can't explain how or why it happens. 

I know exactly how I go into panic. Something will pop into my brain, worry me, fester, and it'll snowball until I'm a nervous wreak. I know exactly how my train of thought takes me there, but I can't stop it. 

And other times, when it's one of those lucky days, I could have the exact same thought that would usually start an attack, and I shrug it off like its nothing — ""pfft. That's stupid. Don't worry about it."" And, I just don't.

470,How I managed to alleviate most of my anxiety symptoms,"Hello reddit, I just wanted to share with you some pointers that I wish I knew sooner when dealing with my anxiety.

For about 3 years I've been experiencing some pretty terrible anxiety. It seemingly came out of nowhere even though I should, in theory, have little to worry about. I've had moments where I've sat in the bathroom at work with my head in my hands begging for the symptoms to stop. One day I had to tell my boss I had to go home and blamed it on feeling ill. In reality, I was on the verge of a panic attack and I went straight into the hospital to find help.

I've been fighting this anxiety in full force for around a year and 
I now believe I'm starting to feel better. My states of panic are now further apart from one another I've also found myself having generally good thoughts.

Now I'm going to tell you a few rules of thumb to help you right now that I apply every day.

**The worst thing you can do when you're anxious is wrestle your thoughts** 

As disturbing, dark and messed up as they may be. It's like turning the temperature up on a boiling stove. Sometimes you have to step aside and focus on not thinking and being within the present moment. Get into a comfortable and quiet position, focus on your breathing in and out and just turn the temperature down within your mind. Close your eyes if you want to but just breath and be until your mind has slowed down, anxiety attacks usually last around 15 minutes (general anxiety can last for weeks or months) but you'll be fine afterwards.

I read a book called Mindfulness an Eight-Week Plan for Finding Peace in a frantic world by Mark Willaims and Denny Penman (This book is an absolute must buy!!). One thing that what was mentioned in the book was that the brain is a very good calculating machine that tries to find patterns and ways to solve things. Kind of like how our brains see faces on objects as we anthropomorphize. The problem with this is when it's applied to anxiety. Your brain is using a lot of mental energy to solve an issue that cannot be solved by thinking/calculating. You have to learn to shut your mind off and **be easy on yourself**

**Anxiety is physical as well as mental**

As you apply the point above what you have to realise is that anxiety is as much mental as it is physical. Learn to scan each individual body part and relax. I would often tense up with my anxiety. I found myself clenching my fists, gritting my teeth, tensing my chest where my heart was and other body parts. No wonder science mentions that people die younger because of mental problems because you're stressing your body out. Learn to relax each individual body part out wherever you are. make sure you're very thorough and focus from your little toe to your head and learn how to relax each part. I remember having strange heart palpitations and pains in my chest from time to time. This freaked me out but after I learnt to relax my individual body parts it stopped.

**If you can't find a comfortable position and a quiet place**

I tend to brute force my thoughts but not in the way you would think. When I lose any sense of control and become isolated I tell my brain to give me more anxiety. I don't fight my thoughts but I will my brain to give me more. I don't purposely freak myself out and I try to keep my composure not getting angry with myself but I keep telling my brain to give me more. As I know that every single time I go through a horrible anxiety attack I've come out alive. I didn't go insane, my friends didn't hate me, my family wasn't about to die and I did well in work and these thought always ended up being false. I was *ALWAYS* fine it was just my brain going haywire. By willing your brain to give you more anxiety and showing yourself that you're not scared of the impending doom and despair. The anxiety actually starts to disappear. But only use this when you cannot find a quiet and comfortable spot.

**Stop being lazy and get more active**

I'm being serious with this one get on a treadmill and run until you feel like death. The boost of mental energy is amazing its like taking a drug, one that only had upsides. Better yet goto a martial arts class as many times as you can in the week to make you feel confident and work yourself to the bone. I recently joined an MMA gym and go around 3-4 times a week. Practicing Muay Thai, MMA, Boxing, Ju Jitsu.. the lot. This kind of exercise drains your mental and physical energy so much that after each session I didn't have the energy to worry anymore. I would feel awesome beyond belief. The endorphins that get released into your brain help you immensely. After a workout too you will feel like you can sleep ALOT better because you're bodies exhausted. Your brain also receives a cognitive boost and I no longer get that sense of feeling stupid, alot of the time anyway. I also feel a hell of a lot more confident.

 **Get Medicated If You Have To**

Medication may seem like a big thing but in the grand scheme of things its not. If it puts you on the road to recovery and helps you out that little bit extra then speak to your doctor. Some people even experience NO SIDE EFFECTS whilst if you're like me well I did experience some.

I would wake up each morning throwing up, feeling dizzy, couldn't sleep having waking nightmares and generally felt fucking awful as a side effect from the medication. But I persisted knowing that if I stopped the medication now I would become alot worse. Now after a few months on medication, I feel great.

**Mental States Are Like the Weather**

The brain cannot maintain a steady state of mind. Meaning that it's not possible to be happy all the time. Your emotions are much like the weather you cannot control them. If it rains put up your umbrella, if you're sad, understand this is a passing emotion out of your control. Often trying to be happy all the time is counter-productive. You often start blaming yourself for not being happy all the time and get sad as a result. The funny thing is though, is that it's impossible to have this state of mind forever. As soon as you stop worrying about what mood you're in your overall state of worry will also decrease.

**You May Be In This for The Long Term**

If you suffer with a mental illness it can be much like diabetes where it's something that you have to deal with for the rest of your life or, at least, a long period of time. This isn't necessarily a bad thing it's just a fact of life and it also doesn't mean you can eliminate most of the symptoms and live a happy life. Just don't expect results overnight, sometimes you have to stick to a strict regime of self-healing for a long period of time until you start seeing good results. Just remember that with the correct help and commitment you can drastically improve your life.

475,Be aware of your distorted thinking,"In general, there are 6 types of distorted thoughts that lead to anxiety.

Personally, being aware of these types of distorted thoughts helps me to identify which of my thoughts are anxiety and which of my thoughts are valid. Being able to identify anxious thinking is the first step in dealing with it. 

1) **Probability Overestimations**- Exaggerated beliefs about the chances of a negative event or outcome happening. 

Examples: Thinking that there is a high chance of dying in a plane crash. Assuming that your best friend doesn't like you anymore because they didn't respond to your text right away. Most ""What if..."" type thoughts. 

2) **All or Nothing Type Thinking**- Black/White thought patterns, judging everything as good or bad without recognizing that life is, in fact,  mostly ""grey area"". Judging something as negative when it is actually neutral. This type of thinking plays a big part for people that struggle with perfectionism. 

Examples: Interpreting someones neutral facial expressions as negative because they aren't obviously happy- ""If it's not positive than it must be negative"". -On diet> eat cupcake> think diet in now ruined> proceed to eat entire XL pizza & wings b/c your diet is ""ruined"" anyway due to the cupcake. 

3) **Catastrophic Thinking**- Exaggerating the importance of an event or outcome. (Not to be confused with point #1: probability overestimation, although the two are intimately related.) Underestimating your ability to cope in the unlikely event that the ""worst possible case"" does come true.  

Example: ""If this first date doesn't go well I will probably die alone with 80 cats."" When in reality, if the date doesn't go well it holds no power over the rest of your life. In reality, 5 minuets after the date is over, it doesn't matter anymore.

""It will ruin my life if my new coworkers don't like me"" When in reality, even if they hate you, you can always get a new job, or even be professionally successful without having a personal relationship with your colleagues. 

4) **Personalization**- Blaming yourself and only yourself for negative situations. 

Example ""That was an awkward conversation because I am awkward"". When in reality the other person has 50% responisibilty for the conversation.

5) **Mind Reading**- Making assumption about what others think. 

Example: ""That server was a dick to me because she doesn't like me"" when in reality she was just in a bad mood because her husband cheated on her. 

6) **Selective Attention and Memory**- This is the tendency to focus on information that is consistent with your beliefs. If you believe that the world is dangerous or that people don't like you or that you are unworthy etc etc, your brain will pay attention to ""evidence"" that is consistent with your beliefs. Kind of like how you always notice cars on the road that are the same as yours. 

Example: You notice the 3 people who you perceived to look negative during your presentation and ignore the 15 that looked positive or neutral. Or worse, you perceived the neutral to be negative (see point #2).

What types of distorted thinking do you engage in the most? What are some specific examples?

476,I didn't have a panic attack today,"I don't have them very often, only when something triggers it. A small thing will happen, and my paranoia will set in ultimately convincing me that I am going to die. 

I had a pain in my chest when I woke up. Anxiety immediately says, ""You're having a heart attack; you'll probably die."" But knowing that it's probably just gas, I kept repeating, ""We're not gonna do this today. You're probably fine, and not gonna die.""

Surprisingly, this worked! I also kind of just accepted my death, just in case. But here I am, alive and well. I thought I'd share this with you guys in case someone else can use it. ",22,2016-06-26 18:42:38 EDT-0400
477,"""No amount of anxiety makes any difference to anything that is going to happen"" - Alan Watts","I saw this quote the other day on Twitter and it instantly become one of my favorites of all time. Anxiety can be really tough to endure and you may have a hard time thinking of something else, but whenever you're having anxiety just think of this quote and hopefully it can help keep you grounded.

EDIT: a lot of people are posting saying that this quote is bullshit and that it won't actually help anyone with anxiety. Obviously I didn't post this thinking ""people are going to read this quote and their anxiety will vanish!"" It's meant to be a simple observational quote that may help you think of the reality of the situation. It's not meant to instantly make your anxiety go away, or even to help it in some cases. I thought it was a nice quote worth sharing. There's really no need to call it ""fucking bullshit"" and things of the like. ",65,2016-06-23 06:43:56 EDT-0400

After a great day,  last night I got really bad,  I spent an evening with friends half asleep half having nightmares. And throw in a bit of staring aimlessly into space and not responding to anyone or anything. He spent the whole time just touching me and stroking me and telling me it will be okay.

494,Sister tried to commit suicide and my religious dad is crazy,"My younger sis and I have been raised in a strict religious home. I developed depressions and both GAD and social anxiety. As an adult I was finally able to get treated for it but through out my teenage years I had to endure my parents advice to ""pray it away"". 

My sister is going through the same as me, but she is more defiant about it. Tonight, she tried to commit suicide by taking 30 pills of ibuprofen. All my dad could say is that ""she is being a rebel"". We are the hospital and they wanted to transfer to a psychiatric hospital. My dad insisted that we did not believe in psychiatrists and that he was not allowing to take her. 

They told him that they would have to get the police involved as she was in danger to herself. It was then that he backed. I'm all riled up. WTF DAD. Your daughter almost died and you are here with your proud religious shit????! He still can't see that after my depression and now my sisters that maybe things at home aren't so holy and perfect as he thought?! 

My anxiety is through the roof right now. But thankfully she will be on her way to see a psychiatrist tomorrow morning. Unfortunately my dad won't say yes to medication so here is hoping that other therapies help.",7,2016-06-27 10:11:29 EDT-0400

I put my phone down and leave the room for about 5 minutes. Within that time he's called me twice and left two text messages, one saying ""I'm going on vacation next week can you call me immediately?"" and one three minutes later that said ""Guess not."" Before I get a chance to even look at my phone he calls me again, I don't recognize his number right off because I don't have it saved as a contact and I accidentally answer then reject the call. Then he texts me ""U just hung up on me"" and I finally read all the other texts and stuff. His prices are very high. I didn't like how within three minutes he replied with a snarky remark, maybe thats petty. I just told him not to worry about it and to enjoy his vacation. He didn't get the hint, called me like two more times and texted me to say I had to call him to make an appointment (I generally let my Dad handle the scheduling because he helps me pay for my sessions). I said plainly as possible I didn't want to schedule an appointment anymore and to please stop calling my phone. He told me he would ""tell my father about this"". I'm 20 years old, I get that I look very young, but I took offense to this comment. I also felt it damaged the integrity of the privilege I'm supposed to have as one of his clients, it felt like he was threatening me with the only thing he had because I did something he didn't agree with. All of this unfolded in the span of 10 minutes. Was I too reactionary in how I handled this? Am I being petty? Its just I have another therapist I often see who would never do something like this, and I'm confused. 

edit: I got a ton of responses to this post I didn't expect. It seems to be unanimous that this was bad business by my therapist. I appreciate everyone's comments. Sorry I couldn't reply to everyone. ",25,2016-06-25 03:05:34 EDT-0400

498,Rant...What to do when you can't deal anymore ?,"I'm not sure why I'm posting this. But it's 4am here and it's another sleepless night for me. I can't sleep through a night  and have at least 2 nights a week with literally 0 hrs  of sleep. I simply cannot handle my brain not shutting up. Only times I ever feel calm anymore is if I take a sedative and then feel loopy for a while which I hate. I've tried to fake it till I make it per say. Try really hard to be happy until I become happy but  I can't do it. Technically my life is 100 times better than it has been in the past having lived  in unsafe places and rough conditions. I have amazing friends and family...some of the best people in the world. And I cannot stop being scared  of how they will suffer one day, pass away etc. 
I'm completely stuck and I just want it to end. I'm tempted to just stay home or somewhere and try to live out the rest of my life as I don't want to commit suicide or anything like that because I'm too scared and I don't want to hurt anyone. Basically I don't want to live and I'm too scared to die and I don't know what the alternative is anymore. I'm just so tired.  
My spouse always tells me, worry when shit hits the fan....and it makes sense to me (he's the greatest soul btw). Why am I spending beautiful days scared of what ifs. And it makes sense for brief periods of time and I have clarity and peace for a few mins but it never ever lasts. But I also find it hard to believe that my anxiety is an imbalance...It feels like it's very real considering how horrible the world is and how much suffering happens...why shouldn't I be anxious.  It makes me sad that my parents did everything and sacrificed everything with the main goal being their children's happiness yet I can't be happy...I just fake it. 
So I guess with this incoherent rant I'm just looking for some words of wisdom and comfort. I don't like talking about this to a lot of other people in my life as unfortunately a lot of them are dealing with their own huge stressors and I feel bad complaining to them...thank God for the Internet where I can just post a random rant  and vent",9,2016-06-25 12:10:18 EDT-0400
499,My anxiety and intrusive thoughts paralyze me and make it impossible for me to do anything. Please help me!,"Hi everybody. I really need help. I've been meaning to post about this for a while and I haven't been able to get myself to do it, and you'll see why if you read on. 

Thank you to anybody who actually reads this. Please help me. I'm desperate. 

So I'll tell you what my life situation is currently, and hopefully someone will be able to help me. 

I'm currently on summer break from college. I'm living with my dad. My dad and I have a pretty good relationship for the most part but for some reason talking to him really stresses me out lately. He never (read: very often) understands what I'm trying to say, and talking to him always (read: often) makes me feel worse. He always assumes that I don't know what I'm talking about, which is really insulting and just makes me feel really frustrated. Obviously I've tried talking to him about all this many times but he doesn't really listen or it has no effect. 

I don't have any friends here. And even my dad is gone most of the day on most days, so I rarely talk to anybody and am alone with my thoughts most of the time. 

So here's the main reason I wanted to write this: My anxiety keeps me from doing anything that gives me joy. The main thing that I really enjoy is watching movies. I'm probably the biggest film buff you've ever met. I get so much spiritual fulfillment and joy from an amazing movie. You have to understand this because it's very different from how a lot of people just kinda half-assedly watch netflix to entertain themselves and kill time and then a month later don't even remember the title of the movie. This is different: it is my passion.

But my anxiety keeps me from watching movies. I compulsively worry about not having the perfect movie-watching experience. I'm worried that I'm going to ruin it. I know logically that this is absurd but as you guys know that doesn't mean shit. I worry about worrying and this keeps me so in my head that I can't even keep my attention on the movie and completely zone out and miss it and therefore ACTUALLY DO ruin it. It's a self-fulfilling prophecy. It's an impossible dilemma. 

I am literally constantly – I'm going to say it again – CONSTANTLY worrying about stuff. I worry about getting worried. I'm so busy worrying all day that I can't even devote my attention to anything. 

It keeps me from doing anything productive too but what bothers me most is that it ruins everything I try to do to relax or have fun. I can't relax or have fun anymore. I want to cry but I can't do that either. I feel trapped and unable to do anything. I feel like the pressure keeps building and building and never lets off and I'll never explode or somehow feel better. 

I feel so claustrophobic. Even in my room with the door closed I feel like I can never be alone and have peace. 

I currently have a house in the town where I go to college. My housemate and best friend is already living there. I could be living there right now but the reason I'm here is that my parents just got divorced last year and my dad is not doing so well and it really comforts him to hang out with me. I NEED to get out of this house. I know that if I went to live with my best friend in my own house I would feel so much better, but I feel like I can't because of my dad. 

But the longer this goes on and the worse it gets the more I think I need to just do this for myself. My dad doesn't know what I'm going through. I feel like a caged animal. But god I would feel really bad to leave my dad. 

Anyway I didn't just write this to talk about whether I should move out or not. Even when I'm out of the house and living with my best friend/roommate my anxiety is definitely better, but still bad. However I do think I'll talk to my dad about this when he gets home. God he might be mad or really sad though. I guess I'll just try to tell him everything I said here except leave out the stuff about him. 

I know you guys will try to say to just work out the communication issues with my dad but I've been trying for years and he just doesn't get it so that is not the solution. Obviously nothing is impossible but some things are very implausible. Just take my word on this. 

I'm super lonely too. I know it's a cliché but no one understands me. I have good friends and a good dad but I still don't have anybody I can be really open with. I really just want more than anything else to have someone to love. I just mean a really close friend – no possibility of a girlfriend. I feel like that would make all of this other shit bearable and I would be able to handle it. I've posted this before and people tell me to love myself. I try but I can't really do it. I know it will probably come in time but right now I just can't see it. 

People on reddit tell me to go out and do shit in the community but 
1) I can't drive. I have no idea why. I've been driving with someone else in the car for 5 years and hundreds upon hundreds of hours but I still can't drive for shit. I have no idea why. I have an appointment with some kind of brain doctor in a few days to see if we can figure out what's wrong with me.
2) What the fuck would I do? Pottery? I've never played and have no interest in sports.
3) Why would the people there be any different? What are the chances I'm going to meet someone there who could be my best friend?

Besides, I already know what my passion is. I love movies and my dream is to make them myself. I know I can do it. But right now I'm stalled. I need to get this 3-minute short done by August 10. I've never done this before so I'm nervous about it, even while at the same time being very excited and optimistic. I don't know what it's going to be about so I've got to figure that out. 

People tell me to get a new hobby or exercise or meditate or do any number of things and I really really try to but I'm just too fucking stressed to get myself to do anything. My anxiety totally paralyzes me and keeps me from doing anything at all. Especially things which are supposed to be pleasant and fun. I really need to solve the anxiety problem first. Telling me about things I could do doesn't help if my anxiety completely keeps me from doing them. 

People also tell me I should be on medication but that's not an option. 

I guess I could try to find another therapist but I just kinda think it's bullshit. But my school offers some free counseling so once school starts back up I'll do that again. 

So I guess that's all I had to say. Thank you to anyone who reads this. I appreciate any help I can get. ",8,2016-06-28 01:48:27 EDT-0400

503,"I just had my biggest panic attack, went to the hospital, here is what i learned from it.","Hello everyone, its 2 am here and i just got home, today i had a dinner with my parents, i live alone so they came to see me. I was just starting to eat my food when i noticed a strange feeling in my head, I start to get anxious because this feeling in my head usually triggers my panic attacks, but I try my best to control it.

I make it through the dinner, my mom kept asking me if everything was alright, because Iooked concerned about something, i just said im fine. In the car going home I start to get a really bad feeling, like i have a brain tumor or im having a stroke, this feeling escalares to a point where i just snap, i say to my mom ""please help me"", i feel the left side of my face to go heavy and numb, and i just go fucking crazy, i knew i was having a stroke for sure, i screamed a lot, and i said ""im going to die here"" my dad stops the car, i just scream ""hospital"", we get there, im not sure how im still alive, and long story short they gave me a pill to calm myself down, i get a brain scan that showed i had no problems at all.

I am now at home, they prescribed me some pills and i am going to see a therapist, I hope this is the start of a new life for me, anxiety has been with me for a long time, and I finally had the courage to admit i have a problem, if you too live with this disease, please seek help. Im still recovering a bit from the panic attack, but now i know i have no problem, and that it cant kill me.

510,Does anyone else have a constant sense of impending doom?,"Today I took the day off and went on a day trip to the mountains with my parents, which is usually something I would really enjoy. However, I was distracted by this horrible pit in my stomach the whole time and couldn't enjoy any of it. I kept having intrusive thoughts about how someday my parents - especially my dad, who I'm somewhat closer to - would be gone someday, and I had better enjoy this while I can before I'll never be able to experience it again. Of course, these thoughts had the exact opposite of their desired effect and I was anxious and sad the whole time. Lately this has been happening more and more; thoughts about death and mortality, about how temporary everything is, and also a suffocating sense of dread that something terrible and life altering is going to happen very soon. Even though my dad is in his early seventies, both of my parents are in good health, so I know that my worries are unfounded on that front, but it's still something that plagues me daily. It's gotten to the point where I can't sleep, kept awake by my fears of the future. I'm self medicating and trying to spend every spare moment I can asleep, just to avoid these thoughts. I'm in my very early twenties, I shouldn't be this consumed by thoughts and fears of death. I feel like I'm going insane. Help?",44,2016-10-11 05:56:38 EDT-0400
511,I miss depression,"Never thought I'd say that. I genuinely, whole-heartedly miss depression. I was clinically depressed and experienced all that comes with that for over a decade. I didn't want to live. I didn't think I could possibly be in more agony than I was then. Boy was I wrong. 

The anxiety started with a bang. My first panic attack. Knew I was about to die. Thankfully my best friend was there who has GAD otherwise I would have called an ambulance. Then nightly panic attacks, because I feared panic attacks. Great cycle. Thanks Amygdala.

Now, I might have a panic attack once every few weeks. But the baseline of my daily experience is general anxiety. Any situations I can't bail from if I need to sets it off. I can't have a shower without being on edge. I go to work for an hour then leave because I am going to pass out, I just know it. The health anxiety - before my first panic attack I barely thought about my health. Now I do, nearly every second of every day. I'm going to have a heart attack, a stroke, a brain aneurysm. Hell, maybe all three at once. I am constanly on the edge of panic - sometimes I'm distracted enough that it recedes, but it's always in the background, ready to be triggered by some small non-event that normal people deal with daily with ease. 

I am always experiencing an adrenaline rush or adrenaline fatigue. The only solace is sleep. It takes me over an hour of a racing heart beat and intense body rushes to fall asleep. I drink. I abuse painkillers. It helps, barely. 

So I miss depression. Desperately. I'm far too anxious to feel depressed. Anxiety is an immediate danger, it saps all of my energy and demands all of my focus. I don't have time to ruminate and wallow when I'm constantly battling my fight or flight response. 

Whilst my depression was a black cloud, a weight on my shoulders, a heaviness in my soul - anxiety is a wild relentless storm, pummeling me, it is a crushing weight in my chest, it is tearing apart my soul and sanity. There is no comparison between the two.

I hope one day I will be calm enough to be depressed again. It is a foe I understand, that I can face, that I can sometimes escape. Thanks for listening. If you relate to this, I wish you didn't, I'm sorry your life is like this, I love you.

Thats when I realized that I drank more pop than normal that day.  I connected the dots and realized too much caffeine makes my thoughts race.  Now I drink only one pop in the morning and nothing with caffeine afterwards.

I've helped a couple people on reddit before.  They cut their caffeine out of their diet and now they no longer have anxiety symptoms.  They normally seem surprised it turns it off like a light switch.  It doesn't help everyone, but it helps some people a great deal.",28,2016-10-10 23:09:12 EDT-0400

522,Empty Friday Nights Fuck Me Up,"Hey. 

Not really sure how to start this because it's lame af and stupid. 

When Friday night rolls around and I have no plans..I start to feel lame, lonely, and incredibly sad. Let me preface this by saying that usually I enjoy alone time, especially working 8-5 M-F a night to myself is night because I can go to bed early if I want or read all night and it never bothers me. Something about a no planned Friday night though, really puts me into an anxious sad state of mind. Maybe it's because I feel like everyone has plans on a Friday night and here's my lame ass just chillen with nothing to do. 

How lame is this? I feel like a fucking retard for feeling this way. Why is being alone some times awesome and others (like this) make me feel so anxiously depressed? 

Anyone else deal with something similar? How do you cope?

After about 20 minutes I lost all control of my arms and it took all my strength to stop them swinging around. My hands were clenched so tight I physically couldn't open them. I was shaking violently and was extremely dizzy. My face was extremely tight and my jaw was locked in a slightly open mouth position.  I had severe pins and needles all over my entire body, and my vision was extremely shakey. It took a nurses (I was at art therapy) about 45 minutes to get me out of it.

Everything hurts so bad. My chest hurts. I can't stop crying. I'm having a panic attack, but I've never had one this painful.

My boyfriend broke up with me a week ago and this relationship was, and is, so important to me. I've never felt this way with anyone. He doesn't want to talk to me, but he did say that he's going to find me a replacement and that he will sleep with as many women as the number of texts I've sent him, which is currently 10, and only after that he'll consider talking to me. He knows he's the only person I have in my life since I don't have any friends and he knows how much I need to stay in touch with him - since we were so close for 2 years and he was my only support.

I'm so hurt by him, by how he can say something like that to me.
I feel so bad, I've never felt this horrible in my entire life. I've never cried so much over anything or anyone. I don't even know what to do, I don't know how to survive this. I can't function, I can hardly eat and sleep. My entire body hurts.
I don't even have anyone to talk to, I don't have any friends. I just want someone to hug me and say that it'll pass and that I don't need to want to die right now.

533,"If you are suffering today, please read this!","Hello,

I try to be as active as possible on this subreddit to pass on encouragement and advice to others; even posting myself occasionally. I just wanted to pass a message on to others as it has helped me a lot.

When you begin to have a bout of crippling anxiety you should take a moment and write two things you like about yourself. They can be large things like ""I believe I am a kind person"", or something as simple as ""I cook really good stir-fry's"". Sounds dumb but personally after about 6 months I mounted up many many pages of these. The only rule about myself is I cannot repeat anything. What this has done for me (along with medication and prof therapy) has allowed me to find some good within myself in my darkest hours. As you know, when you are overwhelmingly anxious you feel so trapped. ""Nothing will help, nothing will change, this will never go away..."", I see this feeling of fear in a lot of posts, and I just want to tell you, YOU ARE NOT ALONE.

You are beautiful. You are unique. You are special. YOU are the master of your own universe. Sometimes you will feel like the wall in front of you is so high that you can't climb it. You look at it and think ""hell.. i'm going to spend the rest of my life trying to get over this thing...""

But the truth is- what they don't tell you is the higher you climb, the better the view becomes. I think our society paints an image of people living life in constant euphoria and happiness. We see movies, television shows, news articles; all looking at how brilliant others lives are and we wonder, why can't I have that? But in reality, everyone has there own demons. NEVER beat yourself up because you struggle with Anxiety. You are braver then you know. You are stronger then you realize. And you WILL get past those dark moments, and it makes the ""bright"" ones that much better.

In the past 4 years I have been so low that suicide came to mind (which was terrifying), but I've felt moments of pure euphoria and happiness.. however brief they may be. But the one thing I have learned from my own illness is that denying yourself the right to seek help will only make things worse. We all fear that if we tell the people around us the extent of our illness that they will be repulsed or overwhelmed.. I used to think this is part of the illness alone but I think it attests to how separated our society has become from our own emotions. As a young boy, I was raised to think that tears were a sign of weakness, and emotions were something to be ignored and bottled up. But no more am I going to allow myself to suffer in silence. I am soooo far from perfect. I've made mistakes that have hurt me and even worse hurt those I care about- but this does not define me. I have days where I can't leave bed, can't talk to others... this does not define me. I have days where I truly feel that life is too much to handle and it will never get better- but this does not define me. Don't let your illness become how you define yourself. 

I have the utmost respect for EVERYONE on this subreddit, and I have not seen any other reddit community that is this supportive. I came to this subreddit in a moment of despair, made a post- and had complete strangers display that they cared about me. It blew my mind. How could these people who I never met extend so much kindness towards me ? It's because when we are alone we feel trapped and helpless. But together even in our darkest moments we have a community that understands what we are going through. I don't expect any replies to this, this is merely me extending my gratitude to all of those who participate in this Subreddit. 

Thank you everyone who subscribes to this, and I want to let you know that whether or not you have been told this- your participation here changes the lives of others. There are people here with no one else to turn to, and I think it is beautiful that everyone here opens there arms for them in their time of need.

534,The Dreaded Interview & Job Hunt,"My friends, I so wanted to post here a week ago when I was shaking and trying to shoo away the feelings of undeserved opportunities along with the agony of even having to go through with it, but i did it. I did an interview. 

After all the pain and pent up stress I gave myself, all the regretting of even applying in the first place, along the mind set of ""how COULD they ring me to arrange an interview?? did they read the wrong CV????"" All the thoughts that seem to go hand in hand with anxiety about not even wanting the job, how homelessness was a good alternative because I wouldn't have to work and interact with people! How every job must be exactly the same environment as my old job, which in retrospect, sales + anxiety = not the best combination I have found.

 The aftermath of finishing the interview, being the first person to be interviewed and convincing myself I would never have a chance because clearly all the people after me would be 100x better and more friendly than myself, and well versed to the job, and why would they want to hire ME anyway? I wouldn't hire me! BUT after it all, I did it. I got the job. Anxiety is like that nasty girl in high school always whispering things about yourself that aren't true, or very warped to existence. I hope in my new job I can leave a bit of that stress behind, the people seem lovely and the job is very low stress and casual office stuff.

If I can do it, so can you! I believe in you all, and wish you the best of luck if you're still job hunting, it can be done! And not all your experiences will equate to what your jobs in the future may be like. Stay positive :) ",13,2016-03-13 19:53:04 EDT-0400

545,Just wanted to share my experience getting help- and getting over the anxiety of getting help,"I am 22F, who has suffered a mix of anxiety and skin-picking OCD since, at least puberty. Pretty consistently throughout life I've had anxiety attacks and meltdowns, which often involve self-deprecating, negative thought cycles, picking my face until it bleeds, pacing around, and inevitably doing nothing at all (not getting out of bed for like two days straight). My ""triggers"" feel like things like most everybody should be able to deal with without breaking down- a bad memory, social interaction, money, etc. 


I developed a pretty decent set of coping mechanisms on my own. I really didn't want to have to talk to someone about ""what I do,"" because even to me it seems **crazy**. My repertoire includes: long-distance running, biking, breathing exercises, daily journaling, and allowing myself decompress time before and after social events.


Sometimes those things all worked, and sometimes they didn't. Sometimes I felt like a functional person (and adult), and sometimes I felt like everything in the world was wrong and I was alone and soon my facade of a life would come crashing down.


When I was 19, I decided to go see a counselor at my university. It was awful. It was always uncomfortable talking to my therapist because he was constantly trying to fit my behavior into some unfitting label. In the end he admitted that OCD and anxiety were out of his expertise. 


So, obviously that wasn't so great. I waited another three years before seeking help again. I had **huge** reservations about it, and was scared of pretty much every step. What drove me forward was: talking to my Mom (someone I trust) about it; the fact that I clearly wasn't going to ""grow out"" of these problems; the fact that my coping wasn't working that well anymore, and anxiety was debilitating daily life with me missing classes and falling behind, worrying about losing my job, etc. 


The second counselor I saw was much better. If you've had a terrible time with therapy, I can only encourage you to try again. This time, my therapist was a woman who listened patiently. She also didn't know quite what I meant when describing ""anxious picking meltdowns,"" but instead of trying to label that, she encouraged me to keep talking so she could understand better. She recommended me to a physician (also within the university health center), who was very familiar with patients with high anxiety. 


We discussed options for medication, and I expressed my fears about side effects. I told her that I had been dealing with ""raw"" anxiety for a long time. It's a difficult but familiar factor in life. Changing that by some unknown degree, with meds, is terrifying. I think this was really important to recognize. 


I'm now a month and a half into 40mg of fluoxetine a day. Not terrible long, but I could cry for how drastic the shift was. Within a week, it was like my anxiety was just smeared away. I found myself getting ""nervous"" before social interaction instead of ""anxiously terrified."" The OCD- the skin picking, did not just miraculously disappear (of course, since it's partly habitual), but my urges to pick and instances of it have been reduced drastically. As well as meds, I have been meeting weekly with my new therapist and physician. I'm terribly lucky since I can do this through the whole university network, for minimum expense on my student account. That said, I really really encourage looking into all the options out there, for meds or not... a huge factor in moving forward was being forced to articulate, and talk about these issues. When they're out in the open, suddenly it doesn't feel like this huge dark secret anymore.


As far as side effects go: I still feel like myself. I still have a full range of emotions and don't have a ""fog."" I haven't gained any weight. My mind feels bright and awake, I **care** about daily life again.  I HAVE had trouble sleeping... which is a problem. But before, I was able to sleep 14+ hours a day. Now I just have to adapt to more like, ~7 a day. 


**tl;dr: Lifelong anxiety and OCD; sought help for the second time and everything went better than expected. Now take low-dose fluoxetine.**



This is only my personal experience, and of course everyone has different circumstances, and certainly different reactions to medication. I just wanted to share as a ""success story,"" to encourage anyone to get help in a way that is feasible for them. Thank you!

The past couple of weeks I have just completely put it out of my mind and told myself ""I'll start tomorrow"", but now I've run out of time to procrastinate. 


Last semester, I just didn't do papers/assignments/exams that gave me anxiety, and I ended up failing a class and landing myself on academic probation.

Panicking as we speak. The last few weeks have been awful. Financially I'm broke, my car is broken so can't drive which usually calms me down. I have 4 months left of funding on my PhD which will take 6 months to complete if I didn't have an anxiety disorder. Worst of all a very close friend of mine killed himself three weeks ago (funeral was Friday). This led me to take a cocktail of drugs and alcohol to try and cope, but when I asked my friends for help they ignored me and haven't spoke to me since.sincerely

552,Shoutout to the user who posted about magnesium recently - a heartfelt thank you.,"I'd been feeling like crap for years. The doctor always tested my iron and thyroid, test always came back normal. These past few weeks I was spiralling downward feeling worse and worse, and on the verge of having no hope. I would cry every night, shake from panic at placement, insomnia, nightmares, puffy eyes. I felt like I was dying. I saw your post, found the one magnesium tab in the back of my mom's  cupboard, drank it down and: the relief was unimaginable. I'm now the proud owner of a tub of magnesium powder, and continue to feel more amazing each day since. Thanks for thinking to share, it changed my health 180 degrees.

Edit: hi everyone! I have a lot of responses asking what and how much I've taken. I just wanted to post to remind everyone that medical advice over the internet is good, but should be always taken with a grain of salt! If you think you have low magnesium, but are taking lots of medications or are just unsure how much or what kind to take- please please call your doctor. They know your situation, and can give the best advice. Everything you take (vitamins, meds, even just water) has an effect on the body, and can be helpful or harmful so it's best to consult a professional about interactions or side effects. Treat supplaments (even though they're 'natural' like medications, because they can and will interact with meds, and have side effects. Especially electrolytes like magnesium or potassium which can have cardiac effects if thrown out of whack)

Edit number 2: found the post I was speaking about :)

557,I ordered pizza and got it from the delivery man!,"Ordering was rough especially when I could hear my own voice reading the credit card number. Plus the girl on the other end was nice but it felt like she was judging me. The pizza guy arrived early and I raced up stairs for change. I stuttered a bit while talking, fumbled with the change, scribbled a ""signature"", tried to give him back the pizza while taking the receipt, and then tried to give him the receipt when he wanted the pen. Then he left and my dog went after him and wouldn't come when I called so he ended up walking back to the house with my dog trailing him. I also was wearing a dirty shirt that I've been wearing for a bit over a week straight and pajama bottoms.

558,"6 months no human contact, are the after effects permanent?","So for whatever reason, I couldn't leave my apartment for 6 months straight. I guess it was some kind of phobia or severe anxiety.

I had zero support and couldn't pick up a phone because I didn't have one.

Anyways, I recently got myself to a hospital and was discharged and harassed then abruptly sent home.

Today, having had enough of this bullshit, and wanting to take things into my own hands, I forced myself to go outside. It wasn't broad daylight, but it was evening and there were quite a few people up and about, so I consider it a step forward.

There was a problem however. While I did not faint and have an adverse reaction, I was acting *odd*.

For example, the way I walked was very weird. I could feel it. It was like I was bent over, or limping. This wasn't due to back pain, just me being stiff from anxiety. I was also very sketchy and twitchy, looking at people funny, and avoiding eye contact.

Not everyone let me be. Some people laughed and pointed, some people avoided me noticeably (they would literally step on to the street to avoid being on the sidewalk with me as they crossed my path). Some people clung onto their items tighter. I felt like crap.

 But this is to be expected after nearly NO CONTACT WHATSOEVER for all this time.

My question is this: Are these effects permanent? Will they wear off? 

I'm not really a suicidal person, but I cannot imagine living the rest of my life like this. This is a little too much.

EDIT: Thank you all SO much for your words of advice and shared insight. It's great to see so much good intention in one place. I've constructed an exposure ladder around an hour ago and i'm going to follow it till I can dance around in broad daylight while keeping a straight face. Stay strong everyone!

I was at the mall yesterday and when walking into the store the first sales associate said hi, I panicked and instead of speaking, I responded in sign. Shortly, another employee came up to assist me (thinking to myself ""well great, you have to continue this""). She was by my side the entire time I was in the store doing her best to decipher my sign language. Needless to say it was a short visit, I briskly left there deciding I was never to return.

569,Today my anxiety beat me.,"Long story short I have some pretty terrible anxiety. When I had health insurance I was seeing a doctor and taking pills, but everybody complained to me that I didn't need pills so I stopped taking them and let the insurance expire. 

Today I went to a fast food place to grab a bite to eat, drive through. Person ahead of me ordered like 30 dollars worth of food, I ordered just a regular meal. 

Get my food, and proceed to pull behind car that was ahead of me. They aren't moving. I wait a little bit, thining they're just texting. Still not moving. Still not moving. I get a little closer, still not moving.

At this point my heart rate is increasing and I'm becoming flustered, so I send a little love honk their way. Still not moving. Not even acknowledging my honk. By now I'm becoming increasingly flustered and my heart rate has increased, I start wildly throwing my hands in a very animated fashion and proceed to send a few more love honks. The lady yells something at me, but I couldn't hear it. I yell back and tell her to move out of the way.

By now the people behind me have gotten food, and since I am not going anywhere, they can't go anywhere. 

There is another lane to use, but we're all so squished together that nobody can get to it.

It's at this point where things just kinda blur. I proceed to lay on my horn. Like, non stop. Someone steps out of the car and I proceed to go into full panic mode. Thinking I'm about to get jumped or someone's gonna try to injure me. I roll up my windows and lock all my doors and proceed to hold my hands above my head

Instead, the person explains that they are simply waiting on their food, and they were told to pull upto this spot. 

It's at this moment, where everything just seems to reset, and return to normal levels. My heart rate slows, my breathing calms down, and I know the person could see the confused, puzzled look on my face, as if I didn't know where I even was. 

Finally their food is delivered and they proceed to go on their way, but not before the lady hurls some slurs at me. 

I went home and honestly threw my meal away, didn't even eat it.

Today my anxiety beat me. The last time it did this, I walked out of my job cold turkey, and that was months ago. 

My brain was so fixated and concentrated on a specific thing, that I didn't even consider they may just be waiting for food. And then what I like to call the aftershock came. Oh I'm a failure, I suck, I'm stupid, I'm never going to do anything important, I don't have a future planned, etc.

When I was home I drank 5 out of 6 beers, and proceeded to emotionally dump all over Facebook, which wasn't perhaps the best idea, but I have literally zero people to talk to in my personal life about  this kind of thing.

Anyway, apologize for writing the mini-book.  ",6,2016-02-02 07:31:36 EST-0500

It sucks cuz when I'm going through my days of no anxiety I feel great and I feel confident, but there is always the thought in the back of my mind that the day or two of bad anxiety is coming. Usually when it does come I'll feel myself getting anxious at night and then waking up with anxiety. I can control it for the most part and push through it, but sometimes (like today where I skipped my night class and stayed at home all day) I just can't bring myself to go about the day. 

At first these days of bad anxiety made me feel like I was having a setback and that it send me back down that spiral I was in last year and years before. But the way I've been dealing with this is by telling myself that I just came off a few great days and that this one day is just that...one day. So I try to remind myself that it isn't necessarily a setback that I have bad anxiety today, but it's more of an obstacle and kinda just ""one of those days"". It doesn't mean it's going to be like this for now on, and I think that's helped me a lot because I fell fast down the anxiety hole in the past (last year in particular) but now I feel like I have a lot more control on myself. I guess I'm just wondering if anyone can relate to this and what strategies you use for when it happens. 

I just feel a little guilty for lying around all day and not going to my class and I also had some other stuff I could have gotten done that I didn't. So any advice or kind words or really anything would be appreciated!",21,2016-10-26 04:59:15 EDT-0400

584,"I'm sick of hearing ""Stop Caring What others Think, and be whatever You want to be.""","It's something I'm really tired of hearing of. It's something I get told by those close to me when it comes to hobbies I actually enjoy and generally getting out of the house and making friends. Each time I always say that I wish it were just that easy to change. If I had the choice, I wouldn't constantly be alone at home or afraid to put out what I enjoy to the public, and stand up for myself when someone treats me terribly instead of breaking down. The fear of being judged is just so strong. I know if I say I've been trying, it won't be believed because I have no way to prove it. It's thing that occurs in my head after all. No matter how much I try to explain, it doesn't seem to change a thing. 

I think a major part of my anxiety is my fear of being judged by others. I think it may stem from my past where family and people around me would nitpick about the way I hold myself or the way I act. They were usually all really small comments but I feel like they've just stacked up. Now I'm at a point where I want friends, to talk to family, and be proud of something I do...but once I try, I freeze up and my head just gets filled with these 'What if' thoughts. It's not like I visibly have a anxiety or panic attack either, which is both a good and bad thing I guess.

Honestly, I'm just tired of comments like the one in the title and ""Just Relax"". They don't help at all. If I could do those things in an instant, I'd chose to be a kind or chill extrovert and do what I've always wanted to do and get a job, but no. I'm still struggling to fight my thoughts and force myself to not to externally freak out when I interact with people that I know don't care about me like cashiers.

587,A way to stop unwanted and intrusive thoughts,"One of the most troubling issues with anxiety is the constant flow of intrusive and unwanted thoughts in our minds. They flow with such force that it seems unstoppable.

Most often, these are thoughts that can range from mildly unpleasant to utterly scary! When I was in the throes of anxiety, my mind would be beset by the same intrusive thoughts every day. I would constantly think “Am I going insane?” While another part of me would wonder “Will it always be like this?”

Sometimes, the thoughts won’t even make any sense. It would be nonsensical. Just a fusion of unrelated words and concepts traveling at lightning speed inside my head.

It felt overwhelming and as if this wasn’t enough already, I would have music stuck in my head all the time. Sometimes, it would play awful top 40 songs that I would never explicitly choose to listen to otherwise!

If you are suffering from OCD thoughts, do not worry! You are not alone. We can learn how to make them go away. OCD, which stands for *Obsessive Compulsive Disorder* is when we have, among other things, an obsession with certain thought patterns and feel a compulsive urge to do something about it.

In most cases, that something we do is to find different ways to distract our attention away from such thoughts. We switch on the TV, put on our headphones and listen to music or keep checking our mobile phones regularly. This may provide some relief, but often, these thoughts almost always return.

A cure always starts with an understanding. Once you understand why your mind is riddled with unwanted or intrusive thoughts, you’ll be able to make them go away. It usually won’t happen overnight, but with patience and understanding, your mind will eventually learn to rest, and the intrusive thoughts will be extinguished.

**Mind Agitated**

Anxiety is a state where our mind is never at rest. It is constantly fired up. Even when we feel like we are resting for a few minutes, we are hyper vigilant in the background and scan for internal and external threats.

Because of the mind-body connection, when we are in this mental state, our body starts to produce adrenaline in excess. When there is excessive adrenaline, it starts to affect the way we think.

Adrenaline agitates the mind. When we are in danger, we need to think and act fast. The mind feels energized and spends this excess energy by firing off many thoughts that are aimed to tackle the threat. But when there is no immediate outside threat, as it is mostly the case with the vast majority of people with anxiety (how often do we encounter a hungry lion on our daily commute?), the adrenaline powered mind starts to fire off thoughts as a way to expend the excess mental energy.

But when there is no immediate outside threat, as it is mostly the case with the vast majority of people with anxiety (how often do we encounter a hungry lion on our daily commute?), the adrenaline powered mind starts to fire off thoughts as a way to expend the excess mental energy.

What happens now is that we start fighting or try to run away from these dreadful and intrusive thoughts. This creates additional stress, which produces more adrenaline. Remember, the amount of adrenaline secreted in your body is directly related to your stress level. This excess adrenaline, when it reaches the brain, energizes the mind even more and the cycle thus perpetually continues.

**An Analogy**

By nature, water in a bowl is still. Our mind is similar, such that when we are healthy, it remains still and takes care of the essential functions of day to day activities. Stress-induced adrenaline is similar to dropping a stone in a bowl of still water. When the stone is dropped into the water, you’ll start to see ripples on the surface of the water.

The drop of this stone has energized the water, which now creates ripples to expend that excess energy so that it can come to stillness once again. As long as we keep dropping the stones or disturbing the water, there will always be ripples on its surface. The more energy we apply to it, the bigger the ripples are. This is similar to what happens in our head. With more and more adrenaline being pumped in, our mind tries to spend this excess energy in the form of thoughts (just like the ripples on the water’s surface).

By understanding this mechanism we can now come to a solution. To stop these unwanted or intrusive thoughts, we need to stop adding more stress into the mix. We need to break this adrenaline-thought cycle.

**Breaking the cycle**

The easiest way to break this adrenaline-thought cycle is to stop the adrenaline from being secreted over and over again. You do that by letting your body and mind know that these thoughts are not a threat.

When we experience intrusive or unwanted OCD thoughts, our first instinct is to fight them or try to run away from them. This is why we try to distract ourselves in myriad different ways or keep fighting such intrusive thoughts.

When we fight or try to flee from the thoughts of our minds we are sending a signal to the body that we are facing a threat. By doing so, we add stress to the body and mind. Our mind cannot hide from or fight itself. Doing so only produces additional stress. This additional stress produces more adrenaline, which keeps these thoughts going.

On the other hand, when we stop fighting and instead of running away from such thoughts, remain internally steady, we send a signal to our body that the current situation is not a threat and that it can stop producing the excess adrenaline. When this adrenaline stops, the mind stops becoming agitated. This leads to the eventual extinction of intrusive and unwanted OCD thoughts.

Next time, when you have such thoughts, try to face them. Know that they are just excess mental energy and that they cannot do you any harm.

The nature of your mind is to return to stillness just like water. By letting these intrusive thoughts come and go as they wish and not fighting them, you are not considering them as a threat. When this happens, the body learns to stop secreting additional adrenaline in your blood.

Over time, the mind spends all of its excessive energy and returns to a place of stillness and stops producing these automatic unwanted thoughts.

One piece of caution is that this practice requires patience. Do not expect these intrusive and unwanted thoughts to stop immediately. It takes weeks or even months for the adrenaline in your bloodstream to return to normal levels. Give your body and mind all the time it needs to return to the healthy stillness which is their true nature.

590,Feeling guilty and Weak After taking a sick day due to anxiety,"So over the past couple of weeks my anxiety has been plaguing me with a vengeance, especially at night. It's led me to lose a lot of sleep and I've been generally quite exhausted. On top of that, I've just started juggling a part time job with a full time degree, so things are super busy.The best time ever for anxiety to rear its head!

Last night, things really came to a head. Despite being absolutely exhausted, I couldn't get to sleep until about 4am due to worry and feeling generally awful. I was due to be up for work at 6:30, but I just couldn't face it. I'm tired, I feel so anxious and ill, and I just can't function properly today. 

My workplace is generally very chill and I'm on a zero hours contract, so I was able to take the day off without any repercussions. However, I've been overcome with guilt all day about staying home. I feel weak, like a failure, and like everyone is judging me for letting this get the better of me. I'm scared that my SO (who works at the same place I do) will look down on me and be disappointed that I took the day off (even though he's been nothing but supportive of me in the past and I have no reason to think he'd react this way). I'm worried that anxiety isn't a ""serious"" enough issue to take days off, and that I'm just being pathetic.

I guess I'm just looking for some reassurance here. Has anyone else ever taken a sick day due to anxiety? Is it a ""good"" enough reason for me to take time off? I just feel so shitty right now!  ",43,2016-10-25 16:00:01 EDT-0400

593,Anyone else never talk about their problems to anyone because of anxiety?,"Nobody wants to be that person who's only a downer, and who only talks about themselves.

594,My own parents mocked me,"I refused to go to school today and told my mom. She came home from dropping my older sister off to school and went upstairs to talk to my step-dad. They had a conversation and this is exactly what they said. I'm referring myself as A.
""A doesn't want to go to school today""
""I'm sick of her shit""
""She says it's her anxiety and stuff""
""She should needs to take her meds""
""She's socially retarded""
""I think she's autistic""
""We should get her tested""
""I hate this""
""She ruins everything""
""When i invited her out with me she was really fucking awkward""
""We should just hospitalize her""
""School isn't even a big problem there's kids out there being raped by their parents""
Afterwards my stepdad begins to mock me when i was having anxiety over a conversation.
""When someone offered she wanted to watch tv she just said no and stood by me half the time""
""She embarrassed me a lot""

That's all i could remember.

Forgot to add on.
She assumes the reason i get bullied is because I say ignorant or unfunny comments and people find me quirky. The thing is i never talk at school, and i'll have conversations some times but it doesn't revolve around me not saying simple phrases. I've removed all communication from my friends as she requested, I didn't tell her so i'll let her see the outcome when you completely close out socialization 

Just thought i'd share that words hurt, especially by someone you thought loved you

595,My view on anxiety in a poem,"Anxiety: 

Is when everything is well now but you are afraid it's gonna change

Is when you are feeling beautiful but remember you will get old

Is when you are writing thinking of what people will think when they read it 

It's a tightness in the chest, a lump in the throat; It's like an elephant sitting on your forehead

Is expectation mixed with hopes deep fried on fear

Is the everyday feeling of not being enough

Is a reality and a dream; An illusion and a fact whiting the depts of human psique. ",4,2016-10-26 03:15:08 EDT-0400

597,"As an aspiring artist, anxiety is the absolute worst critic.","Sometimes it's just general demotivation, but it hits so much harder with anxiety. Take a drawing for example.

""You can't even make a straight line, why is it taking you so long to sketch, a professional would've already been at the color/shading process by now, just stop while you can.""

It's so emotionally draining. I'm not a bad artist either,  but the second I draw and screw up a line, I give up. 

I also make music on FL studio, and do little stories, so you can imagine how much of nightmare it is to mix a song, or making sure the sentence stucture in a story is correct.

I am a damn good employee, but I have been unemployed for over a year now because the level of job I am trying to get requires a solid interview.  It is keeping me from getting the type of job I have excelled at in the past.

It is a bit like evaluating all interview candidates by a 100 meter dash and being in a wheelchair.  No matter how hard you try you will still be at the bottom.

It is extremely frustrating.  I don't know what to do at this point.  I have a good degree, good experience, but just can't sell myself well enough in an interview to get an actual good job.  At this point I just want to be able to work and pay my bills.  It is only making my anxiety worse though.",86,2016-11-04 03:59:06 EDT-0400

607,A Technique that my doctor taught me to reduce anxiety,"Hey, my doctor taught me a technique to reduce anxiety. It's been working for me so far pretty well. 

There are two types of breathing. Breathing that makes your chest move and breathing that makes your stomach move. The one we want is the stomach breathing.

To learn how to do this, put one hand on your chest and one hand on your stomach. Now, try to breathe in a way that your chest doesn't move, but only your stomach moves in and out. You might notice that your breathing feels deeper than normal. This is what we want.

(Obviously you don't need to have your hand on your stomach, this is just how you might learn.)

Do this deep stomach breathing. It reduces anxiety because it lets you take in more air than normal. You can breathe like this 24/7 if you want. Practice it a few times a day at least. 

I hope this helps you.",30,2016-11-07 04:50:26 EST-0500
608,I'm 43 years old... And I am scared of answering the door on Halloween,"I dunno where this started. I used to LOVE Halloween.. at least, I loved the planning of a costume, going trick-or-treating.. getting to be out after dark, playing make believe, getting candy (seriously.. who would dislike getting candy?)

but I've always had this problem with anxiety. I called it 'being shy' back in the day.. I hated knocking on doors, I got 'performance anxiety' with figuring out what I was supposed to say, when I should say it, and so on. All these strangers doors...

Then at some point, one mean adult ruined Halloween for me, by snidely remarking that I was too old. After that, I stayed home, alone.

I wasn't a popular kid, never really got invited to parties or anything.. and being an only child with parents that worked during the day, I was often sitting at home alone as the sun set, and the youngest Trick-or-treaters started traversing the neighborhood with their parents.

They'd ring the doorbell, and I'd freeze up. My parents expected me to get on the 'giving out candy' bandwagon.. but I started freaking out. Usually my Mom would come home relatively early, and then once she was home, I was free to just hide in the livingroom.

For a while, I was involved in some Star Trek clubs (RL) and we usually had a little get-together, so I often found someplace else to be. Then shortly after, I moved to a little town in Oregon.

Up here, it rains a lot. And so the trick-or-treaters aren't too common. In fact, there have been years where we've bought candy, only to have no one even knock... but still, I've hidden in my room, or gone to a friend's house to avoid the door responsibility.

And still, my heart jumps into my throat when the doorbell rings.

This year, I've moved in with the friend-I-used-to-go-over-to's-house.. so there's noplace for me to go and hide.

He's bought candy. He's decorated our little apartment window. He's essentially hung out a sign saying 'free candy, just knock'.

And he won't be home til nearly 8pm.

Now, it's true.. we're in an apartment complex.. but there ARE kids living here. with only a 15-30% chance of rain.. there's bound to be a few brave souls at least knocking on the decorated doors.

And I'm home.. alone.

I'm 43 years old, and I'm DEEPLY afraid of some little kid in a plastic mask knocking on the door.

All I have to do is turn the knob, say ""oh my gosh, it's iron man!"" and hand them a couple pieces of candy, then wish them well on their crime fighting...

Yet I'm still scared.",14,2016-11-01 04:55:47 EDT-0400
609,Anxiety has destroyed my ability to remember anything,"Pardon the rant. You may recognize yourself here:

I've reached the point where I literally have no idea what's going on. I don't remember my past, my appointments, my plans. I've begun canceling everything and avoid people at all costs rather than deal with the three days of horrific anticipation before I so much as go out for a drink.

This situation led me to see doctors. Bood tests, cognitive tests, the works. The consensus? I have all the symptoms of dementia but not dementia. It's probably just stress! Oh, great. I've been seeing a therapist for that for years. Not much has changed.

It's terrifying. I can't function. And people are very quick with advice. ""You just need a system to remember things"" or ""put it in your phone"" or ""hey, don't worry, I'm the same way!"" They have no idea how bad it is.

The 'put it in your phone' is a classic example. If I put something in my phone I then spend days freaking out over anticipating the reminder. I'll forget about it for a few minutes and then panic and think ""oh shit what's the thing I'm supposed to do!"" My entire life becomes about not missing the fucking reminder.

It's now reached the point where I voluntarily walk the dogs, go to the store, and nothing else. We're theater buffs in a great city for it, and I was going to lots of plays and so on, going out with friends, etc. Now I'm canceling everything I can. My wife of course is out of patience. I keep telling her to go with somebody else. Anybody else.

Not looking for advice or anything. I know what needs to be done -- so far I haven't been medicated for it but that is going to change. Just wanted to rant a few minutes. Anybody else falling into the memory hole?

616,3 Things Not to Say to Someone Who’s Struggling with Anxiety ( My real story),"Some people are genetically predisposed to anxiety, some struggle because of stressful circumstances, and for some, physical conditions play a role.

But this isn’t a post about what causes anxiety. This is a post about what not to say when someone’s panicking.

Anxiety can completely overwhelm your mind and body, and we often exacerbate our pain by being cruel to ourselves in our head.

“Get it together!” we scream at ourselves. “What’s wrong with you? Why are you such a mess?”

But none of these thoughts are helpful. Though the people who love us are generally not as cruel, they sometimes say less than helpful things, as well, solely because they don’t know any better.

Even as someone who has experienced anxiety, I have said some of the things below to others because it feels powerless to see someone struggling. And when you feel powerless, it’s hard to think straight.

All you know is that you want to fix it for them. You want to have answers. But sometimes when we’re in fix-it mode, despite our best intentions, we inadvertently add fuel to the fire.

So, as someone who’s been on both sides of the coin, I’d like to share some phrases to avoid when someone is dealing with anxiety, and offer a little insight into what actually helps.

First

What you’re stressing about won’t even matter in a year.

In many cases, this is true. If someone’s worrying about a minor car accident, it’s entirely likely what they’re stressing about won’t really matter in the grand scheme of things. But this isn’t a universally true statement.

A minor accident could lead to major car trouble, which could lead to missing work, which could lead to lost pay, which could lead to getting evicted. And that could very well matter in a year. Is this chain of events likely? No, but it’s still possible.

It’s not reassuring to tell someone the worst-case scenario won’t happen because sometimes, it does. But more importantly, in that moment when someone is in the midst of anxiety, it feels catastrophic, and you can’t rationalize those feelings away—at least not immediately.

When someone is panicking, they don’t need logic; they need validation. They need validation that yes, life is uncertain and “bad” things do happen, and validation that it’s okay to feel scared

Second

Life’s too short to worry.

All this does is create more anxiety, because in addition to whatever that person was initially stressing about, they now have to worry that they’re missing out on life because of an emotional response that feels beyond their control.

Yes, life is short. And we all naturally want to make the most of it. But you wouldn’t tell a diabetic “Life is too short to have too much sugar in your blood.” Sure, you’d encourage them to make healthy food choices, but you’d realize this phrasing would vastly oversimplify the effort required from them to manage their condition and maintain healthy habits.

The same is true of anxiety. Anyone who’s struggled with it understands there are far better ways to live, and this knowledge pains them. What they may not know is how to help themselves.

Third

“Calm down” is the goal, not the action step. It’s what we all want to do when we’re panicking. It’s the shore in the distance, and it can feel miles away as we gasp for air in the undertow of emotion and struggle to stay afloat.

If you know any good methods that help you calm yourself—deep breathing exercises, for example—by all means, share them. But it’s probably best not to get into much detail in the moment when someone is panicking.

Imagine someone hanging off a cliff, about to fall into a pit full of tigers. That’s what anxiety can feel like.

If you were to stand at the edge and scream, “COME TO YOGA WITH ME TOMORROW! DID YOU KNOW THAT YOGA CAN HELP YOU…” that person would likely be too consumed by their terror to hear you your convincing argument.

What they need to hear in that moment is “Take my hand!” And the same is true of anxiety. Hold their hand. Help them breathe. Help them come back into the moment. Then, when they feel safe, that’s a good time to tell them what’s helped you.

That’s another important thing to remember: We all want to hear what’s helped other people deal, not what someone who’s never experienced our struggles has read about. Share your experience, not your expertise. None of us need a guru; we need friends who aren’t afraid to be vulnerable.

----------------

Not sure if this is the right place, but I tried searching for the correct sub and I felt you guys would probably be able to answer.

I have been seeing a therapist for about a month for anxiety/suicidal ideation.  I live relatively far away, and my commute is about 1 hr by subway.  Subway frequently gets delayed and they only come every 15 minutes.  The first two appointments went fine, though I was 5 min late for the second.  The third I had to cancel because of my job (co-worker called in sick the day of so I had to cancel my appointment). I left ample, but &amp;amp;lt;24h, notice, and offered to pay for the missed session.

Fast forward to today. I was again 5 min late. Instead of saying hello, the dude just started chewing me out for being 'disrespectful.'  He admitted he was 'getting heated' and I apologized profusely.  At some point he said, ""Do you even want to get better? What's the point if you don't even respect me enough to come on time?""  I apologized again, and he said ""Sounds like youre just paying me lip service.""  I said I didn't know what to say, and he repeated again about disrespect. I was calm the entire time, but he was certainly not.  I felt like my mother was yelling at me for not cleaning my room.

At some point, I just said, ""This isn't working. How much do I owe?"" He gave me the bill, and again said, *very* snarkily, ""I would be remiss if I didn't say that you are not going to succeed unless you commit, but I do not think you want to.""  I replied, ""You'll get your check"" and left.

I mean, wtf? Am I crazy or is that wholly unprofessional? I will admit that I could have tried to be 15 mins early but I didn't know I would be yelled at.

tl;dr Therapist yelled at me for being late. Is that appropriate?",81,2016-03-04 20:03:50 EST-0500
628,Bye guys.,"I realized today after browsing this sub that in the past year I've come a LONG ways from where I'd been for most of my life.

I've figured out through therapy what the main issue is - a diagnosis of PTSD - and another side issue unrelated to the main diagnosis - gender dysphoria.

I weened myself off of a five year addiction to klonopin, got switched to Xanax which I now only take before a particularly stressful day/event or when I feel a panic attack arising, and was approved for HRT (hormone replacement therapy) last July with the help of my therapist and a really great, new doctor. 

For the first time in my entire life, I finally like myself, and I'm unafraid to leave the house or socialize or go to job interviews, etc. I no longer hate the way I look and think that everyone hates me or thinks I'm ugly or annoying or whatever worry would pop into my head on a regular basis. I like my life, and myself, and I've really grown and changed for the better. Of course I do still have anxious moments, and I will probably be in therapy for a long time to help with my PTSD and my phobia of death, but overall, I've realized that I'm finally in a good, healthy place mentally. My anxiety is no longer consuming me and is not the focus of my life. 

So, I'm going to unsub. I thought about staying, but I feel like if I did I would be living in or remembering my past a bit vicariously through some of these posts. Kinda like, you know how if you think about a panic attack and all the symptoms of it, you might end up actually making yourself have one? It's sort of like that. I just want to let go of that part of me in a way and keep moving forward. I used to come here and read posts mostly for the advice/help and to feel less alone in my worries and fears. Now, hopefully one day, I hope to come back here after I finish school to become a therapist and feel a bit more qualified to offer legitimate help in return to you guys.

It can get better. Don't give up. I wish you all the best.

Edit: thank all of you guys for the replies! I can't wait for you all to be able to post a success story as well! You can make it through this! Take it one day at a time. <3 ",19,2016-03-04 05:00:56 EST-0500

This is a problem though.

Every job posting I see requires things of me that I can't imagine being/doing. Every template for how to write resumes and cover letters basically tells me the same thing: to sell myself, to detail my strengths, to self-advocate. But I can't. Not only because I really don't like lying but because the more I try to sell myself, the more I pretend that I'm a functional person who can handle his shit, the more likely it is that if someone were to hire me and give me some responsibility the more likely I will be to fuck it up. I have had jobs in the past (working for my parents so no application process was needed) where this exact thing happened: too much stress, too much responsibility and I damn near have panic attacks as a result.

I feel like I need to be honest about how little I value myself and how little I feel like I'm capable of and yet obviously that's a sure way to get nobody to hire me.

Anyone have any advice? ",25,2016-03-06 16:06:05 EST-0500
633,Fucking Done.,"I don't care who sees this or if this gets buried. I've just, I'm done with this anxiety bullshit. I'm done caring *why* I'm anxious or have been in the past. I'm done caring about the ways it manifests itself and infects my life and relationships. I'm done stressing about anxiety. I'm going to be nice to myself so I realize I don't need to fucking worry. I'm done being hard on myself for not tackling anxiety fast enough. I'm done being easy on myself for the days I let it kick my ass. 

No. You know what? For me, this is a thing that's just bubbled over the surface recently. I can knock it back down and stomp it back out. I'll do everything in my goddamn power to fucking stop this bullshit. Analyzing does nothing except sit more and more on that spot. Fuck it. Fuuuuck it. 

I have my therapist. I have techniques. What's more, I have fucking determination. I'm not letting this stupid shitty mind-game on myself defeat me or interfere with my life anymore. I'll do whatever it takes to stomp it the fuck out for good. Don't fucking care how, it's going to be done. I used to be confident and secure, I can be again. I will be again.

Today is one of those days where I'm visiting the toilet often but barely anything comes out. It's not a UTI and I'm TERRIFIED that it's diabetes. BUT i don't have any other symptoms of diabetes, i still feel like i have it though. It would make me feel better to hear if more people have the same problem as i do.

I just got finished with a temp job and I now don't do anything with my day except go to the gym and go to AA meetings twice a week. I have horrible social anxiety and have had a hard time meeting people. 

I feel like everyone around me is making fun of me or hates me. I have no social skills. Back when I was drinking I had a lot of friends but I destroyed those friendships. I destroyed a couple of them and have talked very little to people whose friendships I didn't destroy so they probably all hate me because they probably heard from other people how much of a weird piece of shit I was. The first time I got sober I made some friends but did a terrible job of keeping up with them and now live in a different city. I'm just so god damn alone and I know it's my fault because I'm a fucking loser with no social skills.

641,I would really like some advice on interacting with friends through my anxiety...,"So, I have a few old online friends, friends from college, and a much larger friend group that I met through my boyfriend of 3 years. I don't have any problems talking to my college friends, since they are primarily the ones that initiate conversation, and chatting online is easy, because I have time to think about what to say, but it's much harder to *continue* conversations in person with the friends I've made through my boyfriend. 

I've mastered small talk, i.e. ""How have you been?"" ""Whatcha been up to?"" ""I hate the weather right now, don't you?"", and I chime in on jokes that were said by others - and that seems to work fine -  but I know that only goes so far, and I feel like a ""one trick pony."" 

I've tried thinking of things to talk about before I'm going to interact with them, but I either forget about what I'm going to say, or it doesn't sound at all interesting once I've said it. The disinterest shows in their tone or on their faces and I just feel really stupid afterwards. Any time this happens, I think back to an event that I attended in high school. I was talking about something and the person that I was talking to screamed ""NO ONE CARES"" and everyone around started to laugh at me. Yes, this actually happened. (Going into the worst 4 years of my life is another slippery slope for another day.)

I've talked to my boyfriend about it several times and he's been very sympathetic about it until recently, which is understandable. He continues to reassure me that when I'm not around, his friends say nothing but good things about me, so I shouldn't worry, but that doesn't stop the super-anxious feelings in that moment. I've know this group for over 2 years and I'm still having issues? I'm annoyed at myself to the point of tears.

I know that most of my worries are in my head, but telling myself that doesn't make those feelings go away. I have coping techniques, but they only work after the encounter is over and everyone has gone home. 

Yes, I sought out professional help; I talked to a therapist, but she focused on other issues that she felt were more important. I’ve also talked with a psychologist and have been diagnosed. 
Unfortunately, there are no anxiety support groups where I live.

**TLDR:** I get very anxious when interacting with people. My mind just goes blank. I hate feeling like no one likes me because I never say anything worth talking about. I would really like some suggestions on where to even start to fix this or get over it.

642,I left my job!,"About 3 years ago, I had an awful, verbally abusive boss.  I thought that I could just strong-arm through it, deal with it for a couple years, and then move on.  Unfortunately, it got to the point where the combination of my anxiety, lack of treatment (medication, therapy), combined with depression led me to be committed to a hospital because of suicidal ideations.  

Fast forward through a lot, I was transferred to another unit, am on a good medication regimen, have gone through therapy, and have an excellent primary care physician.  I am in a really good place.  

However, the people in charge decided that they would bring the person who seriously emotionally and verbally abused me to work in the same office, saying ""trust us, we'll make her be nice.""

Instead of having a full on meltdown, I was able to be really honest with myself.  While I have improved a lot in the behavioral health department, I know that I am not to the point where I can handle even one cutting phrase from her.  

I am disappointed in myself that I still allow this individual to affect me in this way, but I talked it over with my husband, and we are in a great place financially so it's not a huge deal.  

Still, I am worried.  I feel like I should be more panicked (thank goodness for medication and therapy or I'd be in a worse spot).  Honestly, I'm proud of myself for making this decision and standing up for myself, but at the same time I feel like there's this huge unknown and I worry that I'm making this decision way too quickly.

I appreciate everyone here and the open forum.  I think I feel better just by telling my story.  Any advice is appreciated, but just typing this out is cathartic.  ",7,2016-03-02 22:00:21 EST-0500
643,People with anxiety are the kindest,"I don t know how many of you would find thrmselves in my place but anxiety made me a better person.


I am more emotional, I tend to care for everyone around me. I understand their problems and I try my best to be resonable with everyone. I like to greet everybody, I like to make strong bonds with people, listening to their problems and support them. 


All in all, everything comes with a gift. Every fear I faced made me the person I am today. I know how you feel. I know that sometimes you just want to stay in your corner and cry and let go of all your feelings. I want to be there for you, holding your hand and telling you to keep your head up. I love people. All of them, especially those ones who expose their real feelings towarda their problems. 


You are not your brain slave. Your brain is your mechanism, you control it. If you feel like you want to cry, cry. If you are stressed, scream! Scream as loud as you can. Let go of the negative energy that you hold within yourself! You are your own limit. If you want to take the step. Do it. Be a better person. Help everyone, forgive everyone that dissapointed you. You might aswell want to be forgived. Be the change you want to see in everyone else around you.


Last.. you always wanted to be succesful but you feel like you are cursed with this anxiety? I am still in your place but hell, I promise! I promise that I will fight my way out, I can t live like this anymore and just like you, I will get rid of this, forever. Yes.. I believe in you.. I believe in myself.. Everyday is a new small step and thank you, nature, for allowing me to live another day. Forget yesterday. Forget tomorrow. Today is the day that I will change my habits. Today is the day that I will make my small steps to a better life. 


You were never alone from the beginning!
We are all connected..find what you love to do and attach yourself to it. We are blessed by nature with this amazing imagination and while it can be our worst enemy, why don t we make a pact with it? Why don t we forgive ourselves? Why do we blame ourselves  so much? 


We got this far! We keep breathing. I am so damn grateful for this air that comes through my lungs! For every breath! Keep trying. You fail, try again. Keep this winning attitude in your life. 


I promise you, believe me.. Everything gets way better!

Thank you..all of you..

644,The thought of getting disciplined makes me anxious and depressed.,"I have been reading a lot on r/GetDisciplined, and while I want to and have been following much of the advice, I feel anxiety sometimes reading that stuff and thinking about my life being that way. I just can't imagine going to bed at 9pm and getting up at 5am. 

Night time is my happiest time, and TV/Reddit at night makes me very happy when I'm anxious all day. It's not like I'm doing this stuff all day. Really, just for about 2 hours at night. I have even cut back on video games, and lately have only played 30 minutes to an hour every day with my sister. I can handle this much. But the thought of less makes me depressed.

I have a big fear of losing time. I want to always have at least a little time for 5 main things; girlfriend (long distance), sister, video games, TV, and a little internet time. I'm just afraid I'll lose time with these things. I understand being disciplined might help my mood, but what good is it if I have no hobbies to rely on after a hard day?

647,"My anxiety, depression, and worrying is so bad. I'm in constant fear. I'm losing hope. Please help me or at least listen.","I never really rant or let out my whole story etc, and it'd just be really nice to have someone relate or be able to help or just read it.

I've always been shy and anxious. Although i never knew what anxiety was until I was about 17 or 18. (I'm going to be 19 this month). My anxiety became pretty horrible around 8th grade. I always just thought to myself ""why do i have to be so SHY?"" i never even knew anxiety existed.

Fast forward to October 2015. Early October, or the middle of Oct. I don't remember. Anyway, I'm in a ""relationship"" with this asshole who was manipulative, mean, didn't really give a shit about me except for my mouth and vagina, and was embarrassed of me because i didn't smoke weed and wasn't popular. I was just really at a bad time in my life, super anxious, really bad social anxiety (developed around 14 years old but worsened around age 16) and i was so ignorant and just so dumb, i stayed in the ""relationship"", but luckily it ended after just over a month. 

So, middle of October or so I keep being called a baby, lame, a loser, boring, stupid, not cool, and embarrassing because I didn't smoke weed. I have nothing against it, i just wasn't interested. Being the depressed and constantly worried person i am i thought ""well if i don't do it i'll look lame and like a loser."" 

the next day after work i come home, take pics and show him me smoking, and soon after begin feeling in a daze, so dizzy and lost i couldn't even figure out where i was. i was somewhat mentally ""there"" but was also going crazy. that wasn't what being high felt like, i just knew it. i have no clue where i am by this point, I think i'm dying, or lost in a dream, taken to another world, but still standing in the upstairs hallway i managed to run out to. i start screaming for my mom. SCREAMING. i just remember screaming and screaming, i thought i was dead. i thought no one could see me. i could see but i wasn't ""there"". it was an out of body experience. i never wanted to go through that again. screaming, randomly crying so hard, shaking, feeling insane, like i'm dying, my hands and feet tingling like crazy, nausea, chest pain, heart beating. the weed had to have been laced, right? my mom rushes me to the hospital. i continue screaming. i was so lost. was i dying? i had no clue. i go to the hospital. they do tests and just tell me it was a ""bad reaction"". 

i tell my ""BF"" the next day and he tells me to stop being such a baby, i did that to myself and i'm so stupid and weak. he was embarrassed and broke up with me over it.

i became depressed. after researching i concluded the built up YEARS of anxiety and worrying and fears were just on the verge of erupting and the weed triggered a panic attack. from october to late january i was in constant fear. constant fear. everyday. of another panic attack. it ended up happening again, and the DPDR or depersonalization (out of body feeling) still hasn't gone away from the last panic attack. it's mild but still makes me depressed and scared. i feel hopeless a lot.

i'm scared to sleep. i have constant fears. i can't see a therapist, psychiatrist, etc because my insurance doesn't cover them. i'm afraid of living in constant fear or going through a panic attack again. it's always a worry for me. I'm so depressed, anxious and sad some days i just can't stop crying. my panic attacks last hours. HOURS. the first one lasted 4-5 hours. the second lasting 3. everything i listed above from my weed PA is what goes on the whole time i have it. What ends them is i eventually fall asleep, but wake up so many times and freak out or somehow try to make sure i'm ""real"". ughhhhh, i just.. i don't know",13,2016-03-07 08:25:22 EST-0500

649,"I have anxiety, and want to change, but feel more anxiety about what it takes to change.","So I have pretty bad anxiety, and a lot of it is because of recent events in my life, making me sometimes feel like a failure and completely hopeless. Even if it's not that extreme, every day I feel like I'm forgetting something or missing something or doing something wrong. There are a lot of actual worries too, like job prospects, money, issues with my girlfriend of 5 years, and more.

I will be moving home with my parents in a few months, and possibly starting a new job about an hour commute away. This is a new stress in my life.

Anyways, I do realize I need discipline, and I badly want to change. I've been trying in the last few days. However, I'm terrified about the free time I'll lose every day. I think about the hour commute + 8 hours (if not more) work every day. So I'll have to get up very early if I want to do any disciplined activities like exercise and stuff. Then I'll get home late, and have little time before I have to sleep at 10-11pm. And it can only get worse if I decide to go back to school (night classes or online for second bachelors).

First of all, my night routine is the happiest time in my life almost. I love watching TV and messing with my phone before bed. If I have to give this up, I feel like I'll be even more unhappy. Then there's spending time with my family, especially my little sister who is somehow one of my best friends (she's only 11). I love video games, and also feel like I'm losing so much time for that, part of which is playing with my sister.

Finally, there's my girlfriend of 5 years. We've been very long distance for most of that, Skyping and texting, and only getting to see each other in person every 6 months. She's closer now, but still 3 hours away. I feel like with a full time job and ""disciplined activities"", I'll also lose Skype time with her. And maybe it will be harder to visit her every few weekends. And when she goes for her PhD in 1.5 years, then it'll really be hard with shitty vacation time with work. At least when we visited each other before, we had about a month together at a time.

I'm just rambling on now and I know this maybe belongs on another subreddit. Anyways, I'm just feeling so conflicted and just wanna give up. I'm not suicidal, but some nights I do feel like it would be easier to just not ever wake up. Will I ever be able to be happy with this lost time in my day? Can I get over losing my night routine and other stuff?

I just feel like I'm not capable of being an adult. It's like I'm choosing between being unhappy with my lack of disciplined life or unhappy with my lack of time. I don't know what to do or think anymore.",2,2016-03-05 10:31:20 EST-0500

Once my mom pressured me to play the piano in front of a bunch of friends. I refused but the pressure was unceasing and I started crying. ""Just play the piano and it'll be over!"" I ran and hid under a table in my friend's gazebo. Everybody ran and followed, then started pressuring me to come out. 

My mom threatened to take my books away if I didn't play the piano. When we got home she yelled, ""YOU'RE SO ANTISOCIAL IT'S SCARY! YOU'RE NEVER USING YOUR COMPUTER AGAIN!"" I got fucking grounded and had my computer taken away, like everything was 100% my fault. 

That is absolute hell, being surrounded by people pressuring you to do something that you have a phobia of doing.

A) Die 

B) Pass-out

I need to vent.  My social anxiety is really holding me back.

I became so angry I started swearing loudly (I only did this because I was alone at home) and started slamming my fists into the table.  I am so sad and angry over this.  I am a grown man and cant do the things that healthy men do.  I'm all alone in life and cant function properly.

However, I used street view to navigate my exact route so that I generally know what to expect to see on my travels. This has eased so many worries and what ifs.",6,2016-02-16 06:10:19 EST-0500
666,Feeling recovered and healed... finally!,"Hi all!  I have been feeling great as of late, better than I've ever felt in the past.  I'm finally feeling a healing feeling, rather than a coping feeling.  It's been weeks since I've had a panic attack. Although I have anxious moments, I'm able to recognize them and let them pass better than ever before.

I'd thought I'd share some tips.  I've tried to list them from most general to most specific.  Don't worry about cost - all of these tips include free resources.  Don't worry about your interest level - if any of these tips help you, that is great, and if not, it is ok, just leave them be :) 

*  Develop a diet plan.  Although it's easy to stress eat/drink when you feel anxious, you know that you'll always feel worse afterwards.  Once you start eating better, you'll recondition your mind and body - it will feel better, you will feel better, you will associate that positive feeling with this better food, and a negative feeling with bad food.  Eat a diet that is conducive to feeling calm and peaceful.  For me, that means avoiding high salt/sugar foods, fried foods, milk, coffee, and alcohol.  
* Develop an exercise plan.  Exercise is a huge release of endorphin, as well as an improvement of body image.  If you don't feel comfortable in a big gym, just try to get moving - walk outside down the street, in a park, or walk your dog.  Exercise at least 3 days a week, 30-60 minutes each day.
* See a therapist.  If your anxiety feels severe, see someone at least once a week.  If it's not so severe, see them at least every other week.  I recommend therapists over psychiatrists because therapists are there to focus on you and your cognitive therapy, while psychiatrists are there your medication and drug therapy.  (Please see a psychiatrist if you feel it is necessary though!)
* Remove yourself from the most stressful situation in your life.  For me, that meant quitting my job.  I've been working part time, and that's helped me float along while finding another job.  However, while I've been unemployed, I've been working on the following tips.
*  Work on building up your self-image.  It will re-program your inner thoughts from negative to positive, from fear and scarcity to love and abundance.  Listen to motivational tapes every day, while in the shower in the morning, while working, while exercising, or while driving.  It takes a few months and a few listens - repetition is key.  If you don't like a particular speaker or a particular message, it's ok to search for another one.  There's a lot of positive and motivational content out there.  [Les Brown](https://soundcloud.com/larry-amos-jr/day-8-les-brown-self-approval) is my favorite speaker.  [Joseph Clough](https://soundcloud.com/larry-amos-jr/sets/joseph-clough-nlp-coaching) is another good one.  This has been the LARGEST change for me.
*  Work on meditation.  This is difficult for people with anxiety, because our minds are always racing.  Meditation is a dedicated time to focus on thinking positively and introspectively.  Let your mind wander, and then focus on positive mantras as they come to you.  There is a lot of [meditation music](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nb3okem4OCk), as well as [guided meditation videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vx8iUvfyCY) - I find these help a lot.  While I've been unemployed, my mantras have been, ""You are a good person that will find the right job."" ""You will be successful at creating your own career."" ""Your credit score is irrelevant - you have everything you need credit for anyways.""
* Work on shaping your thoughts while interacting with others.  Those of us with anxiety, especially extreme social anxiety, are very very uncomfortable when speaking with others.  We might be thinking people are constantly judging us, or we might constantly judge others.  We might be thinking of what we will say next, to appease the other person, rather than really listening.  We might not really be listening at all, because we are so nervous while interacting with others.  Instead, I have been focusing on re-programming my thoughts about interacting with others.  The two biggest influences here have been [How to Win Friends and Influence People by Dale Carnegie](https://soundcloud.com/larry-amos-jr/sets/dale-carnegie-how-to-win), and [177 Mental Toughness Secrets of the World Class by Steve Siebold](https://soundcloud.com/larry-amos-jr/sets/177-mental-toughness-secrets).  It has helped me to make others feel important, avoid criticism in my speech, avoid ego-based thoughts, and connect much more genuinely with people.  I practice these tips every day, and get a little better each time.
* Create your own opportunities for your life, through your job, and your thinking.  Build your dream, and make it a reality.  Name the thing that you've always wanted to do, and do just a little bit of it.  Then build it, grow it, nurture it, and go after it.  It is your dream, you deserve it!  [Les Brown](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlUMrzwmbyo) is a great resource for motivation, and [Jim Rohn](https://soundcloud.com/larry-amos-jr/sets/jim-rohn-how-to-build-a) and [Tim Ferriss Four Hour Workweek](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hiNWwPAfV4) are great resources for business thinking.  You don't have to start a business, but there is likely an idea that you've had that you haven't done yet because you didn't believe you could, so you've been holding yourself back.  It is really powerful once you face your fears and do it anyways.  For me, that meant starting my business, and leaving my full-time job.  Since then, I've been able to work 10 hours a week, do home improvement projects, volunteer for a political campaign, and work on an app start-up.  I'm able to spend my time the way I want to.  I realize that's been my dream all along.

Hope any or all of these help.  Have a great day!",6,2016-02-17 11:29:59 EST-0500
667,OMG this is so frustrating. Anxiety can seem like 'failing at life,"I have lived thousands of miles and several timezones away from friends and family, in a totally different culture, where to understand the local language you need to learn three new alphabets, but now that I am back in my home country and considering moving away from the big city and my hometown (to somewhere quieter, to do something less stressful), I am finding it hard to overcome anxiety and actually make the move.

I have travelled alone for several months in far away places, taken risks like leaving a stable job to work as a tour guide, but since a traumatic experience at the end of my time overseas, I have been experiencing anxiety.

I have never experienced this kind of generalised anxiety before. Previously I would have embarked on this kind of move knowing that there were risks but also that it was worth the effort.

I came back with some savings and wanted to give myself a break since my time abroad was a bit intense and my job when I came back was not at all interesting. I have already left the job but now each day that I don't do anything it's very frustrating and hard not to become negative and feel stuck (trapped).

I'm sure I'm not the only one who has experienced this and I am sure there is a different way of looking at it. I am looking for examples of how you may have overcome this kind of situation.

Thanks for reading and I value your comments, thoughts or advice.

TL/DR: Moved back home after three years living abroad, want to move away to a quieter, more relaxing place and do a less stressful job but finding it hard to overcome anxiety.",9,2016-02-20 23:33:01 EST-0500

674,Passed my final driving license test!,"I know a lot of people in /r/anxiety struggle with driving and/or driving tests so I just wanted to share my recent victory. In my province there are 3 levels of license (G1, G2, G), the last two of which require a driving test. I only really started driving when I was 24, and have had A LOT of anxiety about driving. Fear of not being good enough, getting distracted, ruining someone's car, etc. I failed my G2 test twice in large part because of my anxiety (of both driving AND being tested/observed). So when I realized my G2 license was going to expire in March I started panicking...Despite having driven halfway across Canada with a friend, driving on the big highways regularly alone, etc. I was so nervous that I would fuck up something basic and fail the test. 

But I passed! On the first attempt! I practiced with a few people in the weeks coming up to the test, really focused on my weakest driving areas (parking, ugh) and only told 3 people I was even taking the test. That was huge in reducing the anxiety I felt when thinking about having to tell everyone if I failed. In the hours before the test I kept reminding myself ""either way you'll be done in X number of hours"" and that lots of people fail their first try. Add in a beta blocker and I passed. 

Hope this helps some of you :)

679,Does anyone else get 'Saying No' Anxiety?,"Saying 'no' to people really sends me into almost paralyzing anxiety. 

For example, if someone is expecting you to train for a new job, but gut instinct is going crazy with panic every time a thought remotely relating to it comes up. This happened to me just the other day, and I realized it's going to be much better for me if I just stop and don't go through with it (at least at the moment). But the fact that I have to let the people know that I can't do it right now is putting me on the verge of a panic attack almost constantly. I've already told them, but I'm waiting for an answer, and have training come up soon.. It's making me crazy and I don't know what to do with myself. 

Does anybody else feel this way when you feel like you're letting someone down, or changing your plan? 

Thinking about it more abstractly, it seems ridiculous, because I'm doing what's best for me, and ultimately what's best for them because I can't be at peak performance.

However, my mental health is making class difficult. I can't take advantage of the opportunities that are offered to me, my GPA is dropping, and I'm slacking off at work. Also, the meds I'm on are doing an okay job at making me feel better, but they're also making me stupid. Like, I can't think nearly as well as I use to. 

I'm worried that this is going to mess up my job prospects, my ability to get into grad school, and basically my entire goddamn life. 

I could do so much fucking better. I could be so much more, if it weren't for the fact that I have to fight myself every goddamn step of the way.

686,I had my first panic attack in front of my high school students yesterday,"This is my fourth year teaching, and my anxiety has been under control enough that my panic attacks have been blessedly few and far between. I had a med switch recently, though, and I don't think my body is handling it well. 

If I *had* to have a panic attack in class, this was probably the best way it could have happened. My students were in writing groups scattered throughout the seats in our auditorium (I'm a music and theatre teacher), and it started in the last 5 or so minutes before the lunch bell. I felt it starting and quietly went to a seat and hugged my knees until I had to spit out instructions to pack up. As soon as the bell rang and they cleared out I ran backstage and curled up in a ball on the floor until I calmed down. A few students asked if I was cold, but other than that, no one noticed. 

I got very lucky. We could have been in my classroom. I could have been teaching a lesson. I could have been rehearsing with my chorus.

I'm been doing okay so far today, and I'm crossing my fingers that there isn't a repeat occurrence. We'll see what my psychiatrist has to say about this next week. ",8,2016-12-09 17:56:15 EST-0500

694,Friend with anxiety and depression is EXTREMELY difficult to be friends with,"Hi, I just want to start out by saying that my friend is a really awesome person deep deep down but I need advice on how to continue being her friend.

She has severe anxiety and depression. Her anxiety attacks stem from smelling any hint of marijuana. I really try and help to calm her down when she smells it, but she normally wants to be alone so I respect that. We live in a college town so it's difficult to avoid. 

That's not even the real issue for me though. The issue is that she is so mean to people and just annoying at some points. When we are out she talks loudly about her sex life, sneers at people if they bump into her, gets angry when she doesn't get her way, complains all the time about how she's fat while continuing to chug beers, complains about anyone and everyone (most of her talking points) and interrupts me while I'm talking CONSTANTLY. I don't know if it's the extremely low self esteem she has, or the anxiety and depression or maybe she's just a shitty person all together, but I feel like I can't be friends with her if she continues to act like this.

I don't want to abandon her because of something she can't control but it's almost embarrassing for me to go out in public with her, anything I can do to help her without sounding like the biggest bitch in the world?

1.  The flow of the conversation is such that I can't break in without interrupting and being rude, or
2.  I get one-two words out before someone starts talking over me.  

I had one time where someone made a reference to Pampered Chef and I didn't know what Pampered Chef was.  It was nearly 10 minutes before there was enough of a break in the conversation for me to ask the question, what is Pampered Chef?  

I also had a time where I was so frustrated that I threw a minor tantrum about not being able to get into the conversation.  

I understand the ""rules"" about conversations:  you are supposed to wait until the other person is finished talking before you say something.  But what do you do when someone jumps in before you can open your mouth or talks over you??

Her and I had never really talked before, apart from casual passing hi's and goodbye's/how's it goin'. However, tonight I walked into the kitchen after a couple of beers, and she was making dinner. I bravely queried about her night out with my mate last Friday night, and she responded positively and eagerly, sharing her experience. She then followed up by asking about my Uni life, which I - emboldened by the liquid courage - shared my progress, hopes, fears and doubts. She responded so encouragingly and genuinely interested, I felt so elated and confident. I offered to show her (and my friend) the recordings I'd performed/created (I study Audio Engineering) the past 6 months, and she was very supportive and curious.

714,What growing up with severe social anxiety feels like,"Wrote this last night. For some reason I was having mental breakthroughs and felt compelled to write them down. And post it in spite of the great anxiety doing so gives me (fear of negative evaluation and all that).

At some point you realize that it's more than just shyness. Intimacy provokes fear/anxiety, anxiety provokes avoidance. So you don't learn the right social skills because you don't put yourself in social situations. And as you get older, and you realize how important society and social interaction is, it just suddenly dawns on you just how stunted you are - people spent years and years honing these skills from elementary school to high school, while you spent those years hiding in fear, fortifying the iron bars of introversion you caged yourself in. You try to take the mask off, to break free of that prison, but you realize you spent so long hiding that you never learned how to act, how to be genuine and ""normal"" around others. The mask is more normal than you are. Like learning a language, the only way to ever be truly fluent is to learn it as a young child. I can gain competency, even working fluency in it, but I'll always be an outsider, an alien stepping into a foreign land and disguising himself as one of its people. My mother tongue will always be different from theirs. Social skills like playing games, sharing secrets, making friends, trust? They were born in it; molded by it. I didn't think about those things until I was already a man, and by then they were nothing to me but distant concepts, buried in the abyss of ancient defense mechanisms and anxious thoughts I call home.
 
And I've been here so long, hiding behind walls of defenses I never even knew existed, I can't even determine what's real, whats true and what's false. I don't trust my own mind anymore. Everything could just be another excuse, another instance where I procrastinate and fail to tackle the real issues. And it makes you feel insane, sometimes, you know? I'm like a victim of self-inflicted solitary confinement. We are social beings by default - we gauge our behavior and moderate our thoughts and beliefs based on those of others. I never had that. I never had the back-and-forth of friendly arguing, the ability to ""normalize"" my thoughts in accordance with others. I never wanted to play with other kids, never wanted to talk to anyone, I just sought the safety of my room after every school day. That portion of my brain that was supposed to be shaped by intimacy, trust, and friendship is instead shaped by fear and avoidance.

You focus on each thing individually, picking out as much detail as you can. In this way your mind is occupied until the attack passes. It's kind of a grounding thing.",5,2016-10-15 18:29:05 EDT-0400

I get separation anxiety when I am separated from a person who is a regular in my life, especially a significant other.  I believe I am far too dependent on the presence of others to keep my anxiety at bay.  I am now on Effexor for anxiety/depression and I take hydroxyzine whenever I feel a surge of anxiety.  I also enjoy recreational drugs occasionally to help with severe cases.  I have an extremely hard time finding soothing activities because when I'm anxious, I can't concentrate on anything and it seems impossible to bring myself down from that.

727,10 Ways that helped me ease my anxiety issues.,"I have a experienced a LOT of panic attacks in my life and unlimited amount of anxiety but this year life it's better because it does not trigger that much.

Before I go into the tips I just want to make something clear: No matter your situation and symptoms you can always improve and easy your anxiety. Here we go:

1. Quit Caffeine. ( this was a huge step)

2. Hang out with friends and do this a lot ( if you don't have any just go to the nearest coffee shop drink your lemonade and watch people passing by

3. Eat mostly clean but if you crave something just do it once or twice a week. 

4. Meditate at least 15 minutes a day ( especially when times are bad is when you need it. ) 

5. Go exercise. I can't stress this enough it has helped boosting my mood and my self - esteem a lot 

6. Sauna, Jacuzzi, Massage . Do those, sometimes the tension we feel is trapped inside of our bodies and we really need someone to get it out 

7. Force yourself to go outside the house everyday even walking 5 minutes.

8. Rest and do this a lot, don't find this as an excuse to proscastinate but really take a break you might be doing too much and some things people do efforless we put to much energy and struggle to do it and that burns as off. Just rest. Play your favorite video game, have a beer if you like, talk to someone just take a break. 

9. Talk to people: Just say hi and contunue your day, this will help you understand that people are not monsters and they won't bite you. 

10. Always remember that you are awesome and your life it's the most precious and important thing you have and at the end it's you vs you, bad times maybe here and you think now that they won't surpass but DO remember and believe that it will get better and it **WILL** you just have to help yourself.

EDIT: I hope this helps, take care guys please! 
EDIT 2: Oh oh oh and don't forget to be patient!! That's really really important.

728,"Dealing with anxiety for close to 40 years, here are 5 things that have really helped me.","**Eating clean**

This has had a huge impact on me. Eat eggs, salad, chicken, salmon, brown rice. Stop eating crap every day. You can still eat bad food, just eat less of it. Make bad food the exception, not the rule.

**Exercising**

Try to get some kind of exercise in at least once a day, it's incredibly helpful for your brain. I lost close to 100lbs and now I'm in great shape. Remember, you don't burn fat, you exhale it. Find an exercise that will elevate your heart rate and get you exhaling more.

**Resting**

Don't forget to get your rest, try to sleep 8 hours a day. I've found this is also incredibly important for my brain.

**Becoming more goal oriented**

Having something to work towards can often take your mind off the things that are worrying you.

**Less social media**

Spend less time on social media in general. Go outside and enjoy the world!

730,Sleep With Me podcast has been an amazing help with anxiety-induced insomnia,"When my anxiety rears it's head, the main result is sleeplessness, which then leads to worse anxiety, and on and on. I wake up in the night, realize I haven't gotten much sleep, then feel even worse, and just descend into a helpless, scared panic, unless I can head it off, usually with the help of drugs. 

The past few nights I've been listening to [Sleep With Me](http://www.sleepwithmepodcast.com/). It's a podcast wherein the host tells long, rambling stories designed specifically to captivate but not excite the listener. The idea is to keep your attention, distract you from yourself, and ease you into sleep. I woke up last night, starting out of sleep with a jolt, and normally that would have meant a restless night. But I had left the podcast playing, and it gave me something to focus on besides my fearful thoughts. I was back asleep within ten minutes.

The host has an inimitable quality of voice to catch your attention and hold it, but to let you drift along with him, filling his stories with boring details, side plots that go nowhere, embelishments that don't add anything, little asides that always seem about to reveal something profound but just sort of lilt back down like a falling leaf. It's not like white noise or beach sounds or whale song because there's an actual ""narrative"" that tricks you into paying attention. And all in a voice that's part Bob Ross and part bored DMV clerk; it's hard to describe, but the host - Dearest Scooter - has a tired, earnest voice that you *want* to listen to, but never *says* anything. There's no coherent plot, but you're never tempted to switch off, because the next moment maybe - *maybe* - it will lead somewhere. It's hypnotic and distracting and it puts me out like a light.

I know what it's like to be trapped away from sleep. I was skeptical of this podcast; it seemed too simple, too easy. If anyone else here has trouble sleeping, or you need something that will distract you from your thoughts without further exciting them, I cannot recommend this podcast high enough. It's free and there's hundreds (400+ and counting)* of episodes. You'll never run out. Please please *please* try this. It could help you. I hope so.

733,"Thank you, r/anxiety! You gave me the confidence to go to a concert alone in a huge city, and it was absolutely incredible.","The other day, I posted on here about how scared I was to go to a Demi Lovato concert I won tickets for in a sweepstakes. None of my friends could go, and I was extremely frightened by the prospect of going there by myself. I've never been to a big city before, and it took a lot of encouragement and positive self-talk before I finally convinced myself that it would be the right decision. 

I almost talked myself out of it when my parents offered to let me stay with them for the weekend as an alternative to ""being lonely"" up in Kansas City, as they put it.

After I posted about my dilemma to r/anxiety, the positive feedback I received was enough to make me reconsider the concert again, and I decided to drive up there yesterday.

Driving in the city was scary at first, but I managed to stay calm by listening very closely to the GPS and focusing on the road ahead. 

Once I got to the hotel, everything went off without a hitch. I checked into my room (first time I've done that by myself) and I got my stuff ready for the concert.

I managed to get a fantastic parking spot at the very front of the venue by going there 2 hours in advance, and I picked up my free tickets at the box office (to think that my parents had told me that the tickets I won were 'just a scam'!)

I bought a Demi t-shirt and I fucking rocked it! The majority of the audience members were girls, and some of them probably assumed I was gay, but honestly? I didn't care anymore! I made it all the way to this concert *by myself*. I never in a million years thought I could do that!

A wave of anxiety hit me right before the concert as a bunch of teenagers flowed in behind me. They were gossiping about celebrity drama, taking selfies, and Snapchatting which reminded me of the types of girls in my old high school who wouldn't give me the time of day. I got really quiet and anxious for about 20 minutes, worried that I wouldn't be able to enjoy the concert as much as I thought.

But when Demi hit the stage...*I freaked out*. In a good way! Everyone around me was screaming at the top of their lungs, and I joined in, relieved that any negative attention directed at me was dispelled by the sheer enthusiasm and noise. I even found myself dancing. Dancing! Knowing all the songs and most of the lyrics was an absolutely incredible feeling since I could easily got lost in the music, and, for the first time in a long time, I was actually enjoying myself in a sincere, anxiety-free way.

This experience was proof to me that I am capable of anything if I put my mind to it. My anxiety doesn't control me, and I can put it aside if I need to. And that's something I never thought I could ever say. Thank you so much for giving me that last essential push of encouragement, r/anxiety. You guys are the best.",9,2016-08-08 21:18:01 EDT-0400

738,Does anyone feel like they missed basic social blueprints growing up?,"Sometimes I feel like I'm misunderstanding something everyone else understands. I'll give you the main example that caused me to write this post:

Guy comforting/complimenting his girl friend.

Note: girl-*space*-friend, not significant other. I have a friend who we'll call A. This friend, in my eyes at least, is significantly better than me in just about department there is to being a man. Looks, charm, wit, intelligence. Sometimes it bothers me. Actually, it bothers me quite a bit.

Anyways, sometimes I see what A is doing and think, wait a minute, that seems wrong! A is putting his arm around our friend (all these ""friends"" are girls, to be clear) to comfort her when she feels sick or upset, and the first time I see him do this it feels deeply wrong to me. Why the touching? Is he unaware of her personal space? And why does she apparently not care?

Then, another day, A casually turns to our friend and compliments her for looking ""very nice today"". Wait, what? You can do that? I think I missed out on that one, too. 

Anyways, you see my point. I think that growing up while isolating myself from others caused two things to happen: 1) I missed out on some important things every normal person understands about society, and 2) I led myself to believe that everyone is as protective of themselves as I am.

I've had anxiety *forever*, and it's always been severe (I have panic disorder, multiple phobias, GAD, and serious health anxiety - I've also started to developed some obsessive tendencies). 

I've been this way since I was a child. I'm 24 now. I've seen psychiatrists, psychologists, and counsellors. They've helped in the past, but my life right now is just too much for me. During my last therapy session (about 3 months ago because I moved two hours away and still need to find a new one), we discovered my anxiety was causing mild-moderate depression. I spoke to my doctor about this, and she officially diagnosed me with severe anxiety and moderate depression. She has been urging me to take medication for years, but I've always refused because I have a phobia of allergic reactions.

I finally got the medication during my last visit, but I still haven't worked up the courage to take it. My husband really wants me to take it, and so does everyone else around me. I know I need to. My anxiety/depression is completely ruling my life right now. I almost dropped out of school AND quit my job (a job IN my field!) yesterday. My parents even offered to stay with me for a week while I took it to help ease the anxiety of something happening to me while my husband worked. 

I just...need encouragement. The last three months of my life have been hectic: I moved to a brand new city, at least an hour away from everyone I know, I started a REAL job, I am still finishing off university courses, my husband got into a serious car accident and our car was totalled, he started a new job...it's just been a lot all at once and I don't do well with change.

I know that was all over the place. I'm kind of having a panic attack right now, so, yeah.

**TL;DR:** A lot of things have changed in the last few months. I know I need to take medication to control my anxiety/depression, but I'm terrified. Help.

749,How I beat my panic attacks.,"Hi All,


I've had panic attacks on and off for years. Here's how I solved them. They're actually pretty simple to cure.  I hope this helps you. 


1.) First, understand that panic attacks are simply your stress system misfiring adrenaline. It's not a mental illness; it's a physical response designed to protect you. Panic attacks are NOT designed to hurt you and they are physically harmless. They are uncomfortable but not harmful. No one has ever died from a panic attack. When you're having a panic attack, keep telling yourself that it's uncomfortable but not harmful...uncomfortable but not harmful. 


2.) You have to stop fearing your panic attacks. I used to worry about them constantly and the worry would add stress and drastically lower my quality of life. I was afraid that I'd get one and freak out at work or at a social event. It was the worst. Worrying about an uncomfortable but harmless panic attack made it much worse. 


3.) When a panic attack hits, sit still and let the adrenaline rush wash over you. Know that it will be gone in a few minutes. Know that you've survived panic attacks in the future and you will survive it again in the present. Don't try to fight it; it will only make it worse. Tell your panic attack to ""bring it on"" and it will go away. 


4.) Face your fears. If you're terrified of going to a mall because you'll have a panic attack, then go to the mall and try to have a panic attack. The odds are that you won't have a panic attack at all.

750,What it's like to have high functioning anxiety,,94,2016-10-07 01:30:18 EDT-0400
751,Kid Cudi checks himself into rehab,"Came across news this morning that Hip Hop celebrity Kid Cudi checks himself into rehab for depression and suicidal thoughts. He wrote this letter to his fans where anxiety is mentioned.
Just wanted to say that none of us are alone in our fight with anxiety.

Here is the letter: 

""Its been difficult for me to find the words to what Im about to share with you because I feel ashamed. Ashamed to be a leader and hero to so many while admitting I’ve been living a lie. It took me a while to get to this place of commitment, but it is something I have to do for myself, my family, my best friend/daughter and all of you, my fans.
Yesterday I checked myself into rehab for depression and suicidal urges.

I am not at peace. I haven’t been since you’ve known me. If I didn’t come here, I wouldve done something to myself. I simply am a damaged human swimming in a pool of emotions everyday of my life. Theres a ragin violent storm inside of my heart at all times. Idk what peace feels like. Idk how to relax. My anxiety and depression have ruled my life for as long as I can remember and I never leave the house because of it. I cant make new friends because of it. I dont trust anyone because of it and Im tired of being held back in my life. I deserve to have peace. I deserve to be happy and smiling. Why not me? I guess I give so much of myself to others I forgot that I need to show myself some love too. I think I never really knew how. Im scared, im sad, I feel like I let a lot of people down and again, Im sorry. Its time I fix me. Im nervous but ima get through this.

I wont be around to promote much, but the good folks at Republic and my manager Dennis will inform you about upcoming releases. The music videos, album release date etc. The album is still on the way. Promise. I wanted to square away all the business before I got here so I could focus on my recovery.

If all goes well ill be out in time for Complexcon and ill be lookin forward to seeing you all there for high fives and hugs.

Love and light to everyone who has love for me and I am sorry if I let anyone down. I really am sorry. Ill be back, stronger, better. Reborn. I feel like shit, I feel so ashamed. Im sorry.

I love you,

I've been anxious lately.. I always have been and a lot has been going on at home. So when they started asking me questions I just blanked out and started crying.   
  
They were two really nice girls and offered to reschedule for some other time. I declined their offer and told them I would just leave.  
  
I haven't had the urge to die like this in a very long time.  
  
I am more angry at myself than anything. ",31,2016-10-01 04:09:10 EDT-0400

756,Can't Get a job due to my anxiety,"I am 18 years old, and I have been dealing with anxiety and depression for about 4 years. It has come to the point that I can't get a job because of it. 

Just the thought of getting a job makes me sick, to the point that I want to throw up. I am so scared of missing out of the things at home, messing up at work, going for job interviews, making phone calls. I cannot be a functioning member of society. I wish I knew why I was like this, but I don't understand it myself.

My family and my boyfriend harass me about it nonstop. Asking multiple times a day if I got a job, to just suck it up, that ""nobody wants to work"". It has done nothing but hate myself more than I already do. I go to sleep stressing about a job, its the first thing I think of when I wake up, it's always the main conversation. My boyfriend is constantly upset with me because I don't have a job. I'm upset with myself.

I live within my means. I don't go and do anything super expensive, I make sure I have money from babysitting gigs, etc. I don't expect anyone to pay for me for anything.

Does anyone have advice? I am really at a loss and have been spiraling downhill. Thank you in advanced..

757,I will never graduate (the cycle continues),"I'm diagnosed with Depression and Anxiety, and Generalized Anxiety (anxiety about everything basically).
I've been smart and have never had to try that hard in school. I would not do homework and cram the night before exams and pass. 

I'm in college now. I feel more enabled to miss class because teachers don't really care who shows up. So I miss class. 
Then I'm anxious about the material I missed, but I'm too anxious to contact the teacher because I think they don't like me because I missed class. 
So I distract myself and drown in Netflix until 4 am and sleep through all my classes, and when I am up for them I don't go because I'm anxious I will be put down by the teacher.

AND THUS The Cycle Continues... :(

any advice?

759,My Boyfriend is crippled By his Anxiety and I don't know what to do,"Let me know if this is the wrong place to post this. I'm really confused about what to do and I'm looking for some insight into anxiety to hopefully help me with the situation 

My boyfriend at I have been dating for 10 months and he's had some pretty severe anxiety over this time. It's usually related to a very understandable source of stress (i.e. a big exam, his job messing up his pay etc.). He get's terrified and becomes a non functional person (doesn't eat, doesn't shower, sleeps a weird times). When he get's anxious he ""hides"" and won't answer his phone. He'll spend all day in bed or playing video games. However, this also means he flakes on plans to talk on the phone or skype (we're in an LDR while I'm at grad school). He used to do it when he was in school but now I'm worried it's going to cost him his job (he hasn't skipped work or anything but I fear it could happen). 

Earlier in the year I encouraged him to seek help and find a therapist which he did and things got a bit better. He's backsliding now. He doesn't have a lot of money and can only afford to go once a month. I've told him to ask about sliding scales but he hasn't. 

Earlier today he flaked on some plans to hide so I sent him this text: 

""I find it frustrating when you fake on plans because you’re hiding. You said you wanted to Skype tonight when I proposed it and I was really looking forward to seeing you. I understand that this situation is beyond stressful but you’re letting it control your life like [the last big scary thing] did. This isn’t a sustainable way of managing your anxiety and I’m really worried about you."" 

When I try to tell him how I feel about the situation it just ends up with me comforting him because he gets anxious about being a bad boyfriend. I have anxiety problems myself which I treat with medication and therapy so I understand where he's coming from but I'm getting worn out. I really love him and there's a thousand amazing things about him which make me want to be in a relationship with him. But I can't do this anymore. I'm emotionally exhausted. This situation triggers my own anxiety and I don't know what to do. ",27,2016-10-04 06:02:57 EDT-0400

764,"Propranolol got rid of my physical anxiety, and for the first time in years I feel like myself. My ""idgaf"" self. I still worry, but that's okay, I can deal with that.","My anxiety was so embarassing to me. I'd shake, I'd find it hard to breath, my self esteem was non existent. I was always scared of looking strange.

I literally remember going from my school to college at 16 and suddenly finding myself in this situation where I felt inferior to other people. I was stressed, I couldn't deal with put downs from my friend who had her own self esteem issues.

My whole personality started changing, and it only got worse.

Until I started on Propranolol not even two months ago.

It stops the physical effects of anxiety, and although I did at first, now I don't worry about having a panic attack. It's not so much not panicking that has helped me, it's more that I can do things without the fear of the humiliation of having a panic attack or the way anxiety would show.

Within two months I have started to feel confident again and I don't really mind about what other's think.

One example of how far I have come...

Yesterday I got on the train and there I saw a person who hates me. We used to be very very close friends, and then in my opinion she betrayed me and she went all out hateful. It was unpleasant for all involved.

So anyway, I saw this person on the train, and they saw me as I got on. They glared at me and looked away quickly. I had to walk past to find a seat, and we made eye contact. Usually I'd find something like this awkward, I'd be very uncomfortable, my heart would be racing, I'd feel crap about myself because I'm reminded someone out there doesn't like me and went out of their way to be mean to me and people I thought we both cared about for standing by me (not even taking sides, just not wanting me to be treated like crap).

*Yesterday I smiled and said hello to this person.*

I phoned my partner up on my way home to tell him and we laughed - a lot. I'm still socially awkward, but at least I don't give a fuck about it anymore. I held my head high and continued to walk past and find a seat. She turned from a glaring look on her face, to one of instant grumpiness and looked away. I was still having a fairly good day.

I still worry about things and sometimes I avoid stuff for fear that it will send me into a panic or an emotional fit of tears that I can't do things... But I've made so much progress that everyone can see it.",30,2016-10-07 17:59:31 EDT-0400
765,Does anyone else feel irrationally Guilty all the time?,"I feel guilty after almost every conversation I have with a stranger. I always feel like I messed something up, may have offended them somehow, came off as weird, etc.

Examples just from today: The cashier seemed super annoyed because she had to point to the tiny ""swipe only"" sign when I tried to shove my card into the chip reader.  I felt so stupid that I actually sat in my car and cried after.

 I called to make a therapist appt. late at night- expecting to leave a vm, and she picked up and said she was mid-session and I again felt really dumb and cried.

The crying is new, thus the therapy appt. Every tiny inconvenience feels like a last straw situation lately.
However  I have always struggled with feeling guilty ALL THE TIME. Over EVERYTHING. 

If I'm talking to someone I'm close to I feel defensive, like I have to prove I'm not stupid, and am very sensitive to any kind of rejection or criticism- even if it's a joke I have to hide that I feel hurt because I know it's not meant poorly. I think this is linked to fear of feeling ashamed, which is in the same vein as guilt.

Has anyone else struggled with similar issues to this and overcome them? Can anyone offer advice to, I don't know, not feel guilty over nothing? Or can you relate at least?

I know that the rational response to both of the situations  I mentioned is literally just forgetting about it because its no big deal. I don't know why I'm a big wet towel about it.

770,I Can't Even Text My Friends,"I start texting so many times and just erase it. I feel like I annoy all of my friends. I don't know what to talk about anymore. I don't know how to have a conversation. I haven't talked to any of my IRL friends in weeks and the only place I've been talking to my online/long distance friends was we would play DnD over Skype once a week but we can't do that anymore because of scheduling. I kinda want to delete this post. I'm freaked out every time I go to say something and somehow it's even worse when texting. I used to at least be able to do that. I have one friend who actually tries to talk to me and I'm even scared shitless to talk to her because I don't want to lose the only friend I still have. I hate anxiety.

772,Thinking about quitting my new job because anxiety and frequent panic attacks,"I'm a programmer who just started working at a tech startup. I've also been working with a therapist to help manage my panic disorder for a few years. 

This job is not at all what I expected. I was told that it had a pretty good work-life balance, but for the last 2 months we've been expected to get in at 9 and work until much later than 9 in the evening. Lots of people are sleeping in the office because they have to stay in so late, and when people start leaving for the night, the CEO sends out emails about how if we worked smarter we wouldn't have to work so late, and that he expects to see everyone giving 110% first thing in the morning. 

Because of the hours I haven't been able to see my family or girlfriend very much since I started. I've also been dealing with some insurance issues (on my therapist's side, our company HR has done everything right) and that's made things worse. I've been having panic attacks most days in the office and today I had one at the thought of going back in to deal with this stuff again tomorrow. 

I know that something needs to change here but I don't have any faith that it will. From what I've heard, the CEO won't approve any new hires because he sincerely thinks that we can get everything done in a 9-5 work week. 

I don't really know what to do. I'm not sure if I'm mishandling things because I haven't seen my therapist in a while and I don't know how to bring this up with my boss. I've heard from him that people are wondering why I got to leave early for my therapy appointments (when I had them) and they seem unwilling to discuss accommodations.

774,I passed my driving test!,"I've been lurking around these parts for a while now, and just wanted to share a bit of good news!

I passed my driving test today, after a year of lessons. I took many more hours of lessons and outside practice than most people do. But I did it, first time!

Here are the things that got me through it, in the hopes that maybe they can help someone here. Maybe you can apply some of them to other kinds of exams too. 

- Try and get a bit of sleep beforehand, even if it's just a few naps. My mind was racing last night, and I had to do some deep breathing and visualisations (I visualised successfully doing the difficult manoeuvres). If you can't sleep, at least stay rested: lie down, read a book, do calm things that don't deplete your energy. 

-Don't tell too many people about your test. I told my immediate family only so I wouldn't wake up to an inbox full of good luck messages. Also, if I did fail, I'd only have to tell a couple of people rather than broadcasting it to the world. 

- Get up in the morning with plenty of time to spare. I managed to get on a bit of makeup; looking good = feeling good (for me at least)

- Banana for breakfast! Your stomach will probably tell you otherwise, but you gotta get that potassium and tryptophan! (Potassium helps with the shakes, tryptophan makes ya feel happy :D)

- No caffeine (oops). I am weak and couldn't resist a cup of the freshly brewed coffee my brother made, but seriously, it doesn't help with your nerves. 

- Deep breathing again. I had a short drive around with my instructor first, then we went to the test centre. I sat in a waiting room for a few minutes and took the time to get my breathing under control. Out breaths longer than in breaths, breath with your diaphragm, the usual. 

- Be prepared for some surprises! I was randomly selected to have an invigilator sit with me to check the examiner was doing his job properly, so I ended up with a full house. I opted to have my instructor in the car with me so I had a friendly face, and if I did fail he would know exactly where I went wrong. (I'm in the UK, where you can have your instructor with you. You may not be able to in other places though.)

- Did I mention deep breathing? I had a few panics during the test in which I found myself not breathing at all. I must have looked like a beetroot before I remembered that oxygen is a thing. I also took a wrong turn and felt that icy cold dread where everything tingles and the colour drains from your face. Seriously, just getting the little voice inside to pipe up with ""Breathe!"" Saved the day a few times. 

- Try to put the past behind you. I made what I thought would be two fail-worthy errors, but tried telling myself ""just maybe..."" And it turned out that my reactions after the errors worked in my favour. As soon as you panic, you make more mistakes, which the examiner is tallying up. If you can acknowledge the mistake and say ""yup, that just happened. Anyway, let's carry on, what's next?"" Then you're onto a winner.

If there's anything else that anyone wants to know, please feel free to message me. Best of luck in your endeavours, my anxious friends. Remember to breathe ;)

782,(Anxiety Hack) You Don’t Have To Figure Out Your Whole Life Problem Right This Second,"I am a person who has anxiety. I was reminded of this today when I was reading a legal document and by the end I felt nauseous. I realized this is because while I was reading through each of the stipulations, I was creating outliers in my mind of far-fetched, hypothetical situations in which I could be legally culpable of doing the wrong thing.

The thing about anxiety is that it’s progressive. So as soon as I have these little “what if I do something wrong one day” worries I remember that overall in my life I am also worried about how much my credit card bill is going to be for December since I can’t remember which gifts I put on it and whether my doctor is going to renew my prescription without me having to go in and see him like I said I would last time he renewed it and that I still haven’t painted over the place in my wall where I moved a chair and scratched up the paint. Anxiety is an exhausting thing to have.

What should be obvious, but never is, to anxiety sufferers is that you don’t have to fix your life all at once. We have to learn to sever the connections between all the things we’re nervous about.

I think it’s the natural conclusion of anxiety-thoughts that you have to figure out a solution RIGHT now. I know i’ve gotten out of bed enough times at 3am to make a list of things I’m going to do in order to assuage my anxiety just enough to sleep to know that planning and fixing is really the only that that helps halt anxiety symptoms. So we assume that we have anxiety because we need to fix stuff.

“If only I could figure out my life, I wouldn’t be dealing with these thoughts.”

Unfortunately, the thoughts won’t go away, you’ll just find something else to fixate on. For instance, I generally have anxiety about money topics. There’s no rhyme or reason to it, it just happens to be my biggest trigger. My friend who is unemployed currently, has a much bigger reason than I do to have money-related anxiety, yet what she fixates on is how people perceive her. Yet another friend with anxiety constantly struggles with thinking she is doing a terrible job at her work, where her bosses seem to love her in reality. None of our anxieties are tied to a real life problem, just to a perceived inadequacy. Fixing each individual problem won’t make our internal process of perceiving inadequacy go away. When you cut off one head of the beast, it simply grows another.

This is why it is liberating to say “I don’t have to fix my life.” Some part of our lives, by nature of being human, will always be imperfect. Chasing perfection is a red herring, it distracts us from the real goal, which is to figure out how to be happy in the midst of imperfection. Fixing your problems is unrelated to happiness. Do whatever it takes to internalize this reality. I’m doing that, and I hope, eventually it will be so internalized my anxiety will have no choice but to listen. ",14,2016-11-14 05:14:55 EST-0500
783,Being black and having anxiety,"Hey guys :) I'm a 24 y/o black female, have had pretty intense anxiety from as early as I can remember. One way it manifests is that my mind races like crazy. I'll have one thought and the next thing I know, 3 hours have passed and I've been sitting in the same spot thinking of every possible scenario/negative thought on any given issue my brain decided to create. 

Recently, my mind is consumed with one thing. Having anxiety already sucks, but being a black girl, I just feel really alone. None of my black friends acknowledge this kind of thing. I don't know ANY other black people that suffer from this shit. I've opened up to close friends about it, and being mainly Christians, they say ""oh just pray about it"".

**The Process:**

This part may vary at different hospitals but this is how it went for me. I drove to the ER at 11:30am Saturday. They did some basic vitals, took all my belongings and locked them in a safe, and had me sit on a bed in the hallway. I saw a doctor and told him what was going on, and he didn't think I was in immediate danger so he told me to wait there until the psych lady came down. 6 hours of sitting on the bed, watching someone almost die in the room next to me, and the security guard giving me weird looks, the psych triage lady came to see me. 

She talked with me, and offered me a choice of just going home, going to an outpatient program, or going to an inpatient facility. Since I was so scared I'd act on these thoughts I opted for inpatient hospitalization. She told me their current population was more drug related so she found me a facility an hour away that had more people like me and another 5 hours later (11:40pm) the ambulance was ready to take me. This was the only scary part because they wrapped me in two blankets and strapped me onto the stretcher (belt at the calves, thighs, then a 4 point harness on my chest) but the EMT's were super cool and knew I wouldn't try to hurt them so I could move and stuff. I wish I got their names because they were probably the nicest two people I have met in a while. An hour and a half ride later and I was there. Also I smelled like BO from the hot ambulance.

It was sometime passed midnight at this point so the facility was quiet, security wheeled me in and I met with two guys who took my vitals, gave me the clothes and items I was allowed to have, then took me to the doctor. I met with the weekend doctor, she wasn't very good, she was from another country and had a thick accent and didn't really have any emotions but she was a little funny toward the end. The nurse was really nice and showed me to my room (more on that later) and I tried to sleep. I was having a lot of anxiety so I went to the med station to get an Ativan, but while I was waiting I had a panic attack and she took me to the quite room that had flowers on the walls and a bathroom in it. Started dry heaving, then got my Ativan, and went to bed somewhere around 2am Sunday morning. 

**The Mental Hospital:**

Ah yes the real reason you read this. It was...pretty nice actually. I shared a room with another guy though it was a co-ed wing. He was cool didn't talk much. We each had a bed, night stand, light, and a chair. We also had a shared bathroom with the room next to us. The first day I wasn't allowed to have shoelaces but I got those the second day, as well as privileges to go outside 3 times a day with other patients for a walk in the court yard (beautiful trees and plants and what not). Items I wasn't allowed were my hairspray, hair gel, cologne, gum, metal can of walnuts, comb, and hat. I was allowed to have towels, soap, toothbrush, deodorant, books, magazines, pens, and a notebook. Cell phones and computers were strictly prohibited. 

The wing had a common room (board games, puzzles, and a TV lounge), showers, dining hall, nursing offices, and 2 phones. The staff was my favorite part. My doctor/psychiatrist and case worker were kind of stern which I didn't like but the nurses and techs were amazing. They played games with us and I talked to tons of them about current events and stuff. The patients were also really good people, all ages, dealing with all sorts of things, but all of them very nice. I met a lot of people I will never forget and since people didn't stay there very long I didn't get to say goodbye to some of them before they left. 

**My Improvements:**

I was there for a total of 3 days. In those 3 days they changed my medication to Effexor. I think it's working but it's too early to tell as I'm still coming off the Zoloft. Suicidal thoughts are gone but the homicidal ones are still there. Since there wasn't a ton to do I ended up thinking a lot, and I was constantly worried I would hurt someone or become some sort of criminal. They have definitely gotten better though. We had some group therapy but I didn't find that overly helpful because everyone had such different problems it was hard to relate/get skills from half of what the therapist taught us. Also like I said I wasn't a huge fan of my psych so I wasn't able to open up with her as much.

What helped me the most was seeing other patients worse off than me improve drastically and the positive attitudes of the staff

**Moving Forward:**

So now I'm home, my anxiety is still kind of bad but I'm eating again, and the racing thoughts about committing bad things have gone down a ton now that I can drive and go on reddit. I'm also having some headaches and brain zaps from Zoloft and I was super agitated when I got home.

I start a 1 week outpatient day program tomorrow which I hope will work. I'm also going to work closely with my new psychologist and they found me a psychiatrist while I was there (literally impossible before) so that's cool. I'm kind of afraid to mention that the homicidal thoughts are still there but I don't even have a plan for them, just the worry of becoming a killer (I read the Colorado movie theater shooter was on Zoloft - that didn't help) because I feel like they will send me back, but probably not. I've literally never hurt a soul in my 20 years on this earth and all I am is nice to people. One time I stepped on a bug when I was little and cried for an hour - and I gave my roommate a game before I left so I can't be that bad of a guy right? 

Anyways that's my story! I hope this helps anyone who might feel the need to go to the hospital eventually. In my experience do it if you need to. The mental hospital was no where near as bad as I thought and tbh I probably didn't need to be there but it was a good safety measure. I have fond memories of the hospital now that it's all said and done. Hopefully it gets better from here! ",14,2016-11-10 05:04:38 EST-0500
786,Generalized Anxiety Disorder? Get a Kitten.,"I'm posting this as someone with undiagnosed and recently discovered GAD. Though I'm undiagnosed, there is not a single doubt in my mind I have it after reading the symptoms. 

I've been searching online for months now trying to find ways of coping with it because I can't get counseling this semester (free on campus). 

Before I realized I had GAD, I'd gotten a kitten for my birthday. A sweet little girl all black that had to suffer a five hour drive back to my hometown the day after being separated from her siblings. 

At first, her being a kitten, she was torturing me and my anxiety. Kittens are demanding, and she upped my stress levels tenfold. She's also so reckless, and literally everytime I left her alone in my room to go to class I pictured her killing herself somehow and I'd have panic attacks all day. 

That was nearly two months ago. Now, without it being super apparent, I've realized just how much she's helped me. Yes, that initial time raising her was torture, but now I would 100% classify her as a support animal. 

She has helped in so many ways. Being worried 24/7 about her wellbeing has helped me practice reassuring myself. Before her, I NEEDED reassurance from SOMEONE else to calm down. I could tell myself the same thing as they would, but it wouldn't work. Now, it's easier for me to tell myself, ""Megan, she's fine. She's been fine for two months."" and BELIEVE myself. 

She got me over my fear of beginning to drive. We had a situation one day where I was scared she would die (throwing up and I'm a new kitten mom, got so scared) and I realized that day that despite my fear of driving, I NEEDED a car. I needed a way to get her to a vet without relying on anyone else. Obviously I'm still scared of driving, but she was the motivation to push me to start doing it. 

She makes me less scared of isolation. I love to be alone, but usually it would lead to panic attacks because I was by myself and able to think. Now when I start thinking I play with my kitten, which is more than distracting enough. 

She's still a handful, and still young, but I've noticed I'm no longer anxious about her, and about a few things in my life. My anxiety is nowhere near ""cured"" but she's helped significantly. Watching her grow, and raising her, has proven to me that I AM more responsible than I ever realized. 

**Edit:** Just wanted to add that she's proven to me that I can hold someone else's life in my hands and come out of it with BOTH of us better off (she's a sweet as sin kitten, my roommates are good at telling me I've done well with her), and therefore, I CAN take control of my own life and become better off as well. It'll just take me some time. 

Obviously, this isn't advice that will work with everyone. It's just a suggestion for those interested that I've found has really helped me. ",42,2016-11-12 16:34:27 EST-0500
787,I had a panic attack at my new job today,[deleted],11,2016-11-09 01:50:50 EST-0500
788,I just semi-conquered my fear of getting a job and I think I got hired!,"So I am graduating from college in December. I really need a new MacBook and while looking for jobs in my field I found a UPS seasonal helper. Even though I saw that it's pretty easy to get in (have a pulse, can life 70 lbs, can follow instructions) I was still anxious about the interview. 

Turns out there really wasn't even an interview. There was about 30 people of all shapes sizes and ages, the very nice and cheery girl told us the basic responsibilities and her story of how she started from our positions. She said she will be hiring 600 people this season so I think we all got hired on the spot basically. We filled out a form on which areas we wanted to work and info about us. She called a few people back at a time to an office which was the ""interview"" part. She made me write my social down and asked if I had any questions. I just told her my school schedule for the rest of the semester and she said that would be no issue at all and boom done. Didn't hurt that she went to the same school and subject as me! She said she will call in a couple days. 

I am super excited!",13,2016-11-09 23:45:08 EST-0500
789,Phone anxiety,"Does anyone else deal with this? How do you explain it to people who just DON'T get it?

The idea of calling some place like the doctor's office or a store causes so much anxiety. I don't mind calling a family member or a good friend, but anything else is too...unpredicable, I guess. I still ask my mom to make my hair appts and things like that (and I'm 29) and she does, because she's a super nice mom like that, not because she knows about my anxiety at all. 

I worked a summer job for a few years at a call centre. It was literally the worst. When I started at the company it was in a position that required zero phone calls, but as I gained seniority each summer I got offered higher pay jobs. Cue the call centre position. Great pay, and I was fairly good at it, but EVERY TIME the phone rang my heart would pound. I would find reasons to go on 'not ready' for an amount of time that was long but not long enough to have the supervisors question me. And I cut corners by not making the outbound calls that I technically should have. 

I lasted 4 summers in this job, which was actually pretty amazing. By the last summer, I had to drag myself out of bed. This past summer, I finally got up the nerve to turn it down (with the encouragement of my therapist who pointed out that it wasn't worth it to be stressed and unhappy for the two months that I'm technically supposed to have time off work as a teacher). And of course EVERYONE had an opinion about it, because they don't know about my anxiety. Those who at least know I don't like talking on the phone thought I was 'silly' and 'giving up a lot', and those who didn't know anything thought I was 'lazy' for 'not working 12 months of the year like everyone else does'. 

So if anyone has the same phone anxiety, how do you try to explain it to people?",22,2016-11-12 11:22:53 EST-0500

806,Today I took a big step and went to my school's counseling center [Progress],"After another full blown panic attack, and an exceptionally rough first week back at my university, I decided that it was time to go seek professional help. I've always dealt with generalized anxiety and obsessive compulsive disorder, but never went and got the help that I needed. I've usually been decent at managing my symptoms, but since moving back to school I've had a difficult time adjusting, thus causing a lot of stress, anxiety, and symptoms of depression.

So, I made an appointment at my school's counseling center. I filled out a questionnaire describing my symptoms, and I consulted with one of the professionals about how I was feeling. It felt so good to actually be validated and have someone take my disorder seriously. However, this meeting's purpose was only to be a brief evaluation of how I was feeling, so that I could be matched with one of the counselors to meet with on a consistent basis. 

Initially, I was very nervous about this meeting (of course), but I'm so glad that I took this first step. I can't wait to start my actual counseling sessions and start making some more progress :)

This is not including my gf and best friend that message me pretty constantly but anyone else I find myself just leaving the message and not opening it for days at a time or I'll spend hours panicking over what I could say. I guess you could say I don't want to commit to something over text or let people down I'm not quite sure why I feel like this I just wanted to know if anyone else is in the same boat

821,"Left an hour into work after vomiting due to bug/gastro, discovered everyone at work thinks I'm a flake who fakes being sick","For the last year I've been stuck working a god awful factory job that has me working mainly nights doing mind numbing work, the perfect environment for my anxiety to take hold and intrusive thoughts to take over to the point of panic attacks and nausea.

This has meant that I often (perhaps once every 2nd or 3rd week recently) go home sick (for which I'm not paid, as I am only a casual).

Tonight I vomited at work in a bucket in front of everyone, due not to anxiety but being actually sick (my 1 year old has been squirting out both ends, so I'm guessing I caught it off him). Ten minutes prior I had to run to the toilet because I thought I was going to be sick, and earlier today I had a massive case of the runs but decide to plow on and go to work tonight anyway.

So I go and tell my leading hand I'm going home due to being sick, and before I can finish saying that I had just vomited there in front of people he says ""The boss said you'd do that"". This is something who had lead me to believe they considered me a friend. Fuck that.

I then do the right thing as I leave and go to tell the supervisor (something most people wouldn't bother with), and I get a similar response from him, carrying on that I'm always going home sick (his wife works with me, and is the laziest person there, who throws genuine sickies all the time).

I'm desperately hoping I won't be in this job much longer, as I applied for a job last week (that I was hoping to hear about already, so that hasn't done much of my anxiety). But money is super tight and I need it until I find something else.

Now I do end up going home sick more often than most, half the time this is due to panic attacks, and the other half of the time is being genuinely sick (having young kids means you're constantly picking up bugs). But I can't stand the thought of people thinking I'm a flake. Particularly as I feel that when I'm there I put in more effort than most others, and despite the shitty conditions and unpredictability of work (I never know, when, if or how much I'm working until the Friday before each week), I've stuck it out for over a year (during that time they've had over a dozen casuals come and go).

Now that I know people think of me this way it's driving me crazy. What do I do?

Should I tell my boss about my anxiety and explain that it's the cause of a lot of these issues (not sure how well that would go down, or if it would stay private, as I work and live in a small country town)?

Should I be more vague and just explain that an ongoing condition is to explain for a lot of these absences? 

Or do I somehow try to learn to not give a fuck? (not very likely)
  
&nbsp;

*Update*

My 5 year old just woke up projectile vomiting. So at least I can be assured that tonight is really a case of being sick, and not just my anxiety manifesting itself into physical symptoms.

&nbsp;

*Update 2*

Called up the boss to get my hours next week. He mentioned nothing so I didn't either (too scared that in my pissed off state I'd start to have a go at him which won't help things). As it was, it took a Valium beforehand to get to the point of feeling well enough to make the call.

Found out I have no hours next week (which means I probably won't be able to pay the rent next week). I'm suspiciousthat this is to 'teach me a lesson', but hard to know when to my face he acts like he has no problem (but I suspect he does).

It at least puts this little drama to rest for now. Which leaves my anxious energies to be directed towards worrying about money (more than usual) and freaking out about not hearing back about a job that I thought I was a really good chance of getting.

&nbsp;

Sometimes I have days where I start to question if I have an anxiety issue at all. Then I have weeks like this where I feel like anxiety has completely ruined my life and left me with no resources to get it back on track. Fuck. This. Shit.",14,2016-01-28 15:39:56 EST-0500

Almost all of them I quit due to the pressure to get along with my coworkers. I'm not unfriendly but I'm very deer in the headlights and too serious; I can't be myself at all and usually won't say a word because I'm always in full panic mode, worrying what they think about me. I don't really have any friends (not surprisingly due to my anxiety) so the pressure to befriend them weighs down on me. Whenever I get critiqued for not talking at the job, I shut down and never try again to talk and lose the ability to be happy there to where I can't even force a smile, making people dislike me even more . It's really bad and I don't know how to stop it, I'm about to quit my current job because I just can't handle it. I cant even be fully comfortable around my boyfriend of a year. I'm not on any meds, I did tons of therapy as a teenager, I feel like I know why I'm like this inside and out but I can't break it or take the step of just being myself.  

This is out of desperation please help me :/",2,2016-01-22 08:33:46 EST-0500

828,I think more needs to be done for people who properly suffer with anxiety. This weekend made me realise some people don't actually understand this is a real mental illness,"So long and short of the story I have a girlfriend who suffers with anxiety. We were due to attend a family event together but, as she has only just started therapy, she didn't feel comfortable in going to the do. 

I informed family, some by text due to the time restraints on getting everyone told, some face to face. One members response, not directly to me but another member of family, ""we all suffer with anxiety don't we?"" 

So this got me to thinking, do people actually understand what it's like to have anxiety as an actual mental illness? Do people who might be a bit anxious about having an interview, meeting or something along those lines think that's the only form of anxiety you can have and that when it's over and done with you're miraculously cured? It was a comment that really irked me. 

I don't really know what I'm trying to say here but I feel that this is something that gets over looked and that not enough people understand the actual illness where people suffer constantly with this issue and more should be done to help raise awareness so people understand more. 

All I'll say to all of you on here is stay strong use the support you have around you and don't let people's comments about something being daft or stupid or that you're worrying over nothing make you doubt yourself. Be honest and be truthful when people tell you you're stupid tell them you're not don't sit quietly and suffer in silence. ",63,2016-06-14 00:34:43 EDT-0400
829,When I hear people laugh I always assume its at my expense.,"Its so strange because, I know they're not. Like logicaly I know everyone who is just laughing cant be laughing at me. But for some reason its like my knee jerk reaction. And even when I tell myself. ""Hey they're probably not even paying attention to you, you're not even on these peoples radar"" And hey, even if they were, like fuckem. I feel like I *shouldn't* care what people think ideally, but I guess I still do. Anyways, even if I tell myself all the logical reasons why they're probably not laughing at me, or ask myself what the advantage to caring would be, still I, I have this feeling like they are or it still effects me emotionally in one way or another. 

I know sometimes, some people might laugh. I'm sometimes awkward or clumsy but ""even the pros mess up"" and everyone has their moments. And really, I might laugh too If I was them. But it's not all the time. My knee-jerk reaction is almost always ""they're laughing at you"".

I feel like people are talking about me 'behind my back' as well. And again, I know this is probably not true, but even when I tell myself that, dude you arn't even on the radar bro. I still cant shake the feeling.

I was out practicing my basketball shot today and there were a group of 'loud guys' gathered around a truck in the parking lot near by. They were laughing and talking loud and in general having a good time. They probably couldn't see me very well, but they could hear me playing, and every time they'd laugh I'd wonder about if it was something I did.

Im a fair player and I had all these thoughts like ""You wouldn't laugh at me if you played me"" (so serious) but hahah it's very likely that they would with that attitude.  
Regardless of what I told myself, It seemed like when they would talk real loud or laugh it would effect my shots for the worse.

These guys are probably really nice and considerate, and would probably be very fun to hang out with/ play ball with/ whatever if I could get over my nerves and insecurities. I mean, they could be total assholes, the kind of people to leave broken glass on the beach, or throw a bottle at you at a dark field party or something just to get a rise out of someone or start a fight. 

But I think most people are friendly and cool and Its the minority of people who will actually pick on someone.

But I wonder, because these ""kind of guys"" (loud, social, unstifled, lots of friends) were the kind of guys that used to pick on me in highschool...

It might be some kind of conditioning from highschool where I did get picked on a lot. 
Where people did indeed say kind of nasty thing about me etc. 

Even after highschool Ive had some experiences where I feel like people were picking on me, but maybe I was just interpreting their actions as hostile when it could have been something else.

My question is, is this something I should see a mental health professional about? Ive heard this kind of thing could be paranoia. 

Is it a conditioned response?

Or is it just my insecurities flaring up?

830,"Does anyone feel that social media sites like Facebook, Twitter and other sites excluding Reddit make you feel anxious and depressed?","Honestly, I've always been hard on myself and compared myself to others and I feel like social media is making my anxiety worse. I felt fairly depressed when I looked at all my friends and acquaintances having fun without me and I felt anxious that they never really wanted me there when they invite me and they'll talk shit about me.

831,I finally sought professional help for my anxiety,"I'm going to preface this by saying that I am a 25 year old male living in the northwest. I share a showspace with 4 roommates and my dog. I've been experiencing low-levels of anxiety my entire life, with the effects of it gradually 'ramping up' to the point they are at now. The first debilitating panic attack I experienced was this time last year. I had to leave my work and felt uncomfortable even taking the bus home. Since then it's gotten more prevalent in my life and the panic attacks have been way more intense. 


I'm a heavy drinker, I smoke a fair amount of weed, and have dabbled with psychedelic use and pharmaceuticals. After my panic attack yesterday I am trying to stop drinking, and believe that I may have been experiencing/still experiencing DTs. This last weekend was my birthday and I spent thursday-sunday drinking heavily, smoking weed, and not taking care of myself. All of this activity hit me like a brick wall around 5pm yesterday. I spent most of the day nursing a hangover, and slept until 2 in the afternoon. I was watching TV around 5 when I started feeling the panic attack brewing inside me. My chest started feeling heavy, I was having difficulty swallowing, my vision was blurred, classic panic attack. My panic attacks come in waves and remind me somewhat of an acid flashback, except for the trips are bad, and more subtle than your regular acid hallucinations. I have an over-whelming feeling of discomfort, I can't seem to focus on my breath, and my vision is warbled. It's been ridiculously hot the last couple of days, and I figured I'd take a cold shower to alleviate my anxiety. This only made things worse as it put my body in a weird sort of shock, where I couldn't feel anything.


 I called my girlfriend, and she came over to my aid. After a couple hours of experiencing these symptoms in waves, I decided I had had enough and went to urgent care to get evaluated. The doctor prescribed me with about 15 or so 50mg pills of hydroxyzine. I've been eating them in halves, having consumed 100 mg every 4 hours or so since last night. I feel the effects of the drug as a light grogginess, enough to put me to sleep and deal with the fatigue of detox. The doctor set me up for psych evaluation and I'm going to get my head checked up next week. I've been putting off visiting the doctor for so long and I'm glad my girlfriend helped convince me to go through with it. I'm working on cutting alcohol out of my life completely, and am still weary about self-medicating with weed, and becoming dependent on the hydroxyzine. My advice to everyone out there is to seek the help you need, even if your wrong with your self-diagnosis, the comfort of having a doctor check me out, and the ability to sleep and go about things pseudo normally today have made this experience extremely worth it for me.",20,2016-06-08 00:58:52 EDT-0400
832,Wanted to share a small victory,"I've been struggling with anxiety for years now.  I feel like it's always lurking nearby, and holding me back from the person I really want to be.  My significant other dumped me about a month ago.  She had been my buffer for dealing with other people, so now that I'm on my own, I've been struggling even more.  

But today I had a little victory that seems worth celebrating.  When I was younger I used to go out boating all the time.  I always found paddling to be really relaxing. Lately I've been wanting to get back into it, but I've struggled to get passed my anxiety to leave the house on my own, rent a kayak, and go out on the lake.  

Well today I did just that!  I had to work up to it slowly, starting with getting use to driving to the rental place, and then hanging out in the nearby park until I felt comfortable with the area, but once I got out on the water again it was all totally worth it!  ",23,2016-06-13 04:57:40 EDT-0400

834,How do i break away from victim mentality?,"I exaggerate the flaws of other people. I get really jealous a lot of the time. I don't have confidence in myself, and I'm not self-sufficient. When I fail, I either beat on myself unrealistically or I blame someone else instead of taking a rational look at what happened. I try to get people to pity and acknowledge me, and when they don't, I feel despised.

I didn't realize that I had a victim mentality for years and years, and now I just feel guilty about it. I'm not sure how to break free of it. I've tried to apologize to those I've hurt, but for the most part, they say that I've done nothing wrong. I'm trying to care for myself for once, but it makes me feel really bad to not prioritize the well-being of others over my own. I also feel very reluctant to ask others for help, with fear that it'll just turn into me shouting, ""PITY ME!"" in their faces.

It seems to me that I've dug myself into a hole without realizing how large it is, and now, I don't know how to climb out of it.",11,2016-06-11 19:36:24 EDT-0400

I finally went and saw a therapist yesterday. 

My therapist made me realize that yes, I was emotionally and verbally abused as a child. And he made me excited to work on this. I know that's such a weird adjective to use in this context but I am so excited to work on myself.

838,For anyone who has experienced Panic attacks/depersonalization triggered by marijuana,"Hello all, 

I began doing some research on Reddit and was very interested to see how many people on here share a similar story about their first panic attack or depersonalization episode being triggered by smoking marijuana.

I too had this experience when I was about 14 years old and had reoccurring panic attacks and depersonalization for years to follow. 

I have done relentless research and inner work in order to heal myself from my anxiety. I am medication free and live a low anxiety life. 

In regards to the marijuana induced panic attack experience, I have a perspective and some information about this that I have not found anywhere on this subreddit and feel the need to share. 

For years I thought I triggered some mental illness by smoking pot. It seemed that during my first major panic attack (which was induced by marijuana) I was in a dream-like state, felt like I was going to die, and began to lose touch with reality (called depersonalization). For years after this event, I could almost will myself into a panic attack/depersonalization simply by reliving that original experience within my imagination. 

It wasn't until recently - some 14 years later - that I was having a conversation with a psychologist friend of mine, explaining this story to her. She asked me a few questions about my experience and calmly suggested to me, ""you had/have PTSD"". I was surprised to hear that since I had never heard the suggestion before, but continued to look into it. 

I quickly realized, she had a strong argument. For anyone unaware, PTSD is defined as *""an anxiety disorder that can develop after experiencing or witnessing a traumatic event, or learning that a traumatic event has happened to a loved one. DSM5 defines a traumatic event as exposure to actual or threatened death, serious injury, or sexual violence.""*

In short, the first panic attack or depersonalization experience feels like a near death experience. It is intensely traumatic and mimics threatened death. 

I also found a statement (sorry I can't find the source) listing that over 50% of people who experience depersonalization suffer from ptsd.

So, in conclusion, I wish for anyone interested to do some simple google searches with terms ""PTSD + ANXIETY"" and ""PTSD + DEPERSONALIZATION"" (or dissociation) 

There is much to this, so I won't write too much here. If anyone has questions about my own experience, please feel free to DM me. 

Hope this helps!

839,"Fuck anxiety. Seriously, fuck it.","I've struggled with anxiety for most of my life (I had my first phobia at age 2, and then my social anxiety kicked in around age 3), and at 29 years old, that's a pretty damned long time to be struggling. And I'm just sick and tired of it at this point. I feel so discouraged by the fact that I haven't been able to overcome any (or all) of my anxiety disorders yet, and so exhausted by the daily battles against my anxiety that I have to wage. I just want to give up and wave my proverbial white flag. I give in. I'm done. No mas. If only it were actually possible to give up in this fight. But, unfortunately, the only real way to give up against anxiety is to kill yourself, and I've promised my parents multiple times that I wouldn't ever do that, so I'm just stuck. Stuck and exhausted and frustrated and angry.

846,is it possible to develop anxiety after trying a new drug or being a drinker?,"I am terrified I have chronic anxiety now, after years of having it and keeping it control. 

On May 31st, I did Molly for the first time. It was pretty amazing so I decided to have my boyfriend try it. We did it together and really enjoyed ourselves and had the best time together in a long time. Then, on the 10th of June we did it again. I know this is a terrible choice  seeing as you're only supposed to do Molly once every couple months. I Did not know this so we took the dose as normal. 
Well, he seemed to have a pretty good experience rolling but mine never really started. 
Since I know this is not /r/drugs (which I have written to them about this too) I will not go into much more detail about the Molly. 
It may be important to add that I am also a drinker and have been for the past 4 years. I never used to get this Feeling when I woke up after a night of drinking. But ever since I did the Molly I have been waking up with the worst anxiety I ever have had. About my relationship. 
This scares me quite a lot since I have been with this man for 5 years now. I am hoping this all blows over, since I do not want to be having such anxiety over the man I love. 
I am wondering if I should just cut drinking out of my life for good now that it feels like I might have some trouble with this Feeling. I wake up with no spit in my mouth and feeling like a house was dropped on me. I just want to feel normal again and I am scared that this is what it is now.

849,Living with social anxiety and depression... I'd like some help if at nothing else to help gain social skills/ friends,"I hope I can make it through this.

Alright, so I've been living with my disorders for a while now, and I'd been doing decently with coping, I had my two best friends to help me out, but I recently graduated college and now I'm without their support. Now I'm alone with my own mind and things are getting worse as far as convincing myself to go and try to do things outside my room. I want so badly to go and try to make friends with new people, but then my anxiety kicks in and I start to freak out over meeting with new people and trying to talk to them, so then I just avoid that chance at all and then my depression tags in and kicks me when I'm down.

Example, I want to go find a place to play MTG somewhere, but then my anxiety kicks in and things like 'what if you're the oldest person there?' or 'what if no one wants to talk to you' or 'what if everyone thinks you're weird' or 'what if people won't like you' and the big one that haunts me for everything 'what if people are just being tolerant of you and they don't want anything to do with you?' Now apply those 'what if' statements with everything else in my life, and that's roughly what I deal with on a daily basis. With each missed oppertunity my depression creeps in and pretty much knocks me down to the point of making myself feel worthless, and that I don't want to crawl out of bed in the mornings because I'm such a F*** up.

I honestly don't know how to make friends any more, I only had my two friends because of classes, but now that I'm out of college I don't even know where to go find others who would be interested in the same things as I do. It seems like all my hobbies are solitary things anyhow, video games, writing, and reading. How would I even meet new people? What Would I say? Would I annoy them? For that matter, I can't even make friends online, I don't feel right just messaging a person because we may be in the same FB community, it just seems weird.

I'm a very shy person, so that doesn't help anything either. I've never been good at talking to strangers, basically because I think that I'd be a bother to them or they won't be interested in talking to me. I'm writing this here because I hope that someone out there knows what I'm going through and can help me better myself. I'm tired of living like this, and I want to better myself, I just don't know how and I just can't take living in isolation anymore.

Sorry for the length of this, I kinda just let my mind run.

UPDATE 6/12/16
Thank you everyone for giving me your encouragement, it means a lot to me. As far as medication goes I was on a variety of different ones for 3 years just trying to see what would help me, but nothing did the trick and the therapist at the time suggested I get off of them to see how I would fee. I think I hit my one jackpot in life because I felt the same off as I did on meds. I'm trying to find a therapist, but with no job it kinda makes things hard. I just want to say thank you all so much for being so cool, the world needs more cool people like you all :D",7,2016-06-11 01:46:58 EDT-0400

851,Positive post! I made it through my first quarter back at college in THREE YEARS with straight A's!,"I feel the need to gloat a little. Not gloat, but tell someone! Today was my last day of class. I took two classes, Lifespan Psychology and Intro to Digital Photography. I've been taking photos for 10 years but finally got to take my first actual class, and I love Psych/hope to major in Psych and work in the field in the future.

I haven't been in class since Winter quarter of 2013. My life was slowly falling apart and was officially in shambles by March of 2013. I didn't even withdraw, I just stopped going and failed, and was placed on academic dismissal. I won't get into everything that happened between March 2013 and March 2014, but it was pretty bad, and the culmination of many years of trauma and issues I had not dealt with, plus one big huge thing on top (I was sexually assaulted). I took 2014 & 2015 to work hard on my health, my mental health, and myself. I got my own stable place for the first time in a long time, good jobs (as a nanny), fell in love (am still in love), and started living semi-normally... aside from severe anxiety. Which is something I've always had, but it has gotten more severe since 2014. Panic attacks regularly. Daily struggles to know what is something to worry about or something to ignore. Most of 2014 I was miserable. I didn't think I would ever live a normal life or be able to go back to school.

Well I did. And I finished today with straight A's. And I haven't been having an easy time, even. I got sick three times, and when I get sick my anxiety flares up REALLY bad. I have an ovarian cyst, my sister was hospitalized, I went through some weird emotional stuff (I mean... who doesn't sometimes though)... yet somehow I fucking DID IT. I feel so proud. There were some days I wanted to give up and never go back. But I did it and I haven't felt so great in so long. I'm less than a year away from getting my AA finally and I'm so proud of myself.

Ranting here... but it is possible. My anxiety hasn't been debilitating as of late, or else I would not be able to attend school. But some days, it was. Some weeks, I had panic attacks between classes. But I did it. And I'm still in one piece. It IS possible.",11,2016-03-23 09:48:30 EDT-0400

853,I finally went to the E.R. about my health anxiety.,"A couple days ago I posted here explaining my constant 24/hr anxiety and panic episodes and how I was thinking about going to the doctors to get checked out. So here's the story,
This morning I woke up to my heart fluttering in my chest so I woke up my boyfriend and told him once again I think there's something wrong with my heart. He listens to my heart and says ""okay I can hear some irregularities let's go."" Hearing those words you have no idea how scary and suureal It felt  to think I was going to find something life changing about my health. So When I get into the hospital I feel at the peak of my dizziness and luckily got a room right away. The doctor comes in and runs an ekg which I was mortified would come back with  bad news. It didn't and my heart was perfectly normal but to make sure he set me on a heart monitor to keep an eye on it in case I had more palpitations. But basically ruled me as having a severe panic attack.
Throughout the rest of the morning I had a lot of counselors come and talk to me about how I felt, what was going on in my life currently and in the past that might have brought me to this point in my life now. Needless to say I broke down and let it all out. I spoke out about my constant obsessive thoughts about dying, my living situation, struggles with myself, self harm and all things that were deep inside that needed to come out that i haven't even thought about in years. It really made me feel good to have support for once that wasn't me reading shit online or asking  for support from people who dont understand how crippling anxiety and panic can be.
Anyway, after talking to many counselors and after many tears they told me about an inpatient program that is from 9-3 everyday that focuses on group therapy,  emotional intervention and recieving intensive help from mental health professionals. So I am going to do it. And I am so excited to start the first step in receiving the treatment I need. Thank you for reading. I hope that anyone who is feeling scared or anxious knows that it's okay  to face your fears because after you know the truth all that's left is getting better.",20,2016-03-22 23:27:05 EDT-0400

Just because I can't stand the sound of my own heartbeat. Of course I love my heart, y'know since it's kind of the only reason I'm alive.

858,Dealing with morning anxiety.,"For a lot of us with anxiety disorders, the morning is one of - if not THE - toughest parts of the day. Soon after waking up your mind is already jumping ahead to the day's tasks, and no matter how mundane these tasks may be, our anxious minds makes them all seem monumental: making food, showering, driving to work, working a full day, socializing, trying to act normal, etc. The idea of leaving the house and entering this big & scary world becomes a daunting and nerve wrecking task in and of itself, and hiding in bed seems like the best option. Trust me, I know what this feels like.

Well, there are a number of ways to deal with this morning anxiety, and some don't even require you to leave your bed. 

1) Exercise. I have found that the BEST way to kick morning anxiety is exercise: running, biking, or even going for a morning walk. It is an AWESOME way to start the day. However, I know it's not always possible due to lack of energy/motivation or other reason. 

2) Meditation. Breathing exercises and guided meditations are a great way to easily bring your mind back to the present instead of worrying about the day ahead. I've used the apps 'Breathe' and 'Calm', which are both great. Breathe has morning meditations which allow you to destress without even leaving the comfort of your bed. 

3) Yoga. I don't mean going to a yoga class or doing some extravagant hour-long yoga session. A nice 8-10 minute morning yoga session works well with meditation to help bring your focus to your breath and focus on the present. I use the app 'Daily Yoga' which has a great morning yoga routine.

Hope this helps somebody. Take care all.",18,2016-03-26 18:47:51 EDT-0400
859,my nightmare experience with an airline laughing and mocking my anxiety,"I felt I needed to share this nightmare week with Japan Airlines.

I have anxiety and depression, and along with medication and lifestyle adjustments, I also have an emotional support animal. I know that a lot of people do not agree with or understand having an emotional support animal, but that point is moot - she is licensed, I have the documentation and i am protected by the Air Carrier Access Act if I want to bring her with me on my flight. She is registered with the city government, so I have an assistance dog tag issued by the city. Even though I have the right to put her on my lap, I choose not to because I don't want to inconvenience any staff or passengers with her presence, so I choose to keep her in her carrier under the seat in front of me. She is well trained, does not go to the bathroom at all (during the whole 9-10 hours) and does not bark. Most people don't know she is there and there has never been a complaint.

I have flown with her every year for the past 5-6 years, sometimes twice, when I return to Japan. The people at the airport, the USDA, and the ministry of agriculture staffing Haneda International Airport know me - I always have all my documentation in order and keep on top of everything. I have always notified the airline within 48 hours of BOOKING the flight, even though their website requests 48 hour before BOARDING.

This time was no different. I had all the relevant paperwork, I had my medical notes within one year, I had notified them and they called me a few weeks later to confirm my seat and that everything had been cleared with Haneda. Last week, we got a call from the JAL office in Southern California telling me my documentation was insufficient. They demanded I send my medical paperwork to their generic ""help desk"" email.  I told them I felt uncomfortable and would prefer sending it to a representative that could handle my case, rather than to their ""contact us"" email address. They refused, so I relented sending the note and a photo of the front and back of my city issued assistance dog tag. I asked her why there was suddenly a problem with my flight this time and she claimed I had never flown with them. She made me look up my own previous flight records and give her the dates - all of which are on their website using their mileage bank account. She then said I must have snuck my dog onto the plane or just shown up at the airport with my dog and pushed my way through. I told her that I always gave notice within 48 hours of buying my tickets and she scoffed at me.

The next day they called demanding a ""certificate"" from the US government that another passenger had sent them. After some prying, it turns out someone had recently sent them a certificate from one of those pay websites that make you a fake service dog certificate. (https://www.usservicedogregistry.org/) I informed them that my tag was city government issued and the certificate was a scam. The woman on the phone yelled at me and threatened to ""call the number on the tag"" and that she was going to find out that it was fake. I told her she was more than welcome to call. She wanted to prove to me the certificate was real and my tag was not.

10 minutes later I got a much more subdued phone call from her saying she had called and it did indeed turn out to be the city office and that they assured her the tag was authentic and that my dog was definitely a recognized assistance animal. She said she would get back to me later.

This past Friday, she called saying my doctors note was missing a medical license number so i would need to get a new note. Inconvenient since I fly on Tuesday evening, but I made an appointment with my doctor for Monday (the soonest available) and got a new note with all the relevant information that they requested. I emailed that to them and they said they would get back to me later.

At 8 pm tonight, I received a phone call from a very rude and angry woman at the southern California office saying she wasn't allowing me to board my flight because the medical license number was written as CA LIC # _________ instead of as a sentence stating ""I am licensed in the state of California."" She accused me of faking the license number and said there was no way to recognize the letters CA as California, despite the address of the doctor's letterhead also using CA instead of writing out the word California. We told her she could easily look this up on the medical board website (www.mbc.ca.gov) and verify the doctors name, the license number, the state in which she is licensed to practice, and the year she began practicing medicine. She said we were lying. She then laughed at me having a disability and laughed that I have anxiety and she said she didn't care that it wasn't acceptable for her to deny me access to the flight. She said there is no law or any legal right for me to board the plane even with all the documentation and laughed loudly at both me and my husband while I was in near tears. We tried to tell her how to look up the number and all she did was constantly scream and talk over us and told us to be quiet while laughing at me being disabled.

In tears, my husband and I packed up all our documentation, rented a car, and drove to the airport immediately after. We called someone from JAL at the white courtesy telephone to ask them what we should do because I am supposed to fly tomorrow. The staff that came down knew my name and recognized me as the girl who does this regularly and always has all the proper documentation and that there will be NO problem tomorrow. She checked my documents and assured me that if they call again, to ask they call SFO and check with the staff at the airport because I am cleared to go tomorrow. I felt so much better. The staff at SFO were amazing and very comforting and even though it was a hassle to rent a car late at night to drive out there, it was worth it to know that we were safe.

None of this excuses the behavior of the staff in Southern California. No one should be persecuted and mocked for having anxiety or a disability. I have never had this kind of treatment with an airline. My husband and I both felt attacked particularly after pointing out that they had been given a false document by a previous passenger. Also, those fake websites and fake registries for service animals need to be shut down. It makes things difficult for people who have a medical necessity and have the proper documentation.

All of this was ridiculous. I have not been offered an apology nor any compensation. I just needed to get this out there, it has been a very long week. :(

-------
edit: As of 10:30am, JAL corporate in Tokyo has been in contact with the JAL SFO staff who told them what is what and that I am getting on that plane. The woman who yelled at us last night from their american customer service office called us - and my husband is making a complaint as I type. We are going to do what we can and will discuss with the staff at SFO when I go back for my flight tonight. I cannot stress this enough, the staff that we spoke to in San Francisco at the airport were amazing and are still working on my behalf. I cannot thank them enough for everything. I am sad to think that if I had been a new passenger and the staff not recognized me, that I would be alone with no one in my corner, but hopefully through this nightmare they will overhaul their process in dealing with ESA in the future. If JAL wants to continue service into the US, they will need to comply with our regulations, so something needs to change!

If anyone has any questions about flying with an ESA or what information you need to discuss with your medical provider, feel free to message me. :)

We have slowly worked our way up through their staff in their southern california office and are filing the appropriate complaints. They have been pretty smug saying they are ""allowing me"" by way of their very generous nature to board the plane despite all of our incomplete paperwork. By incomplete they are citing the fact that our doctor wrote CA instead of California. They never sent us any guidelines as to what should be in the letter, we had to research this ourselves and added everything every other airline has listed as necessary and even more detail into my condition than is required. We also redirected them (again) to the specific section of the Air Carrier Access Act on the Department of Transportation website that protect the rights of disabled persons, and we are filing a complaint with the DoT directly.",36,2016-03-22 09:20:09 EDT-0400

861,"Girlfriend called me ""cold"", my mental illness is ruining my fucking life.","I'm not trying to belittle her or bring sympathy to me, she is completely right. She was having a panic attack and I apparently yelled at her over skype. Hearing people have panic attacks and feeling helpless makes me panic, so I was also panicking, doesn't justify it but yeah she said I've been cold for the past while, she said it with lots of bitterness and resentment in her voice, like she was just sick of me. I don't blame her, and I actually feel the same way, that I have become less understanding, more isolated, cold, bitter, removed, numb, etc. But it hurts so so badly hearing someone you just love with all your heart say that. I wanna kill myself again, and might go through with it. She is right, this thing has taken away completely who I am. I am usually empathetic, compassionate, understanding, loving, pessimistic yet optimistic and just kind of humourous about it all, etc. But lately I've been cold, removed, dark, rude, crass, numb, end just wicked and I guess she feels it the most. I don't know what I hope to accomplish by posting this, just that this illness has ruined my life, my personality, my friendships, and now the thing that is literally one of the two things I love for: My relationship with my girlfriend. Wish me luck making it to the end of the fucking year.

864,"Gave up coffee, never going back.","Hey all

23 y/o male with mild/moderate anxiety, diagnosed with PD once (though it was temporary). I used to be a fairly heavy coffee drinker, 2-3 large cups per day (though I know many people have way more). Even though I felt anxious during my coffee drinking stint, I blamed myself for feeling that way and never considered giving up coffee; to me, everyone drank it and it seemed to be a necessity it to be productive at work. I'd experience mood swings, anxiety, and overall discomfort but attributed a lot of this to work stress/other factors. 

Recently went on vacation (drinking more coffee than usual) and noticed that even in the absence of work and it's related stress, I was still experiencing mood swings / depression. I decided to try cutting back on caffeine by switching from coffee to tea, and noticed a nearly instant difference. Mood swings significantly diminished, anxiety lowered, mental clarity increased, sleep improved, and overall state of mind was much better. Caffeine detox wasn't easy, but man it's worth it.

I'm not saying coffee/caffeine is inherently bad, but it is addictive and for some people - especially us with anxiety - we should be watching how much we intake. It's not for everyone. 

Just a thought. Hope somebody finds this helpful.",38,2016-03-23 21:37:56 EDT-0400
865,"When people say ""I'm so OCD""","It's not just some quirk, or all about cleaning

It's not having shoes in a row or liking to sweep

It's not hating odd numbers, that's rather demeaning 

It's the reason I can never fucking sleep 



For me it's thinking your memories must not be right 

It's fearing I'm weird or somehow not a good guy
 
It's the reason I usually stay home at night

While I lock myself in my room and I cry



It's intrusive thought and ever trembling hands 
It's a racing heart and teary eyes

It's a dry mouth and broken plans

It's your mind constantly telling you lies 



Like the lie that I'm fucked up beyond all belief 

The lie that I must've hurt those that care 

The lie that my Time on earth will be brief

The lie that there's something which I'm not aware



So my mind starts this digging, this search for the truth

But there's nothing there which can ease my thinking 

Instead I get stuck in this endless loop 

Which just continues this feeling of sinking 



I'll break it down I'm obsessive in my thoughts

While compulsions are used as a crutch 

Which inturn leaves my stomach in knots 

And I start to feel out of touch



So if you like to be organized or everything square 

If there's one thing I ask then I plea 

If you don't have the thoughts of feel of despair

Then Don't say ""I'm just so OCD"" ",8,2016-03-26 04:56:52 EDT-0400
866,Nostalgia makes me depressed,"I'm pretty sure nostalgia is generally supposed to bring warm feelings. Even though the definition implies a longing for the past, it still generally seems to be a happy longing like ""yah, that was awesome"". But for me, it just fills me with regret and negativity. I just think about how much better things were, or how I could've done things differently to not be where I am now. This happens with lots of things in my past that I'm nostalgic for.

To be more specific about what made me think to post this, I have always loved Japan. I studied abroad there and loved it. My whole college period was based on getting myself to Japan. However, I'm extremely indecisive, so I changed majors a few times, and even entered grad school without thinking and am now gonna drop out after a semester because it's not what I want. It seems the only way left for me to get back is to either become an English teacher and be poor forever and have student loans over my head forever, hardly get to experience much while I'm there, and never get to travel. Or I can hope that I'll get there in another career in 10, 15, 20 years, if I'm lucky.

Thinking about that just kills me. I had accepted for the past month or so that I will be ok living here, cause I still can live in awesome places like Chicago, Seattle, New York, Miami, or some big city. But I saw something (a Wikipedia article about a small train station I frequented in Japan), and it just crushed me. It brought back all those memories and the regret I feel for screwing up my dreams.

I wish I could just be happy where I am. I mean, everyone has grand dreams that go unfulfilled or they know are unlikely, and they seem fine where they are. Why can't I just live in the present and be happy with my life? And why don't I have confidence in myself at all? Cause maybe it is possible. Maybe I could be an entrepreneur or something. But I'm so negative about my future and have no self-confidence, that I wouldn't even take the steps to accomplish that. Nostalgia sucks. Sometimes I wish I could erase some of my memories or forget some of my dreams entirely.",10,2016-03-26 05:13:21 EDT-0400
867,Beginning To Have Panic Attacks Whilst Sleeping... Also Having 20-50+ Attacks Per 24 Hours.,"Hello!

So, I've gone from having an average of 10-30 panic attacks a day while waking to having up to 50 in a 24 hour period...  This is because, within the last week, I've started having panic attacks in my sleep.  I am usually (80-90% of the time) NOT dreaming when these happen.  They wake me from my sleep, cause me to run around frantically, beat my fiance awake, and then vomit.

I already have terrible insomnia, and this just makes things worse.  I feel like I'm slowly losing my grip with reality.  It's so disorienting waking up in full panic mode, in the dark, and desperately sick to my stomach...  and it's only been a week, and it's wearing me down already.  I can't even find peace when I try to nap during the day if I have the time.  And it's having a kindling effect--I feel like the more I have, especially while asleep, the more severe, prolonged, and frequent they become.

Have any of you experienced this?  Has anything helped?  I'll even consider additional meds...  This is unbearable.  I took 10 mg Ambien last night to help me calm down, but in the wee hours in the morning after it wore off, the panic jolted me awake again for several hours.  Self-harm is the only way I can snap myself out of panic attacks, especially if I'm alone.  I look terribly gnarly right now.

I'm beyond frustrated already...  I'm having up to freaking FIFTY panic attacks in 24 hours.  This is ridiculous.  I'm still going about my daily life fairly normally, but this is really putting a strain on my life in every aspect.  ""Distressed"" is the only word I can think of to describe how I feel.

What do I do?

- i took up swimming lessons, but i only made it to a few classes before the super self conscious side of me won the battle and i stopped going ( its not like I said much anyway , in reality I was  just a very quite & skinny guy struggling to move in the water )

- After that i took up jogging , which helped a bit  until my mind won out again ( i'd see people in pairs or groups out jogging as well and think to myself "" here you are , once again,  all alone"" )

  - i've stopped getting invites to go places because i would almost always turn them down , simply because that place is too crowded and i'd just spend the night feeling awkward and weak  

- the support group i go to is just a bi-weekly gig, no one there really suggests anything extra ( to be fair it takes most of us the first hour of the meeting before we can hold a conversation that lasts longer than 5 minutes ) and the chances of me suggesting something are non-existent 



I have this huge fear that this feeling is never going to end , this is me for the rest of my life but i just lack the basic strength to change anything ",11,2016-04-05 21:06:10 EDT-0400

I ended up having multiple panic attacks and decided it wasn't going to work out. It was a huge blow to my self esteem. I was lucky though because I was able to transfer into a similar program that fits my needs much better. For a few days, I was doing good. Everything on paper worked out but yet I was still miserable. This is when I knew I had a problem. My mind was constantly racing and ripping apart my sanity. Last night was bad though. I woke up this morning feeling sick to my stomach. I was physically tired and felt like I wanted to throw up. Enough was enough. I called and made an appointment with our school counselor and I feel good. I look forward to starting this journey of fixing whats broken. I wanted to be strong and I thought that meant sucking it up but that didn't work. Sometimes we need to accept we have problems and we need help from others.

I've done very minor ""work experience"" related things but my anxiety took over and I screwed up both of them. This is only my first shift but I think this time things are different. I felt like I was actually being inducted properly and they were actively expecting me to make mistakes since there's a lot of things to learn and remember. So I spent the shift just trying to learn and take in as much as I could and help out where I could.

922,A song I think perfectly describes a panic attack [trigger warning],"It's called panic attack by Dream Theater. I've loved this song since I got into metal, but I hadn't listened to it in years. After 2 panic attacks I thought about it and gave it another  listen and it kinda blew me away how accurate it was in regards to an actual panic attack and anxiety. Besides the explanation through lyrics the overall tone of the song is frantic and kinda embodies the actual feeling of an attack, but that might just be me. I'd think a song about a panic attack would be undesirable to someone who suffers them but besides the fact that it's one of my favorite songs, it being so relatable is comforting to me and I'm glad there's a song that accurately portrays something real that people suffer from. 

Anyway here's the song I'm talking about : https://youtu.be/5hDs6mCVAKs

And the lyrics if you can't listen :

All wound up

On the edge

Terrified


Sleep disturbed

Restless mind

Petrified



Bouts of fear

Permeate

All I see


Heightening

Nervousness

Threatens me


I am paralyzed

So afraid to die

Caught off guard

Warning signs

Never show


Tension strikes

Choking me

Worries grow


Why do I feel so numb

Is it something to do with where I come from

Should this be fight or flight

I don't know why I'm constantly so uptight


Rapid heartbeat pounding through my chest

Agitated body in distress

I feel like I'm in danger

Daily life is strangled by my stress


A stifling surge
Shooting through all my veins
Extreme apprehension
Suddenly I'm insane


Lost all hope for redemption

A grave situation desperate at best


Why do I feel so numb

Is it something to do with where I come from

Should this be fight or flight

I don't know why I'm constantly reeling


Helpless hysteria

A false sense of urgency

Trapped in my phobia

Possessed by anxiety


Run

Try to hide

Overwhelmed by this complex delirium


I hope this is okay for this sub, sorry for kinda rambling I just thought I'd share. But I wasn't sure if the content of the song might be upsetting to some so I put a tw just in case. ",4,2016-09-17 01:06:58 EDT-0400

After a week of mustering up the courage to go by myself, I finally drove to the theater tonight. My hands were shaking as I used the touchscreen to buy my ticket from the automated ticket dispenser, but after a deep breath, I managed to click ""confirm"". 

I actually came at a pretty bad time, because the theater was absolutely packed with kids and parents. As a 22 year old male, I stuck out like a sore thumb. Thankfully, the lights were low when I walked in, so nobody even gave me a second glance. 

Get this! Since most of the seats were taken, I had to take a seat at the very front! I was extremely self conscious for the first 5 minutes, as I imagined everyone staring at the weirdo without kids who came by himself. As the first trailers started to play, I calmed down a lot, and from then on, it was easy to relax and enjoy the movie. I even laughed along with the rest of the audience during the movie's funny moments.

This can be anything from putting of school work/opening important emails/dealing with 'serious' things, to silly things like opening texts from friends & replying to them/returning phonecalls etc that don't even feel 'scary' to me at the time. Sometimes this leads to fairly big problems or at least completely avoidable problems that weren't an issue until I'd procrastinated them, or just to things like people getting frustrated with me or me feeling guilty because I take days to reply to people who have just said hi or are being friendly and making an effort to contact me. I don't know if this is somehow related to anxiety and my brain just not wanting to deal with anything til it has to (fyi I have varying levels of anxiety pretty much constantly about a lot of stuff so the procrastination isn't my only 'symptom') or whether I'm just lazy and wanting an excuse to make myself feel better...does anyone else get this?

Anxiety of travel makes the ocean a little duller. Anxiety from caffeine overdose destroys the calm that is supposed to come with enjoying a cup of tea. Anxiety makes me worry that my cat might get hurt. Anxiety tells me that I'll get bitten or stung by a bug, landing me in the hospital if I go on a hike. Anxiety hurts my karate performance, because I'm supposed to have confidence and it shows when I don't. Anxiety makes me fear that everything I draw is ugly.

941,I[F20] managed to get up and get a job today.,"So, I woke up this morning from a phone call from my best friend. She was crying and said that her roommate was breaking the lease and she felt pressured into signing(she also has anxiety). 

Reddit, I have been sulking around since the semester ended. I clean around my parents house and try to do things but I always feel empty by the end of the day (I also have recurrent depression). 

Anyway, I digress. I got up, got ready, and went to comfort her. I saw that her problem could be fixed by a new roommate. 

I made a call to my sister, who also has anxiety and was job hunting today, asked her if she was still interested in working at a doggy day care that an old friend of mine owns and we applied together. I went home, made a phone call to the old friend(this was hard as I panic over phone calls). She hired my sister and I as soon as I told her we applied. I know, it's kind of cheating to know the owner, but this was huge for me. 

As soon as I got home, I told my mom. She flipped her shit. She was not okay with me getting a job and preparing to save up to find an apartment with a friend. I should point out, I sat down and did some budgeting and found that I could totally live in an apartment with a roommate(it's Tulsa, cheap rent), we're just going to wait a few months, save money and find a new place. 

No one said congratulations or anything. It just happened quickly and I was getting yelled at by the person who I expected to support me.

Eventually, I told my best friend, who took the time to say she was really proud of me. 

It feels like everyone else is being cautious and waiting for me to ruin this. I just wanted to get this off my chest. My parents have always fully supported my brothers, who are all older and struggling through life (except one, he's amazing but my parents don't talk to him because he came out years ago. I talk to him every other day). My sister and I always get criticized. 

I can't stand it here anymore. I'm saving up and moving to another state (I'm looking at you, Colorado). My family is absolutely toxic. I can never imagine myself coming out to them or telling them I'm not religious. 

Today was a big day for me and they were completely awful. I'm so excited for this new job. I feel like this is a great step and actually have some energy to go out today. I actually fought my anxiety today and felt like a different person. I smiled at strangers instead of looking at my feet. I even managed to accept a dinner invitation and go out with another friend.

943,"After a long time battling with anxiety, here's how I'm finally beating it.","**My Experience with Anxiety**

Anxiety runs in my family. My dad has always had an anxious side to him, and, growing up, I always dealt with social anxiety, fear of public speaking and humiliation, fear of the future, intrusive thoughts about death of myself and those I love, and more. I had always been able to manage it until last year.

In December of 2015, I suffered a really bad panic attack that sent me to the ER in an ambulance. It was the scariest moment in my life. I truly thought that I was dying from a heart attack. I spent a couple of hours in the ER, but was eventually calmed down and sent home. Following this event, I suffered through a couple months of awful anxiety. I had continued panic attacks and terrible symptoms (you can read about some of my experiences in my previous posts [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/howtonotgiveafuck/comments/4anzt1/if_you_live_in_a_state_of_constant_worry_your/), [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/4c1zx1/the_irony_of_anxiety_and_the_vicious_cycle_that/), and [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/4bhuly/looking_for_help_in_dealing_with_health_anxiety/)).

My anxiety took over my life completely. I had a hard time functioning on a day-to-day basis, even during normal tasks such as going to work, making breakfast, and sitting on the couch watching TV. It was like having this creature on my back at all times, pestering me with thoughts of my health, life and death, my past, my future, etc. This went on for roughly five or six months or so.

**The Symptoms**

Before I had that first panic attack, my anxiety had always just been a subtle fear of the world around me; it had never been physical. Following the panic attack, it became incredibly physical. Here's a list of some of the various symptoms that I experienced during the worst of it:

* Sensations in my forehead and chest
* Heart palpitations
* Sensitivity to my heart rate
* Insomnia (this was one of the worst and I discuss it [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/4ruf1o/anxiety_and_insomnia/) and [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/sleep/comments/4sayq5/how_to_deal_with_pseudoinsomnia/))
* Stomach aches and cramps
* Diarrhea
* Dizziness
* Light-headedness
* Tightness in my throat
* Chronic cough

With each of these symptoms came incredible fear. They all appeared out of nowhere and with each one, I found myself panicking.

**What I Tried**

I took a lot of different approaches to try to relieve the anxiety that had taken over my life. Some of these approaches brought relief, but ultimately, none of them tackled the anxiety at the source.

*Xanax:* This was my crutch. For months, I was on and off the drug, which was a huge mistake. I had become so dependent upon Xanax that it made recovery incredibly difficult. Xanax only helps you manage anxiety, it cures nothing. Taking a Xanax made me feel normal again...until it wore off. Then the anxiety would come rushing back and usually, it would be more intense than before. For more on my Xanax experiences, see [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/4huo9e/xanax_withdrawalmisuse_leading_to_insomnia/) and [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/4md05n/withdrawal_is_very_real_and_its_something_that/).

*Doctors:* As much as I respect doctors and all of the good that they do for the world, anxiety is not their forte. I can't even begin to count the number of doctors that I saw for all of the various symptoms that I experienced. Doctors take a look at physical symptoms and try to determine which medications will help relieve those symptoms. I was told that I had bronchitis, whooping cough, low blood sugar, and (the best of all) nothing wrong at all! I don't think I had a single doctor consider that it might be my anxiety that was causing so many physical symptoms. Please see my advice below for how to utilize your doctor for anxiety.

*Therapy:* I saw a therapist for a couple of weeks. While she helped with some of the underlying causes of the anxiety, it was ultimately just a talk and listen session each time. I would leave each session feeling a bit of relief, but after a day or two, the symptoms would come rushing back. Please see my advice below for how to utilize therapists.

*Family and Friends:* I felt the most amount of comfort throughout all of this when I was surrounded by family and friends. Having other people around me made me feel safe. As soon as I was on my own again, the symptoms would come rushing back.

**What Worked**

All of the events that unfolded during my bout of anxiety have been necessary for me to reach the place that I am at now. I needed to work through it. I needed to experience the lowest of lows and seek out all of the potential solutions. They've lead me down a path to recovery and, from where I am now, I feel more prepared to take on my life than ever before.

Ultimately, it was a book that helped me the most. I recently read [DARE](http://dareresponse.com/) by Barry McDonagh, and it has given me understanding and acceptance like nothing else. Here's why: *recovery from anxiety can only come from yourself through acceptance, rather than resistance.* For months, I fought and fought with my thoughts and my symptoms. I was frustrated over my struggles. I perpetuated how terrible I was feeling by fighting it at every step of the way.

Without trying to reduce the process too much, once you understand what anxiety is, the symptoms that it can cause, and that it's your behavior that's producing the stress response within your system, you can begin to heal. In reality, anxiety is simply a mixture of hormones and chemicals that are produced by your body in response to situations that it thinks are dangerous. When you're not in any real danger yet you continue to feel high levels of energy and awareness, you're experiencing anxiety. How you respond to these high levels of energy will determine how anxious you will feel. *Anxiety is an attack on your confidence. You will not begin to feel better until you begin to feel confident again.*

**Some Advice**

If you're living with anxiety, it's okay. A quote from Lord of the Rings stands out to me the most now that I'm beginning to get to the other side of this challenge:

> Full of darkness and danger they were, and sometimes you didn't want to know the end because how could the end be happy? How could the world go back to the way it was when so much bad had happened? But in the end it's only a passing thing this shadow, even darkness must pass. A new day will come, and when the sun shines it'll shine out the clearer. 

During the worst moments that you'll experience with anxiety, keep pushing onward. Understand that, as much as it seems like it will never end, it will! Here's some of the points of advice that I offer to you based upon my experiences:

* In the midst of your anxiety, avoid caffeine and alcohol. These will only make you feel worse, trust me! Once you get through the anxiety, you can return to them safely.
* Medications like Xanax, Celexa, and Prozac WILL NOT cure your anxiety; they will only calm you down temporarily. You should use them in moderation, but avoid using them as a crutch.
* Always see your doctor first. Have your doctor rule out any major health issues. DO NOT EXPECT THEM TO BE THE END ALL BE ALL FOR YOUR ANXIETY. Once they clear you of any major health issues, check that off your list of concerns.
* If you'd like to see a therapist, find one that understands anxiety. If the therapist is not well-versed in the symptoms and source of anxiety, he or she will not be able to help you reach recovery.
* Ensure that you're able to get enough sleep each night. Insomnia was a killer for me. I had to reinvent my sleep routine in order to even get any sleep each night. I had periods of several days to a week during which I didn't sleep at all. When you're sleep deprived, your body cannot heal and your mind will be operating at a reduced capacity.

If you have any questions, please feel free to ask. I highly recommend finding reading material that will explain anxiety in full. I can only summarize what I've experienced and learned in this post. The main point is this: recovery from anxiety must come from within through the regaining of confidence and an understanding and acceptance of the functions of anxiety. Anxiety comes from your behavior. Change your behavior and you will find peace. Good luck!

EDIT: Typo.

EDIT 2: I just want to clarify a couple of things. 1) I am not a doctor, a psychologist, or a psychiatrist, and I have no credentials in terms of a medical or psychological education. I do not think that I stated anywhere that I do. I only have my own experiences and how I managed to work through my anxiety. 2) I am not trying to sell a book. In fact, I don't care if you read that book or any other book or if, in fact, your recovery is aided with the help of a therapist. Again, I am simply describing what helped me understand my anxiety. 3) I am in no way claiming that doctors or therapists do not know what they're talking about. With that being said, however, doctors are not therapists. They can describe to you, from a biological standpoint, what is occurring in your body, but they are not going to help you understand the source of your anxiety. My doctors filled my medicine cabinet with countless prescription drugs, but none of them helped me get to where I am today. I am 100% positive that therapy helps people - it was just not my particular path and it might not be for everyone.

EDIT 3: Thank you for the gold! I've read some good criticism so far. Everyone has good points. Again, I am simply speaking from my own experiences. I am not trying to promote anything or dismiss anything. I also do not mean to imply that anxiety can be ""beaten"" and that once it's done, it's done. I still suffer from anxiety every single day. Now, however, I know how to respond to it. Rather than running to the bathroom out of fear of hyperventilating and passing out, I am able to recognize it for what it is, accept, and dismiss it. This is what I mean by understanding the link between one's behavior and anxiety itself. Regain your confidence, learn how to recognize and understand anxiety for what it is, and you will find yourself in an amazing place. Your symptoms may come and go, but you will at least be prepared for them.",36,2016-07-22 17:14:11 EDT-0400

He is my whole world and I know I would not be okay without him.

948,"People get annoyed with me because I'll complain about something, but get too anxious to change it.","I know complaints without action is a nasty habit, but it's not for lack of trying. Usually, this has to do with relationships.

If I'm in a bad romantic relationship, my friends will hear me complain for a year or so before I work up the courage to breakup, and even then, exes stay in my life for a long time after because I suck at clean breaks. 

Don't like my boss? I'll grin and bare it, but throw epic rage fits about it around my friends. I don't have the courage to leave the job because while the boss sucks, the job is good and I'm scared of losing it.

Someone is taking advantage of me? My current situation. My friends will get me really pumped up to walk away from the situation, but when the time comes, I can't do it. 

A lot of times, I'm scared I'll regret walking away from something, be it a boyfriend or an opportunity. I also feel terrible when I let people down. I'm a massive people pleaser. Add a smidgen of sunk costs to this equation, and the person I'm trying to walk away from will find some way to convince me to hang around for a bit longer. It's odd that I keep doing this, when all I've ever felt from walking away from these situations is relief. 

My friends eventually get upset with me. I've even lost friends in the past because they'll hear me complain, but then stay in the situation. I usually get to the point that I just don't talk about it anymore because I don't want to lose their friendship.

I'm feeling pretty alone right now, and anxious because of all the things I've agreed to do for this person who's using me. I plan on telling him this weekend that he can't use me as free labor anymore and I fully intend to make a clean break. He's very manipulative and much older than me, though, and I'm a fool falling for his empty promises because I don't want to regret walking away from this, but I'm determined.

I'm looking for a little encouragement from people who understand, and also for others who struggle with the same thing.

Edit: the thing I'm walking away from is a startup. We had some hiccups and I'm not getting paid, which is understandable, but the workload is killing me. Other, older, wiser people have walked away, leaving me to take on the extra work. The person spearheading this has been talking me out of looking for work or going back to school. I can also tell I'm not getting the whole story from him. Things will be brought up that sound promisimg, only not to work out or never be brought up again.",15,2016-07-27 22:56:16 EDT-0400

Deep down, my gut is telling me that I am not able to speak clearly, or speak in ways that are not fluent with that language *(proper grammar, proper comprehension and so on)* but somehow I feel like I end up continuing to speak in inarticulate manner because I feel like I am stuck inside the turmoil of my own head *(both anxiety and depression)*

For example ... A few minutes ago, I said to someone,

""Why are you on bed already"", instead of saying ""in bed""

Small mistakes that make me feel self-aware and scared as well *(perfectionism, I think)* and it has been going on for a while now

*(even right now while I am writing this post, I feel like I am making mistakes and when I finished, I ended up re-reading it to make sure I didn't make any foolish or stupid mistakes.

You can have a really negative interaction with someone, and see in their post history that they're intensely unhappy people, because they spend most of their time fighting with strangers on the internet.

964,I fucked up - finals week,"I have an exam in three hours, and one immediately following that one. I was so determined to do well, I kept pushing and pushing myself. Ive probably dedicated over 30 hours this week to studying. I've gotten 3 hours of sleep everyday since Monday, and at around 3am today and my 4th cup of coffee I realized how much I still did not know. I waited until last minute to study Calculus because I wanted to focus on Biology, and as I looked at the lists and lists of information I didn't know I felt like I was drowning and the walls were closing in on me. I couldn't breath, and I felt so alone and isolated. I rarely cry, but I instantly broke down in panicked sobs and called my mom. I feel delirious from lack of sleep and everything I read makes no sense, even if it did before. I'm lying in bed now, but I know I will not sleep. I feel so incredibly stupid and gross.  I know it's only my first semester of college, but I am just so disappointed and embarrassed. I used adderall for the first time this week for studying, and that makes me feel so disgusting. I didn't even want to mention that but I feel like it's important. I used it three days in a row, and now I feel like the shell of myself. I know the side effects can be periods of feeling ""low"", which was a really stupid fucking decision on my part considering my default setting is already low. 
I just felt like I needed to say this, for myself and for anyone else who is feeling the same way about finals. Test taking is not a testament to your self worth. Take care of yourself and your body above all, don't try to take shortcuts, perform to the best of your abilities and be proud that you gave it your all. Exams are so stressful, especially to those with anxiety, so just by taking them you accomplished so much. Congrats to everyone who had finals this week, you made it.

966,Having anxiety about seeing a doctor for my anxiety...,"I've been nervous and easily stressed all my life. I feel afraid most of the time, even about things that seem silly, like making a phone call. I haven't been diagnosed with anxiety, but I've always assumed this is because my nervousness about doctors has kept me from actually going to the doctor and asking about it. I've had some recent changes in my life that have been motivating me to take positive steps in my life. To that end, I made my first appointment with a therapist, but they had no open dates until February, so it'll be a while before I can go. I've also been considering just putting on my big girl panties and dragging my frightened ass to the doctor to see if they can help me. That said, I have several concerns about going, so I thought I'd post here and see if you all have any thoughts for me. 

1) I'm very functional. My anxiety makes me unhappy often, but I've been dealing with it my whole life and I'm good at handling it. Maybe I'm afraid all the time, but that hasn't stopped me from forming solid relationships, earning my degree, or getting and keeping a job. Is a doctor likely to diagnose me with anxiety if I'm anxious all the time but it doesn't really interfere with my life? I'm terrified that I'll go and they'll tell me there's nothing wrong with me. 

2) I've read up on medication for anxiety and it seems that a lot of it can really decrease your sex drive and that taking most medications for anxiety means you're not allowed to drink. My sexuality is a big part of who I am and I really don't want to lose that. Additionally, I'm really interested in craft beers and ciders, and while I don't drink to excess often, I love having a beer or two while playing board games with my friends. Tasting and trying new beers is a big part of my social life and I don't want to lose that either. Is it worth asking my doctor for medication if there isn't anything that won't interfere with my sex life or my love trying of craft beer? 

Overall, I'm finally willing to go to the doctor about my anxiety if it has the possibility of being a positive step for me. However, I'm terrified of the doctor and it doesn't seem worth putting myself through the stress of going if they're pretty sure not to diagnose me or if there's no medication that won't take away parts of my life that I love. Is it better to just continue dealing with my anxiety until I can get in to see a therapist or should I struggle through the visit to the doctor?",11,2016-12-14 21:54:06 EST-0500

968,Anxiety isn't cute.,"I wish I knew how to explain to people that anxiety isn’t something that you want. It’s not something you just wake up one day and decide to have. It’s not romantic and it’s not cute. It’s fucking scary and it’s absolute, unending, crushing instability that you wish you could rip from yourself. 

I don’t know where people got this insane idea that anxiety is this cute little quirk that makes them more desirable to the opposite sex, but if you really want to have it that badly, take mine. I could do without it for a while. 

People with real anxiety issues don’t tell anyone about the crushing weight that settles on them because they don’t want to seem as if they are one of those people who tries to romanticize the idea of a mental disorder like it’s something that we can fix with a kiss on the forehead and a boyfriend’s hoodie. I would rather pour acid on myself than have people see the panic attacks like the one I had tonight at work. At least then I could scream like I want to and people wouldn’t question it or act like I was crazy.

If you have even an inkling that anxiety is some romantic, adorable thing, I want you to imagine this for a moment: Imagine you are standing in the middle of your work day, doing something as meaningless as sorting clothing. You’re working alone. No one is bothering you, no one is near you. It’s something you do every single day and there is nothing different happening. Suddenly and without warning or reason, the room starts to spin. Your chest gets tight, you feel like you can’t breathe. and your whole body starts to shake. You feel like you’re losing your grip on reality. You can’t calm down and you can’t bring yourself back from the edge. There’s no reason for it. Nothing happened. Nothing. You were thinking about something completely trivial - Christmas and your family holiday. You rush to the restroom, trying to make sure your face doesn’t betray even half of what you are feeling. And in the restroom, you huff and puff and lean against the wall and try with all your might to calm down and stop sweating and stop panicking over absolutely nothing. You try for what feels like hours but is something more like five minutes. And then even though the only thing you’ve succeeded in doing is straightening your clothes and making the room stop spinning, you have to go back to your work, even with a heavy chest and ringing in your ears, because if you stay gone too long, someone will know you’re crazy or think you’re wasting time. 

Do you really want this? Do you really want this to be your reality every day? Because this is what I go through. This was my night at work. This is what people with real and lasting anxiety issues go through every single day of their lives. 

You can try to romanticize something as hellish as someone’s every day demise. You can try to make yourself seem adorable by acting awkward and shy when you really aren’t. But for God’s sake don’t wish for something that real people everywhere would set themselves on fire to get rid of every single day. Don’t ask to have something that envelopes people in complete nothingness for hours, days, weeks on end, something that takes years of medication and therapy and conditioning just to control. 

And if you do suffer from this hellish misery, please know that you aren’t alone and there are others who struggle with this every day. You aren’t crazy. You aren’t a baby. It’s real and it’s there. I am sorry you are dealing with this plight. You are stronger than this and you will make it through. I promise.  ",17,2016-12-19 05:34:49 EST-0500

(Do know my eyes are sensitive as well. Still feel awful about how much of a hassle I put eye wear people through during those god awful ""poof"" tests.)

Heck in the animal kingdom it is a no no and a sign of challenge. Strange how it works with humans. (window of the soul or some nonsense) On that note I have no problems with doing so with animals (even enjoying the exchange) and find I get along with them super easily to the surprise of people around me.",21,2016-12-17 22:05:41 EST-0500

976,Does anyone else have such bad anxiety it makes you feel physically sick?,"Every morning I wake up way earlier than I should, around six or seven. And every morning I feel on the urge of throwing up because of how bad my anxiety gets. The shitty thing is that there's really nothing to cause this. It's just a normal day and I am not obligated to go out in public or do anything, really. Unless I have to work, but my job doesn't give me anxiety. I love my job. This has been happening since March, when my boyfriend of three years and I were in the process of breaking up and moving out. I've accepted that I just can't be with him, and I've moved on. I have a wonderful partner now that treats me very well, and comforts me and kisses me to no end every single morning, but it doesn't help. The only thing I can do that helps is go outside and smoke a bowl. It makes me super tired, so it's easier to fall back asleep. By the time I wake up the second time around, I usually feel fine. 

I don't know what to do, but it's getting really old. Halp. ",147,2016-09-14 21:07:30 EDT-0400
977,My whole life just got flipped upside down,"It all started on a Monday; of course... I had just drove to university and I got a call from my mom, I think ""she knows I have class this must be important"" when I answered she was balling. She told me about a text she had just received, a screen shot actually. A sum oh hundreds of messages and dirty pictures from my dads mistress. This was so unexpected- my parents had always been known to be the perfect married couple, envied by my friends and family members. My mom is heart broken, my dad has lost his mind. I spent yesterday changing the locks on the house for my mom and packing my dads shit, consoling my mother and trying not to think of myself but WAIT-THERES MORE. I wake up at 6 this morning not being able to sleep and look for my dog, not being able to find him I go out back and there he is; dead. He choked on something he found outside and died- covered in ants and just a gruesome sight I had to take him and clean him up and take his body to the nearest vet. After that I proceeded to go check on my dad and had to cradle him after multiple breakdowns- this is an old military man- a man I've rarely seen cry in my life. Idk man, idk. I don't if I'm losing my mind, idk what's going on. I feel so betrayed, I'm not a religious man but if there's a God i beg him to just make this calm down. I'm already a pretty anxious person and I also have IBS so I've been pretty miserable but no one knows. I have to be strong- what happens if I fall apart, what will happen to my parents. I'm literally in between a rock and a hard place. I just had to post this somewhere, I had to just write it down.",37,2016-09-14 05:38:16 EDT-0400

980,I hate those days where you don't accomplish anything because you can't stop thinking about something silly,"Yesterday i had my first web development class in my University, i am currently studying computer science, the class is basically an introduction and the teacher asks us to do a few things in the code he sent to our email. It's really basic stuff but i am able to fuck up the ctrl c ctrl v he asked us to do and now nothing works. I get home and asked for a friend of my to sent me the source code file so i can look up what i got wrong, but every minute after i send the message it was like torture, i coudn't stop thinking about wtf was wrong.See here that i knew nothing about web development so it was very fucking normal to not know what was wrong, but my brain decided that was a huge problem and i couldn't rest until i solved it.

After 5h of walking around the house thinking, reading and trying to fix what i knew nothing about, my friend sends me the code and i spent half an hour reading and learning what was going on there, after that i could finally rest.

982,"I started a round of SSRI's and therapy 7 months ago. my therapy has ended and i've finished my meds, and life is finally great again.","I don't quiet know why I'm writing this. I hope this isn't seen as a self-serving post. I only hope that my experience with mental health and how I've overcome anxiety can help others.

Context - I live in Christchurch, New Zealand. We had two major earthquakes, one in September 2010 and a more devastating one in February 2011. I could write a book about my experiences post-earthquake but in short, these events triggered what would eventually turn into a meltdown in June 2012. I was one of many people in my city who'd been silently trying to cope with PTSD without even knowing, until finally everything all fell a part. This was when I first sought help for Depression, Panic Attacks and Anxiety. My doctor referred me to a counselor, and around the same time I made some big life changes (I was really unhappy with where I was with my life, which contributed to my depression). I learned coping mechanisms to manage my anxiety and afterwards, everything was fine for a long time.

Fast forward to about February this year, and I could feel my anxiety coming back, and it was becoming harder to control. There was no depression this time, no major panic attacks (although I had to fight to control one or two of them from starting), I just had high levels of anxiety. I went back to the doctor and admitted I could no longer help myself and I needed help again. 

I was put on 20mg of Citalopram a day, and referred to a therapist. The meds helped a lot with the immediate symptoms of anxiety, but things really made a turn for the better after the therapy. I had 5 sessions with this therapist which ended in July this year. I learned so much from her which has helped tremendously, but I honestly don't believe it would have been possible without the SSRI's as a safety net. 6 weeks ago I started tapering off my meds, and today is my second day with no medication.

It's such a relief to have reached this point. If there's anything I can offer anyone else it's the following:

*  Anxiety may never fully go away. It's ok to go back and seek additional help if you're finding things tough again. This is the second time I've had to seek professional help for mental health, and I hope it's a last - but I've promised myself not to hesitate if I need to seek help again. I think everyone can do themselves a favour by not hesitating when things are getting tough.
* Find the doctor that's right for you. It's ok to shop around to find one that's experienced with mental health issues and can prescribe you with the right meds and refer you to the right therapists. 
* I was terrified to go on SSRI's because like many, I'd read the horror stories on the internet about their side-effects. Just remember, the internet is full of confirmation bias. People are only ever going to post on forums about the bad experiences, and rarely the good ones. There's also a lot of taboo and misinformation around the subject of anti-depressant/anxiety meds - I experienced this with my immediate family, so I just don't talk to them about it. A lot of people won't always understand, but they don't have to. Do what's right for you and your health. This actually applies to most things in life I guess!
* The first two weeks on Citalopram sucked. Big time. I don't want to scare anyone, but I feel I have to be honest on this point. The saying is so true though, SSRI's make things worse before they make things better. I'm lucky to have an incredibly supportive partner who helped me through this stage. All I can say is keep reminding yourself that this is only temporary. It may be tough, and you may be tempted to stop, but if you stay on the meds, push through the first few weeks and remind yourself ""it's going to be ok"", you'll feel so much better when the meds start doing what they're meant to do. After the first few weeks were over, I had a few side effects but they were no more than an occasional nuisance. 
* Citalopram wasn't a magic pill that made everything lovely. It did however make my anxiety so much easier to handle. I was no longer constantly on edge and feeling like I was about to throw up. 
* I think I'd probably still be on the meds if it wasn't for my therapist. All I can say is CBT (Cognitive Behavioral Therapy) is the bomb! The meds helped bring my anxiety down to a manageable level in the short term, so I could start to function as a normal human being and take advantage of the therapy. CBT gave me the tools to manage my anxiety in the long term, and taught me how to recognise anxious thoughts and manage them before they turned into obsessive thought patterns. If you're refereed to a therapist, I highly recommend you find one who's trained in CBT. It's made the world of difference. 
* When/if you decide to come of your meds, make sure you taper off, and over a decent period of time. Coming straight off them ""cold turkey"" is a huge shock to the system, and had I done that I assume It would probably have resulted in my anxiety returning. Each morning when I'd reduce my dose, the day that would follow would normally be a little more tough. It feels like the return of anxiety, but it's just the effects of the drugs coming out of your system. SSRI's take time to build up in your body before they take effect, hence why the first few weeks suck. Tapering off them is basically the reverse of that, so as the level of the SSRI reduces in your system, those effects will present themselves. When I would reduce my meds these effects would only last a day or less however, and then I'd be back to normal. Again, just remind yourself ""it's going to be ok"". 

If anyone has any questions feel free to ask. I don't know if this can be of any help to anyone, but I would be thrilled if something good did come out of this for someone. New Zealand has a pretty poor track record when it comes to Mental Health services, so I feel pretty motivated to share information if I can. 

To end, I guess all I can say is, it's going to be ok. If there's anything I've learned, it's that there's been so many times where I thought a situation was only going to end in disaster, and I would obsess over the worst possible outcome. Disaster hasn't struck yet, and it's likely it never will, so that helps me breathe easy. I hope you can breathe easy as well :) ",23,2016-09-08 05:02:13 EDT-0400

a lot of this stems from anxiety issues and keeping to myself indoor only leaving for uni, but lately i find myself more and more depressed about getting older, in my mind i have fantasies about eventually achieving all these things ( though i'm worried about never achieving them also) , but i'm constantly worried that maybe i have missed out on living my youth completely, i won't be able to tell anyone my younger years were good, i'm going to have to explain to people i meet why i'm so unaccomplished and inexperienced for my age, i already look at younger people having a better time than me and feel so envious that i never gave myself the chance to or that they are far more comfortable when interacting with people than i ever was, can't imagine how much worse this feeling might be 10-20 years from now. I find myself constantly wishing i was 5 or 10 yrs younger, noone really associates 26 with youth as much as they do 21 of 16, i'm depressed i'll never get to feel undeniably young ever again, the thought of getting to 26 this quickly never crossed my mind 5 years ago, yet here i am already and unprepared, with less life experiences than some people a decade younger than me.",22,2016-09-11 21:56:00 EDT-0400

991,Today anxiety won the battle but lost the war,"Had an opportunity to get a job I really *really* wanted. Have outright bailed on about 4 jobs in the past year due to anxiety. Good jobs too. No idea how I keep getting these.

There was an ""group training instruction"" tonight. It was unclear from the e-mail whether or not this was mandatory for the core aspects of the job. Was it for people who were instructing groups, or was it us being instructed in a group!? Anxiety began yesterday afternoon. Stayed up almost all night. Paralyzed in the morning. There was no way this was going to happen.

I'm fortunate enough to have *some* skills in my black toolbox - it's black so the red cross stands out. So I can find it more easily when I need it. Enter damage control mode.

I choose honesty, as I usually do when anxiety is trying to dictate my life. I send a short very straight forward e-mail. I say ""I have a personal emergency and I'm not going to be able to make it"". I say that ""I understand it's a training session, so please let me know where that leaves me.""

Ten minutes later an e-mail blips on my phone. I debate not reading it. I think most times I wouldn't dare until hours later. Turns out it's in fact, for people who were going to be instructing in groups. This wasn't really going to be a part of my job anyways as I understood it. I'm not fired. I may not have the best start, but I have a chance.

992,FINAL UPDATE: I am a 21 year old with a driving phobia. 2 days ago I got my licence. Tips on how to overcome driving test fears,"**a little note here to the mods. I am posting this in anxiety because my doctor thinks GAD is highly related to my phobia :) just so you know Im staying relevant to the sub.

Ok....Im done posting here about this for now. Sorry Ive been posting a lot about me driving (should I say sorry?) its just that this has been super super stressful to me and I wanted to vent to people who would understand.

**BACKGROUND**

So, here are my 2 major previous posts about my journey leading up to this point...or just go to my submission history and youll see everything, I posted a lot around reddit a few more times about this whole issue (reddit is basically my venting space lol). But here are the posts that really matter. 

[original post- short, just asking people to wish me luck](https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/4y96lt/im_21_years_old_and_tomorrow_i_am_going_to_face/)

[update post. failed the test. long post, mostly because I saturated it with tips to help the many people I saw on this sub who were struggling with taking the driving test too. Good read for anyone who needs help.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/4yh3v4/update_i_am_21_years_old_and_i_have_a_driving/)

**Ok, now to the actual update and tips**

So many of you guys shared my struggle that I just wanted yall to know its possible to get through this. Im serious. Seldom did I EVER think I would get my licence in my entire life because I was so fucking scared of driving. I really cant stress that enough.

But I still did it. I really, really did it. And when that examiner told me I passed I cried tears of joy right in front of him and shook his hand.

So I just wanted to give yall a few final tips on how to get your licence when it feels like driving is so scary that its basically life or death every time you get on the road in your mind- or if youre horrified of messing up or getting lost, or embarrassing yourself.

This is an extension of my second major post, so read that if you want more tips :)

**When you get to your test its ok to tell your examiner that you have anxiety or a driving phobia that you are trying to overcome**. It really is. It can benefit you a lot to open up to people, even if they are strangers. The first time I took my test my examiner didnt know what was going on with me. She just knew I was incredibly nervous. But on this second test **when I actually told my examiner what was going on with me, he actively worked to help me ease my nerves during the entire test**. He encouraged me and talked to me the entire time, just trying to distract me from my fears. Im not sure which eased me more, his helpful actions, or just knowing that he was really rooting for me and cared about me.

Im not saying there is any guarantee that you will get an examiner as kind and helpful as mine was, but if you just take a chance and tell them that important detail about yourself, I think its worth it. 

**If you show signs of nervousness during the test like shaking or sweating, its ok**. Its distracting to try and *hide* your anxiety. Shaking, sweating, etc, are just expressions of how you feel. You need to be focused on the road. So let your body and voice shake during the test if you have to. Get it out of your system. As long as you can push through then its ok to express yourself. Accept that you are going to be scared and then push on! Sometimes the most debilitating thing about anxiety is that we waste so much energy fighting how we feel that we end up hurting ourselves and putting life to a halt.

**Its only going to feel bad for a little bit**. Just like that feeling before getting on a rollercoaster. Its always so terrifying before you get on the ride, but once you are on it you may not be scared anymore. Truly, the worst part for me was waiting for the test to happen and the beginning of the test. But once I was on the road for a while my fears gradually subsided and I was focused.

**If you fail its ok to be upset. Just remember that failing doesnt really matter**. Seriously, so many people fail their drivers tests. Youre not any kind of special snowflake if you happened to do it too ;) congratulations, it just makes you normal :)

**If you are like me, you might feel SO MUCH BETTER after you have your licence**. I thought my drivers test would just be the beginning of conquering my driving phobia...and who knows, maybe it is. But the strangest thing is happening. I....dont feel scared anymore. At least, right now I dont. Not THAT much. I think that before I took the test I just had a lot of familial pressure on me to progress in life and start driving and it just overwhelmed me. Now that Ive gotten over that hump and can actually adult and not worry about getting ticketed for not having a licence I am about 85% more comfortable about being on the road. So...I really didnt think I would react this way. Maybe you will end up like this too.

So, there you have it! Good luck to all you guys out there. I am really, really rooting for you and I mean that. You can do this. You can.

Once you pass dont be suprised if you need a day to take it all in. Honestly I was in complete shock the rest of the day after I passed my test. It was the weirdest thing. I was so overwhelmed with the *possibilities* granted to me by having a licence. 

So many possibilities....

995,He made me feel ashamed tonight,"I've struggled for awhile with anxiety and a lot of my anxiety is wrapped around my sexuality and sex life. I'm a bisexual 21 year old male. Tonight I was with this guy I've been seeing for a few weeks and we tried to have sex but I was getting anxious so I told him I would rather we didn't and suggested maybe we do something a little lighter. He got in this mood and told me that he was offended I didn't want to have sex with him. We had tried earlier in the week with some mild amount of success but I just wasn't feeling up to it this time. He told me I offended him and we sat in awkward silence. I tried to explain that it was something that stressed me out and apologized but he said ""That isn't something I will ever be able to understand."" Then he did some homework and then asked to leave. I just feel so ashamed. I can't function like everyone else and normally it doesn't get to me like this but right now... I really feel like an outsider. Like I'm not normal. It feels bad. I guess I just wanted to see if anyone else has felt like this and I also just wanted to tell someone. I don't feel comfortable telling my friends about this cause I'm fairly ashamed about it.

998,Crippling social anxiety makes me such an awkward person,"Long story short, I've battled with horrible self esteem issues from a very young age (had horrible acne from age 9-18). I've always been hyper-aware of how I look in other people's eyes. This has lead to multiple eating disorders and a huge anxiety problem stemming from social contact. The only time when I feel like I am my true self is when I'm at home alone. Other than that, I feel like I must put on a show for other people, and I'm kinda paranoid that everyone is watching me and passing judgements (too fat, big nose, lame clothes), so I am constantly monitoring my body posture and keeping myself very tense. I don't know what I think will happen if I simply relax and just be myself fully. I'm actually a really weird and cool person when I get past my shy barrier. Over time this feeling has gotten a lot better, but I'm starting school at a new college and desperately want to make new friends and connect with others on a deeper level. Because of all these anxious and paranoid thoughts, I've spent the last six months with minimal human contact. I don't feel like I could handle going out and meeting new people who may think I'm not good enough. I'm so fed up with being socially awkward because of these unfounded beliefs and I'm tired of always trying to be something that I'm simply not. Getting pretty sick of holding back my awesomeness. I want to have a life filled with meaningful relationships. So my questions for everyone: Do you suffer from social anxiety? If so, what has your experience with it been like and in what ways does it hold you back? Any stories of success with overcoming social anxiety? I guess right now I just want to feel like I'm not alone. ",16,2016-09-09 19:43:15 EDT-0400

Would definitely recommend something like that because my confidence is getting a lot better.

Anyway I'm 20 and in a state of mind of 'just try it'! The barmaid that served me was nice, so why not ask her out or give her my number. How do I ask someone out I've never really spoken to? I decided I'd write her a limerick. So I come up with a limerick that reads:

I came for the quiz and nothing more,
Amazed to see you when I came through the door,
I write this shit rhyme,
With the hope of getting your time,
And hopefully maybe i'll score.
(then a wink face and my number)

Quite happy with that, thought it's a bit cheeky and it really is my style (would love feedback on the limerick haha)

I handed this to her when her shift finished in front of all her friends, I said ""I think you've dropped something,"" Smiled and went before she read it. Had nothing on my phone so I'm pretty sure it's a no.

Even though I'm 99% sure she rejected me I'm really quite happy! I did something that really worried and scared me, especially because it was in front of  5 of her friends. 

I just wanted to share this because I'm proud and I hope it can show people that it's worth trying even if you get rejected!

1010,I will never get used to the post-anxiety Fatigue.,"So lately I feel I've had it under control, but I think in actuality I've just been avoiding triggers. I've been driving (a big trigger) but only to the necessities, I've been with friends and the social side is gone. But today I tried to put it all together and realized, no, no I'm not better. A fairly long trip in a car (45 minutes as a passenger, but still very panic inducing on the freeway) and four hours with friends. Around midway through it hit me like a wall. I was well rested but suddenly could barely keep my eyes open and felt like I had to lay down. I made it through the social event and survived the car trip home, but the rest of the afternoon/night I was like a zombie. Its not even tiredness, its worse than tiredness, its feeling utterly demolished. Like you can barely get the energy to get up and eat.

I'm unemployed at the moment (largely thanks to the anxiety) but I don't know how people make it through a work day like this. The only time I've ever felt that tired was when I went to work after 0 hours sleep after a night out a few years ago.",15,2016-06-17 13:34:29 EDT-0400
1011,"CBT is changing my life, and it could change yours too.","Hi all

I (23 M) have struggled with panic disorder and moderate depression for 2-3 years now; nearly daily panic attacks, constant blues, feelings of doom and hopelessness. I was medicated for a year which worked pretty well, but I personally just don't view meds as a permanent option.

I started Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) about 7 months ago, and it is changing my life. For those who don't know what CBT is, essentially it's a form of therapy that treats mental disorders holistically by looking at your thought patterns and learning to challenge your cognitions. The idea is that there is a feedback loop between your thoughts, your emotions (anxiety, sadness, obsession, etc) and your behavior, and if you're able to alter your interpretation of your thoughts then you can alter how you feel. 

As an engineer and an analytical thinker, I was fairly skeptical about this approach. I was under the assumption that your cognitions are deeply embedded in your DNA and could not be altered. Well after 7 months of learning about all of my subconscious self-critical / self-esteem killing / perfectionism / judgmental thoughts and learned how to challenge those thoughts, I can tell you that it does work, and it works really well. It doesn't happen overnight, and it's not always easy, but please if you are struggling in any way with anxiety / depression, try out CBT. I've been down the road of panic attacks, self-doubt, self-criticism, hopelessness, and the scariest of all: suicidal thoughts, and I know how much it fucking sucks. Believe me, I do. But I also know that there is always hope, and there is always help. We're not alone, and I hope this reaches somebody in need.

1012,"I dont stress eat, I stress starve","Nothing. I want to eat nothing. I've had this problem l, a year ago I was 98) before but I was doing so good. This last semester of school I was so happy, wasn't taking my Xanax, had only like 3-4 panic attacks, was getting good grades, wasn't fighting with SO, hit my high weight of 115 (I'm 5'8 and 115 was a dream for me)

Then summer happened. I'm doing that gasping thing all day everyday. If I'm not with my SO, I won't sleep until 3 and I'll wake up at 7-8. I've already lost like 4-5 pounds. Sometimes I will go 2-3 days not even realizing I haven't eaten. I won't notice until I get light headed whenever I stand or cramps because my stomach is so tight. Even when my stomach tightens, I feel nothing when I look at food.

Nothing is appealing. The more anxious I am the less I eat, the more anxious I am. I try to shove stuff down but I have a hard time swallowing.

I miss being heavier. when I was like 18, I was like 125. I felt so healthy and looooved my body. I hate it now. I miss my boobs. I feel disgusted when I look in the mirror. And still I can't eat. 

I started trying to bulk through exercise and to burn off excess anxiety but that works for all of 30 minutes until I can't breathe again. 

I'm in therapy but that does nothing... I have no one else to talk too.... I feel like I'm just going to waste away ",34,2016-06-16 06:59:56 EDT-0400

1017,Anxiety has gotten so bad I just threw up in Public,"Sorry to post this from a new account, though I don't intend it to be a throwaway.

A lot has been happening in my life the past few weeks, though nothing that is particularly harrowing, however my anxiety is almost at it's peak (the only time it's been worse is during opiate withdrawal) and whilst I normally get nausea in the mornings and sometimes throw up, it's usually at home before I leave the house.

Generally I feel better once I'm out, though still nowhere near 100%. However, today I was on the tram and suddenly out of nowhere the nausea starts up again... I'm in between stops and I don't have anything in my work bag that might help. I try to hold it down and manage to succeed for about 15 seconds but them my stomach contracts hard and out it comes all over my lap, workbag, and the seating either side of me.

Luckily there were ladies near me that were nice enough to give me some tissues and wet wipes to get cleaned up, nonetheless it felt absolutely horrible and I'm still mortified... All I could do is sit there sweating and wiping my mess up (sounds like the end of a porno, unfortunately the reality is far from it)... the combination of throwing up, the humidity, and anxiety made me sweat like a talking muffin in an oven.

Thanks anxiety, way to give me my most embarrassing moment ever, even worse than trying to kiss my teacher in the 5th grade.  

I gotta do something about this shit but psychs and psych meds are too expensive here, and the ones I used in the past didn't help at all (lexapro and pristiq). Shelling out $1000 USD a month for something that never helped just doesn't seem to make sense. 

Am feeling a bit trapped and I have no idea what to do to beat this shit. It seems like the only thing that helps is rest. I don't really get panic attacks per se, so breathing techniques don't seem to help, nor does anything else I've tried such as meditation. Unfortunately, life is life and I need to work everyday, so rest isn't really possible most of the time.

I don't really have a question or anything, I just needed to get what happened today off my chest. If anyone has any advice it is very welcome. Thanks for letting me vent. ",16,2016-06-16 05:26:10 EDT-0400
1018,I made it through a blood test on my own today,"I just wanted to share my success from today with all of you.

I know why it happened (didn't eat enough beforehand and my blood sugar plummeted) and that nothing bad will happen again, but my brain still goes ""OH MY GOD PANIC"" whenever I have to get a shot or blood drawn. I cry, get dizzy, shake, the whole deal. It's been getting better, but slowly.

Today I went in for my physical, and my doctor told me we needed to do a routine blood test. I wasn't expecting it, and I was by myself (whenever I need to get blood drawn I bring someone with me). But I went down to the lab, told the technician about my anxiety, and got through it. The tech was really nice, too; he kept telling me I was doing great and there was nothing to worry about. I cried a little, but not much, and I walked out of that office feeling like a superhero. It was amazing.",7,2016-06-17 09:15:13 EDT-0400

This time I got staph infection and while the big spot is going away (almost completely gone) due to the antibiotics I was on, I noticed two lumps that formed under my skin on both my wrists. I don't know if that could be staph or not, they feel like cysts maybe? They aren't sore. But this is the main source of my anxiety right now. Thinking I have staph and that I'm going to die from it somehow. Or that I have something worse. I could have a headache and think I'm having an aneurysm. I literally lay in bed all day because my anxiety is too bad to be able to function. Sometimes I get such bad panic attacks while I'm driving that I have to pull over. They wake me up out of a dead sleep so I haven't been sleeping good either. I also get nausea from my anxiety so I don't eat good, either. The only time I feel okay is when I take about 4 mg of Xanax, then I feel so normal and comfortable and able to function. That may seem like a high dose but I have developed a tolerance. The only thing is, I run out so fast because I only get 30 a month. I'm going to talk to my doctor about bumping my script up. Also I make sure not to take them daily so I don't become physically dependent on them because I know the withdrawal from that is a bitch and dangerous. I'm on 2 mg of Abilify too which I feel does nothing. I just feel like I'm going to die any day now. Ugh at this point I'm just rambling, I just had to get all this off my chest. My friend said go to the doctor and tell him everything you think is wrong and you'll feel better but I'm too anxious to even do that... thanks for reading. ",7,2016-06-20 22:18:07 EDT-0400

1022,"I hate being told to ""think positive"" or to ""push negative thoughts away""","I don't agree with the way people are told to handle their anxiety.  To simply ""think positive"" and push away any negative/anxiety-inducing thoughts.  To me, that translates to ignoring the negative thoughts regardless of how rational they may be.  It's making them go away temporarily, to deal with at a later time, but not truly *solving* them or eliminating them entirely.

Oftentimes, whatever's causing the negative thoughts are outside of your control.  Many people will tell you to not worry about what you can't control, but my gut reaction is to think ""The only reason you can't control these things is because you *believe* that you can't.  You can't control them if you don't even try to.""  I realize it *isn't* very likely you'll be able to control certain events even if you do try.  But to me, it's like having a 1% chance of being able to control something if you try to control it, and a 0% chance if you don't.  That 1% is important to me.

I hold onto negative thoughts in the hopes that by reflecting on them, I'll somehow figure out a way to eliminate the root cause of those thoughts.  If I merely push them out of my mind, I'm allowing them to haunt me at a later date, and to haunt other people as well.  Pushing them out of my mind makes them go away, but it isn't a *solution*.  Anything less than a solution is unacceptable to me.",12,2016-06-15 19:33:59 EDT-0400

1027,FUCK YES FUCK YES FUCK YES FUCK YES AKA The End of The Worst Year of My Life,"Last year, I went into my first year of college. It was a big step for me, and because of my Aspergers I'm not good at dealing with change. My entire life suddenly changed and this caused a lot of stress and anxiety.

Since October last year I've constantly been extremely stressed out and I haven't been able to sleep. It felt like I was living in the hotel check-in scene from Fear and Loathing In Las Vegas. I was hard on the way to get kicked off of the school and get blacklisted, and this fear consumed my life or the past 9 months. 

What would I do next? I had nowhere to go.  How would my parents react? Probably furiously. 

So in a last-effort attempt to save my ass I sent a letter to the dean to ask for a second chance next year, which is something that only happens in very special cases. 



Today I got an e-mail.



It was the dean.



I can start over next year.

1032,For anyone who thinks they're ugly.,"I think this is the best sub to post this, as it's a feeling I've always felt myself, and have always put it down to my anxiety. 

So anyway, I had a revelation today. Being ugly is not a fact. It's an opinion. So just because you think you're ugly, it doesn't mean everybody else does. Just because one or more people think you are ugly, it doesn't mean that everybody does.

Beauty is in the eye of the beholder, you can't change the level of attractiveness that one person has for you, and nor can they. So why spend time worrying about something that nobody can change? (boy I wish it was that simple.) 

So yeah today I walked to the shop with that in mind and it just seemed to be such a huge confidence booster for me. I'm hoping it can be for you guys too, even if it is for just one person out there. If anyone ever compliments your beauty, don't reject it. Embrace it. 

Edit: Edit: I'm giving out advice that's helped another anxiety sufferer (ok its me) so if you want to reject it, fine. You can only help yourself, nobody can force you to help yourself.",38,2016-07-09 16:25:33 EDT-0400

Because I know that tomorrow, or maybe the next day ( if I'm lucky enough) I won't be able to. Tomorrow is going to be normal, until it suddenly fucking isn't, and then little by little I'll feel like I'm sickenly swallowing a lead weight that points right down to the floor.

1036,I am a musician and entertainer with social anxiety. This is my system of coping with it. I hope this is helpful to someone.,"I am a singer-songwriter who performs regularly on various stages across the country. I suffer from social anxiety, which deters me from many normal type social settings, but I am able to get on stage and perform and talk with fans after the shows successfully because I have figured out a way for me to handle myself and my neuroses. 

The main element of my coping mechanism is that when I get in the car and am driving to wherever the show is that night, I am preparing myself mentally much in the way a method actor would prepare for a role. I immerse myself in this ""stage persona"", that is, the person who is outgoing and emotionally vulnerable and entertaining. By the time I get to wherever I am playing that night, I am essentially acting. I am playing the role of an outgoing extroverted version of myself. From the stage, I am able to exude the confidence as if I were an actor in a play, allowing my fears and insecurities to remain safely hidden away for nobody to find. I only give them what I want to give them. I feel I have complete control over this outgoing person that I am portraying. 

By the end of the night, when I get in my car to go home or to the hotel or wherever, I remove the metaphorical mask and breathe a sigh of relief as I made it through another evening unscathed. I usually drive in silence, allowing myself to begin the recharging process. 

Over the years, it has gotten a bit easier to get into character and handle the intensities of being in that limelight, but it is still something I consciously do and it has allowed me to have a career as an entertainer. I love playing music more than anything else and I would be devastated if I had let my fears and anxieties stand in the way of that. 

Give it a try sometime. Perhaps the next time you venture out to a bar with friends, or a situation in which you are reluctant to participate. 

You are strong enough, you have to believe it. 

I hope this will help someone. Feel free to ask any questions. ",24,2016-07-10 04:35:51 EDT-0400

1039,I need your help. I'm a step away from a suicide. Am I the one that is wrong or all the people around me are just plain stupid?,"Hi,

First of all, let me introduce myself. I'm 28 years old male and working as a senior software engineer. I'm good looking, live in a 3 floor house (doublex). My family is middle class, all alive and healthy. I saved enough money to purchase a flat just in 2 years. I have passive income from the games/projects I developed in the past. I have no trouble finding jobs. I can speak english like my native language and I am overall pretty smart, as I taught myself everything alone. English before I was 10, software engineering before I was 20 and I am still learning new stuff every day. I don't smoke, I don't do drugs, I don't do anything that is bad for my body or my life. If I am driving, I always stay below the speed limit just incase a wild animal appears on road from nowhere so I could brake quicker to save his life. People act like ""Come on... it will take ages for us to reach our destination. Speed up a bit."" but I reject it. We can be late but we can save an animals life unknowingly and prevent outselves from compunction. I am very emotional but usually I follow my logic.

When I bring my issues up, people act like I'm bleufing and tell me that I should be happy because they just don't believe me and always bring the ""There are people whom is in worse conditions than you, feel better."" card. I just can't be happy. Every single day I feel closer and closer to a suicide and lately I'm thinking about what kind of suicide I should prefer. Seriously, all I want to do is get on top of a mountain during midnight, lay down, watch the space for a hour in complete silence thinking I'll be the last man alive on my entire birth chain, close my eyes and let myself fall down... I'm not kidding the slighest. I've always been suicidal but recently it got to a point where a it all matters on one-second decision.

I don't know what is wrong with me but I will write my symptoms so perhabs you can help me identify my issues and seek treatment.

During my childhood I always ripped my eyebrows and hair. Half of my head was bald and I had no eyebrows until highschool. My parents moved me from a physocologist to another because they didn't know why I did it. My parents are very protective. I'm getting close to 30 and they still call me every hour. Where are you? Whom are you with? What did you ate? How much you paid? It is sickening. As a result, I have no friends because nobody wants someone like this in their group. The only friend I have is a guy whom I know since birth. We were raised together, went to same school together and he is like a brother to me. You may think it is a good thing because true friends are hard to find. Let me clarify. He is the only one I went out for a walk for the past 3 years, the one I talked on phone. I just don't have anyone except my family and this guy. No school friends, noone in neighbourhood, nothing. This brought me another issue: I can't stand being in group of people. I've never been to a walk or sit on a table where there are more than 2 people.

In addition, I'm also having mini-heart attacks even if a leaf drops next to me because I am so used to silence. A small sound such as a leaf-drop makes me jump from my chair. This grew another level of weirdness: I hide under my bed when it is stormy outside and I plug my earphones with maximum volume so I don't hear thunder volume/see the light. Those mini heart attacks/shocks started to hurt. I black out for like a second. My heart always aches. When I go outside and it is about to rain, I am literally closing my eyes and praying it doesn't start raining before I get to home. When I get to home I instantly plug my earphones and hide under my bed. The worst part is, I had to do this when there are people in my house. Everyone was like ""Wow... how disrespectful!"" but they just can't understand the fact that I'm not doing this intentionally. I lock my room's door so nobody can see me hiding under the bed.

There is one more thing I fear so much: getting laughed. God knows how many times people laughed me and thought I was some kind of a loser in my entire lifetime. ""A guy whom hides under his bed, haha. What a loser."" People gave me all the weird nicknames on high school and made fun of me. Dead, zombie, graveyard, funeral, corpse, coffin... anything. My teachers were always proud of me and told my family that I could learn things in the future but not grow a decent personality like this. I wasn't good at school because I went my way. People would study biology, physics, math as our school curriculum consisted it. I would escape school to play games and do programming.

Anyhow, after spending an entire life in front of my PC alone, in silence, I had alot of time to question everything. Nowadays, I'm in a complete emptiness. I was religious but I stopped caring about religion. I loved humananity but seeing how I was always abused I stopped caring about humanity. I stopped caring about my nation. I don't care about traditions. There are always huge crashes in me. I want to break my chains, I want to do something; on the other hand, I can't make decisions because I love my family so much and I don't want to be without them.

My mind is full of negative stuff. It started to be a problem in everything about my life. For example, my company (where I work remotely) planned a trip to another country in this december, all expenses paid. I bet everyone would be amazed to hear it. Me? I keep dreaming about plane crashes, I keep dreaming about being put into prison for something I didn't do, I keep dreaming about how I will get scammed and physically hurt. Worst part? My coworkers whom never saw me before but always appreciated my skills, may notice what kind of weird guy I am. A guy escaping to it's hotel and laying under bed just because there are some rain clouds on the sky. I won't be able to be with them and it will always put me behind everything. I will be a random stranger in the company while they all become friends.

Wait, there is alot more. I always feel worthless. My family tells me to find someone and marry as I'm almost 30 and have a job. Are they kidding??? I can't even make eye contact with anyone. I never spoke to a woman (except my mother and few relatives) on my entire lifetime nor touched anyone's hand. Whenever I tried to do it I laughed to me face. For the past 15 years I didn't even say ""Hi"" to anyone. I'm still a virgin. I can't even do anything sexually. I will never do it with money either because I am sure I will question what made her do it for money. I will never abuse someone just because life was harsh to them. I will dream about her birth, her mother holding her and wishing a good future for her. You know what, people laugh when I say it but who the fuck cares. It is either full white or full black to me - there is no gray, and I will stand by what I believe to be true.

People are greedy. (well, science also says so) They dream about marrying, buying a car, having a house, growing kids, earning more money etc. I will never marry, I'm not confident enough and I fear not being able to protect her. Even if a miracle happens I happen to marry someone; thinking about dancing in front of people during my wedding increases my heartbeat and makes my hands shake. Did I tell you how I stopped caring about tradition and it is all black or white to me? I'll simply tell her about not making a wedding and tell everyone that they should feed 4 animals/children instead of buying us presents. (I always do those weird stuff and annoy traditional people. Their stupid beliefs make me laugh.) Rejected? Okay. White or black after all. Bye. She will feel like she is going to die in the first week and forget it on the second.

I don't care about money. You will laugh at me... but few days ago I almost burned all my savings (valued approx $300K in United States) because I was pissed off. Decided to break my phone into pieces instead and told me mother to hide them somewhere I can't react so I don't do stupid things when I'm angry. A guy telling his mother to hide his own money, all my savings for years, so he doesn't burn them for fun. I sure sound normal, right?

The negativity I have is unbelivable but people think I'm just bleufing. My company wanted to give me a salary raise this year but wanted me to sign few papers for legal purposes. I rejected. When I sign papers I feel like it will be used to scam me (as our family had troubles with this in the past) so I reject everything. Currently, I work without a contract, which means I'm not working legally/I'm an illegal worker in terms of law.

I always question everything. There are like hundreds of questions on my mind at any given time. What's the purpose of life? What is the purpose of gods? When will my family die? When will I kill myself? How should I kill myself? How can I tell people to fuck off during my funeral? How can I reject the ""funeral tradition""? Should I write a death note and tell them to not make any funerals for me or my ghost will chase them eternally? Should I be buried or be burned in a crematorium? Where should I ask them to bury me in? Believe me, even at the most normal days, I think those like hundreds of times in a single day.

My parents were so strict about me and it could be ""one of the"" reasons why I became like this. I'm allowed to bicycle but only on the road next to our house so they can watch me. Not when I was 6 or 7. When I was 19 years old grown adult. I went to a school trip in my early 20's and they wanted me to call them every hour and give reports. My friend sometimes makes jokes about this situation and asks me if I am going to call my mother when I lose my virginity. ""Yeah mother, she has a hole. We're still at the oral part. She went to bedroom to take her clothes off."" Like, what? He is joking but that is the truth, sadly.

In addition, I was always compared to other people. The random girl in neighbourhood whom scored A on exam, my father's friend's son whom was a decent soccer player. I never had a compliment until I started making money from my hobby. (programming) Nowadays they act like: ""Come on, why are you so negative? You're making a decent amount of money and your job is a great skill in today's world."" Fuck the money if my family questions every single purchase I make. I can't even go out and have a nice dinner alone because they would complain and tell me that I could eat X instead which costs less. (remember that I told you our family had some troubles legally. We had to pay loads of money for something WE DON'T KNOW) I'm sick of this but on the other hand... I understand why they are like this. They don't even turn the light on so we could lower our electricity bill a bit. I don't blame them, because the next day our phone may ring once again and all my savings could be gone the next day.

So, the crashes in me... Should I live freely or support my family till the end? Should I move to another country and finally break my chains and start a new life, or should I keep staying with them till the end? Should I be ignorant like everyone else, follow traditions, marry, breed, be happy, or continue doing whatever I believe to be correct and honorable? Why should I care about people's validation if I decide to ignore all of them and live happily with loads of dogs in a completely isolated wooden house? Humans in my eyes (except a minority) are virus. Their genes are greedy. They are greedy. They will destroy the planet they live in. They will blame you if you tell them their beliefs and traditions are stupid. They will spit on roads, they will rage during traffic, they will tailgate you, they will laugh at your face when they get the chance, they will scam innocent people.

My anxiety is so intense. I can't even go to a 1 week all-expenses-paid company trip. I just can't guys... I fear everything. I can only work in remote because I hate open-space environment. I hate asking for private room either because it makes me feel bad when there are others working in open space. I'm not special. I feel bad when I treated differently. I rejected many jobs because of this (not offers, but when they told me to stay tomorrow. I took my papers and left the building) although I was jobless and were treated like a shit for a very long time.

Collapse over collapse, crash over crash and I grew a severe anger problem. The guy in traffic did something wrong, opened his window and blamed you? My eyes turn red, my body starts shaking, every single hatred I grew for humanity instantly adds up to my anger. I want to crash his car intentionally. I want to hit his car over and over again. I want to pull him out and punch him until he learns basic traffic rules. I fear myself hurting someone because I hate people who abuse innocent living beings. You may say, ""We all feel the same, traffic makes the people angry."" If you ever chased a car just to intentionally hit from behind, let me know.

No, I'm a calm guy, really. I just instantly explode with anger on certain circumstances, especially when people are wrong but they believe they are correct and want to take advantage of abusing the innocent one.

I also don't forget anything negative. If someone tells me ""Oh hey mate, we didn't see eachother for the last 25 years. How are you doing?"" I can simply tell them that to fuck off just because they told me stupid and laughed my face 25 years ago. People's instincs never change. If they abused someone whom was weaker than them once, they will continue doing in the future.

So, here I am. Perfectly normal looking guy with a good job, family and a bright future, yet there is a complete chaos and clashes inside me that nobody can see. Why should I care about a car, or a house, or a wife, or fame, or compliments, or money, or life itself when an epic ending to million years old life chain sounds much more tempting? The only reason I don't do it right now is because I don't want to make my family feed bad after my death. It must be a terrible feeling for my parents to lose their son.

Lastly, I can't remember things anymore. Half of my thoughts are real, half of them are just made up assumptions. I am leaving house, coming back to check the door. A minute later I forget if I checked it, coming back to check it again. A minute later, once again and this time for good.

When I google my symptoms up I get alot of results. Severe anxiety, socialphobia, paranoid anxiety, astraphobia, panic attack, borderline personality disorder, even early levels of schizophrenia.

What do you think about my issues? Should I write a small note (a summary of everything I wrote here) and bring it with me to my physotherapist?

Sorry for the long post. Wanted to give details as much as I can.

Thank you.",25,2016-07-09 21:24:45 EDT-0400
1040,Finally started taking Citalopram,"I'd had enough. I walked into the doctors last Thursday, and asked if they had any appointments. When the receptionist said they didn't have any appointments for a month, she asked if I was well. 

I said ""Mentally, no.""

She made me an appointment the next morning. I didn't know this was a thing. I didn't know I could go in and say my life was slipping away from me and they'd actually take me seriously. 

I went home, and I told my wife. I'd love to say either of us broke down but honestly, she was just relieved and supportive. I just felt tired.

I realised that anxiety had become a lens through which I viewed the world. A shield that had somehow grown into a wall. I had been scared of taking antidepressants for so long because I thought they would change who I am, without realising the anxiety was already doing that. 

I went to the doctor and told her the problem. Living with my sister-in-law is hard, but my anger and reaction to her has grown wildly disproportionate over time. The doctor asked if I thought about killing myself, but I said I was more worried about the stress giving me a heart attack than anything else. She wrote it all down, weighing up i'm sure which drug would cover the most (or at least the most important) problems. 

She gave me a prescription, and I started taking it a few days ago. She said it would take about a month, 6 weeks to really kick in. But just taking something, telling someone I need help, has given me hope that i'll get better, i'll be a good husband again, get a job and get us out of here. ",16,2016-07-11 03:40:55 EDT-0400

Why should you care what anyone else thinks about you?"" but I honestly have no idea how to do that. Even if it's a person who I KNOW has poor judgement or I don't respect, it stills upsets me.

1046,Best way to detach yourself (or break) destructive thought pattern ingrained since childhood?,"Hi all,

I was hardwired at a very young age into thinking that you cannot succeed at everything and that something bad will happen to you if you do. 

I have this memory of being a child (maybe 7-8) in my parents' car as we were driving through this rich neighborhood, and I saw a beautiful house by the water and told my mom: look how nice that house is, and my mom replied: ""well that guy probably is dying of cancer or something. You cannot succeed at everything in life"". 

I'm 35 today and I'm realizing that this phrase has affected me deeply. I can't blame her though because her mother told her the same thing so it's passed down every generation. Also this was something a lot of people said and believed in when I was a child, not just in my family. 

Now I'm reaching a point in my life where I feel like I CAN succeed in everything. I won't get into details but basically all the doors are open in front of me but I'm afraid of opening them. Basically I'm self-destroying myself to make sure that at least something is wrong in my life. How horrible is that? Whenever everything is too good I tend to develop anxiety and start looking for things that are wrong. When people congratulate me for having done something great, I am anxious instead of happy. I'm constantly worried about my health and cancer and heart issues when things are too good.

Here is where I'm at today:

- I know that you definitely CAN succeed at everything if you want to. The world is full of examples of people that lived happily and died past 80 peacefully in their sleep in their large beautiful mansion surrounded by a large loving family. 

- I understand 100% that this is a wrong through pattern ingrained in me from childhood and I wish I could detach myself from it.

What do you guy suggest? Any way I can either detach myself from this type of thinking and see it as ""an external entity"" and not part of myself, or perhaps change the way I view it somehow? 

Any modern psychotherapy approach could work in this case? CBT or any of that stuff? Or perhaps a technique I can practice daily to ignore these thoughts?

At this point I'm considering an Ayahuasca or Iboga psychedelic experience to try and dive into this inner world of mine and figure out how to deal with it because it's making me unhappy and I'm only living at like 50% of my true potential.

1047,Job interview in an hour,"Well, I have a job interview in an hour.  I'm really trying to calm myself down before hand and keep and open mind.  I definitely have performance anxiety and feel like I'm walking into something I have to be perfect at.  I know this isn't the case and I am really trying to stay calm but these kinds of things are really hard for me.  Telling myself it won't be as bad as I think it is makes me more anxious because what if it is.  

Anyway, figured I'd post here as way to get these thoughts out and calm myself.  Thanks for reading.

1049,Constant anxiety about falling behind in my career and in life,"I've had generalized anxiety my whole life, but the last few years have been focused on falling behind. I'm 23, graduated college with a bachelor's last year and have a good job in the design field. But it never seems good enough. I always worry that my job isn't design oriented enough (I have a lot of administrative duties) and I am falling behind. I fear that if/when I ever need to get a new job, I won't have the skills. I don't want to leave my job though..the pay is decent, I have a set amount of hours, and for the most part (other than the crippling anxiety which would come regardless), I can leave work at work. I know I have it pretty good but my anxiety refuses to let me calm down.

I thought maybe selling designs on Etsy would help with the anxiety...I could do this to keep up with new designs and make some extra money. But I recently read that people are cracking down on trademarks and copyrights, which pretty much everything is now and I have an extreme amount of anxiety about getting sued. So, so much for that.

So now that Etsy fell through because I'm terrified, I don't feel like I'm doing anything productive at home. It's like I always need to be productive and work on improving my skills otherwise I freak out. It's exhausting and no matter what I do to improve those skills, I'm not even sure if they're the right ones to be improving.

My social anxiety makes it worse because I don't want to ask for advice from anyone in person. I wouldn't even know where to start with looking for a mentor to help guide me...

Any advice on how to calm these thoughts?",11,2016-07-13 17:07:55 EDT-0400

1056,"I tried CBD (cannibidiol) for my GAD (anxiety) for the first time and for the first time in decades, I feel normal.","I live in a non medical marijuana state. I was able to obtain 250 mg while traveling to Colorado of RX Releaf high CBD pediatric whole plant extract tincture.  
I was a longtime pot smoker but quit 3 years ago bc it started to increase my anxiety BIG TIME for the first 3 hours, the benefits to sleep and appetite were still there but the anxiety at first became overwhelming. I continued to try it once a year with the same effect. Extreme anxiety, freaking out, slight paranoia, & just..worrying about all my problems. I thought my days of cannabis use were over.  
I began to read about CBD, its positive effect for epilepsy in children, anxiety, & depression. I read about how THC is the ""high"" in weed & *can* create anxiety in some ppl. Weed has been bred for high THC on the black market but breeders are beginning to grow CBD rich plants bc of the positive medicinal properties.  
I tried it today. 8 drops. It works! It's like I took a xanax except I'm not sleepy, I don't ""feel"" it, I don't feel high in the slightest, nothing. There is *almost* no THC. I feel calm, collected, organized, very clear headed. This stuff works for me! I haven't tested it over time but we'll see. I may be traveling to Colorado more until it's legal here, it almost is. A bill almost passed this year & I'm sure it will in the future. 75% of my state approves of medicinal MJ.  
I encourage anyone with anxiety to try it. You do not get high & it has completely eliminated my anxiety, at least for today. It is a miracle. I'm not some big pro weed fixes everything type. This stuff is amazing! I feel hope. HOPE. I'm even smiling, Un.Be.Liev.Able. I'm not exaggerating, I've had an anxiety disorder for as long as I can remember, diagnosed by top psychiatrists. Only benzos work but they are extremely addicting & tolerance builds fast. It feels like I took 2, klonopin without the...fog, sedation.. Incredible.

Edit: please forgive me on the title, I was excited, ok? This is what's great: No smoke, no lung issues, it's NOT addictive, & I'm not stoned! I can drive!....but not write, I am happy, it's insane.  
Edit2: I don't want to be giving out wrong info & I just noticed, it actually has a ratio of 13:1 CBD to THC. There is in fact a miniscule  amount of THC in this product. ",83,2016-05-12 00:09:20 EDT-0400

1059,Should I be worried? Nsfw,"I have a few things bothering me a lot at the moment and very much need some serious advice.

When I was 4/5, I was sitting on my Dad's lap helping him steer a car into the back yard, I suddenly felt something hard against my backside, he then asked if I could feel it, and I said yes, we then got out of the car. My Mum then asks why he had an erection, he tells Mum that I was sitting on his lap. She then starts to get jealous and asks what was wrong with her, and they have a small argument before she walks inside, leaving me alone with him. He then asks me to come towards him, with a very deivant expression, I suddenly felt anxious, and say no before running inside and going to my bedroom. He then follows me inside, and enters my bedroom. My Mum and myself yell at him to leave me alone, him and Mum have another small argument before he drives off. Mum then comes into my bedroom later to tell me not to tell anyone about what happened, because people will come to take me away.

Then, when I was about 11/12 he would enter the bathroom while I was showering everyday, even though I expressed to him that I wanted my privacy many times. I asked him to stop, I asked my Mum to talk to him. The bathroom door would be closed (no lock), but he would still come in. His reasons for entering would change, sometimes it was to wash his hands, to check his face in the mirror (which was located directly in front of the mirror), or to just have a chat because he hadn't seen me all day. I would complain to my Mum everyday, and she would just say she would talk to him, or even said that I always showered while he was home so I must want him to look at me.

These memories have been causing me a great deal of stress, but I'm confused about if they're serious, and if I should be worried about them?
I have two young daughters myself now, and I'm worried about their safety around my parents.

1061,Tips for those with frequent panic attacks or and SO's of people that have them.,"I know theres tons of tips on the sidebar. But if you're like me, deep breathing and meditation just doesn't help pull you out of panic anymore. These are the things I've been doing recently to stop a panic attack before it swallows me and to pull myself out if it already has:

DO's:

1. Read. Literally read anything. Out loud. No books around? Read the boxes of products you have laying around. Read the posters in your classroom. Before you know it, you're a bit calmer.

2. Play a relaxing android/iOS game. My favorite is Hay Day. Collect eggs from your chickens. Sell your products to other players. Join a neighborhood. Strive to unlock that new piece of equipment! Eventually you'll be lost in the game trying to make more cash and unlock fun things. (Also a bonus, there is NO need to buy anything with real money here.) Another favorite is Plague Inc. It really makes you think.

3. Play with your pet. Grab a toy and play tug of war with your dog. Shake a laser point across the room and watch your cat go wild. Put your hamster in a ball and witness his joy as he runs amuck. Don't have a pet? I would definitely recommend one. Dogs know when you're upset and will try to comfort you. My dog actually has anxiety as well and starts shaking when I'm upset. So a lot of the time I have to tell myself ""Deanna, you're stressing the dog out, get a grip!"". And cats? There purring is super calming.

4. Go outside and put your bare feet in the sand. Its called earthing, I believe and has its benefits. Look it up. Draw in the sand while doing so. Dig a small hole. Listen to the birds and all the nature around you.

5. Put on a funny show or even a cartoon. My favorites are impractical jokers, the carbanaro effect, and spongebob. Its hard to be upset when you see jokers running around making you laugh.

6. Solve basic math problems. What's 9 x 14? What's 27 ÷ 3? Etc. 

7. Talk to yourself. Tell yourself you are fine and that you are acting ridiculous over nothing. Sometimes you have to be a little harsh to get the point across.

I have tons more and may post them another time. If you have tips feel free to suggest them. I just see so many people on several different reddits asking how to cope and how to help their bf/gfbget out of them. Maybe we need a huge list compiled of our personal tips since not everything works for every person. Unless we already have that? I'm pretty new here. Hah.",7,2016-05-14 00:46:32 EDT-0400
1062,Please don't ever be pressured into taking ecstasy or any pills when you have anxiety.,"I went out for the first time in a while and was pressured into taking MDMA. I got light headed and it hit me like a brick wall. My anxiety is through the roof, I can't sit down and I have work. It's currently 4am in Australia, I also have emetophobia and heard my neighbour being sick as I got home. This night cannot get any worse. 

So please, if you deal with anxiety, depression or any sort of mental illness do not be pressured into drugs or do it in a safe environment with close friends. These symptoms will double and make it impossible to relax. 
If anyone can reassure me that I'll be fine, it would help so much, I've never done drugs before.

EDIT: I thought I might make a little update to anyone who might be interested in the come down state I experienced. It is about 19 hours later since I took the pill. I definitely felt like shit today and didn't sleep until about 9am up until 12pm, then I had to get ready for work. I woke up quite depressed and in a mental state I haven't been in for a long time, running on no sleep and dealing with last night I guess kinda of hit me. I had quite a loss of appetite, however I ate a bowl of fruit like u/tragicfucker recommended and felt a bit better. As the night went on, I started to become more tired then I was depressed which definitely was a better feeling than the latter. Thank you guys for all your reassurance and stories, I read every single one and it was helping me so much while I was peeking this morning. ",41,2016-05-13 22:15:26 EDT-0400

1066,I did it… I finally graduated college.,"Long-time lurker, made an account just to post this.

It took me 6 years. I never took a break because I knew I would never come back. I was in weekly therapy almost continuously. The last 2 years I was also attending a weekly group therapy on top of individual counseling. It was constant med switches until finally they found something that worked (but not before I got all looped out on Prozac and failed Bio 311). I had a breakdown almost every semester: nonstop crying, unable to breathe, oxygen hunger all over the fucking place, eating disorders everywhere, crippling fear. Twice I locked myself in my apartment, nailed blankets over the windows and didn’t come out for several days.

But most of the time, it was just that intractable, uncomfortable, buzzing haze of anxiety. My constant study-buddy.

This past semester I got introduced to the wonders of domestic violence, and I had to be escorted from my former home by the cops. I lost everything and I was living in some kind of shelter with *roommates* and I have HORRIBLE social anxiety and my room used to be my safe space—and worst of all, they didn’t allow pets, so I had to leave my dogs with a kennel. My dogs were more supportive to me than therapy or meds combined. Having everything taken away so brutally was the worst experience of my life.

But now at least I have my Bachelor of Science. I have no idea how it happened. Every single day I wanted to quit, I fucking failed over and over, but I *wanted* my degree. I know it’s just a piece of paper that most people earn in 4 years (I have a friend who got hers in 3), it doesn’t guarantee me some great future, and I know my 2.8 GPA is *hardly* something to brag about—all of this stuff is so embarrassing to talk about with my “normal” friends who all have >3.0 GPAs and are finishing on time.

But I just wanted to tell someone who knows what it means to fight anxiety, because we all have to do it every single day and for once, I have something to show for it. I’ve quit and failed almost everything else—relationships, jobs, broken dreams I used to have before anxiety grabbed me like a chimp and ripped my face off.

Now I know that my anxiety *will not* stop me, and therapy and medication *do* help sometimes, when you find the right combination. These are two things that I was never convinced of throughout this whole process. I seriously just had to keep trying somehow. It was never pretty. In fact most of the time it was horrendous. But I think it was worth it.

TL;DR: I graduated college.",15,2016-05-10 21:43:31 EDT-0400

Although I dont see her any differently at all and wont treat her any differently at all, im just wondering if there any behaviors i should be letting slide of encouraging for now onwards, 
for example, she is often scared to choose somewhere for us to go on a date, or to order food etc, should I be encouraging her to step out of her shell in these situations of should I ease her anxiety by doing these things for her?

1071,My anxiety and depression literally take turns destroying me,"My most recent depressive episode is beginning to lift after about a month and a half, which means while I'm no longer suicidal, the numb sleepiness wears off, and my anxiety takes a deep breath and starts SCREAMING. It's like moving to the opposite side of the spectrum. Last week my English teacher was like, ""You really aren't putting enough effort in, it really doesn't seem like you care,"" and I just gave him the most tired look and said, ""I'm clinically depressed, Mr. ___. There's a lot of things I don't care about."" As opposed to two days ago when my Design teacher handed out the new assignments and the stress nearly made me cry and my friend was so confused, he was like ""we haven't even started yet"" and that kind of explains a lot of my life, tbh. End me. ",12,2016-05-08 12:48:41 EDT-0400
1072,"So I'm starting to a date a girl who may have really bad anxiety, please help.","We've been on a few dates, she's been over to my place to watch movies, and she seems to really like me, but I get the feeling that she is *constantly* uncomfortable.

We've only done so much as hold hands. I've talked to some people who know her better and they say she's always been somewhat anxious, or stressed.

Today I read through almost this entire subreddits /top/alltime posts and I feel like a lot of the things mentioned here apply to her. We once briefly had a conversation about how she's feeling, and I think she may have some serious anxiety issues. 

She takes a very long time to reply to messages, she never initiates anything on her own, she is always worrying about being an inconvenience to me, she brushes off compliments I give her, she will often put herself last unless I explicitly invite her to join (for example, she came over to my friends house and we were all going to watch a movie. The couch was crowded and she offered to stand... Alone... So we made room and she sat beside me after a few prompts). She once even said that I was ""intimidating"", even though I feel like I've been extremely gentle and patient. Normally, these would all be signs that the relationship is failing and I would just start dating someone else, but she seems to really like me (and she's even said that she does), especially since we continue to see each other. 

How should I go about letting her know that I care? How can I approach the situation without causing any further stress? She's a really cool person and I'd like to keep the relationship going. I used to have really severe panic attacks as a kid, so I know how it goes, but I never get them anymore. (I now haven't had a panic attack over 6 years.) I don't know, however, if she has panic attacks or if she's just nervous. Should I bring up the subject?

Were going on another date on Wednesday, she's taking me to her favorite coffee shop.",12,2016-05-09 18:40:40 EDT-0400

I've always had some anxiety but in the last year or so I've become unable to have conversations unless they're thought out in advance, make dumb, ditzy mistakes, like I spell words wrong all the time now, and couldn't figure out how to turn a computer mouse on. 

I feel like my brain has been traded with someone who's a complete idiot- like reality TV level. When I was younger I wasn't like this at all and took a lot of pride in my intelligence- but now I can't even read a news article without reading it like 5 times to say it back, let alone comprehend a scholarly article or bs something on the spot.

1078,"DAE get intense anxiety when given a choice to make , e.g. having to say yes or no to an invitation?","I find that whenever I have some sort of choice to make my body freezes badly. E.g. tonight my dad asked if I wanted to see *Crimson Peak* with him and his friend tomorrow. As much as I admire Gullermo del Toro's work, considering I've been struggling to get out of bed lately, I don't feel a realistic horror film about a haunted house is going to help chill me out or lift my spirits! 

But, I worried that Dad would be offended by turning him down, or would see this as some sign of relapse, like I *should* be going, to get out of the house etc.. And now I'm having flashbacks to times I disappointed people, made them upset and one time in particular I reduced someone who I care for a lot to tears, she's no longer in my life… this is despite the fact Dad has said ""it's OK don't worry"", my brain is screaming HE'S LYING. 

Historically when this situation has turned up I have sometimes been frozen with anxiety all night from guilt shame and the 'what if', and turned up late for work/voluntary/lectures/friend's socials/doctor's apt.s etc. the next day. 

In other incidents I would get the sudden idea that e.g. people wanted me to get really drunk so I'd 'fit in' better, and I end up compulsively drinking…or I'd get the idea my girlfriend wanted to break up with me and was planning to cheat on me, so I'd start sabotaging the relationship until surprise, they actually *did* want to dump me. Sometimes this occurs when I'm an insomniac paranoid state and not entirely aware of what is going on. 

I seem very susceptible to unusual or 'overvalued' ideas one of my old therapists said, and compelled to act upon them to relieve the anxiety.

Anyway does anyone else struggle with these sorts of thing and how did they learn to manage it?

But maybe 2 years ago I started to notice that I can't watch thriller or intense things anymore. I have to pause it in between and take breaks, or google the synopsis to find out what happens next before watching it. I was just watching Jessica Jones and literally felt the fight or flight reaction and I feel physically weak. It's like movies and things are too emotionally straining for me now... I can only watch lighthearted things or comedy and it's making me sad because movies was one of my favourite hobbies.

I'm happier with money because I can be part of 'society' again which is crazy because some the best times have come from not spending a penny and meeting new friends or doing fun things for free.

update: it's payday in a new job. I hate my job. Money wasn't going to help here. Starting to think I have undiagnosed mental issues since the money seems to be going to drugs medicinal and illegal. Money won't solve all my problems. Going to a docs to get help. ",24,2016-01-13 09:41:21 EST-0500
1082,Derealization/depersonalization,"There's a recent post in here where OP was scared about nothing being real and going crazy, and I shared my own experience with derealization. It's such a recurring feeling for me that I too am worried about my mental health. I try my best to ignore it but it always comes back, occasionally in the form of a coincidence or deja vu. Sometimes it's as though I'm in a dream and the world seems fuzzy or hazy, then other times it's like I'm living in some heightened sense of reality. 

Every once in a while out of nowhere it'll hit me so strongly that my stomach will drop and I'm shifted into some altered perspective of what's real. Then once I'm in that state of mind, there's always one word that pops into my head: old. The first time I felt this I was in elementary school.

I always try to tell myself that it's just anxiety and everything is fine, until I remember that I exist in a universe that either came from nothing or always was, and I'm living on a planet spinning around in space when really existence itself is a mystery. Why is there anything at all? How is it that the human mind evolved in such a way that we're aware of our own existence and mortality? Regardless of whether or not you even have anxiety, you must admit it's all so strange. 

Sometimes I look in the mirror and say ""this is me"". It may sound odd but when I stop autopilot and allow my mind to realize itself, my reflection almost seems unfamiliar.

Keep in mind that I don't always think this way, but it's enough to make me question my sanity even though I live a seemingly normal life. Wondering if the entire universe just exists in my mind isn't something normal people do, is it?

I just want to see if anyone else can describe their experiences with derealization/depersonalization so that I won't feel so alone. Hopefully there's someone out there who can relate.",36,2016-01-10 00:43:48 EST-0500

When I'm drunk everything is normal, ego is at the normal level, not every discussion is an attempt to manipulate me, not every discussion is supposee to be either perfect/awkward. Most conversations are in-between even amongst non anxious people there are a lot of awkward moments. Anyway my idea is that alcohol gives me good self esteem, self love and makes me deal with people for who they are. If they are good I'll be good to them, if they're bad they'll get equal treatement.

During this period I try and eat healthy, make sure I go to the gym and make sure I smile/laugh as much as possible and generally try to be a better person. 

But every time I come down with a crash and end up back on the /r/anxiety or /r/depression threads feeling sorry for myself and generally feeling shit.

I have tried online counselling which didn't help (Weekly emails) and am waiting to see the GP after filling out some forms about mental health. But what I realised with the counselling is the weekly emails didn't help when I needed it because I could maybe have a 1/2 anxiety attacks in between each email and spend hours thinking about what to write in each one. 

Sop what I am asking/proposing is some of us form a group so that when we have good days we can all celebrate and communicate and on bad days we can be talked out of our anxiety/encouraged. This could be on reddit/whatsapp/email or whatever platform but just to feel constantly connected to a supportive group any time someone has negative thoughts or a big win that they have noone else to share with.

Because i am so anxious in public and around people, i am always tense and find it hard to smile. I get paranoid too. I had a bad history of bullying and people making fun of me in the streets that i always am in high alert when in public. Today i went with my mother out to buy a few things and when we were standing outside a store talking about if she wants to buy something in front of it. I had an umbrella out and a random man walking past says to me ""Hello girl"". For some reason i got really anxious and couldn't say anything. I felt embarrassed of my appearance and didn't want him to see how i really looked. I focused on my mother and what she was saying. Then notice through corner of my eye that the guy kept looking back. I felt bad :. Apparently my mother did not hear him, so i try to tell myself that hopefully i made him think that i did not hear him and  my back was also facing him as well. 


But still i felt bad and when i told my mom she said that ""you see you make people feel bad too/can be rude too.""

He told me the concerns with benzos and I also read about them so I was trying my best to go as many days without them but during the month of July I was taking one every day to be able to function. 

We had another meeting 4 weeks ago and he switched me to 10mg of Lexapro because I didn't feel better. However during those 4 weeks I improved a lot, went a day without a benzo, then got up to 2 days, 3, etc. and today I'm happy to announce 1 week without having one! I feel pretty good, still a bit anxious, afraid of throwing up when I go out, and certain situations still cause panic, but I saw my doc today for a follow up and he was very proud of my progress. He said I will continue to see improvements with Lexapro and will prescribe me Ativan if I need it, and now I'm working to find a psychologist as he said one day I might be able to come off Lexapro with the help of CBT.

Just feeling pretty good about life and my progress so far! Hopefully this inspires some hope that things can get better. Also medication was a literal life saver for me.",13,2016-08-25 03:18:52 EDT-0400

1111,A chatbot to learn to better cope with worries and anxiety,"It's an app I've been working on for 6 months now and I'd love to have you try it out and hear your feedback. It works via Facebook Messenger - and it's a chatbot. I'm confident it can really help people learn how to better deal with worries and anxiety:

http://pocketcoach.co/

It's made up of chat conversations that take a few (usually not more than 5) minutes per day. In these chats, you learn small lessons and exercises that are designed to gradually help you build coping skills and resilience.
It's aimed at people who experience worry or feelings of anxiety and want to do something about it - but it's not an alternative for a professional treatment. Rather it's for those people who experience mild and moderate levels of anxiety.",35,2016-08-27 15:24:31 EDT-0400

But now I'm all worried! She said I seemed like a fun person and asked for my number so she could text me if she wanted to hang out sometime all while smiling at me. So my problem is that I'm not really all that fun like she said, and that I am not sure she understood what kind of interest I had in her.

I can honestly get over those two things and those can get worked out, but my problem is that I keep having thoughts like ""What if I gave her the wrong number? What if it didn't save properly in her phone!? I'll never get a chance to see her again if that number doesn't work! I should have asked her to text me before we parted! Why didn't I make sure it worked!?""

1118,Why am I so sensitive?,"I have always worried about things since I was a little but I think after years of being bullied, and rejection, and guys treating me wrong it got worse. My anxiety is so high when I date anyone because I worry about such little things. I over think in my head and I feel my heart pound and I feel tingly. I don't know how to stop it and I know it stresses me out and my significant other. I hear every tone anyone gets me and if they sound irritated it triggers me and makes me feel like I'm annoying them and that in itself makes my anxiety shoot up. So many things bother me that shouldn't, it's so hard. I recently moved in with my boyfriend and we've been working together since April. He's in a higher position to me and he may be getting promoted and be transferred and it makes me so sad and worries me. He helps me out a lot here and I'm so use to seeing him here...we both stay at work more than we're at home. I'm just really scared, stressed, and anxious. I'm not use to change.

1119,So I failed at life again,"Finally managed to score a job interview., which was for today. I had a week to prepare myself, which also meant a week of sleepless nights. The whole time I basically pushed my interview thoughts to the back of my mind, thinking that it would be best not to dwell on anything until the actual day. 

Well today came around. I woke up and was immediately silent and in my own head, barely talking to my girlfriend - who knew I would be like this and jumped right to being supportive. The build up of emotion started and I broke down. First crying. Then hyperventilating. Then the feelings of wanting to give up. After about an hour of this, I did. I gave up. Like always. I felt as if there was no way I would be able to leave the house. Let alone make it there and have a conversation with someone who was tasked to assess me. Now the relief has washed over me, but the panic is instead replaced with feelings of disappointment and hatred for myself. I feel like I am not made for this world. Like I am abnormal and defective.

It's often not even something I'm trying to cover up. Sometimes when I'm asked a question (especially if put on the spot or in front of other people) I will panic and just say something without thinking it through or without fully understanding the question and then ask myself ""why the hell did I say that, it's not remotely true"". And then I'll be too nervous to correct myself so I don't say anything and spend the next few hours running it over and over in my head. It doesn't really get me in trouble because like I said a lot of the time it's about really unimportant stuff, but it's still very irritating.

1128,For most of my adult life I have been unemployable due to my anxiety. So much has changed since then and i want to share my story with you,"Today, I'm in a class of nearly 40 Japanese JHS students, every English teacher in the school and important people from the board of education. The lesson, which is usually made by me, was very poor because Japanese teacher I work with made the plan and I translated it though her (low level) English. Today she was a nervous wreck and I was cool, calm and collected.

I'm an Assistant Language Teacher in Japan. Been here for over a year and a half. I came here as a challenge and to see the world. About seven years ago my psychologist said that I would be exploring big cities like Tokyo one day. Back then I didn't believe her. 

At 18 I was diagnosed with panic attacks, depression and anxiety. The combination of genetics, an abusive parent, poor grades, a shitty job, living in a tiny and remote town and no direction. I managed to only pass high school because we worked out a deal where I sit at the back of the exam room and allowed music. Thinking back now, I can't even imagine what I looked or sounded like.

Eventually an incident at 19 got me kicked out of home and into the world. Most people head around the world or into higher learning at this age. Me, I just started working the same shitty job but this time in a new town. Even that proved too much and I ended up on unemployment benefits. Sometimes I had a job but nothing lasted more than 3 months, like any relationship I had.

Stayed there with various minor substance abuse issues and other addictions until 25 when I finally got the psychiatric help I needed. I found out how abusive that parent really was, how my thinking could be changed and new paths that I could take to recovery. 

26, I moved to the city and by 27 I was traveling the country. At 28 a job fell in my lap and I took it. Teaching students one on one. 

I still had my off days at work but my boss was supportive. I managed to work there for two years while I studied for my degree. I was still on benefits but my reliance was becoming less and less as my employment confidence grew.

Then I got a job in Japan, sold everything I had and moved countries. I remember being on the train coming into Tokyo from the airport, ""What my psych said came true. I'm actually doing this!"" When I stepped into my first class it was the worst class in the worst school. That's when I thought ""What the fuck have I done."" At 18, I would have run away. I wouldn't know how to manage my emotions. All I could think was ""just stay put and focus on the task at hand"".

That's what I did and I survived. Since then I've had other days like that but I know I can deal with them. Now I'm teaching full classes with relative ease but it took a while for the training wheels to come off.

Today my anxious Japanese teacher was all over the place. Coming up to me and wanting to change the plan. Erratic in her thoughts and actions. I could see why (because she wants to do a good job) but it was unnecessary. Just relaxing and working through what we planned was best. I look at her and see my old self. I respond to her in a calm voice and tell her that it's okay, everything is under control. I'm responding to my old self as my new self.

The class went fairly terribly but after in the meeting I stayed relaxed. I spoke when I felt it necessary and didn't take anything personally.
 
During and after the class I had a few moments of zen. Realizing how far I had come and how hard I've worked at controlling my emotions. If my 18 year old self was told what I was doing now he would never believe it.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

I must say that I have little reason to come to this sub now. I try to look to the future instead of my past. That said, I hope that my story can inspire others. I have been long term unemployed, on the brink of homelessness, had breakdowns, throw out of share houses, failed subjects, been addicted and isolated myself. Somehow I made it through and each little success (now matter how small) built me into who I am today. I'm still learning but today warranted some reflection.

1131,I need a ton of alone time to cope,"Hi everyone, 

While I may appear like I am a functioning human being, the reality is that I need a ton of alone time to get by. I work 40 hours a week, and in the evenings I barely ever make plans because I need time afterwards to decompress, as work is extremely stressful. When the weekend finally comes I spend at least a full day recovering in my apartment [resting, cleaning, cooking, watching Netflix, whatever]. Sometimes for the whole weekend, the only time I'll go out is for groceries out of necessity. I'm anxious all the time and feel like I don't have enough free time. I feel I'm on the edge of major burn out. I'd stay in more if I could. 

I recognize that a 40 hour job isn't that much on my plate. I'm lucky I don't also go to school, work a second job, or have a demanding family. Instead I'm alone, single, and don't really have friends, because keeping up a social life just sounds exhausting. I don't want to live like this forever. I want to do more.

1135,My best friend died of a drug overdose last night,"She died last night and I found out this morning. Her roommate found her last night, she was already braindead by the time paramedics arrived. She's being kept alive so they can harvest her organs.

Her and I have known eachother since we were 3, we were born in the same hospital 5 hours apart from each other. We both shared the same birthday, we turn 20 in only a few days. I love her, not romantically, but I love her with all my heart, we had a special bond. We drifted apart over the past 3 years, we went to different high schools and different colleges, ran with different crowds of people, but she was always on my mind. I had dreams with her in them frequently, I always wanted to reach out after them but I felt that it was silly, but now I really wish I did. She was so young, we barely even have shit figured out in our lives and she's fucking gone. What the fuck. 

I remember hiding in her closet playing pokemon together, I remember running around the outside of her house making up stories and fantasy worlds, I remember having christmas at my house and her and I feverishly talking about what we got in my room, I remember our sleepovers together and how we would try to stay up past midnight, I remember how we joined the chess club together in elementary school so we could hang out together even more. I remember so much and I'm scared I'm going to forget it all, I don't want to forget her.

I've been in and out of sobbing over the past couple hours, I feel restless, I feel super anxious, I hate this so fucking much.

1136,I feel great about a situation that just happened and want to get it out,"I had a friend post on Facebook about mental health and that she wanted to prove that someone is always listening. When I read her post I just broke down and cried for hours. 

I have never seen anyone post something like that before and it hit me hard. I found I wanted to thank her so much for that simple post but didn't know how. Outside of professionals I have only ever been able to talk to one friend about my anxiety and the thought of actually letting her know was too much. Eventually I thought about a different situation where my counselor suggested I write a letter to a someone about how I felt even if I never give it to that person it could help me process my thoughts.

So I sat down and wrote a thank you note. After I got done I still had the strong desire to let her know, and I somehow decided the best way to get her the card I had wrote would be to send it with some flowers. So I went to a local florist and picked a small bouquet of flowers out, had them attach my card and paid them to deliver it all to her work. 

Up until I was leaving the florist I don't think I ever actually thought about what I was doing I was on autopilot and doing it because it felt right, but as soon as I walked out my anxiety caught up with me and I started freaking out about what I had just done. What if the florist delivery person had my name on their delivery paperwork and told her who they were from, what if she somehow figured out who had sent them some other way, what if she didn't like them or thought it was weird getting flowers anonymously. My heart was racing for pretty much constantly and I was always checking Facebook to see if she had posted anything. 

When she finally posted a picture of the flowers on Facebook it was probably the biggest moment of relief and happiness I have felt it a long time. She said thank you to whoever gave her the flowers, that she felt 'blessed' and that she was always there. 

I don't think I have felt this good about anything I have done in a long time and I just felt like I needed to share it with everyone. I still can't believe I did what I did without overthinking everything like I normally do and that it turned out so well. 

I know this was a long post, so if you made it this far, thank you.

1137,A little tip that helped me a lot,"You can not let having anxiety be a part of your identity. If you do, you won't be able to enjoy the better days. If you feel happy your first thought will be ""I'm not anxious"" and not ""I'm happy"". You will always bring it back to anxiety and then you know the rest. Being anxious makes us over think these things.

It's very hard for me to look at people in the eye and I just don't know what do with myself when it comes to body language and gestures.

1140,Why does the expectation of finding a job send me spiraling?,"Is there something wrong with me?


Particularly if the job is full time.


I've worked a full time job before and although I was great at what I did, was paid well and found the job mind numbingly boring at times, I hated going 5 days per week for 8+ hours.


Every morning, I would question why I even woke up and didn't die in my sleep. Never wanted to go to bed because I didn't want tomorrow to happen.


Hated my weekends because I knew I'd never get the mental rest I needed, and they'd just fly by anyway.


Didn't have enough time or energy after work to engage in any of my hobbies or personal projects, or give my sick dog the attention he needed.


But when I was laid off, I was relieved. Relieved I had that freedom back to dedicate all my time towards my responsibilities and not feel overwhelmed. 


I can't continue to live like this, however  (not earning any income). Although I feel really passionate and proud of the mobile application I've spent 3 months working on while unemployed, I have to sacrifice that joy and passion for another mind numbing, demotivating, soul crushing full time job for some corporation. 


I don't think I'm cut out for this world because I can't handle a job like everyone else. I get burned out and overstimulated too easily. 


You can't survive and support yourself without money. Guys, I'm not lazy. My work ethic is great. Even at my last position, I outperformed in most of my tasks. But that didn't stop me from thinking about jumping on the tracks during my commute everyday. I'm not suicidal, but I'd rather die than continue living this way. 


I spoke about this with my psychologist, and I'm not sure if she understands the extent of what I'm going through.

How do I do this without abandoning my problems? I have no money, I've been forced to move back in with my mum. I haven't had a job in over a year, Christmas is coming up and my suicidal thoughts have been getting increasingly stronger and it scares me.  

Only one of those things are in my head. Letting go of my anxiety of these problems feels like I'm pretending they aren't problems. I'm stuck between wanting to give up so bad and to just ""let go"", and knowing that I still have this giant mess that needs cleaning up or else it becomes someone else's problem. I feel pathetic complaining but these things are real for me.  


I would love to get a job, I've been trying so hard, but the anxiety of working makes it hard to even look for work at times.  
I would love to move out again, but nobody wants to rent to someone on taxpayers' money.  
I would love to buy my family nice gifts for Christmas but I'm so pathetic that I can't even take care of myself.  


How am I supposed to let go when the idea of pretending everything is okay seems so self-destructive. I've tried it before, I ended up quitting my job and moving out with friends. It only made my life even worse as it has now come back around to bite me on the ass.   


Honestly, I'd love nothing more than to simply let go and let my life go its course as my whole world crashes down around me. I'd love to just go batshit crazy and end up in a hospital where nobody cares if you don't have a job or stable home. But doing so would cost those around me. The other option would be to kill myself but I'm afraid that people I love would follow me. I'm stuck in this prison of a life, forced to work to pay for a life that I don't even want to live. How the fuck am I supposed to let that go? How do you tell yourself that nothing can hurt you when you are already in so much pain?   


Maybe I've just forgotten how to live without anxiety. Sometimes I think anxiety is the only thing stopping my depression from taking over. Maybe my ""fight or flight"" is actually working to keep me alive, but torturing me in the process. Tell me what's worth more, a peaceful mind with no will to live, or an anxious mind that's too scared to live or die?

1151,Best advice my doctor ever gave me,"I had a really bad time last Christmas, I was hopeless so I went to see my doctor. She simply said, ""What worries you, why are you afraid?"". Well I said the same thing I have told her like hundreds of times ""I will lose my mind any second, I will go crazy and lose sense of reality."" Her next response has kept me going still, ""You are afraid of something that you have no control of. You're afraid you're going crazy? Then go crazy, now. See? You can't do anything about it so why worry about it. It's 'only anxiety' and you know it. It will feel bad, really bad, but it will not kill you, it will not make you lose control. Don't try to fight it, you're only making it worse. Let anxiety come to you and don't be afraid of it. The moment you stop being afraid, the moment you will be free.

English is not my first language so I'm sorry if you can't make sense of my comment, my point is that just learn to face your fears, cliche I know, but it really helped me and I hope it can help some one else.",22,2016-05-07 02:26:11 EDT-0400

1155,I wrote a letter to myself to read when I'm feeling stuck in my anxiety. Thought I'd share part of it.,"All you can do is try to be in the moment. Do the guided meditations that help you be in your body. Remember who you are. Find your strong self, your whole self. You're a mountain. Feel your feet on the floor, and the breath entering your nostrils and filling your lungs. There is a self beyond your thoughts and feelings. You're always there. The only way out of this is in you, it's not in any external place. You can't find it anywhere else.

You're always there, and I love you either way. I love you when you get caught up in your thoughts, when you are stressed, when your stomach hurts, when you feel whole, when you feel empty, when you feel grief, when you feel shame. I love you when you're anxious, when you have panic attacks, and when you're super relaxed. I love you when you can't concentrate and also when you get in the zone. I love you when you're being mean to yourself and when you practice self compassion. I love you when all you can handle is watching TV all day. I love you when you're sad and when you're happy and when you're excited and when you're exhausted and when you're scared and when you're brave. I love that you are sensitive and feel things deeply. It's what makes you who you are, it's what makes you able to make the work that you do. 

You're doing the best you can with what you have.

You're allowed to feel however you're feeling. 

You are loved. You are enough. You. Are. Enough. Just as you are. You are human. You are imperfect. Forgive yourself. Hug your heart. It's OK. ",20,2016-05-03 06:35:00 EDT-0400
1156,"Cannabis free for a month today, after 6+ years of daily use.","And i feel fantastic.  

I use to smoke 4+joints a day to ease my anxiety.  I found that the more I smoked the more numb I became.  

After saying 'im going to quit after this last one'  for the last couple of years,  I finally did it and couldn't of done it without the support from my girlfriend.  Im so lucky she stuck by me. 

For anyone else struggling with long term cannabis abuse,  the first couple of weeks are hell but i promise the anxiety eases and you can tackle problems head on without it.  

Also started vaping on a low level of nicotine and found this helped massively in me quiting.  

I'm not at all anti weed.  To be honest if i could I would still be using but i believe it causes bigger anxiety in the long run for people who already suffer from it. 

Just abit of a rant really =)

1157,"It took 12 years, but I did it.","I have dealt with on again, off again anxiety and depression for 20 years. I was on paxil about 14 years ago and stopped taking it after about a year. For awhile I was happy about the decision, despite the constant struggle.

The past 5 years have been especially tough and it's been a downward spiral. Every time I told myself I'd call the doctor, I'd chicken out and push the thought in the back of my mind.

Then this weekend happened. My oldest daughter is away from me for the first time since she was born. I'm terribly sad and anxious about this and the house has been insanely quiet.

When we got home from dropping her off, the neighbor stopped by and informed us that his dog chased our cat up a tree, and the cat fell and died. I loved this cat more than I knew possible. He and I were best buddies. He was great with my kids. He was fearless, an adventurer. He likes to go for walks with me to pick up the mail, and sounded like a tiger when he walked. I'm so devastated and have barely stopped crying since we found out on Sunday.

The worst part is that my daughter doesn't know yet. We don't want to ruin her trip.

That said, this was the last straw. The cat dying gave me awful depressive thoughts and anxiety beyond control. 

I must have picked up the phone 10 times yesterday but finally I did it. I went in, cried at the doctor, and got a prescription for zoloft. After 12 years trying to deal with this shit on my own, I'm ready to deal with some of the side affects if it means that I can quiet down my never-ending anxiety and depression.",24,2016-05-03 18:23:41 EDT-0400
1158,Does anyone have a really high tolerance for stress until it gets to the breaking point?,"I seem to be good at with dealing with stress until it gets to be too much. But up to that point I don't seem any different. I mean I'll say to people you know I'm really stressed about this or whatever, but people don't really take it seriously because I don't seem any different from how I normally am when I say it. There is no gradual change from my normal self to worse, it seems to be normal, then a gigantic panic attack, however it takes a lot to get me to the point. I think it may be that I just stuff all of my feelings away until I can't and it all pours out. For example all year I have really half assed it in school, and now that finals are coming up and I literally haven't paid attention in school for the past two months I have no idea what I'm going to do. I'm not visually upset yet, but I feel it coming. Like the rumble of thunder from an approoaching storm in the distance. I dont know what to do.",23,2016-05-04 06:25:01 EDT-0400

1161,"Ever feel like anxiety is trendy, now?","I've dealt with anxiety and ptsd all my life. I've always hidden it for fear it would drive friends and loved ones away. I've only broken down in front of my own parents 3 times in my life. Now that being open about mental health is accepted, I have one friend who has diagnosed herself and one with a shiny new diagnoses. Because I never broke down in front of them and was never public about my issues, I'm seen as the unbreakable friend that understands them. All they want to do is talk to me about their anxiety and unload on me, but when I need someone to talk to they get incredibly angry and short with me, saying I'm making them ""anxious"". If I need to get away from them for my own health and need ""quiet"" they won't let me escape and just keep unloading. Is there anyone else going through this right now?

1162,"I have to run errands and apply for jobs in a new country, alone; and I really dont want to leave the house","My SO and I just moved to Spain. We just moved into our apartment yesterday. He already got a job and he left for work 10 minutes ago. In the last week that we've been here he's walked me to all the recruitment fairs and waited outside while I applied. Any errands or anything we need to do we do together. 

So now hes at work and my anxiety is through the roof because it means I have to walk into town by myself, and I have to walk around to all the bars and restaurants alone and approach staff and hand in a CV and talk to people without shitting my pants. 

The heating in the house hasnt been activated yet so it was freezing last night and now I have a stuffed nose and sore throat and id much rather lay in bed and sleep/rest.

Like mine includes gum, lotion, a small pack of stickers, a pen, a small journal, my Xanax, and a small Dalmatian beanie baby that I found at an antique store, and an action figure. 

I find that if I focus on messing with my Dalmatian or my action figure it takes my mind off of what I'm panicking about. I write down what I'm thankful for in my journal and when and where my panic attack started. Lotion to focus on my hands and gum. Xanax is my last resort, of course. 

Do you guys have something like this too? Share your kits, post pictures! I'll post a picture of mine later. It might give ideas to others to make their own kits!",36,2016-05-02 00:50:20 EDT-0400
1164,Anxiety and Gut Issues (let's do some supportive ranting!),"I know I can't possibly be the only one... In the last couple of years my anxiety has led to the following physical issues:

• severe nausea
• not-norovirus but it sure feels that way for a few hours (aka puking and...the other thing)
• 2-3 hours to finish a simple meal (thankfully this inability to physically eat lasted only a couple months)
• possible IBS starting up now

I feel so bad for my GI system! And hate feeling any of these symptoms in general. Thinking of trying probiotics again (used them for IBS a decade ago before I went vegetarian and the IBS stopped) & it helps.

This mind/body connection is so crazy frustrating isn't it? You try so hard to improve your mental health, but it's a long process, and your physical health just doesn't seem to have to patience to wait! ;p

Hugs to you all and anyone who is suffering! Do you have your own problematic GI/stress relationship?",33,2016-05-04 18:53:36 EDT-0400
1165,I hate feeling normal again after a panic attack,"Tonight I had the most incredible panic attack, with chest pains and constant urges to hurt myself. After taking a Valium, most of the symptoms subsided other than the chest pains, so in the middle of work I ended up having a supervisor drive me to the hospital.

By then, the chest pains had stopped and I was feeling largely 'normal'. It seemed impossible to imagine I had felt the way I did only a short time before (and had been feeling that way for several hours).

As much as I hate my anxiety, I still hate how stupid and ashamed I feel afterwards when everything returns to normal (however briefly that will last).",8,2016-05-03 16:04:19 EDT-0400

1167,Quick Tip To Get More Social,How do you force yourself to be social? You get a job were you have to talk to people all the time. One of the best things I ever did for my social anxiety was to get a job as a cashier at Panera bread. It gave me the opportunity to talk with people all the time. Just forced myself to talk about the weather or what was currently going on in the moment. I became better as time went on. By forcing yourself into this position it will help you become more social. It was so freaking hard the first six months. The amount of anxiety I felt was so over whelming. But eventually when you do something so many times you get bored. That is the trick. Do it enough times so you get bored instead of anxious. Hope this tip helps someone. Good luck and stay strong! Love this Reddit! :),19,2016-05-03 03:36:55 EDT-0400

My brain is a mess, i feel like i'm floating in the middle of the ocean, disconnected from everyone and everything. I don't know how much more of this i can take. I hate it. I hate to always fail at simple things. I hate that i can't do anything right, that no one gives a shit and that i won't survive this nightmare unless a mircale happens. The fact that the one person who said she would always be there for me, isn't, makes me so sad but not suprised. I was never good enough for her anyway, i knew that deep down but i will go back, i always do because being with her, even tho it's destructive as hell, it's better than being completely alone.

But now, suddenly, they're gone and I still have anxiety but its... different. I dont know how to explain it. I feel like I dont know who I am. I feel like I'm on a different plane of existence than everyone else. I don't feel human. I also can't seem to think rationally anymore. My common sense is gone, I cant remember anything, I can't focus on anything (I had trouble focusing before too but now its basically completely gone). I'm having trouble telling right from wrong as well. I just feel so inhuman. And I cant stop hating myself. I feel so disgusted by myself and my existence. I've never felt this much hatred and disgust before. I saw a video of myself the other day (it was taken the same day) and I looked so ALIVE in the video. I was moving around and eating and reacting to my environment, like everyone else, but in reality I dont feel real or alive at all. I feel dead. I dont feel my environment. Everything is so dimmed and dull, nothing feels real. I think I'm really losing my mind this time. I'm so scared I don't know what to do, I dont wanna become insane. ",14,2016-05-01 08:14:02 EDT-0400
1174,"Sort of confused, I think my counselor ditched me because I decided to try medication?","I had my first counselor appointment 2-3 weeks ago. I had set up an appointment (today) with a psychiatrist, followed immediately by my second appointment with my counselor. She had told me at the first appointment, that I should tell my psychiatrist I'm not interested in medications. However, the psychiatrist convinced me to try Wellbutrin, although I'm still a little on the fence. 




When I went to my counselor appointment right after, I told her about the Wellbutrin, and then at the end of the hour, she opened her calendar, and flipped to August, and said something along the lines of, ""so I think you should call around early August to schedule an appointment. If you end up deciding to go off Wellbutrin you can call to come in earlier, or if you feel like you need to come in earlier, you can as well.""




I'm really confused, I had been told generally people have meetings every 2-3 weeks, and that the psychiatrist prefers people to keep seeing the counselors even with meds. I feel like I decided to try meds and she pushed me 3-4 months away. I know meds won't keep my family from being a huge stressor in my life, along with school. 




Is this common? Is seeing a psychiatrist AND a counselor something that's just not common?  With my personality, I tend not to open up to people I don't know, so if I only see her 4 times a year, I'm going to get nothing out of this. Very frustrated.

The recent example of this is when I called my friend and his jealous girlfriend answered. She called me derogatory names and threatened to press charges against me for harassing my friend, that sort of thing. I know none of it's true and she has no way to do any actual harm to me, but it profoundly upset me. Encounters like this bring on shaking, nausea, diarrhea, hyper vigilance, crying fits, insomnia and nightmares, all lasting several days.  
  
It's sometimes even a much smaller trigger, or one I don't really pick up on at all, but I feel absolutely terrified nonetheless.

1183,I feel like I've been in the fight or flight response for almost 3 days.,"I'm so worried. I have some sort of flu which just isn't leaving. I developed it last Thursday, had a uti as well which I was taking antibiotics for. Felt a little better Monday, but woke up at 7am after 4 hours sleep and couldnt get back to sleep. Then this is when I just went downhill. Monday evening I got this horrible feeling in my sinuses and throat, like something had swelled up inside my nose. I didn't have a blocked nose, it felt like it was behind my nose almost. So I tried to sleep and breathe through my mouth. I got this horrible burning sensation and an incredibly dry mouth, I felt like I couldn't breathe at all now. Spent the next few hours panicking completely because I couldn't breathe. I then had a coughing fit because of the flu, and I was choking. I couldn't breathe at all. Thought I was going to die. I woke my mum up and she got worried and phoned the paramedic, he arrived and said I could breathe fine, and my temp was a little high but that's all. I then went to my doctors office, she said I was fine but have a respiratory infection (cold/flu) and gave me antibiotics which doesn't make sense considering they're useless for viral infections. Anyway I felt like I was breathing in hot and thick air ever since Monday night. I feel like my heart is racing 24/7 and I'm unable to concentrate on absolutely nothing other than the fact I am feeling this way. I feel this lump in my throat when I breathe in or swallow, and I've been unable to sleep. I was literally awake 56 hours and each time I'd start to go, I'd make this noise and jolt up awake. I finally slept at 11am yesterday until 5pm. Feeling was still there! All day yesterday I spent feeling panicky again, worrying over why I don't feel normal. I also feel extremely disoriented, heavy eyes, dizzy, blurred vision and I can't focus on anything. Last night I got to sleep at 7am, it was a huge struggle to sleep and I was freaking out massively over why I'm not sleeping even though my body is so exhausted it feels like collapsing. 

I am just so fucking tired of this, I feel like I'm not even myself. I feel my life ended on Monday evening, because I haven't felt right within my mind since. I'm so tired in the eyes but I just can't seem to sleep or focus on anything. I have been inside a week because of this sickness, and its just not improving. I don't know if it's because I'm sick or because I'm experiencing some sort of long panic attack. I haven't been diagnosed with anxiety, but before this I often wondered if I had it. I've never felt this sort of panic before though. Can anyone help me?",14,2016-02-25 18:15:00 EST-0500
1184,I found out my fiance's parents want him to break up with me because of my student debt...feel even worse :/,"long story short I have a lot of student debt and still have 2 more years to go until I start making any real money in my field. It IS a lot of debt, and I was very up front with him from the beginning. I told him I don't expect anyone to help me, but I was realistic and said if you want kids sooner rather than later I will need financial help with this.
My fiance makes about 50k a year and I make very little right now becuase Im just starting out but once I get experience I can command at least 65-70k minimum.
Ive struggled a LOT with feeling like a failure becuase I took out so much loans to start with and I changed my career becuase the first one wasn't my passion and wouldn't have made a lot of money anyway. Its been incredibly hard. I can't even afford to fix my cracked teeth or get a nightgaurd that I need to prevent more teeth from cracking.
I work all the time and study every night and Im so fucking exhausted.
The stress HAS been getting to my fiance though. He grew up with parents who were very well off and I don't think he knows how to handle this. He has decided to get therapy becuase he has developed anxiety and I fully support it. I feel so bad becuase I know his life would be so much easier without me. But he says Im worth it. He says he knows this will be better in two years once I make more money and he doesn't want to miss out on me because he wasn't patient. Either way, I wont let him marry me until my position changes financially. I do NOT want to trap him.
I found out his mom (and possibly his dad) thinks he should just break up wtih me. They think that while Im a good person, my past mistakes are just going to bring him down. This really hurts. I dont know how to forgive them, and I can't even look them in the eye anymore.
The worst part?? His dad supported his mom entirely through med school. The only fucking reason they have money is because he took financial care of her while she was incurring debt. I realize the situation is a little different here, but it feels so fucking hypocritical.
I just feel so bad and so ashamed and like a failure. All Im doing is trying my hardest and to hear that I dont have their support kills me. Recenlty she messaged me on fb saying my status changed and she wondered if anything important changed. Idk what she was talking about but I feel like she was hoping we broke up!! Idk what to do :(",27,2016-02-25 04:10:33 EST-0500

1190,"Yesterday I was scared for my life. I was alone and terrified. I set my pride aside and called a friend just to have a distraction. Today I feel great, and I want to be that friend who is that distraction to someone in need.","First off, I'm not putting this out there for attention. I'm not putting this out there for pity. That's not who I am or what I'm about. But I am putting this out there simply because it's not talked about enough. It's ignored. People feel ashamed talking about it. The stigma is real and harsh. But I'm doing my part to help reduce the stigma by talking about it. The more you talk about it, the more you realize YOU ARE NOT ALONE. I have made new friends, and grown closer to others because of this.

I had a TERRIBLE day yesterday. One that rivaled my traumatizing summer of short term disability, major med changes, and SEVERE mood swings. You know how sometimes you wake up and you just KNOW its going to be a bad day? That was me yesterday. It took me about 2 hours to get out of bed. I went to work, but hour by hour I got progressively worse. The negative and racing thoughts were too much. 

I did what I do on rough days. I take an index card and write out every half hour with a check box. 1:30 to 2:00, 2:00 to 2:30, etc. Every half hour I get through my work day I get to check a box off. It gives me the feeling of accomplishment and helps me focus. I make my judgement call at my first break. Can I keep going? Can I make it to lunch? Ok. Lets keep going. Lets make it to lunch and make another judgement call then.

I had two days this month that this worked for me. It's so silly, but it's huge for me when I can make it through a work day when I'm mentally and emotionally just ready to quit. When all I want to do is go make a blanket fort, grab my cats and coloring books and just shut out the world. 

Yesterday I lost.

Yesterday I called off work at 7pm with only three hours left in my shift. I simply couldn't do it. I was overcome with so much guilt, but I had to do it. I HAVE to put my health and well being before my job, otherwise I wont be able to DO my job. But the guilt just made it worse. I know, ""that's what it's there for,"" but I hold myself to a high standard. To be there for my team, to be there for my customers. When I call off, I feel like I let everyone down. And even though I do it to help myself, sometimes it only makes it worse. Its a vicious cycle.

As terrible as my night was, as terrified as I was, I found comfort. I had my cats, I had support group of friends who are there for me no matter what, and I had my boyfriend (last, but absolutely not least.)

There's really nothing anyone can do for someone when they're feeling this way, except to be there. I know the supporting people must feel absolutely helpless, but I want them to know that they ARE helping. Just being there, being a distraction, being on the other end of a phone call, putting your arms around me and just letting me cry into your shirt and babble on about insignificant nonsense that is COMPLETELY illogical.... that's what I need. Your time, your support, your love.

That's all anyone can really do. Love and support, be there, and make time. It makes all the difference in the world. The rest is out of your control.

Thank you to my friends, family, coworkers, and especially my boyfriend or constantly being there. ALWAYS being there. Never complaining about having to 'deal' with me. Without you, I wouldn't be where I am right now. 

And I beg of you. All of you. If you are suffering in silence, raise your voice. Don't be alone. Being alone is scary sometimes, and can be dangerous. Reach out to someone. Reach out to a loved one, a coworker, a supervisor, anyone. 

Call your doctor. Sometimes it takes more than just antidepressants, and sometimes the antidepressants make it worse. Ask for a recommendation to see a psychiatrist. See what options you have in your health insurance or any sort of benefits from your employer. Some employers offer EAP (Employee Assistance Program) that will give you a set amount of health care appointments for free. Thats how I started my road to recovery. I started with free EAP therapy appointments. 

Please do not sit around and let depression and anxiety slowly kill you. Do something about it. Take action. It's never too late. It might take EVERY LAST BIT OF ENERGY you have. But I know you have it in you. You can do it. And you will be glad you did. It might be the fight of your life, but in the long run, it will make you stronger and you will feel better. 

I love every single one of you, and I want you all to be happy, and enjoy life. Life is worth LIVING, not just EXISTING.

Also, if any of you need someone. PM me. I'll listen to you.

But I can't stop thinking that maybe I messed something up, or someone didn't have a good time, or that none of those people will want to hang out with me again. 

It is occurring to me that I feel some variation on this after every time I'm successfully very social for a day or two. Does anyone else get this? How do I convince myself my friends still all like me?",23,2016-02-22 18:46:58 EST-0500
1194,I'm having a total breakdown,[deleted],11,2016-02-24 07:02:44 EST-0500
1195,I HATE being stared at.,"I had to get an ultrasound for my neck the other day and in the waiting room there was this lady who kept staring at my arm. She was so lucky that I was only sat down for about a minute before I was called in. I felt like going mental on her and I was on the border of having a panic attack. I've never had someone stare out my scars so much, especially after I had made eye contact with her twice. Like, wtf? Seriously lady? Did you not get the memo? You look at me as if I had just fucking murdered someone. Do you think I want you or other people constantly looking at me? Do you think I enjoy being stared at like I'm some kind of freak? No, but I'm not covering them up when it's scorching hot outside and the weather is humid. Have some damn decency for fucks sakes. And before anyone asks, I wasn't imagining anything. My sister saw it and even told me as well. 

Ugh. I hate my scars so much. It's not to do with how they look though, it's more to do with the fact that they bring me so much attention. I'm not trying to seek it and I sure as hell don't want it. I don't want anyone's sympathies, I don't want anyone's eyes on them, and I don't want to feel like some deranged monster every time I walk into a room. I just want to be treated like any other person. If I could go back in time, then I'd cut in some place different. I made a mistake. It's my fault. I get it. But I don't want to be reminded of it every day.

There was also this incident that occurred about 5 minutes after my appointment. We were walking back to the car and there was this guy on his bike. My mother points out that he's staring at me and so I turn to look. I look and I see the biggest smile on his face. We held each other's gazes until he had passed behind me for a few seconds (still grinning at me very intensely). It freaked me out and I began panicking because I thought he was laughing at my scars or something. Well, he wasn't, because I was hugging my jumper and my scars were hidden. I asked my Mum why he was smiling and I asked if my scars were showing and she said they weren't. I'm a bit slow sometimes and I hardly get out of the house but I eventually realized why (I'm sure you can all too), it just caught me off guard. 

This isn't a humble brag and I'm not trying to say anything about my appearance at all, I just honestly and truly HATE being stared at for whatever reason (most of the time), whether it's good or bad. It makes my anxiety go into overdrive and I just can't handle it, I get so overwhelmed. I realize that I can't control people's actions and that's it's only realistic for things like this to happen, but how the hell do you deal with it? I have a prescription for Oxazepam but I don't like relying on it all the time for when I need to go out. Can anyone relate?",6,2016-02-27 06:02:28 EST-0500
1196,I (30 F) think I need help,"For as long as I can remember I have been scared. 

When I was child if my parents ever went to date night I had fear they would die on the way home. I very vividly remember pacing the hallway at like 7 years old so scared I'd never see them again. 

I raised in a very strict southern baptist household, Christians believe that the only way to heaven was to be ""be saved"" by asking forgiveness for their sins and accepting Jesus in their hearts. I did this, as I was expected too. But I was always scared I did it wrong, what I wasn't fully repentant? What if that one sin made it all go away and I had to do it again? What if Jesus wasn't listening? I was always scared of Hell, dying, and the rapture. 

I no longer believe as a christian and am an atheist, it was amazing the relief that has caused. but sometimes I fear I'm wrong, what if there really is a god and I'm going to go to hell now. 

It takes me forever to leave the house in the morning. I have to make sure all the small appliances are unplugged, check the door (try it 2 sets of 3 times), I have to touch each knob on the stove 3 times. I have to check each door in an order. I have turned around after leaving my house because I couldn't exactly remember if I had checked a door. The other day I stood outside and almost started crying because I wouldn't let myself leave. I knew the door was locked, but I didn't believe myself. Then I thought my dog had gotten outside even though on the way out I remember petting him on the couch. but, what if during the split second I had the door open walking out he had gotten out. Even though I couldn't see him...I had to go back inside and check if he was still on the couch. He was. 

My husband asked me if I had turned the coffee pot off because it was off when he had gotten his last cup of coffee. In my mind, even though he said it was off, was that the coffee pot was still one and it was going to explode and the house would burn down and our dog would die or get loose. I almost left work, which is 20 minutes away, and went home to check. My heart rate elevated, I almost started crying, I tried to calm myself and tell myself I was over reacting but it didn't work. 

Noise causes me stress and anxiety. People who smack, slurp, pop gum, whistle, scrape their teeth on the fork, sniffle, repetitive noises and movements like a leg shaking. all of those things, and more cause me stress. To the point it's hard for me to focus on what I need to and can only focus on what is bothering me. I've lashed out verbally at my mother and brother, I've physically grabbed a pen from a coworker because she was tapping it constantly. I will stare at people, or mimic whatever they are doing. 

If I come home from work it's hard for me to relax when I know there are dishes in the sink. I have to check that the toilet seat is down because what if the dog drinks out of it and he gets sick?

It's hard for me to make decisions because I'm always scared it wrong, or will disappoint someone. I'm scared to do things because I don't think I can accomplish it. Like studying for my GMAT, I don't start because I'm scared of it.  

These are things I deal with almost daily. Not to mention my health anxiety. 

I had cancer and everything that is weird in my body is automatically cancer again. I'm high risk for another cancer and am constantly scared of my preventative screenings coming back positive. 

These symptoms did not start after I got cancer, I've been like this for years. It has gotten worse recently though. Well I feel like it has. I haven't done the best job of tracking it. 

I don't know if it's anxiety, or OCD, or just over stress. I am going to see my therapist soon and have not expressed these things to her previously and will. I just wanted to see if these were symptoms that any of you experience. I've been previously diagnosed with depression and was on medication. I exercise regularly, though I have only recently been able to start again due to recovery from cancer treatment. ",28,2016-02-26 19:30:49 EST-0500

1198,Job search anxiety feels like it's killing me.,"It's just a little task.  i'm putting up a profile on my alumni networking website.  I have to fight through feelings that I'm not as good as other people. I don't have any social media accounts and presenting myself online is horrifying to me.  I'm just breaking down this electronic form into very small tasks.  If there are 15 fields to fill and I just confront one everyday it will be done in a little over two weeks.  That's a long time to some people, but it's all I can handle now.  

I have to do this.  I have to find a job.  If I don't I'll be a penniless 41 yr old female who will come to ruin.  I have no husband, no children, no career due to PTSD.  This is high stakes.  I need help, and I need to take baby steps to get through this.  This fear has crippled me and it's hard starting to tolerate the distress long enough to accomplish something.
