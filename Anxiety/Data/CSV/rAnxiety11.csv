8,"I seem to be utterly obsessed with practicing imaginary conversations with verbally combative people in my head, always trying to figure out how I can ""win"" against them...","I am a very imaginative person, able to deliberately visualize and lose myself in an inner world of manipulating objects, colors, sounds, textures, etc in my mind.  I can play with them like some kind of futuristic, holographic CAD system, changing and testing things out until I figure out a good methodology. That means when I finally create something new with my hands, it can sometimes like someone with a lot of experience actually did the work.  (I've unfortunately never made a career out of that ability, though).

I guess having a multi-dimensional imagination like that is like a double-edged sword.   I am slowly starting to realize that a lot of my ""processor cycles"" (I like using computer terminology to describe my brain) are burned up on imagining conversations with abusive people.  I seem to be constantly practicing, practicing, practicing strategies on what I'd say to them.  

If they say X to me, I figure out a clever Y verbal strategy for it.  Then I keep mentally refining my strategy as I continue to drive, to attempt to do housework, or whatever is in front of me.  This, of course, screws up my ability to sleep.  

I've always battled this inner battle as just part of my inner mental background noise.  I've never really considered it's implications in the front of my brain before.  Kinda like being a fish raised in polluted water trying to consider what clear, healthy water might actually feel like.

In a way, much of that effort is wasted, because I never thought to write down my snappiest, best verbal comebacks and defenses.  I know I have come up with some pretty clever stuff in the past and it's wasted with the fact that my memory just can't remember all those strategies.  That's a hell of a lot of perfectly good ""processor cycles"" wasted on trying to fight verbally/emotionally abusive people which my anxious subconscious constantly conjures up for me to fight.

I am in a relationship, and my very gentle, concerned SO sometimes comments: ""Are you in pain?  You look like you are in pain!""  My responses have been anywhere between being reactively mean/snappish to a confused ""I don't know, I'm just sitting here/washing dishes/etc.""  

It's starting to slooooooowly sink in that there often seems to be a coincidence between when I am in the heat of fighting that mental battle with whenever that feedback is told to me.  

I used to fantasize a lot about physical revenge too, but when I confided to my SO about that, I got feedback that is absolutely not healthy.  So I've mentally toned that down somewhat.  Still not giving it up completely.

The thing is... (a) I don't have any verbal abusive people in my life right now because I've given up having many friends and (b) the rare times when a verbally abusive person DOES come along, they often come up with a verbal tactic I hadn't considered yet.  If they've succeeded in hurting me, that's another fight that keeps running over and over in the back of my brain.

Growing up in a family from hell, you simply don't have much of an emotional feel for what's normal/healthy and ya take so much negative stuff for granted.  

I keep desperately NEEDING to fight this fight inside.  As long as you can keep up the fight, you don't have to accept that you've lost the war.  

I feel like an old soldier of a conquered country.  The battle is gone into history. The abusers from the other side have already have already had their satisfaction from their sadistic game of hurting their POW victim and enjoying his/her cries of pain.  They've already left, laughing and enjoying the physical and mental triumph of crushing the humanity of their victim.   

The old soldier still wants to keep fighting the war, even as he/she is not physically or mentally capable of it anymore.  The old soldier just can't accept that they've already won.  

I'm officially labeled as disabled now because they've won.  I don't want to know this... I don't want to feel this...  if I give up this mental fight, I am going to feel like someone who was brutally raped, mentally speaking.  It would be the ultimate defeat. I don't want to believe it, I don't want to feel it, I don't want to let it sink in to my brain that they've actually, utterly, completely won.  :'-(

Is there anyone else out there who is like this?

(For the record, I've been in therapy for a bunch of years.  My current therapist is amazingly clued and effective but expensive, so I only get to see her maybe once a month at best.)

EDIT: Holy CRAP this was long.  I'm too tired to do a TL;DR, sorry.  
For those who read it, thanks for listening.

EDIT2:  (6 hours later)  A small bit of progress... I felt my subconscious starting one of those accusation dialogs today and instead of engaging in it, I said ""that's your opinion"" and kept going.  I kinda felt like a more mature person in that moment.  I can still feel it happening on a more non-verbal level, but I'll take any progress that I can get.

EDIT3:  A week later...  looks like talking about it has helped me to be able to start noticing the arguments and decide not to engage more and more.  I like being able to talk about my problems here.  :)",10,2011-11-12 19:40:11 EST-0500

10,has anyone ever blanked out while speaking?,"I've had this sudden anxiety problem (or speech problem, I don't know yet) come over me. 

First, in general, it's become more difficult for me to speak verbal around people. Words don't come to me as quickly as before, and I almost stutter at times. 

More concerning however, is that recently, I've been blanking out while speaking to people. I start speaking, and then just freeze up and am unable to converse or speak any further. Anyone have this happen to them.

Any anecdotes would be helpful. I'm going into to see a doc soon.

11,"So r/Anxiety, what do you do for a living?","I've been out of work for months. I got married and had to relocate to the worst job market area in my state. The only open jobs are for managers and salespeople. Obviously not something I am able to do.

[Thanks for all the replies. After getting yet another application shot down yesterday I needed some encouragement from others with anxiety problems.

13,How do you deal with people who don't understand?,"A little background here I'm 22, a girl, go to school full time and live with my parents. Not a big deal they aren't cramping my style and I have a good relationship with them. I have had problems with my anxiety since I was five, but I would say just four years ago I was able finally call it anxiety. I'm good 80% of the time, deal with it on my own, don't let it affect my daily life, tell no one. No big deal. Now the 20% of the time it's either debilitating and I just need to stay home, or I need to have some one talk to me. It's just nice to either be in my comfort zone or have some one know how I'm feeling. 

The problem here is my mom. She doesn't understand, and is not really trying to. Many times if I tell her I am feeling anxious she asks me why. Cool, good question but sometimes I just am and she doesn't get that. Or she'll tell me to get a hold of myself, again, not something I didn't know needed to be done, and not the most constructive answer. I've been to therapy twice and feel that I know how to cope for the most part, it's just some times too much. No big deal in my opinion, I'm not perfect, sometimes I lose. I just don't know how to convey to my mother what I am feeling, she things I can just snap out of it by telling myself to stop. She just doesn't get it, to the point of getting pissed off at me when I need to just relax. I have never been good at explaining this to people. 

How do you guys explain things like this to those close to you?",10,2011-11-02 06:14:39 EDT-0400

15,Update from daily panic attack guy! (Post Doctor visit),"[Sweet Jesus finally relief.](http://i.imgur.com/lasCT.png)

I'll be brief, lol.  Given my drug abuse history, my Doctor decided that [Vistaril](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmedhealth/PMH0000796/) for the anxiety and [Celexa](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmedhealth/PMH0001041/) for the depression is where we're gonna start.  I've heard of neither of these drugs, but I trust my Doctor implicitly.  Within 45 minutes of taking the Vistaril, I FINALLY FIANLLY OH DEAR LORD FINALLY felt calm.

I know this is only the first step in a long line of them, but I wanted to let you all know that I'm doing much better.  Just the act of typing out the posts I've made helped a lot, but I've received nothing but love and support from everyone, I can't thank you all enough.

28 years I tried it by myself.  Now I can finally begin to get better.",12,2011-11-28 20:51:01 EST-0500
16,How to cope with being alone?,"I've been without close friends for what's approaching to 2 years now. I had a panic attack in high school, lost my job, connection to my friends, potential love interests. 

On weekends I'm alone from 5-8. Even when my parents are out my mind starts to go through the motions. It's as if my body is telling me that something isn't right, that I'm capable of much better, which only serves to raise my anxiety. 

My hypocritical thought patterns want me to feel like I'm wanted and have friends, but I don't want to burden anyone with my awkwardness at the same time.

It's still about a week away before I meet my new psychiatrist. Thing is, it'll still be a couple of weeks before I get put on medication, and a few more for my body to adapt.

I don't know what to do with myself in the meantime. I mean I could indulge into Skyrim and other video games, but I'd just waste the day away. It's not real, and at the very least it's not something like BF3 or COD where I can throw on a headset and talk.",12,2011-11-28 00:45:00 EST-0500

20,"""Once you have a piece of normality to hang onto, it motivates you to keep trying"" -UnsettledBrute","Just thought I'd share something I saw as motivational.  Good on ya, OP.

Also, here's [the original comment](http://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/m1a80/i_want_out/)'s source.",1,2011-11-06 10:27:59 EST-0500
21,I have no life. ,"For the better part of the latter half of my life (I am 18 now) i've always tended to avoid people, and as a result, never really learned to interact around them. I used to have very strong physical symptoms that were a clear mark of anxiety (fast heartbeat, inability to speak, etc.) back at around 14-15, however I now never get them.

However, I do still avoid people, and I suspect that it's those symptoms that i've been really avoiding all this time enough for me to never get into a position into which they can manifest. I'm never internally anxious, but I regularly do things like wait in line for half an hour, only to leave at the last possible moment because I didn't want to talk to the person at the counter. I get a sort of euphoric thrill from walking away after that, as well as a tinge of disappointment, but somewhat exhilarated that my suspicions that that was what I was going to do was verified. Sometimes I wait in lines anyway even though I don't wish to buy anything because i've arrived too early for class and don't want to be the only one there. And then I realize how stupid the entire endeavor is, and realize that it's kind of sad. Neither do I attend any social functions (I stopped long ago) and do not wish to. Although I do wish I could enjoy them (perhaps as someone vastly different from myself).


Part of this is my fear of unpredictability. When I try to do something new I like to visualize what I am going to be doing so I may be sure of how I would act in the situation. I've tried seeking help at my college's counselling services, however, I literally have no idea how I would make the jump from going in the door to meeting someone who I have no idea of. I've circled the building numerous times trying to get up the courage to walk in the door, only to leave and walk away later on. They do have a phone, but I can't work up calling them for the same reasons.

I talk to myself a lot of times and make up stories to keep me company. Most of the time they're based on people I meet (or rather, see, I can never get to talk to them due to my lack of confidence and awkwardness), and they often end up as a replacement for what normally would be loneliness. They're utterly predictable of course, since I made them up after all, and any anxiety is naturally absent from them, but every real confrontation runs contrary to my expectations since there is a certain element of the real that triggers a flight response.  

Sometimes I don't see why I should ever bother, when I can simply populate my mind with imaginary people who I can control, and entertain myself further with books and videogames. I feel like I can just slowly wither away doing so, knowing I can just off myself should I ever get into a position where there is no longer anything to sustain me in real life. I consider it sometimes, though i've made no concrete plans, but knowing I would have no compulsion in doing so. 


The only two things I have that would normally be a plus would be the fact that my parents have more than enough to financially support me for life (with the implication of course that I would never have to work for myself, and never get into a position of absolute poverty that i'd have to work my ass up off and be forced to commune with society) and that i'm relatively intelligent, which only makes me feel more stupid for not being able to act or think when faced with unpredictable situations, and ensuring that unless I deliberately sabotage my studies i'd never fail.

It's the latter or an attempted failed suicide attempt that i've paradoxically considered as my rational options in my situation to better myself in the long run, enough so that i'd get help without my having to seek it. I'm aware that it's a hopeless cry for help that would get my no sympathy for such an obviously irrational action. Really, I don't know what to do, and am out of options, and am aware that no one can directly help me, that in the end, I have to do it myself. I'm afraid that I can't, and i'll have to be pushed into doing something I don't want to for my own good. I feel like I have to somehow desperately prove to myself that there is something wrong with me that I haven't chosen to do, because I can't shake the feeling of responsibility for how i've chosen my life to turn out the way it did, and the absence of any internal evidence (because I am avoiding it) gives me the notion that what I have is nothing more fake than what I made up, a convenient storyline of a mental disorder to justify the route of my life.

More likely, though, i'm just going to do the same things i've been doing for the past 8 years of my pitiful school life, and in the future, am going to return to the same notions I have now, when pushed enough to an edge to consider voicing out myself, knowing that i'd let out just enough pressure to keep me going for a few more years of the same.


I apologize for being extremely pessimistic to anyone who may read this and end up believing that anything I say makes rational sense. It doesn't, and no one should ever be like me.",11,2011-11-30 19:50:48 EST-0500
22,"Sunday at 6 pm: anxiety support group conference call, anyone?","So, I should mention that this is a throwaway. I regularly post to r/anxiety under my normal username, and I'm quite active here. :)

Tomorrow, I'm going to be the guest speaker on an anxiety support group conference call. Aaaanyone can join...I'll be talking about my panic disorder, anxiety, agoraphobia, other phobias (probably a bit about emet), and the like. 

Everyone is welcome to introduce themselves on the phone call & chat a little bit about what makes them anxious and what kind of struggles you've been going through recently...but you don't have to talk if you don't want to. You can just sit back and listen. :)

The phone # is 1-559-546-1700. Then, enter 640024#. It's a California area code, but if you have nationwide calling on your cell (which everyone seems to have nowadays), you should be fine. Or, call from your Google Voice account if you think you'll have cell issues.

Hope some of you can make it! I listened in on the call last month and it was really nice to feel connected with strangers across the US who share all of my anxious quirks.

Edit: **6pm EST! Sorry about that!**

Edit #2: The call is finished! Thanks to any of you who joined. :) Next call is on Sunday, December 11th at 6 pm EST.",7,2011-11-13 06:13:33 EST-0500
23,Does anyone else have anxiety about internet social interaction?,"I've always had pretty bad social anxiety in real life, but it's not much better in online forums, etc.

I get motivated enough to post, but then am terrified to look back and see what the reaction is.  Then I feel embarrassed for abandoning my thread and *really* don't want to go back and look.  Then I wonder why I posted at all...

Similar things made me quit WoW after trying unsuccessfully to get into it.  I loved Final Fantasy games, and the idea of my party members being actual people cooperating sounded great.  But I realized it was just never going to be fun for me, since bringing myself to join a PUG and withstand the inevitable criticism (I was a noob and stayed that way due to not PUGging) was a huge effort.  Maybe this speaks to the immaturity of WoW players but it also speaks to my anxiety in online interactions.

Anyway, I get the impression that most people with social anxiety IRL don't have it online.  Is this true?  Does anyone have tips on dealing with what I'm talking about?  (And yes, I realize the irony of making this post.)",8,2011-11-15 10:57:40 EST-0500
24,Anxiety is causing me to fail all my classes,"For the past couple of months I have been having Anxiety and Panic attacks. I will have headaches, dizzyness, numbness in my legs, and difficulty breathing. I have a huge pile of work to do and only a couple of weeks before the end of the semester. Everytime I try to sit and do work or think about the work I have to do I have a panic attack. Sometimes they will be at random. At this point I don't want to try and do my work because It will just cause me more problems. Sometimes I will not be able to sleep or wake up in the morning unable to breathe. Despite this my counselor and Assistant principal want me to go on an attendance contract. If I break this contract there could be potential legal action taken against my mother which stresses me out even more. All in all, I'm having anxiety which is causing to miss school. Missing school has resulted in a pile of work that I have little time to finish which causes me more anxiety. I'm still waiting to see psychiatrist. I am a freshman and this is certainly not the way I want to start my high school career. I am also currently on Zanex which the doctor said to take as needed. I have only taken it twice because I have heard it can be very addictive.  Any advice anyone can give me would be greatly appreciated

I also find that it builds up a momentum; that when I've done it multiple days in a row, it seems to ""set in"" a more relaxed physical feeling in my body. So I guess this is just a reminder. If you're tired of feeling tense all the time, go grab those running shoes!

44,Can anyone identify with me?,"I'm really frustrated and just want to see if anybody else is experiencing the same symptoms as I am.

I used to feel awesome, but after a few traumatic events I've gone completely down hill.

I used to be comfortable with myself, love having a good time, love to party, hang around with friends, joke around, make chit chat with classmates, etc. I liked to be funny, draw, play music, and all the good stuff. I'm an intelligent person and used to do very well in school but no more.

After a few traumatic events (est 3-4 years ago) my personality completely changed. Here's what I feel like every day.

- I feel physically tired all day
- I haven't had a genuine laugh in years
- I can't connect with anybody, I have a few friends on the surface but no friends that I can just relax and enjoy myself with
- Extremely low self esteem
- Tons of anxiety
- Can't concentrate on my studies
- Have no passion for any subject or hobby
- Push people away when they get too close
- Constant knot in my gut
- At any time in the day I would rather be taking a nap
- Talking to anybody about anything is exhausting for me
- Constant verbal thoughts about killing myself. Stuff like ""fucking shoot me in the face"" ""if I could push a button so that I would never exist I would"" ""kill me now"" **note that I'm not suicidal or anything, these are just thoughts that kind of precipitate out of my frustration**
- Drinking does not affect me at all in the way that it used to, so while all of my friends love to party and have a few drinks I can join but I don't enjoy myself.
- When my old friends from high school who knew me as a fun guy come back to town it just stresses me out because now I act awkward and apathetic around them
- Can't even feel comfortable around family anymore.

Things I have tried (believe me I am proactive at trying to conquer this fucking shit)

- Zoloft (Currently taking)
- Celexa
- Effexor
- Therapy
- Putting myself outside of my comfort zone/""out there""
- Never making excuses to not do something social

None of these medications have seemed to do anything and I have a strong suspicion they're probably more or less placebos.

45,New subreddit for people who support people with anxiety,"First off, thanks for all this subreddit has helped me with, as I learn more about my wife's anxiety.

Out of those posts, I've realized that a separate subreddit may help for people who are supporting their loved ones as they deal with anxiety. So, I created [/r/anxietysupporters](http://www.reddit.com/r/anxietysupporters/). 

If you have anxiety, and have a loved one who is a redditor, pass along this new subreddit. 

I welcome any comments, suggestions, or offers to help moderate :-).",3,2011-12-09 22:28:25 EST-0500
46,19y/o college freshman and i have anxiety.,"I was diagnosed last fall. Since then I've taken Effexor and then Venlafaxine (generic Effexor). When i was first diagnosed i was put Lorazapam because the anxiety was that big a deal. With my Anxiety come Social Anxiety, I had and have friends but i don't really talk too much. For me it's hard making friends. Spent the greater part of my senior year switching friend groups. I've never had a girlfriend. Hell i just got my first kiss at a party a couple weeks ago when i was drunk and this chick just started man handling me. When i think about it, it makes me sad that i haven't had a girlfriend. One of my better friends has a girlfriend and they've been dating for 9 months and when i see them i get even sadder that i don't have, or never have had, what they have. I've tried to do stuff like get in shape and workout, but every time i do, i end up working out for 20 minutes then saying to myself that i suck and then i stop and get even more sad that i stopped working out but i have no motivation to go back. I guess I'm saying all this because outside my family only 2 people know i have Anxiety and one of them guessed it from the way I behave and I guess i just want to tell someone. So if you read this, thanks for listening. ",8,2011-12-15 12:33:34 EST-0500

49,Could not get on the train to work this morning.,"I could feel my anxiety growing and growing and by the time I got to the train platform I was having a panic attack. I managed to get on the train eventually but I had to get off at the next stop because I felt trapped. After I calmed myself down a bit I got back on the train again. Same thing happened and I got off again. I kept think ""what if I make a fool of myself and pass out in public?"" Finally I gave in and took a xanax and here I am at work now... With the xanax I can feel the adrenaline still in my body but my brain says ""who cares?"" instead of ""oh my god I'm gonna pass out"". I'm not sure why I'm posting this but it seems to make me feel better...

Edit: Thanks for the kind words and tips everyone. I normally don't have a fear of being on the train but yesterday the panic just hit me. Today I was able to ride all the way with only mild anxiety. I used several tips you guys left for me yesterday such as playing a game on my iPod and breathing through my nose. I have a headache today though which I think is from the xanax I took yesterday morning... 
I'm pretty confident I'm through the worst of it. Now I just need to look into the root cause of my anxiety and address that.

50,Anxiety seems to be controlling my life. I really need advice. ,"I have been diagnosed with an anxiety disorder, and it affects my life a great deal. I've been on five different medications for it, and I'm not sure if any really work. 

I don't get out and socialize a lot, although I work in an area where i deal with customer on a minute to minute basis. I'm very polite and cheerful, but when alone or stressed, worries stack up and emotion tends to scale very high. 

I've tried dating a lot, but most people either stop talking to me, or feel I have too much anxiety. When out on a date, I worry about a lot, especially if I've upset my date. I've been sent to a psych ward for this happening actually. 

Thoughts really get to me a lot. It's hard to break a negative chain, though I know how to put on a mask and help people at work. People usually notice something is up, but not enough to be critical. My friend says I know how to fool doctors, as she thinks their diagnosis of who I am seems very off base.

I'm worried about money problems, my parents' divorce, employment issues, church obligations, social situations, being out of shape and overweight, being depressed, being lonely. And yet there's another side, too. Sometimes I just won't care about any of these things. I just try to slide by everything. Nothing is important, nothing matters because I'm so utterly worthless. Sometimes these feelings happen within hours of each other.

I'm in a new town, don't know even how to go about getting a doctor, scared to death of actually going to see one, have no money to pay for anything, plus I don't know if I actually want to get help. I'm afraid I'll do it wrong somehow. I'm afraid I won't say the right things. I never say the right things. And I've never really thought myself worth helping.

  In the midst of an anxiety attack, things tend to spiral.  I was doing the things I should to calm down when, as I was getting out of my car in the parking garage, I dropped my cell.  It pops into three pieces.

So i find the main cell immediately.  I find the battery by lying facedown on the parking surface and reachig under the car.  But i cannot find the back of the phone.  I give up and go upstairs, feeling like i dont have time, like i cant deal with it, with my hands all full of my coffee and my work stuff and lunch, and possibly being late.

But once i had checked in and dropped my things off, I stood up and walked down to the garage again.  I imagined how much headache i would have with a cell phone with no back how it would cost me money, how I would look like a jerk in front of my new boss using a phone with no back.  And all I needed to do was find it.

I went back downstairs, lay on the ground some more, and found it in the shadows.  But i could not reach it.   So i checked in my car for something I could use to extend my reach, and Found my son's toy Darth Vader lightsaber.  

i could not see the back of my phone anymore from where I could reach it, so I lit it up, glowing red and dropped to the ground with the sound of the ightsaber's effects as it moved.  I ran it over the ground like a CSI tech searching for bloodspatter with a UV light.  and i found it.  LIKE A BOSS it felt.

I've been having attacks for the past couple of evenings when I try to go to sleep - heart palpitations, pains consistent with earlier attacks, all the good stuff - and it makes falling asleep extremely hard. My doc said it's more common for people to have attacks in the middle of the night, but I find myself having the worst of it just as I'm about to fall asleep, sometimes I'll be just about to go out for the night when I jump back awake and everything starts again.

I've noticed that I am more likely to fall asleep despite of the anxiety when I have a light on in the room, it makes me feel like a little kid sometimes, but it's somehow comforting. Another thing I do is just getting up for a while, letting my symptoms go away as much as they will and trying again.

69,Don't know how I'm going to make it through the year (xpost from r/depression),"I guess I'll just type out what I'm feeling right now, not sure if anyone wants to read it but whatever. My problems probably sound pretty lame compared to what many others are going through so I'll just feel stupid posting this...

I have struggled with depression on and off all my life since early childhood, and social anxiety too for about 3 or 4 years. I'm 19 now and in college. Everyone says that college is the best time of your life, you'll make lots of friends that you'll know forever and have such a great time. So far it has been miserable for me.
I hate many things about this town and about my college. I can't put my finger on it, but for some reason the environment just seems to make my depression and social anxiety so much worse. I can't transfer to another school because it's kind of a non-traditional school and the credits usually don't transfer well at all. I have friends but I'm not close to them, I often feel like I am being left out of the group. Last year we were planning on getting a house together and basically they went ahead and got a house without me because the circumstances made it so I couldn't commit to it just yet (they did it earlier than we had planned because they found ""the perfect house""). So now I live on campus away from everyone, they say I'm welcome to come over any time but to me it just feels weird. Maybe I'm just over analyzing. I do that a lot. Either way, they're not good friends and I know that I should just make new ones but it's so hard for me. I don't know how and social interaction scares the shit out of me. I was hoping that my roommates this year would be potential friends but so far they just sit in their rooms all the time and it makes me feel like I'm the only one living here.

I have a boyfriend who lives about an hour away and he is very supportive. He's the only one I can really be open with about this stuff. My parents divorced last year and my mom got a new boyfriend, he's really cool but ever since she's been with him, things between us haven't been the same. She just has her own life now and that's understandable but it has been a little hard to get used to. So I feel uncomfortable talking with her about this but I could if I had to. My dad is a good person but we aren't very close, he is difficult to communicate with.

Ok, I know this has been really unorganized and all over the place...

Basically, I feel like shit and I don't want to be here. I want to be back with my boyfriend but the circumstances just don't allow it, and that wouldn't solve the problem anyway because the real problem to a certain extent is that I am uncomfortable in my own skin. I am just coming to terms with this. For a long time I felt like a confident person but I guess I was just lying to myself. I have tried talking to counselors at school but they were unhelpful and just gave me the numbers of some other counselors that I would have to pay for. To be fair I wasn't comfortable enough to really talk about what was bothering me so maybe it was partially my fault.

Anyway, I don't know what I'm getting at. I just feel so desperate sometimes. Everyone else around me talks about what a great time they're having at college and I just die inside a little bit every time I hear it.

This might sound kind of pathetic but I was wondering if anyone would be interested in being ""pen pals"" of sorts over email and having an ongoing discussion about our anxiety/depression problems, not necessarily always asking for advice but just venting about it. Preferably someone who can relate to the specific things I'm talking about.",8,2011-09-24 03:30:00 EDT-0400
70,"Agoraphobic shut-in former-genius needs to **earn** a sum of money, however small, with less than 20 mins work. Does such work exist? ","A few months ago I inquired about beginning overcoming ten years of agoraphobia.  [olderpost](http://www.reddit.com/r/Assistance/comments/i3e3u/ive_been_a_housebound_agoraphobic_for_10_years/).  The answers were very helpful and encouraging. 

Let's me ask a related question that appears to be about employment but is actually about social phobia.  [x-post r/Assistance](http://redd.it/k7pfp)

Here's the situation:

* A housebound agoraphobic, 10+yrs plus in the room.  
* Used to be a genius, fancy pants mathematician type
* Looking to **earn** (not be given, earn) a very small sum of money. 
* The work interaction should be done online, over text communication. 
* Total work period should be under 20 mins.
* Low stress work.   Won't make it as a day trader or a fighter pilot. 
* If I have a panic attack and can't complete the work,  nothing should blow up.  

These are very crazy preconditions, until you realize I'm not looking for employment, I'm looking for therapy.   Specifically:  

* I don't care how must they pay me!    I don't want charity and I don't want to feel exploited, and beyond that,  I'm ultra-flexible.     
* I really did used to be a genius type,  even still I can still pretty quickly learn almost any ""knowledge worker skill"" or software-related skill.   

The point, you see, is not so much to earn money, but to re-engage in society by taking a tiny tiny babystep to employment.  

Keeping in mind I don't want gifts-- there are more worthy recipients than me for that.   I just want Information--   ideas to help me take a babystep towards greater independence. 

Advice and brainstorms greatly welcomed :)

71,"Years in denial: 16. Cost to fix: $7500. Don't put off the dentist like I did, please... (x-post from r/reddit)","Don't worry, there's a tl;dr waaaaaay down there!

It all started in 3rd grade. It was free time in the classroom. Four of us were standing in a group when something funny 
happened, whatever it was. I smiled and laughed. The group dissipated shortly. One of them stayed back with me and said 
""Why are your teeth yellow?"" It hit me kind of hard, made me recede into my brain. ""Is this true? Maybe. Either way, I have 
to respond..."" I said that I just had yellow candy. I was eyed very suspiciously and was called a liar. I told her I didn't 
know, and hung my head in embarrassment. That's when I stopped smiling. Third grade.

I'm now 27 years old and embarking on a journey, away from the life I've let myself live.

I want to start off by saying my dad is the best dad I could ever wish or hope for. I would literally die for him, no 
questions asked. He has never been the type of man to say ""I love you,"" and when he does, his pitch goes up a little bit 
and he says it almost in the form of a question. I heard it a few times as a child, but it didn't need to be said. I mean, 
I totally wouldn't have minded hearing it a little bit more, but that's not the issue. That being said, he is also a man. 
And men tend to do things the ""man"" way, which is not the way a female would do it, especially when it comes to being a 
single father of two children. 

My mom left us when I was 5. I didn't see her for a few years, maybe a couple times a year. Around the age of 9 or 10 I 
started seeing her every other weekend... most of the time. She had a lot going for her and I didn't really mind. I always 
looked forward to going to stay with her because it was a whole different world than the way it was at home with dad. My 
sister is a sister from another mister. She is 8 years older than me and I always make fun of her age, because no matter 
what, I'll never be as old as her. My dad had adopted her when she was very young, 4 or 5 I think, but don't quote me. Her 
biological father lived on the other side of the country and gave up his rights. I think that my mom made a very good 
decision when she married my dad. He is a great man and would help anyone who was trying to help themselves. He is a very 
charitable man, to say the least. My mom couldn't have picked a better person to leave her kids with. He has always been a 
great role model to my sister and me.

Back to him being just a man. While growing up, I kind of just did what he did. He would put me in the tub and say ""Keep 
your head above the water, I'll be back in 15 minutes."" I really didn't know what to do. I would shampoo my hair and kind 
of play with the wash cloth. I didn't know how to clean my body properly. I didn't really learn that until I was 9. I had 
gone out and played in the rain with a friend, and I ended up covered head to toe in mud. To the tub I went. I took a bath, 
the water was brown and what I could see was clean. Exit shower, dry off. Look in the mirror, everything was muddy except 
my arms and legs. It was a good lesson. My grandma T was a good teacher when it came to personal hygiene. She would tell me 
to wash my face (don't forget to clean behind your ears), armpits, and feet. I never understood why, but I did it anyways. 
Heaven forbid I get into bed with dirty feet, she would have raged at me so bad.

And now that the relationship is over and i'm readjusting my focus onto myself and exploring certain things in therapy I realize just how much I overthink EVERYTHING and how much it absolutely kills the joy in doing said things. 

Some of thing things that are regular stressors:

* Constantly worrying / thinking about every goddamn possibility of any situation in a flurry of thoughts, this is horribly magnified whenever a relationship is involved, it starts manifesting it physically, unable to sleep, eat, just a constant whirring of blinding thought. 

* Not being able to actually get things done because I spend so much time fretting over the time to do it, the motivation to do it, the effort etc. 

* constantly feeling some sort of pressure when in social situations to be liked, I feel i've assumed a persona around other people that I know will be well received because I have anxiety over showing my true self. 

* Never being able to plan dates because I fret over how horribly wrong it will go and how contrived it is

* Always feeling a slight tightness in my chest when confronted with tasks. 

* Constantly envisioning ""skyscrapers"" with certain projects when all that is necessary is a simple shed

These are some of the things I feel day to day that are really starting to get me into a low-level depression and hurt my mental energy levels. 

Does this qualify as anxiety? Sorry if that sounds stupid but the notion that this constant nagging that has been lowering my quality of life all these years can actually be labeled surprises me

82,Anyone else get incredibly intense nostalgia on occasion? ,"I am a very anxious person, to the point where it has and probably should still be medicated. In addition to all of my regular anxieties, sometimes I just look back and think how great things were just a few years ago, and I don't think they will ever be that good again, I just don't see it in the world. 

I think this is tied to my anxiety because it is kind of an anxious feeling, but anxiety is a lot about not being present in the current moment, which nostalgia is clearly not. 

I guess I am just curious if it happens to anyone else. ",16,2011-10-06 05:58:27 EDT-0400

My anxiety finally culminated with a girl I had been seeing. I finally found someone I could trust with my true feelings and I let it all out, all of the fear and over-analyzing, all of the things I kept from my other friends and family to keep up appearances. She looked at me wide-eyed and told me that I have an anxiety disorder and should seek therapy. I had avoided thinking about it for years, but it finally got through. Calling the therapist was one of the hardest things I've ever done. One meeting down and I feel a little better. Medication was suggested, but I am reluctant.

Even if no one reads this, it still feels good to let it out. Thanks reddit, you get me through the day.",15,2011-10-04 03:58:12 EDT-0400

It's the worst fucking thing in the world to me. I think it might be the fact that if I am out and about and I need to throw up I won't have a place to do so in private. For the record, I only throw up about once a year if that and it's usually due to having the flu or a cold. I know it's irrational and I am an extremely rational person usually. 

I try to say ""fuck it"" lets do it and when I do that after the fact I usually really enjoyed what I did but the dread going into new experiences with unknowns is a trigger I think.

The school only had 3900 students (about 1500 more than my high school), but it felt huge. I don't know if I could handle being around so many people.

90,The first call.,"Even with a throwaway I'm hesitant to go into too much detail. I'm making an appointment with a psychiatrist soon. Granted soon for me has always meant hitting the proverbial snooze button for a month or so, repeatedly. It's so damn hard to just pick up the phone, speak with someone I don't know/am not familiar with, and make an appointment. The anxiety is getting worse thinking about it, writing about it, posting an anonymous thread under a nondescript account on a section of a website that (I hope) can likely sympathize.. I can't wait for it to be lessened. Through drug treatment and continual therapy I know it will, but over a decade of feeling anxious about most things, panic attacks, and deepening depression will not be fixed quickly. All the more reason to start now. It's still so hard.

I mean, I haven't left my house is 5 years but a few times. Before that I only went out for schooling that I frequently skipped or called in sick for because of the anxiety. If I get through this phone call, will I even make the first appointment? Staying inside is so much more comfortable compared to how I felt over half a decade ago, when I had some semblance of a normal life, but I also became miserable and suicidal because of the incredible stress of constant anxiety. I'm miserable now, also, which is what's scaring me as I've minimized anything that can put me into those horrible feelings of anxiety. Depression, anxiety, panic attacks, and in some instances either anger, or when I deny myself that self-hating rage - incredible sadness coupled with self-hatred. I'm at the same time looking forward to, and not looking forward to the appointments - I hope all this effort will be worth it.



I'm not sure what the point of this thread was other than to quasi-rant and maybe get some perspective on others' experiences. To give this post more of a point I'll ask a question: Has anyone been as far gone as me in regards to ~~letting~~ having anxiety completely destroy their life and how was your journey back?

Thank you for reading.

Edit: I forgot to mention in the post, that while this is probably discouraged behavior as it's me continuing to avoid situations that cause me anxiety which is the exact opposite of what CBT would have me do, I had originally had a family member call them to set up an appointment for me but they require anyone over the age of 18 make an appointment themselves - for privacy reasons. I'm not quite sure how I feel about that, and I have no idea if that's common practice.

Edit 2/Update: Well I actually made the call. I'm looking at the appointment date and time that I wrote down, as well as the email the receptionist sent me and still a bit in disbelief that this is finally happening. I nearly had a panic attack trying to call, and then when eventually getting through I felt like throwing up - so I'm a bit 'winded' from the whole experience. But there's also a slight feeling of relief. I'm finally getting help. I'm optimistic but still a bit 'shaken'. I hope the treatment works out.",8,2011-10-13 14:19:25 EDT-0400

109,Hello! I'm new to this sub; please read my story! Looking for advice about my anxiety problem.,"I'm a 23 year-old male, currently at university. In my life, I have experienced normal amounts of anxiety--that is, when I was supposed to. However, this has recently changed, and I am scared and confused at how to handle this new change in my mentality.

I'm not sure when the ""change"" started to occur, it was probably a gradual developmental thing that has progressed over the past few months. Looking back to last November, I was completely anxiety-free (with the exception of the ""normal"" anxiousness anyone would get from anxiety-inducing situations). Last march, during spring break, I got sleep deprived and had been getting about three or maybe less hours of sleep per night. By the end of the week, I was an anxious mess--I felt all the typical symptoms: hopelessness, dread, urge to have a bowel movement, and sometimes a tightness in the chest. When I returned home from said vacation, I basically spent a few weeks recuperating and getting my sleep schedule back on track. I am now seeing a psychiatrist who has prescribed Clonazepam, 0.5mg three times a day (once every six hours). I've been on the medication now for about a month and I love it, it effectively eliminates this new ""ambient"" anxiety that I recently started feeling.

However, I am new to medications in general and am now aware that my body has probably become physiologically addicted to the drug, and I've heard that the withdrawals are going to be intense. I do plan on eventually tapering off, and hopefully soon. Does anyone have any insight on the taper off? I've also heard mixed opinions about benzodiazepines--some say they're horrible, some say they're great, and my psychiatrist tells me there's nothing to worry about. Still, I am inquisitive about the nature of the drug.

My psychiatrist diagnosed me with ""episodic mood disorder,"" and had me get a blood test to check my thyroid for any hormonal imbalances. When the test came back, I was told that my TSH levels are high (3.9 on some unit scale that I'm not familiar with), which would imply hypothyroidism, which is the opposite of what would be expected since anxiety is usually linked to hyperthyroidism! He scheduled me to see an endocrinologist. The endocrinologist essentially told me that it's a guess-and-check with thyroid patients and he wants another blood test, which I'm going to get to him as soon as possible (been very busy this week). Does anyone else have any insight about the endocrine system and how it could affect the sympathetic nervous system? I've read a lot about what anxiety actually is, the ""fight-or-flight"" response, and it's supposed to be mitigated by the parasympathetic nervous system. I'm no brain scientist, so that's the extent of my knowledge about it. I've started practicing breathing exercises, which helps, but it's not that useful for me because my anxiety is almost perpetually there, in the background (when it's there).

Some things I would like to add about my condition that I think are relevant and might help someone here diagnose my problem or perhaps give me some insight:

I sleep at the same time every night for 8-9 hours and have little trouble getting to sleep thanks to Clonazepam (I'm pretty sure). I don't have anxiety for most of the day, it comes primarily at night, like around 6-7pm. I started lifting weights again a few days ago and I've been weak and having the typical muscle pains associated with working out for the first time in a while. I've noticed that in my weakened state, the anxiety is substantially worse, it even comes through the Clonazepam dose.

I'm also scared about the current and eventual side-effects of Clonazepam. I've almost completely lost my libido and I feel weakened. Apparently Clonazepam is metabolized in the liver and has similar effects as alcohol, which would explain both side-effects. I'm really scared about the memory-loss that supposed to occur, but that doesn't happen for a while.

Also it should be noted that I've only had one panic attack; it came from smoking a joint (first time in my life) last December. Worst feeling ever, felt like I was going to die. I haven't had an attack since, but the anxiety is still a lingering thing. It comes out of the blue, seemingly completely unrelated to my thoughts at the time. Like tonight for instance, I was playing Minecraft and suddenly the anxiety just onset and I lost all interest in what I was doing, started getting that bowel-movement feeling, and am feeling just generally shitty.

For anyone who read this, I appreciate your time and am thankful for any replies or insight about the matter.

117,Having a tough time...not as bad as others but I am growing concerned.,"Hello, I am a 36 year old college student and I work a full time job. I am married but we do not have children. I am taking two classes right now, one of which is Trig which I am having an awful time with since math has never been my strong subject. I am already enrolled three classes for Fall, classes which seem 'heavy' to me. The problem is that in the last week and a half (basically since school started) I am having episodes of feeling very anxious, only three occurrences but up until now I have only experienced these feelings a couple times a year. The first two episodes were last week and the other was this morning.  I can't even describe with words how I feel. Physically there seems to be no symptoms like shortness of breath or anything, just a feeling of anxiety. The feelings last between 10 minutes to a couple hours. Since it happened I am concerned that I am taking on too many classes in Fall if this is how I am reacting to two classes. I have actually been in school for almost three years now but usually only with 2 classes.  Anxiety, depression, agoraphobia, and epilepsy run in my family. Personally I have only battled with depression, which I don't have any problems with anymore, and anxiety.  I am wondering if I should look in to medication for this. If I take less classes I feel like I am being a slacker but I am just not sure how I can handle the stress of it all emotionally. I don't even know what I am asking here. I don't know if my increased frequency is enough to be worried about. Meds or no meds? Not try three classes next semester? Advice on how to handle these anxious feelings? Any feedback is welcome. Thanks for reading. I am sure I babbled but my head is not in the right place right now. Also related, I was working on my Trig homework last night from 5pm to 12:30am so I am definitely low on sleep but the other times I have felt anxious I was well rested.

120,Best practices for asking your Primary Care Physician for anxiety medication?,"I'm 26, and have anxiety my whole life.

During rough life situations, it becomes unbearable.  Right now, I am currently suffering from some of the worst anxiety I've ever experienced.

I've been on depression/anxiety medication before for several years, but the side effects became too much to bear (I was tired ALL the time).  I stopped taking that medication, and switched to another that also did not work (I got suicidal, which I had never been before), and stopped taking that medication.

It has been approximately a year since I stopped taking any medication whatsoever.  I do feel that without medication included in my treatment, I am slowly retreating back into my anxious brain.  It is starting to affect my relationships and my work/home balance.

I need help on asking for medication.  My doctor absolutely refuses to give me any medication that she deems ""addicting,"" saying that they do not give those out unless it is a ""special"" case (example: Xanax).  Many of my friends are offering to refer me to their doctors, but I'm nervous that I'll be seem as ""shopping"" for doctors in order to get medication, and that makes me terrified.

Any help would be greatly appreciated.  I need to make this appointment as soon as I can.

First of all, here's how my attacks feel like at present time. Whenever I am in a situation where an attack may occur I usually have an overall queasiness, like you are about to take an exam. If an attack hits me, then it begins by rippling through my body with sort of sickly tingling sensation. The worst physical effect I get is by far the nausea. It is horrible. I have thrown up a couple of times. There is an overwhelming desire to flee, and my mind begins to race as it tries to figure out ways to get out of whatever situation I am in. As for medication I have been taking 20mg of Cipralex for the past 4 years, both to combat the anxiety, but also because of bouts of depression that I have been experiencing. I also have some Oxabenz that I take prior to stressful situations.    

I actually first experienced anxiety attacks when I was about 12. I was taking the train home from school when a guy sitting in the back moves forward and sits a couple of seats away from me. While making eye-contact with me, and looking like a freaking psycho, he draws out a gun and starts fidgeting around with it. I freaked out and ran off at the next station, telling the train operator about the guy (later my Mom read in the local paper that the cops had checked him out and that it had been a fake, prop gun). Anyway, for weeks after that I began suffering mild anxiety attacks whenever I had to ride the train. I don't remember how long it took, maybe a year, but eventually the attacks subsided and went away.

Fast forward until I'm 19. My Dad passes away after a 3 year battle with cancer. The last 6 months he had mostly lived at home, being immobilized due to the cancer spreading to his bones. For the majority of that time I had sort of isolated myself, living in my own little world where I would sleep most of the day and play games at night, having little responsibilities because I had finished school. I was having difficulties dealing with my Dad's illness, and basically refused to talk to anyone about it. I pretended everything was OK and numbed myself out. About 2 months after my Dad passed away everything suddenly caved in. I first began having trouble swallowing and my stomach was upset. Then one night I suddenly had a massive anxiety attack, and began vomiting. Next day I went to the Doctor who prescribed me Truxal. I also entered a weekly grief group with other young people that had lost parents (headed by psychologists). For about 6 months I steadily processed my Dad's illness and death in the group, and it helped a lot. In this period I suffered from generalized anxiety, where I was basically on edge most of the time, felt sick and sometimes experienced anxiety attacks because I was convinced I had cancer. This eventually subsided too, and despite occasional bouts with hypochondria I was becoming myself again.

However, towards the end of the grieving sessions I suddenly began experiencing anxiety attacks when riding in trains again. I talked to a psychiatrist attached to the grief group, but she said it wasn't anxiety attacks I was feeling, rather just an overall sense of uneasiness. Gradually the train related anxiety went away, but instead I now began experiencing anxiety in social situations, which plagues me to this day. Although I'm naturally introverted, I have no problem holding conversations and I used to have absolutely no issues whatsoever. I get along okay with people at my University when I'm at classes and what not. My anxiety mostly manifests itself in situations where I have to go somewhere to meet someone. As in, I make an arrangement and am therefore obliged to stay somewhere for a while. I don't go to parties or make new friends, because my anxiety is way worse if it's with people I don't know well. For the same reason I don't see girls. I feel like I can't go somewhere and just ""go with the flow,"" I feel like I can't travel anywhere either. I can go out to concerts or to a cafe by myself and although I will be on edge, I won't have any straight out panic attacks, but I am usually mentally exhausted afterwards and need to decompress at home. When I'm with other people I do way better in situations where I don't feel ""trapped,"" e.g. walking around outside. If I sit still in a room with someone I don't know well, my anxiety begins to build quickly. Same goes with eating for some reason. Sitting still and eating in a potential stressful situation (besides with my family) is difficult for me. 

It's basically crippling my life and I want to be back in control and be able to do whatever I want without constantly having to fear anxiety.   ",5,2011-07-14 01:41:38 EDT-0400

143,Desperately need help. Not sure where to turn.,"Hi all,

I am posting here for advice on where to go, what to do, and perhaps gain hope. Sit tight, it's a bit of a story.

I first encountered problems with Anxiety after a bad mushroom trip almost three years ago. For three months I felt pretty screwed in the head, with symptoms of anxiety and dp/dr. During this time I avoided all substances (alcohol, weed) and remained sober. 3-4 months later I decided to try weed again while drunk, and it didn't have a negative effect for the most part -- and I began using it again frequently.

Over a year ago I got a brilliant developer job working in the city -- the type of job which is very rare -- good money for my age, friendly directors/bosses (more friends!), etc.. I became very happy. I felt like the happiest person in the world, although perhaps a few things were missing. 

I commuted everyday for an hour and a half on the train (three hours a day), which meant that I was leaving at 7AM and not getting back until 8PM - 11PM every single working day. I was still smoking marijuana at this time.

About 6 months ago I decided to give it up, and have tried it on and off (maybe 8 times in total) since then. Ever since I gave up I began to slip into depression and anxiety. I feel like I am loosing control of my mind. For the past three months, I have begun having panic attacks (severe) on the train, and I feel like I just don't have enough energy to cope anymore. I gave up on the train and stay in London, but I feel trapped in a city -- a city which is crowded with no countryside.

I feel like I can't take it anymore. That, and I wonder if I should be going to university to get a degree and spending more of my life living and experiencing things before I give so much of my time away for money.

I just don't know what to do anymore. Recently I feel like Iv'e been getting worse. Paranoid about things around me -- waiting for a 'glitch' in reality to confirm that I'm going psychotic or schizophrenic. At one point I even felt like I was surrounded by evil. I feel like I could get on a train and just completely lose it, smash the windows and jump out, jump off a bridge, whatever. Like I would completely lose it and kill myself almost as if it was an instant reflex. I have woken up screaming in the night because I thought I was either dying or my legs stopped working (rare).

I get incredibly dizzy sometimes, everything seems to fly past, sometimes I litterally feel like I can't walk (perhaps described as legs turning to jelly.. but I feel more like I just cant move). Other times I just feel like I need to escape. More often that not I feel like I can never relax. Like what is happening to me is constant.

I try to read things to find help, but people seem to give advice that doesn't seem to help. People that seem to think it's something that happens once and a while and then you're fine. Not something constant.

A few weeks ago I ended up in hospital because I demanded that I needed tests done -- they seemed to think it was anxiety. I visited a pschologist twice but they just gave me some bullshit questionaires to fill in each week, so I demanded more help. I was transferred to another more senior psychologist but they dropped me because I didn't attend -- because they sent the letter to my home address and I was not home as I am staying in the city.

What really annoys me is that I feel like I could have a perfect life, if it were not for the anxiety/depression and feeling so trapped.. and feeling like I'm never going to have any time again. Like I am a slave.

I was prescribed medications, but have not taken them because of fear of worsening. Even if it makes me worse initially -- how am I supposed to commute to work? I wouldn't want to take them while staying elsewhere.

I have tried excersizing -- that does not seem to help a whole lot. Maybe I am doing something wrong there. I just don't know what to do anymore.

I want to live. I am only 21 years old. Although sometimes I feel like it's just going to end soon. That I can't possibly continue. That eventually I will cave. I think it's a miracle I havn't already. I think it'd take a miracle to save me now too. Like my mind is fucked beyond repair. Not that I did a whole lot of drugs.. mainly just alcohol and weed. 

So if theres anybody out there. Anybody at all that can say something meaningful. Please come to my aid.",5,2011-07-10 22:02:52 EDT-0400

145,"New to the ""panic"" world","I have had issues dealing with people from a ""social anxiety"" perspective most of my life, but never debilitating to the point were i felt unable to function.

At an early age I got involved in drugs, mostly of a psychotropic nature (IE Marijuana, LSD, mushrooms that sort of thing) but have avoided them for the last 10 years or so.

Oddly enough even with my aversion to people the only serious jobs I've ever held have been sales jobs. During the beginnings of my career this wasn't as big an issue working in a call center and being able to ""hide"" behind the phone really gave me the confidence to excel and I received lots of recognition, etc. Subsequent to this however i was promoted into management and forced again to deal with folks face-to-face.

I haven't minded it and been successful doing so for the last 5 years. My anxiety of people easy enough to ""work around"" by keeping people at a safe distance and create comfort zones that still allowed me to build (mostly) healthy relationships with my peers.

The ""problems"" I usually face are severe lack of self confidence and self worth. Even stranger an odd fixation with my nose and eyes. My nose always ""itchs"" or I feel overly aware of it on my face. Additionally certain angles, corners, etc cause me discomfort in feeling threatened they could potentially jab my eyes. (completely unfounded) These problems seem to escalate when forces into social situations. 

The fast paced corporate world and stress inducing expectations coupled with a boss that is a notorious ""mental bully"", seems to have come to a head here recently. I've experienced what I've considered ""social anxiety"" and discomfort most all my life but here recently it seems to have been kicked up a notch. The last week or two have been exhausting, placing me on edge almost 24/7. 

While on the job, I'm barley able to interact without what I feel is a complete meltdown. It is so hard for me to stare at another person in the face without sensory overload or ""eye"" paranoia. Strange is it can be were the person is standing in relation to what is behind them that emphasizes the issue, and who the person is. 

Normally the issues are compounded with physical fatigue. The ""constant vigilance"" of trying to keep it all together is exhausting so I've felt its a downward spiral. Even now my heart races thinking about the next ""panic"" wave.

Am I going crazy? Are these types of ""social issue"" suppose to just surface this late in life (29 y/o) Are any of these symptoms of a specific disorder? I have an appointment with a Dr. tomorrow, but not even sure if thats the right approach.

Thanks for reading/advice",15,2011-07-13 12:52:38 EDT-0400
146,Anxiety has its perks.,,5,2011-07-21 20:08:28 EDT-0400
147,Freedom in fits and starts.,"Reddit has a place for everything doesn't it, so glad I have a place to vent.

Do any of you out there find that they gain freedom from their disorder for periods of time, a week or so, maybe a month if your lucky but then something throws you straight back in?

I have had a major anxiety disorder for most of my life I expect, but Identifiable over the last 4 years when it started manifesting as anxiety around my health. (thats also when it became an actual problem)

The therapist identifies it with me as ""Hyper vigilance"" you see, prior to the time I started 'worrying' about my health I had issues with my father, and would constantly be treading glass around him, this is where it started, constantly having one ear out listening for his diesel truck pulling into the drive, so I could quickly bury myself in some school work or something to appease him.

When my father got help for himself and life evened out for me around the home, it seems my ""mental defense"" turned inward rather than being thrown out now that it wasn't needed. and now I will notice the slightest thing you could call odd about my health. a headache. a pressure in my chest. an ache in my neck. anything like that and instead of treating it as 1. headache 2.heart burn 3. tweaked muscles, it's 1. tumor, 2. heart attack, 3. shifted vertibrae

Why am I giving you my life story? well for context I guess :P maybe to vent a little too. So this freedom I'm talking about in the post title, sometimes I'll have a week, maybe even an entire month where I don't have an anxiety attack, I can get on with my life, I can make movements to improve, I can really knuckle down and /live/.

But always always always, the first anxiety attack after one of these 'holidays' will be a full. on. Panic attack, crippling, no sense of time, gibbering, hiding in my room, mess. And then for the next few days after I will have pretty nasty anxiety attacks.

This is day three after the return of the attacks, I'm sitting here writing this mostly because I want to talk about it with my fellow anxiety sufferers and partly because I'm trying distract my self from the anxiety attack I have been having all day. because of a mild headache no less. I do my tummy breathing, I do my relaxation therapy. I do all the things I learnt in the small amount of CBT I have done, it works when the attacks are weak. But not so much when they are strong like now.

Speaking of CBT it's hard to pay for, I had to stop only part way into it because I simply didn't have the funds to keep going. (it's hard to make money when you have to take every 3rd day off work on average because you have a panic attack that leaves you brainless the rest of the day)

I just want my attacks to level out again, so that I can function day to day at a semi-reasonable level. Rather than this daily barrage.

SO! do any of you experience these 'holidays' from anxiety? and do you always get slammed at the end of them?",7,2011-07-12 06:52:03 EDT-0400

149,"My SO has severe anxiety, and I'm looking for support.","Hey all, 
If there is already a community set up for significant others of anxiety then please point me in that direction.  If there are others in my position who would like to share stories or seek advice, it would be nice to not feel so alone.  If those of you who suffer anxiety have advice, input, or stories of your own that you think could encourage significant others, I'd love to hear it.

I'll start with my story.  Tonight, I'm feeling very discouraged, and admittedly, quite self-pitying.  I've been with my boyfriend for a year and a half.  He has been suffering from a severe anxiety disorder for probably 4 or more years.  This is my first serious relationship and the largest endeavor in humility I have ever undertaken.  I'm sure every healthy relationship requires a lot of sacrifice, but the difference is that if I choose not to sacrifice the eventual end is my boyfriend hiding in a safe place, hyperventilating and totally convinced he is going to die.  I don’t want to do that, intentionally or accidentally, and rarely are the choices even important enough to mind.  He would bend to me if I pushed it, but considering the consequences he must suffer, I can’t wittingly allow it.

But I feel it beginning to get to me.  We can’t often eat together and if we do it’s usually not my kind of food, we can’t often leave the house and if we do it is to one of the two places that he goes to, he can’t spend time with my parents who disapprove of him because they haven’t gotten to know him.  It’s the fear of the future that is really scaring me.  I don’t think that this will ever go away.  What if he never comes to my family get-togethers?  What if he can never travel and I don’t get my one dream of seeing the world?  Do I have to live my whole life with no definite plans because he probably won’t have the mental capacity to do so-and-so?

At this point in my line of worry, I truly begin to hate myself.  I volunteer to be in this with him, because he is worth it.  He is so loving and patient, he is the first man to treat me as an equal with valuable thoughts, and he tries to dang hard to be stronger than his anxiety.  He did not ask for this.  He’s the one that actually has to live with it, and he constantly astounds me with his consideration even in the midst of anxiety.  I know that he feels trapped in the few lifestyle choices he considers “safe”, but more and more I feel like I am completely incapable of doing or saying anything.  I am convinced that somehow I always make things harder for him.  He tried to re-assure me tonight that he doesn’t ever blame me, that he knows his anxiety is based off of completely illogical ideas, that I am good for him.

 I can’t help but feel like a failure.  It so difficult to accept that this is beyond my control and that when he’s losing his mind, I can’t pay him back for all the sunshine he brings into my life.

154,"need help please!! self esteem and self centered issues, which is making me extremely anxious and depressed. "," I am a 27 yr old female who has dealt with major self esteem and selfishness issues and depression since I was little. This is a long post, sorry! So, I am pretty sure I have a good amount of self awareness. Ever since I was young, any friend I had abandoned me or dropped me. Talked bad about me behind my back. Growing up, my family placed a high importance in me making friends. I just never had a social group where I was accepted. My brother played every sport and had a ton of friends (actually he is still just as close with them). Because I was lonely, and never had self worth, I chose friends who weren't good for me. I am not lacking self esteem in appearance, more personality and my decisions. My mother made every decision for me and never encouraged me to make decisions on my own. I was very sheltered. A little backround on my family, very controlling mother with anger issues and very negative, father was passive and a push over. My mom would boss him around a lot. I will also add, that I was raised EXTREMELY SELFISH. I never had chores or responsibility. I always got what I wanted, never had patience or even cared about anything but what I wanted. once I started dating, I always chose guys who werent good enough for me. treated me like I was unimportant. My mother was pushing me to have a bf even in highschool and college, therefor I felt that if I was alone there was something wrong with me. on top of also having brain dead moron girlfriends as friends, I always felt unimportant. 3 years ago, When I was 23, my father passed of lung cancer at 50 yr old. 6 weeks later, I met a con artist on myspace. He pretended his dad was dead also to get in my pants, and stole over grand in cash from me and any sentimental jewelery I owned. After my father passing, the anxiety and depression went into full force. I dont believe I am capable of happiness, and I am constantly worried of terrible things happening now. Luckily 1 yr ago, I met an amazing man who I can say is the first person I have ever loved. He does nice things for me and treats me amazing. I am terrified every day of losing him, like us breaking up. I feel I will fall apart again if I lose him. Problem is also, I am self centered even though my self worth is non existent. I almost purposely sabotage our relationship, because I cant figure out why someone so amazing is in love with me! I only care for my interests, so If we go somewhere like a concert or a movie that HE likes, im completely uninterested and it shows. If we are getting ready to go out somewhere either the beach or dinner, He gets ready for the date a lot slower than me. When I have to sit and wait for him because he is taking longer than me, I feel extreme anger. I feel like hes taking his sweet time because he doesn't care or want to even go as bad as me. I have always been with men who let me control them, and allow me to speak to them any which way and boss them around. He is very strong minded and total opposite of this. I feel helpless because I dont want to be anxious around him like I could lose him any day now, almost expecting it. And I just want to be more selfless and less self centered. Any tips? Books?

I posted a week or so ago about being forced (due to financial hardship) to discontinue my Lexapro treatment.  I've been without for about 5 days now, having only taken a pill on Monday and experiencing a rollercoaster ride of anxiety and depression for most of the day.  The past few have been up and down as well.

One symptom that I've noticed coming back - and by far the most troubling for me - is a dissociation that I experience.  I haven't dealt with it in a long time, as meds have definitely gotten rid of it, but here it is creeping back again - quite badly today.  

It isn't that I can't function - I can work quite fine.  However I have a hard time bringing thoughts to the surface, and the entire world feels like it's a little less real than it used to be.  I'm not quite ""with it,"" and attempts to engage people or activities feel miles away.  Couple that with a healthy dose of dizziness and a wee bit of nausea and everything kinda sucks.

Third, sometimes I feel ""disconnected"" with my body, like my mind and body are two separate things and I am more ""inside"" of my body than a part of it. Things feel very...dreamlike, I guess you could call it, when I get this way. Fourth, I find myself worrying about death a lot. I am only 20, but I constantly imagine myself as very old and near the end of my life and having my loved ones pass away and then eventually I go too. I feel like it will come far too soon and before I'm ready and I think it's the fact that I know its inevitable that is so terrifying but I can't help but think about it and I will start to just completely freak out as if it is happening now.

169,"Do any of you use breathing techniques to reign in your attacks?  If so, what techniques have you used?

","I am constantly worried about something, it could be anything.  Its usually some small detail or some minor matter, but nevertheless I stress my self out over it without fail.

I got so bad that i was noticing every small pain, cramp, twitch and heartbeat.

I went to a massage therapist that claims to be Shaolin Temple trained.  I kind of believe her as I have never seen a women +60 that a) has that kind of strength and energy and b)can inflict that kind of pain on muscles, etc :).

Anyways, she told me one day that she could tell that I was tense, that I probably worried about things too much.  I have no idea, maybe the state of some of my muscles led her to that.

She told me to try this breathing method that she learned at the temple.

1st breath Quick breath through the nose, ~3 second inhale with a matching exhale.
2nd breath Longer breath with a slow exhale.
3rd breath Is an even longer inhale, almost to capacity.  Then a slow exhale matched with muscle relaxation from the head down to the feet.

It actually works for me.  It centers me, and it allows me to move past whatever was causing the anxiety.

170,How are antidepressants supposed to work?,"I've been on citalopram for four years. When I started it I was 18, and really oblivious to my anxiety. I knew it was happening, but didn't know the scope of the problem, since it's always just been part of me. Now that I'm in CBT and am more aware of when I feel that way I'm not so sure that the citalopram has ever helped. My doctor increased my dose in February, and I never saw a difference.I am now anxious every single day and have recently been prescribed lorazepram and I'm afraid of taking it because I know it can be addictive and it scares me that it almost makes me cry when I take it. It just feels SO good to be semi relieved for a little. I think that I need a change. I feel the worst that I ever have. I'm just not sure how I am supposed to feel while taking medication. I know that nothing will ever take it away completely. For those of you could you possibly explain to me how you feel? ",5,2011-08-15 02:49:18 EDT-0400

177,Desperately need to vent on my anxiety,"**TL;DR: I have had panic/anxiety for 10+ years, and can't leave a 15 mile radius.  Got sick of it decided to fight for my life back, began diet change & exercising, had 30+ pound weight loss, but now have more anxiety than when I accepted defeat and stayed in comfort zone, am now very frustrated.**

I'll try not to be too long winded here.  Even if this generates no responses, I just need to get this off my chest.  I've had anxiety and panic attacks for 10+ years, and am on 150mg of EffexorXR daily. Been to countless specialists, therapists, etc etc.   I'm currently 28 years old, and have been robbed of a lot of wonderful experiences in my life.  The past 3-4 years I just came to accept the fact that anxiety will beat me down no matter how many times I got up.  I've become completely disconnected from friends, spend most of my time at home, but a weird part of me felt better this way.  I didn't experience day-to-day anxiety and panic, and I wasn't depressed or sad.  I also wasn't happy with my lifestyle, but I just seemed to accept my fate.  I could live this way, and wasn't going to poke or prod at the giant elephant in the room, just leave him be.  It crushes me that I really had it all, good grades, great family, etc.  And I had come to a sad, secluded point where I was a human hermit, disconnected and defeated.  My best friend and closest companion was my dog....even typing that crushes me (I love dogs, but that's what my life had come to). 

About two months ago, I decided to fight back.  It's always been in the back of my mind, but one morning, something clicked.  I was 50 pounds overweight, ashamed to be seen by anyone in public, and had just had enough.  Instead of ignoring the giant elephant in the room, I wanted to pick a fight with it.  My attitude suddenly shifted to the following: Anxiety and panic wants to rob me of a life I deserve? *Fuck that*.  I'm not submitting anymore.  Let's go.

My diet went from mainly fast food (food was the one thing I had to look forward to every day) to vegetables, lean meats, whole grains, 1600-2k calories a day.  After two weeks, I began walking.  Two weeks later, I began running.  55 days since my lifestyle change, I'm down 30 pounds, have confidence, a base of proper nutrition and daily exercise as a foundation.  I've inspired my family to change as well.  It really has been amazing.  
This new attitude + lifestyle has led me to expand my boundaries.  I'm walking long distancing out of safe zones, attending some small family gatherings, and very slowly crawling back to a normal life.  The problem is, my panic and anxiety is fighting back as well.  I now experience day to day anxiety and sometimes small episodes of panic, more so than when I accepted my fate of a hermit's lifestyle.  The further I come along and push my boundaries, the harder the anxiety fights back.  Maybe this should just be obvious to me, but after a small panic episode a few hours ago, I felt a bit defeated.  The doubt creeped back into my mind, that maybe I am destined to a hermit lifestyle.  I don't know.  I just needed a place to get all of this off of my chest, even if it goes unread.  For that I thank you.",10,2011-08-19 05:46:21 EDT-0400

For me, my anxiety is triggered by change of routine, the unknown, and loss of control - basically the exact description of an overseas vacation.

181,Advice please - My boyfriend has stopped taking his meds,"Hello. :) I'm using a throwaway account here, as the bf is an avid redditor, and I'm sure he would feel embarrassed or hurt to discover that I am asking advice about him. I really need some advice.

He is 25, and has been diagnosed with social anxiety disorder. He's bee on prozac for at least 5-7 years now, the max dose (60mg?). From what he and his mother have told me, before he started on the meds, he would cut and burn himself, as well as become even more withdrawn and irritable with those around him. I've been with him for about a year and a half, living with him for a year, and I've never seen any symptoms or evidence of these things.

About a month ago, he decided he ""felt better now"", and stopped his prozac cold turkey. Things were fine for about a week, and since then, he has started getting irritable and argumentative about things that were never a problem before, speaking to me less, putting me down a little, and spending a lot more time to himself. I have NOT seen any evidence of renewed self harm, so at this point, I don't think this is something to worry about. 

At first I thought that we were simply have some relationship problems that we needed to discuss, stemming from me having difficulties finding employment (which can stress any relationship) but now I'm not so sure. I don't want to force un needed meds on him, but I'm getting worried.

My question is, how do I discuss this with him without seeming confrontational? I love him very much and want to see him happy and healthy. I've mentioned before that he seems...not himself..lately and that maybe it's because of quitting the prozac, but he brushes the suggestion off. Maybe I came off the wrong way and made it seem confrontational, even though I didn't intend it to be.

Any advice on how to discuss this in a calm, caring maner would be very much appreciated. Thank you so much!",7,2011-08-24 23:50:55 EDT-0400
182,Do I have general anxiety disorder and should I take drugs for it?,"sorry long post but i could really use some suggestions here!

i've been a very anxious person as long as i can remember. i'm a pretty functional person, i have intense social anxiety sometimes but usually i can push through it without it really hindering my speech or actions. i process the world externally and understand people well. but i'm very very often anxious, usually for no good reason. my anxiety seems almost more physical than mental a lot of the time (maybe something else then?). like half the time i'm awake it seems that i have the anxious feeling in my chest for one reason or another, or often no apparent reason. it's a feeling where i feel like i have to take a deep breath to relieve it, but if i'm more than a little anxious that doesn't get rid of the feeling, and even when it does it usually comes right back because i start to think about it. nothing is really bothering me right now, or nothing should be, but as i'm writing and thinking about it it's impossible to make the feeling go away. and the feeling is certainly unpleasant. makes me feel restless as fuck. unless i am very very tired i have trouble sleeping because i get anxious in bed.

I seem to only be able to avoid anxiety when i'm busy or engrossed in something that is at least slightly enjoyable. exercise, studying (when it's not completely boring), reading, creative stuff, cannabis, and alcohol are examples (although i feel no real danger in becoming dependent on either of the latter two, especially not alcohol).

i was wondering if this sounded familiar to anybody, is it general anxiety disorder? and whether you guys would recommend that i try out some drugs or something.",12,2011-03-26 22:29:05 EDT-0400
183,I don't know how to help my girlfriend,"I'm not sure if this is the right subreddit, but if not, I'd be grateful if someone could point me in the right direction.

My girlfriend had a nasty experience with stress when she first went to university, resulting in her coming home after 10 days, taking a year out, then applying to a local university where she could live at home. After that experience, she had counselling and was able to regain most of her shattered confidence and overcome her fears about the future. She was given drugs to help with this (I'm afraid I don't know the name of them).

Since then, she's been doing really well at her new university and, a few months ago, came off the pills (gradually).

However, while she's fine generally, every so often something will cause her to panic/worry/doubt herself and nothing anyone can say can help her relax. For example, today she had a complete blank when entering her PIN at a cash point. I can imagine that forgetting something like that can be very disconcerting, but she ended up with horrible self-doubt and worrying about what this might be the beginning of, what everyone must think of her, etc.. This sort of thing happens every couple of weeks or so. I don't know if it's clinically a panic attack (there's no hyperventilation or anything) but she describes herself feeling tense and her mood changes completely. She's aware she's doing it, but no amount of reassurance can persuade her that she doesn't need to worry.

I hate this situation, since she's suffering with it so much and I feel so powerless to help her. It isn't good for her.

So, any advice? How can I best support her? How can she support herself? Should she look into going back on the medication again? If so, how do I go about suggesting to her without it sounding like I'm saying, ""you're going crazy again, we need drugs to calm you down""?

I'm desperate to be able to do something but I have no idea what I can do. Please help. I know there've been plenty of tears from her, but she doesn't know there've been just as many from me. I don't know what to do.",2,2011-03-27 03:45:28 EDT-0400

192,"Never had anxiety in my life, hit me suddenly one night, now it won't go away.","My entire life I have been fairly care free, and things that I worried about never made me have anxiety as I know it today. I never really knew what anxiety was until it hit me, and now I wish more than anything I could make it go away. 

I can honestly say I know exactly when it happened. I had been a recreational cannabis user for a few months. I smoked everyday, usually at night before I went to bed. It was always euphoric and never had a negative outcome. What began as an elevated heart rate for a few nights, and bit of deep scary thoughts after watching that HBO series Band of Brothers, eventually turned into one night being hit with the most horrible experience in my life. I started feeling tingling in my neck and arms, and began the dreaded racing thoughts of impending doom. I thought it was the start of a heart attack. My chest felt tight, and I couldn't convince myself I was alright. I eventually became very light headed and almost blacked out. I was able to calm a bit and was hit by the worst cold sweats I have ever had. Completely drenched in sweat. After the panic attack subsided, I was left with what I now know as anxiety. I assumed it would be gone after sleeping, and was I ever wrong. Ever since that night, I have had that fleeting pain in my chest, and sometimes a dull pain in my arms. I don't even have any thoughts in my head that would be contributing to the anxiety. It just sits there, in my chest, causing me discomfort and pain that I can't make go away. Some days it's really bad, some days its almost non-existent. I have had very close calls with more panic attacks, but have generally been able to make them go away by convincing myself that I am ok, and I have survived one before.

I had to quit smoking cannabis because it instantly sends me into a panic attack. This doesn't bother me, because like I said I would give anything to make this go away. What bothers me the most is that I really can't even explain what is making me anxious. The only symptoms are physical. The chest pain scares me, it has changed my personality. I used to be lively, extrovert, loved to talk. Now when I have bad days, I can only sit and listen to people talk while I am in my own head trying to figure out what the hell is wrong with me. 

Please reddit, I used to be a happy guy. Now I find myself just wanting to nap because I can't stand to be awake. I can't live with this everyday. The scariest thing is thinking that this may never, ever go away. It's like I am waiting for it to go away, the day it does I expect to feel the most refreshing feeling ever. Sadly, it hasn't happened yet. What do I need to do? ",2,2011-05-14 10:43:05 EDT-0400

It started at 6am, I am half asleep and get up to go to the bathroom. I guess my GF was already up. I get back to bed and lay back down to go back to sleep since I don't have to be up for another hour and a half for work. Literally 2 seconds after I lay down she flings the covers up, jumps out of bed, walks across the room and puts clothes on and storms out of our room to go outside to smoke. She comes back in, lays down facing me. I flip over (so I am not facing her) and I feel the bed start to shake. Then came the whimpering, then full blown hysteria.

The crying continues, I continually ask her what is wrong or what I can do to help. She is sitting up in bed at this point, crying her eyes out. I put my hand on her back to show some concern and she started twitching and screaming and jumped off the bed onto the floor where she repeated crying uncontrollably, shaking and at one point, hitting herself in the head repeatedly saying ""I hate myself, I hate myself, I hate myself"" She starts crying for help so I knelt down and put my arms around her to try and comfort her. At this point I have no idea WTF is going on. She eventually calms down but our whole morning has been devastated. 

We have been seeing couples counseling for the past several months for communication problems. We were supposed to go together tonight but I texted her and told her she should go alone because she needs to talk to someone and get some help.

She refuses to take medication, but at this point Reddit, I don't know how much longer I can keep going like this. It kills me inside that this is some sort of ""disease"" and I can't help, but at the same time I have no idea what I should do/don't do. I can only describe the scenario as what I have seen closest to it and that is a little 4 year old boy having a tempur tantrum on his parents floor (that I witnessed at a friends house) and that is the closest I can describe it, except way freaking worse when she is hitting herself and saying she doesn't want to live.

If anyone could shed some light on the subject of anxiety, maybe some supportive comments or something. At this point im about to throw out a relationship with a girl I love because I just can't take this anymore. 

*Edit to add: My GF has been prescribed drugs in the past (I think welbutrin?) but she hated it. She doesn't have insurance or any money to see a specialist so we are kinda screwed on those options.

198,So hows it going with you? Talking helps. Let's talk about everything that we can't talk about with our friends.,"I'm particularly curious if anyone's else here has serious job-related anxieties. I'm thinking a nice chat about them would make us feel better about them. 

As for myself, I got fired a month ago for from my position as a clerical administrator due to inaccuracies in my work. I was in that position in the first place because I've been too anxious for years to pursue something either related to my degree (marketing) or something I'd really like to do, like computer programming.

Since then I've moved 13 hours away to a town where I know no-one but my girl friend, who is attending college here. I'm actually sneak-living in her dorm room, which is fine since she's in a single in a building where people keep to themselves and you hardly ever see another resident. Still, if her RA gets suspicious I'm kicked out into the freezing weather. I was smart to move! Yay! It was kind of a spur of the moment, I just got fired, move or /r/sucidewatch decision. I decided to moved.

Anyways, my resume simultaneously isn't that bad but I've never stayed in a job for more than a year, and I clench up thinking about having to answer for myself in an interview situation. I'm also trying to find a psychiatrist and a therapist out here, since I've been cowering in our room for the past week and I obviously need help.

On top of all this, I've been diagnosed with adult ADHD, inattentive subtype, and while this goes a long way towards explaining why I've been inaccurate, I still feel like I'm a pile of poop and unhirable, which is a terrible attitude that makes it pretty much impossible to even look at job listings.

Whew, feel better already. So. What's going on with you?

edit:

Random update, a month later. Just completed my first week on Adderall. It feels like I'm on a caffeine high all the time, which is just about the best possible result. When I had enough caffeine in my system, I felt like I could actually prioritize my thoughts and could get stuff done. It's pretty awesome.

It came just in time, too, because I got a job in a call center. That's pretty weird for me, because I have anxieties about the phone in particular. Worse still is that I'm responsible for answering customer questions using some antiquated DOS looking thing that's crazy complex. The good news is that I've had a week of classroom training on taking calls, and the first couple of days you either navigate the computer screens or talk to the customer while a veteran does the other. Then I'll be in a classroom for the rest of that week and the next week with a single veteran between 3 other new hires. They really ease you in. I'm procrastinating on studying my notes for the computer system in prep of starting tomorrow morning with live calls. But I'll dig in and I'll get interested and I'll be well prepared.

199,"ADD, anxiety, long story, edited xpost from offmychest","I'm going to be as vague as I can be without killing my story because you never know who reads Reddit and I'm terrified someone might come along and know who I am. I'm also going to say it right here and right at the top: I am not suicidal. I am still a rational person and am gravely afraid of death. Crazy, but not stupid.

I don't know where to begin. I guess I'll start by saying a few things about myself. I'm a young male. I abhor drugs. I never drink. I'm very law abiding. I'm atheist. I am incredibly disorganized. I lose focus at the drop of a hat. I am a master of irrelevant information. I know something about just about everything, but I only know everything about certain specific things. I suppose that's a hallmark of ADD. The ability to start a million different things at once but finish none of them. Then theres the hyperfocus that comes with ADD that allows me to intently focus on one thing and one thing only for days on end. I was placed into every gifted program at every school I ever went to, then I was blamed for not excelling in my regular studies. Well, obviously. Why the hell would I want to take English when my gifted studies class is learning programming and making games? I wound up dropping out, getting a meaningless job, going back to school a year later and getting my diploma.

Several years ago, I moved far away from where I grew up. I made the decision to move out and away from my parents so as to shun their support and make myself fly so to speak. I moved almost a thousand miles away to a city I've never been before. I rented a basement, got a job, and the 'high' of being on my own masked the impending depression and anxiety that was due to set in.

I did well at my job. I even went on business trips for them. I forgot I was still a retail peon, even if I was distinguished somewhat. I went on an epic road trip and after, depression started to set in. I missed the good times I had with my friend on the road trip. I missed my friends. I missed home.

The next couple of months was rough for me at work. Being in this strange city began to take its toll on me. I had to leave. I had no friends and the depression was unbearable.

So I went back to the city I used to live in. I found a place and moved in with a friend for a roommate.  It was at this point that my anxiety began to kick in. I began having panic attacks. Terrified, I saw a doctor and was prescribed Ativan. I changed my diet and removed caffeine. It would seem they brought it on. So my prescription for Ativan ran out, but I dealt with the anxiety without them. My panic attacks were a thing of the past, anyhow.

I decided to go back to school. So I started going back to college and immediately found I wasn't going to go anywhere because of my ADD. It was really bad. I went to see a doctor about getting ritalin. I had taken it as a child, but stopped as I felt too spaced out and like a zombie on it. But now I needed it more than ever. But my doctor had a problem with prescribing it to me. I was morbidly obese and had very high blood pressure. He wanted me to monitor my blood pressure and get it down to an acceptable level before he would prescribe the ritalin.

So I cut salt from my diet. Actually, I cut just about everything from my diet. I was 345lbs and loved food. But the hyperfocus part of my ADD kicked in and treated it like something I wanted to do. So I kept to it and in two weeks I was able to bring my blood pressure down enough to be prescribed ritalin. He said it would help with the weight too.

So I took that first tablet. It was like taking it for the first time. I felt... motivated. I wanted to see how effective it was so I cleaned my vehicle. I cleaned the FUCK out of it. I was spaced out and zombiefied, devoid of all emotion. I just wanted to do it and my body said, ""sure thing, boss"". Once I was done I went in my room and didn't know what to think. Doing something like that for someone with ADD is incredibly hard. It's like trying to lift a mountain. It was incredibly monumental and fulfilling to me.

And so I continued taking ritalin, my doctor increasing the dosage. My weight began to plummet. I started going for walks. I began to take control of my life. I had patience and could focus on things and complete them. Then I began to starve myself using the ritalin. By not feeling hungry, I didn't give in to cravings.

Now I had planned to move back to the city I failed in those years ago. I had ritalin and I was thinner and this time I'll make it work! I drove 20 hours through hell, but arrived safely.

After arriving in the city, I became emotionally numb. I took it as a good thing because I ought to be feeling nervous. I stayed with a friend and told him what I was doing. He called me an idiot. ""You're killing yourself, you keep blacking out. Eat something!""  He was right. Every time I had a hunger pang, I responded to it by taking ritalin. That's how I fed myself. And I was waisting away. At 265lbs, I was still obese. I had set a goal of 175lbs, and I intended to meet it. ""Yeah, so what happens when you hit 175lbs? Are you going to eat again?"" I never gave it much thought. Would I have to decide between the ritalin and my weight? By now I realized it. I probably had anorexia. I'm a big guy, a little anorexia should be good for you, right? I still don't know what's going to happen when I hit 175lbs. The answer seems simple and I'm a rational person, but eating disorders are anything but rational.

Driving through the city the next day, I felt a panic attack coming on. The numbness I had enjoyed the past few days were gone and the realization of my situation began to hit me. What the hell was I doing in a strange city and nearly no support group? I used rational thinking to stave off the attack. Sleep times got pushed further into the night as insomnia kicked in.

I went to see a doctor. I explained that I had insomnia and some anxiety and I was asked if I wanted an anti anxiety med. I always hated drugs. Accepting the ativan a few years ago opened the floodgates into accepting the ritalin. Even though I wasn't being offered ativan, I thought about the fact that I was relying on drugs. I managed to choke out a depressed sounding no and asked for something to sleep. I am no drug addict, I convinced myself.

I got a place at a hotel for a couple days while my apartment application was being approved. I gave in and tried the zopiclone. I wound up stumbling around, hallucinating, and waking up drugged, Chrome opened to a bunch of reddits I didn't remember opening.

I went back to the clinic. I told the doctor I felt drunk, drugged, hallucinated and felt like shit. He wrote me up a prescription for trazodone. He told me it was an anti-depressant but it was sedating. ""great...."" I murmured. In for a penny in for a pound. I was going to use drugs to treat myself. I decided that when I took the ritalin, why should I be upset about this? I did feel better when on these drugs. That was the point, right? But it went against one of my core beliefs. 

So I went home, tried the trazodone and waited. And waited. And waited. I caved and took a zopiclone and instantly went to sleep. I woke up feeling like a boss. None of this tossing and turning half awake for an hour until I had the courage to get out of bed. I just got up and felt completely refreshed.

So I went on for a couple days like this, fighting the anxiety as best as I could. I moved into my new place. But I could ignore it no longer. I had anxiety and depression. I started shunning public places. I had a friend who was agoraphobic. I watched him turn from an outgoing person into a recluse who had very few ""safe zones"". And THIS terrified me. I had seen what anxiety had done to my best friend. It crippled him. I had seen the unused drugs in the open at his house. He refused to take them because it made him feel tired. I couldn't understand his condition at the time. I encouraged to him to come out. I knew what agoraphobia was, but to understand it you have to have it.

I forced myself to endure crowded malls and interactions with other people. I did it subconsciously at first, fighting the anxiety. As if to say, ""What? I'm not afraid, damn right I'll go over there and start a conversation!""

Yesterday I accepted that I had anxiety. I am always thinking that the people I interact with and those around myself are judging me negatively. The sleeping aid I was prescribed was a very tiny dose of antidepressant and didn't do anything. I did research and I came to the conclusion I needed serious treatment. I saw a doctor yesterday. I was put on Cipralex. I think he knew there was a serious problem forming that the other doctor didn't see. I had my first dose yesterday and I know it'll be a few weeks before I see results. He told me to follow up in four weeks.

So here I am, the obese anorexic drug addict. I've lost nearly ninety pounds since starting the ritalin. I'm on anti depressants and sleeping pills. I'm alone in a strange, yet familiar city away from family and friends. Defying my core beliefs. Using drugs to overcome my short comings, deluding myself from the real world. I already know I can't live without the ritalin. I look like a normal person from the outside, but inside I'm a mess.

I require the ritalin to function: to be even somewhat organized. And even when I stopped taking it for awhile, my eating disorder remained; I am afraid of food now. Is Cipralex effective? Will it help me through this? Or are more drugs bad?

What the hell should I do? I feel as if I'm at the bottom of a dark pit and I'm making all the wrong decisions, but I can't stop and I don't have a guide.
