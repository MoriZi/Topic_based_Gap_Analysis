0,"[UPDATE] after almost canceling a job interview due to anxiety, I forced myself to go, went in there, and killed it!!!","I GOT AN OFFER!!!!!!

I went back to pessimism and expecting the worst after a few days of not hearing back, but I did today, and they offered me the job!!!!! Higher pay, almost double the PTO, amazing benefits... I‚ÄôM JUST SO EXCITED!!!! 

I know on my first day I‚Äôm gonna have massive anxiety and second guess everything and wish I stayed in my comfort zone but I don‚Äôt even care because this just proves to me that if I push through those nasty feelings I really can do anything!!

Thank you so so so much to everyone that gave such kind words of support and encouragement. This has been a HUGE life changing step for me and it‚Äôs amazing to be able to share it with all of y‚Äôall.

Edit: I promise I‚Äôm done bragging on myself after this but I just negotiated a (slightly, not by much but still!) higher salary as well! I‚Äôm over the moon, I can‚Äôt believe I‚Äôm me and I did this haha. 

Thank y‚Äôall, the support in this sub is unbelievable and I‚Äôm so glad these posts were able to motivate people. :) every single one of y‚Äôall has it in you!",125,2019-07-03 02:52:59 EDT-0400

14,Important things I learned in my recovery from anxiety,"About 9 years ago I hit my rock bottom. I was having multiple panic attacks a day. I couldn‚Äôt eat or sleep. I was isolated socially. My doctor almost sent me to inpatient. I had to take 6 months off work.  I have come along way since then. I haven‚Äôt had a full blown panic attack in years. I work a full time job, attend part time grad school, and am engaged to be married,  anxiety is still a daily part of my life, but I‚Äôve learned how to function better and not let it control me.  

I wanted to share somethings I learned on my journey.  These are things that took time to fully embrace and make habits. I still struggle with some. I don‚Äôt expect anyone to read this and it changes then right away. I guess that leads to the first lesson. 
 
1) This is a process. There are no easy answers but putting in the time and effort can result in change. 

2) my brain is trying to trick me. I had to learn when I can trust it and when it‚Äôs lying to me. And when I realize it‚Äôs lying I know I need to re-evaluate and use coping techniques 

3) I can‚Äôt wait until I feel better or less anxious to change my behavior. Changing my behavior is what changes how I feel. My therapist always said: the same behavior leads to the same feelings. 

4) I had to let go of the mindset of fighting the anxiety or trying to make it go away. It feels awful and you want to ‚Äúfix it‚Äù but that only makes it worse. I try to think of it as managing and accepting my anxiety. 

5) avoidance is a drug and my anxiety makes me an addict. Addicts take drugs to temporarily feel better but they aren‚Äôt addressing what they are trying to escape and only making the problem worse. That‚Äôs how avoidance works. I get temporary relief but then I feel worse and it doesn‚Äôt help me learn to manage my anxiety 

6) I have the right to ask for help and for what I need.  This isn‚Äôt a problem I have to face on my own. I have the right to ask for help and support from doctors, friends, family, coworkers. 

7) I had to learn to do the opposite of what my anxiety tells me to do. If someone asks me go somewhere and my instinct is to avoid it, that means I should probably do it. That‚Äôs how I learned that my brain was lying to me.  This doesn‚Äôt mean you have to do things you don‚Äôt want to do if you actually don‚Äôt want to do it for reasons besides anxiety 

8) I can function even when anxious. The anxiety can‚Äôt hurt me. It can make me really uncomfortable but I‚Äôm not in danger and I can still do what I need to do. 

9) just because I ‚Äúfeel‚Äù something is true doesn‚Äôt mean in reality it is actually true. I may feel I embarrassed myself at a social gathering, but in reality no one else thought i did anything embarrassing.  I had to learn how to challenge the feeling with reality based evidence

10) MOST IMPORTANT.  Treat yourself with self compassion. We are the hardest on ourselves and say things to ourselves that we wouldn‚Äôt dare say to someone else. Try to change that self talk. You are trying your best. You deserve happiness and love. You have right to make mistakes. You have the right to forgive yourself when you let your anxiety get the best of you,

If I think of more, I‚Äôll add them. I‚Äôm open to questions too

15,Does your anxiety get worse after being too social?,"I have a question because I'm not sure if this is just me. I've always had social anxiety, even since I was a really little kid. The farthest back I can remember having anxiety about interacting with people was around 5yo. I remember around 13, I wouldn't be able to walk down the same sidewalk if someone was coming the other way. I'd cross the street so I wouldn't have to interact with them. 

Now for my adult life, I'm still experiencing it I think. I talk to people easily now but I have something I can only describe as a rebound effect. 

I can talk to someone and have a really great conversation but then for the next few days have anxiety and panic attacks because I feel almost like I gave too much of myself away, even if the conversation was totally normal. It's not like I become very vulnerable at all. It's like if anyone knows anything more than bare basics about me or my perspectives or behaviors, I feel like I have to hide from the world. 

Does anyone else experience this? 

I'm definitely going to talk to my therapist about it next time I see him, but I wanted some advice.",27,2019-07-01 04:36:48 EDT-0400

19,I just managed to shift from a heart rate of 130 bpm and being completely terrified to a heart rate of 83 bpm and being completely calm simply by doing a 3 minute guided meditation - NO medication!

20,I‚Äôve found a way to help my anxiety and it‚Äôs the way I didn‚Äôt think would ever work.,"I had to take a night job(I have two kids and a husband ) working 8pm-230am. The past week I have been having break through anxiety through my medication. 

Over time I have figured out my anxiety triggers. Lack of sleep, too much caffeine, stress and health anxiety are mine.  Well, working nights and up in the mornings with kids, you sure get exhausted fast. 
I would hate when people would say ‚Äúgive into your anxiety‚Äù ‚Äúride it out‚Äù blah blah. I would tell myself ‚Äúyeah OK. That doesn‚Äôt work‚Äù and just continue to freak out, panic and thinking I‚Äôm about to die. Because that is obviously better than listening to advice.

Last night, we were slammed at work. I waitress and I had to run back and fourth between about 30 customers and two bottle service tables. Dark lighting, strobe lights, the worst environment for anxiety. While serving one of the tables I could see an ocular migraine starting. (Seeing lights in my vision) 
Usually, I would panic. Freak out. Thinking I was about to have a stroke or a seizure. But I have into my anxiety. I knew I have had this happen before to me and I didn‚Äôt die. So I told myself mentally, I wouldn‚Äôt die this time. I took a moment to myself in the bathroom and gave into it. I took ‚Äúujjayi breathes‚Äù which I had learned a few days prior. It means ocean breathing. I suggest googling on how to do it! It‚Äôs a life changer. Told myself, ‚Äúyou know what this is. Don‚Äôt let it go any further. It‚Äôs anxiety. You‚Äôre tired, you‚Äôre stressed. Don‚Äôt let it trigger you to more.‚Äù As I calmed my breathing, spoke to myself, the lights in my vision slowly went away. My HR slowly started going back to normal. My body and mind relaxed. I felt calm. And it was over. I rode out my anxiety/panic attack. I felt victorious. I finally felt like I won and I could over come my anxiety. 

I don‚Äôt know if anyone will read this or take anything away from it. But I‚Äôve been suffering with anxiety for 16 years and I finally feel like I made a break through on it. Also, I have been listening to a podcast called ‚Äúthe anxiety coaches‚Äù and listening to it before work and when I want to calm and relax my body sure has been helping!

Hope this helps ‚ù§Ô∏è",9,2019-06-30 23:22:09 EDT-0400

23,Anxiety is ruining my life.,"I've had anxiety my entire life, although it only got very serious starting late junior year of high school. As a result of my anxiety I am constantly sick to my stomach, lost 60 pounds in a year by just not being able to eat, and have severe anxiety spikes from literally everything. Even dreaming which used to be a time of peace for me has become a spot for my brain to wake me up, sick from anxiety because of my dreams. I cant go out with friends because the thought of it makes me puke. I cant text my friends because the thought of it makes me puke. I got sick in the car once when I was eight, now the thought of being in a car makes me sick. I dont even know how to deal with this anymore. Almost everything in my life gives me crippling levels of anxiety and I just cant deal with it.

I was prescribed antidepressants for anxiety last year but was too anxious to take them lol. I want to try get them again, is it worth it? I'd most likely be on a low dose of citalopram (UK).

I tried therapy (CBT) it did nothing for me. I find it hard to implement the behavioural techniques you learn at therapy.",10,2019-12-10 23:36:29 EST-0500

29,I think I might try to start keeping a record of every major in-school freakout I have.,"I am in middle school currently. Occasionally, I end up having a bit of a, I don't know how to word this, ""freakout."" Like I get frustrated or something, overly stressed, other things. Occasionally I can keep myself under enough control that I can stay in the classroom. Sometimes I have to leave for a few minutes to calm down. Well, my parents know that they happen, its been a problem for as long as I can remember, but I never tell them nowadays when it happens, so I think I might start making a log of ever major time it happens(like today, where I got way too frustrated during History and had to leave for a few minutes to calm down).

31,How do you deal with the regret that anxiety has made you 'miss out'?,"So I've been dealing with really intense regret the last few years. Some quick background:

Moved out of my parents house in my 3rd year of uni and lived by myself for the first time. Had my first panic attack one night, that spiralled into constant anxiety symptoms, depression, chest pain, crying. Got diagnosed with GAD soon afterwards, and have been dealing with it since. This has taken the form of therapy, meds and group therapy.

I'm 33 now and I've spent loads of the past 13 years fighting against my anxiety. Once my anxiety came on in my early 20s, it became harder to make friends. It really destroyed my self-esteem and made me feel so unlikeable. I feel I always have a guard up and find it difficult to make meaningful connections. The severe anxiety took a toll of the way I acted and many of my friendships in college fell apart. I'm envious of seeing my friends with their circles of close friends, having fun, and I just feel like I'm too old and anxious to really make a change. Even at work, I feel my coworkers are much closer with eachother and I'm kind of the misfit. I missed out on partying/socializing in my 20s because I was just too busy dealing with my anxiety. I don't travel because I'm terrified of airplanes. I have awful health anxiety which really limits what I allow myself to do out of fear. I didn't drink until I was 25 because I was scared of alcohol and what could happen. And now, I can no longer drink because of the anti-depressants so that social lubricant I enjoyed is gone.

I just keep thinking about how so many people got to really enjoy their 20s and foster friendships with others. I try so hard not to wallow in regret because I know it's a waste of time, but it's hard not to beat up on myself and feel lonely and hopeless. I know I should be grateful for what I have, and part of my problem is that I am deeply pessimistic. But I figure others here can relate - How do you deal with these thoughts and feelings?",13,2019-12-13 03:28:21 EST-0500

43,23M starting university in new year,"I'm 23M from South africa. Going back to university next year full time for a degree im passionate about . 
Worried about being too old and still dependent 
Been to university for 2 years previously  and dropped as I got sick and that's when anxiety and depression set it . Am on medication for clinical depression and anxiety and doing great actually. 
However I left my full time job to pursue this and in my gut I know it's right.  I'm living with my parents comfortably , have my own car, go to gym- will feel a bit of guilt considering I'm gonna he leaching for a few years . ( the degree I'm gonna complete will allow me to get a better salary significantly and is quiet easy to get a job with)

Now the advise needed- 
- I start college in late JAN , what do I do with my time until then and my mind races and i get headaches at times from overstressing. 
- I've isolated myself from friends and actually don't  enjoy going out with them. Enjoy being hy myself or one friend somewhere quiet and not busy",0,2019-12-12 21:04:07 EST-0500

I guess I need to have gratitude where its warranted. I've come so far on this journey through GAD. I need to love myself and be grateful for all my progress. And yet it's so hard to forgive myself for all I've let my anxiety taint.

1. Had to deal with my anti-vaxxing ex today at my daughters physical.
2. Phone wasn‚Äôt working properly so gf who also has anxiety/depression wasn‚Äôt able to FaceTime me.
3. Picked up my son ,When I did talk to gf, she gets disappointed to the point I feel guilty, that I can‚Äôt come visit her (45 min drive she comes down every weekend).
4. Went to cash check, deposit small amount into gfs account (same small bank) because she‚Äôs 45 mins away and can‚Äôt get her check until Friday and needed groceries (we work at the same place) . She get angry I messed with her account at all (even though I was given 0 access to her account. Just was able to deposit because the banker knows us both.)
5. Apologize and have an anxiety flair because I‚Äôm messaging gfs roommate/sister about how I screwed up and how to rectify it.

Just today, I was having a conversation, and an uncomfortable topic came up, and boom, suddenly I feel super anxious all day. I feel like I have sensory overload, I feel disconnected from reality. I often tend to start shaking and hyperventilating, sometimes almost having a complete mental breakdown. However, as I said, the strangest part about all this is how it just randomly comes and goes.

69,Advice on Anxiety with Past Relationship,"Hey guys, I'm new to Reddit, and am not sure exactly how this all works. Basically, I'm going to tell a little bit about what's been happening in my life and asking for any advice.

&#x200B;

My ex-girlfriend and I dated for a year and half. We honestly never fought. It was a great break from my previous relationship. I was incredibly happy with her, and our relationship even lasted through the first year of college. Even though I did not want to be attached to someone going into college (we do not go to the same college), she changed my mind through her great personality and kindness.

&#x200B;

Over Thanksgiving, we saw each other, and everything seemed fine. However, later that week we met up and she told me she couldn't do the relationship anymore. She said she was not in the right headspace to be in a relationship, even with anyone at the moment. She said that she lost feelings for me :( not due to her disliking something about me, but because of her own personal issues. She assured me that it wasn't because she was seeing anyone at school. I was heartbroken (and still am). I'm only 20, but I can seriously see myself starting a family and doing everything with this girl. She's wonderful, and there's nothing about her where I could justify myself and say I'm better off without her. I love her so much, and that's why I need some advice.

&#x200B;

My entire life I've dealt with anxiety, and more notably OCD. It isn't the OCD where everything must be neat, but more where letting anything go (like a bad thought) is damn near impossible for me. When we broke up, I went hyperactive and started texting and calling her more, pleading to give us a chance and that whatever she was going through I could help her through. None of it worked, and I ultimately feel like I pushed her away more, which only made my general anxiety much worse.

&#x200B;

It's been two months now, and I still miss her like crazy. I grew very close with her dad from the time I met her, and her dad reassured me that she isn't interested in someone else, and even told me that he could see me and her back together in the summer. My mind has been going crazy since the break up. I check her social media where this one guy at her school likes literally everything of hers. I'm trying my best to stop looking at it, but it's pretty hard not to. I keep thinking anxiously about the future and how if I see her over the summer, she may not redevelop feelings again. I also keep thinking of her eventually meeting someone or developing feelings at school with someone else. These thoughts have been driving me crazy, and I'm trying to stop them and be healthy. She doesn't want me contacting her for a while either, but she did say to have any hope of a relationship again one day, to be healthy and give her space. That's why me getting better is extremely important to me. I would really appreciate some advice on how to get through this. Again, this isn't just some random girl to me, she's the girl. Thank you for reading and for any responses :)

73,Does anyone else ever get worried that they‚Äôre subconciously faking their own anxiety?,"I really hope this makes sense and maybe somebody can relate to this so I don‚Äôt feel alone, and maybe it‚Äôs because I‚Äôve seen people fake mental issues for attention or sympathy or as a way to get out of something but I get so worried that I‚Äôve psyched myself into being this way even if I know that‚Äôs not the case but I still freak out over it.

I was kind of overdramatic about a situation and I got emotional and said something I regret and I hold myself accountable for it but my mom made a comment about how ‚ÄúI know I‚Äôll get sympathy if I freak out more‚Äù and I genuinely couldn‚Äôt control me freaking out even more over a situation so little. It confirmed my worst fears of what people could think about me, which is that I‚Äôm faking my anxiety. I know I shouldn‚Äôt care, and I try not to but I feel like the process of actively trying not to care what people think makes me mad at myself for feeling this way.



I just feel so frustrated with myself because I‚Äôm in this cycle of thinking that I shouldn‚Äôt feel this anxious about a situation because even the slightest pressure can make me freak out and I get mad at myself causing me to freak out even more even when it‚Äôs such a small situation.

77,A friendly reminder.,"You're not dying. Those aches and pains you're feeling? Normal. Those muscle spasms in your chest and all around your body? Normal. Feeling like your heart/chest is being squeezed? Also normal. Feeling like you can't breathe/aren't getting enough air/like something is stuck in your throat? Normal. Your heart is pounding and occasionally skipping? You guessed it, also normal. Those feelings of dread and like everything is gonna go wrong? Yep, normal and goes hand in hand with all these sensations when we're too aware of them. 100% of the sensations you're feeling and going through are normal in every day life, We're just unfortunately hyper aware of them. We feel a pain or uncomfortable sensation and our minds immediately go to the worst possible scenario, death, but that won't be the outcome. These things may be scary and uncomfortable, but they won't be the death of us. We've felt them numerous times before and haven't dropped dead then, we won't drop dead now. Stay strong everyone.

She took me back to the X-Ray room, and instead of prepping me for it, she told me that she had anxiety also, and she was willing to let me sit for a while to calm down. We talked for a while, and she told me I was very strong. She told me that she knows the struggles of anxiety as well, and they are very real. She actually started crying a bit, and I asked if I could hug her, which she accepted.

94,I survived my first breakup!,"Not just survived, but I'm doing really okay. We met on Reddit, spent two years long distance before I moved to his city for grad school. I was out there for almost two years and this week, it ended. The relationship was plagued with so much anxiety, much of it irrational on my part. I used him as my anxiety security blanket, and he just soaked it all up and bottled it up without communicating until it became too much on top of his other stress. We definitely both love and care for each other, but our compatibility and timing in life is just off. The relationship was unfulfilling for me (mainly due to lack of quality time together), and I was incredibly lonely and depressed. I am so proud of myself though, I did so many scary things in these past 1.5 years, despite my anxiety! I moved out of my parent's house, moved five hours away alone, got my masters, had a long-term relationship, ended a long-term relationship... and I survived it all.

I get the feeling that my manger doesn't like me and thinks I'm stupid, and I don't know if it's in my head or not. Whenever I raise a point or ask a question I feel that people just look at me as if I'm stupid before answering.  I feel like people use a different tone of voice when explaining things to me.  
I just keep thinking that I'm not good enough and not living up to expectations.  I was recommended for this job and given extremely high praise which played a part in me getting it, but I can't help thinking that I've turned out to be a disappointment and haven't been living up to that praise.  I know I'm not terrible.  But I make small mistakes and I forget to do things sometimes and I shouldn't be, because I hav pe enough experience to not me making mistakes.  

I struggle with thoughts if my manager not liking me the most and because of this find it quite awkward to make conversation and be in the same room alone, which I'm sure doesn't help her feelings about me.  My previous job I worked under someone who was very hard on me to the point of bullying and I seem to be transferring my fears about that person to my current manager.

106,My 20 yr old sister is afraid to sleep alone..,"My twin and I have always been close but I would say that I am more independent than her. For as long as I can remember, she's always been in a scared state. I remember as kids we used to walk home from our elementary school which was only a block away and if she saw a grown up on the other side of the street or walking our way she'd drop all that she had and run home into our house. Then around the age of 11 she began to have a sudden fear of our dad who is probably the most charismatic person in our household, he jokes around a lot and there would be no reason for her to be scared but she was. Whenever my dad found a new route to go home she would freak out thinking that he would take us somewhere and murder us, and multiple times throughout the night she would wake me up because she was scared and thought she ""heard"" something breathing under our bed. 

I obviously tried to be brave and although I knew this was all in her head her worries always made me think if the worst things happening. Because of her scared state of mind, we have always had to share a bed and room. And we always slept with the hallway light on. If I ever got up to use the restroom at the middle of the night she would run to the switch and turn it on. We're 20 now and in college. We spent our first 2 years in the dorm and now we live in an apartment but still, she continues to sleep in my bed. It's a twin bed so it can be uncomfortable at times. And to top it off she still wakes me up multiple times to ask if I heard something or to tell me she had a bad dream. Sometimes on the nights where shes really scared she asks me to hold her hand or even hug her. 

&#x200B;

If I'm being honest I don't mind that I have to be there for her but sometimes I just want to sleep peacefully. And we've talked about how her doing this is selfish but she really doesn't care and continues to have this scared state of mind. I don't know why she's scared and don't know how she would resolve this issue.",6,2019-02-08 01:33:27 EST-0500

My mum is trying to treat it as if we are living together as much as possible, making excuses to come in and see me be that to do my washing, bring in a meal or invite me over to hers or out for lunch.

I have a very hard time saying No to her. If I have a plan for the day and she invites me to do something then I feel anxious saying No and sticking to my plan. I feel compelled to be abandon my plan so as not to upset her, I feel I have to justify the plan as work or something jobs related. I know that it is acceptable to be unavailable because I'm seeing friends but not acceptable to be planning to go to the gym.

My anxiety about saying no to her is partly because Mum would stonewall me and refuse to help me as a teenager if I challenged her. The other is that I worried her by being very depressed and having an eating disorder during my young adulthood years. Since we both got therapy for an anxiety disorder she's been super-compensating for that, plus it is in her disposition to be anxious anyway.

The last time I talked about 'boundaries' and 'independence' to her she told me to ""stop talking like that, you sound like your dad"" and we fell out without her explaining it. I then felt a need to get her a thank you present for helping me around the flat and basically dropped the issue of having space altogether just to keep the peace.

I'm honestly not used to having to invest so much time in a parent, my dad was pretty chill about when he saw me or not. I also get frustrated because my brother gets away with only calling home 6 weeks whereas I have to check in every 24 hours and see them every week (especially Mum, and ideally twice or more.)

tl;dr Struggling holding boundaries with Mum due to history.. Do you have advice for how to change this?",0,2019-02-08 02:34:27 EST-0500

She hasn't left the house and works at home because she doesn't want to be around people, she thinks people are judging her and that she should be doing more, no matter how much I tell her things are alright and be there, I can't seem to help.

Lately she seems lonely and wants to spend all her time with me, and I always do, but I'm not sure if I'm making it better or worse, I could use some advice if anyone is willing to spare the time to comment, thank you!",3,2019-02-07 21:39:22 EST-0500
110,Been on and off sertraline and this last time i tried taking it really messed me up.,"Quick backstory, I've been on and off sertraline for years now.  I get off when I think I'm feeling better and can manage life without it but then I get back on cause I realize I need them again.  I recently weaned my way off about 4 months ago and was feeling good but then all of the negative thoughts slowly kept coming back to me and I decided I wanted to get back on ssri's again.  I got my old bottle of sertraline and only took 25mg of one.  I was out later that night at a family event and ended up having the worst anxiety attack in the bathroom that I've had for a long time.  Couldn't think, couldn't concentrate, just felt empty and the days after I had the same feeling.  I work at a restaurant so I need to be able to at least pretend to be happy with the customers but I couldn't even do that.  I had a full bledged panic attack on the way home from work a few days ago where I was hyperventilating and crying and couldn't stop for a good 30 minutes.  Went and saw the doctor today and she recommended me to a psychiatrist.  Has anyone else had an experience like this with getting back into an ssri?  ",1,2019-02-08 02:42:20 EST-0500

113,Confrontation makes me look like a liar,"Today my boss walks up and asks why there was a setting on my email account that gave me access to a colleague's account. When I started this position, I took over the previous person's computer, email address, desk...everything and I had NO IDEA that it was linked to someone else. This poses a huge security threat and I can't help but think that my boss has the impression that I was the cause of it.

I know to myself that it isn't true but when I get confronted with something my anxiety soars and it mimics what a horrible liar's reaction would be: flushed face, stammering, can't hold eye contact, etc. making me look guilty.

This anxious reaction only fuels more anxiety about how I came across and it will consume my day worrying about how this could have potentially affected my career.

Any ideas on how to manage situations like that? ",1,2019-02-07 23:56:34 EST-0500

136,Am I on the borderline of having an anxiety disorder?,"I'm a 23y.o girl, since middle school I like to imagine these scripts in my head, creating a drama or movie on my own. Part of it maybe because I'm too imaginative  and part of it because I was just bored. But whenever the script turns to the worst moments, I tend to have this crying fits to the point that I'm having trouble breathing. It never last more than 15 minutes. And since after crying I feel like weights being lift off my shoulder, I kinda make it a habit of mine to cry my eye out at least once a week.

To this day, I still have this habit. But these past few weeks I think I had my first panic attack. Things happen in my university and out of stress I cried in front of my friends. They managed to calm me down and the crying stops eventually.

But when I came home, before bed I can't help but rethink about the cause that made me cried earlier. And that was when I know something feel different than my usual crying fit. I can't breath, I feel dizzy, I can feel numbness or tingling sensation on my face, my hands were trembling and feel cold. My room was a bit far from my parents so they didn't hear my ugly crying noise. Not that I want them to find out their daughter might have a mental health issue either so I don't bother reach out to anyone. I can't calm myself down so I search those asmr panic attack comfort videos in YouTube and it helped.

I had the same panic attack kind of moment yesterday but a mini one and the trigger is more like the same like the last one. I know how serious it is to have a mental health disorder and I'm not belittling those who have it. I'm just curious that maybe my way on how to cope with stress by crying my eyes out might create a situation that mimics a panic attack. Am I on the verge of having a panic disorder? Or am I just overreacting? Should I be wary of future possible panic attacks?",1,2019-12-23 08:09:12 EST-0500
137,Are these linked?,"I (16M) had dealt with really bad anxiety since 8th grade, and have suddenly experienced a really major flare up not unlike how I was before I went to therapy. For about the last 2 months I could barely sleep because my mind won't shut down, and if I did sleep it was a very bad sleep/full of nightmares. I have very bad intrusive thoughts that won't give me rest, and as a result I can barely function with things like cooking myself food (something I really love doing) and brushing my teeth, let alone school work and classes.

Since this flare up, I have also experienced a very sharp decline in my physical fitness. Twice a week since july I do krav maga, and ever since the flare up I could barely do the first 20 minutes of the workout, and then couldn't keep going, I go extremely pale and can't balance, and I feel like I'm going to pass out, so I wanted to ask, are these somehow connected?

I've been constantly asking my parents for another appointment with my psychiatrist, both because I can barely function and also because I have been really suicidal, but my mom only now started making the appointment and the psychiatrist is too busy to even see the message.

I want to ask her about being an outpatient until this thing calms down because I don't want to risk another attempt but until then I at least want to know if this is connected and if so how to bring this up to my mom because I've been essentially lying about/avoiding this topic ever since the flare up and she isn't the most patient of people.

Tl ; dr I've been experiencing very bad anxiety symptoms again and I think it has taken a toll on my physical health as well, but I want to be sure.

A fear of being stuck in a situation, having a panic attack, and not being able to escape. It strike at the most annoying time and for the dumbest reasons. Today I ordered a drink at Starbucks and started to feel the panic setting in as I was waiting for my drink. I felt trapped cuz I couldn't leave until I got my drink and there was a lot of people around. Then the 20min drove home was almost the exact same. I felt trapped in my car, in traffic, the rain made it worse somehow.

I know I'm fine and I try to take deep breaths, but it doesn't really help all that much. I still feel my heart speed up, my throat get tight, and my body get antsy. It usually hits me without warning. One second I'm fine standing in line at the store the next I wanna push everyone out of my way and take off running.

I wanted to get some advice/thoughts on my predicament. I have two dogs: a husky who is 9.5 years and a Shiba Inu who is 4.5 months. 

I have generalized anxiety, and usually I can work myself out of a cycle (e.g., mind racing, same thoughts over and over, etc.). My husband and I are leaving to go on vacation for the first time since we got the puppy. We don't have a lot of money, so we can't afford a nice home sitter or a fancy doggy day care. We have a boarder who we can afford, but I can tell it isn't the best for my older dog. I'm worried that it's going to be an issue for my younger dog too. 

I know they're a business and they have taken care of my older dog fine (he just has separation anxiety himself). How can I get these worries out of my mind? I am boarding them tomorrow for the trip and I've been laying in bed for two hours trying to get my mind to stop racing. Does anyone have any advice for these cycling thoughts? 

I've thought of other boarding services but there's nothing else we can afford. The trip itself is paid for as a present to us. I tried to find something I could deem ""better"" in our budget to no avail.",0,2019-12-24 07:24:48 EST-0500

I tried to explain but she told me to go sit down. I get to sit there and feel the panic set in. The whole time I knew it was completely avoidable. I knew when to leave. They wouldn't let me. The worst part is my school has started doing monthly assemblies. I cant do them. I'm going to fall back into self harm. I got to sit there and feel myself go mental amd cry my eyes out on the bus ride home and I knew when to leave and I knew I could've prevented it all but I wasn't allowed to.

* acute anxiety meds (which I have never used from this kit, but you'll never know...)
* grapefruit essential oil and a couple swabs to put them on (don't worry, I'm not into oils *at all*. Some nurse at the hospital suggested that to calm me down once and it sort of stuck. It doesn't really do much, but I associate the smell with something positive).

I have made an appointment with my therapist just to touch base with her and ensure I am still on track. But overall, I feel much better. I even cooked a little bit today. I am grateful to therapy and am grateful to my friends who were a rock during this period. Also, to those redditors who offered some very kind words when I needed it.

167,Ever feel anxious that your anxiety is not real or that you‚Äôre not ‚Äúanxious enough?‚Äù,"I know I have anxiety, I‚Äôve been prescribed Xanax before, had a doctor tell me ‚Äúyou have anxiety,‚Äù and have almost every symptom including panic attacks. Yet I can‚Äôt help but feel that my anxiety is not valid, or that I don‚Äôt feel ‚Äúanxious‚Äù enough and I don‚Äôt deserve any help for it. 

Whenever I relax in the day, just reading or scrolling through my phone I can feel my stomach begin to twist and I begin to chide myself, ‚Äúhow can I be relaxed if I have an anxiety disorder?‚Äù I feel like I‚Äôm faking it, deluding myself, trying to piggy back off people with this disorder and garner some sympathy for myself. Then I get really anxious, my heart rate increases, sometimes I sweat, sometimes my thoughts get intrusive which makes me feel ‚Äúrelaxed,‚Äù because this is how I‚Äôm ‚Äúmeant to feel,‚Äù constantly drenched in fear because that gives me my ‚Äúedge‚Äù and that is ‚Äúexactly‚Äù how people with anxiety feel. (I know it‚Äôs not, it‚Äôs ridiculous, if I never relaxed I would‚Äôve suffered a heart attack by now and I love relaxing, feeling tension drain from my body, but hurrah if I relax too long I get anxious)

I also have a close friend with severe anxiety, far worse than mine and mine isn‚Äôt good, I feel ‚Äúinferior,‚Äù and ‚Äúunworthy‚Äù of help, because look at them, their anxiety is worse, they have more panic attacks, they have it so hard, my struggles are nothing compared to theirs. I bottle it up, pretend I‚Äôm okay, I feel ashamed talking about my feelings to them because who on Earth am I talk? I feel anxious? They‚Äôre probably having a panic attack talking to me and the thought just sends fear spiking through me because I‚Äôm scared of seeming weak or clingy and seeming selfish for admitting I struggle.

I don't know about you guys, but for me, my anxiety starts off small and then spirals without me noticing until I'm so deep in I don't know how to get out. The bathroom started off just messy, you know when life gets busy and you're like, I'll just get all that hair later. Until the drain clogs. And it's not so bad, clogged drain whatever.

You buy stuff to unclog the drain but the packaging sits in there for a week too long. Your hair is still just kind of collecting over everything. Empty bottles of hair product join the other stuff. And suddenly it's really a mess. And then you start to worry. This is going to take a long time to clean up. I won't have time for this! Why did I wait so long? 

It becomes a different kind of anxiety. Now I'm anxious about the anxiety that caused this. Fuck, now what? In my case, avoid at all costs. Dry shampoo, just a quick face wash, lots of laundry and body spray. Then you start showering at the gym to avoid it all together and shit hits the fan. I won't go into detail further, but it was gross. 

But you know what? I just fucking cleaned it. I deep cleaned the shit out of it. I cleaned the toilet, twice. I unclogged the drain. I got rid of every bottle, every old hair tie. I sprayed and rinsed the shower until the soap scum was gone. I changed the lightbulbs and scrubbed the sink and the vanity. I was shaky and sweaty but I did it and it's clean!

It's not perfect. I need to wash towels and go through the cabinets. But you know what, I'm not afraid to go back in there and shower tonight. That's fucking huge.

It stirred up anxiety about the way the rest of my house looks. I've got a lot of work ahead of me. But I accomplished something today. And that's not nothing.",35,2019-05-28 01:03:26 EDT-0400

My doctor thought I may have anemia or a thyroid problem. They‚Äôve tested for everything under the sun and there‚Äôs nothing wrong with me. I feel like a hypochondriac and the girl who cried wolf.

But it nothing is physically wrong, then the doctors and everyone around me concludes ‚Äúit‚Äôs all in my head‚Äù.

I don‚Äôt WANT anything wrong with me obviously. I panic at the thought of having any physical ailment. But I feel like, if it were a sinus issue or I was low on iron for example, it would be an easy fix and the problem would be alleviated.

200,'For as long as I remember... As far back as I can tell from my memory... There was no 'before'...'-group?,"((This is my first post ever on Reddit, so I hope I'm doing this right.))

TL;DR: Lifelong anxiety, how to handle, cope, fix or cure? Because I never found someone 'like me'. (Not being arrogant... Don't know how to say it otherwise...)

We all have this same goal; reduce the anxiety to a level at which it's manageable, right? Because really becoming fearless is highly unlikely (and I think not healthy.)
But we all have a different starting point. 
Some had a bad experience 6-7 months ago... 
Some had a trauma 6-7 years ago... 

But there's also a group of people who are suffering from their anxiety as long as they can remember. From 'birth'
I'm one of them, unfortunately. I'm diagnosed with a Generalized Anxiety Disorder with panic attacks which resulted in a deep depression on the side. Served on a plate of Avoidant Personality Disorder. 

People of 'my group', has anyone a working coping mechanism?
I'm just so tired.. 16 years of, different approached cognitive behavioural therapy based, talking.. 10-11 years of swallowing various medication options. 
26 years of exposure in vivo. 
Meditation, walking, exercising, etc. 
And nothing really changed. 

It's also hard to work when you don't have a memory you can fall back on. A memory of how life was without anxiety. Then you have some handles to hold onto. A goal of which you can calculate the distance. 
I just don't know what to expect of life. 
I find that very hard. 

Also I don't have parents to blame. No divorce, alcoholic dad, or emotional  numbed mom
My parents and family are full of love and understanding. And always helping me finding ways to achieve some small successes.
Only problem I see is being raised over-protective. But I find the punishment 'life long anxiety' out proportion. You know what I mean? (Also another thing I find hard to cope with. The guilt my parents feel about me suffering though life.)

For some context:
26 years old, living at home, studying anything and everything that interests me (music, electrical engineering, webdesign, graphic design, Sketchup, literature, health, etc), hardly ever go outside, holidays are awful. No experience in relationships, never had a girlfriend, never had sex, never kissed a girl. Miraculously finished high school. Unemployed - Not searching.  And luckily I got a few good friends left who are empathic and occasionally help me with my exposure objectives. ('Mission 1: get outside'). 
And many more things I can tell, but...

How do you hold on? What technique or therapy really helped you? Or if it's possible, how did you get better? From a life long state of anxiety to a manageable dose.   

Can someone help me out with info? 
Thanks in advance!",4,2019-02-01 03:24:01 EST-0500

203,Anxiety Getting Worse - Need Advice,"Hello, 

I have been experiencing more anxiety lately within the past month or so, than usual. I am an introvert and highly sensitive person, so I usually have some level of anxiety, but now it feels much worse suddenly. I keep having constant unwanted thoughts about my past negative experiences with men (allowing people to take advantage of me, not respecting myself, random hook-ups that I regret) out of the blue, which I am constantly fighting against in my head, making me feel exhausted. I have also noticed that I am just more anxious about everything in general, especially in social situations (I am shy and introverted already, so it just feels amplified now). 

I also feel like I might be experiencing some depression too. I have had a low mood, lack of interest in my usual hobbies and passions, lack of motivation to exercise and do anything, negative self-esteem and low confidence and overall feelings of sadness and wanting to cry randomly. 

I don't know what's going on with my brain but this anxiety and possible depression is making me even more anxious. 

I have visited my naturopath who prescribed me Vitamin B, Vitamin D, Magnesium, Omega 3s and a herbal treatment with St. John's Wort, Passionflower and Valerian. I have been taking the vitamins consistently for months, but just started the herbal treatment a few days ago and haven't noticed a difference yet. 

I have an appointment set up with my doctor and a therapist early next week. Nothing has really changed in my life recently, except from being in a stressful and overwhelming job, which I started last summer. I have noticed that I have been feeling more stressed since then.

215,"I'm powerless, I'm suffering.","A little over a week ago, perhaps 2 weeks ago now my wife got sick in the middle of the night which woke me up. Shortly after I myself started feeling sick so I went downstairs and convinced myself that I was just in my own head. My heart was beating a million beats per second, I was sweating, shaking, and nauseous. After convincing myself I was just being silly I finally calmed down but this took hours and hours of standing in my kitchen trying to calm down. By the time I finally felt comfortable enough to fall asleep it was about 5am and I had to call in to work because I needed to be at work at 8.   


I woke up at about 9 and got very little sleep, I spent that day taking care of my wife trying to make her feel better. I didn't have an appetite the whole day and outside of feeling a bit sleepy I actually felt fine. That night before bed the very same symptoms washed over me and I spent the whole night standing in the kitchen again trying to calm myself down once more. Heart racing, shaking, nauseous, tired. I went to bed around 5am again and again called in sick to work.   


My wife was at this time fully recovered, I hadn't told her what was going on as I didn't want her to worry/think I am weird. When she came down that morning at about 9am to see why I was asleep on the couch I told her I had really bad insomnia and had fallen asleep down there. That night while I felt very nervous about having this happen again I was so tired from lack of sleep that I finally fell asleep at about 9 but I woke up early that morning at about 4am and had to run to the bathroom with horrible diarrhea. After that was done I got worried again and started shaking, I felt like the walls of the house were closing in on me and felt like if I didn't leave the house I was going to be ill. So I went to work very early and told my boss I was just trying to catch up on work that I was behind on from calling in. I lied to my wife and told her that I got an on-call and needed to go in early. (again the thought of her worried about me makes me anxious). I got into my office and much like I would in the kitchen I sat in my office and calmed myself down then felt completely fine. 

&#x200B;

That night rolled around and I started having those extreme feelings of dread wash over me like I was becoming ill again. I had to tell my wife at this point what was going on, so I told her that I just needed to get out of the house for a minute, so I went to Walgreens panicking the whole way there but as soon as I got there I started to feel completely normal. Once I got there I was hoping to buy zzzquil but ended up getting NyQuil to basically force myself to sleep. I took it and fell asleep woke up the next morning feeling GREAT that I had finally gotten a nights sleep.  


Every single day now for going on over a week, I spend the whole day feeling completely fine. As soon as I get home I feel twinges of anxiety but I tell myself if I just take my mind off it I'll be fine so I read and watch TV. Sometimes I'm okay until about 7pm then the very same horrible feelings wash over me, I leave the house and go stand in my office in the middle of the night until I'm calm, then go home drink some NyQuil and go to sleep. Sometimes I'm fine until even later, I wake up at like 2am and start panicking then have to leave the house to calm down at my office some more before going back.  


My wife has been going through a very hard time emotionally with the loss of our pregnancy and being depressed because of work. I want to be able to be there for her, but I spend all night at the office trying to calm down. We went on a date yesterday in hopes that getting out of the house would make me okay and she could tell I was miserable the whole time. This anxiety, wherever it has come from is completely controlling my life. I don't know what to do, I don't know where to look. I'm becoming extremely depressed because I miss my wife, I just want to be able to be home with her in her time of need. The more depressed I get the more anxiety I feel.   


I am completely lost, I've never in my life suffered anxiety.",2,2019-02-01 08:10:10 EST-0500

218,I always feel like I'm going to die soon.,"Hi everyone! I hope my post finds you all well. I was hoping to vent a bit here and maybe get some advice. 

I've been suffering from really terrible anxiety and what started as overwhelming fear of home invasions moved into health anxiety and hypochondria. Anything that I feel physically I immediately make into a fake illness. If I have a stomach ache it's probably a rare illness from those leftovers I had yesterday, if my head hurts it's a tumor, etc. 

It's been putting a strain on my life and I don't know how to make it better. Any advice is welcome! ",2,2019-02-01 04:50:51 EST-0500
219,Should I go to the doctor for my heart issues or not?,[deleted],2,2019-02-01 01:30:46 EST-0500
220,Hospital system just assign me with cute psychiatrist which almost paralyze me.,"I always have problem to act appropriately with women stranger since I broke up with my ex. By appropriate. I mean finding something to talk and thinking straight. I always tell myself that I shouldn‚Äôt talk about my ex to any women if she doesn‚Äôt ask about it.

Most of the times my psychiatrist is always mens or middle aged lady.

This time, I don‚Äôt know how and why hospital just assign me with cute young doctor around my age she wear glasses and have resemble with my ex.

The moment I saw her I say with my self ‚ÄúOH CRAP, RED ALERT HOW CAN I TELL HER ABOUT MY SYMPTOMS‚Äù 
‚ÄúYOU NEED TO TELL HER ABOUT YOUR RECENT DEVELOPMENT AND HOW YOU STILL MISS YOUR EX SO SHE CAN FIND A WAY TO TREAT YOU‚Äù

I feel like I can‚Äôt talk about my ex in front of her but you need to fake it.

So I talk about my anxiety on my job finding stagnation while my mind scream ‚ÄúTALK ABOUT YOUR EX, SHE IS HERE TO TREAT YOU, TELL HER.‚Äù

I notice that my talking speed start to slow down. I find that I keep avoid her eye contact and my mouth hardly move.

Then I tell har about my ex but I find it hard to express aspects that psychiatrist need to know because I feel somewhat attract to her.

Then she ask me ‚Äúso, are you still looking for girlfriend ?‚Äù This question almost break me down. My Id tell that she is flirting with me while my superego tell me she is doing what she supposed to do and also wall of psychiatrist ethics bar her from dating me if she really wish so.

If she really want to date me and really date me it would be nice. but having her as my psychiatrist is making me really uncomfortable and kinda hinder my treatment.

So far I haven‚Äôt told my hospital to avoid incident like this, it‚Äôs really not her fault too. I want to express this.

Thing is nurse office and department administration is right in front of her office I can‚Äôt really tell all the nurse that I find this uncomfortable.

I wish I can tell someone or even her that I find her attractive and make me uncomfortable.

So thank r/anxiety to let me use this space. Thank you

222,First job interview in years tomorrow & I‚Äôm kinda nervous,"So I (19F) have only had two different fast food jobs back a few years ago when I was in high school. I only stayed at both jobs for a couple of weeks because of my social anxiety & I felt really incompetent. I haven‚Äôt been working the past few years because of lack of confidence. I‚Äôve applied at several jobs & even scheduled interviews for some, but always ended up being too anxious and never show up

But tomorrow morning I have an interview at a dog boarding facility! The job will pretty much be me taking care of the dogs & playing with them. Not too much interaction with humans besides co-workers which to me is a great thing. Even thought I‚Äôm feeling nervous I know I have to show up because a job this good doesn‚Äôt come along often. I can‚Äôt pass it up. 

I‚Äôm mainly feeling nervous about coming off as too awkward or if I say the wrong thing or smothering. I keep overthinking about little things like what do I say when I walk in? 

Overall I know this will be a good thing for me because I‚Äôm 19 & I‚Äôm going to have to get a job at some point. Plus it will be nice to be able to start to save money & be more independent but idk I just hope it all goes well! ",2,2019-02-01 01:04:08 EST-0500
223,DAE struggle with not believing you have anxiety?,"So, I've posted here before but I was wondering how anyone else might handle this.

I have an anxiety disorder but I've gotten better at managing it, learning triggers, and basically just talking it out with my mom, grandmother, and boyfriend. But it's still an every day battle, even right now I'm having mild anxiety about if I washed my hands enough today to avoid getting norovirus. 

Sometimes I get the feeling that this is all in my head. That maybe, even though I've been diagnosed and taken medication and everything, that maybe this isn't real. This can't be real, I can't be this afraid of nothing. I can't be afraid to leave my house, I can't be afraid of just freaking existing. The triggers I have can't really be real. I can't be so afraid of my own body that some days I cringe when I'm about to be touched.

No matter how many times it turns out to be nothing, I can't help but think it's not going to be nothing this time.  I feel like this fear is a thousand times worse than the pain itself.  I would take pain that is a couple times worse than the pain I get if it would mean I never have to feel anxiety.  It's to a point.

243,Say what you will Benzodiazepines are sometimes a must. Do NOT be afraid of taking medicine.,"I've been suffering from on & off anxiety disorder for some 7 years now, and although I know that what hits me is anxiety. I keep feeling the sensations, I keep losing my appetite, and I feel absolutely zoned out. No matter how much positive talk you try to pamper yourself with - which btw I no longer believe is a way to deal with anxiety - it just simply doesn't work. 

Sometimes people with anxiety get extremely overwhelmed to function. While that is happening they are also thinking about their responsibilities towards their wife, incoming baby, house, and work. Even when I try to act that everything is normal infront of my wife, this shit wont pass her by. Thank goodness she's the best human being on this universe and I consider myself the luckiest person in this world for having her.

I know some people are against medicine but to be honest sometimes. You. Just. Have. To. 

No matter what other people say. Do not stop yourself from trying to live properly. Because no matter what other people say, they don't feel what you're feeling. If you need medicine, to calm your anxiety down and you've tried ""solving"" it the normal ways but didn't work. Do not hold yourself back. Forget about all this chemical imbalance stuff.

256,I have crippling anxiety over going to work and it‚Äôs causing me to have trouble holding a job down.,"I just graduated from college this summer and started looking for full time work starting a few months ago. I have never worked full time for more than a few months due to going away to school and during school would never work more than a part-time job. This is when my work anxiety started I think. I had two jobs since September that I have quit because it gave me too much anxiety to go to work. 

Given the jobs where customer service jobs and had high stress atmospheres at times. But I have always worked in retail and it has never bothered me until recently. 

Now one job number 3 in since September. If I am scheduled an 8 hour shift or more, I get so anxious about it that I lose sleep over it the night before and feel physically Ill before I go to work. Sometimes it gets better once I get to work other times it causes me to call off or leave early. I will have anxiety over stupid irrational things that I know are no big deal or that won‚Äôt happen (I.e. making mistakes, being yelled by boss or customers, or being too busy). Even though I know I can handle these things it still causes me so much stress. I‚Äôm afraid that it‚Äôs not the jobs I‚Äôm picking that are causing me anxiety, but it‚Äôs me at this point. I fear that my anxiety will cause me to lose another job and I will have trouble keeping a job or be miserable for the rest of my life. 

Reddit has always been a kind community that has given me solid advice in the past. I am wondering if anyone has had the same problem or has any helpful advice I could try. Thanks for reading.",12,2019-11-25 19:34:52 EST-0500

By the¬†age¬†of 30, that¬†was¬†19¬†years¬†ago, all the¬†hidden¬†angst popped up - three¬†factors¬†where the¬†cause, that simple.¬†Stressful¬†job, extra-occupational study,¬†new¬†partner.

What then followed were nervous breakdowns, depression, personality disorder, anxiety, panic attacks and phobias.¬†A¬†heave¬†of psychological and physiological symptoms¬†flushed¬†over me.¬†It made a formerly strong and independent woman weak.¬†Gone¬†were¬†self-esteem¬†‚Äì¬†I¬†felt¬†worthless,¬†I¬†was¬†worthless.

I¬†could not work as hard and good as¬†I¬†used to.¬†Problems¬†with¬†short¬†and long-term memory,¬†concentration¬†‚Äì¬†no longer¬†was¬†I¬†the ambitious¬†young¬†woman.¬†Perfectionism¬†robbed¬†me of¬†energy.

All of this¬†made¬†my world stop in¬†motion.¬†And my¬†world¬†became¬†smaller¬†and¬†smaller¬†over these¬†years¬†‚Äì¬†until¬†my¬†life¬†took place only in my own four walls.¬†Not necessary to¬†write¬†that the¬†fears¬†increased by the avoidance behavior.¬†I¬†had¬†the¬†urge¬†to¬†control¬†every single body¬†symptoms¬†and all around me ‚Äì¬†even the¬†people¬†that are near¬†to me.¬†I¬†wanted¬†to¬†master, to¬†dominate¬†every¬†move.¬†And it¬†cost¬†me all of my¬†energy.¬†Energy¬†that¬†I¬†desperately¬†needed¬†to get¬†forward, to move¬†forward, to¬†challenge¬†myself.

In the¬†last¬†two¬†decades¬†I¬†learned¬†‚Äì in a felt zillion ‚Äì¬†therapies, what could¬†help¬†me to¬†get¬†through¬†the¬†rough¬†times.¬†I¬†know¬†more¬†than my¬†therapists, now¬†I¬†admit.¬†But for what use?¬†So¬†in¬†theory¬†I¬†got¬†an A, but when it¬†comes¬†to¬†commitments¬†and challenges¬†I¬†fail.

Oh, there¬†were¬†times¬†when¬†I¬†went by car on¬†my¬†own and just head off, took long strolls all by¬†my¬†self, even got on the¬†airplane¬†several¬†times¬†to¬†land¬†in the most¬†beautiful¬†places and traveled around.¬†But these¬†times¬†were¬†very¬†rare.¬†Still,¬†those¬†magnificent adventures are preserved deep in¬†my¬†brain.¬†Now and then¬†I¬†open¬†up one of these¬†drawers¬†and¬†watch¬†at¬†those¬†memories¬†in aww ‚Äì¬†sometimes with a¬†smile¬†other¬†times¬†with¬†tears¬†of¬†grief¬†and¬†frustration¬†that¬†I¬†probably will never be¬†able¬†to¬†experience¬†those¬†kind¬†of¬†moments.

My boyfriend told me that I should try to go because this was something I needed to do since I already got paid for the item. Sometimes all you need is some support from one person to tell you that you‚Äôll be fine about a certain situation

Once I got back I felt so relieved, it was something so easy to do and I was just overthinking it and making myself more anxious but in reality there was nothing to be anxious about!

Her appointment was moved from with a doctor to an advance nurse who I explained could also deal with the issue she was having. She slowly got very angry and I ended up crying sat at the desk after she left (missing her appointment). I had to call my coworker down and sat in the toilet for like 10 minutes then 20 minutes with my boss trying to catch my breath. All in all took me over 50 minutes to breath normally again.

I've always had anxiety but never had a panic attack. I've never had a panic attack before, I think it's as I started Citalopram last week. They're only 10mg so I'm surprised at how much its effected me.

Unfortunately, I can't seem to apply that on myself. I have been struggling with anxiety and depression for 8 years and it's been a roller-coaster, with way more downs than ups. From time to time I will feel a bit more in control, but eventually I always relapse, and the panic and depression are back.

I always think of myself as the weirdest, most problematic, and complex person ever. A lost cause really. I have like infinite mental problems and I'm ashamed of it. I find it ridiculous that, besides still not being able to control anxiety and depression after so much time and experience, sometimes I stop my life because of dizzy spells and because my tinnitus gets worse, and when that happens I can never fall asleep, and I worry that I'll be dizzy for the rest of my life, that I'll never hear silence again, that I'll never sleep again and I'll die. That I'll never have a normal life. 

Plus, no one's really familiar with some of the things I mentioned, so they'd think I'm a freak.

I've had the worst anxiety in my life for over a month and now that it finally calmed down a little bit when I think about stuff I'll talk to the therapist about it gives me anxiety again. 

Also I feel like I will set my expectations way to high and I'll be really dissapoined when it won't be as helpful as I hoped. 

Basicly I have anxiety about treating my anxiety and it sucks.

298,"I got 'Oinked' at in the subway, and now I can't bare the thought of going outside again.","Okay look, I'm a bit overweight. No getting away from that. But I carry it fairly well, and my overall physical appearance has not altogether bothered me *too* much until now. But after months and months of barely being able to leave my house, I put on some good clothes today, and decided I was ready to go and do something useful. Actually it was to go and view a new apartment, because I've been thinking I need to get out of my comfort zone - new apartment, new life, right? Well, maybe. But as I was coming out of the ticket booths on the train some guy literally oinked in my face. He leaned across from me in the turnstiles and properly pig-oinked. I didn't actually notice  it was towards me at first, but once we'd buzzed through he looked back at me and oinked again three times. It was the middle of the day, there was absolutely no reason for it, but it just.. it absolutely floored me. Maybe I'm worse than I thought? Maybe it was a huge mistake even leaving my house in the first place? Jesus, I just wanted to turn right around and go home.

I managed to make it to the house viewing, and I liked the apartment, and I may well take it, but this is all I can think about. I want to sink into the floor. I want to utterly disappear. Of all the things that I disliked about myself, of all the issues I have had with myself, my exterior has been 'okay'. But even that's gone, now. I need to just get over this, right?

338,MY ANXIETY AND DEPRESSION HAS MADE ME MISS A MONTH AND A HALF OF COLLEGE,"English isn't my first language so if its a bit bad i'm sorry

A little backstory i moved from Asia to Europe for my college degree(comp.sci) , i have never really lived alone and I've always had people i know around me and never felt alone before, I don't really have anyone to talk to or get closure so i thought i might as well post here and get some advice and maybe how knows i might even feel a bit better

As i said i moved from Asia to Europe I've been here for nearly a year (still a first year) and my first semester was a decent semester i got good grades 8/10s in most of my classes except for calculus which i failed even though i tried my best (not really good at math) i guess that's when it happened i had my first real panic attack mind you i have failed in classes many times in high-school failing wasn't the issue facing my parents was, for nearly a week i didn't attend any calls from my mom or my dad or my sister, they were really upset obviously i lied to them and that i was on a trip with friends and i haven't used my phone because i was having ""fun"" with my friends and i dodged the question for a couple more days and eventually told them and clearly they were upset but was understanding they knew that was pretty bad in math they told me it was alright and told me to do better when i retake the class i felt a bit better i guess, but that was just the starting of the problems i started to have like a pit in my stomach even if i  just wanted to go outside to get food or do anything normal i felt like this for nearly a month but i still was stubborn about it and the second semester started, the nail in the coffin for my anxiety to just go out of control i was just about to go to enter my class when i heard the supposed people i called my friends were talking about me they were calling all kinds of bad things talking about how ugly i looked (i already had issues with how i looked because i was bullied about how i looked through out middle school right untill i finished highschool so that really hit me hard) and how they were trying to get rid of me but i was bit clingy, i just froze i didn't know what to do they hadn't seen me so i just turned back and just bolted home trying not to cry and just shut myself off from everything i couldn't even sleep without crying i couldn't even try to go to class just the thought of it makes me feel like i want to die

And that leaves me here right now i can't even talk to my parents or my sister and i'm really down right now and i don't really know what to do coupled with the fact that i have missed almost every test and assignment given untill now i'm most likely gonna get fucked by the end of the semester so yeah i just wanna get this off my chest so i can feel a bit better i guess

353,Fear of tiny things ruining a friendship,"Does anyone else ever get anxiety over worrying avout tiny things causing friends to leave you?

I often, with friends I really care about, start worrying that something minor I said, like a joke I interpreted as harmless or something inocuous that I can't be sure how they interpret it, will create this huge crack in our friendship. Even with people who've said that I'm their best friend and they appreciate having me in their life so much, I still worry to no end. ""Did they get an impression that is not accurate to what I meant and me trying to explain myself only causes distrust?"" ""Did I step over a line all of a sudden and they will remember this forever?""

It has ruined friendships as I often resort to seeking validation over and over when this happens, and I am hellbent on not doing it again, but how do I maintain my calm when all my brain wants to do is jump to conclusions about how I will be abandoned or that I've crossed a line I didn't mean to and caused permanent damage on our relationship?

I'm trying to remind myself that the friends I've chosen are reasonable people and won't get distraught over small stuff when they know I often put my foot in my mouth, and that a close friendship doesn't break over a day. Yet I still have this constant pit in my stomache.

356,Just made my first ever counseling appointment...,"The first time a doctor suggested I talk to a counselor was my second year of college. She also prescribed an antidepressant, which I took, but I never went to a counselling. The meds didn't make me feel happy, but they made me feel nothing, which at the time, was better than overwhelming sadness. Eventually things in my life changed/settled down and I felt better and was able to stop taking the meds and feel good without them.   


The last few years a lot has happened in my life that has been and continues to be very difficult to deal with. I have seen doctors a few times for anxiety and depression, tried antidepressants again and hated them, but never could get myself to schedule that counselor. I don't know why. If someone else had set me an appointment, I would have gone and probably been better for it, but for some reason, I just couldn't make myself do it or ask for the specific help I needed.   


Well today, I had to leave my day job early because the stress has really been weighing on me, and it is catching up with me physically in various ways. When I got home, I took out the business card I've been carrying around for a couple of months and sent in a request for a new patient appointment online. I got a call back later and let it go to voicemail. My first instinct was to wait until tomorrow to call back, but I pushed through and made the call.  


My appointment isn't for three weeks, but I am hopeful that it will help. The circumstances that cause the most stress in my life are not going to change anytime soon, but the attempts I've made to manage my stress and anxiety on my own are clearly not enough. I don't know what I'm looking for by sharing this; I just wanted to tell someone. Encouragement is appreciated, and if you have advice for someone who has never been to counseling, that is also welcome.

367,Physical Anxiety,"I have had anxiety all my life, but in 2013 I was finally diagnosed. I was in a really bad rough patch with my mental health, and I had all the basic emotional symptoms of anxiety; feelings of doom, crying, worrying, nightmares, attacks ect.   


Over the years it has gotten so much better, but this past year I notice my anxiety is coming back, but this time it's not actively emotional. I'm still nervous, and emotional, and kinda OCD about some things. But the worst thing that is happening, is that my body has all these fun new physical symptoms. I know you should never google a symptom, but all the one's I do always lead back to anxiety.   


I was wondering if anyone else gets weird physical symptoms too and how they deal with it?

For example, when I go to bed and lie down in my nice duvet, for the first hour it feels like my skin on fire, it itches and burns. It doesn't matter what I'm wearing, if I did, or did not shower, or if I have cream on. I also get headaches about every 3 weeks that last for days, they are throbbing and right at my temples and it makes me so frustrated because I can't seem to treat or prevent them. Another symptom, and the worst, is the butterflies. It's like my tummy is always tying itself in knots. Butterflies as soon a wake up, and when I go to bed, and all day. Of course they get worse when I am actually stressed, but the butterflies are always there. They can prevent me from eating, or sleeping, and sometimes they become so bad they cause bathroom issues. 

&#x200B;

TLDR. Why did my anxiety turn from purely emotional thing to having only the physical symptoms? ",2,2019-01-24 06:19:36 EST-0500
368,I‚Äôm a 17 year old that recently got into a new relationship and I need help with overthinking.,My mind won‚Äôt let me be happy and keeps bringing up thoughts that I can‚Äôt stop. I recently have started to go to therapy but I was wondering how medication works and if it helps. ,4,2019-01-24 02:16:31 EST-0500
369,Crippling anxiety in class and other places where I can‚Äôt leave,"For the past few weeks, I have been having horrible panic attacks/anxiety episodes. I feel like I can‚Äôt breathe, my throat closes up and I get super hot and sweaty. The worst part is I feel super nauseous, and that these always tend to happen in situations where I can‚Äôt really leave easily like my college classes. As a result, a lot of the advice on here like lay down, listen to music or do something else to distract you don‚Äôt work for me because I‚Äôm in the middle of class, or the middle of a movie theater. It‚Äôs happened twice in this class where I just have to get up after about 30 minutes and miss the majority of the class to run out of the room. It‚Äôs an auditorium style lecture hall so I can‚Äôt quietly go out the back, everyone sees me leave to go to the bathroom to try to calm down, to ultimately needing to leave again because I panic again after trying to calm down in the bathroom. It happened to me in another class where I gave a presentation. During this ‚Äúpresentation‚Äù I didn‚Äôt even have to say a word, just stand there for 10 minutes while two other members spoke. I have done so many presentations before where I have had to speak, and although it‚Äôs not my favorite thing, I‚Äôve never had a reaction like this. It was the longest ten minutes just standing up there feeling like I was going to throw up, like I just NEEDED to run out of there. I stood my ground but as soon as my group finished I left to go to the bathroom to calm down. Watched another group present, feeling anxious the entire time still. When they were done I left for the bathroom again, only to force myself to return. It‚Äôs my last semester of college, my classes are important and interesting to me and I don‚Äôt want to miss them. I‚Äôm dealing with a lot of stress lately with job searching, relationship issues and just general depression for negative self image and fear for the future. I have been seeing a counselor at my university for the past few months and although I‚Äôve been anxious before I‚Äôve never had so many attacks like this, almost every other day. They happen in the worst times, never when I‚Äôm just home alone or not doing anything. I don‚Äôt know what to do. As soon as I leave the class, the panicked feeling is pretty much gone, but I cannot keep running out of my classes and I don‚Äôt want to get so afraid of anxiety that I stop going altogether.",1,2019-01-22 22:28:43 EST-0500
370,Not sure how to handle this,"I'm uncomfortable in my own skin ugh. I'm low key freaking out in my mind when I talk to people I'm not close with. My voice lacks confidence and maturity in these situations and I hate the sound of it. Basically just want to completely avoid these situations and hide.

But when I‚Äôm with people I‚Äôm comfortable around, I‚Äôll be super outgoing and feel fine.",0,2019-01-24 21:32:23 EST-0500

383,To my friends who suffer from anxiety in silence,"Some days at work are great, and others.. not so much. I got my first job earlier this year, after years of dreading it. Here I am now, well liked at work by nearly everyone, making decent money (considering what I do), and financially helping my family. 

Despite everything generally being great, I still have days where I can‚Äôt help but take a few minutes to cry in the bathroom at work. I think I hide it pretty well, and I don‚Äôt think anyone at work knows what I mess I am sometimes. I don‚Äôt ever talk to anyone about my anxiety in depth, and there are likely a lot of people here who suffer in silence too. 

If anyone is reading this at work right now, maybe in the bathroom trying to pull yourself together (or anywhere really), I believe in you and I‚Äôm rooting for you! This community is so kind and supportive. I truly believe we are all so brave and courageous and I just wanted to send out a nice message to anyone who may need to hear it from someone but doesn‚Äôt have anyone in their life to talk to about their anxiety. 

Whether you‚Äôre overcoming a fear of talking to the cashier at the grocery store, or you‚Äôre scared to talk on the phone, or to leave your house, or maybe you‚Äôre like me and you‚Äôre just constantly shaky and worried for seemingly no reason but try to hold your head up high and carry on, I am so proud of you. Celebrate every little accomplishment and step you take. Because anxiety is so ugly and can be so debilitating, every little piece of success should be celebrated. 

I‚Äôm always here to chat if anyone needs a friend. I love this community so much. oo",39,2019-08-05 00:12:19 EDT-0400
384,Never make assumptions about what others think about you. You may eventually perpetuate that into a fact.,"I have been going to therapy for my anxiety and I thought I would pass some knowledge along. I never even realized I was doing this until I talked to my therapist. In random social situations, I would always assume that others had it out for me. Example, someone does not wave back. My assumption is that I am not likable, that I‚Äôm ugly, or people don‚Äôt care about me. Think about the messages you are perpetuating to yourself on a daily basis. You could be telling yourself hundreds of times a day all these negative assumptions. No wonder we get anxious. Maybe they didn‚Äôt wave back because they didn‚Äôt see you, or they are not social, maybe they just got told some bad news... etc. Stop jumping to a negative cycle of thinking or eventually you will really start believing these bogus ideas you have been telling yourself.",33,2019-08-04 00:01:06 EDT-0400

Hello everyone! Didn't expect it would have so many upvotes and comments- thank you my fellow Redditors!

**I want to share the story and maybe point out some of the useful tips on how to handle/ help with a panic attack, things that I learned from my cognitive-behavioral therapies and meditation:**

The background of the story: My friend was having a random panic attack for no apparent reason ^(Sometimes) ^(it) ^(happens) ^(to) ^(the) ^(best) ^(of) ^(us:),) she was crying and shaking, couldn't breathe properly, while the other friend who was with her didn't know what to do at all, not to blame them though.

First, you could start by giving them a hug (^(Obviously) ^(only) ^(if) ^(you) ^(know) ^(them) ^(personally,) ^(don't) ^(want) ^(to) ^(make) ^(people) ^(feel) ^(uncomfortable),) take them to a quiet room or indoor space (^(if) ^(you) ^(are) ^(outside,) ^(noises) ^(on) ^(the) ^(street) ^(may) ^(increase) ^(anxiety) ^(level).) In my case, we were indoor already. I then told her that she was in a safe place and I wasn't leaving until she feels better. You could also ask them what is going on/ how are you feeling? She then said to me *""I can't breath""*. So I held her hands and ask her to do some breathing exercises with me. **Start by taking a nice and deep breath, breath in from your nose for 4 seconds, then hold for 1, and exhale from your mouth for 4 seconds, and repeat.** You could either breath in and out with them, or you could count the numbers for them as a guide.

You will be surprised how much this technique would help when a panic attack occurs! While she was doing the breathing exercise, I was still holding her hands and telling her *""You are in control, you are safe, we are all here with you. Panic attacks are uncomfortable, but it's not dangerous""* etc. She was much much calmer after the breathing exercise, at this point, what I did was to talk to her to create some ""distractions"" from her and her anxiety, I find this very helpful personally when I am anxious. **Basically, you are turning your attention outward, and not to focus on yourself or the inner feeling/ physical sensations.** You could ask them simple questions like *""What did you do today?"" ""Where did you go for dinner?""* or even make some jokes along the way. Some people mentioned this technique too in the comments from the last post:

&#x200B;

* u/rogertaylorkillme: ^(What helps me is to ground myself. I try to focus on my surroundings. Things I can see, touch, hear, smell. There‚Äôs a certain way people do it but generally these things can help you realize you‚Äôre okay, life is going on.)
* u/Square-cactus: ^(Yes, this! Something similar is to do the ‚Äò5‚Äô trick. So find 5 things you hear, 4 things you can touch, 3 things you smell, 2 things you can see and 1 thing you can taste (or some combination of this)
* u/BiniTheMighty: ^(This helps for me to. Or find 5 red things, 4 blue, 3 green, 2 yellow, 1 purple. Or counting. Can be anything, like counting squars on my cup or number of red things on a shelf, or whatever. It helps to ground, regain focus on the real world.)

&#x200B;

Lastly, I want to share a podcast called [""The Anxiety Coaches Podcast""](https://podcasts.apple.com/ie/podcast/the-anxiety-coaches-podcast/id908153168) it has helped me so much! Please check them out if you are interested in learning more about anxiety and how to make peace with it;

Also [""Anxiety Slayer‚Ñ¢ with Shann and Anang""](https://podcasts.apple.com/gb/podcast/anxiety-slayer-with-shann-and-ananga/id348096293) They have one episode called ""How to stop an anxiety attack"" is very useful too. I have this one downloaded on my Spotify, just in case anything comes up you know.

[""Meditation for Anxiety""](https://www.headspace.com/meditation/anxiety) Again, please do meditations... I know, I know, enough with meditations, but they really helped me when I was struggling to get myself out of the house!

I hope this helps.

Take care, everybody! It's just a little turbulence.",45,2019-08-07 04:05:54 EDT-0400
386,The worst part about my anxiety is being tired all day but when I go to bed I just can't sleep,"I got to wake up in 4 hours at this point ill just go play on my computer.

388,I feel so bad for cancelling plans all the time,"I find myself needing to cancel plans a lot because my anxiety just gets bad and I'm just so overwhelmed with the situation. Often it's more formal things like meetings and stuff like that and it feels so much more difficult because I can just explain to my friends that I'm struggling with my anxiety, but if it's more formal it doesn't feel appropriate to tell them what's actually going on. I'm always afraid that people won't believe me when I say that I feel sick or talk about me behind my back and then I just feel even worse. Am I alone in this?",36,2019-08-06 16:22:05 EDT-0400

390,"‚ÄúWell, what are you anxious about?‚Äù","Does anyone else get somewhat annoyed at this question? I know that people who don‚Äôt deal with generalized anxiety as a disorder don‚Äôt fully understand it, but it rubs me the wrong way- especially when asked by someone multiple times after I‚Äôve explained myself.  Most of the time they can‚Äôt conceptualize it either. They don‚Äôt understand the fact that anxiety just exists without a cause for me sometimes. It‚Äôs like they think I need a looming stressful event or a trigger to cause it. Sure, those things will definitely exacerbate it, but sometimes it just manifests from nowhere. 

My answer is to this usually ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know,‚Äù because I literally have no clue most of the time. That‚Äôs kind of the whole point of GAD; that anxiety just exists within a person for either an irrational reason or no reason whatsoever. The fact that I‚Äôm restless, on edge, not feeling well, etc, without a catalyst seems alien to a lot of people. 

Have you guys found a good way to explain generalized anxiety to people who don‚Äôt understand it? It‚Äôs something I‚Äôm struggling with.",69,2019-08-06 18:38:40 EDT-0400
391,All of these shootings gives me anxiety about going out to public places.,"Even though I live in an area where shootings don't usually occur, I never know when there could be one. The shooting today in El Paso in a  Walmart happened and makes me more afraid of going to out public places. It's fucking disgusting that humans act this way.

396,Three years ago I feared leaving the house to walk my dog. Now just in the past two weeks I've flown to London and took a road-trip through France,"Even in the last six months, I never thought I would be able to get to the point where travel was a possibility again, but with a bit of hard work I've managed it. It certainly wasn't easy, but nothing worth doing is. Basically anything short of actively confronting my fears on a consistent basis would never have gotten me to this point. 

In the last year I've basically just went out of my way to do everything which scared me. I basically treated them like chores. 

Whilst this triumph is encouraging, it's also somewhat bittersweet, since I've basically had three (If not more) years of my life stolen away from me by anxiety. I've missed out on so many things that people take for granted. 

Saying that, I'm still happy that I'm moving forwards and not backwards. 

To everyone here, I hope this serves as some encouragement that this anxious mindset need not be permanent. Progress can be slow, but it will happen eventually.",15,2019-08-03 00:59:51 EDT-0400

400,"Does anyone else constantly feel like the ""pity friend"" and like everyone you know is closer to each other than to you?","This is one of the core issues of my social anxiety. I see the way everyone interacts and there are so many aspects of it that just do not come naturally to me because of how self-conscious I am and how much I try to stay out of everyone's way. People are way physically touchier with each other than they are with me (because being touchy just isn't something I naturally do in platonic relationships, even though I have no problem being touched), people tease each other a lot more and are way better at ~witty banter~ and being sassy with each other than I am and so people treat me weirdly more politely and delicately than they do other people, etc. which like the touching thing is I'm sure just because of how weirdly polite and overly nice I am and they don't want to overstep.

I just always notice that I am treated differently than most, almost like a child to some degree or at least someone who's pretty delicate and sensitive and naive (which I am to some degree, but I think I give off the impression that I am way more than is accurate). I just often end up feeling that I'm only invited to things out of pity more than anything and I somehow self-sabotage and put up boundaries that make it impossible for me to  be as close to others as they are to each other, or at least in the kinds of ways and dynamics with which people usually bond and connect.

I'm not sure how to put all of this into words really, but basically I'm just constantly overanalyzing everyone's behavior and they do treat me differently. They're very NICE, but that's mostly it and that's not really a basis for closeness and comfort with most people. I don't know how to fix it to be more approachable and make people feel more comfortable acting normal with me. I just always feel like I'm not ""in on"" things and just kind of there instead of actually an integral part of any groups. And I always feel like people look down on me and think I'm weird, stupid, oblivious, overly sensitive, childish, or a whole slew of other negative traits.",75,2019-05-05 23:56:53 EDT-0400
401,Does you anxiety ever make you feel like the people who love you the most actually think you're the worst person ever?,"All week I've been overthinking every interaction I have with the people I'm close to and overanalyzing any comments they might make.

402,Has anyone else been anxious since they were a kid?,"Ever since I was young, I've always been super anxious about everything. There's always been a whole host of things that made me anxious to the point where I'd avoid doing so much, even if I wanted to do whatever I was avoiding. I didn't even realise that it was a problem until I got into my teens and realised how much my anxiety stopped me from enjoying my life. 

From what I've read it seems like most people didn't always experience anxiety (correct me if I'm wrong), but as far back as I can remember I've always been that way. 

I'm just wondering if anyone else has always experienced some form of anxiety since they were very young as well.

Edit: Reading through all the replies, it seems that it's a lot more common than I was expecting. Main reason I was curious was because went to see someone about my anxiety problems, he seemed confused when I told him that I'd always remembered being anxious and it wasn't something that started happening when I was older.",183,2019-05-04 21:26:07 EDT-0400

404,If you are browsing and read this please take a moment and do this...," A moment to breathe. Take a minute and:
- stretch your back
- get your shoulders back
- unclench your jaw (important one - thank you u/SaltedBiscuitTV)
- relax your muscles and let your body feel its own weight
- wherever you are, imagine that your scenario is imaginary; you are alone and all noise or people are a sort of movie playing around you
- close your eyes (really, just do it)
- imagine you are in your safest place on earth (your bedroom, an island, near the sea...) -- you should do this as a sort of meditation technique, be careful with dissociation symptoms (I suffer from it but it helps to remove myself from the place I am so you do you!) - thanks to u/veraamber
- inhale deeply and hold it for a couple seconds
- exhale as slow as possible...
- repeat 5 or 10 times
- remember that right at this moment there are thousands of people feeling the same exact thing you are now feeling; you are NOT alone, think about it and feel that connection

Later:
- go on about your day and put the phone down when you can and if possible do something nice that calms you down later - you deserve it! Go for an icecream, snuggle in a nice blanket... 

- if you‚Äôre not alone let people know you need a break to feel better, it‚Äôs a great first step if you are ashamed of your anxiety or try to hide it

- when you have time, write down in a really small font size a list of things that make you feel calmer or relaxed (reading, music, whatever) - print it and put it in your wallet or anything you carry around because most of the time we just forget to do those things! 

When you feel overwhelmed, read the list and choose an item and DO it. It‚Äôs easy for us to fall in the trap of ‚Äúfreezing‚Äù and never do the things that we *know* calm us down. I have mine with a list of good things in life/things I enjoy doing/reminders that I‚Äôve struggled for years and... I‚Äôm still here!

Have a good morning/afternoon/night, you are NEVER alone <3

EDIT #1: added one more step thanks to u/SaltedBiscuitTV
EDIT #2: thanks to u/veraamber for the reminder on ""imagining you're elsewhere"" might be harmful to some people
EDIT #3: as I am still in a very agitated mood and my legs are sore from all the stress I just realized... first silver thingy on here x2! It feels amazing that venting while I was having a hard time helped someone out - Thank you! :') 
EDIT #4: Close your eyes after you read all of it ;)",47,2019-05-01 21:08:03 EDT-0400

406,Anyone else with anxiety have a crippling fear of confrontation?,"34 year old male, diagnosed with generalized and social anxiety.  

&#x200B;

I would actually say the worst symptom of anxiety for me is a fear of confrontation.  Even when I'm 100% in the right, having to call someone out on their bullshit can be enough to induce a panic attack.  

&#x200B;

Its only gotten worse with age.  When I was a little bit younger I""d push through the anxiety and make sure my voice was heard, I would say avoiding confrontation is a behavior I've learned over the years and now it's almost impossible for me to confront someone without stuttering and stammering through it, and that is if I even have the balls to confront someone in the first place.  

 

Then, I wind up even more pissed off and upset because I end up letting someone walk all over me and then my anxiety gets even worse, or I just shut down and get super depressed.  

&#x200B;

I just started therapy for my anxiety, am wondering if anyone with similar fears has had success through therapy and beating this type of anxiety",72,2019-05-02 13:08:10 EDT-0400

However, when I get back from work I find myself aimlessly scrolling through reddit or watching youtube videos. And my heart starts racing more as I become aware of how much time I just wasted. At that point, I feel so panicked that I can't do anything productive OR relaxing.

I think this is related to a fear that's often at the back of my mind - of aging and not doing anything important with my life. I place too much importance on developing new skills so then I'm scared of failure and am too anxious to do anything.

It's just that my symptoms and the things that cause me to be anxious coupled with the fact that my anxiety doesn't seem to be as severe as other people's causes me to feel unworthy and unheard. I've never had a panic attack before, and I know several people who with anxiety who have definitely had panic attacks and such. Mine has never gotten to that point. I kind of feel like I'm lost--I'm too anxious to function normally, but seemingly not anxious enough to feel like my anxiety is taken seriously by others.

487,I'm quitting my job this morning,"Everything has become too much and my panic disorder and health problems are making it impossible for me to work. I'm so scared of telling my boss. I'm so sick to my stomach, but I have to do this. I've been missing so much work and been so sick. I'm supposed to do this in about 45 minutes and I feel like my stomach is going to explode. Please send good vibes my way. This is not a choice I'm making lightly or without support or discussion, but it still doesnt make it any less difficult to give up my source of income, even if it's to improve my wellbeing.

Edit:

Update 1:
Thank you all for your support this morning. I quit my job and my boss who is normally evil was very understanding and actually acted like she sincerely cared about me getting better. I just wanted to elaborate a bit about what I've been going through. I've been having daily panic attacks for months now, some lasting for hours. I've been on several medications trying to find the right one, as well as going through having and treating gastritis and ibs. I also just had surgery to remove Endometriosis. I've been completely overwhelmed. This is not new to me, but the degree that it is disabling me is severe. I was diagnosed with panic disorder at age 11 and have gone through probably 2 or 3 other periods of time similar to this. Fortunately those were when I was younger and didn't have to work, so this is a new struggle for me. I've been seeing doctors and therapists this whole time but havent found an answer. One of my diagnosis by a licensed psychologist was ""treatment resistant anxiety"" which basically means that most people with my diagnosis respond more to typical treatments than I do. It also means I have to continue on my journey of finding the right treatment for me.

Update 2: I just went to my states local office for assistance and got approved for full state insurance benefits and $192.00 a month in snap benefits for food. I  broke down in tears in this womans office because even though this is going to be a struggle I will be able to get the medical care that I need and not worry about groceries. I will still need help from my family/boyfriend but at least not everything will be put on them.

Update 3: 8 months later and I've had very few panic attacks in MONTHS. I still deal with my anxiety issues but it's been so much better. You all helped me through this and I will forever be thankful. It was crazy to come back to this.",84,2019-04-24 16:27:01 EDT-0400

492,An Open Letter to the Overthinker,"Dear Overthinker, 

&#x200B;

Just take a deep breath in -- now breathe out. Did you feel that? That sense of relief and ease? It felt good, didn‚Äôt it? I know things get hectic sometimes, like you‚Äôre on a ship that is getting more and more crowded, and you can feel yourself slowly drowning.

&#x200B;

But you‚Äôre ship will **not** sink.

You‚Äôre too strong for that.

&#x200B;

I know it may feel as if you‚Äôre ship will give in, but our minds will not let it. As much stress and worrying overthinking causes us, where would we be without it? Just imagine if we didn‚Äôt overthink things -- we could be in big trouble. For an obvious reason we should always consider the consequences of our actions -- the world would be complete and utter chaos if we did things without thinking them through.

&#x200B;

Every second of everyday we are faced with decisions. And every single decision we make we are only one step away from living an entirely different life.

&#x200B;

Should we be afraid of that? No.

We should embrace it.

We should learn to love it.

&#x200B;

We are so incredibly lucky that one decision is all it takes to change the direction of your life -- we should never be unhappy with ourselves because we have control over everything we do. 

&#x200B;

But sadly, us overthinkers, fear that actualization. We spend most of our time worrying and stressing about the consequences of our actions that we never get to enjoy our choices.

&#x200B;

Don‚Äôt live in regret.

&#x200B;

Sincerely, 

Your fellow Overthinker",13,2019-04-26 05:30:58 EDT-0400

494,I‚Äôm going to the gym tomorrow for the first time in nearly a year - hold me accountable,"I‚Äôve not been in ages. I‚Äôve lost my main coping mechanism and along the way dealing with my anxiety and my bouts of depression have gotten worse. My husband really wants me to go back - not for my figure but because he notices the difference in my mental health when I go and he cares very much about me. 

I‚Äôve put weight on - which isn‚Äôt the main issue. But I‚Äôve been frightened to go back because of what my old personal trainer will think, what people at the gym will think of me. What if I embarrass myself? I don‚Äôt want to get naked in the changing rooms. I‚Äôm scared if someone will start a conversation with me. I‚Äôve been hiding on my sofa for over 9 months outside of work. Getting further stuck in an anxious rut. 

I want to go back tomorrow. I‚Äôm posting here to hold myself accountable and to get words of encouragement.",25,2019-04-22 17:36:22 EDT-0400
495,"I‚Äôm sorry for the long post, but I wanted to share my tips for how I manage my anxiety.","I‚Äôm 28 years old and I have 2 kids. In the past year I‚Äôve been diagnosed with Postpartum Anxiety, Postpartum OCD, GAD, and health anxiety. I‚Äôm an empath and highly sensitive person - I‚Äôve always had anxiety and depression (I mean since I was a teen), but that was nothing compared to now. The birth of my son brought on so much more anxiety and then with the birth of my daughter, it truly exploded. I started seeing my therapist in July 2018 after my GP recommended her. I started going every week, then every two weeks, then in February 2019 my therapist and I decided I can start going once a month! I wanted to share with everyone how I‚Äôve been dealing with my anxiety.

‚Ä¢ **Therapy.** Find a great therapist, or a doctor who will listen and help you find a great therapist. Please don‚Äôt be afraid to mention your struggles to someone, even if you‚Äôve been previously let down by another health professional. Trust me, I‚Äôve had my fair share of doctors who blatantly ignored my symptoms. Please keep trying.

‚Ä¢ **Journaling.** If you‚Äôre like me and you suck at journaling, I suggest checking Amazon for The Five Minute Journal. My therapist just recommended it to me. It has daily affirmations written in, weekly challenges, and the journal entries are done in the morning and at night so just keep it by your bed and you‚Äôre good to go.

‚Ä¢ **Watch something comforting.** For me, it‚Äôs Gilmore Girls and One Day at a Time.

‚Ä¢ **Boundaries.** Some of my anxiety stemmed from a lack of boundaries with my family and my therapist suggested that I read Stop Walking on Eggshells by Paul T Mason. It‚Äôs on Amazon and it has really helped.

‚Ä¢ **Music.** Make a playlist, blast the music, and sing! My favorite band is Say Anything. The frontman is extremely open about his anxiety (and about having bipolar disorder, too). This reflects in his music/song writing and I find it comforting.

‚Ä¢ **Eating healthy.** I changed my diet to a whole food plant based diet to get my health under control since I have health anxiety. I feel so much better!

‚Ä¢ **A community.** I read a lot of posts on this and other subs. I don‚Äôt really post a lot but just reading other people‚Äôs posts, especially on here, makes me feel less alone in my anxiety.

‚Ä¢ **A weighted blanket**. I try to get enough sleep, but most nights I just can‚Äôt. I have two young kids, so I usually get like 7 hours (that may sound like enough but, to be honest, I need like 10 hours to feel like I‚Äôm functioning normally). But my weighted blanket helps a lot. It doesn‚Äôt weigh much, only like 8 lbs but I just keep it on my upper body/arms and it helps me sleep well.

‚Ä¢ **Try to open up.** Some of my anxiety was from my husband and I having a disconnect because I shut people out. My therapist suggested The 5 Love Languages by Gary Chapman (also on Amazon). My husband and I both read it and highlighted what was important to us and realized we weren‚Äôt showing each other love in the ways we needed it. This probably saved our marriage.

‚Ä¢ **Take space when you need it.** I‚Äôm a stay at home mom, so by the end of the day I need a little bit of space. When my husband gets home, I put in my headphones and start cooking dinner by myself and he plays with the kids. I love cooking so much and it‚Äôs relaxing to me, as is music, so this really helps me unwind a bit.

‚Ä¢ **Other lifestyle changes.** I quit caffeine for a while and no longer drink wine (I really only drank socially, but now I‚Äôd rather not). Alcohol and caffeine were not good for my anxiety. I was drinking a lot of coffee so I needed to cut it out for a few months. Now I drink one cup a day.

‚Ä¢ **Self-help books.** The Worry Trick (on Amazon, surprise)! This book has been great for me and I even bought a copy and sent it to my sister. She‚Äôs gotten further into it than I have and she tells me it‚Äôs very helpful!

‚Ä¢ **The 90 Second Rule.** My therapist told me a while ago that our brains only feel emotions for 90 seconds at a time. If I feel bad for more than 90 seconds, it‚Äôs because I‚Äôm allowing myself to stay in that emotion. That has helped me so much. Now when something makes me anxious or angry or upset, I acknowledge it (sometimes in my head, sometimes aloud) and try to move on.

‚Ä¢ **Mindfulness Yoga.** Yoga with Adriene on YouTube has a yoga for anxiety video and it‚Äôs amazing, imo.

‚Ä¢ **Hobbies.** Aside from cooking, I genuinely enjoy cross stitching. I love it so much and it helps me keep my mind from racing. It allows me to have an outlet, which I truly needed after becoming a stay at home mom.

I‚Äôm sure a ton of people already do these things, but I just wanted to share what helps me. I hope this helps even 1 person feel a little bit better. I also want everyone to know that I do still struggle. Sometimes I forget about the 90 seconds or I don‚Äôt take space when I need it. I‚Äôm still learning to manage my anxiety, but I‚Äôm much better today than I was 9 months ago. I‚Äôm sorry for the long post!

My stomach always hurt.

For years I would vomit every morning (that only stopped last year and I'm about to be 28)

I was always in the nurses office in Elementary and I felt awful because they thought I was just bullshitting to get out of class. I was really miserable.

&#x200B;

In Highschool I was diagnosed with Anxiety, Depression, and IBS.

&#x200B;

Then I finally got a little bit of understanding from my parents but we never really talked about it.

&#x200B;

Some local kids have been taking their lives. It's upset the whole community. So we've all had a conversation being focused around mental health for the last few months.

&#x200B;

I saw a thread pop up on my FB newsfeed because my mother had commented on it.

&#x200B;

It was about anxiety and depression and how kids say ""my tummy hurts"" because they don't know why they feel sick.  


She was mentioning how she wished she knew I had anxiety when I was younger so that she could have eased my pain and worries back then instead of finding out 10 years later.  


I don't know, it was a relief to see that my mom does understand, and that she does care, and that she has remorse for not understanding me when I was little and vulnerable and afraid and confused. To know if she had a full understanding of why I was feeling the way that I was, that she would have done anything to change it for me. I just always thought my parents were burdened by me. Like there was something wrong with me, that shamed my parents. It was like this huge weight off my shoulders I didn't even know was there, to know that she does care, that she would have cared.

515,"im 13, and i have horrible anxiety. im seeing a movie by myself for the first time. im proud of myself.","today i got really uncomfortable when i was home around 4:30 because my parent are constantly fighting and i knew it was only going to get worse, so i told them that i wanted to go to the mall with ""friends"". i came alone. its now 6:50 and ive been at the mall for a while, it was really calming just being by myself, listening to music and spending money senselessly i came in with around $68. i now have $1. i bought a beanie, 2 books about psychology, some incense and fragrance oils, and a stuffed animal for my lovely girlfriend who helps me through my manic and depressive episodes (im bipolar 2 as well). today was a great day. im proud of myself for overcoming my anxiety of being seen alone. my parents may not be the best in the past, but they're becoming more and more accepting of my horrible mental health (my horrible mental health is caused by them). i have a psychiatrist, and im lucky enough that i get therapy through my school. im on latuda to keep me somewhat stable, still working up on the doses, im currently on 60mg for a week and a half, then i go up to 80mg. at the end of that i report back to my psych about how latuda is working out for me, its working decent now, maybe the 80mg will give me the somewhat mental stability i need to make it through those days where i have horrible mood swings and im all over the place. its also somewhat helping with my anxiety too, not a whole lot, but it keeps my thoughts a bit more at ease. anyways the movie is starting now, if you're wondering, im seeing shazam. kinda one of the only ones i can get into considering im 13. i hope this post encourages you to stay strong and try your hardest to not let anxiety get the best of you. you're an amazing and beautiful person. i dont know who's reading this far down, but if you are; i appreciate you. have a good day!",33,2019-04-09 06:08:58 EDT-0400

520,Does anyone struggle with needing to be every type of person?,"Okay so let me expand a bit on what I'm meaning. Basically I go through stages, where i am gripped by my anxiety, where i feel like i need to embody how other people are. By that, I mean i feel like i need to keep changing who i am in order for people to like me.

For example, I recently watched a short video on FB taken from a British reality TV show. In it this girl didn't drink alcohol due to personal reasons, so this lead me down a mini anxiety trip of feeling like if I didn't drink people would think I was different and like me.

I know this sounds absolutely absurd and it's so wrong to be thinking like that, but I have this constant need to be liked by everyone & I'm also worried that I'll never find who i really am as a person. This then leads me down a whole other path of anxiety riddled thoughts and I end up putting myself in such a hole that I become so unproductive and I hate myself for it.

I'm so tired, I want to achieve something in life but I'm literally doing nothing with my life and when I see other people doing stuff, it's like, I should be more like them. I should be motivated and I should be who they are so people like me and make people proud of me.

Sorry for this vent, I feel like I've gone off on a bit of a tangent at the end there, but I have no one to talk to about these feelings & I wanted to know if it's a common thing or not. ",10,2019-04-08 04:36:40 EDT-0400

524,Got a job,"So I finally got a job, I've been searching for a while but nothing really worked out until now. I'm happy to an extent. But at the same time, I feel incredibly low. It's just that I thought the anxiety and guilt of not having one would fade once I got hired, but it just turned into the fear of messing up. It's not like they expect me to know everything or work flawlessly as I'm currently in training, I'm aware of that. I'm just terrified of looking like an idiot. I'm barely sleeping (even less than usual) and I'm not leaving the house as much. I guess I'm just on edge a lot for some reason. I would put this under progress though as, despite being pretty young, I had been feeling like a failure just because I wasn't working and that contributed to most my anxiety. Now I am working, at least starting to, and I know that I'm making an attempt to be normal? I'm not sure. I'm kind of mixed on the situation, but I'm sure it'll all work out.",13,2019-04-14 18:36:15 EDT-0400

In January I started training Kickboxing twice a week and I'm having so much fun. The first time I went I felt like I would throw up I was so anxious but I've kept going now and every single training I'm pushing myself to the limit. The best part is the endorphins I get after.

560,I am so angry over what my boyfriend said the other day while I was having an anxiety attack and I need to get it off my chest,"**Edit 3 I was not expecting this many replies. Lots of good points and lots of... comments. I am still reading but I appreciate all the good advice and support. I came here to vent about something, and while I don't necessarily need to defend my relationship to strangers, I'll go ahead and say it because it's making me really anxious that people on the internet are making my boyfriend out to almost sound abusive. We have been together for 3 years, and we've faced A LOT together in the short time (unplanned pregnancy, house flooding, two older children with two very different personalities and issues) and I can say that I have not handled it well and he has been a pretty great rock - but he is human and can only handle so much. I mostly needed to get this off my chest and and see it written out and maybe get some support before I felt confident enough to discuss it with him. and I mean confident in that I have my thoughts clear, not because I am scared.** 

**We don't necessarily argue a lot, but there is a somewhat on going issue that I do avoid discussing because honestly I can't really verbalize my feelings without sounding like a heartless cunt and it led to the argument, so I can see how he thought the anxiety attack was maybe on purpose, but his response was uncalled for. I accept some responsibility for how things went down because of my constant side stepping of the issue. We're far from a perfect couple but we do try. I also phrased part of my initial post poorly, insinuating that he berates me until I am a babbling sobbing mess. He doesn't - but I'm not sure how to explain it without easily other than he's tired of me avoiding the issue. Include other dynamics of me being stressed and I usually end up in tears no matter what.** 

**I see though how my intro sentence set off a lot of red flags for a lot of you and I do appreciate the concern from those who it maybe resonated a past relationship where it was verbal abuse and wanted me to GTFO. I also do take medication daily for depression and anxiety and am trying to find a new therapist who isn't across town with terrible traffic and that I actually can bond with. I'm sure many of you understand the need to feel comfortable with a therapist! Well, if you came back to read this update and are still with me, thank you for letting me get all of this off my chest. Thank you for the replies, even the ones telling me to leave him, because I realize for many of you my poor phrasing set off alarm bells.**



Edit 2:guys, please stop telling me to leave him. It is making my anxiety way worse at this point. I've given one glimpse of one shitty time. Yes there are things we need to work on but I didn't come here for relationship advice. And yea maybe we will break up.
But I came here to vent about one specific incident. I appreciate all of your feedback and several many of you have given great feedback and points of views I hadn't thought about and I haven't even read them all, but please stop the ""just leave him"".

Every time we argue he won't let up, and it ends up getting to the point I'm in tears begging him to leave me alone and we will talk later when I'm not tripping over words. I started having a panic attack, hyperventilating to the point I felt like I'd pass out. He told me I need to stop avoiding the discussion. I said (in broken words because I couldn't freaking breathe) I'm not having an anxiety attack on purpose to avoid anything. His reply? ""that's all anxiety attacks are, are to avoid doing things!"" 

I guess in a sense that could be true, but hearing the way he said it just made me feel even worse. I had to call out of work because it was so bad and calling out on a holiday weekend is a HUGE deal - like you can be written up and potentially fired. I'd love to not have severe anxiety that keeps me from working. But saying that like I purposely give myself anxiety attacks to avoid anything, or that anyone with anxiety has attacks on purpose, like I'm sitting there planning it! I've never felt worse about having anxiety than I did at that moment. I have severe depression as well, and now I don't even want to get out bed because my depression and anxiety are closely working together to remind me that I suck and everyone hates me and here have an anxiety attack over trying to *not* avoid any conversation at all otherwise people will hate you even more for avoiding the conversation with that pesky ""anxiety""

I just needed a rant. Thanks.

I've been lurking on r/Anxiety for a few months now and have never posted/commented. I am new to the world of anxiety (I started having panic attacks, shortness of breath, feelings of  tight chest/throat back in May after I started exercising and counting calories. I had to stop tracking my food because it got so bad. New life challenges have kept the anxiety around). 

If there is anything I am grateful for through these challenges, is I now have a deeper respect and admiration of those who have dealt with this for any amount of time and have learned how to cope and thrive.

I'm grateful for this community and the support I see. I seriously look forward to learning new strategies and celebrating progress/success with you all.",9,2019-09-03 03:20:56 EDT-0400
571,"My brain is so foggy, and my grades are suffering","I suffer from generalized anxiety, which most likely stems from my PTSD. I was abused by my parents for years, and it came to a breaking point where I was kicked out of the house. 

At the present time, my grades are slipping. I just can‚Äôt concentrate, and it can be hard to impossible for me to think clearly. I‚Äôve tried medication and I‚Äôm doing therapy, but I know therapy will take a while before I start to really see results. My anxiety gets so bad sometimes that it makes me physically ill.

Whenever I get anxiety ill talk to it and reassure it that I'll be OK and give thanks to it for being concerned. I imagine this tiny bird sitting on my shoulder giving me negative thoughts but I smile because this little bird will fly off and I know when to expect it too land again and each time I'll greet it. Whenever I need to do something beneficial but have anxiety ill look to my shoulder and say ""it's OK little one, I'm here and let's both tackle this challenge together"".

574,Survived a panic attack in the middle of nowhere,"I just got back from a week in South Africa (I‚Äôm American), and had a lovely time with limited anxiety until the last night when my girlfriend and I stayed on this game reserve... first of all the chalets were 4km from the office/road and we were the only 2 guests. No cell phone service or phones in the chalet and the only humans being that far made me nervous, but I was ok. There were rhinos only steps away from where we were sleeping but that didn‚Äôt scare me. I was good. 

Until I overdid it on the wine. The host was super nice and he kept the wine poured during dinner; not once was I smart enough to remind myself that too much alcohol often causes me to wake up in the middle of the night with my heart racing. We finished dinner, he left back to his home, and it was just us, some giraffes and rhinos left. I went to sleep ok, thanks to the wine... but yeah, I woke up soon after (not sure how soon, never saw a clock) 

My heart was not only racing but pounding in my body. I immediately began panicking, which of course made it worse. I didn‚Äôt have my Apple Watch or cell phone on, thank goodness, bc I know it would have made it worse to measure my pulse but it felt like it was 160+. I climbed over my girlfriend into the bathroom and tried to wash my face with cool water (it was cold, but I was sweating). Of course my mind went to heart attack, but I told myself that panic attacks and alcohol related tachycardia happen to me and I‚Äôve never died. I drank some water, laid back down and I couldn‚Äôt sleep bc my heart stayed a constantly fast pace... I kept trying to roll over and try different positions so that I couldn‚Äôt feel my heart pounding but it was hard. 

Of course all I could think was that I was in the middle of nowhere with no help available. I didn‚Äôt want to involve my girlfriend bc it freaks her out which makes me worse. I laid there and took deep breaths , trying to ignore my pulse. I tried not to think about being in the middle of nowhere. After sending myself to the ER before with a pulse of 160 and being told it was nothing more than anxiety (and having to pay $1,200), I told myself I would not freak myself out enough to go to the hospital again. Hell, I couldn‚Äôt have at this point haha. 

Finally, finally drifted off to sleep and woke up hours later and my pulse was back to normal. I was incredibly relieved that I made it through the night with only mild anxiety and not the major freak out it could have been.",7,2019-09-05 00:41:35 EDT-0400

I felt really odd just rambling and crying to a stranger, but it did ultimately help. My boyfriend came home a few minutes later and so I went to spend time with him. It still took a while to settle down, but I finally was able to. I just want to really advocate using this hotline if you need it.

It was the scariest thing when he came out because he was bigger than I expected (I‚Äôm tall, but not big) and this guy was like a truck and I just stood there asked him to please turn it down.

591,"Read this, please, it's for you","Hi. I'm not here to write about me. I just want to leave you an important message, hoping that it will help you and, maybe, even save your life.

The message is: If you have a problem, specially if it's considerably affecting your life, you should talk about it to someone you trust as soon as possible. I suggest you talk to a parent or a relative, but if you don't feel helped by them, then talk about it to another adult (for example a therapist, a counselor or, if you're in school age, a teacher) or, generally, a friend. I know, you may feel uncomfortable with it, think it's not worth it, think you don't deserve it, think you have to do by yourself, but please, if you are suffering, TALK. You deserve help, no matter what.

Asking for help is NOT a sign of weakness, it's a sign of strength. If you feel it's too much to go through it alone, don't be afraid of seeking help. If you don't get the help you need once, remember that it's not your fault, and look for it somewhere else. Trust me, there's someone who can lessen your burden out there.

And, most of all, be kind to yourself. Other people can take care of you, but you also have to learn how to take care of yourself.

596,sometimes I wonder how people without anxiety operate,"I have learned to manage my anxiety to a point where I can live a normal life, go to school, and really be an overall happy person.. but it feels like it will always be lurking in the background for me. 
I‚Äôll be driving, and then I play out scenarios in my head where I get into car accidents, or my loved ones suddenly die from an accident, and I think about what I would feel/think/do. I constantly worry that I have cancer, or some incurable, life altering disease, whenever I have an ache or pain. Or, when nothing is wrong at all. 

Being late is never an option, so I‚Äôm always incredibly early to any place I need to go to.. just to be sure that I won‚Äôt be anxious about the possibility of being even a minute or two late. I feel anxious about the jobs I‚Äôll be able to get. If I‚Äôm good enough for what I want to really do with my education. I worry about my weight and body constantly. I worry about if people secretly harbor bad feelings towards me. I could go on and on and on about all of the dumb shit my mind comes up with on a daily basis. 

I feel like my anxiety is just such an integral part of myself, when by medical standards I‚Äôm ‚Äúbetter‚Äù from the very worst of it that I experienced. I‚Äôve always been an anxious person. My mom has told me things about me when I was a young child where I had behaviors that I still have today, usually all rooted in my anxiety. 

This is a random ramble, but I‚Äôm just really tired of always thinking like this. It seems like even though I‚Äôm ‚Äòbetter,‚Äô I‚Äôm never going to be like the effortlessly carefree people that I know. Guess I‚Äôll keep learning to cope.",16,2019-09-19 06:28:54 EDT-0400

600,'For as long as I remember... As far back as I can tell from my memory... There was no 'before'...'-group?,"((This is my first post ever on Reddit, so I hope I'm doing this right.))

TL;DR: Lifelong anxiety, how to handle, cope, fix or cure? Because I never found someone 'like me'. (Not being arrogant... Don't know how to say it otherwise...)

We all have this same goal; reduce the anxiety to a level at which it's manageable, right? Because really becoming fearless is highly unlikely (and I think not healthy.)
But we all have a different starting point. 
Some had a bad experience 6-7 months ago... 
Some had a trauma 6-7 years ago... 

But there's also a group of people who are suffering from their anxiety as long as they can remember. From 'birth'
I'm one of them, unfortunately. I'm diagnosed with a Generalized Anxiety Disorder with panic attacks which resulted in a deep depression on the side. Served on a plate of Avoidant Personality Disorder. 

People of 'my group', has anyone a working coping mechanism?
I'm just so tired.. 16 years of, different approached cognitive behavioural therapy based, talking.. 10-11 years of swallowing various medication options. 
26 years of exposure in vivo. 
Meditation, walking, exercising, etc. 
And nothing really changed. 

It's also hard to work when you don't have a memory you can fall back on. A memory of how life was without anxiety. Then you have some handles to hold onto. A goal of which you can calculate the distance. 
I just don't know what to expect of life. 
I find that very hard. 

Also I don't have parents to blame. No divorce, alcoholic dad, or emotional  numbed mom
My parents and family are full of love and understanding. And always helping me finding ways to achieve some small successes.
Only problem I see is being raised over-protective. But I find the punishment 'life long anxiety' out proportion. You know what I mean? (Also another thing I find hard to cope with. The guilt my parents feel about me suffering though life.)

For some context:
26 years old, living at home, studying anything and everything that interests me (music, electrical engineering, webdesign, graphic design, Sketchup, literature, health, etc), hardly ever go outside, holidays are awful. No experience in relationships, never had a girlfriend, never had sex, never kissed a girl. Miraculously finished high school. Unemployed - Not searching.  And luckily I got a few good friends left who are empathic and occasionally help me with my exposure objectives. ('Mission 1: get outside'). 
And many more things I can tell, but...

How do you hold on? What technique or therapy really helped you? Or if it's possible, how did you get better? From a life long state of anxiety to a manageable dose.   

Can someone help me out with info? 
Thanks in advance!",4,2019-02-01 03:24:01 EST-0500

603,Anxiety Getting Worse - Need Advice,"Hello, 

I have been experiencing more anxiety lately within the past month or so, than usual. I am an introvert and highly sensitive person, so I usually have some level of anxiety, but now it feels much worse suddenly. I keep having constant unwanted thoughts about my past negative experiences with men (allowing people to take advantage of me, not respecting myself, random hook-ups that I regret) out of the blue, which I am constantly fighting against in my head, making me feel exhausted. I have also noticed that I am just more anxious about everything in general, especially in social situations (I am shy and introverted already, so it just feels amplified now). 

I also feel like I might be experiencing some depression too. I have had a low mood, lack of interest in my usual hobbies and passions, lack of motivation to exercise and do anything, negative self-esteem and low confidence and overall feelings of sadness and wanting to cry randomly. 

I don't know what's going on with my brain but this anxiety and possible depression is making me even more anxious. 

I have visited my naturopath who prescribed me Vitamin B, Vitamin D, Magnesium, Omega 3s and a herbal treatment with St. John's Wort, Passionflower and Valerian. I have been taking the vitamins consistently for months, but just started the herbal treatment a few days ago and haven't noticed a difference yet. 

I have an appointment set up with my doctor and a therapist early next week. Nothing has really changed in my life recently, except from being in a stressful and overwhelming job, which I started last summer. I have noticed that I have been feeling more stressed since then.

615,"I'm powerless, I'm suffering.","A little over a week ago, perhaps 2 weeks ago now my wife got sick in the middle of the night which woke me up. Shortly after I myself started feeling sick so I went downstairs and convinced myself that I was just in my own head. My heart was beating a million beats per second, I was sweating, shaking, and nauseous. After convincing myself I was just being silly I finally calmed down but this took hours and hours of standing in my kitchen trying to calm down. By the time I finally felt comfortable enough to fall asleep it was about 5am and I had to call in to work because I needed to be at work at 8.   


I woke up at about 9 and got very little sleep, I spent that day taking care of my wife trying to make her feel better. I didn't have an appetite the whole day and outside of feeling a bit sleepy I actually felt fine. That night before bed the very same symptoms washed over me and I spent the whole night standing in the kitchen again trying to calm myself down once more. Heart racing, shaking, nauseous, tired. I went to bed around 5am again and again called in sick to work.   


My wife was at this time fully recovered, I hadn't told her what was going on as I didn't want her to worry/think I am weird. When she came down that morning at about 9am to see why I was asleep on the couch I told her I had really bad insomnia and had fallen asleep down there. That night while I felt very nervous about having this happen again I was so tired from lack of sleep that I finally fell asleep at about 9 but I woke up early that morning at about 4am and had to run to the bathroom with horrible diarrhea. After that was done I got worried again and started shaking, I felt like the walls of the house were closing in on me and felt like if I didn't leave the house I was going to be ill. So I went to work very early and told my boss I was just trying to catch up on work that I was behind on from calling in. I lied to my wife and told her that I got an on-call and needed to go in early. (again the thought of her worried about me makes me anxious). I got into my office and much like I would in the kitchen I sat in my office and calmed myself down then felt completely fine. 

&#x200B;

That night rolled around and I started having those extreme feelings of dread wash over me like I was becoming ill again. I had to tell my wife at this point what was going on, so I told her that I just needed to get out of the house for a minute, so I went to Walgreens panicking the whole way there but as soon as I got there I started to feel completely normal. Once I got there I was hoping to buy zzzquil but ended up getting NyQuil to basically force myself to sleep. I took it and fell asleep woke up the next morning feeling GREAT that I had finally gotten a nights sleep.  


Every single day now for going on over a week, I spend the whole day feeling completely fine. As soon as I get home I feel twinges of anxiety but I tell myself if I just take my mind off it I'll be fine so I read and watch TV. Sometimes I'm okay until about 7pm then the very same horrible feelings wash over me, I leave the house and go stand in my office in the middle of the night until I'm calm, then go home drink some NyQuil and go to sleep. Sometimes I'm fine until even later, I wake up at like 2am and start panicking then have to leave the house to calm down at my office some more before going back.  


My wife has been going through a very hard time emotionally with the loss of our pregnancy and being depressed because of work. I want to be able to be there for her, but I spend all night at the office trying to calm down. We went on a date yesterday in hopes that getting out of the house would make me okay and she could tell I was miserable the whole time. This anxiety, wherever it has come from is completely controlling my life. I don't know what to do, I don't know where to look. I'm becoming extremely depressed because I miss my wife, I just want to be able to be home with her in her time of need. The more depressed I get the more anxiety I feel.   


I am completely lost, I've never in my life suffered anxiety.",2,2019-02-01 08:10:10 EST-0500

618,I always feel like I'm going to die soon.,"Hi everyone! I hope my post finds you all well. I was hoping to vent a bit here and maybe get some advice. 

I've been suffering from really terrible anxiety and what started as overwhelming fear of home invasions moved into health anxiety and hypochondria. Anything that I feel physically I immediately make into a fake illness. If I have a stomach ache it's probably a rare illness from those leftovers I had yesterday, if my head hurts it's a tumor, etc. 

It's been putting a strain on my life and I don't know how to make it better. Any advice is welcome! ",2,2019-02-01 04:50:51 EST-0500

620,Hospital system just assign me with cute psychiatrist which almost paralyze me.,"I always have problem to act appropriately with women stranger since I broke up with my ex. By appropriate. I mean finding something to talk and thinking straight. I always tell myself that I shouldn‚Äôt talk about my ex to any women if she doesn‚Äôt ask about it.

Most of the times my psychiatrist is always mens or middle aged lady.

This time, I don‚Äôt know how and why hospital just assign me with cute young doctor around my age she wear glasses and have resemble with my ex.

The moment I saw her I say with my self ‚ÄúOH CRAP, RED ALERT HOW CAN I TELL HER ABOUT MY SYMPTOMS‚Äù 
‚ÄúYOU NEED TO TELL HER ABOUT YOUR RECENT DEVELOPMENT AND HOW YOU STILL MISS YOUR EX SO SHE CAN FIND A WAY TO TREAT YOU‚Äù

I feel like I can‚Äôt talk about my ex in front of her but you need to fake it.

So I talk about my anxiety on my job finding stagnation while my mind scream ‚ÄúTALK ABOUT YOUR EX, SHE IS HERE TO TREAT YOU, TELL HER.‚Äù

I notice that my talking speed start to slow down. I find that I keep avoid her eye contact and my mouth hardly move.

Then I tell har about my ex but I find it hard to express aspects that psychiatrist need to know because I feel somewhat attract to her.

Then she ask me ‚Äúso, are you still looking for girlfriend ?‚Äù This question almost break me down. My Id tell that she is flirting with me while my superego tell me she is doing what she supposed to do and also wall of psychiatrist ethics bar her from dating me if she really wish so.

If she really want to date me and really date me it would be nice. but having her as my psychiatrist is making me really uncomfortable and kinda hinder my treatment.

So far I haven‚Äôt told my hospital to avoid incident like this, it‚Äôs really not her fault too. I want to express this.

Thing is nurse office and department administration is right in front of her office I can‚Äôt really tell all the nurse that I find this uncomfortable.

I wish I can tell someone or even her that I find her attractive and make me uncomfortable.

So thank r/anxiety to let me use this space. Thank you

621,How CBD has decreased my anxiety,[removed],0,2019-02-01 06:43:02 EST-0500
622,First job interview in years tomorrow & I‚Äôm kinda nervous,"So I (19F) have only had two different fast food jobs back a few years ago when I was in high school. I only stayed at both jobs for a couple of weeks because of my social anxiety & I felt really incompetent. I haven‚Äôt been working the past few years because of lack of confidence. I‚Äôve applied at several jobs & even scheduled interviews for some, but always ended up being too anxious and never show up

But tomorrow morning I have an interview at a dog boarding facility! The job will pretty much be me taking care of the dogs & playing with them. Not too much interaction with humans besides co-workers which to me is a great thing. Even thought I‚Äôm feeling nervous I know I have to show up because a job this good doesn‚Äôt come along often. I can‚Äôt pass it up. 

I‚Äôm mainly feeling nervous about coming off as too awkward or if I say the wrong thing or smothering. I keep overthinking about little things like what do I say when I walk in? 

Overall I know this will be a good thing for me because I‚Äôm 19 & I‚Äôm going to have to get a job at some point. Plus it will be nice to be able to start to save money & be more independent but idk I just hope it all goes well! ",2,2019-02-01 01:04:08 EST-0500
623,DAE struggle with not believing you have anxiety?,"So, I've posted here before but I was wondering how anyone else might handle this.

I have an anxiety disorder but I've gotten better at managing it, learning triggers, and basically just talking it out with my mom, grandmother, and boyfriend. But it's still an every day battle, even right now I'm having mild anxiety about if I washed my hands enough today to avoid getting norovirus. 

Sometimes I get the feeling that this is all in my head. That maybe, even though I've been diagnosed and taken medication and everything, that maybe this isn't real. This can't be real, I can't be this afraid of nothing. I can't be afraid to leave my house, I can't be afraid of just freaking existing. The triggers I have can't really be real. I can't be so afraid of my own body that some days I cringe when I'm about to be touched.

 **These feelings I struggle with day in and day out can't be real.**

625,"after almost canceling an interview today due to anxiety, I forced myself to go, went in there, and killed it!!!!!","I was SO nervous all last night and all day today about this interview. Interviews are a MAJOR trigger for me, I almost always have an anxiety attack in the middle of them, and I‚Äôm really not very good at them. On top of that, it was for a bilingual role and I knew I‚Äôd have to speak German and I was so insecure about my fluency and so freaking anxious that I would totally bomb and embarrass myself. 

I was SO close to canceling. I made a million excuses to my friends in family about why I didn‚Äôt really want the job anyway so I might as well not go. I am so, so glad I didn‚Äôt. 

I experienced a bit of anxiety, but no attacks! I wasn‚Äôt stammering and awkward like I usually am and I was really confident in all of my answers. Best of all, when they brought in the German dude so I could converse with him, he said it was really good and my pronunciation was great, and after he left they all said he‚Äôs Never been impressed by anyone‚Äôs German before!!!

I never feel good or confident after leaving an interview, but this time I do. I Really Really Really hope I get the job (the office is UNREAL, benefits are wild, free breakfast and lunch, everyone was super laid back, better pay) but even if I don‚Äôt, I‚Äôm just so damn proud of myself for forcing myself to go instead of bailing like I always do.

Just had to share because I feel super happy right now. :) wish me luck!

Now to some this may seem like an everyday thing but for me this was a big step. After that I went to my first ever lash lift appointment. I was so unbelievably excited to treat myself to this. I laid down, closed my eyes and the woman began my treatment. I knew from the beginning I had to keep my eyes closed for a good hour and a half but, I had no idea how I would react. Once she had the perm solution on and she took her hands away from my eyes to let it sit it all sank in. I immediately started to feel dizzy and like I needed to open my eyes IMMEDIATELY. Now, a few years ago I would have just sat there through my anxiety attack and just dealt with it because I didn‚Äôt want to bother her. Today, I very politely explained to her that I needed to have it taken off and I would still pay her for the service. She was so kind and understanding that she didn‚Äôt charge me for anything and told me I could always come back and try again another day. Again, to some people this would sound like a failure. I failed to complete the treatment and I felt so overwhelmed, embarrassed, and upset. But, I asked for a different lid today. And that‚Äôs a win in my book.",46,2019-06-28 22:25:51 EDT-0400

634,9 Hacks To Get A Handle On Your Anxiety Right Now,"
Anxiety Hack #1: Get up and move your body!
It‚Äôs pretty hard to give in to feelings of anxiety when you‚Äôre engaged in physical activity and those happy hormones, or endorphins, are getting released. This hack works best if you start moving as soon as you begin to experience those anxious thoughts and the adrenaline creeping in because it‚Äôll prevent the anxiety from escalating. Choose a type of exercise you enjoy or even something childlike, such as bouncing on a trampoline or doing the ‚ÄúCotton-Eyed Joe.‚Äù I dare you to try one of those and not crack a giggle. Also, if possible, take it outside for the extra benefits of sunlight, fresh air, and a dose of vitamin D. 

Anxiety Hack #2: BREATHE.
One of the most effective and simple deep breathing exercises for calming anxiety and overall relaxing is the 4-7-8 breathing technique developed by Dr. Andrew Weil (based off of pranayama yoga.) 
Here‚Äôs how you do it:
Find a quiet and comfortable place to either lie down or sit up straight with good posture.
Rest the tip of your tongue on the roof of your mouth, right behind your front teeth.
Let your lips part and make an obnoxious whooshing sound as you exhale through your mouth.
Then, with your lips closed, inhale through your nose as you count to 4.
Hold that breath for 7 counts.
Exhale from your mouth for 8 counts. Don‚Äôt forget the annoying ‚Äúwhoooooooshhhhh!‚Äù It‚Äôs key. ;)
Do this at least four times.

Anxiety Hack #3: Repeat affirmations.
Saying affirmations out loud to yourself may seem out there, but can be extremely powerful when it comes to taming anxiety. The following affirmations have worked for me at the peak of an anxiety attack when I‚Äôve felt crippled by that impending feeling of doom and darkness. 
‚ÄúI am okay.‚Äù
‚ÄúI‚Äôve been here before. This too shall pass.‚Äù
‚ÄúI am more than my anxiety.‚Äù
‚ÄúI will transform my anxiety into positive, calming energy.‚Äù
‚ÄúI breathe out tension and breathe in serenity.‚Äù
‚ÄúI breathe out fear and breathe in love.‚Äù
‚ÄúI will overcome this like I always do. I am getting stronger and stronger.‚Äù
‚ÄúI am safe within myself. There is nothing to fear.‚Äù
‚ÄúMy body is filled with loving and calming energy.‚Äù

Anxiety Hack #4: Write it out.
Journaling, or just jotting down those thoughts that are running through your mind at the speed of light, in the moment can bring you some peace. If you don‚Äôt have a journal, use the notes section of your phone and write out whatever thoughts you have running through your mind. Whether it‚Äôs a to-do list of things you need done by the end of the week, a poem, or a bunch of swear words, writing it down (or typing it out) is a form of release. Trust me, you will feel some tension lift.

Anxiety Hack #5: Listen to feel good music.
Music has a powerful effect on your mood and energy. The key is to listen to happy, calming music, even if that‚Äôs not the type of music in your Spotify library. Choose music that reflects the way you want to feel and that will soothe your anxious mind. Personally, my go-to for happy, relaxing beats is anything by Kygo, Sam Feldt, or Bonobo.

Anxiety Hack #6: Get in touch with your spiritual side.
Connecting to a higher power is pretty much a guaranteed way of calming down feelings of anxiety. Whether you choose to pray, meditate, chant mantras, or hold crystals, doing something spiritual will help ground you and give you peace of mind. My favorite way to calm my restless mind at night is to take an epsom salt bath, turn on my latest Headspace meditation, close my eyes, and just focus on my breathing. Actually, this combines three anxiety hacks into one 10-minute activity - meditating (getting in touch with my spiritual side), deep breathing (hack #2), and self-care (hack #7). 

Anxiety Hack #7: Show yourself some tender love and self-care.
There‚Äôs nothing better than stopping an anxiety attack in its tracks by doing something pleasurable for your mind and body. When you feel those dreaded, worry-filled thoughts manifest in your body as a rapid heartbeat or sweaty palms, throw your hands up, say ‚Äúthat‚Äôs enough!‚Äù and go treat your poor body like royalty. Get a massage, give yourself a facial treatment, get a mani-pedi, take a bath, get your hair did, anything that you know will make you feel good, physically. Taking care of yourself and your body is therapeutic. Self-care is a form of self-love and self-love produces positive thoughts and emotions, which crowd out those negative, fearful feelings.

Anxiety Hack #8: Love your anxiety.
Yes, you read that right. One of the ways we tend to make our anxiety worse is by judging it and ourselves as something negative and horrible that needs fixing. If there‚Äôs one thing you take away from reading this article, I hope it‚Äôs this -  every belief or behavior has a positive intention, therefore any negative thoughts or destructive behaviors are not the problem. They are just the best solution you have come up with so far.
What if, instead of looking at your anxiety as something you hate and want to ‚Äúfix‚Äù, you saw it as the only way your mind knows how to cope with whatever it is you are dealing with? What if you looked at your battles with anxiety as victories that make you a stronger person? What if you listened to what your anxiety is trying to tell you and focus on fixing that problem?
The thing about anxiety is, we put so much energy, time, and money into trying to heal the symptoms of anxiety when what we really need to heal is the fear or trauma that triggers this unnerving cascade in the first place. Which brings me to the last hack‚Ä¶

Anxiety Hack #9: Listen to and get acquainted with your body.
If you‚Äôre experiencing symptoms of anxiety and you have no clue why or where they‚Äôre coming from, it‚Äôs time to take a closer look at your lifestyle choices and health. Three of the top anxiety triggers are caffeine, sugar, and alcohol. If you‚Äôre consuming any or all of these, try eliminating them from your diet for a few weeks, preferably a full month. Then, slowly add one in at a time to see how your body responds. Chances are, you won‚Äôt go back and if you do, you‚Äôll find a healthier and more moderate way to integrate it into your lifestyle. 
Health issues, hormonal imbalances, and food allergies can also trigger anxiety. Make sure you know what‚Äôs going on inside your body. Knowledge about your body‚Äôs natural tendencies and providing your body with nourishing, whole foods is groundbreaking when it comes to managing your anxiety. Once you‚Äôre more in touch with your body and its needs, you begin to trust your mind and body and their reactions. You‚Äôll begin to feel energy shifts when you walk into rooms or engage with others. Your intuition becomes clearer and you‚Äôll be able to tell the difference between ‚Äúgood vibes‚Äù and ‚Äúbad vibes‚Äù...and act accordingly.",59,2019-06-28 10:36:46 EDT-0400

645,"Does anyone else get anxious when their partner is away? Not because you don't trust them, but just because they're not there?","So me and my boyfriend are together for almost a year and he's been living with me since the first of January. We are inseparable, and with that, I mean it literally. If I go to another room, he will come too. We both don't really have friends so we are always together and we love it. Call it a honeymoon fase, we don't think it is. We have a really big love for each other as we are both in very difficult situations and we finally found someone who understands and who's there. 

This weekend it was time for a festival he goes to every single year and he would love for me to come along. I'm in a wheelchair due to a physical disease and I didn't know if I could make it through the whole weekend (Thursday 10AM-Sunday 2AM). We got access to a wheelchair camping and we had a very comfortable place. I loved it there. I saw some bands I really love, and everything we did just felt great. I was on cloud nine to be honest. But that all crashed down when I had to leave yesterday. I was in so much pain that my painkillers didn't work anymore and I could barely breathe. We had to make the decision that I would go home, and he would stay there. It would be our first night without each other in more than 8 months. He always goes with a group of 'friends'. He knows one person from when he was a child and the rest he knows through her. But they don't really talk to him. They let him tag along and only talk to him when they need something. I had to leave him behind with them. He would still sleep on the separate camping but would hang out with them. While he didn't drink at all in the two and a half days that I was there, the moment I was gone he started drinking. He said he was scared he couldn't get me off wheelchair ramps anymore and I guess that's a legit reason and he means it, he's sweet like that. He sent me some videos of bands I had to miss and he was singing along really loud while he ever sings, and even though we went to one of his favourite bands the night before he just sat next to me on the wheelchair stage and didn't do a thing apart from cuddle me. It looks like he's having a lot more fun now that I'm gone. He keeps reassuring me that that's not true and that he misses me. I'm having a really hard time believing that because I'm incredibly insecure and it just seems like he's having the time of his life now that I'm gone. I know he means it when he says he wants me there, but when I see him having fun like that I feel like a major burden. 

Back to the point. It was my first night without him and it felt like he would never come back, even though I know he's coming back tonight. It still feels like I'll never see him again. Does anyone else feel that way when their partner is gone? It's not that I don't trust him, I know that he's loyal and he's absolutely the sweetest guy ever. And yet I'm incredibly anxious. I cried really hard when we said goodbye at the festival and he held me for a while. And I'll probably cry when he comes back. He promised to come back immediately after the last show, which will be around 1:30 AM. I hope he does. It still feels like I said goodbye forever. One side of me knows that that's bullshit and that he'll be back soon. But my anxiety keeps telling me he's never coming back home. What do you guys do when that happens?

UPDATE: HES HOME! HES HOME! he was so done with his friend group and didn't enjoy it anymore because I wasn't there and he came home even though he wouldn't be home until 3/4AM this night and he arrived at 7PM! He just crawled up against me and we snuggled until we both felt whole again. He had a really bad time after I left and I feel so bad for him (also a little flattered and glad he feels the same way but don't tell anyone :p). I'm just gonna cuddle him and softly stroke his hair until he feels better. Thank you for letting me know I'm not alone in this!",11,2019-06-23 18:31:25 EDT-0400

I started my conversation with the usual anxiety tag, ""I know I don't have to ask you about this, but..."" and she understood. Not only was she cool with me catching up with old friends (not the big deal and I knew subconsciously it was ok), but she was cool that I was upfront with how anxious I was in telling her about it (big deal).
Not many people get how big of a deal it is to just to have that question ""Is it Ok if I..."" answered, and to accept why you ask it means everything. The ones that do get it accept you for who you are regardless of your insecurities.",9,2019-06-23 22:50:27 EDT-0400
648,One of my biggest problems is avoidance. How do you get yourself to be productive when the thought of facing anything is overwhemlming?,"Right now I'm meant to be doing uni work but I feel such an overwhelming feeling of stress around it that it sends me into panic. Its become habit now that I just completely block out anything that causes me stress, instead of dealing with things head on. I just stick my head in the sand like an ostrich and hope for my problems to go away, when I should be just adressing them. 

A lot of the time its just stupid small things, like checking emails, or starting on an essay. Its paralysing, and I feel like people see me as lazy, when the reality is I feel incapable of putting myself in a position where I might have a panic attack. The worst part is the avoidance of different situations creates more problems for me. 

How do you go about tackling things that cause you immense stress? Do you have any tactics or advice?",12,2019-06-28 18:03:39 EDT-0400

Over the past year, however, I have been the victim of harassment by an employee at this gym, so I stopped going about 6 months ago. It's been a struggle to work up the courage to find a new gym because the thought of getting adjusting to a whole new environment, classes, instructors was anxiety inducing. 

However, I went to a new gym for the first time today. The front desk woman was kind and helpful. The class instructor was encouraging. A woman from the class showed me where to get towels. All these very small things may seem silly, but it really helped me stay calm in a new environment. I hope I'm able to go back, maybe even tackle the next anxiety-inducing monster- the lap pool.

Switched to another job where I don't push myself and my boss only has vague advice like ""you can do better"" or ""you have so much potential"" but never says anything more than that. I have tried therapy for most of that time but never got any good advice. Never had a relationship, don't have any friends. And now I am starting to panic about my physical shape because all my coworkers are into CrossFit or some sort of gym activity and that's ALL they talk about (at my previous job people at least talked about other things). And yet I don't feel motivated to do anything. Every day, for the past years, other than therapy it was just spending most of my work procrastinating, getting home and plopping down in bed despite not having done almost anything the whole day. Before I thought I was just depressed (and yet none of my previous therapists even mentioned the word ""depression""), but now I am being taken over by outright PANIC. I feel like all my good years have past me by, and I will never have anything. I will never have a good career, I will never have a relationship, and my body will keep wasting away until I am bedridden. And I have nothing to show for it.

Your heart is pounding and occasionally skipping? You guessed it, also normal. Those feelings of dread and like everything is gonna go wrong? Yep, normal and goes hand in hand with all these sensations when we're too aware of them. 100% of the sensations you're feeling and going through are normal in every day life, We're just unfortunately hyper aware of them. We feel a pain or uncomfortable sensation and our minds immediately go to the worst possible scenario, death, but that won't be the outcome.

I was out there for almost two years and this week, it ended. The relationship was plagued with so much anxiety, much of it irrational on my part. I used him as my anxiety security blanket, and he just soaked it all up and bottled it up without communicating until it became too much on top of his other stress. We definitely both love and care for each other, but our compatibility and timing in life is just off. The relationship was unfulfilling for me (mainly due to lack of quality time together), and I was incredibly lonely and depressed. I am so proud of myself though, I did so many scary things in these past 1.5 years, despite my anxiety! I moved out of my parent's house, moved five hours away alone, got my masters, had a long-term relationship, ended a long-term relationship... and I survived it all.

711,Today was one of the good days and I don't have anyone to share it with...,"I drove in the carpool lane, I got stuck in bumper to bumper traffic for over an hour, I drove in the dark on the freeway and switched lanes, I went around slower people and didn't stay in the slow lane. I didn't spend the entire drive white knuckling or even have to spend the entire drive exit after exit telling myself ""just get to the next exit and then you can pull over."" I didn't compensate for my panic by constantly changing the radio... I just fucking drove. What's even more  I did this all on the stretch of freeway I had my first full fledged panic attack on and I didn't even have to use my emergency medication.

It's just one day and I know tomorrow could be shit but today I did a hell of a lot. The most I've ever done since I've started acknowledging and treating my anxiety.  To most people it's just driving like a normal human but for me it was HUGE. I am so proud of myself but don't have anyone to share it with but I thought this community might understand.

736,Does anyone else get incredible anxiety when sleep deprived?,"Whenever I'm awake for too long, I get anxiety, even though I have nothing to feel anxious about.

When I force myself to go through it, I end up feeling incredibly unwell (nauseous, low pressure, tachycardia) once or twice before I start having full-on panic attacks. Then the crisis keeps going and I have to wait until they pause so I, again against my plans, can go to sleep. 
It seems there's no way out. I hate this and I wish I could push my body when needed like a normal person. 
This always happens when I push myself to stay awake and is really annoying, and also, other people don't understand or trust me and end up seeing me as just undisciplined and unable to have self control (just sleeping because i give in too easily or idk).

770,Random thing I just thought of,"The difference between being anxious vs having anxiety

Being anxious is like having crumbs in your bed after eating toast. It‚Äôs annoying and uncomfortable but you can wash your sheets or brush them off and then you‚Äôre good, and can now sleep in your bed.

Having anxiety is like having a toast grinder over your bed that has an endless supply of toast to grind up and have the crumbs fall on your bed. You can wash your sheets and you can wipe them off. But that‚Äôs temporary as the toast grinder just grinds more toast. Having to constantly wipe crumbs off your bed is tiring and eventually you give up and force yourself to live with the toast crumbs. And people tell you to just wash your sheets, that‚Äôs what they do, but they don‚Äôt understand that it doesn‚Äôt matter if you do, because the toast grinder is just gonna grind more toast. Other people tell you just to stop eating toast in your bed, ignoring the fact that you have a toast grinder with an endless supply of toast above you and you‚Äôre not eating any toast, in fact you‚Äôve started avoiding bread.

-People shouting and being angry. 

-Not caring enough for someone and feel like I'm an asshole towards them 

-People caring about my problems because it think it's not worth anyone caring or even reading this

-................................................. 

- people that don't like me for no reason, I'm sorry.

-Things that never ends AKA going to school every week, almost every months, for every year, then work, until you die. When not at school, being anxious about waking up, going, staying 8 hours then when I head one I only have time to sleep then go again, and i'm supposed to do this 5 days out of 7, for now and then I a few years 6/7 or 7/7 for ever. 

-annoyed people with things I create and I want them to see, i'm sorry you don't have 5 minutes to listen to my heart though my creations. 

-When you die time will fly at infinite speed, off infinite time, and i don't know what will happen exactly when you close your eyes for the last time, but atleast I'm sure one day I'll get the answer

780,Anxiety and Trichotillomania (hair pulling) disorder,"Hi everyone, I was wondering if this sub had any advice on ways to help with my nervous habit of pulling out my facial hair. I suffered from skin picking as a child, but it mostly went away with age. The habit has recently reemerged in the form of picking my facial hair whenever I'm anxious.  I'm going back to school full time and dealing with way more stress than usual. This is especially bad whenever I'm sitting at my computer.  I am desperate to fix this habit. I've pulled off enough of my hair that my face looks spotty, and I know if I continue, the hair will start to no longer grow.   Does anyone have experience with this or skin picking? I've tried meditation, but it doesn't seem helpful here. I tried making it, so my face is always shaved, but that doesn't seem to stop me from pulling hair out.   
I've considered buying some fidget contraption but wasn't sure how helpful it would be.

782,Grounding,"I have been dealing with some rough depression and anxiety for a couple of years and have spent most of my fall college semester in therapy. Today was my last day of my therapy appointment with my school and today I‚Äôm cleared for outpatient! (I‚Äôm excited I had to share. I‚Äôve never completed any sort of therapy- I usually chicken out). In those sessions I learned a new thing about grounding. 

While it may work for some, it didn‚Äôt entirely work for me so I asked if I was doing it wrong. He told me that I‚Äôm not grounding wrong but doing it poorly due to my anxious state. So I want to share this quick tip with you guys and hope it‚Äôll help you too if you‚Äôre in the same boat as me. 

As if it were normal grounding, pick a sense to be your main focus. I recommend hearing or touch. Now, don‚Äôt try to focus on more than one thing with that sense. For example, if you have ocean waves playing in the back, only focus on that. If you‚Äôre laying down, focus on the feeling of that blanket you love so much. If you need a little extra, do both at the same time. I find that this is more relaxing than trying to find 5 things I can see, four things I can hear, etc. 

Maybe you guys knew about it but I learned today and wanted to share! Happy grounding :) 

Add tips below! I‚Äôm always looking for new ways to calm my anxiety and I‚Äôd love to hear something new.",0,2019-11-12 23:07:47 EST-0500

797,Why do people talk about anxiety like if it‚Äôs not a real disorder?,"So I‚Äôm gonna start with my story and yes (I‚Äôm gonna try to keep it as short as possible).
Whatever I a couple of months ago got my first panic attacks. I can tell you that I was convinced that I was about to die or that I had a disease or something. My body started hurting like crazy, I started seeing dots in front of my eyes so could barely walk, i started shaking, I couldn‚Äôt really hear people, I got tinnitus. And believe me when I tell you I had it like this for months later MONTHS, it felt like a constant panic attack and I thought I was going crazy. My parents was about to call an ambulance but didn‚Äôt since they were convinced it was anxiety. 

Whatever when people tell me that they have anxiety over like an exam or some homework. It makes me feel like I really should visit a doctor if that‚Äôs really how anxiety is (which it isn‚Äôt). It makes me kinda mad too cause like I really thought I was dying and other people are saying that they are anxious over these things when they don‚Äôt even have any physical symptoms cause if they would‚Äôve felt real anxiety then they would‚Äôve probably be about to call an ambulance or do something. 

I‚Äôm sorry I just had to write down a little and let people know that anxiety is sooo much more than just worrying. It‚Äôs literally physical symptoms that sometimes can make you feel like you have a deadly disease. It‚Äôs really tough to live with and I‚Äôve had this for a couple of months now but it is getting better but I still feel a lot of physical pain so I usually just stay in my room.

823,"Wholesome ""games"" for the anxious gamer","As a gaming enthusiast who enjoys a wide variety of games, I found those two gems I would like to recommend because they could benefit a lot of people.

1. PLAYNE

In this game you are greeted by a fox telling you that this place called PLAYNE needs your help. There are no trees, no sunset or sunrise etc. Now the cool thing is that this game teaches you meditation and explains the benefits of it(scientifically). There is NO religious ideology attached to it. It has 2 game modes, a habit building mode and a non-habit building mode. Everytime you meditate, the world changes: trees grow, the sun starts moving again and so on. In habit building mode your fire at the fireplace goes out if you miss a day. This doesn't happen in the other mode so you have the choice to choose what fits you best. It's an early access game meaning it's still in active development but the developer is very active and the concept is great. I recommend this game bc of the positive effects meditation can have for anxiety patients and the easy approach without the need of a religious/spiritual framework.

&#x200B;

2. Kind Words

Now this one is heartwarmingly beautiful. You are in a small room with a desk, a shelf and a bed that can be decorated a little. You and other players can send paper planes with a quote you like or just some kind words. They fly past your room and you may or may not click them and read what's in there. Players including you can send requests for example something that worries you, an advice needed etc. You can read them and reply to them if you want to. The same is true for your own requests, you thank the others with an automated thank you note and a sticker. The good thing about this game is: It is anonymous(you choose a name but players only see the first letter, nothing more). It is moderated by a very kind and active team. The game reminds you to be kind and mindful, also to not share identifying info. The letters have a limit, there is no chat function or direct messaging which is important in my opinion. You can report a letter if needed. Health hotlines are available at the click of a button. And the community is great, they also have a discord and the steam forum. I haven't seen a single troll letter or the like in my 8 hours of game time. I recommend this game bc you can never have enough kindness in the world and it may be a first step for some of you to share things that helped you, share experiences and also receive something that benefits yourself.

829,I drowned my baby sister in my mom's birthday,"First of all, excuse my English.

This happened almost 8 years ago, I was 8 and she was about 4.

It was my mothers birthday and we were going to have dinner with all the family (like we always do), adults were outside the house preparing everything, I was on the second floor of the house, with my little sister.

She started crying, it was her baths time but all adults were busy, so I went to the bath and prepared the bathtub, when everything was ready I put her at the bathtub, with champoo and that kind of stuff. I left her alone there and I went to the first floor to watch TV.

When adults came back they asked for my sister, I told them that she was upstairs, having a bath, they seemed worried and they went to the bath, I followed them, I didn't understand the situation.

When we entered the bathroom she had drowned, they took her out of the bathtub and she was almost blue and really cold. Everybody got really nervous, they called 911 and stuff.

So, basically I killed her.

The relation with my family has never been the same. I am still in therapy for it, I have tried to kill myself time ago. In addition I was adopted so I spent months thinking that my family was going to ""give me back.""

My mother has told me several times that it wasn't my fault, but things will never be alright, I know that she is still disgusted of me.

I will never stop feeling guilty, I am really sorry. There is nothing I can do to feel better.",118,2019-06-13 17:44:07 EDT-0400

If the idea of not sleeping right now really stresses you out, get up and do something low impact but productive.

Most of my coworkers are my age or younger and they don't act like that. They don't hide in a closet crying and panicking for two hours. 

I also have a bunch of physical health problems that have caused me to have to leave early and call out numerous times. So I can't help feeling that I'm the problem child at work and everyone must think I'm such a drama queen. There's always *something* going on with me. 

I really try to hide it. I try to tough it out when I can and find private places to rest for a minute when I need it. I try not to let people see me get upset. I wish I could help people understand that I don't *want* to do this or be like this. They never say anything, but I'm certain they're silently judging me.

Anyway... yeah. Anxiety sucks.",56,2019-06-10 16:36:29 EDT-0400

836,Just want to share a few tips on how I tackle my anxiety,"These are just a few things that help me and want to share in hope it can help you too.  

**Keep a pep talk and counter on your phone of how many times your anxiety has been wrong**  
I have a note saved on my phone including a pep talk, something I can read along the lines of ""You're going to be just fine, remember all the other times you felt this way - nothing bad happened and won't happen this time either"" and so on.  I also have a counter of how many times my anxiety has been *wrong* and wasn't justified in the end.  That number is 147 at the moment.  The counter for when my anxiety has been *right* is still at zero.    
I'm somebody who likes statistics and can look at those numbers and think ""Oh, wow, all of those times my brain has been wrong!"" 

**Go somewhere you can think**  
Whenever I'm struggling, I tend to jump in the shower.  The sound of the shower drowns out any other noises, the warmth makes me feel physically comfortable and I can begin to think, run through things in my head properly.  Sometimes I also get into bed, I don't always sleep but sometimes drifting off and waking up hours later *resets* my body.  Though of course, if you're in a strong anxiety attack it's not so easy to just 'go to bed'.  

I suppose this point only applies if I'm at home, but there's no harm in finding a comfortable *safe spot* when outdoors.  

**Have a good, trustworthy friend**  
I don't like running to my best friend whenever I'm having attack because that friend will just get sick and tired of me doing that.  But there's *nothing* wrong with having a friend you can confide in and trust, and most importantly a friend that understands and can say the right thing.  It's also important, when you're not suffering with anxiety, to make an effort to be a good friend to him/her in return.  

My past therapist told me that there's absolutely nothing wrong in seeking help from a friend even on a regular basis, as long as you're not relying on that.  

**Write about it**  
Maybe just because I like writing, but it can actually be very therapeutic.  Whether it's physically writing or writing a blog post on your own blog.  I have an anonymous and private blog, so nobody can see it, and sometimes I'll write in full about my experience and it's almost as if I'm telling a therapist about it.  Reading back my own words immediately after often makes me see my condition/attack in a totally different way.  It's like stepping back and seeing it from another person's eyes.  Our anxiety is in our head but this lets you see it with your eyes and I have no idea if this makes sense but it really helps me.  

**Herbal teas**  
I'm not a tea fan (even though I'm British, I know) but herbal teas are so, so good.  Chamomile is perhaps the best one when it comes to anxiety and calming the nerves.  Peppermint tea is very good if you're getting a nervous stomach, it can help calm things down.  On top of all that, it contains the most healthy thing in the world - water.  Even water alone makes me feel physically better after 30 minutes or so and that in turn (I believe) helps my mind too.  

&#x200B;

I'm aware not all of this will be useful to everyone, maybe none of it will be useful but I'm just hoping - as someone who suffers with these attacks and struggles to get out of them - it'll help at least one person out there!",58,2019-06-11 02:47:34 EDT-0400
837,My mum is dead.,"I‚Äôm adopted so she was my birth mum. I didn‚Äôt know her very well as I was taken from her when I was 18 months. She was an evil woman who did the worst things imaginable to her children. 

I feel so strange. One part of me is so happy she‚Äôs dead, and the other is just thinking over and over and over again my mums dead. She‚Äôs your mother and she‚Äôs dead. I‚Äôm angry I never got to tell her all the things I wanted to, but I‚Äôm relieved I never have to worry about her or see her again. I‚Äôm devastated she‚Äôs gone and I‚Äôm so so worried about how it‚Äôs going to effect everyone. 

I‚Äôm the youngest of three sisters and since I‚Äôm adopted I don‚Äôt really have a say in what‚Äôs going to happen, and I have to wait for information to come through which could take months due to there being an investigation taking place.

838,Anxiety is like having two people arguing in your mind 24/7/365,One is always saying HOLY SHIT WE ARE GOING TO DIE!  And the other one is constantly trying to calm that side down.  It's exhausting.,26,2019-06-10 02:16:57 EDT-0400

843,Recently realized that I've had anxiety for most of my life.,"This will be kind of rambly, so apologies if this doesn't flow/read easily. I just feel like I have to get this off my chest. 

Growing up I was a very shy kid, and would often get extremely nervous when encountered different social situations. I remember when I was like 10 I had my best friend spend the night and just before he arrived, I got in the shower so I wouldn't have to say hi to his dad, even though I had already met him before. I ended up taking a long ass shower and my friend made fun of me about it for the rest of the night lol. Basically I just thought that it was normal for introverts to hate social situations. I'm always been very self conscious about my outside appearance.  I know that everyone gets nervous, but it shouldn't be excessive. I wish I realized that sooner.

I thought I was just shy as my entire family has told me that I'm quiet and shy; but it seems like they didn't realize that my excess shyness was a red flag. I don't blame them; generally speaking they're all extroverted. 

Over the past couple of years in undergrad I think i developed mild GAD. In the mental health shithole that is grad school my GAD got worse (doctor says moderate) for a slew of reasons, and likely triggered a bout of depression and a downward spiral that I've been trying to claw my way out of since February. Been doing counseling since march and started taking zoloft a month ago.

844,Anyone suffer with nighttime anxiety? How do you cope with it? Do you suffer with insomnia due to it?,"I feel anxious randomly throughout the day sometimes, but it‚Äôs more so at night. Sometimes it‚Äôs really bad. Last night I couldn‚Äôt fall asleep until like, 3:30 in the morning, at least, even after taking sleep meds an hour before that. Then woke up with the same anxious feeling I went to sleep with. 

I felt all panicky. My heart was racing. Body was all shaky. Then I popped an Ativan and felt better. But it doesn‚Äôt last all day. :( 

Now afraid of what tonight‚Äôs going to bring.

845,"The worst thing about having anxiety is even if you're a driven, a ''Type A'' goal-oriented person, no matter how much you want to succeed in your goals and do what you need to, anxiety just holds you back from them out of fear, it doesn't matter what type of person you are. Thats anxiety! Thoughts?","I'm a very driven person. I have a lot of ideas, I get things done in spite of anxiety but it is extremely hard and getting harder. I'm curious what others experiences who may be similar to me, are.

&#x200B;

P.S.  I'm thinking about getting on medication because as of right now, I'm not on medication, I believe I could succeed a lot more if I were on something to calm me down and allow me to go after my goals. The reason I highlight goals is I know people who have no goals really and they lack anxiety so I think man if only I had that confidence, I would do so much with it!

847,I will not stop. I will not let it win.,"I might have super duper much anxiety. I might be depressed and yearn for suicide multiple times a day.

I might have extreme mood swings. 

&#x200B;

I say come at me. Come the fuck at me you fucking ass hole. I'm still standing. 4 years in and I'm STILL STANDING. And I will keep standing. I will not draw a line and say ok, you win, and kill myself. You are noise in my head, and you can keep dreaming of winning. Because you won't. I am worthy of happiness, of spontaniety, of friendship, of love, of starting a family of my own, of having kids some day. I am worthy of respect, courage, power, and kindness. I am worthy of all things good that you take away from me. But you are not winning. See, today, I had good moments. I made a new friend, we sat in the sun talking. I met another friend, had a beer and a falafel, also in the sun, also talking about life, scaring seagulls away. Later I read a book that seems good. 

Yes it's mostly dark. And even though the voice in my head says all kinds of stupid shit while I'm typing this, like ""Oh but you don't really think you're gonna get out alive?"", I am writing it. Look at me. I am writing it. I am not letting it win.

870,I am so tired of overthinking.,"I feel like every single hour of my life my mind is filled with ""why did I do that"" events. Those events are always about when I let myself go too far, where I talked too much, broke down, in completely unreasonable circumstances. I have a lot of basic life stress, and a lot of bad/traumatic events in my life, but I don't let anybody know about that. Now in the couple of events that I did tell people that, and primarily the events where I brought out suicidalness, I can't stop thinking about, and it makes every thing that I talked about that brings me stress even more stressful. They didn't ask for me to say that, they didn't ask for me to break down. Ugh, I just hate this. Like why do I feel even worse, feel like they're constantly judging me now, and thinking I need help. I don't want people to help me, I'm perfectly fine. But now that they know, they're going to want to talk to me, they're going to want to be ""soft"" around me, and try not to ""trigger"" me. Just why did I ever tell them in the first place? I'm completely overthinking, but it seems like so much like a rational overthinking (if that makes any sense). I want people to just be them around me, I don't want people to think about me while I'm around them. It's a great big circle, of all of my stressors, and all of the few people knowing of the stressors. I've never had such bad anxiety about my stresses, until I let one person know.

873,My bunny passed away and my thesis is due in six days,"I‚Äôm currently completing an honours degree in biomedical science. I have made amazing progress this year with my anxiety and am on track to graduate with first class honours. If I keep up my grades I am eligible for a PhD scholarship, which will cover my uni fees and give me a decent income while I work on my doctorate. This is all I‚Äôve ever really wanted to do. 

When I started my bachelor degree I was overwhelmed with anxiety and depression. The stress of exams and assignments drove me to constant panic attacks and I wasn‚Äôt eating. My mum noticed I was struggling and brought me a tiny black bunny to keep me company. He was the most beautiful companion I could have ever asked for. I named him Vince and I owe everything to that sweet little man. I suffer with narcolepsy as well, and every time I fell asleep on the floor he would run over to me and either lick my cheek or sit with me until I woke up. If I broke down or had a panic attack he would sit with me for hours on end and kiss my face as I cried. Nothing could calm me down like his sweet little nuzzles. 

He had a lot of health problems in the last few years. I swore I would do anything I could if there was a chance he could still live a happy pain free life. We made it through two big scares after many sleepless nights and thousands of dollars at the vet (literally the best money I have ever spent). And luckily I got another two amazing years with him, even if his head was a bit wonky. 

After six and a half wonderful years, Vince unexpectedly passed away in my arms two days ago. He made the most awful scream as I clutched him and ran to the car to rush to the vet and I realised he was gone. 

I am beyond broken at the moment. My final thesis is due in 6 days and even though I‚Äôm almost done, I just can‚Äôt think straight at the moment. I‚Äôm starting to panic again and I‚Äôm not sure if I can stay in control of it right now. I‚Äôm so scared I‚Äôm going to throw away everything I‚Äôve worked for if I don‚Äôt get this finished on time. I‚Äôve lost my best friend and the one who used to help me through these things and Don‚Äôt know what to do

Update:
Thank you to everyone for the overwhelming support. I wanted to write back to everyone individually but I have been far too busy writing, yayy.

 I absolutely love the idea of dedicating my thesis to Vince. I will definitely be doing this and have started writing a little dedication statement to honour just how amazing he was. 
I‚Äôm still heartbroken, but all of you‚Äôre encouragement has made me realise I need to keep going. I‚Äôm working well at the moment and am making a lot more progress. My anxiety still isn‚Äôt great but at least it‚Äôs dropped down to my normal level of uni stress and I don‚Äôt feel as close to breaking.

878,I just got home from Uber driving on New Years.. I feel amazing.,"Over a year ago I started driving for Uber because we very seriously needed any extra money. I had to stop almost immediately because my anxiety wouldn‚Äôt allow me to in good conscious drive others around. I felt devastated. I felt like a failure. I felt like shit, I couldn‚Äôt help my family when the time needed it. 

I recently picked up where I left off because his work gave a hefty heads up that they were taking off for the holidays for way too much time and it was unpaid. I‚Äôve been doing decent with it. I‚Äôve helped make enough to help us stay afloat and was able to help make sure Christmas was still magical for our kids.

I knew tonight (or last night) would be a big deal, good money. All the time leading up to New Years I‚Äôve been debating if I wanted to put myself through it with my anxiety. I‚Äôve been doing OK but what if it was too much on me? 

I fucking nailed it. I made more in one night/morning than I‚Äôd made the whole week combined. I was sociable! I freaking went places I‚Äôve never driven before. I don‚Äôt know. I feel so on top of the world. I remember feeling my throat tightening in between one ride and thinking ‚Äúit‚Äôs just roads sunny. Just roads‚Äù and was able to calm myself down. I‚Äôve NEVER been able to calm myself down. In fact by the end of the night I was eager for new rides and I was calm. 

Flipping calm, a word I never ever thought I‚Äôd used to describe myself ever.  I don‚Äôt know how long this high will last but.. I‚Äôm glad I can share it with you all. Happy New Years! 

Also, for anyone wondering. I‚Äôm medicated and in therapy and just got out of IOP, I know it doesn‚Äôt always help everyone but I put a lot of it into that. Me getting help. ",4,2019-01-01 12:55:43 EST-0500
879,Panic attack at work.,"I've dealt with anxiety my whole life and recently it has been worse than usual but manageable. 

I can usually manage my symptoms through exercise and breathing exercises and (I don't like admitting it) alcohol.

I occasionally get anxious at work but I can manage by going on a walk or going into the bathroom for some breathing exercises. 

Today was the worst. I turned my head too fast and became extremely dizzy (world spinning, never felt like this before). I sat down and tried to regain my composure but with the dizziness it set off the worst panic attack I've ever had. I couldn't breathe, my heart was racing, I was shaking to the point of tremors. I told my co worker I thought I was gonna pass out. He sat next to me and tried to calm me down and I then asked him to take me to the ER. He did and I was diagnosed with vertigo which had thrown me into an anxiety attack.

Now I still feel im recovering from both the vertigo and my anxiety. And I'm horrified to go back to work. What if just being there throws me into another attack? I'm so embarrassed about this happening in front of all my co workers. What if I start spinning again? The ER dr shrugged off my anxiety and basically said to just deal with it. I plan on calling a psychiatrist tomorrow for an appointment to talk about potential medications. Is there anything else I can do to ease my anxiety for work tomorrow?

Also thanks for reading, I also really needed to vent about this.",3,2019-01-03 02:46:12 EST-0500

884,Somebody please help me.,"So yesterday I made a post about conquering my fear of 17 years of throwing up. I caught a stomach bug that made me sick and threw up twice yesterday. Once at 6 am and again at noon. I haven't thrown up since, but now my mom got the exact same thing but way worse, intense stomach pain, and was throwing up way more, way more frequently, and violently, all within the span of 3 hours. She was taken to the hospital, but hearing her violently throw up while she was here just made me so scared just like it always does when she gets these things. I'm still recovering myself which makes me so scared. I don't want to get it again but worse this time like she had, and that makes me feel awful feeling that way because I was the one who got her sick and I want her to get better. But I'm just so scared again to the point that I taped the door to my room so that way I can isolate myself as much as possible from the rest of the house. Now it's night time and I hate night time in the winter, it makes me feel trapped, scared, and alone, because I've always had this feeling like everything bad happens at night like this. I don't know if I'm just panicking or if I'm still sick, but I feel like I'm gonna throw up again, and now I don't have anyone here to comfort me again if I do and I'm freaking out. How am I ever going to get over / control this fear? I can't take this anymore, my heart is always racing, I'm always scared, It's affecting my health really badly and I just want it to end. Someone, anyone, please, help me.

894,Nervous to ask for an ESA,"So I took a teaching job 4 hours from home (which for me is pretty far.) My first semester, I was so busy with teaching and coaching one act I had no time nor energy to socialize. Once one act season ended, I have been slowly but surely trying to get out more. However the town I live in is extremely small, like 800 people, so there's hardly any sort of volunteer opportunities. I've tried reaching out to coworkers, but they are all married and/or with kids and busy. 

My landlady is extremely nice, but the Tennant before me  had a cat that torn the place to hell now there's a no pets policy. She did say I could have a reptile or bird and I did get a fish, but it's not the same. A repitle or bird would be too high maintenance for me to care for, a cat would probably be the best for me. I know that b/c of my ADHD and anxiety I could probably qualify for an ESA, but I feel like it wouldn't be fair to my landlady. She's very good to me, and I don't want to look like ""that person"". I do have an appointment to speak with a doctor here so on, but I just wanted to to get some other opinions as well. 

Do I try to find a new place to live that allows pets or do I try to go for getting an ESA?",3,2019-01-03 22:46:01 EST-0500

896,My coworker found out about my self-harm issues and it's making me nauseous,"Background:
Coworker A and me have been friendly since I work here (4 months) and he's occasionally flirty, but even Though I was anxious at first I just ignored his approaches.
So today I was talking to Coworker B who mentioned how surprised she is by my attitude, I always sounded so weird when CW A talked about me. Apparently A has been telling B a lot about me and, even though I don't know any details, most of it wasn't exactly nice.
CW B also told me that A texted her saying that he thinks I'm 'a cutter' and how that totally turned him off.
Especially this made me extremely anxious, I'm nauseous and dizzy and took the long way to my Office to avoid running into A.

I don't know why him being 'turned off' by my scars is so hard for me. I really, really don't want a relationship with A but I feel so abnormal and somehow freaky. To encounter how judgemental people are just scares me because how many others will think the same of me? I've made an effort not to let anyone at work know about my  mental health issues because of stuff like this.
The talking behind my back thing just worsens the situation.

I feel so shitty avoiding him And I know I should talk to him but just thinking about bringing the subject up makes me shaky.

Has anyone experienced something similar and has advice for situations like this?

905,Does anyone else lose their appetite when anxious?,"I‚Äôve been anxious since I was a kid. It‚Äôs been pretty consistent my whole life but in times of stress it gets considerably worse. 
I 
just graduated college, which was a massive accomplishment for me, but I have been very high stress the last couple of months due to the anxiety of starting my ‚Äúadult life‚Äù. Something that correlates with that is my loss of appetite to the point where all I can eat all day is one bagel, sometimes even less. Anything more and I either feel extremely nauseous or I start gagging when trying to eat. 

These last few months I have dropped quite a bit of weight and people keep commenting on it, telling me I look good. Which only makes me feel more anxious, mostly due to the fact that I know it‚Äôs an unhealthy consequence of my anxiety that I have no idea how to deal with.

Me- ""umm excuse me I'm sorry but there is a actually a line...""

Her-""yes I know, I'm in it""

Me- *hands shaking now* ""well actually that man and myself were Infront of you"" 

Her- "" umm I don't think you were actually in the line"" 

By this time I was freaking out and was just going to let her stay Infront of me but my need for those prawns was real.

Me- "" well I was and you should ask if your not sure instead of just standing Infront of someone...""

I've convinced myself that it's not normal at all.

Today, I was hiking in a canyon near my house, I've been there a few times before. From the start I was super on edge and afraid, I guess afraid that someone would kill me or that somebody would follow me, and pictures flashed of all the things you hear about in horror stories in my mind through the entire ride. I had to stop at one point because I was getting super hot, dizzy, and breathing extremely rapidly and was just so afraid that my body seemed to want to shut down. It didn't get better until I got to a point where I could see everything around me, at the top of a hill where it was clear out, and I started to calm down, but I obviously couldn't stay there forever because I had to go back. It was rough.

Every time I leave the house, 9/10 of the time when I leave the house and am going somewhere alone, whenever I get to the destination I'm **always** checking over my shoulder, looking around, listening for whispers or noises, trying to reassure myself that everything is okay yet it's not okay and it gets to the point where I just leave. I used to think that I wasn't afraid of anything tangible, and I don't know if this is a ""fear"" or something else, but it's bothering me so much.

I don't know where it stems from, but I know that it's not normal.

From things like walking a few blocks to get to the store, to photography at night or even at day in remote locations, today biking in the woods on a little dirt trail, going on drives alone and stopping to use the bathroom, hiking, or even just getting something from my car outside my house, I'm always checking over my shoulder, looking around me, listening for something off. I heard the sprinklers go off last night and jumped and ran inside because I was afraid, and I don't know why.

It's holding me back so much in life. I love exploring, especially alone. Abandoned places, forests, mountains and trails, cities- I just love exploring and being out in the world and seeing things. I just can't. One time I tried to go to an abandoned building, I started shaking and freaking out because of fear. I don't know why. I know it's not the smartest idea to do that anyways but I mean, I'm 17 years old, I want to live my life and have some fun, and make Youtube videos about it all.

I can't speak to a therapist about it because I can't speak to a therapist because insurance won't cover it anymore. I just had my last therapy session a few days ago because that was the last one we get for awhile. I don't want to tell anyone because I'm ashamed of it but then again, here I am on my main account opening up to everyone in the world. I don't know anymore. Does anyone  have any suggestions?

(it's a lot better when I'm not alone, but definitely not gone. Still always in the front of my mind, even in safe locations.)",2,2019-11-20 01:18:50 EST-0500
929,Mini Panic Attacks??,"Hey! first time posting here, just wanted to ask has anyone ever experienced mini panic attacks. I‚Äôve suffered with panic attacks since i was a teenager but they were usually big ones where i was sweating, hyperventilating all that good stuff. They seemed to have settled down but now i‚Äôve noticed i get small feelings of being overwhelmed and very anxious and just of terror but they go away in like 5-10 minutes where my usual panic attacks take ages to settle.

934,So anxious today I could barely move,"My anxiety is definitely genetic-based and it's just gotten progressively worse the older I get. I can remember having panic attacks when I was a little girl of single digit age. I don't have anywhere near as many panic attacks now at almost 29, but the constant underlying anxiety is so much worse. I cannot leave the house while unmedicated because I just have massive panic attacks cause my brain keeps telling me *something* bad is going to happen.

Anyway, I'm about a week and a half into being on Zoloft's generic for the first time at the lowest dose (I'm sensitive to meds and have had lots of problems with side effects in the past) and I thought it was going pretty well. Then today happened. I don't know why, but I have felt paralyzed with anxiety today for no reason. The only time I've really moved is to get up to go to the bathroom and occasionally drink some water so I don't trigger a migraine from being dehydrated or anything.

The only new ""stressor"" I can remotely think of is this writing exchange I'm in and the due date is in a few days. But even if a hobby I enjoy is giving me some stress, I have never been paralyzed with anxiety over a looming deadline like this. Idk if this is some kind of temporary adjustment issue with the zoloft or if I'm just having a REALLY off day or what's going on. I just wish it would stop. I do have an as needed ativan script that I could take, but I don't like relying on it too much since addiction runs in my family. iirc the last time I took one was last week so I'm probably okay to take one now and my anxiety is what's making me hesitant.

Idk. I just needed to vent. I haven't done anything today and it's still been an awful mhi day and that just REALLY sucks :/",0,2019-11-20 03:13:31 EST-0500

I feel like I can‚Äôt do anything right. I can‚Äôt accomplish anything. All I want is to not be able to be able to do normal things without worrying about it. I am so afraid of fucking things up that I just avoid doing things all together. Which I know isn‚Äôt the right way to handle anxiety but I just don‚Äôt know what else to do.

At first I tried to break a finger. I kept pushing my knuckle back in excruciating pain but I just couldnt go through with it.

So I took a knife and cut all my fingers on my left hand open. I started cutting them so I could show the band that I couldnt play because I cut my hand cooking.  In reality I sat in my room, slicing into the top pads of my four fingers. It bled more than I thought it would.

The next day I showed them my fingers. They seemed confused and really pissed that I didnt want to play.

When I first started working I had 4 hour days. One of the employees had a family emergency and had to move out of state. I‚Äôm very close with my Dad and hate seeing him worry so I thought I‚Äôd help him. I decided to fill in until someone else took the position. My dad works in construction and I‚Äôm a small female, so whenever I would talk to someone or answer the phone they would always ask to talk to someone else, or they would tell me I‚Äôm not experienced enough. For weeks I asked my Dad and manager everyday if anyone responded to the ad and they repeatedly told me no. 4 months into working customer service I finally told them I couldn‚Äôt take it anymore, they told me unless I wanted to work somewhere else I‚Äôd have to work customer service. They finally decided to tell me that they took the ad down the week I started working and had been lying to me the whole time. 7 months into working I had a anxiety attack because they worked me so hard. I went from 4 hour days to 8 hour days which was major for all my health issues. It‚Äôs now 8 months later I‚Äôm terrified to leave my house. I haven‚Äôt worked in a month and everyone‚Äôs mad at me for ditching them. 
Should I feel bad for leaving? I tried to advocate for myself, I would have done anything not to let my Dad down and I feel like I did.

But why did she start dating my friend?  The person she knew I confided in and gave me words of advice regarding her.  I'm glad she wants to be friends, but seeing them together brings me pain.  I never liked the idea of breaking off contact with someone but I can see why now people do.

And it's not a counter to my negative what if - I have to be in a certain mood for a good what if. And then I just daydream of the life where it's all better.

I didn't feel anything for his death for half a week until the Monday after finding out, I started feeling uncomfortable in class like I was about to cry. I was working on the homework my math teacher gave me and I didn't understand it (because I had a hard time focussing) so I was getting frustrated on top of me wanting to cry. I got out of the class room and started talking to her then I started crying about my cousin's funeral that was happening on Tuesday. So I asked my mom to pick me up. The next day I really didn't feel like going to school. I just got out of the shower and I had what I believe was a minor panic attack (never had one before) I texted my dad that I couldn't go to school and cry over the phone. I was supposed to go to school in the afternoon, bit when I talked to my dad I started to feel like I did in first period. It has calmed down since then, but I still have a feeling of not going to school and doing homework. I think I might be going through some short of mid-life crisis as a 15 year old (I know it's ridiculous). I feel like I have no control over my life and school is taking over, I haven't been doing my homework as much as I should be it hasn't affected much yet, but I know it will. In my last report card I had a 97% average in math and never had a test under 94% but today I got my test back and I got a 84%. I should be doing my math homework and it's 10:00 pm now. I tried to start it but I started to cry. I don't know why my motivation for school is completely gone.

979,First anxiety attack in front of boyfriend,"My boyfriend and I have been friends for nearly 2 years and have been dating for four months. Yesterday was the first time I had an anxiety attack in front of him. He has known that I have anxiety but he's never seen it first hand.

Well yesterday, I was hanging at his place anime on his computer when all of a sudden my anxiety overwhelmed me. I went to his bathroom for a minute hoping it would pass and then I broke down, I realized that I had been in the bathroom for too long so I quickly washed my face and went back out. Even though I had washed my face it couldn't hide the redness and puffiness of my face. 

At first he didn't see it because I was on my phone and hid my face with my hair, and then he laughed and pointed at the screen and looked over at me, immediately paused the show and went ""are you okay?""

That's when I pointed at my chest and through very narrow breaths said ""I'm.... having... an .... anxeity... attack""

He asked why, and when he realized I couldn't talk he grabbed my hand and rubbed methodical circles. 

Throughout the rest of the attack, if I told him not to touch me he'd lay off. If I told him to touch me he'd wrap me in an embrace. He even pointed at me and looked at our dog and said ""Mom's sad. Give her love"" to which our dog jumped on me and gave me dozens of kisses.

I just... aghast. I'm so happy he reacted the way he did. But in my head I thought he would have hated seeing my attack and would've reacted differently. I'm so happy he took it the way he did and I'm surprised as well. 

But goddamn I love that man.

&#x200B;

TL;DR I had an anxiety attack in front of my boyfriend and I thought he wouldn't reacted badly to it, but instead he held me if I needed it and backed off if I needed it and I really appreciated it",50,2019-07-19 22:44:53 EDT-0400
980,things anxiety has taken from me,"* Good memories - I struggle to remember the nice and the fun things. My personal highlight reel is all the times that I did something embarrassing, awkward or badly
* Ability to make decisions - I can't even plan my day without questioning everything. Should I do something more environmentally-friendly? Should I invite a friend, and would they even say yes? Do I have chores to do instead? Do I deserve this? 
* Ability to think clearly - I feel like I live in a fog of questioning everything and feeling sad and cut-off. I don't know what is normal any more. 
* Self-confidence - I went to Paris at 18 and China aged 20 where I didn't know anyone. This weekend I haven't been to the music festival at the end of my street because I think it will stress me out too much. 
* Zest for life - I used to plan the things I wanted to do and see, and I'd go travelling at every opportunity. Now I'd be quite happy if I could just get through the week without panicking and/or hating myself.

982,Overcame a panic attack on my own for the first time!,"Triggers: I talk about my panic attack 

I‚Äôm so happy I could cry! So there I was, at Starbucks, I had too much caffeine (which I shouldn‚Äôt truly be consuming to begin with) and I feel a panic attack coming on and coming on strong. 

Usually I try to shove it down. It never works but I still do it until I inevitably spiral.

But there was this barista sweeping by me. He and I had spoken a few times before this visit and I recalled him saying he was taking a summer course at the nearby community college.

I had my earphones in, trying to listen to music and shakily eat a bagel to calm down. I have social anxiety and have been trying to do some things to get over that these past few weeks such as, smiling when I make eye contact with people and attempting to have casual conversations. 

But there I was, debating whether or not I should even try casually talking to this guy in the midst of forcing back a panic attack and a strong urge to cry. After about a minute (maybe a few, not sure it felt like eternity though) I just turned my head to face him and did it! I asked him how his class was going and although I was very shaky (vocally and physically), we ended up having a great conversation. 

We briefly touched on my anxiety. I even lightheartedly made a joke about choosing whether to have a bagel or panic attack and I seriously don‚Äôt know how this didn‚Äôt kill the conversation. I wish I could remember what he said afterwards or how the conversation kept flowing. Somehow we ended up talking about a bunch of things. It wasn‚Äôt until the end of the conversation that I realized, my panic attack was gone. All the symptoms of my attack were gone as well (I don‚Äôt want to list them and trigger someone).

Not saying for people to try this at all, I‚Äôm just happy I overcame a panic attack and wanted to share this excitement with somebody. 


TLDR: ended up striking up a conversation with a barista when forcing back a panic attack and ended up overcoming it instead of spiraling for the first time!

Yesterday I spent the morning crying trying to leave my boyfriend's house but I was so anxious I kept coming up with excuses not too. I finally got out and I was proud of myself for not letting the anxiety get to me, I got my jobs done and then I found out finally that my bf and I got accepted into the flat we applied for! I was over the moon because I've been so worried that it might not go through and that I might not have anywhere to live next month. I then also had a job interview this morning and as I was travelling I really thought I was just gonna throw up from my anxiety and I thought about cancelling altogether, BUT I went through with the group interview, was outspoken and chatty (which I usually find so hard) I pushed myself outside my comfort zone and I didn't let anxiety win. Now I have a new flat and a new job which is so rewarding, and I'm over the moon!

I don't know how to solve these problems with my family.
Today my father told me that he feels like I didn't care about him at all until i moved out of my mother's house. I didn't know what to say because he might be right. It is sickening.

I always suffered from depression and everything and i always had problems with the lack of my social abilities.

I am a moody person and it is difficult for me to just be nice to people when i am in a bad mood.

Now i feel like i have no friends and no one i have a good connection to.

I mean i get that i am not nice to be around most of the time /when i feel bad, but it hurts me, and i am helpless here.

I don't know how to change this. I don't want to be the person everybody hates, and even I would doslike me if i had to be around me. I mean i can be fun, but especially in the last few months my character kind of changed and i feel like i am the worst person now.

I struggle to improve myself, to be there for others or be nice to them. Hell, I don't even have a mother who loves me. I don't know what to do. I feel numb but still bad.

I feel like everyone hates me and that i deserve it, and i am not really feeling like talking to others rught now because i fear being an asshole without getting it /getting why they don't dislike me.

1016,What's Next‚Ä¶ ?,"So you've now got a detailed journal about your depression, anxiety, anger and other feelings...you've written in detail about various events in your life that contributed to those emotions and are the root cause of your triggers. Now that you have this knowledge what's next? Nothing gets fixed by itself, nothing happens by accumulating knowledge on it's own...but rather, it's what you do with that knowledge.

Now this post is ONLY for sufferers of serious depression and anxiety, because you guys are the only ones who are going to have any hope of understanding what I'm talking about. Those with a semi normal upbringing, as you know, have no clue what it's like to be us because it so very far out of their realm of experience in life. (Gotta love them for trying though...)

Most of us would agree and readily acknowledge that the intensity of what we feel is due to multiple unhealed emotional traumas in our past... easy to say, but hard to realise the magnitude of the impact of that reality. You have, in your life many, many unresolved emotional wounds tightly suppressed in your subconscious. What does that even mean? It means that on a fundamental level your inner emotional and psychological harmony has suffered a serious fracture or fragmentation... especially when it comes to trauma in your childhood, such things as standing up for your thoughts, feelings, opinions and self worth were fractured by trauma...instead of being addressed and resolved, these things were considered by your subconscious as unimportant or even dangerous, compared to surviving the moment. That is why considering them now evokes intense feelings of danger in your subconscious...because your subconscious still believes that those lies are true. That is why we often become the emotional abusers of ourselves because that is what the trauma taught us to do to survive.

The next step is hard, because you have to do it when you feel bad...whether it's disproportionate anxiety, depression or anger or shame or anything else, when you feel the intense emotion, from now on let it be a signal for you that now you need to go to work on your subconscious... for now, we will call this work ‚Äúshadow work‚Äù. We are trying to find out things about ourselves in our subconscious that we didn't even know that we didn't know...things that are supressed...particularly unfinished emotional business that never came to an acceptable resolution. This involves what we will call ‚Äúself talk‚Äù.

The problem is that when we suffered trauma in our childhood we had lots of self talk that never came to an acceptable resolution...that's why they were suppressed because an acceptable resolution was simply not possible at the time. The kind of self talk we're talking about here is the kind you need when you feel your worst... instead of running away from the pain, denying it or supressing it, what I'm going to ask you to do is to go towards the pain, feel the fullness of it, sit with it a while and recognize where it comes from, how it originated...and now you need to imagine and pretend that you are talking to the child version of you that suffered that trauma... tell that child version of yourself what it needed to hear at the time, reassure it, love it, tell it that you're here for them and you won't let anything bad like that happen again. Tell them its ok to feel sad, scared or angry, spend as much time with this part of you as possible...this is where the healing and resolution starts to take place. Trust me, even for me, the first time is weird and confronting, but the more you try, the easier and more natural it gets...you might be surprised what you learn. In time try imagining what this child version might say to you in return... 

Learning these things taught me not to fear or hate my negative emotions, but to see them for what they really are... the supressed pain of an emotionally wounded child...that is not something anyone should run away from, deglect, deny, shame or hate... but it is a very vulnerable part of you that needs the tender love, care and reassurance that only you can give if you have the courage.

It usually works for a bit and then I have to do it again a few minutes later. I was not conscious that I did this until I moved to Korea and got scolded for doing this.

It borders on paranoia and is very overwhelming, I just constantly fear having made some sort of mistake/making someone mad and that nobody is telling me about it. It's a daily occurrence for me to have this thought process.

1036,TIFU by crying during a job interview,"I have been struggling to find a job for over a year. I've had a few jobs lined up, just to have them fall through right before I was finally able to get started. Needless to say, I had been stressing before this interview. 

I had been wanting to work at this place for as long as I can remember, being that I love video games and all things surrounding them as a whole. 

The man interviewing me and I were getting along great, even after he made me wait an hour for him to finish a conference call beforehand. I even helped a child pick a couple games to buy before the actual interview. (Probably should have mentioned that to him during the interview, in hindsight)

Anyway, I got flabbergasted and scatterbrained due to the fact that the man interviewing me kept asking me questions about sales and marketing. Then...I just broke down. 

My anxiety got the better of me and I told him how badly I have been trying to get a job, how close I've gotten only to have the proposed job slip through my fingers last minute.... How I'm nearing 30 and am still living with my parents, don't have a job, have crippling depression, anxiety, etc. Basically, spilled my guts to him... 
He wasn't very sympathetic but, in his defense, I was being interviewed and straight up lost my cool in the middle of it. 

Now, I'm terrified that I blew the opportunity just because my anxiety got the better of me.

TL ; DR: TIFU because my anxiety of not being able to get a job for the longest time led me to spill my guts and cry during an interview.

EDIT: Wow! I cannot thank you all enough for overwhelming support you've shown. I feel so much better than I did when I first posted this; I feel like I'm not so alone. Not so afraid. Thank you so much for your kind words and even the gold award someone gave me for being strong. I never ever have thought of myself as strong until someone mentioned it...still don't, most days, but I'm working on it. I'm keeping my fingers crossed and my head held high.

1039,Quick tips on what has reduced my anxiety and panic attacks GREATLY.,"Hi all, just wanted to share some tips I have recently been learning that have really helped my anxiety and OCD. 

1. Structure of schedule. For most people with anxiety, having a strict schedule and knowing what you are doing helps you feel more in control. I'm on summer break from college and recently started working full time and it doesnt allow me to be anxious. I'm occupied.

2. Be active. Whether that means working out and running, or just fishing and going out with friends, be active and get some sort of exercise. 

3. Avoid universal triggers. Too many screens. Laziness. Popular news media that always is reporting negatives. Avoid em. 

4. EAT HEALTHY!!! This one is so important. Having a diet that is very healthy helps tremendously. I've done whole plant based diets plus fish and chicken with organic and fresh produce and I've never felt more energetic and stress free before in my life. I highly reccomend looking into how diet affects mood and mental health. What goes in comes out

Also, never be ashamed or anxious about taking the medicine your doctor prescribed you.

Hope this helps and let me know of any of more tips you guys have!",20,2019-06-06 20:51:20 EDT-0400

1042,"I just went out on the streets and played my music (guitar, singing with a mic) in front of complete strangers.","I'm still kinda shaking from it, but man I've just come so far in the past few years dealing with Social Anxiety. 9 years ago I couldn't even go to the college library because I was too scared of what people thought of me. 

For some reason this was harder than going to an open mic since I felt like everyone who avoided eye contact or didn't give me a thumbs up was rejecting me. Over and over and over. I was definitely validation seeking, but I guess this is the next step to learn to stop caring all too much about what others think.

My heart rate goes up, I struggle to breathe, I zone out  a lot and feel tired ALL THE TIME. But recently, it‚Äôs gotten to the point that I will have a toilet break, not drink anything and need to go to the toilet just over an hour later, because I started to feel anxious about something.

In the past (as a kid) I was only mentally affected by anxiety, save knee bouncing, biting my pens and using childhood comforting habits. But I‚Äôm 15 now, doing my GCSE mocks (GCSEs are the first set of qualifications, which rely upon exams, that  British people get at school, and mocks are practice for the real exams). I don‚Äôt need to be going to the toilet halfway through a lesson or in between classes risking being late. I don‚Äôt need to feel like I can‚Äôt breathe when I‚Äôm in the middle of chemistry. I don‚Äôt need to be bouncing my knee when I‚Äôm exhausted and I‚Äôm supposed to be concentrating on something important.

I just want to find ways of dealing with the physical problems that come with anxiety.

1091,I'm tired of this 'thing' trying to take over me everytime I speak or do anything.,"OK, as you can tell, I have anxiety. This aaamaaazing thing makes me panic and I've been trying to work on it, for the sake of me, and for the sake of my friends and family. Almost everything I do in front of people makes me turn red, and I become 50% more wet and sweaty since I (probably) have hyperhidrosis. I've been doing some meditation and trying to step out of my comfort zone but it's extremely difficult.

 I absolutely hate it when someone just trys to tell me to breathe, and when I feel like I need a hug or something like that, I back off because I'm worried of becoming more awkward(haven't hugged my friends/family properly(working on it) since 3rd grade, where my life shifted as I moved across the country, 7th grade rn). I'm usually try to be a bit more social and I hate not talking to people, but I get scared about taking about anything outside of my opinions.

So, in this case, I've decided to start working on it and as a new years resolution, I'm working on my physical image a bit more when I can, being more open(just came out to my friends), hugging more, and now I have a comfort zone bucket list, which is hard to make with all the things a child can't do, I'm answering all the questions anyone asks me about, and trying my best to accept rejection.

Let's see if it works.",1,2019-12-21 06:48:03 EST-0500

1095,Breathlessness for days???,"I've been dealing with social GanxietyD for a long time but something new has popped up. Breathlessness. It feels like I am not getting enough oxygen and I start to try and breathe deeply only for it to be cut off. I have had my pulse/ox tested a few times during this and am always at 98-99% so I know I am not starving for air physiologically.  

Lung x-rays are clear and clean after quitting smoking 6 years ago. This has been popping up a few times every month and is getting unbearable.

Diazepam seems to stop this but with the current epidemic of people searching for ""feel good pills"" I can't get them when I need them, I get 15 and am asked to make them last 6 months or more. I have been put on cure all anti-depressants which just kill any feelings I have in general and am trying to avoid that because feeling out of breath, I guess is better than feeling nothing at all.

1098,Husband suffers from anxiety--trying to understand it better,"I'm trying to get a better understanding of what my husband goes through everyday. But I'm also trying to be smart about my boundaries and what I am willing to accept. I feel like we all suffer from anxiety to a certain degree, but his is worse than most. I thought I would come here to approach my understanding differently. 

His anxiety is not crippling. It doesn't affect his ability to hold a job. He does shy away from certain social situations. It really bothers him when he's commuting. If we are arguing, it often is unleashed on me in a verbally abusive way which is what I find hard to come to terms with. There have been some pretty awful instances over the years, which is why I have a hard time saying his verbal abuse is a link to his anxiety. Does anyone else have any experience with this? 

I'm a firm believer that we are all responsible for our own reactions. He later says he didn't mean the things he says, but it doesn't change the fact that he still says them. He says his anger is a direct link to his anxiety. About a month ago he said something that broke the camels back, and I told him that I wanted us to start back up with couples therapy every other week and then in the off week we are each in individual therapy for a minimum of 4 months and then we can reevaluate the situation. He wants to move to shorten his commute, to get more space and so he can get a dog (currently small apartment, no room for one) all ways to lower his baseline anxiety. I don't want to move/buy a house/start having kids when I'm this uncertain about us and I don't feel safe enough with him to take these next steps in our marriage.

Advice?,"When I go to work everyday I just feel like I'm not good enough and not living up to expectations. I get the feeling that my manger doesn't like me and thinks I'm stupid, and I don't know if it's in my head or not. Whenever I raise a point or ask a question I feel that people just look at me as if I'm stupid before answering.  I feel like people use a different tone of voice when explaining things to me.  
I just keep thinking that I'm not good enough and not living up to expectations.  I was recommended for this job and given extremely high praise which played a part in me getting it, but I can't help thinking that I've turned out to be a disappointment and haven't been living up to that praise.  I know I'm not terrible.  But I make small mistakes and I forget to do things sometimes and I shouldn't be, because I hav pe enough experience to not me making mistakes.  

I struggle with thoughts if my manager not liking me the most and because of this find it quite awkward to make conversation and be in the same room alone, which I'm sure doesn't help her feelings about me.  My previous job I worked under someone who was very hard on me to the point of bullying and I seem to be transferring my fears about that person to my current manager.

1106,My 20 yr old sister is afraid to sleep alone..,"My twin and I have always been close but I would say that I am more independent than her. For as long as I can remember, she's always been in a scared state. I remember as kids we used to walk home from our elementary school which was only a block away and if she saw a grown up on the other side of the street or walking our way she'd drop all that she had and run home into our house. Then around the age of 11 she began to have a sudden fear of our dad who is probably the most charismatic person in our household, he jokes around a lot and there would be no reason for her to be scared but she was. Whenever my dad found a new route to go home she would freak out thinking that he would take us somewhere and murder us, and multiple times throughout the night she would wake me up because she was scared and thought she ""heard"" something breathing under our bed. 

I obviously tried to be brave and although I knew this was all in her head her worries always made me think if the worst things happening. Because of her scared state of mind, we have always had to share a bed and room. And we always slept with the hallway light on. If I ever got up to use the restroom at the middle of the night she would run to the switch and turn it on. We're 20 now and in college. We spent our first 2 years in the dorm and now we live in an apartment but still, she continues to sleep in my bed. It's a twin bed so it can be uncomfortable at times. And to top it off she still wakes me up multiple times to ask if I heard something or to tell me she had a bad dream. Sometimes on the nights where shes really scared she asks me to hold her hand or even hug her. 

&#x200B;

If I'm being honest I don't mind that I have to be there for her but sometimes I just want to sleep peacefully. And we've talked about how her doing this is selfish but she really doesn't care and continues to have this scared state of mind. I don't know why she's scared and don't know how she would resolve this issue.",6,2019-02-08 01:33:27 EST-0500
1107,Help setting boundaries with Mum to help cut the umbilical cord,"This is a bit of a repost.   


 

I 'moved out' in the past few months from my dad's, but I now live in a flat on the same floor as my mum (the property happened to be going and Mum mentioned it.) My mum is trying to treat it as if we are living together as much as possible, making excuses to come in and see me be that to do my washing, bring in a meal or invite me over to hers or out for lunch.

I have a very hard time saying No to her. If I have a plan for the day and she invites me to do something then I feel anxious saying No and sticking to my plan. I feel compelled to be abandon my plan so as not to upset her, I feel I have to justify the plan as work or something jobs related. I know that it is acceptable to be unavailable because I'm seeing friends but not acceptable to be planning to go to the gym.

My anxiety about saying no to her is partly because Mum would stonewall me and refuse to help me as a teenager if I challenged her. The other is that I worried her by being very depressed and having an eating disorder during my young adulthood years. Since we both got therapy for an anxiety disorder she's been super-compensating for that, plus it is in her disposition to be anxious anyway.

The last time I talked about 'boundaries' and 'independence' to her she told me to ""stop talking like that, you sound like your dad"" and we fell out without her explaining it. I then felt a need to get her a thank you present for helping me around the flat and basically dropped the issue of having space altogether just to keep the peace.

I'm honestly not used to having to invest so much time in a parent, my dad was pretty chill about when he saw me or not. I also get frustrated because my brother gets away with only calling home 6 weeks whereas I have to check in every 24 hours and see them every week (especially Mum, and ideally twice or more.)

I get off when I think I'm feeling better and can manage life without it but then I get back on cause I realize I need them again.  I recently weaned my way off about 4 months ago and was feeling good but then all of the negative thoughts slowly kept coming back to me and I decided I wanted to get back on ssri's again.  I got my old bottle of sertraline and only took 25mg of one.  I was out later that night at a family event and ended up having the worst anxiety attack in the bathroom that I've had for a long time.  Couldn't think, couldn't concentrate, just felt empty and the days after I had the same feeling.  I work at a restaurant so I need to be able to at least pretend to be happy with the customers but I couldn't even do that.  I had a full bledged panic attack on the way home from work a few days ago where I was hyperventilating and crying and couldn't stop for a good 30 minutes.  Went and saw the doctor today and she recommended me to a psychiatrist.  Has anyone else had an experience like this with getting back into an ssri?  ",1,2019-02-08 02:42:20 EST-0500

I know to myself that it isn't true but when I get confronted with something my anxiety soars and it mimics what a horrible liar's reaction would be: flushed face, stammering, can't hold eye contact, etc. making me look guilty.

I don't tend to post here but I really wanted to tell someone that would not be disgusted by me. 

I have been deep in depression and anxiety for about 6 months. I went to the dentist in May due to an emergency. The dentist explained to me that I have beautiful teeth that just need some TLC after not brushing them for years. I remembered that about a year ago in Aug 2018, a friend gave a company-wide training on dental health. She urged everyone that electric toothbrushes are the best way to clean up dental health quickly.

With all this information in mind, I've been saving up money to go out and buy a Sonicare toothbrush with a gentle whitening toothpaste formula. Today, I finally did it. I bought everything I needed. I brushed my teeth for the first time in months. I have no more plaque buildup. I set an Alarmy reminder twice a day to go take a picture of a bar code on my bathroom mirror so I remember to brush my teeth.

So, if you‚Äôre anything like me, I would get anxious about being in places that made me uncomfortable. Restaurants, bars, crowded friends houses, small cars, even the family dinner table. When I would arrive at one of these scenarios, I felt like I was stuck. I said hello to everybody, they all know I‚Äôm here. Now I‚Äôm obligated to stay here and continue interacting and showing my face. I would ESPECIALLY feel stuck out at a restaurant, as soon as we sat down. It was like, ‚Äúwell.. we sat down at the table. Now I have to sit here through appetizers, entrees, maybe even dessert before I can get up again.‚Äù It‚Äôs kind of like needing to use the bathroom in the middle of a movie theater after the movie started, and now you feel trapped. Either cause a mini ‚Äúall eyes on me‚Äù scene, or sit there with your nerves. 

So, here‚Äôs what I started doing: 5 minutes into whatever I was doing, wherever I was - I walked away. Walk in, say hello to everybody, even sit down at a table in a restaurant - give it about 5 mins, and walk away. Go outside. Leave the environment you had just entered. This is an almost immediate reminder that you can ALWAYS walk out, away from whatever may be making you anxious, and that you are not in fact ‚Äústuck.‚Äù Even if you‚Äôre driving or riding as a passenger in a car for a duration of any length - if you feel on edge about it, split the trip up. Drive half way there, stop at a store and grab a cold drink or even a snack. Give yourself a few minutes outside of the car to stretch your legs and remind yourself that you can step out into freedom at any time. Nearly every time, this has made me more confident once I get back in the car. I noticed it while running errands. I was really anxious about going to the first store, and after finishing that errand, the rest seemed much less daunting. 

This might sound so simple or stupid, especially to those of you who haven‚Äôt experienced this, but it helps. I‚Äôve probably walked out of restaurants and bars 4 or 5 times in the span of a couple hours on rough days. For the most part, the people I‚Äôm close to already know why I‚Äôm doing this, and think nothing of it. 

Hopefully this will help some of you like it helped me. Have a nice day friends.",48,2019-08-21 15:47:25 EDT-0400

It could literally be me commenting something extremely positive or congratulating someone on an accomplishment that I‚Äôm sure the receiver would be thankful to hear, but my brain instantly convinces myself that what I have to say adds zero value to the conversation and that nobody cares about my opinion.

I know realistically not everybody is going to care about what I have to say, which is completely okay, but I‚Äôm try to convince my brain that there are people who do value my opinions and what I have to add to the conversation.

My therapist even said some of the things I said we're ridiculous!

I feel forever changed. My relationship has never felt more stable, and we are about to make a year. Managing study time has never been easier. Before it was either anxiety not letting me study, or my ADD. Now, I just worry about ADD :P

I am so happy. Sometimes I feel like crying because of how much more stable I am. I feel *normal.* I still need to work on the shame about taking medication, but quite frankly, after being in therapy for at least 4 years straight, attempts to improve myself, nothing has worked, but Lexapro has.

1167,Professor called me out/kicked me out for looking like I wasn't listening,"I've been having a very hard week for a number of reasons, and my prof's behaviour certainly didn't help.

First, she loudly tapped on my desk and asked me (rhetorically) what was wrong and whether  I was ""just pretending to be a student"" (the topic of her complaints during that class). When my appearance didn't improve after a few minutes, she said, loudly, ""Why don't you just leave if you're going to sit there and do nothing?"" 

At first, I sheepishly said I'd rather stay and that I *was* participating, but I felt like I might get called out again so I decided to leave a minute later.

Teachers/professors: if you notice a student who looks like they're having a hard day, don't do things to make it worse. Either ask them if there is anything you can do (after class, in private) or just do nothing.",20,2019-10-10 21:04:39 EDT-0400
1168,"After working from home for the last 7 years (due to social anxiety), I finally landed my first job in the outside world!","Hey guys, I wanted to share my story ‚Äî not to brag or boast, but to offer a bit of hope for anyone else who might be in a similar situation.

So for the last 7 years I‚Äôve worked from home as a freelance writer, mainly covering music. It allowed me to work at my own pace, in my own comfort zone, and not have to deal with day-to-day situations that triggered my social anxiety (save for the occasional interview or gig, which always turned me into a nervous, overly-self-conscious mess).

Dream job, right? 

However, last summer I found myself desperately unhappy. Like, crying-while-making-breakfast unhappy. I realised that as much as working from home sheltered me from anxious situations, I‚Äôd actually been hiding away from the world, from people/relationships, and from the chance to grow into the person I want to be (not to mention the opportunity to make a decent living lol).

As ‚Äúcool‚Äù as being a music journalist may have sounded to some people, the reality was that I was living a lonely, unhappy and unhealthy existence. Something needed to change. 

It took me over a year to work up the courage, but last month I finally applied for new writing jobs. Even reading through the job descriptions filled me with anxiety and dread. *Must be able to work to tight deadlines under pressure. ""*Ohhhh fuck üò∞,"" I thought. But I was determined to fight through it.

Last week I got my first interview for a copywriting job at a digital marketing agency. My first real job interview *ever*. My heart was pounding out of my chest from the minute I woke up to when I arrived at the office. I was absolutely terrified of blushing during the interview, stumbling over my words and the manager noticing I was clearly not a confident or capable candidate. It‚Äôs the most nervous I‚Äôve been in a long time. 

Somehow, I managed to get through the interview (which lasted 1 hour and 30 mins!) and make a good impression. A *really* good impression, in fact. The manager called me yesterday and offered me the job! üòÅ

He liked that I even remembered peoples' names, which I generally make an effort to do, if only to avoid looking like a forgetful clutz. I guess anxiety *can* be a good thing!

I start the job next month and I‚Äôm already super nervous, but I‚Äôm also really proud of myself. A few years ago I would be too anxious to even Google ‚Äújob search‚Äù for fear of being taken out of my comfort zone. These last few weeks I've learned that that fear *is* conquerable, these fears are mostly a fabrication of anxiety anyway, and there are far better emotions and feelings to be found beyond that fear. Life is too short to live miserably in the shadows.

I don‚Äôt think I would‚Äôve had the courage to make this change if it wasn‚Äôt for a few things: 

&#x200B;

* Meditation. I like to use the [Calm app](https://www.calm.com/), which has a whole range of emotion-specific sessions and series (calming anxiety, boosting self-esteem etc). The one about confronting difficult emotions was especially helpful on those days I *really* didn‚Äôt want to think about job hunting.
* Mood board. Make a photo album of things that make you happy ‚Äî people, places, possessions, memories, movies etc. I‚Äôm most anxious in the morning, so looking through my mood board (while listening to feel-good songs) every morning really helped to lift my mood and confidence to start the day.
* Make a list. Write down things you‚Äôve done in the past that you‚Äôre proud of, things you‚Äôve achieved, challenges you‚Äôve overcome, no matter how silly or small. Remind yourself that you *can* be confident, you *are* capable, and you *do* have value. 
* Find inspirational people. For me, learning that Bill Hader (the super funny and seemingly self-assured actor/comedian/director) has struggled with anxiety all his life ‚Äî to the point where he‚Äôd get physically ill in the days leading up to *SNL* ‚Äî but has still been able to find success in life, is totally inspiring, in a weird way. If you do one thing today, watch [this video of him talking about his anxiety](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6hsP7co3ZA).
* [Owning It: The Anxiety Podcast](https://podcasts.apple.com/ie/podcast/owning-it-the-anxiety-podcast/id1449728710). A super insightful, relatable and inspiring podcast on all things anxiety, hosted by Irish author Caroline Foran. I only discovered it a few weeks ago, but it has already given me so much useful information on how to manage and overcome anxiety.

It‚Äôs a hole I‚Äôve fallen down many times before and always found my way out eventually, but it‚Äôs like each time I think ‚Äòthis is the one time I won‚Äôt beat it‚Äô.

What I did that helped me out of bed today was decide I would do ONE SMALL THING only. Which was to walk 10 mins to the shop to buy oranges. It took me hours to make myself go, but I did, and I felt better for it. I was overwhelmed with all the things I SHOULD be doing and couldn‚Äôt start anything, but decided to be kind to myself and say that just doing that small thing was enough. I‚Äôm back at home and don‚Äôt want to go out again and will probably get into bed again and I still feel awful. But I have oranges now.

From what I‚Äôve read, it‚Äôs a positive feedback loop, doing one tiny thing gives you a dopamine boost, which is the motivation neurotransmitter, this then makes you feel more able to do another small thing, and so you build up and eventually hopefully can do more. But all at your own pace, with compassion for yourself when you need to take a break.",89,2019-05-11 16:55:58 EDT-0400
1183,Saw someone else post this recently but I got a job ‚ò∫Ô∏è I‚Äôm so happy. I just listened to everything my gf said and slowly figured everything out. She is a blessing. You can do it!!!!!!,"All I did was make a profile on the indeed app(yea I sound like a shill but fr) and applied to 7 jobs in seconds this morning. This afternoon got a call from one of them and went in for an interview.  I decided to just be myself and not worry about the interview, to treat them like a friend. They have something to gain from me and I have something to gain from them? Thats how I went into it and it worked ‚ò∫Ô∏è I‚Äôm so proud.  Omg.  Sorry.  I know I‚Äôm not special. But I had such a massive panic attack last night I thought I would never pull out of it. Today is so different ‚ò∫Ô∏è

1184,Increased anxiety/ruminating thoughts when your life isn't as busy?,"Does anyone else have increased anxiety, especially ruminating thoughts, when you're not ""busy"" with life and have too much time on your hands? How do you deal with this? I've been seeing a therapist lately and through our discussions about my anxiety she has pointed out that it seems like my anxiety is at its worst when I'm not busy at work, not busy dating people or seeing friends, no extracurricular activities etc.

I used to love the idea of staying home and relaxing but not anymore.",89,2019-05-10 17:19:54 EDT-0400

1188,"I have noticed that there are 4 words you can say to someone that can really brighten your day. Recently, someone said those to me, and it actually meant a lot.","So for everyone who has anxiety or faced bullying in the past - including me - I just want to say this:
I am your friend. 
It makes me happy knowing I am not lonely, and for someone to just blankly point out that they ate my friend. It makes me happy, and I do mean it for everyone else on this subreddit.

1189,I just found something amazing for sleep anxiety,A 20 pound blanket. Yup. Today was my first time hearing about it and my friend has one that I tried today. It‚Äôs like a constant hugging comfort. I‚Äôm not focused on anything really I‚Äôm breathing slow and calm and just feel overall nice. After about like 10-15 minutes wearing it I was about to fall asleep and I never sleep! Would totally recommend for anyone such as myself with anxiety at night.,75,2019-05-13 05:02:10 EDT-0400

1191,"My mom finally passed away from her stroke she had about two weeks ago. It‚Äôs like a living nightmare, needing a little help.","Hi everyone I was here about two weeks back my moms went into the ER with a stroke. She was in the ICU for about a week and a half and I was holding on to see if she would pull through. Unfortunately looking at all her brain scans her left side of her brain was completely lost , if I wanted to keep her here she would be fitted with a trake and a feeding tube and remain in a vegetative state . So I made the choice on my own because I have no siblings and took her off life support . She was with me one more week and that was it , she‚Äôs gone . I‚Äôve already made funeral arrangements for her and now I‚Äôm just waiting for her funeral . I feel so dissociated from myself , I can really feel my depersonalization getting deeper . I‚Äôm really having a hard time , my mom was my everything growing up and as I got older she and I lived separately . It kills me inside that the night  she had the stroke her roommate wasn‚Äôt there . And I had just got off the phone with her at around 11pm doctors suspect that she had begun her stroke possibly around 12 or 3 am and she was on the ground alone for 8 hours . I wish I was there I wish I could have saved her but I was not there . I‚Äôm just so hurt right now and confused, I don‚Äôt even know how to feel right now .",77,2019-05-10 09:31:57 EDT-0400

1194,Am I the only one who needs a job but is afraid to apply for one just in case I actually get the job?,"I know it sound weird but I stress about the fact that I don't have a job. I stress because I can't find a job to apply to. I stress cause I found a job to apply to and now I have to fix my resume. I stress cause ""omg what if I don't get the job"". And then I stress cause ""omg what if I do get the job""'

I hate the thought of getting up every day to 've to a job where anything can happen at any moment. And I mean even something simple like a boss asking you to make a phone call or to fetch them some paper. 

I hate when I'm not the one who plans my next moves and I have to be on my toes just in case someone asks me to do a simple task.

I consider myself to be quite intelligent and I turn into an absolute idiot when someone asks me to do something out of the blue. I literally freeze and my brain shuts down and I just knowww that would happen in a work environment. 

So I've been googling jobs for like the past 7 months that would minimize human contact I guess and I even stress about getting those jobs (Not that I have to worry cause I've literally gotten only one of them and I ended up flaking on the employer cause I got so nervous about doing the job)

Honestly. I'm tired of this. I want it to stop.",20,2019-05-14 03:50:26 EDT-0400
