3,Does anyone else have the sensation that they can't catch a proper breath?,"This might sound weird, but the last couple of days I've been pretty anxious. Nauseous, high heart rate, palms sweaty, mind racing, the whole 9 yards. Every once in a while I'll get this sensation that when I breathe in, it's not doing anything. It's like I took an empty breath. I know I'm breathing fine because I'm still functioning and not turning blue, but I just feel like I'm not taking a normal breath. It's really odd to describe, but does anyone else have something similar? ",28,2012-07-09 01:15:00 EDT-0400

6,How many of you suffer from actual physical pain as a direct result of anxiety?,"I say this because this is pretty much the main symptom of my anxiety anymore.  Just really random pains, pretty much anywhere.  It varies I guess, and it's starting to make me worry whether I'll overlook some something serious because I assume it's just anxiety (which probably causes even more anxiety haha).  How many others have this as well?",93,2012-07-14 21:22:15 EDT-0400
7,I just noticed something. I feel guilt when guilt is not warranted and is totally illogical (involving authority). (examples inside),"Let's say that someone comes in the room and announces ""I know that someone in this office has been stealing all the paperclips! If it's not you then you have nothing to worry about!"".

After that I will feel really afraid and guilty for a while even though I never even thought about stealing the paperclips and had nothing to do with it. I haven't done anything wrong, but my brain gives me guilt like I just punched a baby in front of the queen. What the heck is this?

It's been happening as long as I can remember. When I was in elementary school and we weren't supposed to talk and an adult said ""I heard someone talking! Who was it? Admit it or the whole class doesn't get recess!"" I would get terrified. Of course, the kid who was actually breaking the rules would never give himself up. There were a few times where I lied and gave myself up because I couldn't take sitting in class for those several tense minutes while the teacher waited to see if the real perpetrator would come forward. It was easier just to end it than to wait and be afraid that someone was secretly mad at me for something I didn't do. (I'm pretty sure the teachers knew because they would always give me a weird look since I never talked even when it was allowed, but they couldn't just let me ""get away with it"" since I had just ""turned myself in"")

I don't falsely admit to wrongdoing anymore, but I still hate the ""Someone is screwing up and *it might be you*!""",21,2012-07-12 04:43:42 EDT-0400

9,[Rant] Why can't I go back to the way I was before?,"Just four years ago I was so happy and carefree.

I had occasional stress and all that kind of stuff you get with life…but I was always able to shake it off.

Then I developed an anxiety disorder out of NOWHERE shortly after starting university.

Now I'm so fearful and anxious, every day. Some times are better than others, but it's always lurking in the background.

What could have changed? I wish I could go back to the way I was…why do I have to suffer this and will I ever get better?",4,2012-07-08 20:24:38 EDT-0400

11,Anyone out there dealing with Anxiety Medication Free?,"I've been having some serious work related anxiety attacks these past few months to the point where I even had to take 3 sick days. I had horrible nausea lack of appetite and loss of sleep. It may be a strange thing but I don't want to take any type of medication because frankly I wouldn't even remember to take it daily. 
Anyway, is there anyone out there who is doing the same thing? If so are there any helpful tips that's gotten you through a tough anxiety attack?







Edit: 

I spoke with my doctor about dealing with anxiety with out medication. He said it was a brave choice that he didn't recommend considering I had a history of depression. (I didn't even know I did!!) I am now in therapy and apparently have a problem with anger management. (guess I'm all messed up now...) I still have not taken any medication as I am stubborn. About 80% of the time I'm alright. Through therapy I've been able to gather that I get the majority of my attacks when I am 'in trouble' (like my boss says ""I need to see you"" And it doesn't even need to be bad. It's just that sentence that freaks me out) and when I'm timed on a run. And all of my anger issues point toward the stupidity I have to deal with at work. As far as my depression, I guess it's caused by an incident where I was sexually assaulted 4 years ago. I haven't thought much of it since then but I guess it's suppressed emotions there. 
Luckily my better half has been a great 'help' (he says he does nothing but him being there during a break down is more than enough) I also read how everyone on this subreddit is so supportive and it puts me in a calmer mood. (and lowers my heart rate)
This is a long journey that I am just now getting to know and I want to thank all of you who commented (and those who will in the future maybe?) for your great and wonderful ideas that I will definitely take into account while I'm going through this. Thanks and keep your chin up and so will I! <3",51,2012-07-08 03:59:54 EDT-0400

-------

I wanted to post this in /r/getmotiviated but I didn't think I'd get any comments. I just want a few replies.

**Edit: took a few things out to make personal details less specific**

I'm a 20 year old female and I'm scared of everything. I don't think I ever used to be like this - I took part in school sports day until I permanently damaged my ankle and was banned from entering, I used to pick up caterpillars,  butterflies, spiders, and all sorts without caring, I climbed through hedges and fences to find new things and new places without any fear, I did performances at drama club, I let everyone know my opinion and I wasn't offended if they disagreed, and I was a massive tomboy who spent a lot of time on the internet but had a healthy mix of hanging about outside too.


Then I started high school, a same-sex high school, and I completely withdrew into msyelf. I did not get on well with the other girls. Went into a massive ""emo"" phase as you do when you're 15 and the world is against you. Not like that any more obviously but years later and now:

* I can't get on a plane (this is a serious phobia affecting my life - to ""tackle it"" I took a short 50min each way round trip to London that was booked for me without my knowledge, preparing with 5 x 2mg diazepam tablets over the course of 12 hours and it did nothing to me, I took more to see why they weren't working, I thought I was genuinely going to die the entire flight and I cannot relive that experience without being sedated ever again, 50 minutes of thinking you are in absolute peril is hell)


* I'm too frightened to drive my car in case I come across a hill (I will literally have a panic attack if I stall, so I just don't drive - it's not just for my safety but for other road users'). It took me different instructors (the first one was a pervert, the second one told me to give up, and I later found out the third guy occasionally helped teach ""challenged"" people to drive, it took that much :|) and 50+ lessons to finally take my test and I passed first time, but it doesn't help my parents won't even let me practice. They are much more anxious than I am and I think I've wound up with some genetic anxiety predisposition.


* I find sleeping alone very difficult and I cannot sleep in a house by myself. I moved out with two housemates who did not stay frequently at all and I could not stay on my own.


* I always need to have someone by my side when I take a new medication in case I go into some sort of anaphylactic shock.


* I can't do cardio at the gym because my heart beating too quickly scares me and I've read too much about SADS recently


* I hate trains and buses because I don't know who the driver is and they don't have toilets and I can't get off them when I want. A few months ago I decided to take a train journey for the first time in five years and it was hijacked by a man with a gun. I want to go on a rail-journey with my boyfriend soon but this is scary.


* I just read a comment about a bone I didn't even know existed being susceptible to horrible spinal injuries - that made me have a panic attack and I'm still in tears over it.



* I didn't take birth control for years when I was seriously recommended it for severe menstrual cramps and anaemia, because I'd read somewhere it gives you blood clots, which made my school attendance drop to 70-80%.


* I currently have a lower-back injury which I need an MRI scan for but I'm refusing because I'm too scared. I also had recurring tonsillitis for 3 years because I refused to have the operation to get them removed, because I'm too scared.


* Only in the past few months, for the first time in my life ever, have I been able to swallow non-soluble painkillers/anti-biotics with the help of my boyfriend who has convinced me I'm not going to choke.


I'm probably a massive hypochondriac but I think it's a fear of dying more than anything. On the flip side, I'm too scared to even blog any more in case someone doesn't like what I've written and makes fun of me, so it's not all health related.


Despite all this I have more friends than I've ever had in my whole life (since starting university) who think these are just funny typical quirks of mine (""haha, never getting on a train with you again, that was hilarious"") and don't realise just how shit I feel about being so pathetic, I've near-perfect grades (won scholarships and came top in the class etc.), and I've met the actual love of my life (poor boy) so, what's there to be worried about? Exactly, I don't fucking know! And here's me freaking out over getting a fucking bus, getting steadily steadily worse. He'd probably be quite sad if he saw me talking about myself like this.


What the fuck is wrong with me? How do I stop my fears from ruining my own life? I miss being 13 and not giving a fuck. It's like puberty and school kicked in and destroyed my adventurous spirit. I've had cognitive behavioural therapy for the flying thing, which the therapist ended early because he thought I was alright, when really I felt like I'd ""caught on"" to what the therapy was trying to do and it didn't work. 


I've never officially been diagnosed with anything but I'm sure it would be some sort of OCD (I have fucking stupid rituals) with a delicious anxiety disorder mixed in. I honestly don't want to be like this - I just can't help it. I feel like my brain is too logical and I'm ""above not caring about things going wrong"", it analyses statistics too much and has become obsessed with avoiding risk. FML.


My aim is to be able to say fuck it, seize the day, and be NORMAL. And don't bullshit me with the whole ""aw people are different, no-one is truly normal"" You know what I mean. I want to stop being like this.


**tldr; i'm too scared to do a lot of normal activities if there's even a minute risk of something going wrong involved. I feel like my brain is too logical and I'm ""above not caring about things going wrong"", it analyses statistics too much and has become obsessed with avoiding risk. FML. have lovely boyfriend and don't want to scare him off as he's the only thing keeping me sane.**",31,2012-07-12 09:10:44 EDT-0400
13,[Help] I think I'm a Cyberchondriac/Hypochondriac.,"I'm really embarrassed about coming out and saying this, but I think I'm a hypochondriac. 

Every time I have a minor illness or symptom I start jumping to conclusions and start googling it. Soon after I pretty much convince myself that I'm going to die. 

For example, a few days ago I noticed a small lymph node in my neck that was slightly swollen, likely due to allergies or a mild virus going around, and after some googling I was convinced I had lymphoma, almost getitng ready to schedule a doctor's appointment. Then I did some more googling and I started thinking it was the West Nile virus from sitting outside on the patio recently. Then I got into a really bad thought loop.

I swear I'm not crazy, in fact I'm a completely normal person in all other aspects, but this is really wearing me down. Every time something minor happens I have this compulsion to google it, or else I constantly worry about having a deadly disease that I might not have known about.

How can I get over this myself and stop making myself sick with worry?",13,2012-07-08 07:31:33 EDT-0400

17,"Taking the beginning steps in coping with lifelong anxiety, and would love some perspective/advice from those who have been through it, as well as first hand experience with taking SSRI's","Alright, so I've reached a very stressful and scary time in my life and I'm not sure where else to turn to right now. 

I've had anxiety issues since I was about in the 2nd grade, but basically have dismissed them my whole life because I had believed them to be normal. My anxiety had built itself up so badly that around high school I started having suicidal thoughts as a result of how trapped I had been feeling. The first two years of college these thoughts began increasing more and more and my anxiety has been controlling every move, and I believed it to be completely normal. I have a really great life, with a supportive family and great boyfriend and I get good grades and I participate in lots of activities I love, so I really thought my feelings were normal, because in reality, there's no reason for me to feel the way I do.

Then, this summer, I kinda hit rock bottom. I was supposed to spend 3 weeks working at a summer camp that I LOVE. I had been a camper at this camp starting in the 5th grade and went up through their programs until my Junior year of high school, where I went on a month long backpacking trip in the Rockies. This camp has done SO much for me. I worked there last summer, leading canoe trips for little kids and I loved it too. But this summer, I just couldn't handle it. I was filled with dread about every situation and the few weeks upcoming my leaving for camp, I was crying every day, not sleeping, etc. The few days before I left, I started having regular breakdowns and panic attacks, and finally confessed to my parents the suicidal thoughts I was feeling. However, they pushed me to go. The first few days there were absolute hell, and I made it through 2 days of training with suicide running through my mind at all times and panic attacks keeping me up at night. My parents and I and my bosses decided that this was not a good place for me to learn coping mechanisms, so I went home. This was two days ago.

Now, I'm home and yesterday I went to go see a therapist who diagnosed me with severe anxiety and depression. While talking to her, a bunch of issues kind of came to light and I realized it's not normal to feel the way I feel. It's not normal to feel trapped in life and it's not normal to let anxiety fill me with dread about things like hanging out with my friends.
However, the therapist has recommended me to another doctor who she wants to prescribe me an SSRI. I am really wary about going on meds, because I'm a nursing student so I've basically seen/learned about every terrible thing that can go wrong while taking every kind of antidepressant. I also don't want to become dependent, don't want to change any part of myself, and feel as if it's an easy way out. But I do recognize that there's some serious chemical issues going on inside me, and that's the way to fix it.

The problem is that I've got about 2 weeks until I can meet with this doctor, so I'm just waiting around for 2 weeks filled with shame and guilt for leaving my camp job. I'm so embarrassed that I wasn't strong enough to work at a place I love and a place I even worked last year. I feel like I've failed myself and I feel wrong trying to make myself happy when I'm hiding at home when I gave up my responsibilities at camp. 

Sorry for this being long and rambling. I just needed to get that out because I don't really know where else to go.

My first question is if anyone is on/has taken an SSRI, I would really like to hear their experiences with it. I'm really afraid to take them, also afraid of the side effects. I don't want to gain weight or kill my sex drive, and I don't want the anticolinergic effects of the drug to make me more anxious. 

Also, I just want some perspective and advice. I completely hit my worst point the other day with having to leave camp and my anxiety basically snowballed to the point where I couldn't take it anymore. I don't really know where to go from here and how to get back in my normal life. I'm scared to see my friends and scared to leave my house because I don't want anyone to think less of me. I know I need to get past this otherwise I'll just keep spiraling downwards. Today I'm going to go to a bookstore and find some books to help through this, but if there's any real life tips, I'd love to know.

Sorry for how long this was :/

18,[Rant] Seriously?,"It's been years since I've seen you and we used to be best friends. I met you on the playground and you said no to letting me play tag with you and yet we still became friends. 

You used to come over my house to play video games and I used to go to your house to watch anime. I went to your birthday parties and I bought you Christmas presents every year even if you used to never return the favor. 

We used to talk every day on the phone to the point your mom didn't even ask who was calling. She just knew. I called you when I needed a friend to listen, to hear me out. I never called anyone else when my parents fought or when my dad was drunk. I called you because I felt safer talking to you. I thought you were my best friend.

You weren't. You went to someone and told them I was being an annoying whining bitch to call you whenever I was upset. You said you had your own problems and hearing mine was just frustrating to you because I could have just dealt with it.

What's worse is that I had high expectations of you than others. You saw how bad my knees were and when I needed surgery you listened to someone else who said I was lying rather than believe me. Why would I lie to you about that? Then you go and join in with the others and ignore me and leave me out of plans. Suddenly all those amusement park trips and days talking about video games and anime were nothing but a lie.

Then I see you years later and you have the nerve to ask me why I didn't try harder? Try harder for what??

To be your friend? To do what, exactly? Talking to you had to be like walking on eggshells because if I mentioned something making me upset it would be 'whining'. 

I don't need you to be my 'friend'. I don't need pity because after I left that hell of a high school I made real friends. And you know what? They call ME to make sure I'm alright.

They know my father well enough that on the 4th of July they called to ask if I was handling it alright.

They held my hand when I needed it most and they were there for me and support me. So, no, I don't need to try harder for someone that never wanted to try for me. It's not a one way street, I did for you and you never tried to do for me. Not once. You always chose others over helping me.

Where were you when everyone laughed at me because I was fat?

Where were you when someone posted that photo of me on facebook to comment insults on it? You stayed friends with that person and said it was 'just a joke'.

Where were you when I went missing in school that day and someone found me crying in a corner? 

You weren't there at all and I am doing better without you. I am taking my medicine and you know what? I may have bad days but I also have good days and good people behind me. 

I don't wish any harm on you, I hope you have a good life. But I don't want to be friends with someone like you. You aren't someone I need in my life. 

Keep talking to those people who lied to you back then about me. 

I hope when you need someone to talk to that they listen to you properly and don't tell you to 'deal with it'. Because no one deserves that. 

And just so you know, even though you ignored me and treated me horribly, when you ran for class president I voted for you. You didn't win but I voted for you.",4,2012-07-12 17:42:25 EDT-0400

Of course, there were a couple panic attacks, and I'm sure the people on the planes will have some good stories to tell their friends, but I got through it!

28,Came up with this analogy for my panic attacks.  I thought I would share.,"A little background to why I thought this up.  When I was younger (maybe 10/11) My dad had a golden retriever.  We would bring her for walks to the park.  One time I wanted to hold the leash.  Since these walks were uneventful, he let me.  Well, she saw another dog and started running.  I didn't have the sense to let go and she dragged me over some dirt and gravel.  It stung a little, but it wasn't anything too serious.  

-----

My analogy:
Having a panic attack is like being dragged by an out of control dog.  You are just along for the ride and get dragged through whatever it wants to run through.

Lately, I've been better at aborting attacks.  It's like I have control of the leash. 

My conclusion:
I will never have control of the dog.  It's not possible to have complete control of another sentient being.  However, I can make sure the dog doesn't go beyond the reach of my leash.  Hopefully I won't be dragged through the gravel, though.

31,"I was a victim of anxiety disorder for 2 years, I just want to.give a little hope.","23f victim of anxiety disorder

Anxiety is worse than any physical pain I could ever recall. It hurts you deeply and so misunderstood! We're called crazy... because no one understands. Mind is constantly racing and your life IS your phobia. Screw deep breathing! I just wanted to be fixed! 

It started when i was 16, I took a medication that I happened to later find out I was allergic to. It was a Sunday so I had to go to a health clinic because all the doctors offices were closed. My heart was racing (144 resting heart rate) and I was on the verge of passing out. 

PASSING OUT... FAINTING... that was NOW my phobia. I live in the south east united states so it gets really hot here. Heat scared me... low blood sugar scared me... bridges scared me because I couldn't pull over if I were to faint. (Or so I thought) I checked out from school every single day... until finally they sent me to the school shrink and I realized I had an anxiety problem. I did crazy things like not getting in a car unless it was already turned on with air conditioning for a few minutes and I had to have an ice pack with me. Always carried bananas and crackers in my backpack at school just incase I happen to get low blood sugar.
After about 3 months they started medicating me. Lexipro...Buspar (both anxiety medications) stomach medication (due to the anxiety I was producing too much stomach acid) I was in HELL... I wanted to die. This was no way to live... I surely couldn't live like this forever. I couldn't drive... leave my house... hang out with friends. I was too scared... worst part is no one understood. 

Fast forward to 3 therepists and 4 medications later I met someone who saved my life. She was a Cognitive Behavioral therepist... after 2 years of my life wasted to my phobia she fixed me. She forced me to face my fears. That's all I had to do.. face my fears! Cognitive behavioral therepy saved my life... I am now 23 years old and on no medications for anxiety. Passing out is not even a thought that crosses my mind.  Here's a few tips she gave me: 

* carry your ice pack around to hot places... you'll use it until you realize you won't need it anymore. (Use your crutch to help you get out. Slowly pull yourself apart from it at your own pace.) 

*DEEP BREATHING..deep breathing always made me feel worse... like I couldn't breathe. So I started to count.. 1..2...3..4..5... in....5..4...3..2..1 out. I was in control. 

*crossing the bridge was the hardest thing for me. I had to do it because I live in a small town where you HAVE to cross a 3 mile bridge to get to anything worth while. I would call my mom everyday to and from work or school. Making her talk the whole way. Then... I only needed her half way... then a quarter... then not at all. (Again using a crutch to help you... I used it until I didn't need to anymore.) 

*always carrying a small snack... turned into just carrying a dollar or 2 to go the vending machine just incase I was feeling a little low and hungry. 


Anyway I know this isnt much but I wanted to give some people a little hope. Seeing other people go through something that controls their life...its anything but fair. Its a long road but it will get better... this isn't the end. :) ",15,2012-05-28 21:21:24 EDT-0400
32,That feeling....,"Sometimes, it creeps up on me slowly. It starts small with, almost like the pressure in the room has doubled, like the concussion of an explosion it washes over me, unexpectedly.

33,I need urgent help..,"first of all, i would like to state that i am 16 years old and im in 10th grade. i have had anxiety for as long as i can remember, which for the record is around 6th grade i think. that anxiety has gotten worse and worse especially when it comes around other people including girlfriends, which gets so bad i got stomach aches. i went to the doctors for a checkup and she gave me some medicine, which helped with the stomach aches, but didnt really help with the anxiety as a whole, but i attempted to cope with it, as i did the last 3 years (the current time in the 'story' is me around 15 years old, maybe 14). as the year passed i started feeling uncomfortable in class and school and just public places in general, i would get a dry mouth, start sweating, and studder which was embarrassing, and extremely hard to cope and on top of that hide. in the beginning of 10 grade (current school year) is where things go from bad to extremely terrible. from day 1 in the school year my medicine hasnt been helping, so i got new medicine that helped for a bit, so i thought everything was alright. on a sidenote, i am extremely close to my dad, who i havent seen in a while due to his recent breakup with his girlfriend, and that really took a toll on him emotionally. for a couple months he calls me and tells me that he is really stressed and wants it all to go away, me being a caring person i want to help him but i cant because my mom isn't the best parent in the world and forbids me and my siblings from seeing him. my dad then got so stressed out that he got a heart attack. that is when i had the worst panic attack of my life, and sent me into a deep depression. i stopping going to school, talking to friends, and doing stuff productive in general. i have missed so much school this year and im really scared, but i cant force myself to get up everyday with so much pressure on my shoulders from my dad. and the heart attack isnt even all of it. my grandma who is 74, had open heart surgery and almost died, and that certainly didnt add to my feelings at all. months pass of me laying in bed most days and not doing anything and my dad slowly recovers but is still pretty torn up about everything. one night he called me and told me to meet him at a near by dunkin donuts, me being excited to see him ran over but was soon disappointed because he told me he is going. i was really confused at the time and wasnt sure what to think. he wouldnt tell me where and when he was leaving so i kept badgering him to tell me. he told me he was going to kill himself. if anyone reading this hasnt had their dad who they loved dearly tell them straight to their face that they are going to kill themselves, its a knife straight though your heart. i start bawling my eyes out on the spot and dont know what to think... so he gives me a note saying he loves me. his wallet, his phone, and a little toy i gave him when i was little that he has had since... i walked home crying so hard i couldnt breathe, and to this day i have no idea where he is and if he is ok... i called his sister and she said she got in touch with him but he wont tell her anything... i am literally depressed to the point where i dont feel like living anymore. my mother finally got off her lazy drunken ass (her drunk attitude also adds to my feelings... more stuff go figure) and gets me a therapist. ive only went 3 times but i feel nothing yet. i really need advice/help from someone. i dont know what to do about my dad, about school, about my future. im also scared about my relationship because im not one to open up physically to someone, and my girlfriend is getting mad about that... i feel sorry for her but i just cant do it. i don't know what im doing right now and im scared. please help. thank you.

35,"Nearing a panic attack.  Mostly needed to write out my thoughts, support is appreciated.","I am on the borderline of a panic attack.  My anxiety is very high right now, it almost feels like something as slight as a pin dropping could set me off into a full blown attack.  I have not felt this way in a while.  For starts, I'm 25 y/o, female, and have bipolar (I'm on medications..lithium, lamictal, and clonazepam for the anxiety mostly).

I think my issue is that work is stressing me out.  I travel sometimes for work, but this month I have traveled every week, only being at home on the weekends.  And tonight I'm in a crappy motel.  It's loud, there's not much security, the room is SUPER tiny, so the environment mixed with ""I miss my home, and my dog, and my friends"" is just a lethal combination.  But I don't know what else I can do, fellow redditors.  I've already taken my medicine.  I don't want to take more than the regular dose.  I just can't control my own thoughts right now and it's making me feel nauseous and my head hurts and I just want an escape but there is none. I HAVE to stay for work.  And all other hotels in the area are booked.  I can't take a walk (normally helps) because the area is unsafe.  

I'm trapped.  And so I am panicking.  I figured writing it out would help because I don't have anyone to call.  I mean, I DO, but I don't want to burden them, you know?  My dad is really sick so I don't want to wake my parents.

I guess I just needed to vent.  And maybe hear ideas on other coping mechanisms.  

Arghh this is hard...internet hugs to anyone feeling the same way right now.



EDIT: Thanks guys, so much. I'd thank you all individually but I'm actually sleepy and relaxed tonight! Yay! Funny how it (anxiety and panic) always seems like it's never going to go away...but it always does. Logically I should be able to remember that and get my thoughts under control. Oh well.

36,I have a crush on my therapist.,"*First a small note that there have never been any unprofessional advances in either direction.  She is and has been completely professional.*

She's also the most effective therapist that I've had.  I've been able to work with her to get reassurance and some skills to combat panic attacks.

She's around my age, maybe a couple years younger (mid to late twenties).  She's attractive to me.  She's really nice and is the first therapist that I've had that seems to really understand what's going on in my head (probably because of our common age group and that she's been in school recently and is familiar with the newest anxiety work).  We actually seem to have a lot in common - at least based on what little we talk about her experiences.  I also understand that part of the reason I may feel this way is that she is supposed to be a positive person in my life.

I have a wife that I love dearly and two wonderful kids.  I wouldn't jeopardize this for anything, especially a little crush - even if the opportunity to make more of it arose.  

Is it OK to keep up with the same therapist?  I really would like to because, despite my crush, I think her input and the goals that she helps me set are really helping me.  I personally think it is, but I am looking for either reassurance that I am thinking clearly or that I am just deluding myself.

Thanks everyone.",13,2012-05-22 21:49:29 EDT-0400
37,How do you explain anxiety to someone who just doesn't get it? [RANT],"I suffer from generalized anxiety, social phobia, depression, and insomnia. My dad doesn't understand, he just keeps telling me to ""get out there"" and ""you can't do anything if you're in your room all day."" 


I live in a tourist town. There are no permanent jobs here unless you get lucky. I apply for average retail jobs (CVS, Acme Markets, Kmart, Walmart, ShopRite, Wawa, Michaels, Bed Bath and Beyond, GameStop, Office Depot, JC Penny, Pets Mart, Dollar General, and more) every 60~90 days like clockwork, year-round. He insinuates that, because he sees me sleeping past noon, I'm a lazy piece of shit and I'm *clearly* not trying very hard to get a job. 


You know what is popular in tourist towns? Restaurants. You know what positions have been open, for the past month, at these restaurants? Hosts and servers. You know what I can't do? EXACTLY THAT. I can *barely* interact with people via cashiering, and I'm going to take ORDERS for them!? I had panic attacks working in the CVS pharmacy when people would get mad at me over their prescriptions. The thought of getting somebody's dinner wrong scares the shit out of me.


And it's not like I'm fucking squandering my time away in my bedroom. I spend all of my time studying (programming, history, misc research for my writing, art guides, music theory, cooking, and others) and pursuing my dream career (being a successful webcomic artist). In the past few months, I've taught myself how to draw. I couldn't draw stick figures before this year, and now I can *almost* draw people. Writing has always been a passion of mine, even when I was little, I would write and write, and everybody just fucking put me down for being creative. Teachers, parents, peers, nobody gave a shit that I could write except people on the internet. Nobody thinks I can be successful, nobody fucking believes in me, despite the fact that I have legitimate potential.

EDIT: And he KNOWS I do these things, because I've *shown* him the progress I've made. He's an artist too, a painter, and I always thought he would understand, but guess what? OF COURSE HE DOESN'T.


What the fuck am I supposed to do? Of course I want a job, I want income, I'd love to have fucking money. How am I supposed to get this shit across to somebody who is a primary source of my mental problems? How the hell do you fucking get a point across to somebody who *doesn't believe you*?

41,[Help] Paralyzed.,"I'm one of these cases who is too anxious to get help with his anxiety.

I have an intense fear, hatred and resentment for anybody in a position of authority such as receptionists, doctors, teachers, police, anybody.

I'm recently unemployed and have no close friends.  I was recently cast out by my fiancee and given my ring back and was left with a week to find a place to live in a strange city.  

I sit around in my apartment as my unemployment insurance dwindles.  I cry myself to sleep.  I harm myself in desperate moments of anguish and despair.  I smash my head into walls, I punch myself in the arms, I tear at my hair and I bite and chew at my hands until they are raw, all in order to try and make my brain shut up for a minute.

I would have no social life if not for the internet and I couldn't leave the house if not for brief moments of clarity afforded by smoking marijuana, being drunk or when on my medication, clonazepam.

The clonazepam is supposed to be a quick-fix to panic attacks and isn't meant to work on a day to day basis.

The last time I saw a therapist, I lied to him.  Told him I wasn't experiencing any paranoia, that it wasn't interfering with my life.  He believed me and sent me on my way.  When put on the spot with somebody of authority, I clam up and say whatever the fuck it is I have to in order to get away from there.

I want to die.  I dream of the sweet release of death, how it will finally be an end to pain, suffering, dread, anxiety, depression, loneliness, all of it.   The only time I'm able to focus is with the calming thought of finally dying, finally letting all the dread slip away.  It is bliss.

47,Hoping to get a good book recommendation.,"Throwaway, just because.

*I have a debilitating fear of a family member or loved one dying* and this gets worse with each passing day. I really want to focus on dealing with this, as I have a daughter and I don’t want her to grow up with her mother being this way. I have vivid visions of terrible things happening - my daughter drowning, my husband crashing our car into a tree, my parents randomly dying, choking on a piece of steak and dying, my daughter eating a battery without us noticing and her dying, etc. The other day, my daughter fell (she’s one year old, kids fall, I get that) and she fell on her face, and I completely lost it. I imagined her breaking her neck with the fall and dying, right there on the spot. She seriously cried for five seconds and picked herself up and ran off, but I was completely lost for the rest of the day, crying and unable to snap out of it.

I have severe anxiety in the car and stopped driving six years ago. Even when I’m riding in the car, I’m so worried sick by the time we get anywhere that I can’t enjoy myself.

It seems that every day I’m just blinded by these thoughts, and the happier the day is, the worse they are. If I’m having a wonderful day, the invasive thoughts are that much more pervasive, and I have to remember to smile and force myself to not cry. I have always felt that I can’t allow myself to get too happy, because that’s when shit will hit the fan.

I love reddit, but I’m constantly hitting the “hide” button to keep myself from reading terribly depressing stories. I can only watch tv comedies anymore because I can’t deal with watching anything sad happening in fear of these invasive thoughts.

I could continue, but I think I’ve gotten my point across.

I’m asking two things of you, reddit: 1) what is this? ocd? gad? It doesn’t matter too much, I’m just curious. 2) More importantly, what books can I read to help myself? I understand that I may need more than a self-help book, but this is where I want to begin. I can’t help but think about a therapist sitting there listening to me and thinking “SNOOOOOOORE” while I blather on, and medicine is last resort for me, so I really want to start with some good reading.

48,"I have horrific social anxiety and got a job, get this, counseling anxiety patients. Wuite frankly I could BE one of these patients. Looking for thoughts and advice.","Hey guys and girls. I've had crippling social/general anxiety for years now. I managed to graduate with a psych degree and recently had some interviews as a counselor at a psychiatric hospital. I'm generally a shut in and this job involves dealing with groups of people all day long, running groups (charades, talks, games, stuff like that), and running meetings. Quite frankly I'm terrified and unsure if I'll be able to do it. I'm looking at it as an extremely intense exposure therapy session for myself. I think because of my struggles I will be able to relate and help people and that excites me, I feel like I could be amazing at the job, but I'm scared shitless. This isn't just in my head either the first interviewer even asked if I was ""kind of awkward"" and I just told him that I get a little nervous in interviews. But truth be told because of my anxiety I am pretty awkward these days. 


I think that because of my anxiety background I'll be able to relate to residents and be of help to them, and being in this environment will be helpful to me as well.

It isn't because I have places to go, it is because I feel like the world is watching me and I can't take the stress.  If I do go out, every encounter seems like I am a deer in headlights.

54,Thought I would share my anxiety story.  I'm a 38 year-old man...,"...father of two.  My son is about 3 and his new daughter is 4 months.  I've been married 4 years and have a great career that keeps me busy.  

On a day-to-day-basis, I would say my anxiety is anywhere from 0-2, with occasional flare ups.  I don't really get anxious about meeting people anymore, I don't get nervous about speaking or presenting in public, and even serious issues cause me to think analytically and not react emotionally. 

20 years ago I had significant **Generalized Anxiety Disorder.**  But back then it had no name; restlessness is what I termed it.  Particularly in the morning, when I would wake up with my heart racing concerned that I had to get up and get things done.  

After college, I worked my first job constantly anxious as I sat at my desk.  I was ""shifty"" and ""fidgety,"" as my body reacted to the chemicals my nervous brain fired out.  I would sometimes wake in the night and shift for hours, tired in the head but racing in the body. 

I tried **traditional psychotherapy** for years.  There's a veritable collective of psychoanalysts who could write my biography, and none helped me with my anxiety in the slightest.  I tried EMDR, hypnosis, massage, yoga, and other approaches to try and cure my anxiety.  The best I experienced was very short-term relief.  I suppose this is why anxious people literally can spend decades in traditional psychotherapy.  

**Then, I discovered it.** I had this friend 10 years ago, a really smart, great guy who would cave under the weight of any size stressor.  He had the only ""nervous breakdown"" I've ever witnessed, and submitted to an out-patient treatment program after being hospitalized for a week.  

In that treatment program, my friend learned **Rational Emotive Behavior Therapy.** That's all I knew: the name, nothing more.  He came out of a few-week long program (2-4, can't remember) a changed man.  His mind was able to address potential stressors and keep things in balance. 

I took to the Internet to learn about REBT.  I looked on Pubmed and other sites, and learned that REBT was the precursor, to a degree, of what is now known as **Cognitive Behavioral Therapy.** I knew nothing about its approach; I knew only that more and more studies were establishing its effectiveness for treating - even curing - certain anxiety and depression disorders. 

I found a guy at a major teaching university and started going.  The very first session, which I would compare in my world to finding Jesus, went like this: 

ME:  Every day I am anxious. 

HIM:  About? 

ME:  Work, I think. 

HIM:  What are you thinking about at work? 

ME:  I have thoughts that I **cannot** get my work done, and I have **too much to do,** and I'm **going to mess something up,** and **I am overwhelmed.**

HIM:  In the 4 years you have been doing your job, tell me exactly how many times you:  **could not** get work done, had **too much** to do such that you did not get the work done, **messed something up,** or were so **overwhelmed** you could not function? 

ME:  (thinking for a few minutes).  None. 

HIM:  Does it strike a chord in you to know that you literally have been lying to yourself every day at work?  That these things you tell yourself ""will, are going to, must, shall, and were likely to"" happen have never happened?  

I realized that the cause of my anxiety was my thoughts.  My specific thoughts.  

I read and read and worked diligently at CBT exercises.  I became very good at locating, analyzing, and defeating many thoughts I have had for years that have caused anxiety and other problems in my life.  

In order to improve my interpersonal relationships, I also got a book on couples CBT and a lot of material - surprisingly - on pick-up artists and social theory.  I'm very happily married and love my wife, but learning about how people attract each other has a positive impact on non-sexual relationships, as well.  There is a core to pick up artists that teaches the foundation of success and good relationships: confidence, belief in yourself, composure, addressing self-defeating beliefs, and communicating on deeper levels. 

I have previously made a few posts about the approach I'm very familiar with and my interest in helping others learn it and apply it.  Would love to help or answer any questions. ",32,2012-03-10 06:33:15 EST-0500

57,Some insight into the anxious brain and the theories of two treatment modalities. ,"If you start thinking of your mind as containing ""layers,"" you can start applying principles of **Cognitive Behavioral Therapy** and **Mindfulness.**  (you can search for scientific articles at http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=cognitive%20behavioral%20therapy)

 At their core, both approaches theorize that your **emotions are caused by your thoughts.**  In other words, the reason you feel sad, anxious, angry, frustrated, guilty, embarrassed, etc., is because you have certain negative thoughts that are commonly associated with these specific emotions.  

The negative thoughts that cause negative emotions commonly pass through our minds extremely quickly and repeatedly, without our being fully aware of them.  For example, if you were in class and the teacher told you that you were the first to give your presentation that day, your stomach might drop and the adrenaline would pump.  At the semi-conscious level, you would be thinking things like ""I'm not ready,"" or ""I'm going to mess up,"" or ""I hate speaking in front of people,"" or ""I'm going to look like an idiot."" 

These types of thoughts bounce in our heads all day long (and at night, when we're trying to sleep).  Is it any wonder anxious people cannot sleep when their brains are repeatedly telling them that they are going to be failures, or alone forever, or embarrassed in public if they leave the house tomorrow?  

The key to ending anxiety is to understand how your brain works.  Your intellect, consciousness, and reasoning skills evolved well after your ability to run, fight, perceive danger, and react thoughtlessly in order to survive.  Your intellectual brain does not have the ability to logically analyze thoughts of danger - you literally cannot just do it without learning how.  

For example, if you have thoughts that people ""are going to laugh at you"" if you try to be social, your upper brain cannot just 'reason' those thoughts away.  What happens instead is that your brain asks the **wrong kinds of questions** in response, such as ""I shouldn't be anxious like this"" or ""This is embarrasing to be anxious like this** or **There is something wrong with me for acting like this.**  As you can imagine, these conscious thoughts serve only to increase your negative emotions and cause more anxiety!

Here is how Cognitive Behavioral Therapy and Mindfulness approach the problem with your brain reacting emotionally to automatic, semi-conscious thoughts:  

Cognitive Behavioral Therapy teaches you to identify those thoughts, put them into words, list them out on paper, and then, when your upper brain has a chance to review them fully, only then do you analyze those thoughts and eventually learn that they are false, exaggerated, unsupported by facts, or have some other distorted, irrational portion. 

Similarly, Mindfulness teaches you to identify the same thoughts, but instead of trying to analyze them and lend them little weight because you realize those thoughts are false, you learn to separate your emotional reactions from thoughts.  You learn to accept thoughts as merely 'thoughts,' nothing more, and you maintain your conscious focus on the real world that you are perceiving here and now.  

Importantly - **neither of these methods requires you to fight your thoughts.**  In fact, that appears to be a mistake that just causes more anxiety.  You can't consciously fight these thoughts.  You have to learn to destroy them logically through CBT or distance your conscious brain and emotional reactions from mere thoughts through mindfulness. 


I highly recommend **audiobooks** for your car, iPod, etc. to teach you these methods and explain them, especially if you have trouble focusing or reading. 

Good luck, happy to answer questions. ",5,2012-03-14 07:29:25 EDT-0400

But I dont have a perscription and have to go to my friends which I don't like doing,  but i'm desperate.  I've asked my parents to bring me to a doctor for months, and even when I emphasize how bad it is, they tell me that no doctor will perscribe benzos to a teenager. (I asked a question about xanax on here before)

 Lately when I've been having panic attacks I can't help but think it would be easier if I ended it all... because it's a never ending cycle of mental suffering, yet I would never attempt anything like that. I understand that I won't get the help I need unless I do something crazy, because my parents refuse to bring me to the doctor. Please.. any advice?",14,2012-03-13 21:53:11 EDT-0400
59,Worried my anxiety is negatively affecting my relationship,[deleted],7,2012-03-12 15:15:16 EDT-0400
60,I get nauseous from any burst of emotion - positive or negative.,"I have been telling people that I have had stomach problems for a couple of years now, since maybe 2007 or so. I got food poisoning from a frozen pizza, and since then I had just been getting nauseous from what seems like no reason. When I thought more about it, I have always had nausea problems, just not this severe.

When I was a kid, I used to frequent a local theme park. I had an annual pass, so it was a thing for me to go almost every weekend just to hang out. When I would get home and try to sleep, my mind would be stuck in theme park mode. My mind would make me feel like I was riding the rides, feeling the excitement. It would keep me up at night, crying that I couldn't sleep, and throwing up constantly. I never thought too much of it, except for the fact that I might be prone to motion sickness.

Fast forward to after the food poisoning incident where I was getting nauseous about every couple of weeks. I noticed a trend that it was whenever I had a surge of emotion. If I were anxious, excited, nervous, upset, happy...anything...I would get nauseous and vomit. This would ruin the rest of my day/night. I would start shaking and would pass out from exhaustion eventually for the night. This still happens every so often, but I've gathered a routine that kind of helps when I feel something like this come on.

Obviously this causes problems in my daily life. I've tried seeing a doctor, but he hasn't figured much out since it's not really a physical thing. He gave me stomach relaxers at some point and they worked wonderfully, except for the fact that I would always take naps. After the prescription ran out and I had researched the topic, I got into smoking cannabis. This helps out wonderfully most of the time. Every once in a while it'll make things worse, but usually I smoke before bed so I just go to sleep anyways. Before this, I started taking Dramamine (a motion sickness medication sold over the counter, usually at 7-11's or drugstores) to calm my stomach down. This helps, but it knocks me on my ass because it's a drowsy formula.

Enough of the ranting. Really, what I'm trying to figure out, is if anybody else here has had anything similar to this happen to them and what they did to alleviate the nausea. I meditate every so-often, but not enough to work. I'm 22, female, and am only on birth control. Stress makes my stomach go crazy and I think myself sick most of the time. :( I just don't know what to do anymore. I apologize for how long this is and if I'm rambling. It's late here, I have work in the morning in about 3 hours and can't sleep because I feel my nausea coming on. I can't take anything that'll knock me out because it won't wear off by the time I have to be at work. So I'm a little delirious at the moment, my apologies. ",15,2012-03-09 13:43:15 EST-0500
61,How can I stop being a people-pleaser?,"Hi reddit!

I'm a 22 year old guy, and I was a victim of pretty severe bullying since before I started elementary school all the way until I got into college. I was a *very* smart kid, and I didn't have great self-esteem, so that made me an easy target for the bullies. I think being picked on every day created an environment for me where I felt totally invalidated, like I had no right to be my own self. I felt like I always needed someone's permission to do what I liked to do. I felt like I had to somehow learn to meet the universe's standards instead of just going out and doing what I liked to do. And I started to believe that being smart was the only thing I was good for. I still believe that, to be honest. I honestly feel like I don't know how to have a ""normal"" conversation with people, and I feel really ashamed about that. Does anyone else feel the same? And do you have any advice for me?",7,2012-03-07 21:59:43 EST-0500
62,I need help Reddit,"Hi!
My fiance and Mother of my 2 year old child just got home from a girls night out and she had the worst anxiety / panic attack I have seen yet.

Because she had to much to drink she poured her heart out about her problems.

Here are some of what i could gather.

First off, I knew she has anxiety problems, she has even said so herself. I just never realised how big of a problem this was for her until now.

Today I learned she has been to her doctor to try and get help, but he said he couldnt prescribe her anything to help but set her up with a shrink who might, but because of her anxiety she just went once because she thought the shrink might have laughed at her after she left.

Some of the things she said scared me. Suicide was a topic, one that she thinks about daily. She thinks both me and our son would be better off without her. She talked about how scared she is that our son might grow up with her problem.
She also mentions other things like how she wishes no one knew who she is, she doesnt want people to talk about her. She wants to move to a place where no one knows who she is. 
She is positive people still remember and talk about the ""stupid"" things she did 10 years ago. Little things like a conversation with a co-worker where she might've said a thing wrong sticks with her for years. She wants to be ""invisible"". 

Every day when I drive to work she's positive im gonna be in a car crash and die so she start planning life without me, how she's going to support our son and who's going to take care of them when im not around.

She is terrified of going to the basement in our appartment complex to wash our clothes because someone might have hung themselves down there. 

Her father passed away over a year ago, and he had some pills in a briefcase along with some other personal stuff that she brought home but she's to afraid to throw the pills away incase they are narcotics and the police might trace it back to her. Oh, and her clothes that are hanging next to the briefcase she hasnt used since she discovered the pills since they might smell like drugs and a drug dog could smell it on her which would cause a scene and people would stare at her/talk about her. 

There was so many more things she talked about. Stuff I or someone might've said years and years ago that i couldnt even remember, she still thought and worried about.

I have told her in the past to perhaps she should try and get some help for her anxiety, but today i realised i need to help her get some help.


I myself dont know anything about anxiety, or what type of problem this is. We've been together for 10 years now but it seems to have gotten alot worse during the last couple of years. 

So Reddit please, how can I help her?

63,Panic attacks about my birthday. What the fuck.,"I really don't know where these stem from. Part of the reason why I'm posting is because I'm lonely and depressed and last time I posted I felt better afterwards.

I'm sitting here listening to Ellie Goulding. 

But anyway, it's not like I don't have friends because I do. I'll be 21 on Sunday (whooooooooooooooooooooooooo legality), and the idea of it causes me panic attacks. I cried while driving home after thinking about the idea. I'm about to panic by writing this. 

I seriously don't fucking get it.

I don't have that ""core"" group of friends like a lot of people. I have randoms here, randoms there. No real group or clique.

67,Severe Hypochondria,"I am constantly afraid of cancer. All it takes is seeing a reference to cancer, especially on reddit,before my day is ruined. I try not to look on WebMD too much, and that helps, but I still think every pain is a tumor. Not to mention, anxiety has started to cause aches in me, which are totally fine as far as pain goes, but incredibly frightening. 


I almost feel like I am destined to have cancer and die. Usually my hypochondria switches in a few days, like when I think I have MS, or something, but I am always afraid of cancer. This started about a month ago when I heard (trigger warning if you are like me, stop reading if you will take on symptoms) someone had their hand feel ""off"" and it turned out to be brain cancer. So immediately I had my hand feel ""off,"" whcih is still does if I think about it. I interpret every sensation as a risk. 


I don't know what to do. I am going abroad to study for a couple months in the summer, and would rather not have to worry about medication. I was  medicated for panic attacks for a year, and haven't gotten them back, but while I was medicated I was still anxious, just not about health stuff. ",5,2012-03-09 03:40:53 EST-0500

78,A post on shame.,"I went for an appointment with my school psychiatrist yesterday, who I will be seeing regularly over the summer. I was discussing how difficult I found it to come into college, how anxious and self-conscious I can feel just walking around busy parts of campus. I explained that I fear seeing people I know. It's hard to describe exactly why I feel so anxious about seeing people that I know. I have pretty much dropped out this year of college (something I've done for the second time now), and although I have really never said a word to ANYONE in my class, I see them all the time. I suppose I feel anxious about what they might think upon seeing me; ""where has he been"" or ""look at him weirdly wandering around by himself again"". It's hard to communicate via text why these might inspire such anxiety, but I do know that encountering certain members of my class does result in huge anxiety. 

That was part of why I had to drop out, just making my way in and out of and around college was such a draining experience. Whenever in there, I would hide away where I was sure noone would see me and waste time on the internet for hours and hours. When I explained that I found the encounter awkward, and the way that you strain to avoid eye contact with this person, even though you only know them to see, he identified that feeling as shame. It was weird to describe one of these encounters (of which I've had hundreds) as such a simple word. Before I've tried to describe them as socially awkward, embarassing, self-conscious. It's weird to see all of those things put in perspective simply by attaching the word ""shame"". And that was exactly it. There are so many aspects of my life of which I am ashamed. Since I've regressed back into this period of moderate social reclusion, I just spend time all day cringing in shame over nearly any past social encounter that I can think of. I'm ashamed of my former self, my dependence on my family, my lack social contact... it almost seems that If it is associated with me in any way, I am ashamed of it. 

I'm an incredibly self-conscious person with incredibly low self-esteem, and although I can put myself out there with an artificial facade of an interesting life, friends and mild confidence, it's just a thin veil covering a life of which I am nearly totally ashamed. I need to learn to change the way I feel about myself and my life to move forward.

I just thought I'd share this, when he mentioned it yesterday it seemed to put the source of nearly all my anxiety into a certain perspective.

82,Is it possible to control anxiety without medication?,"I'm 21 and I've been experiencing anxiety symptoms for as long as I can remember.  I feel nauseous seriously all the time, even when I don't have anything to actually be worried about.  There are very few moments when I *don't* feel like I'm going to be sick.  The feeling gets way worse when I actually have something legitimate to be nervous about, like a job interview or something... those times are like debilitating, I just can't pull myself together and end up getting shaky and it's just a really awful feeling.

I tried citalopram a couple years ago, and on the bright side it got rid of my constant nauseous feeling and improved my general mood (made me worry a lot less about the ridiculous small things I usually spend hours each day obsessing over....), but, the negatives outweighed the postives for me honestly.  I didn't feel necessarily calmed down like I've heard some people say, instead it was the opposite, I felt like... wild, I just had this feeling of not giving a fuck about the consequences of anything I did, which I think was brought on by the citalopram because once I stopped taking it, that feeling went away and I returned to being my cautious self.

My question is this: has anyone been able to control their anxiety without medication?  I really don't like what taking medication did to me so I'd like to avoid it if possible.  I know there are other options besides citalopram, but I'd just really prefer to try and do it myself, I really don't want my decision making or sex drive or anything to be affected by medication.  I just don't know if the constant anxiety I have is even something that can be helped by a non-medicinal solution alone. I do smoke trees so if I'm at home and I have an anxiety attack, I'll smoke a bowl which definitely gets rid of my nausea.  But, of course that isn't really an option when I'm at work, which is why I'm trying to find a solution to get my anxiety under control.

* One girl's family convinced my mother that I was autistic mostly due to my social anxiety, I ended up with a diagnosis and was put in special education. Recently, my doctors have told me that my diagnosis is bullshit and I should never have been put in special classes.

* Another girl befriended several of my cousins after meeting me and would talk badly about me

* Another girl convinced my grandmother she should sell a gift she got me and keep the money, because she thought I was spoiled. 

* Same girl above told me (when I had depression really seriously and was seeking counselling) to go kill myself.

I was horny and everything but whatever I did I couldn't seem to get achieve one. Now this fear has followed me throughout. Most of the time, I'll completely avoid any type of situation that I know will lead to sex. I was once making out with a girl in a bar for an entire night and as soon as she had asked me to come home with her my heart sank, became completely sweaty and couldn't get the idea of not performing out of my head. I declined, and felt like a complete idiot.(probably made her feel pretty bad too) Whenever I'm in the situation, I get extremely shaky, sweaty, my heart beats a million times a minute. At this point I think I just need to ""get back on the horse"" and keep trying. But I'm curious to see if others have experienced this and what advice they can offer me.

Two problems : one its  not going to be efficient or work very well to do a good job, two due to anxiety,a touch of OCD and ADD I stick to routines as much as possible to cope , routines keep me focused and calm.

And due to being a creature of habit, changes in routines are hard to cope with , I have to ease into something or I can't cope with the change well.

102,"[Rant] ""Anxiety is a first world problem: get over it""","A couple of weeks ago, I overheard a conversation between a few of my friends. They were having a discussion about a play we had read in class, specifically on a character who was debated to have some sort of mental illness. This then turned into a discussion solely on mental illness and mental disorders, and how the western world has exploited the term and uses it as a copout to being a contributing member of society. They then decided to just go out and say it: ""Anxiety and depression are both first world problems, and people just seriously need to get over it. They aren't real ailments, so get the hell over yourself.""
Now, they all very well know I struggle with anxiety. They also knew I was in the room. I said nothing throughout the whole discussion, but 10 minutes later, I walked out of the house without saying a word.

Now, I don't know about you, but I'm getting pretty sick and tired of people who have no idea what its like to live with a mental disorder judging others who live with them every single day. NO ONE who struggles with these disorders wants them, so what gives you the right to tell someone to 'get over it'? No. Not okay, and it will never be okay. I struggle with chronic GAD, and have been for a few years, and  none of them know the true extent of how much my anxiety has crippled my ability to preform in school. Its changed my personality, and has recently drawn me away from social situations. There isn't an immediate solution to 'fixing' a disorder that consumes you so fully. It can be so overwhelming, and these people don't get how hard it can be to live with it.

People all over the world deal with anxiety, and although it is proven that western countries have more treated cases, it doesn't give you a right to slap such a negative label on it. its a serious problem in a lot of lives, and needs to be treated delicately, just like you would any ailment.

Nobody wants anxiety, so to those of you who think we do this for attention, you can fuck off.

I'm gonna go cry into my pillow now.

Edit: Wow, I seriously wasn't expecting this many people to reply! Thank you all for your support, advice and words of wisdom. Unfortunately, I know these people will never truly understand where I am coming from, but I now know that there are many of you who get what I'm saying and live with the same disorder I do. I will continue pushing to get better, continue my therapy and medication, and try to focus more of my energy on those who actually care about my wellbeing. Again, gratitude to every single one of you who has sent kindness my way. Namaste. ",63,2012-11-25 09:53:35 EST-0500

107,I called in sick on Black Friday due to anxiety-related reasons and now I fear losing my job. I can't win. Hugs appreciated. [rant],"For thanksgiving I visited my parents, who live about five hours away from where I currently do. I had to work at 11:00 today (small coffee shop/restaurant), and the plan was for me to wake up at 4:00 am and drive back so I could enjoy Thanksgiving dinner with my family and make it to work on time.

By 4:00 I had slept less than two hours due to stressing about the drive and other family issues. I started panicking and crying, knowing that I was going to have a full on panic attack if I attempted the drive (I've dozed off at the wheel before, which is terrifying and something I never want to do again.) My mom and I decided that calling in sick so I could get some sleep and drive up later would be the best plan of action.

I called at 7:00 am (we open at 6:30 and I was so nervous and guilty about calling in), and it turned out someone else scheduled today had already called in sick. My boss had some choice words for me, especially when she found out I was still five hours away and ""couldn't make it if I tried"" (her words), especially when she ""gave me the whole week off,"" (not true, we were closed Thursday, a coworker who owed me a favor worked for me on Tuesday, and I happened to have Monday off. The only day I requested off was Wednesday.) 

I don't blame her for being upset. I feel like I've let down my boss, my fellow employees, my family, and most of all myself. I worry that I might not have a job after this, which is fine when you're 16 and still live with your parents. I'm 24, with a (useless) bachelor's degree, and this was the only job I can get while I attend more school to try and make my degree less useless. I now realize how stupid of me it was to think that I could actually wake up that early and get to work on time with my history of anxiety and trouble sleeping. 

And this is what I hate the most about anxiety, and all mental disorders. Things that seem so easy for everyone else, like making phone calls or even just sleeping, become huge obstacles. And I can't tell my boss what's really going on because I know she won't care or believe me. I'm watching all my peers become successful adults while I can't even make it to my shitty barista job. I know I am capable of so much more but the littlest things are so hard and sometimes I just want to give up.

I'm currently typing this at a busy Starbucks about 1/3 of the way home. I still feel awful and am having trouble concentrating on the road. I dread going to work tomorrow and especially Monday, when my boss will be back. I don't really know what to do, I just want my bed and my cat. 

Thank you so much for reading this, I do feel a little better after typing it out. Huge hugs to everyone who struggles like I do, I hope your Black Friday is going better than mine. ",34,2012-11-24 02:25:52 EST-0500

115,"While rushing to get ready for school the other day, I noticed I had two different pills left in my medication jar. I knew one was Propranolol, and the other was Ibuprofen, only I wasn't sure which was which. I took the one I presumed to be Propranolol, and the results were interesting.","So I didn't recognize the pills I had left in my jar. I knew one was Ibu, and the other was Propranolol. One was red and one was green. I made the best guess I could, and took the red one, mostly because it just seemed to be higher quality than the almost chalky green one. I have really bad anxiety and couldn't afford to take the wrong one.

So fast forward an hour, I get to school. I'm completely calm, and even a bit daring. I walk into class with people staring at me, no problem. My heart doesn't race at all, it felt like it was beating pretty slowly. Actually to be perfectly honest, at some points it felt like it was beating *too* slowly. I had barely any anxiety symptoms, and even felt the need to volunteer in my second class to read out loud from our book. I was so calm it was weird, and then at that point I for sure thought I took the correct pill.

Then I get home and finally have time to google which pill was actually which, and I come to find out I actually took the Ibuprofen instead. I was completely shocked! How was that even possible? I felt like maybe just the fact that I took a pill that I presumed to be for handling my anxiety, my brain just went with it. Kind of like a sugar pill or non alcoholic beer that dumb teenagers think is alcoholic. I'm not sure if Ibuprofen somehow lessened my anxiety? I'm not even sure if it does that. Or it was just my brain and body thinking I handled my problem and just accepting that fact and going with it.

My anxiety had been receding for months now but yesterday there was a big flareup. I think it had to do with a few factors: driving 1.5 hours away to a job interview, being excited to meet people I knew from college, and also the stress of having an interview. I felt really shaky and my heart was absolutely pounding in the car. 

Right now I feel pretty tranquil because I took a xanax 0.5 on the way back. Although it really makes me calm and collected I would really, really not have to take xanax prn because I always have a terrible hangover-style headache the next day.

So what are some ways you guys use to keep panic away while driving? I know panic attacks won't kill you, but I still feel driving while being so distracted is very dangerous.",18,2012-11-28 18:34:11 EST-0500

124,I still don't know how to communicate my needs properly.,"(Written on my iPhone, I apologize if there are any mistakes)

More specifically to my boyfriend. Firstly, this isn't his problem. I have had issues with this that I had to work the kinks out with in my own, but I still could use some help. This is related to anxiety more so than pure relationship issues.

I still struggle sometimes when wanting to say ""Hey, I need you. I'm having a bad moment and could jus use some comfort."" I already realize it would be easy to just say this, but sometimes I have this wall built up because I am afraid if him rejecting my needs(in one way or another).

He doesn't quite understand the struggle with anxiety. Fair enough, most people don't. I can honestly say that I have reached a better place without his help, but things don't turn around over night. I still have relapses and irrational/obsessive thoughts. I get anxious when I want to communicate these thoughts because I am afraid of upsetting him. He gets frustrated when he I feel this way because he thinks I have no reason to feel this way. He also gets very defensive if it might be n irrational thought about him. I tried to explain to him that I don't actually believe my thoughts wholeheartedly, but I need some reassurance to make them go away.

When e gets frustrated and defensive, I kind of shut down. It's a self protective measure. Instead of thinking ""Hey, I know you're frustrated, but just relax. This isn't about you."" I think ""Omg, I'm just making things worse. He hates me. I should just disappear (me shutting down)."" 

Also, when he gets into his negative moods, he tends to pull away, leaving me in the dark. I know he needs his space, but I feel anxious about approaching him. I just end up mirroring his actions, which also frustrates him at times because he hates when I just pull away rather than speak up. I also tend to pull away because he often says ""I don't know what to say or do"" or ""you have to try to help yourself sometimes."" I know all of these things, but they make me feel like I am on my own. I don't expect him to fix anything, but I would like comfort sometimes.

Anyway, how do I communicate better while battling that inner anxious voice? How do I help him understand that sometimes his actions affect how I want to approach him? and I do I do this without getting into old habits?

Any thoughts would be appreciated! ",4,2012-11-27 02:36:23 EST-0500

128,Tonight I am proud.,"(I posted this in [/r/stopdrinking](/r/stopdrinking) but I think it's pretty applicable here too. Maybe someone can relate)

I'm usually my worst critic. In fact I'm too hard on myself. 

This past while I've been dealing with pretty bad anxiety and depression. I don't know where it came from or why at this stage in my life (late 20's) it decided to show up. But fuck it, it's here and I'm doing my best to deal with it.

So anyway, tonight I had a first date. Now, normally I would have a few drinks before such an occasion - the old dutch courage, if you will - because I'm normally nervous in these situations. Add the anxiety on top of that and this makes dealing with nervous situations like this even worse.

But I said: Fuck it, I'm not going to drink. Whatever happens tonight I'm not going to drink. I'm gonna feel what I'm gonna feel and I'm not gonna dull it with alcohol. Feeling nervous is okay. I'm okay.

I told myself: Who cares if you have an anxiety attack? Make this the worst date ever and have fun. Don't put pressure on yourself that everything has to go well. Make it the worst date ever and have fun.

This is just a mental trick I've started to learn. I tell myself that it's okay to be bad at stuff and it usually relaxes me.

Long story short, the date went great. I have really sore shoulders now because of the stress and anxiety during it, but I never felt like drinking once. Drinking was my safety blanket. Now I'm glad it's gone and I can experience being alive without feeling the need to dull my feelings.

It's like I'm saying to the world, this is me. I'm nervous and anxious and stressed but I'm okay. These feelings are okay.

Tonight was a big deal for me. I'm making sure that the new me takes time to appreciate myself and I just wanted to share it with someone.

There were a few times where I felt the anxiety rise and I thought an anxiety attack was coming but I tried my best just to let go. And you know what? It never materialised. Not once. And, although I can't guarantee it, I'm petty sure my date never paid one bit of heed to it.

Anxiety is the wizard behind the curtain, it's all smoke and mirrors. I have to learn to stand my ground and allow the feelings to be, just be, without judging them, without wishing them away. Because if I challenge the anxious thoughts, the panicky thoughts, the thoughts of impending doom, then anxiety turns out to be a con - it doesn't deliver.

Alcohol used to cloud this. But now I'm standing my ground. ",8,2012-01-09 04:12:21 EST-0500

138,I suspect I might have anxiety problems. A few questions?,"Hi r/anxiety. Just found this subreddit while searching for others who might be in a similar place and wanted to ask a few questions. *(tl;dr at bottom)*

**Background:** I'm mid-20's with a good full-time job and a wonderful life. Engaged to a wonderful loving partner and surrounded by very loving people. A few years ago, however, I went through a really dark period and dealt with issues such as self-harm and an eating disorder. Luckily before it could head down a more serious path, I began to realize the negative effects it was having on my life and turned it around through finding new (healthy) friends and relationships as well as physical exercise.

**Presently:** Since that time, I've been doing really well. No issues eating or self-harming as I am now able to identify them as very shitty coping mechanisms and try to figure out the bigger stress triggers that lead to these impulses. And normally I'm quite fine - doing my normal daily thing and enjoying life.

The first time I began noticing my issues with anxiety, however, was about almost a year or so after my grandfather passed. We watched him waste away from cancer, which was awful, but he peacefully passed and it's not the first time I've ever seen death. We've had a few family members / family friends pass over my lifetime thus far and many of them from cancer.

Looking back, I feel like something switched on about the year to year and a half after he passed - some kind of ""oh yeah, btw, you're going to die"" kind of mental revelation. It's not that I didn't know this - clearly we all do, but I began to think about death and what that meant. Fast forward to now and I'm ***still*** struggling with these thoughts. It's a daily bombardment of almost obsessive thinking. ""How am I going to die?"" ""Will I die first?"" ""How will that affect others around me?"" ""Am I headed into a dangerous situation?"" ""Is today my last day??""

I gave it a few weeks, thinking it would just pass. It didn't, I began to notice the cyclical nature of these thoughts and the lack of moving *past* them. Which got me really tense and nervous about myself and wondering what was wrong with me.

It's gotten to the point it's impacting my ability to enjoy life. For a few months I *really* struggled, then finally it abated somewhat and I wouldn't have those thoughts very often at all. Several months of relief and then suddenly these thoughts were back - and I feel silly for even having them, but they just won't quit. I've tried positive thinking and trying to distract myself, but it's not very effective as my negative thoughts feel very overwhelming.

The few talks I've had about it with loved ones results in them saying, ""Just don't think about it,"" and asking me why in the world I'm even thinking about that. I don't know and I wish it were that simple.

Over the past few weeks, I've begun to experience some chest pains, light-headedness, and shortness of breath whenever stressful situations arise. A few really big stressers popped up and I would feel my mind go totally blank - can't even formulate a coherent thought or function like a rational person, feel like I have to forcibly remind myself to breathe and try to act normal.

I begin to freak out far more than I feel I should, and combined with my everyday battle against morbid thoughts of mortality, I'm feeling really uncomfortable all the time. It's getting to the point I'm nervous it will start creeping into affecting the happy relationship with the love of my life / family / etc. and I don't know what to do.

**Questions:**

* What first steps should I take to alleviate these issues? Who can/should I see?

* What am I even going through? Can anyone relate?

* What are some short-term solutions to help me cope?


At this point I'm tired of the anxiety - so tired of feeling nervous and on edge, tired of not being able to enjoy calm, happy moments without the intrusion of these thoughts. I need help. Any advice / suggestions / tips?

**TL;DR - Tired of suffering from anxiety for closing in on a year or so. What are some short/long term suggestions for dealing with this? Can anyone share similar experiences and possible tips?** Many thanks. :)",6,2012-01-11 19:25:03 EST-0500

141,Intense public speaking anxiety,"Hi so I'm pretty new to reddit, but I've been reading /r/anxiety for a while and can relate to a lot of you.

I started getting panic attacks a couple of years ago, which I can honestly say has been one of the most horrific experiences of my life, where I ended up in a and e thinking I was having a heartattack. Since that, it's really torn my confidence away from me. Not that self-esteem and confidence was that high before but somehow it made it so much worse.

Though my panic attacks for the most part have subsided, my recent and quite severe issue is fear of public speaking. I was always quite scared of public speaking but I'd mumble through what I had to say, be it small presentations in front of class mates and move on after a little bit of anxiety about it a few days before. Since the panic attacks though it has just go so much worse. I dread weeks, even months before a scheduled presentation. If it doesn't count for my course I'll avoid it at all costs, such as calling in sick because it's that much mental torture to me. Even now with assessed presentations I can't actually face them. I've even e-mailed professors to conduct them in more private environments.

Now I know that the only way to overcome them is by just doing them over and over. I do know that, but with intense anxiety it's never really that simple to face it. It's very taxing on my overall health and mental stamina, the constant worrying wears me out. I'm frankly sick of letting something so minor rule my life. I have been to see a doctor who has offered CBT and anti anxiety meds (citalopram / celexa). Though I'm quite sceptical if taking citalopram will help with stuff like this. I haven't started the offered therapy yet though due to horrendously busy university commitments.

So what I'm really asking is, fellow / ex sufferers what's your story? how did you deal with it? overcome it? etc. Did you ever do what I did and avoid them by calling in sick? And did the therapy I was offered help you? (even if not related to public speaking etc.)",5,2012-01-09 03:11:44 EST-0500

149,Mild-moderate anxiety worried about xanax (alprazolam),"Sorry for the long post, thank you to anyone who reads or replies.

I have whats probably mild-moderate anxiety: excessive/repetitive thoughts/worries, sweating of palms, mild social anxiety, constant lingering feeling of slight anxiousness/edginess.
If I'm anxious I'm just generally uptight, but not extreme anxiety in that I dont get a heavy heartbeat or panic attacks, but find myself taking sporadic deep breaths if I'm particularly anxious.
I think my anxiety is a genetic thing as my family all experience anxiety
and I've experienced anxiety my entire teen and adult life. I somehow doubt CBT will work, because my anxiety seems to be present no matter the situation. I've tried and manage to curb the excessive thought somewhat, but the feeling of anxiousness still lingers and the excessive thoughts affect my sleep, I wake up early thinking hard. Exercise helps but its still quite present and I have to exhaust myself to get a good effect from it. I've used weed for the past few years which was great but have built a tolerance toward it, no longer as effective, and its not the best thing to rely upon as a functional medication, affecting you cognitively.

A therapist and doctor both suggested an SSRI but I have my doubts about them: libido effects, addictive potential affecting you if you even miss a day, memory impairment, terrible withdrawal brain zaps and worse feelings afterwards.
I'm not sure my level of anxiety justifies such a drug. I haven't discussed other options with them.

I recently tried alprazolam (a brand called Adco Alzam) for 2 days. I find on about 1-2mg of it a day I'm no longer anxious but normal, my excessive thought patterns disappear and it takes the edginess off and I feel somewhat relaxed but still quite focused, its really great. 

But reading about issues with long term use, tolerance building, cognitive and behavioural effects, sleep effects and withdrawal seizures, I'm concerned.
How pronounced are these? Or are they more apparent in larger doses and in people with more severe anxiety?
How quickly does tolerance develop, would 1-2mg a day or every second day be sustainable for long term? (I'll take it when I feel I need it). What would the withdrawal effects be like on this dosage and usage?
What other options do I have? What about Klonopin?

TL;DR: Mild-moderate non-panic anxiety, worried about long term effects of daily 1-2mg of alprazolam, curious about other options

151,"I've lost all of my friends, online and off, because of anxiety.","The only person I have now is my husband.  
I don't feel that it's fair to him that I rely on him for social interaction (aside from Reddit).  
Mind you, that he doesn't like to be around people either, but he's forced to because he's in the Army.    

I had friends in grade school, until I graduated high school.  
I pushed everyone away and became a recluse, allowing myself to become addicted to the Internet.  
I replaced local friends with online ones (people from MMOs and chat rooms), and made numerous friendships that I thought would last.  
I was very satisfied with online friendships, because I didn't have to deal with face-to-face contact. However, years ago, my anxiety reached a point where I became afraid to interact socially on the web and lost all of those friendships.  
Many of the friendships also died because we all grew up and didn't have time to chat so often. I guess I was the only one who didn't grow up since I can't even leave the house.    

I'm ashamed to rekindle any of them, and fear that too much time has passed.    

My husband has to go away for 3-4 months starting June, and I will be faced with the responsibility of going out and getting things done, which I'm extremely terrified of doing.  
I was able to do all of that when he was in basic training, but I had a vehicle then. Now I live in a place across the country from family and I have no vehicle (we have one that is a stick shift, but I don't know how to drive it). I'll have to take cabs (which is extremely expensive) or ride the bus.       

Can anyone relate to this? Am I just a freaking loser that needs to suck it up? I don't know how else to be. I'm even afraid to go to the doctor to try to get help.  
I pondered if medical marijuana could help me, but I'm too chickenshit to ask my doctor about it. I figured he would look down on me for even asking and think I just wanted to get high. Mind you, I've tried drugs before, but I don't do anything now, and don't want to.  
I've tried anxiety medications, but they only worked for a month or so and required me to take a higher dosage. By the time the meds ran out, I was anxious again and afraid to go to the doctor.    

alksjdflakjsdflkjasdf  
How do you cope? How do you deal? What if you were alone and had no one to talk to?  
I feel like you're going to say ""Get out of the house, even for a little bit a day."" I've done that. I try to get out about twice a week and sit at the park and read. Whenever I try to talk to someone, or someone engages conversation with me, I never know what to say, and stumble through my words, saying the wrong things, or taking to long to think of a response.  
I've tried many things, and always fall back into the same rut.  
The main problem is not having support. That's my problem, and it's my fault for being this way.    

Downvote this all you want. I just wondered if anyone could relate to even a bit of this.",33,2012-04-19 05:41:44 EDT-0400
152,A word to my fellow anxiety sufferers,"It sucks, doesn't it? It's incredible to think that such a simple feeling like anxiety can make you feel so terrible, so hopeless. It's as if you will never escape it, that awful state of mind follows you around like your own shadow. Even when you feel alright, you know it's still there. You know that at any moment it could creep up and paralyze you with fear.


But you know what? You can beat this. You had the power to put the anxious thoughts in your head, and you have just as much power to conquer them. Your mind is just that: yours. You own the anxiety. Every debilitating panic attack, every anxious thought, they're all making you stronger. You're becoming more familiar with yourself; what makes you feel better, what makes you feel worse. All you have to do is try. So many people have beaten it, what makes you think you can't? You can do this. You're GOING to do this. It's going to be hard, but you aren't going to give up. And after you've gotten better, you can look back and realize how much stronger of a person you are for it.

155,Pissed Off at My Anxiety [nsfw: language],"I am a very calm person with tons of patience but today I got pissed off at my anxiety.

I've had anxiety since August 2010 and have been reading and using various non-medication methods.  I do have Xanax (.25mg) for the times that it's bad and I'm down to only needing it about once a month for a really bad day.  Last week, my doctor prescribed Lexapro and last Sunday, I took one 10mg of Lexapro.  Usually the anxiety builds up before a full blown panic attack so I haven't had one since last November because I have learned to control the anxiety.  But that medicine threw me into a panic attack immediately with no anxiety build up.  Along with other side effects, it had me in bed for about 3 days.  I did not take any more of that medicine because 1. my reaction and 2. my doctor told me to stop.

Now that the medicine has fully cleared my system, I wanted to go to Office Depot this morning, my first time driving in a week.  I drive and a block away from the store, I freak and go home.  Then I saw my electricity bill that I have to mail off today.  I put on my jacket again, grab the bill and realize that I cannot walk **one** block to the post office.

After trying my various methods to calm down, I realize today is my once a month day that I will need the Xanax.  I walk into my bedroom where I keep some by the bed (placebo effect makes me sleep well knowing it's close by).  Then I start crying because I don't want to take it. I don't want to rely on medication. I want to be stronger because I know I can overcome this and one day I will be fine.  

Then I got mad.  And I mean pissed off, cursing like a sailor mad.  I throw my jacket on, grab the bill, grab my keys and storm out the door.  The entire time I am stomping down the block, I am cursing under my breath.  This bill HAS to be mailed today.  It's the electric bill.  If the electricity gets turned off because of this damn anxiety, well what the fuck?!  No baseball, no tv, no internet, can't apply for jobs if no internet, can't cook, food will spoil.  Fuck this anxiety!  It's thrown me to the hospital and doctor's office more times in the past 8 months than I've been to see my doctor in the past 10 years!  I had to take a leave of absence from school, I'm thousands in debt (and that is **after** insurance), I finally paid off one ambulance, now I have to work on the second one.  I'm still paying for those doctor visits from last October and many more after.  Fuck you anxiety!  Fuck you.  You're holding me back from going to the store.  I am tired of being in my apartment!  I was able to walk to the library a few days ago.  I went to the post office the other day.  And today you want to rear your ugly head that I can't even go **one** block?!  I AM TIRED OF YOU HOLDING ME BACK.  Fuck you anxiety!  Fuck you brain!

By now I'm passing a group of people for the second time who are standing outside a building.  When I get pass them, I begin to laugh and realize I look like a crazy ass person.  Stomping down the street, face red from crying, cursing under my breath pretty loudly at myself.  Even now, an hour later, I'm still laughing at myself.

I honestly cannot remember the last time I have ever been pissed off. Everything I've read so far has been to be calm, have patience and accept the feelings.  I've been doing that for eight months and I don't know what snapped, but today, I said fuck it, fuck anxiety.

I'm off to Office Depot, because fuck it, I want to use my $5 rewards and get some free stuff and get out the apartment!

159,Success story,"I don't see too many success stories on here compared to questions and problems, so I thought I would share. Treatment can work!

I went through a big illness and a traumatic breakup at the beginning of the year. During this time I had my first real panic attack (woke up in the middle of one, I didn't even know that could happen) and ended up dropping a class because I was so overwhelmed. I was working with a fantastic therapist at the time who suggested I may need medication because all the work we were doing together wasn't helping my anxiety. I saw my doctor and asked what I could do.... I was scared of trying benzos because I was worried I would like them too much, and I was scared to try an anti-depressant because I didn't have enough time to deal with the crazy side effects in the first few weeks. He suggested Paxil, and said at the time ""I bet you will feel this working within a matter of days"". I was skeptical but gave it a shot... it was a low enough dose that I wouldn't need to taper if I hated it. 

Its now been two and a half months on Paxil and my life is so much better. My anxiety is gone... well, not entirely. I still have anxiety over things that ""normal"" people freak out about, but I'm not CONSTANTLY worried about little details and events far into the future. I wake up and feel like I can manage the day, and that I can accomplish great things! It is such a liberating feeling that I can't accurately put into words. 

What actually prompted me to share my story was something I saw on PostSecret today: [this image really struck a chord with me.](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-km8O6sY5Rmo/T4oLwpZb_YI/AAAAAAAAS0U/wLeYbqHx3zU/s400/loveisnotenough.jpg) I think many people can feel like a failure if they have to resort to medication when they shouldn't, especially when people suggest they just ""try harder"" to feel better.

163,Hey,"I feel like talking. This seems like a good place.

I have been struggling with, uh, anxiety, for my whole life, but as I went through college and then started pursuing an advanced degree in physics,  things got way worse and I had to take a long break from school. It's been a couple of years now.

I have been making good progress with this anxiety by talking with one counselor from my university (while I was still enrolled), talking with some religious folks, talking with my girlfriend, surfing, oh and filling many many pages of composition books with all sorts of ideas. I am starting to feel a lot more functional and I am doing OK with the new responsibilities that come with this feeling. I found a new physics advisor and a pretty sweet PhD project is starting to take shape.

Anyways, trying to live more mindfully is tough. When I start to get upset but don't yet understand what is happening, I can come down pretty hard on myself and generally be pretty unpleasant.

Sometimes after a meeting with this new advisor, I find myself ruminating on the subject of physics. This invariably makes me feel bad about myself and makes me feel sick of the subject, which can make it hard for me to go back to my research in the following days.

Yesterday, following a long period of stress, I started feeling like I was coming down with a cold and just found myself really, really upset. Like old times. I think I would benefit from talking with a counselor again. If I can get re-enrolled into my department, I will definitely start with more counseling soon after that. I'm taking it easy today and starting to feel better.

Anyways, I'm working at this and I'm making progress. It is possible to make progress with anxiety. It is not easy on the ego, though. I know in my heart that accepting a more full experience of life has done me and my relationships a great deal of good, despite all the difficult new things I've had to learn.

I am not sure what this community will do with this post, but it felt good to write it and I'm getting tired of just writing to myself.",6,2012-04-18 01:17:46 EDT-0400

165,"/r/Anxiety, what foods make you feel considerably better or worse?","I notice that when I'm not very conscious of it, I tend to eat copious amounts of simple carbohydrates (spoonfuls of nutella, handfuls of sugary cereal, ice cream, candy, etc.), and things very high in protein (maybe to compensate for my feelings of extreme tiredness and discomfort). When I'm a little more conscious of my diet and in a more productive mood, my brain always tends to crave things like wild salmon, avocado, pesto, and dark leafy greens, like spinach. does this happen to anyone else? and it's not even because i think those things are healthier, I just crave them, and when I eat them I feel like I'm less apt to freak out compared to other foods.

I also feel as if the simple carbs make my anxiety worse, and so does consuming anything like tortilla chips, nuts and hummus. they are just as oil-rich and considerably nutrient-dense (excluding the tortilla chips) as the salmon and such, but I feel icky and uncomfortable after consuming them.

EDIT: **also, do you drink an adequate amount of water everyday? or are you often dehydrated?**

I do not drink enough water, and I think it definitely makes me feel cloudy and lethargic. I've never tried staying on top of being well hydrated, but I want to to see if I have a significant upswing.

EDIT: and i'm definitely interested in trying the Keto diet. It seems like it's helpful for anxiety?",23,2012-04-20 03:49:19 EDT-0400

I've tried to yell stop to myself when a thought crosses my mind, and I've also gone on walks or started jogging, yet it doesn't help, and at some points, only makes things worse. I hate total uncertainty, I need to have some idea of what will happen in the future. Since I have no idea what will happen, I'm freaking out, I'm very scared. What are some things I can do to combat the anxiety I face right now, as well as stopping the panic attacks (Alcohol and Smoking cannot be used as a suggestion, TL;DR). Also, I'm conscious of the fact that I am very hard on myself, yet it's so embedded in me, how would I try to tackle this disease head on?

TL;DR Very hard on myself and anxiety about future is complicating things. Having small panic attacks and chest pains. What can I do to stop my anxiety and being hard on myself.",3,2012-04-21 09:19:37 EDT-0400

Have to add a disclaimer- for some people it can be like rubbing salt in a wound, so I'm not recommending it to anyone else and trying to smoke while a panic attack is actually happening is a very bad idea.

Bottom line- if someone offered me choice between a free month's supply worth of benzos or pot, I'd take the green in a heartbeat.     

Edit- thanks all, I kinda figured most people wouldn't have the same experience as me. Hell, herb causes anxiety in plenty of people who don't has any psych issues :)",105,2012-08-20 14:23:33 EDT-0400

191,Constant negative rumination after social interactions with strangers.,"Hi Anxiety Reddit, 

I have had this problem for a really long time. It tends to involve social situations that do not go 100% in my favor. I tend to play out 'what if's' and 'I should've' - what if I said that, what if I did that, I should've said that, I need to stand up for myself more, I need to interject more, I need to be more assertive. It's a constant wheel of repetition. It often last for days. At worst, it's weeks after a single negative social interaction.

This has been an issue since I was a child, and has gotten worse as I've gotten older. I believe my earliest memories of me doing this has been around 1st grade. I believe my issue is related to genetics and bad parenting that contributed to an anxious life style.

**Example 1:** The other day me and my SO went to the local museum and the cashier asked ""Are you a student? Students with their student ID get a discount!"" 

I was a student once at the college listed on my ID. I'm not a student there anymore, graduated with a master's in experimental psychology, working in a neuroscience lab now and taking a few phd level classes elsewhere to see if a phd is up my alley. In any case, I said I was a student and showed the ID of my old school that I still carried in my wallet. 

He says, ""Great! What are you two studying?""

I say, ""Psychology."" I didn't want to ho into detail that I have/pursuing/pursued an advanced degree in psychology. Many people tend to look at me funny or not want to talk to me afterwards. Especially since I live in an area where there isn't a lot of college educated individuals. Sometimes I even get backlash for it. For example, one blue collar guy went on a rant involving, 'So you think you're better than me, huh!?' No, I don't sir, I say. Sometimes, I feel bad mentioning I have an advanced degree where I live. I only feel proud when I can talk about scientific topics to like minded others, where I don't have to be ashamed. My SO says I act ashamed of my intelligence, drive and accomplishments.

My SO says, ""Finance.""

The cashier, ""I hate psychology. That's the worst subject! Finance, I understand that. I don't like psychology. I'd get into analyzing my head and others. I think it's ridiculous. Finance good, Psychology bad...... at least for me."" His speech was in front of a line of people behind me that extended a good 20 feet.

Needless to say, I let his little tirade bug me for the better part of 48 hours. I constantly ruminate on it with things like I should've interjected and been assertive about my field, or mentioned that I'm not a 'lowly undergrad,' as my other grad school friends humorously put it. Other times I just let the event play out in my head like a broken record. I kept hearing, 'psychology is the worst subject!' over and over again. Dedicating six plus years to a craft, science, and knowledge and have someone say that made me a bit upset.

With my educational background and knowing what's going in my head, I should have the power to stop ruminating. I guess it's easier said than done with me. I'm no clinician, perhaps I need professional help. My SO and I conclude that I do fine in stressful big situations (e.g. getting the car stuck in the mud, getting lost in a new york city on vacation), but little social interactions with strangers appear to be my kryptonite.

**Example 2:** I went on a camping trip this year, and I used the utility sink to brush my teeth. As I finish up, I see a guy with a few pots and pans in my periphery. As I leave, I nod to acknowledge his presence. He then says rather aggressively ""UTILITY SINK IS FOR WASHING DISHES!"" I walk away to use the bathroom thinking, wow that guy was a real jerk. Maybe I offended him. I don't know. Maybe I should apologize.

I walk back and pass the utility sink and apologize, ""I didn't know it was only for washing dishes. I'm sorry."" 

The man gruffly says, ""It's alright.""

I probably shouldn't have apologized and went along my business. I don't know. Assertiveness appears to be a weak link in me. I also wish I knew how to interject more. For the next day or so, I played out the situation in my head over and over again with things I could've said, ""A sink's a sink. Why so serious about dish washing…"" Or some various snarky comment. I feel as if I have a great and witty sense of humor. My SO sees it, students I teach see it, my coworkers see it, my friends see it, but others see a weak person to pick on I feel. If only I had the courage to say such things to break the ice or tension. Instead, I opted to buy a few assertiveness training books on my kindle and read them for hours on end until I fell asleep in my tent.

I'm still not that assertive after reading those books.

**Example 3:** My boss was training me to use a new piece of equipment in the lab. Halfway through the training session, I absent mindedly placed a hand to lean on a very expensive piece of equipment that was in the lab. Roughly $5k.

He says very quickly, ""Don't lean on that!""

I looked down embarrassed, and quickly jerked my hand back. ""Oh yeah…"" As i said looking at the floor with a shy smile. Yeah…. the expensive piece of equipment, forgot about that.

He just laughed and continued with his speech and training.

I kept playing out the thoughts, geez I just blew a promotion that's terrible! I dwelled on that for a day or so. Once again, I should said something funny, ""Oh just testing the sturdiness!"" I missed that opportunity. 

-----------

These are all recent examples. I gave tons of speeches and presentations at school or at conferences, and I never really dwelled on things as much after the fact. I guess because I had almost complete control during speeches. Interactions are a ever flowing dialog, analogous to an ever changing organism. I have little control over them.

I also have this inner urge to express my masculinity, but not to offend. I feel so conflicted. I want to punch somebody, but I know I can't. I want to berate somebody with swear words or just belittle them, but I know that's not right. To the dude in example one, I wish I could brag about all my accomplishments, educate him in some way, and perhaps even yell… but I feel conflicted to do so. So I try to let it go, but instead I just quietly take it and ruminate and hate my life for the next couple of days until the memory slowly dissipates. 

I feel as if I was **(1) more assertive (2) less ruminative (3) learn the ability to interject instead of waiting for them to finish saying something relevant to me...** I would then lead a more fulfilling life I believe. It's all easier said than done. Even my boss/mentor in graduate school mentioned I need to stop being so passive and agreeable. It is a problem, that I wish I could stop. 

Is there any advice you can give? Should I seek professional help? Are there books you recommend? Do you recommend supplements for this type of anxiety and rumination? I'm not ready for prescription drugs. What type of anxiety would this fit under, anxiety experts? GAD? Social Anxiety? I'm thinking Social Anxiety, right?",12,2012-08-20 01:32:54 EDT-0400
192,"So, I had a job interview today, and woke up this morning more nervous that I have been in a while","I woke up this morning, drenched in cold sweats. My heart was racing, my thoughts were jumbled, and all I wanted to do was go back to bed and forget about the whole thing. Make up an excuse for why I couldn't make it. 

Fortunately, I had different plans in mind. I woke up, drank some water, took a small dose of Ativan, and started getting ready. My stomach was still in complete knots, so I grabbed something light to eat and waited until it was time to go. Waiting is a horrible thing for me, I hate having to wait for something (anything) because it makes me incredibly anxious of the outcome. 

I can finally feel the effects of the Ativan taking a small hold on me. My nauseousness has gone down, but I still just want to go back to bed and forget about the whole thing. Forget about the job interview, if I do good that means that I'll have to start working again, which means that I could possibly get fired for anxiety, which mea- 'Stop.' I said. 'That's enough. This is what I want, this is what I need right now. This is a perfect opportunity, and if I don't go for it, if I let it slide past me like so many others, nothing will be different'. 

I got in my car, and drove 15 minutes to the store I applied at. I met the manager, a really nice, easy-going guy. He walked me around the store (my eyes still focusing on the exit once in a while), and asked me a few questions about what I like to do, where I would like to work in the store, and what I would be doing. It sounded perfect, I would be doing light stocking and cashiering, perfect for someone in my situation. Not stressful, but also a perfect way to open up and start dealing with my anxiety in a more productive and healthy manner. 

After the short interview, he told me that he liked my appearance, the way I presented myself, and that he would be hiring me. I have to call back tomorrow morning to confirm everything with him and get the process moving along. After shaking his hand and leaving the store, I felt like the king of the world. I drove home with a huge smile on my face, and I felt my happiness and excitability taking over my anxiety. It's been about an hour since that happened, now I'm sitting on the computer, relaxed (although I have a bit of a residual adrenaline rush from earlier, hah). 

What did I have to be worried about? Nothing, really. I knew it was going to turn out good. But I worry anyway. I'm hoping that this will be an opportunity for me to learn not to worry about what may be. I'm hoping that this job will help me get at least a small social aspect of my life going, and start freeing my mind from the barbed-wire fences that contain it and my anxiety. Am I still nervous about this job? Definitely. It's the first time I've worked in 2 years. Am I going to hide away from it, ignore all the calls back, and just try again in another year? No. I'm going to try my hardest. If it doesn't work out, that's okay, but at least I tried. I didn't sit on my computer day in and day out, I tried something, and it worked out.

194,Negative thinking is not preparedness.,"Anyone else struggle to remember this? In times of high stress, I have a tendency to imagine the worst-case scenario, as though that would somehow make me better prepared for the worst-case scenario. It. Never.

On the occasions when I have envisioned the best possible outcome, it has nearly always led to me not only feeling better about the entire process, but the results are often far better than my negative thinking would have ever allowed me to believe was possible.

I'm curious if other people have experienced this. I'm finding that negative thinking is still tripping me up when demands are exceptionally high, or my resources (sleep, food, medication) are low. I want to start getting back up faster when challenges are thrown in my path, and start reaping the benefits of my positive thinking more often.",13,2012-08-15 09:09:37 EDT-0400

197,Just a story about me going to the grocery store,"   Today I am going to the grocery store. This makes me very very anxious. I don't know why my anxiety acts up when I go to the store and it is very frustrating. I feel like a am going to throw up. I feel faint, my chest feels like it is on fire. My palms sweat and my heartbeat excelerates. I don't know how to control this
    I feel like the world is out to get me. I worry that they won't have a certain item that I'm looking for, I'm worried I won't have enough money for the food. I worry about stupid things. I have to physically and mentally prepare myself to go to the market. This angers me. I want to be normal. Why can't I be normal?
I used to go to the store and do just fine. I don't know what made me act like this but I can't control it. I want this to end! I'm fed up. I mean it's not something I can just avoid. I have to have food to survive. I wish I could be anxious about something else that I actually could avoid like going to the mall, or flying in an airplane. But no
it has to be this one thing that I used to enjoy doing. I love food. I used to love to shop for it.  
 I don't know what snapped in me that made me like this. I wasn't this bad before. It's like my brain doesn't have anything better to do so it just sits around and tells me to worry about nonsense. Who cares if Aldis is out of avacados? You can just get some 
at Wal- mart. I tell my brain this but it never listens. Hell, I never used to worry about grocery stores not having a specific item, what the fuck happened? My brain just wants me to get worried over something irrational. I have always went to the store and bought avacados.    
I have never seen them run out of avacados. But my brain wants me to worry
about fucking avacados! I wouldn't wish this shit on anybody. It's like having mental cancer. Your sanity is slowly being eaten away and you wonder why the hell an I worried about this? I don't understand and I probably never will. I can't eat right anymore. I can't sleep. Everything just stresses me out. My hair is falling out and I have these awful headaches 
all the damn time. I can just see it now. I wake up. I tell myself I have to go to the grocery store today. The nausea and sweaty palms start to set it. My heart feels like it is going to pound out of my chest. Most people would probably feel this way about normal stuff like going to the prom for the first time. Losing your virginity or having to make a
speech. But for me this happens everytime I go to the grocery store. I put on my clothes. I grab the list. I slowly make my way up the stairs. I probably dry heave a couple of times and I haven't even made it out the door. I wait for the person taking me to the grocery to get ready since I don't drive. I pace around frantically. Finally I get into the car. I buckle my seatbelt.
Annnnnd we're off!. I try listening to the radio to get my mind off of the situation I'm in. I grip the door handle tightly. We are getting very close now. We are at the stoplight that's next to the store. I see it staring at me. I don't want to go in but I have to.We get to the parking lot. I feel like death. We stop and the engine shuts off. My legs feel like jello. Welp here goes nothing.
I walk up to the automatic doors and they open. I feel like I am stepping into the depths of hell. I frantically make my way to the first item on my list. I probably dry heave a little more. I continue on to the next item. By this time my anxiety wanes just a bit. I just tell myself to keep going. Before I know it I am done. You can call me stupid and dumb for being like this
but let me tell you that anxiety is very real and you should never judge a person with anxiety. What seems like a menial task to one person could be like trying to jump across the Grand Canyon to another.

TL:DR I get very anxious going to the grocery store and it's fucking annoying",9,2012-08-16 09:07:48 EDT-0400
198,Something happened to me 9 months ago and I am still having anxiety over it.,"This is my first time posting and I thought this would be the best place to start. I need some advise. Thanks.

Last November, I went to hawaii on a business/vacation trip. While there I had a rental car and had gotten the full insurance on it. One afternoon I was drive back to the Office on my day off and I was entering and intersection and could not see that traffic was stopped in the intersection. I stop short and rear ended an older van. Going about 5 mph. We pulled over and inspected our cars. I have a bent license plate and some missing paint. His bumper was slightly bent in. He look at me and said to not worry about it. I asked him if he was sure he did not want to call it in. He said no. I shook his hand and we when our separate ways.

I still reported to the rental car company and told them what happened. They said because I had the insurance that they would handle everything and notify me if anything arises. 

Since that day I have been so paranoid that this guy is going to come after me, report me to the police as a hit and run or something like that. The rental car company is going to forget to notify me and That I am going to have a warrant out for my arrest and I am going to end up in jail. I keep checking to see if I can find anything, by checking driving records and what not.

Lately the anxiety has been getting worse and I have not slept more then a few hours a night the last 2 weeks. I feel like it happened yesterday and/or my worries came true when nothing has happened.

206,This Anxiety Nausea is the Worst,"Hi guys, I am here because Reddit is such an amazing resource. But lately in the last few weeks I have had nothing but constant anxiety attacks.

It usually is a thought or a minor discomfort, and the next thing I know, my stomach is set to vomit. I try to minimize the risk with mints or gum which help plenty in a social environment. I also try to carry around Pepto, which placebo or not in this circumstance should help.

I am just trying to say, is there anything I can do to alleviate this, or will I always feel worried sick in public? Its been sporadic throughout my whole life. 

But the worst part is once you feel sick, there is no going back. Its all in my head, and my head is sabotaging me. I can hardly eat sometimes because of a minor discomfort causes me to worry, causing nausea, and a full fledged panic attack. 

I really don't want to have to go back to my Celexa, I tried to make it so long with out it, but I think that was my only help to the anxiety. Until then, I have neurontin which should help. I am prescribed 2 100mg pills 3x daily, so I am hoping taking that more consistently would help. 


I just really want to know if there is any advice? This is the worst feeling for me and it so depressing to feel nothing but sickness while the rest of the world enjoys strolling around carefree and having fun, while I am constantly worried about vomiting. 

Sorry for the long post, I cannot sleep because of this damn anxiety I got just typing this letter out.

212,"[A Thank You] Used to get anxious and feel depressed at work, but after reading peoples posts here I have been panic free for nearly 2 months!","I was working in a stressful profession that made me sleep deprived and lose weight from not eating right. I would have either a mini or full-blown panic attack everyday and come home at night to my SO feeling like I was in a deep, dark hole that I was stuck in with no daylight. The money was amazing and would have set me up for life but I couldn't handle what it was doing to my health.
After reading peoples advice about similar issues here on this subreddit, and paying attention to what advice people had to give and spending some time talking out my issues with a professional (as which gets recommended here a fair bit!) I took the time to re-evaluate my life.
It was difficult, I was unemployed for about 6 months, doing job trials at places which made me feel ill (and not show up for on some occasions) But for the past 2 months I have found work in an industry in which I had no experience in, but has made me feel so comfortable with my life now and has given me the inspiration to create a new life goal for myself which I hope to achieve within the next 5 years.

213,What helps you to ease your anxiety the most?,[deleted],27,2012-09-01 19:05:05 EDT-0400
214,Successful Treatment for Anxiety/Depression:  Follow-up to my earlier posts. ,"I am a former sufferer of generalized anxiety disorder.  I am cured.  I have anxiety on occasion, sure, but it is no longer interfering with my quality of life.  I also feel that my anxiety now results from situations where anxiety is an appropriate response, as opposed to the type of overreactions that anxiety-disorders create.

There seems to be a split on this forum between people who understand that there are successful therapy modalities for anxiety and those who either do not understand or think that they are different - that they have a type of anxiety or mind that cannot respond to treatment.  Having never actually tried treatment, it's hard to say that's  correct. 

In any event, I am continuing my attempt to get as many of you aware of the **empirical research** into successful treatments for anxiety disorders of all types - social, phobias, GAD, panic attacks, etc.  

**MINDFULNESS AND ACCEPTANCE BASED INTERVENTIONS**:  A meta analysis of nineteen studies found that ""MABIs are associated with robust and substantial reductions in symptoms of anxiety and comorbid depressive symptoms.""  Available here:  http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22803933

Another meta- analysis found similar results:  http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20350028

Other studies have been less optimistic, but it appears to be a good complement to another approach, Cognitive Behavioral Therapy.  http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20488270

**COGNITIVE BEHAVIORAL THERAPY**:  Consistently found to have significant effects on anxiety.  It seems, however, to depend on the ability of the individual therapist to use it well.  I know from personal experience, as well, that CBT is a rather involved process that requires good direction from your therapist, and a bad therapist can get hung up and be unable to modify the approach slightly.  

""In conclusion, CBT appears to be both efficacious and effective in the treatment of anxiety disorders, but more high-quality studies are needed to better estimate the magnitude of the effect.""  http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22275847

""Although the specific components of CBT differ depending on the study design and the anxiety disorder treated, meta-analyses suggest that CBT procedures (particularly exposure-based approaches) are highly efficacious.""  http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20599133


Having gone through CBT with two therapists and by using a helpful book, and reading portions of a training manual and textbook, I have a decent handle on it, although I am not a therapist and cannot claim to be able to cure anyone.  I am always available to answer questions about how it works and why I think it helps, from my personal experience. ",14,2012-09-07 20:57:47 EDT-0400
215,"I figured something out.  Something very discouraging, frustrating, and is possibly my downfall.","I rely on people, because I have agoraphobia.  It traps me, and I just have to sit and take it.  Examples:

Shrink
Tried Paxil twice 40mg and 60mg
Tried Lexapro 20mg
Tried Zoloft, had to quit because of twitches
Tried Effexor 350mg
Tried Anafranil 175mg

All helped my OCD and GAD.  None helped my panic even somewhat.  Most gave me very severe depression.  My treatment goal overall is to get rid of the panic so I can get out of the house.  Drugs that boost serotonin are obviously not working.  Yet I was just prescribed another.  

And why do I take it?  Because I have agoraphobia and my choices of psychiatrists are limited because they won't come to my house or do phone appts.  I found one who will, and I have to just do whatever he says.  As an aside, Klonopin works a little.  It works a lot if I take more than I should.  but I just do what he says because he's the only game in town for me.

Work
I take what I can get because I can only work from home.  I take jobs that are not consistent with someone at my stage of my career.  I take insults and accusations.  I sometimes get paid well, and many times work well under scale, and well under what I should make for two decades of experience.  Because I have no choice.

I do a lot of things in my life because I have few choices.  I can't fire my shrink.  I can't quit my contracts and work on something better, more fulfilling or where I'm respected in any significant way, despite how good I am and how much experience I have.

I'm trapped.

I'm not going to be trapped anymore.  I can't cure my agoraphobia.  I can't seem to change my career.  My options are few.",34,2012-09-06 10:32:57 EDT-0400

217,Why?  Because I'm disgusted at what I've become.  And people don't get that.,"I don't know if this belongs here or in /r/depression or here, so I'm posting it in both places.

20-30 years of anxiety and depression have taken its toll.  Apathy has taken over.

I was a musician, and I appreciate that it saved my life by taking me away from my home town, and away from people who have either wound up dead or in jail.  And since I quit music, some of those who I played with have likewise wound up in prison or addicted.  And at 44, it's been decades since I was inspired to play.

I'm a web developer of some 17+ years, and I appreciate the money it provides and feel fortunate to have it, but I really don't like doing it.  It seems so vapid and meaningless.  I feel like I had more to give at one point and I went for the money.

I could change careers, but I have no idea what to do.

Of my friends who are not in jail or dead, their numbers have gotten fewer.  I have a few I talk to now and then.  I have a relationship, but she doesn't understand and I'm always doing or saying something wrong.  I love her, but I haven't been able to do right by her.

I'm agoraphobic and have been housebound for almost 6 years.  Before that, I had addictions, anxiety, panic disorder, GAD, OCD, depression.  I'm clean now except what my doctor gives me, and the antidepressants haven't ever done enough, and I've been on a lot and on high doses.

I think about disappearing and leaving everyone alone and not bothering them anymore.  Other times I think about suicide, although I can't do it.  Sometimes I think about it every day for weeks or months.

Many of those around me think I have the ability to control this myself.  I can't.  I wish I could.

I feel used up.  I feel like I've tried enough drug and non-drug therapies that something should have worked by now.

I don't know what to do from here.

I started a new job recently and as with any stressful situation I get loose bowels before hand. I took anti diarheals before work each day for the first week which isnt a big deal as it is something that always affected me before the anxiety issues. Usually after a couple of days I wouldnt need to once I settled into a job

Its now my third week and I have only had one day when I didnt take them to deal with the anxiety of soiling myself. I had been improving but last night I had legitimate diarrhea ( I never get the IBS while I am at home) and now I am terrified of going into work.

221,Typing this and realising I'm more messed up than I thought I was. Help?,"A little background info: 19 years old, female.
I have struggled with depression, and what I now know to be anxiety, for six or so years. Around six months ago, my GP prescribed me celexa/citalopram and I have taken that daily since. My parents have fought since the dawn of time and have had two major split ups that I recall. They live separately (except on weekends) but since a lot of drama happened in 2011, this year, they have worked really hard to like each other again and are sort of back together. They're both alcoholics. There's been a few instances of domestic violence, one ending in my mother nearly bleeding to death and needing her arm stitched up after ""punching"" or ""falling through"" a glass door (wow, this sounds so bad now that I'm writing it), plus I've called the cops on them twice and once they were both arrested - leaving me in-charge of my younger brother for the rest of the night. My father is controlling but it's almost like he has more than one personality, My mother is caring to the point of naivety (with my father anyway), same thing with the polar personalities. We're comfortable with money.

**What I want to know is:** I think I have something more than just common depression and social anxiety. How do I go about... finding out whether I do or not? Or is this ""I'm not normal"" feeling just a product of low self-esteem and my unstable upbringing? If so, what can I do to fix it?

I can't always access my feelings or memories. Even with this post, it's taking some time to remember why I've wanted to ask for help. Even though I may not always remember why, I feel like I'm ""damaged goods"" in a way.

I always need approval of someone else; I get jealous when I don't get complimented and someone else does; I don't know what a ""normal family"" is; I've had cycles of long depression and then had a short period of feeling normal; I self-harmed every now and then, started doing it nearly daily at the end of last year, recently became clean as of a few months ago; not suicidal anymore but have been in the past.

**tl;dr -** I think this has just turned into a big rant about my life and wanting someone to understand how I'm feeling and tell me *why*. Any advice is extremely appreciated.",19,2012-09-02 19:42:02 EDT-0400

223,"If I try to just close my eyes & go to sleep, I'll have an anxiety attack. I am basically distracting myself as best I can until I just pass out from exhaustion. I know this isn't acceptable. But what do I do? Anxiety controls *everything*.","Despite a night regimen of Lunesta, Roprinerole, Clonidine, Prpranolol, Oxazepam, Hydromorphone AND OxyContin (all under direction of my pain management specialist) I am still awake 5 hours later.


Despite feeling tired, even that tightness in the eyes, I can't just close them and wait for sleep. It takes the average person 7.5 minutes to fall asleep (my husband, 1.67) and that roughly 7 minutes would just be time for my brain to start freaking out. I could even be almost asleep and anxiety will wash over me, connecting my body head to toe in a tingling sensation accompanied by acute stomached pain, then panic, despair, and hopelessness. How can I ever peacefully fall asleep?


Every night it's the same thing: I take my meds and wait to pass out, mid paragraph of whatever I'm reading. The night like this, when sweet escape doesn't come within a half hour, as it should, are misery.


Then I'm up all hours, so I sleep all day, I end up with a wasted day, an anxiety trigger, and a cycle begins, at least until the meds ""work"" swiftly enough some subsequent night.


I try daydreaming myself to sleep, but all it takes is one hint of a trigger and my whole body is alert again.


This is maddening.


What can I do? Besides Ambien and Restoril, is there another sleeping pill I could ask about?


I see my prescribing doctor for my monthly visit tomorrow. Actually I'm afraid to tell him the Lunesta's not working. What if he has no advice? What if he tries to send me to a sleep clinic? 


But I can't live like this. When I want to sleep, I can't, and when I should be awake, all I do is sleep. ARGH.

226,Religious/Loss of belief anxiety,"I am 19 and I was born into a strong Christian family. My parents were very loving and did not emphasize a negative, brimestone and hellfire type of belief, however, the concept of going to hell was always there. After going off the college I began opening my mind to a lot of new things and since last summer I have been obsessing over choosing the right religious belief to subscribe to. I went through a Buddhist/mindfulness phase which brought me a good amount of happiness. However, as of the past few months I started thinking more and more about Christianity and hell.

 Logically I feel like my fears of hell and the afterlife in general are not rational, yet I always have that little voice that says ""what if?"". I get scared that maybe God is not a good guy and most people will be tortured forever and I especially freak out when I start to imagine the length of an eternity in pain or loneliness. I often resort to trying to force myself to believe in a lie just in order to secure myself in case the bible stories are true.

I feel like many redditers may have had these fears, considering the amount of ex-christians here, so I am hoping for some words of wisdom. Deep down I feel like this is all irrational, but I don't know how to deal with this. In all reality I lean toward agnostic deism, but I am afraid to officially deconvert. Thanks for listening.

**TL;DR: Born in a strong Christian family, would rather be agnostic in my beliefs but I am afraid to deconvert due to my irrational fears of going to hell for eternity.**",14,2012-01-03 07:14:38 EST-0500
227,Social Anxiety - seeking advice on dealing with an immature guy.,"I was diagnosed with social anxiety disorder as a teen and have worked very hard to overcome it. I dropped out of school repeatedly from middle - high school to avoid large crowds, I've had very few friends and I hold what friends I have to high esteem. I'm in my late 20's now and I recently got involved with a man who I thought was nice at the time, we used to be friends, lost contact, reconnected, then we dated, then we talked about our future, then he told me he didn't want to be with me. I've dealt with it fine, we have been talking like friends lately, last night while talking online he mentioned how I was obsessed with him. I told him not to flatter himself... I've heard through the grapevine that now he's dating a neighbor of mine and telling people who don't know me that I'm crazy. It's all because I mentioned in passing that for a time period where we lost contact with each other I would think of him sometimes (he used to have depression and was suicidal at one point, of course I thought about him and worried about him). He thought that it was a sweet sentiment at the time, but now he's using that as a basis of me being obsessed with him...

I never did anything to him and it's making me shut down again. He even tried to make me doubt my sanity.


I just wish I could find a way to convey to him that he's being immature and it's not fair to me to tell people who don't know me these things about me. I'm just really upset and now I'm becoming more reclusive, especially since he could now be telling neighbors lies about me. I live in a pretty tight-knit neighborhood. I'm worried and paranoid and I am losing sleep at night. I don't think this is fair.

230,At the tail end of a relatively severe panic attack right now...,"I just wanted to vent while I have the chance.  I've known anxiety for the past six or seven years now, and I can attest to the fact that it can be pure, unadulterated hell on its face, but as we can all freely admit during our calmer days, it's an embarrassingly empty threat.  That is why I'm writing this now--because I've decided that this time, I'm hanging on to it.  I'm going to grab this thing by the throat and I'm putting it in the corner, and I'm not letting go again until I'm gone.  I'm going to go the anger route and I'm going to go with a vengeance.  I'm tired of getting over it--the lingering agoraphobia, convincing myself after a few weeks that I can quit with the preventive, burdensome lifestyle because I've once again defeated it--without remembering what it did to me.  How truly helpless it made me feel.  Not for one more day will I ever again let it slide out the back door just because I'm too happy to care.  Anxiety and happiness cannot coexist, but that's only because anxiety can't handle it.  From now on when I'm happy and worry free, I'm going to turn around and show this thing what it's kept from me; all the good days that it's ruined.  It doesn't deserve a free pass again this time.  From now on, I'm getting even.

On average, I would say I have a panic attack worth remembering about once a year.  Tonight was a pretty damn bad one.  Tomorrow is going to be a pretty damn good one.  It had better be ready for me.",3,2012-01-04 12:20:44 EST-0500
231,How to deal with feeling like crap - a lot.,"I have a panic and general anxiety disorder. I was diagnosed about 2 years ago now, right before I got married. I've never figured out what my 'trigger' is, but my doctor believes it could be performance based, or a fear in failing. 

Over the course of the last 2 years, I think I've had every test imaginable. Yet - I still struggle with the physical side effects of having these disorders and the hardship in other people not really understanding what my problem is. 

I suffer from frequent headaches, head pains, chest pains and stomach trouble. I rarely take off work, because I always just 'assume' it's my anxiety. Which is good, I'm not letting it rule me... but it's still there. I often find myself sighing because of how I always feel 'not right'. 

My wife is a great friend, and she understands that I feel what I feel and it's hard to control but some days I worry that because sometimes I'm hands off she will get tired of my worrysome ways and I'll lose my best friend because of my problems.

I took medicine for a while, but even she agreed that taking something with side effects that also make you feel physical symptoms is not the best idea for me. It made me more anxious.

I guess I'm just asking for a shoulder. People who have had anxiety disorders without a known trigger with physical symptoms - how do you convince yourself you are actually okay ? 

For me, even thinking something may be wrong is a trigger to anxiety and everything just gets worse.",9,2012-01-03 21:45:30 EST-0500
232,Anxiety while driving,"So I was driving to go meet a friend today and it was a farther drive than I'm use to (though I made it a lot during the summer) I was a little nervous before hand. At first I was ok, still a little nervous but getting over it, but after a while on the highway I found it was difficult to breathe and then I just got big pins and needle fuzzy sensation in my body, my heart start racing and some other stuff I feel during a panic attack. So I get off of the highway get some beef jerky and water at a party store and the entire time I was shaking, feeling jittery and just crappy in general. 

After eating some food and having some water I felt better, but as soon as I started driving it started happening again but to a lesser extent, though at one point my vision started to get a little fuzzy. I've never pass out before but this all feels like how I would imagine it would feel like just before. 

This also isn't the first time this has happened. I had a similar experience last week while trying to drive to the mall on the highway. Both times I never last long than 10mins on the road. Also to give some back ground, I go to school out of state where I don't have a car. I'm home for christmas so this is the first time I have had a car to drive in several months. But I don't think this has much to do with the panic attacks as I didn't have a car last year and when I came back from school for the summer I was fine driving. What makes this worse is that I was gifted the old family car for christmas and was suppose to drive back to school with it instead of taking the train. Now I can't drive it on the highway (which is necessary for me to get back to school) and I won't be able to get a job this summer (or get a job that pays even slighty above minimum wage before summer) if I can't drive. I'm going to try to find help back up at school for this, but please comment.",11,2012-01-04 21:47:14 EST-0500

234,Anxiety about meeting up with ex-gf,"I am an anxiety suffererer. I have been for a while. I'm about 5 years removed from college, where in my senior year I started developing bad anxiety with the physical symptoms. Headaches, shaking, stomach aches, chest pains/discomfort, etc. I probably always have had anxiety as it does run in my family, but this is when it got bad. 

Fast forward to a few months ago. My girlfriend decided to part ways because she was tired of the way I was acting around her. I let her know I had anxiety, but I really wasn't doing much about it and it looked like I was disinterested. I don't blame her, honestly. I probably didn't need to have a gf at that point in time, anyway. 

What I realized in the time since is that she is the perfect girl (for me, at least) and I basically let a good thing slip away. Life was rough for a bit after the break-up, but I was starting to be able to manage my emotions. Thing is, I could not stop thinking about her and what could have been. When things were good with her, they were *good*. I decided to randomly email her a week ago or so and she got back to me in about 4 hours. She was so happy to hear from me and wants to grab dinner.

She texted me on New Year's eve hoping I had some fun things planned and what not and wished me a Happy New Year. I texted her back about an hour later and thanked her and wished her the same. I did not realize it until the next day, but she actually texted me at 2AM. ""Joooooooosh!"" she said, but that's all. She was in a different state visiting her family at that time, so it's not like we could have met up or anything. What could that have possible meant? She was thinking about me, I know, but anything else?

I emailed her a couple of days ago and told her that I would love to grab dinner and said a couple of nice things. She gave me the greenlight. We exchanged a few texts yesterday and she actually sent me a gchat today to just double verify the plans and we had a nice little convo.

So, we are going out next Wed. night and I pretty much want to spill my guts to her. I have a ton of anxiety as I do not want to mess this up at all. Do you guys have any idea what this could all mean and what can I do to alleviate my anxiety?

tl;dr I have anxiety and am having dinner with the ex gf soon. Should I get my hopes up? How do I combat this associated anxiety?",2,2012-01-06 23:36:52 EST-0500

238,I need advice for telling my wife it's time for meds,"Hi. My wife has GAD and has tried the non-medication route for about 2 years(6 months of actually being diagnosed). We have had an incredibly difficult time making any kind of progress, and her dr and therapist both think that medication may help break a downward spiral. 

She has also asked me to be honest with her and let her know if I think she needs to start medication. 

So I had planned a kind of intervention for tomorrow, basically wrote her a letter with my reasoning, and was planning on reading it to her. It says it's my opinion, but ultimately her decision. 

However, she has gotten a bad cold. Should I wait until she feels better? My concern is that between anxiety related physical symptoms, and cold season, that may not be for a long time. 

Also, I have really psyched myself up for this, as I know it is going to be difficult.

In a few hours I'm moving back to my student house and I'm just having a huge anxiety attack about going back.  This week is a relatively slow week, as its the first week of school, and one of my triggers for anxiety is lots of spare time.  I also get anxiety during changes (like moving from here to there), and from being isolated/or just feeling isolated.  My SO who I live with is working this term full time, so he will be gone all day during the week, which normally is no big deal, but going back in to this term I am just having huge anxiety attacks and I can't calm myself down.

I'm on pristiq and wellbutrin, and I have ativan for emergency use but I try to avoid using it.

I just finished what will hopefully be my last cigarette, but I'm really nervous about the whole withdrawal process. I've tried to quit before, and usually end up getting really anxious/panicky around the 12 hour mark which then has always led to me giving in and buying another pack.

245,Need help with Boyfriend's weight anxiety,"My boyfriend and I spent most of the last few months partying pretty hard. He has a history of anxiety in his family and has had success with focusing on weight/exercise, and with all this partying he gained some weight.

Now he has nearly weekly freak outs about his weight, absolutely certain he is obese and disgusting but aware that is how he feels and not how other people see him. But he also gets convinced that I am only with him because I have to be and that there is no way I could want to have sex with him. He consistently freaks out at me about helping him work out because he lacks motivation to do it himself and that I need to help him do it. I cook us super healthy fresh vegetarian food and I support him not drinking and not eating crap, even giving up a lot of that myself so it's not in the house as a temptation.

Here's the thing though, I have anxiety around feeling really guilty I don't like working out. I've had panic attacks in the past and I know exercise will help, but I get really anxious about working out. I like doing cardio in the house and would be really in to a yoga or dance class if I could afford it (it has worked in the past) but I don't have the scrilla. I want to help him, but I think that he needs to get over a lot of this anxiety before losing weight is actually going to help.

How do I help him without throwing myself in to the anxiety spiral? I have only tried to talk to him about this when he's text panicking and that's never helpful. I know we need to talk it out, but when he's calm he never wants to take it seriously.

I don't know. Maybe this is just venting. But I hate feeling like I can't live up to what he needs and also hate being what he hangs all that on. How do I tell him that and stay supportive?

TL:DR Boyfriend has anxiety around weight, I have anxiety around exercise. How do we help each other?",1,2012-01-06 23:26:33 EST-0500
246,"I think I have a serious problem, yet paralyzed with fear...","To break it down, I have depression and generalized anxiety disorder. I'm supposed to take Klonopin, but I took too many at a time and my bottle has ran out. I'v been without it for like two weeks since I didn't want to go to the doctor way early to ask for another script. So like two weeks of twice as much as I need, two weeks of none. Not good.

For years one of my eyes has been blurry occasionally, I thought nothing of it. This year I got optic neuritis, which makes you blind in one eye. I was supposed to get an MRI, but didn't. Doctors didn't say it could be tumor, but more likely MS if anything.

But, my dad and grandfather both had tumors. I check online. Horrible, horrible mistake. Optic nerve problems? Yeppers. Flashing lights? Sometimes. Ringing in ears? Sometimes. Headaches...

All signs of brain tumor. So I'm convinced I have a brain tumor. If I get my mind off of it, I'm okay. But say I do hear the ringing. I get so scared. 

I drive my poor boyfriend nuts talking about how I'm going to die. He asks why not go to the doctor. So I say, you think I have it? I try to make him swear to me I don't have cancer or a tumor. It's an unrealistic demand. Nobody can tell me, I have to go to the doctor.

I'm too scared to even say  the words to the doctor as if vocalizing it will solidify it. I tell myself I don't wanna know, I don't wanna know. I'm okay. I'm okay. I'm okay. Then seconds later BUT IF YOU'RE DYING DON'T YOU WANT TO CATCH IT EARLY. But what if it's not early and I've waited too long. My eye is so blurry now.

So I play these games in my head and torture myself. Just go to a doctor, right? 

I just need to vent because I had a panic attack tonight. I shook and my teeth chattered and I was talking like a crazy person.

I just want to be healthy, and no I'm healthy. I just want someone to say it's okay! It's okay sanmari55, you're going to live a long and healthy life.

A doctor could say that, or, you have 6 months to live.

And I'm shaking and my jaws clattering and I have a headache (tumor) and everyone thinks I'm crazy.

Maybe the tumor is making me ultra crazy?

And the panic continues and all I can do is type like crazy.

Tl;dr I was supposed to have an MRI, and have factual information that I might have a tumor. But I'm too afraid to see a doctor.",2,2012-01-07 10:36:27 EST-0500

252,I'm sick of feeling like this. Big changes start tomorrow.,"I'm so tired of my anxiety controlling me. I'm at the point where I'm just constantly angry with myself for allowing my life pass me by. I want to be successful and happy and I'm so fed up with the strangle hold my anxiety has on my life. Last week was tough. I won't go into the details, but suffice to say that all the things I have been avoiding finally piled up and created one massive, unavoidable problem. My anxiety was so bad I couldn't get out of bed. I'm done living like this. 

Tomorrow I have my first real appointment with my counselor (I've already met with him for the initial assessment). I'm shocked that I'm not feeling anxious about it. I'm actually kind of excited (what?!). I just want my life back, and this is the first step. 

Other than seeing a counselor bi-weekly, I'm finally going to start doing the things I know help me with my anxiety. I've always known these things help me, but I always seem to allow my anxiety to stop me from doing them (vicious cycle). These things include:

1. Exercising (daily)
2. Keeping a daily planner
3. Keeping my apartment tidy, and specifically, making my bedroom a calming and meditative environment
4. Sticking to a routine (e.g, having a routine for before I go to bed every night and doing it the same every night. this had been really helpful for me in the past, but like I said, I sabotage myself by saying ""oh, I'm too stressed to do that tonight"" when I know that not doing it will only make me more stressed) 
5. Reading (every night)

I've made these promises to myself before, but I've always let my anxiety get the better of me. I really want a better life. I'm not going to let my anxiety destroy another relationship or opportunity. I'm scared, but I'm finally going to take control.",20,2012-04-10 06:53:10 EDT-0400

255,It's the small things that help me see I've taken little steps in the right direction," 
I am a 20 year old female student struggling with anxiety (social anxiety)I thought I'd share some changes I've seen in my life. It's far from over, But I know I've come a long way with my social anxiety. 

I used to never be able to leave my house unless someone was with me. I lost so many beautiful days to anxiety. 

I developed an eating disorder at 10 years old because of social anxieties and fought with it until the beginning of college.

Teachers and councilors thought I was mute up until high school.

I lost my only friend because of my clingyness. Depending on her for so much must have been a heavy burden. Seeing her in the streets truly embarrasses me- I was such a horrible friend. 

I hated myself so much. I cut, starved, and puked because of who I was. I would sleep on the bathroom, garage, or attic floor and ended up with lice at 15 years old.  
I was a disappointment and budren for my mother. 

I never once talked to my college roommates, instead I locked myself in my room and wasted those beautiful days away. 

I would take sleeping pills to make the time go by faster. 

I think one of my lowest points was when one of the roommates had friends over. I had to go to the bathroom, but was too afraid to leave the room so instead pissed into a pad and threw it out when they left. It might not be the worst, but even then I knew how low I had fallen. I felt sub-human not even being able to reach a bathroom. 

But I think I've changed quite a lot in the past 2 years. I'm not sure what caused such a drastic change in such a short time, but in comparison, I can definitely see it. 

I can now go to stores on my own. :)

I can now go to a public gym. :) 

I can now eat in public. :)

I can now leave my home alone. :)

I can now talk to some people and keep eye contact. :)

I say thank you to cars that stop for me. :)

I've called friends. :)

I've talked to strangers. :)

I've made new friends. :)

I've talked when in group work at school. :)

I say ""Thank you"" to my bus driver. :)

I walk 30 minutes to class everyday through the city. :)


I still hesitate when I leave my house or head to the gym. I still find it hard to keep a conversation going and to keep eye contact. I still find it hard to smile at strangers, but I think I've come a long way. :) 
Anxiety never goes away, but I think I've begun to manage it. ",7,2012-04-13 08:50:07 EDT-0400
256,"Seriously, don't knock it 'till you try it","Hello my name is Zombiekitty and I had severe anxiety whenever I tried to study. I'm currently in grad school and about half way through my program. Last semester I failed 2 classes. Rather than outright failing me, the professors were nice enough to give me an ""incomplete""and let me re-take the exams. 


I had quit my job in November to be ready for my exams in December and but I ended up failing 2 classes anyways. I felt like shit. I retook the the exam from Mrs. E in early March and I failed again, even after studying a shit ton for it. Dr. T told me to see him at the beginning of the Spring semester. The semester is over in 3 weeks and I still haven't seen him. I so horribly afraid of failing a 2nd time and having my financial aid taken away.


During my first round of studies I felt the normal anxiety that comes with prepping for exams. After the failures, I started being afraid of failing, so anxiety starting building up whenever I sat in front of my books. My symptoms went from being uncomfortable to having full blown sobbing sessions with my body trembling something awful. 

I'd sit in front of my text book and begin reading. My heart would begin to race. I felt light headed. My hands would begin to tremble, then came the shortness of breath. And finally, tears would fall on the pages before me.

What used to be my joy, the thing that also kept my curiosity going, now had me retreating to the opposite end of the room. I've had anxiety before this was by far the worst because its affects were destroying my grades. I recently came off financial aid probation and here I was back at square one. What if they take away my only source
 to pay for school, not to mention living expenses? 



It seemed that my only choice was to use medication to treat my symptoms. But I wasn't looking forward to that option. I was on anti-depressants for a short while a few years ago but I stopped taking them because I just didn't ""feel right"", you know what I mean?

And then I remembered Chinese medicine. If needles and herbs had 
helped my physical aches and pains, why wouldn't  it be able to treat this?

My first treatment gave me some relief. I felt relaxed and able to get to my regular duties.

It was the second treatment that really made a difference. After he inserted the needles and left the room, weird stuff started happening. I got really, really cold even thought I had two heat lamps on me. My body got waves of goosebumps, then I started sobbing like a child. The acupuncture points were helping me have an emotional release I was 
unable to have on my own. After the tears dried up, I felt calm. 
After laying there for 30minutes, he returned to remove the needles and I told him of my experience. He said it was a good sign and decided to give me some ""homework"".  I was given some herbs to make a tea that I was to drink and hour before bed time. He also told me to massage my kidneys for a few minutes and massage the point [Kidney 1](http://yinyanghouse.com/acupuncturepoints/kd1) right before bed.


The tea and massage are to help me wind down enough to fall and stay asleep (yes, I suffered from insomnia and waking up frequently during the night). The tea didn't taste was bad as I thought it would. It was sweet with a hint of bitterness at the end. The massaging wasn't so bad either, though I will admit that I cried the first two nights I massaged Kid 1. I wasn't crying because it was painful, I was having emotional releases.


The next day, I had a two hour study session that just flew by. I took a 30 minute break and then went back into it for another hour and 45minutes. Not a single tear was shed! I felt fantastic. My fear was nearly gone. It was more of an annoying sound in the back of my mind instead of the blaring monster that was freaking me out.


I had my reservations about using acupuncture for emotional issues because of studies saying it's a sham or the placebo affect.
I am my own proof that it helps. I went to the 3rd treatment earlier this week and discussed my progress. I was sleeping better, I actually had energy throughout the day, and most importantly, I was getting work done.

I have another 3 sessions left to help finish clear up stuff. I was advised to go in for occasional ""tune up"" if symptoms returned.


Chinese medicine isn't a cure all, but then again, nothing really is. I preferred having my qi moved around by needles and herbs instead of pills altering my bio-chemistry. I understand and am fully aware that medication is  necessary for some people (I prefer you to be alive & medicated than be all dead). If my symptoms weren't improved or if they worsened I definitively would have taken medication.

I wanted to share my story since I know a lot of us are apprehensive about taking medication.


TL;DR Acupuncture is currently helping my anxiety. Yes, I know some of you of skeptical. But this is my story, not yours.",47,2012-04-14 00:02:53 EDT-0400
257,"Having an attack and crying for the first time in years as a 24 year old male. I just really need to talk to somebody, please.","I'm having insomnia tonight and my anxiety was just getting worse and worse and I felt it coming and I just started crying and I haven't really cried in years. 

I worry about everything.

I get anxiety because I just moved away from my home-city to a city that's a 2 hour ferry ride away and an hour drive. All of my family except my oldest sister is still in the home city. I'm lonely over here.

I worry about my mom because I know she has anxiety like I do and it's getting worse with age. She also has a heart-related condition that is giving her a lot of pain and may lead to a heart attack or stroke. She is so important to me and I don't think I could lose her.

I worry about my dad, who's an emotional lockbox and is retiring soon. He and my mom both drink heavily and they've never stopped despite many attempted interventions by myself and (half-heatedly) from my sisters. My mom has a ton of anxiety about getting old and really wants to go on vacations and have some new experiences but my dad doesn't want to do anything except sit at home. They love each other but I feel like he's being incredibly, unbelievably selfish and isn't doing his duty to give my mom the happiness she deserves.

I worry about my older sister. She has some issues that cause her to strain relationships within the family. We had a shouting match tonight but talked it out for an hour and resolved it, but I'm still upset about it. I shouldn't have allowed it to happen even though I wasn't the instigator.

I get anxiety about my other sister, who I am extremely close with (whenever we're together) but ever since I moved it seems like we're losing contact. Sometimes we go a few days without even texting each other, and that scares me.

I feel so responsible for keeping the ties on this family close, and I feel like I'm not doing a good enough job and no one else is trying or sees it. I guess my picture of the perfect family unit has been shattered in years past and I'm trying so desperately to retain it.

I have anxiety about the fact that I'm 24 years old and I've never had a serious relationship. Before my last pseudo on-and-off girlfriend of 4 months I had never had sex with the same girl more than twice. I can talk to woman fine and I know I'm decently attractive but I've never dated the same girl for more than 4 months. It never really bothered me that much in my early twenties but now that I'm almost 25 it scares me. There's nothing in my life more important to me than family, and there's nothing more important to my future than a wife and kids who I can love, and now I'm worried that I won't ever get that.

I worry that I'm falling so unbelievably short of my potential and that I'm ruining my life. I graduated with distinction from one of the hardest degree programs in Canada (with very little effort, wasn't able to apply myself either) and got a great job in November, but I can't apply myself to it or get motivated (Reddit on my phone 6 hours a day). I ""hate"" my job even though I know it's a great opportunity and I should be excited for it, and I know that I would hate any job right now. I am so scared that I'm just a lazy person and I'll underachieve my entire life. (Please don't think any of that is bragging, I just want to provide context for how I'm feeling. I'm not a boastful person.)

I have anxiety about my past, particularly middle/high school. I was picked on and bullied and I just wish I could go back and change so many things. I wish I could've stood up for myself and punched the bullies in the face and fought for one time over that whole period.

I'm so afraid of getting old. I'll be 25 in June and I feel like my twenties are blowing past me and I'm wasting them.

I get anxiety over my friends. My best friend and former roommate did something that broke my trust nearly a year ago. We were incredibly close and ever since then, it just hasn't been the same. He doesn't know that I know what he did, but I can't look at him the same way. He's probably still my best friend, but the absolute trust just isn't there anymore. Two of my other good friend (and practically only friends) in new city are moving away for the summer, one for Basic Training and the other to work on a cruise ship. I'm lonely.

I get anxiety in my life because I've struggled with erectile dysfunction due to anxiety. With new partners it happens moderately frequently, and I'm incredibly ashamed of it and terrified that it will happen with any new girl, which obviously just makes it worse and a self-fulfilling prophecy. I've never been able to truly enjoy sex because of this, I'm always concious of it.

I get anxiety about my anxiety. I know there's something wrong with me and I need to fix it but I haven't done anything yet.

I get anxiety about dying prematurely, not for myself but because I know it would absolutely destroy my family and my mother especially.

I get anxiety about the fact that all of my resolutions to improve come when I'm getting anxiety and yet I follow through on so few of them.

I'm sorry this is so long. I just had to get this out, to somebody, anybody, even if nobody reads this it's out there. I'm not sure how to end a post like this.

260,Passionflower: the most helpful herb(?),"Long-time anxiety sufferer here, probably my whole life on-and-off.  The last 8 years it's been on and it's sucked.  I've gone through a ton of prescriptions (pretty much every SSRI), buspirone, a few types of benzos (which help, but obviously shouldn't be used daily), beta-blockers, and tried a number of natural herbs, etc. with very little benefit.  That is, until I tried passionflower.

It actually works -- for me, at least.  I've found it more helpful to me than pretty much every other pill (maybe other than alprazolam/xanax) in terms of effectiveness and seems to have a total lack of side-effects.  It's not a 100% effective, but then again neither are benzos, but it is by far the most helpful treatment I've found and really doesn't cost much.  I've found 1 pill gets me through until about lunch (standard dose calls for 2 pills however many times daily you need), and then I usually end up taking one at lunch, then another a little later in the afternoon and it gets me through the remainder of the day, but I'm sure we're all different.  I've found it usually takes an hour or more for me to really start feeling the effects, then can last potently at least a few hours before it starts to dip, but unlike benzos or any number of other drugs, it's doesn't smack you with a ton of anxiety or drop you off a cliff when it starts wearing out -- it's very subtle, like it's still in effect all day, just that the effects are slowly diminishing.  Another thing that really surprised me was that it's effective off the first pill -- no need to build it up in your system over weeks or anything -- it literally worked off the first pill I took and could hardly believe it.

I buy from Oregon's Wild Harvest and get the organic passionflower, but I'm sure there are other good sources too.  And no, I don't work for them or any other industry even remotely related to medicine/drugs/whatever, I just haven't tried any other place -- haven't needed to cuz the stuff works (for me).

I do occasionally supplement it with l-theanine  (200mg) and/or propranolol (10mg), but I've found passionflower to be pretty damn effective on its own.

I've found zero tolerance with the stuff, nor have I felt any dependence whatsoever after several months of daily use, and perhaps even better is a lack of side-effects -- only one might be just a very slight drowsiness.

Anyways, just thought I'd pass news of this badass herb along and maybe it'll help other anxiety sufferers.  It's certainly helped me :D",15,2012-04-13 18:31:42 EDT-0400

In that half-awake state, my mind will interpret the noise as something sinister, like a disembodied voice or creepy music, and I'll get so terrified I can't move. Last night, I woke up with an area of localized pain in my leg. I turned on the light to see if there was a bruise, and since there was none, I reasoned that I must have a blood clot. And if I moved too much, the clot would certainly dislodge and destroy my lungs (yes, I'm a nursing student). So until I went back to sleep, I laid there truly convinced that if I didn't lay still, I would die. I didn't remember this episode until the next afternoon.

272,"Frightening thoughts, is this normal???","I have known that I suffer from anxiety.  But now I am having these frightening thoughts about everyone I love dying and how I don't give anyone enough time to spend time with them or take in everything they are, like I take everything and everyone for granted and I don't know how to stop.  I feel like I have lost my drive, that I am too scared of everything to continue, even the thought of going on vacation send my brain spiraling out of control.  I'm scared something is going to happen when I am not here.  I suffer from a digestive-system illness and I am constantly afraid of not feeling good somewhere outside my home.  I feel like there is so much I can't control.  I don't think I am cut out to be a wife and mother one day.  I don't know how to tell someone how I feel without sounding crazy.  Every time I feel this way I push the thoughts out of my head but they keep coming back.  I am scaring myself with these thoughts and think I should be telling someone about them but I am afraid to find out what it all means.  ",6,2012-04-11 07:10:15 EDT-0400

A new symptom appeared since and that is a low rumbling sound and numbness in my left ear and reduced hearing. I started freaking more again as i dont know what this was. I still have it though, almost constantly, it seemed to go away yesterday at our easter get together with my in-laws, i dont remember having it.

Has anyone had something new show up when having an attack?
I know that everyone experiences different things so what are yours?

280,"Today, despite me be terrified, I complimented someone on their dress today and I felt proud.","I have had anxiety since I have been 12 years old. I am going on 21 in July and it is mostly of people. I am on medication, Effexor 37.5mg and have been since September 2011. Yes, I hadn't been on medication for very long despite me having anxiety for as long as I have. I hated the fact of being on it, but it has helped me despite me hating it.

Today, I went for a work out and after I was done and in the change room, there was a girl with this dress that I really liked and after getting everything from my locker, I finally decided to compliment her after contemplating it for 3 minutes or so. She said thanks with a smile and I have never been so proud of myself. I just said, ""Let's challenge yourself today"" and I did it! I hope that that compliment helped her too because it helped me even though she most likely doesn't know it.

Just thought I would post it to give some people hope that even if you've had anxiety for years, if you challenge yourself enough, you are able to do anything. 

Working out DEFINITELY helps you with your anxiety. Oh man, does it ever. You sweat everything out. You get all of your energy out and you are just completely exhausted and you feel SO good after despite you being completely exhausted. Today was the first time I worked out in a while and man, I feel awesome. I also had a big breakfast too which helped (scrambled eggs, toast and bacon and tea)!",7,2012-03-06 21:09:47 EST-0500

282,Sometimes what you hear on the radio can punch you in the guts.,"I am getting ready for work today and NPR's story board comes on and it's this little kid with cancer. He was diagnosed with it when he was like 16 months old or something and after three operations he's finally cancer free and is now a 12 year old.

I am not a 12 year old, I am a 30 year old who was just diagnosed with GAD and have been working through it with a variety of methods, therapy, medicine, breathing exercises and stuff like that. It seems to be working but i have my days and sometimes it's hard to get up in the morning. Who am I fucking kidding? Getting up in the morning, getting showered, dressed, fed and out of the fucking door to go to my job is one of the hardest points in the day. The safest I feel is about 10 p.m. in bed knowing that I am going to have sleep for the night, mayby.

So this kid on the radio says something, and I paraphrase here, that he never knew how precious/important/great life was until he almost died, and I started crying. Ever since I have been having recent massive panic attacks and got diagnosed and on meds I have not had an epiphany like this. It makes me feel that all the anxiety I have over problems are really in the long run just a bunch of bullshit chemical imbalances and not really legit and that I am kind of being a pussy about it.

Anyone with this knows that anxiety literally makes a mountain out of a molehill, no matter what. I can look at that little hill and I can say in my mind ""yeah, that is a mole hill, that isn't anything that I can't handle, I'm a strong man."" But then my brain says ""No, fuck you, that's mount fucking Everest, you have no oxygen and you know what you're going to die if you try to tackle it. Just try it, go ahead.""

My therapist describes people as having ""scouts"" inside of a person. He said the scouts are there to protect you and they delight in their job. If you're walking across the street and a car comes crashing out of the middle of nowhere your scouts will pull you back, it's your instincts that he's talking about. He said the scouts have done their job, they're sated and they've done a good job.

He said my scouts are always on alert ALWAYS no matter what, so if I get a weird phone call or if I hear a noise at night or a car go by, my scouts are on full alert that the worst possible case is going to happen and I need to hunker down because it's going to be a dangerous and bumpy ride.

I don't know where I am really going with this post. I know that the meds and the therapy have helped me in these weeks, and helped me realize that I have had this problem for a long time, but I just want to say ""fuck you anxiety, seriously, fuck you. I am sick of you and I don't want to have you around fucking up my life anymore. I am a grown man and I should be able to conquer you, I want to conquer you and goddamn it I am going to do anything in my humanly fucking power to do it. Go to hell.""

283,Vitamin D and anxiety,"About 5 months ago I started feeling extremely sick, and starting having extreme anxiety. Every morning I'd wake up anxious and start crying. I could barely handle work, I had panic attacks, once I started crying I couldn't stop, I was miserable. I finally got some anxiety pills from my doctor, which helped, but I still felt really anxious.  I finally got some bloodwork done and it turns out my vit. d was really low, I started taking 10,000 mg a day and even after a week I could feel the difference. I've been on it for a month now and I feel so much better. 

I thought I would post this on here to share because I know how much it sucks to feel that way. So you might look into getting your levels checked, doesn't hurt to check and maybe it will help you as well. ",18,2012-03-03 19:35:40 EST-0500

285,I try not to hate people.,"I'm not a bad person. In fact, many people would argue that I'm the exact opposite. I've been teaching special ed for ten years. I'm kind, generous, and helpful. However, I do possess a fatal flaw, which has been slowly, deteriorating my soul. I can't say, no. I am a people pleasing fool, and it's a constant struggle for me to set limits. 

My job requires such intense intervening, teaching, supervising, and interacting with people, that it causes me to resent others who don't have to work as hard. My classroom is Grand Central Station. I'm so burnt out. I've been running on empty, and I feel like my engine is going to die. My tolerance is diminishing. I don't care when people share with me about their lives. I don't want to talk on the phone to anyone when I get home. I rarely return texts. I pick fights with my patient, boyfriend, (who is the absolute love of my life). But, even he has had enough with my job. I feel that my inability to set boundaries combined with the impossible, endless, demands of my job, is sucking the life out of me. 

The district provides little support and expects a whole hell of a lot of demands. I used to think my students suffered the most, as there's no way one teacher, one person, can meet their individual needs. Of course, me, being the teacher I am, I stretch myself thin everyday, barely meeting the needs of half my caseload. 
Now I think I'm the one suffering, perhaps more than my students. Kids are resilient. Not that they don't deserve the most appropriate, individualized education. They not only deserve it, but, as the law states, are entitled to it. 

I've shared my concerns and even cried to my principal. Everyone advises me to leave on time, ""leave my work at work"". ""You can't be everything to everybody"", is another common response to my issues. However, how the hell do I even begin to provide effective instruction to these kids with special needs when I am not prepared? I don't have time during my paid hours to plan. I hardly have time to do all the required paperwork. I usually leave for work around 7 am and arrive home after 6 every night. I got home a little over an hour ago, and I still have to plan half my day tomorrow. Without any plans, how do you teach effectively? Do you just say, ""Fuck it"" and have kids do worksheets all day long?

So, my dilemma is this: do I leave at a reasonable time everyday, and provide the minimum, knowing that I'm not doing the very best I can? Or, do I continue working as hard as I possibly can, draining my every last drop of energy? As an advocate for kids with special needs, I would be going against everything I stand for if I decide to go with the first option.

 I just don't know what to do. I don't enjoy life anymore. I'm isolating myself. I'm not me anymore. However, when I do have a teachable ""ah ha"" moment with a student, I can't see myself doing anything else. At what point do I say, ""Enough is enough?"" 

Has anyone else reached this point of overload? ",5,2012-03-01 06:56:35 EST-0500

Certain routes, like my drive to work, have become routine, and don't bother me as much. But if I have to deviate from it whatsoever, even to get gas, I am incredibly uncomfortable.

291,Effexor - Xanax - Beta Blockers - Opinions Requested,"Currently, I am on Effexor-XR 150 milligrams (mg) for trait social anxiety. Previously I had tried a few different anxiolytics (e.g., Lexapro) but the side effects outweighed the benefits. At my previous university, I found that the Effexor-XR 150 for trait and Xanax 50 mg for state anxiety resulted in a relatively stable mode of living, but have recently started a graduate program at a different university where the clinicians are more negatively biased toward medication-based solutions.

After starting my new program, the university health services physician  told me that they were uncomfortable prescribing Xanax and told me to try behavioral methods to control my panic attacks. After a few months of performing *terribly* during my academic/research/any social presentations (including, at times, simply talking to other people casually), and employing multiple techniques to reduce my social anxiety, I called uncle and met with her earlier this week to request my Xanax back. During that time, she *strongly* suggested that I consider taking beta-blockers instead, or increasing my Effexor-XR daily dosage (I have never gone above 150 mg).

In a beautiful, perfect world, I would have found a behavioral solution that reduces my social anxiety without medication. Currently, I cannot afford to regularly undermine my credibility as an academic and embarrass my research group by becoming discombobulated nearly every time I present. Thus, my questions for you (patient) souls are;

1) Does anyone have experience/advice in regards to increasing the daily Effexor dosage to assuage general social anxiety both in casual situations and/professional presentations? 

2) What are the benefits of beta blockers in comparison to Xanax from a physician standpoint? From a patient standpoint?

3) At my previous university, with my standard medication, I **
loved** giving presentations (albeit, when at the beginning of having a panic attack, I had a Xanax). It is only after I recently began my graduate program that I become overwhelmingly anxious. Would this be most easily remedied by some of my options [a) attempt calming behaviors and use Xanax as a last resort, b) increase Effexor dosage, c) start using beta blockers]

Sorry for the verbose post and thanks for your patience.

**TL;DR: Should I increase my Effexor-XR dosage, switch from Xanax to beta-blockers, or see if I can get away with a career in academia experienced from the fetal position?**",25,2012-03-03 08:31:59 EST-0500

293,Changing anxiety symptoms..,"My main anxiety symptom for years was becoming conscious of my breathing to a level where if it would happen, I would mess up my breathing and became woozy.. I learnt to live with that.. There would be months when I did not have it.. Then it would come back. I was not sure that it was anxiety at the time.. But now I know it just has to be.. 

Then last april I got a cold pneumonia and with that I hit a new peak of anxiety in which I was ""introduced"" to a whole new slew of symptoms: feeling like I had to pee, burning of the skin, chest, stomach.. Mental waves of fear going through me..

Now. After last springs anxiety break. I have been getting better. First with ssris for six months and last 5 months without.. It has not been easy.. But I am now at a level where I can have days when I sleep pretty normal and have no skin burning sensations.. 

But as of late.. I have noticed that when I sleep well.. Days when  I have no other symptom.. I am hit with mental anxiety attack about mid day.. It has happened 3 times in the last 2 weeks.. So. I sleep well.. Wake up. Drowsy and feeling well rested.. But then I start feeling this 
restlessness in my thoughts. Feeling like I am going crazy.. Like the world is caving in (usual panic attack right?).. And it lasts a few hours and goes away. 

Actually there was one I had last week that I was able to stop really fast by drinking a little bit of coffee.. Which made me think that this could be related to caffeine withdrawal.. 

The weird thing is that every time when I sleep bad these days.. I actually do not get panic attacks.. It is almost like I am too tired for them to start.. Which is a real mind ef because I like to sleep well.. But if sleeping well triggers panic attacks.. I just do not know.. 

So I guess my question would be. Has anyone diagnosed with severe anxiety disorder ever got better.. And as they have.. Did you notice the changing anxiety symptoms.. Did they slowly just get less and less?",10,2012-03-05 02:43:05 EST-0500

295,"Quick question, does anyone have increased anxiety as a result of increased pollen levels, or problems with your sinuses? ","I've noticed over that over the past four or so years my anxiety symptoms wax and wain depending upon the time of year. You see, while I get anxiety and panic attacks if I'm in an unfamiliar place, or surrounded by a lot of people, sometimes I would have week-long periods of anxiety that seemed to come out of nowhere, and disappear in a week or two. It was then that I noticed that these episodes come and go around two to three times a year, all at the same time. 

I would wake up and just feel completely drained. My heart would race all day, I would have racing thoughts, clammy hands, I would have hot flashes, a spaced-out feeling, my ears would be full, and I just felt really really off. The littlest things would send me into a panic. It was by complete chance that I decided to look up the pollen level for my area. It was almost the maximum reading.

Now, I have known all my life that I've been affected by increased pollen. Usually it was a runny nose, stuffiness, cold-like symptoms, etc. My entire dad's side of the family has the same symptoms. They also suffer from the same anxiety problems that seem to come and go randomly during the year. Last week the anxiety started creeping up on me again, and I could feel it. I know what's coming, so I'm usually able to contain it well and just ride it out, even though it's pretty uncomfortable for me. I also have a take-as-needed prescription of Ativan if it gets too bad. I checked online, and sure enough, my entire state is completely red with pollen from three different sources. Right now it's so bad that everyone's car is a about three shades yellower. 

Right now my dad is on the couch, saying he's not feeling well. He finally told me that he's been having really bad anxiety symptoms (racing heart, stress, worrying), and he's afraid there's something wrong with him. He told me that it comes and goes during the random times of the year for around two or three weeks. Then I mentioned the pollen thing, and he told me that the last time he went and saw a doctor for these symptoms (a few years back) that they told him it could be a correlation with your sinuses. Pollen inflames our sinuses like no tomorrow, and we get pretty annoying headaches, aggravation, and stuffiness from them.

**tl;dr** Does anyone suffer anxiety when there's an increase in pollen levels? Could this be a cause for why I get random episodes of higher-than-normal anxiety levels for around two weeks during the same times of year?",8,2012-03-03 05:07:14 EST-0500
296,New to /r/ anxiety,"I never used to have anxiety. I used to always be happy, go-lucky, and fun.

I'd have to say that my anxiety and depression reared it's ugly head in middle school. I grew up in a home with an insecure mother and a mean drunk as a step father. The abuse was terrible, especially from my step father. Emotionally. Physically. Sexually. 

My mother, at the beginning of high school, divorced him. But got back with him after a year, blaming me for not supporting her enough during her tough time. I told her I couldn't stay with him around, so I gave her a choice. Him or me. She chose him.

At 18, I moved out and in with a friend. It's been 4 months. Friend hates me now. She's tired of my face. Won't even look at me. Her mom is the only one really supporting me staying there. I'm Not welcome back to my moms. She wants nothing to do with me.

Ever since then my anxiety has been getting worse. Ive started giving up. I'm not going to pass senior year of high school. My weight has soared. My attacks are happening more frequently than they ever have. I can never calm down enough to enjoy myself, and I'm in constant panic. 

This is a throwaway. I know too many people on reddit. I came to /r/anxiety because I need help and support to get through this. I just want some reassurance that I'm not alone.

297,This is what I'm anxious about; am I really all that crazy?,"I'm anxious about almost everything, but some things make me much more anxious than most. One of those things is the general future of humanity. I've heard countless times that one must ""look out for oneself,"" and though I agree with it to some degree, I feel like this statement is just.. so *selfish*. All my life I've been pretty altruistic. I'm willing to go out of my way to help others because that's what makes me happy. But lately, I feel like my actions go unnoticed or are simply pointless. (I'm talking about people who are my friends, not only random strangers).
My mindset is shifting toward the belief that most people nowadays have lost sight of what's really important, and only display disgusting, rude, or impulsive behavior and fulfilling one's own immediate needs without regards to others' feelings or the future. I feel as though most systems of power are corrupt and greedy and that the people who *should* be leaders are being trampled by those who value materialism.
I see this everywhere: the government, ""reality"" TV, the fellow students in my university, the people who *run* my university, any large company, teenagers, doctors, EVERYONE. All anyone cares about is money and screwing others over to get more. Nobody wants to help those in need, and the people that do go unnoticed or are ignored. Everyone's lazy. I feel like I should be living in a past era.. But am I just being delusional? Has the world always been like this? If so, why would I want to live in a world like that?..

**TL;DR My mindset is shifting toward the belief that most people nowadays have lost sight of what's really important, and that most people are impulsive, greedy, and corrupt. Am I delusional or do I have a legitimate basis for feeling anxious?**

Korea or something) or that a nuclear apocalypse will occur and there will be no hope. Does anyone else ever think this or am I slowly driving myself insane for no reason?

ANOTHER EDIT!: I just thought of another thing. The link between the overuse/misuse of antibiotics and diseases that have evolved to become antibiotic-resistant. Thanks to assholes who don't listen to their doctors and take their meds correctly & the use of antibiotics in animal farming, one day there's gonna be some ridiculous super-illness like the Black Plague that wipes out a good portion of humanity.

310,Just me venting anonymously to the equally anonymous masses,"I am starting to lose control, and I just need to vent.


I am so sick of my lack of peer companionship. I had decided that this fall would be different. I pushed through my anxiety and started inviting people to hang out. I only have a handful of casual-but-friendly acquaintances and friends-of-friends in this area, but friendships have to start somewhere, right?


Despite my anxiety, shyness, and substantial hatred of rejection (seriously... I stopped dating 9 years ago and haven't made a new friend since my junior year of college), I managed to send out a facebook message inviting people to come see a movie with me. I got several polite turn-downs (working late, already have plans, promised to visit grandma, etc) and a few no replies. Many of the polite turn-downs included a ""thanks for thinking of me, and let me know the next time you do something like this.""  Not bad at all, right?

The next week, I tried again with dinner. Same result, only with more ignores and only one ""ask me again next time!""s.  I gave it a few weeks and tried it again with coffee. Ditto. Failure.

A few weeks after *that*, I picked an activity that I thought would appeal to four of the people who'd responded before, and I only invited the four of them to join me. I got four polite no's.


I have received 0 invitations back. Nobody is into hanging out with me.


I can't do this again. I am totally deflated. I have no idea why I even bothered to TRY to make friends. Everyone left me before, and these new people would also eventually leave me, and this whole thing is a waste of time and a guaranteed way to feel left out and alone. People get married and move far away. People have kids and want to raise them somewhere with more museums or closer to their in-laws. I am here, alone, and I was doing a wonderful job of accepting that. 


I just really hate myself right now. I was okay, I was stable, I was happy, and then I had to go and mess everything up. Now instead of feeling comfortable with my solitary life, I feel rejected and inferior and alone. 


I don't drink often, but I think I need a glass of wine tonight.


Thanks for listening, reddit.

*An Update, 2 Years Later: Nothing is better. Most things are worse. I found out that I'm not eligible to adopt or foster a child due to the amount of time I spend caring for my sick parents and running their business. I've started drinking at night (alone in my house) to help myself sleep, but then I always wake up in the morning. After over a decade without any male attention or male contact, I lost my virginity to an old friend I hadn't seen in a very long time, and then he promptly stopped talking to me and dropped out of my life... and that's the greatest victory I've had in recent memory, because at least I held a decent man's attention for 8 days and was attractive enough that he was okay with making me his one-night stand. My Facebook feed used to be full of engagement rings and wedding pics; now it's all first-day-of-school pics and big brother/big sister announcements. My once-stable family is now a mess, with degenerative health problems and emotional disorders that I can neither fix nor escape. I wish I could die, but that's not an option because somebody has to take care of them and there is nobody else to do it. I've started contacting cemeteries for funeral pre-planning information to cheer myself up with the reassurance that I will get to die someday and then nothing will hurt and nothing will matter and all of the weight will be off of me and it will be so wonderful. There will be a way out of this someday, and it will be so peaceful. I just wish I could wake up in the morning and be 80 years old and then slip back to sleep and stay at peace forever. I've lost faith and hope. I no longer feel that any higher power has a personalized plan for my life or that he/she/it is aware of or concerned with any of my day-to-day experiences. Every Christmas carol feels like it's mocking me. I used to believe those words so sincerely, and in hope and a plan for everyone. I'm alone. I've been alone for years now. I was alone when I originally wrote this, and I've only gotten more alone. Someday I will die alone, and I will leave no one behind to grieve me. I guess I just write this as a warning to all that time doesn't make everything better. The universe tends toward disorder, and things fall apart. Not everyone gets to be an astronaut when they grow up. If you have hope, hold on to it. Once your bit of hope is gone, you might not encounter any more that you can grab ahold of. Try to hold on to hope for as long as you can, even if you have to lie to yourself.*",10,2012-10-11 04:21:33 EDT-0400

321,[Help] My best friend has become nearly incapable of living his every day life because of his anxiety.,"This is going to be a wall of text. You've been warned.

My friend, let's call him Stephen, was diagnosed with general anxiety disorder and major depressive disorder last year, when we were sophomores in high school. It was because of my same diagnosis that summer that he got the courage to go. He's now sixteen. He was slowly learning to cope with the anxiety and depression, but like most, he had some off days. He always managed to get on with his day though.

Fast forward to this summer. Stephen's father died suddenly of a heart attack. His mother hadn't been living with them for years and he'd built up a lot of resentment towards her. She moved back in to take care of Stephen and his little sister. Stephen's mother stopped drinking and whatever else it was she was doing to take care of her children. She also has some mental health issues, but takes medication. The anger Stephen felt towards her lessened. Stephen also got his first serious girlfriend.

Everything was going okay for a while until about a month and a half into school. I think everything just hit him like a ton of bricks. He started having panic attacks on a daily basis, and wouldn't come to school because of them, especially on days when he had a particularly difficult class. His anxiety causes him to feel physical pain in his chest and sometime completely shuts his body down to the point where he can't walk. His therapist also wanted to put him in the psychiatric ward at the hospital. Stephen refused to go and his mother refused to let him, as she knows what that area is like.

Stephen used to tell me that he would never actually kill himself. Especially not now, when he wants to go to heaven to see his father again. Saturday night though, he called me, crying. His mother has relapsed and stopped taking her medication (I don't know how long or if she's started again since then). He said he couldn't even get her to pay the phone bill. He told me he wished he was dead. I sat on the phone with him and talked him down until he told me he was going to be okay for the night. We texted later that night and the next day. So far, he's said nothing else that dark. He's worried about school and his family and his girlfriend. I'm scared to death of what will happen if his girlfriend decides to break up with him.

I know what panic attacks are like and I know how it is to be worried every second of every day. However, I don't know what it's like to have my parent die, then have to live with some lady who caused a lot of my pent up rage. He's barely coming to school now. I need to know how to help him. No matter what I say, it doesn't seem to help when the morning comes and he has to get ready for school. I know he's in a lot of pain, but I don't want him to give up. I think some of our other friends might be giving up on him, but I refuse. 

Sorry this is so long, but I wanted to explain the situation. Any advice would be greatly appreciated.",2,2012-10-09 21:16:04 EDT-0400

I wake up, remember that I have to go to school, then I'm overcome by a sense of dread, so I just roll over and go back to sleep. When I wake up later I feel so guilty for not going.

I don't have any particular fear about school. When I do go, the day goes by without any problems. I have no problem sitting in class, hanging out with my friends at lunch, etc. I just can't get myself there.

My psychiatrist knows about the problem, but he just told me I need to get more sleep. But I kow that's not the problem; sometimes when I do get out of bed and get to school, I don't enter the building and just go sit in the park instead.

Those two words just run through my head constantly. Every time I would think about taking a risk or breaking a rule I'd get way to overwhelmed to go through with anything. When I did, I always had a strong sense of guilt. I feel like most of the time, my anxiety holds me back from living my life to the fullest. In a way it seems like I'm missing opportunities and I'm stuck in the corner in a fetal position. I wish my friends understood anxiety sometimes. I know it really annoys and bothers them a lot, but I can't help it! I always feel awful when I have a complete panic attack and they have to see a side of me I would never want them to witness. I can't stop it when it happens, and it just bugs me to no end. I wish I didn't have anxiety, or feel the need to question every single thing I do, or overanalyze it.

334,65-yr old needs soothing and advice about treatment,"I am 65yr-old and recently I was diagnosed with atrial fibrillation and one month ago I had a transient ischemic attack *(TIA - a minor stroke). 

Since then, I've been told by my doctor to take Xarelto 20mg (an oral anticoagulant), aspirin, a beta-blocker (Pindolol) and an antidepressant (Lexapro or Escitalopram) . I have no known risk factors (idiopathic? early ageing?), I'm physically very active for my age, but I have suffered a lot due to anxiety and depression, mostly after I lost my wife (6-yrs ago) and started unhappy liasions with young women since then. 

What worries me most is the feeling of being alone and undersupported by my fellow doctors (I am a pathologist and teacher in this branch of medicine). I need to sleep well since this is the only way to calm down my heart. 

About the sleeping matter there has not been agreement between the neurologist and the cardiologist that are taking care of my case. The first one advised me to replace Alprazolam (better known as Xanax) by Zolpidem (Ambien) in order to avoid addiction. The other one advised me to take Alprazolam (better known as Xanax), since according to him I have a profile for that.

What troubles me most are my almost constant chest discomfort and breathlessness, which increase in the afternoon. Sometimes I have a feeling of helplessness because my doctors don't call me back, since I need to be advised more frequently, and this situation is leading me almost to take entire charge of my own care, even if it risks me of self-inflicted side-effects, addiction or overdose accident, even death. I need to be relieved of my physical pain, anxiety and anguish.

I woud like to have the advice of the reddit colleagues, specialists or not, about ways to help me. I need urgently to have something to relieve my breath distress and inner chest pain, mostly during the afternoon. Is it possible to associate Clonazepam (Klonopin) during the day, with Zolpidem (Ambien) at night?

My condition is very stigmitizing and sometimes I have the feeling of being deprived of support, even by my psychoanalist. My cardiologist told me that I would be benefitted by an AF ablation procedure, so I decided to go to São Paulo (I live in Brazil) at the end of this month in order to be examined by a great specialist in heart arrythmias.",18,2012-05-13 19:45:16 EDT-0400
335,Wife is having a breakdown. I want to help. ,"My wife and I got married about a year ago. We are very happy with each other and there seems to be no problems between us. We share everything and never keep secrets. 
When we were still dating years ago, she started a week long panic attack that didn't seem to go away. (feeling of encroaching death, diarrhea, loss of appetite, helplessness, anxiety focused towards the next attack, sobbing, complete and utter fear). She got on medication (something related to Lexapro), started exercising, etc. and eventually the symptoms subsided for the most part. She has been generally better and has not had a serious panic attack since. 
Recently though, she has been wanting to get off of the medication due to birth defect warnings (we may want a kid soon) and her general attitude which makes her want to be able to handle this on her own. She talked with her doctor and they decided to try to step her down off of it. Didn't work so well. She basically tumbled into the same week long panic attack that she had experienced in the beginning of this. She has been waking up with panic attacks in the very early morning and can barely make it to work (her work doesn't seem to take the illness seriously and thinks she is just flaking out which adds to her stress level even more). 
Now she typically gets panic symptoms when she is about to go to work, at work, thinking about work, and then the non-consistent panic attacks that we can barely attribute to anything very significant. She has increased her dose in steps back up to the original amount she was taking previously and seeeeems to be doing better. I say seems because  it still seems like she is fighting demons off in her head and she may just be able to cope with it better, or a combination of both. 

She also has picked up a new source of anxiety based on the fact that she may never be able to get off of her medication without losing control of her life. 

Are people with this chronic anxiety ever able to get off of medication? Does anyone have any advice for coping while reducing dosage? Has anyone completely stopped taking meds for their anxiety and feel good about it? I am taking meds for my own case of anxiety and depression which is no where near the intensity she feels. My opinion is that I wish I had never started taking it as i would't have to deal with the 'lightnings' I feel when I am without the meds and other reasons. I don't think other more severe cases can do that as easily. 

tl;dr wife tried to get off anxiety meds, relapsed badly 

On a side note, I read this subreddit a lot and it really helps me gain perspective for both my anxiety and my wife's. Thank you everyone here for posting, you make us feel less alone.

DAE have any weird little quirks like this?,"When things start to pop up or get really stressful for me, I have a tendency to trace out words with my index finger on one of my hands, over and over.  I trace it out on my thumb, my leg or whatever is handy and it seems to keep me somewhat grounded while I wade through my situation.  For example:

Today I found out some very bad news about my credit situation while I was on the bus (I've got some outstanding debt that is making getting into new credit situations, or maintaining current ones very difficult for me).   When I got off of the phone with the lovely folks at Visa I began to think about how I was going to budget the next few months to try and remedy at least part of the situation that I'm in, and I could feel that overwhelming feeling of anxiety creeping up on me.  Immediately, and without thought, I caught the word ""Edmonton"" on a bus ad out of the corner of my eye and my right index finger began to race the letters of the word over and over again onto my thumb while I budgeted in my head.  Because of this minor, subconscious distraction I was able to budget reasonably without getting too distracted by negative, racing thoughts.

I've been doing this since I was at least 7.  Possibly earlier.  Does anyone else have any really tiny things that they do subconsciously that seems to help them through a minor panic attack?  I think it's neat how the body comes up with its own ways of coping that don't require that you stop and think about it first.",25,2012-05-08 05:20:59 EDT-0400

Judging the way he acts (crying, frustrated, thoughts are cryptic and jumpy, feels crazy etc), I think I have been through similar stress caused by school, relationships etc. His stress could be caused by a number of things such as school, lack of role models, etc but these things haven't really been explored yet.

My family can tell he's been acting strange, but they also know he smokes weed. Because I have been through the same bouts, and I have never used weed, it makes me think the weed has little to do with it, besides being another thing to worry about.

346,Health Anxiety (Hypochondria) and I really need some help,"It started about one and a half month ago with a random heart palpitations, and I for reason unknown got the idea in my head that something was wrong with me. 

I'm just 19 year old, but somehow I thought I was having a stroke or something. I'll try to make this long story short.

Since that day, I've thought I have pretty much all cancers that exist (One at a time of course). I've only been thinking about cancerous diseases and nothing else. The symptoms I've felt have ranged from frequent urination and taking dumps more often. I've had very light, and floating feces, I've had palpitations, sweating, short of breath-feelings, recurring pain in my testicle (which I have a lump on), Pain in the prostate-area, chest pain and stomach pains. I've had a lack of appetite.

I've been trough all those, having had CT scans, blood work, urine test, prostate exam, and other tests.

Some days I'm just as normal, and then I'm back surfing the internet for diagnosis for something I've felt in my body. And the most recent is  the one I'm most scared about. I've had headaches, but a very unusual kind, I feel tightness in my head, and the pains are short and in very located specific spots in the head. I've felt unusual, as a human being, I feel like I can't think straight, I've felt dizzy and very tired. I have also noticed that my pupils are not exactly in the middle of my Iris (Perhaps they've always been like that). I can not enjoy anything right now, and I'm afraid that I have a brain tumor. 

It's hard to explain the feeling, but I feel unreal, and unconnected to everything that happens around me, I feel that I have no feelings except anxiety and fright. I don't feel fully awake and functionable. I'm afraid there's something wrong this time.

I've already contacted the health centre and done cognitive tests and they were all flawless, but somehow I'm still a bit concerned, and this is slowly destroying my life, my relationship.

What the hell can I do, should I try to get a scan for my head, is my recent feelings something I should  worry about? I can't go on like this..

I suffer from GAD, Depressive disorder with a dask of agoraphobia and possible mild OCD. The entirety of this trip is making me want to hang myself. I know I will go and have a good time but in between I am climbing the walls.

I had a panic attack a day during the last family vacation. Not counting the issue with being in public with strangers staring at me.

Anyone have advice to help me get through this?",7,2012-05-08 20:53:29 EDT-0400

I normally don't have any justifiable grounds for feeling this way.

Hoping it's anxiety/stress and not something that's physically wrong with my brain. Just want to know if anyone else has experienced this.

352,I never have anything to say.,"Maybe it's due to social anxiety or something else, but in new social situations I can't think of anything to say and feel really stupid as a result. Does anyone else experience this?

I'm a great listener, but when it comes to keeping a conversation going, or moreso starting one, I always struggle to come up with something to say. I am shy, yes, but I do genuinely like hanging out with people and generally don't like to be a loner (& stay at home all the time wishing I had plans). I find it incredibly hard to make friends when I come off as aloof or disinterested, when I'm actually just unsure of what to say next.

I'm so envious of people that can shoot off funny one-liners and tell good stories. I feel like I have no good stories!

This ultimately convinces me that I'm just a boring person with nothing to offer the world and no passions. I let my shyness and uncertainty get in the way to trying new things and exploring possible passions. 

I guess I'm looking to connect with other folks who may feel this way or similarly. I have always wanted to be outgoing and have felt happiest in my life in the rare times I've been comfortable enough to be and had a lot to say. The other 99% of the time I'm shy, quiet, and feel like I thus make others uncomfortable and not want to be around me. It's like I'm an extrovert (who needs the energy of social interaction) inside the thick shell of an introvert.

tl;dr- I feel like an extrovert trapped in the shell of an introvert and wish I had more things to say(one-liners, stories, small talk) to break the ice and thus my introvert shell. DAE feel this way?

355,Massive Anxiety just for LOOKING at job postings!,"Hello

I will be honest. I have graduated from a ""good school"" about close to 4 years ago, but my depression kicked full gear in school and I graduated with a 2.9 with a ""artsy"" major.

It was 2008 when I graduated, and I realize that when I graduated, that I was graduating in the middle of the worst economic recession since the 1920's.

So I bailed on my future. My anxiety rose up, and I spend a year doing nothing but job applying. My first job interview, I fucked up. I was criticized for my clothes not being professional enough. At least they told me. The other rejections came, but they never told me why. I started to get hung up on my looks (I look 17 on my best days, 16 on most days since I am short with a baby face) After all of those fiascos, I applied for temp jobs, working on and off (mostly off) for about 3 years now.

I want a stable income and a stable good enough job. But here's the kicker: This anxiety shoots up inside of me whenever I look at job postings.

This is how the process is:

1) looks at job postings (the few times in the year that I do, it takes soo much out of me to do this part btw)

The thoughts start to race: *god, I don't like these jobs*, *god, I don't qualify for anything*, *i am obviously going to get rejected*.

Then my heart starts pumping like I am in a marathon.

*fuck*. Then I feel so fucking worthless and helpless.

I want a job, I really do. But I guess not good enough, since I can't fucking get over looking at job postings without being hit with this massive anxiety.

Writing resumes/cover letters is also horrible. I can't think of anything to say. I become a blank page.

Glad to get this off my chest.",12,2012-02-13 04:53:09 EST-0500

357,Anybody have both anxiety and ADHD/ADD?,"I was recently diagnosed with adult ADD (i am a 20 year old college student). I've gone my entire life dealing with it, struggling with my schoolwork, and finally decided to get tested. It's incredibly frustrating because, at the risk of sounding conceited, I know I'm a smart guy. Yet, my grades are not a good indicator of my intelligence. I was able to make my way through high school using my ""common sense"", but the college workload is now overwhelming for me. 

Now, the psychologist who did my ADD testing simply recommended a stimulant medication (adderall, vyvanse, etc.). However, once I told him that I suffered from anxiety and panic attacks he said that stimulants often exacerbate both of those things. So I'm stuck. Ive tried natural supplements for concentration, tutors, everything possible. I feel like the medication is the only thing that could potentially help my attention defecit, but i don't want to have to go through more panic attacks if i have to. Needless to say, they terrify me.

As far as my anxiety goes, it's only been a problem for me for the past six months or so. In the beginning I was plagued with feelings of derealization, as if I was going crazy and losing my sense of what was real. I've since learned some coping skills, and the panic attacks have become less frequent; only about twice a month or so. The general anxiety feeling is still there, but the ""going crazy"" feeling is gone. Now i'm simply anxious about having the panic attacks themselves, it's a sort of vicious cycle of thinking.

To get to the question, can anybody with anxiety here take a stimulant medication without it triggering a panic attack or making your anxiety worse? I have taken a friend's ADD medicine during high school (i know, i know) before my anxiety began, so i know what it feels like. I'm trying so hard to find a solution, any advice would be helpful.

361,"Lonely, Anxious, Depressed...what do I do?","I haven't had a good friend in 7 or so years and I am almost a 21 year old man. I suffer from pretty bad anxiety whenever I talk to people or even leave my home, I'd talk to a psychologist but I don't know if I can do that. Together these are making me pretty damn depressed.

Some days I don't feel so bad, some days I don't feel like a freak. I used to exercise but I injured myself and haven't been able to get out much. Whenever I even consider doing certain things it's like I hit a wall, my anxiety blocks me off and I immediately start to feel shitty about it, which worsens my depression. I don't have any friends I can talk to about this.

Part of the reason I think I got so anxious is that I stopped making friends years ago. I can't really fathom why, but I just hated the idea of making new friends when I got to middle/high school, I clung to my best friend until he started getting involved in drugs/vandal shit and I didn't want to. For some reason my other friends kind of disappeared at this time, stopped calling, stopped talking to me. At the time I thought all the other kids at my new school were stupid, that they weren't as mature as me; why should I open myself up to these kids I might not even like? I dunno, maybe it was some sort of pride thing, at the time I was nervous but I really didn't want to be friends with most of them. I had older siblings that I was close to that kind of shaped my tastes, so I didn't share much with my peers, or so I thought. Years later as the other kids became more relaxed and outgoing in school and freely exercised their personalities in public I found that some of them were actually pretty cool, which only furthered my depression as I realized that I had missed out on becoming friends with them.

Anyway, I pretty much became a loner around 9th grade and that was when the anxiety started pouring in, when I lost any friends to talk to in class, when I didn't have anyone to sit with at lunch. I had placed myself above everyone else and then when I needed friends I was too proud and too nervous to actually make friends. For me to go and sit at a group that seemed alright and talk to them just didn't seem possible, I wasn't going to be some supplicant or impose myself on them. I had already created an impression, a mould, in their minds that I couldn't force myself to break. I found myself living to a script that my perception of the public, my anxiety, had made for me. One of the funniest things is that people did reach out to me, offered me friendship, but I turned them down, almost arrogantly. I wanted to seem happy with my solitude, and I guess that's how it looked; I wasn't the typical outcast, I wasn't physically awkward in any way. Everyone in school, even the outcasts, had a group of friends but me, I was truly alone, and it was a self imposed exile.

As I said, this was when the anxiety really awoke in me, when I would get sick in my stomach as I arrived at school, a feeling that wouldn't go away for an hour or so. I avoided any social event, and anything social forced on me was torture. Any period where other kids would talk to their friends was a period of self loathing and withdrawal for me. Anytime they looked at me, whether it be someone from my grade or below me, I would just imagine the derision in their minds and become bitter. Class was the only time I felt ok, I was still so nervous that my hands were always sweaty, but the structure of it usually precluded social interaction and allowed me to not be so stressed. I never spoke in class and would freeze for a moment when the teacher would call on me, this was agony. Without any kind of social support I felt like I was adrift at sea, slowly drowning.

Eventually the anxiety just started seeping into all the other parts of my life. I've been unable to make even simple decisions, like what sort of drink to get at a store or restaurant. I can't drive, the fear of traffic and getting hit are too much for me. I struggle with classwork, with email, any area that is not a comfortable retreat offers me a barrier that I just can't get the energy to climb over. My anxiety has become like my shadow, like a version of myself that follows me everywhere. He holds me down, he whispers into my ear, and he has only become stronger and more convincing as time goes on. He feeds on my weakness, he grows from my sorrow. He has poisoned my mind and my soul. I don't think I'm suicidal, but at my worst I just don't feel like living. I wouldn't commit suicide, but I want to just lie under my blankets and not get out.

I think I may have some natural inclination towards anxiety, there has been a history of it in my family I think. One of my parents suffers from panic attacks, I have an uncle who used alcohol to cope I believe, he's a recovering alcoholic and I have heard that he needed it to be social. I don't know if this affects anything, but if it helps it was worth mentioning. I have the jitters just sitting here typing, revealing these things to you, an anonymous group that I will never know. I can't imagine what it would be like to reveal any of this to a person face to face, let alone one I know personally. Anyway, what do I do?",14,2012-02-09 08:40:09 EST-0500

Probably pretty often...in fact, I would guess that nearly every anxious incident or panic attack has at least some fear involved that never comes to pass. 

If you answered 'yes' to this question, then your brain literally has been lying to you, maybe for years.  That time your brain convinced you that you were dying of cancer?  Liar.  Or that time you were just sure you were going to fail that test?  Lies. 

How about the time you were anxious for days about a work task you were sure you couldn't finish or would mess up terribly, and then you got it done and everything went okay?  That lying brain again...

Remember the anxiety you had about a confrontation with someone, and your mind created a video-prediction of a brutal fistfight with you losing and being embarrassed in front of the whole school/bar/party?  Didn't come true, did it? 

Your brain is a compulsive liar.  Treat it that way.  The next time you have really anxious thoughts or panic attacks, let your mind say whatever it wants, because you know it can't be trusted and compulsively lies. ",2,2012-02-13 05:53:15 EST-0500

367,Anxiety as an immigrant. :(,"Hello all,

Here's my pathetic story, I have no one to talk to so I thought I would make a new account and spill the details.

I've had anxiety ever since I was around 14, it was mild then. I could still go outside with friends and have fun. Then I moved to Canada, Canada is an amazing country, the people are great, the weather is nice, the houses are big and crime is low. I should be so happy but I can't be.

Every time I walk by someone I think to myself ""That person hates me because I'm an immigrant, I bet they think I own the place as I'm walking by them."" It's terrible, I can't speak to anyone as I know they're thinking ""Oh no, another immigrant, why don't you go back to your own country."" My rational brain is telling me that's bullshit as I know Canadians don't think that way but I can't stop it.

I also hate my accent, I'm Scottish so it's pretty strong and hard for Canadians to understand, I try my hardest to not talk at all, I just wish I was born here, I wish I was normal. I have no friends, I can barely walk out the front door. 

I can't see a therapist or doctor because I think Canadians need help before I do as I'm an immigrant here, I don't want to go to a therapist of doctor complaining of anxiety when there are people that need real help. I've been thinking about suicide a lot, I doubt I would have the courage to actually do it but it's always there, in the back of my mind.

I don't have any prospects, I'm 19, I don't go to college (I wish I could), the job I had let me go at Christmas and I just don't know what to do. I'm so scared.

369,I can't deal with this anymore... ,"I just woke up from a cramp in my left calf and my brain is connecting it with a dream I had a few days about about my daughter dying while dressed up as a ninja. Yeah it was a fucked up dream... So naturally my head says ""You have a DVT"". Yes I'm fat and yes I sit a lot but besides a cramp that's the only symptom I have.

Anyway I just can't deal with this shit anymore... if I get heart burn it's a heart attack, if something feels out of whack it's something else. It's like I am trapped inside my own head with every fucking illness in the book. And the thing is I don't know how I got here.

7 years ago I wasn't like this. 5 years ago my father died from a cardiac arrest and they said I had PTSD. But I'm scared of everything now. When I drive on the highway I count mile markers in case I need to call 911 because of a heart attack. I ask my kids constantly ""do you know where you're at?"" or ""what do you do if something happens to me?"". I won't fly because the plane will crash. I am scared to take care of myself like getting on an elliptical because I'm sure I'll die while I am on it or right after I get off it.

http://www.reddit.com/r/ihaveissues/comments/pm78n/broken_heart_first_time_physical_problems/
But since I know some more now (and have more questions), I'll ask a bit more. This'll probably also be partially just writing things down for myself.

Short story: Whenever I think of or talk with with a girl (who is one of my best friends) who has rejected me, and is now going with one of my other best friends, I start to get really.. Anxious, probably.

Sweating, trouble with breathing, nausea, throwing up, tension on belly, and just being really nervous or something. It comes down that I pretty much completely shut down. I also hardly eat anything anymore.
I see this girl and guy every day at uni (we do the same study, same everything), and I'm alright that she doesn't like me, but my body doesn't agree with it, or there's something deeper.

I went to my GP, and he told me it was stress/anxiety (I told him the whole story), and prescribed me Propranolol.
I took one yesterday, and it seemed to help somewhat, but I still couldn't talk with her over Skype, or just get in the group chat we usually have (~10 people) without getting really sick. He said I should take 1 each day, does anyone know when it starts to work and when it wears off?

I tried going to uni today, but I had to leave after around 15minutes, since the trembling and nausea was too much for me to handle. I didn't even talk to her in that time, just sat with the rest of the group.

I'm kinda afraid that this will never go away, so should I see a therapist or something? Or while just time heal this? I've had this shit since last friday, and it's been constantly shit since. I just want to be able to talk to my friends again, and be able to just follow classes without problems.",5,2012-02-14 12:45:38 EST-0500

382,Anxiety free for 2 years,"One thing I have noticed is that once you're ""cured"" of your anxiety the last thing you want to do is go on message boards/subreddits etc where people who have anxiety are getting together and describing their symptoms/feelings etc. 


The problem with that places like this subreddit have very few people talking about success stories and a lot of people in anguish and suffering.


I wish that I could tell you what I did to cure myself, but it's not that simple. And lapses do happen. When I say 2 years I don't mean 2 years straight. I have had lapses, usually around winter time. But I move on from these lapses and instead of beating myself up and saying ""oh...there goes my streak, I'm back at square one"" I look at it as getting congested or getting a cold for a day or two and then going back to being healthy as opposed to suffering with a terminal illness.

I wrote notes to myself over the course of my recovery and the funny thing the notes all say a bunch of things that sometimes contradict each other. But I want to share with you a few of my resources as well as ""catch phrases"" that I implemented to make myself better.

The first: 

Embrace, and move on. As in, embrace the anxiety and move on. 

The second:

When you're feeling good don't look back and ask ""why, or what happened"" don't try to analyze the anxiety because you're basically telling yourself the anxiety is horrible, I don't want to experience it again, and now I have to find out what I did wrong so I make sure it never happens again. That just makes anxiety your focus. To be anxiety free anxiety cannot be your main focus in life.

Third:

I can handle it. If a thought pops in my head. I can handle it. If I feel a feeling, I can handle it. If I lapse, I can handle it. If I'm afraid of something that might happen in the future, I can handle it if it does. 


Now as far as resources go:

 [Anxietynomore.co.uk](http://www.anxietynomore.co.uk)

 [UCLA's Meditation workshops](http://marc.ucla.edu/body.cfm?id=22)

[The Meditation Society of Australia](http://http://meditation.org.au/index.asp)

[Free Online Cognitive Behavioral Therapy](https://moodgym.anu.edu.au/welcome)

[And the meditation subreddit](http://www.reddit.com/r/Meditation)


Meditation has been my favorite way to deal with my negative feelings, and developing new and more positive feelings. 


Another thing that helps is to try and go 30 days without entertaining a negative thought. Negative thoughts will pop up but you learn to ignore them. This isn't that easy unless you have done the above exercises with meditation and the MoodGym. 


Also some helpful facts to learn about your anxiety. Your anxiety has no mass or volume. It does not build up within you. You can have a cumulative of muscle tension and tightness from constant worrying but you can visualize that build up leaving you and escaping you and being pushed out of you if you like. 

Also turn negative thoughts into cartoony thoughts. Make them ridiculous, transform them in your minds eye into little balls or orbs trying to penetrate your head and imagine yourself having a force field of good will and love preventing the bad thought from taking hold of you. Sometimes transforming a thought into something non threatening and shapeless etc helps a lot to make it dissipate.

I don't think I'll visit this subreddit again or really stick around to answer too many questions. This seems very selfish of me and maybe unhelpful but I know if I stick around here, people will start describing symptoms I may or may not have had, and these symptoms might start appearing in me or I might start experiencing your anxieties as my own etc. and one of the best things I have learned for my peace of mind is to remove myself from places like this.

It's not that places like this can't be helpful, or can't be therapeutic, but for me personally, in order to be anxiety free I must starve my anxiety of any fuel it may want to re-ignite and I really enjoy my life right now too much and love being ""normal"" (whatever that is) too much and have too many responsibilities to the people I love to revisit my old symptoms and other peoples symptoms. 


For me, anxiety is contagious! But I wanted to show you people some love and tell you that I have been there and give you hope. Not false hope but actual hope from someone who has been there done that. 

Do what feels right for you. I created my own cure script and had a progress journal for about 2 years. I went 2 years anxiety, 2 years cured. I'd like to make it 3, 4 etc etc. 


One thing I can say however is that it doesn't matter how long you've had it (as I learned from anxietycure.co.uk) once you start taking positive action you get positive results. But it's hard.


If I where to describe to you what it feels like to be anxiety free, it's like feeling light. Like your muscles have exhaled all the anxiety, your brain feels clean, and shiney, and smooth.  Your chest is open and warm. And your overactive mind is now chewing up philosophy and spirituality, and interests, hobbies, politics, life and no longer chewing over worries, medical websites, symptoms, analyzations, testing yourself, thinking you're nuts, etc.


This is all very jumbled and I don't want to create a TL;DR because I feel like there has to be something in what I've written that has to help somebody out there, but I will tell you that I used to suffer from OCD (sexual), panic disorder, pure O, GAD. Used to take 100mg of Sertralin, now I only take half a 50 pill everyday (because part of me is afraid of going through severe withdrawals so I am weaning myself off VERY slowly)

My anxiety had mostly been about my anxiety. Feeling trapped. What if thinking. Fear of suicide. What if I can't handle it? What if I go crazy? What if I develop schizophrenia etc etc. Obsessions over physical processes like breathing (convincing myself that if I didn't breathe manually I would not breathe at all) touching, seeing, hearing. Fear of becoming depressed and not liking the things I liked and what would I do if that happened. Reading anxiety websites for the magic cure. Obsessively taking notes everytime I felt something and analyzing it to death. Etc. etc. Beating myself up for being so strange. Judging other anxiety sufferers to be weirdos and then telling myself that I am a weirdo too and shouldn't be trusted around people. Fears of my sexuality transforming into something unhealthy or evil.

Phew. That was a lot to get out. But believe it or not, that is all gone. I love you guys. You're not weird. You're brain is programmed to scan for danger and you have taught it that whatever you fear or feel is dangerous, so you are obsessed with it. And you are afraid to stop because you feel that you will be out of control or things will be worse if you don't do your ritual or you don't worry about that impossible thing that will never happen.

It takes a long long time to learn to embrace uncertainty and realize that it's actually better to feel that out of control fearful feeling for a day or two than just do the same thing over and over and over again and feel like crap forever. 


Best of luck to all of you. Don't hate me for not sticking around. I'm like Lot's wife. I can't look back or I'll turn to sand. Gotta keep moving forward. Much love to all of you and support and good wishes.

TL;DR Blah blah blah  Embrace uncertainty

392,[Help] Anxiety about getting older. What do I do?,"Before I write this, I should clarify that I will be turning 22 this coming January.

I've been having this feeling of anxiety about getting older for the latter part of the year and it's beginning to drive me insane. I don't know why I'm having this anxiety even though I'm still quite young. I guess the feeling came about when my younger brother left to go to West Point back in July. For whatever reason, it depressed me quite a bit when he left even though I knew he would be coming home somewhat frequently while he is there. This depression that I was in caused me to think many negative thoughts, with getting older being one of them. I have since gotten over the worst of the depression, however, I feel like it has now been replaced by the anxiety of growing older (and perhaps other forms of anxiety though this one is the most severe). My main fear stems from the fact that my parents will become old and debilitated and will die at some point. Both sets of grandparents are still alive as well but they will most likely be dead in the next decade. I am also scared of other friends and family members becoming older as well as myself. I don't know why, but all I can see are the negatives of getting old even though I know there are positives somewhere in there. I'm having trouble sleeping because of the anxiety and my appetite has also taken a hit. It's also difficult for me to enjoy many of my hobbies because of the anxiety. Christmas isn't helping either as I have visited many of my family members who have noticeably gotten a little older in the past year.

The driving factor behind this anxiety may be from the inevitable nature of aging since I don't have much control over it. What can I do to combat this type of anxiety?

394,"Story about, and advice learned, from my small victory over anxiety tonight","I thought I'd share a quick motivational/success story of sorts-- hopefully it will inspire people or make someone feel better. I'll try to keep this short, which is difficult as I tend to ramble. 

Okay so a little background: 
My friend and I have anxiety-- he's been dealing with it longer than I have, but I've been worse lately. My friend has been on medication for a while and it seems to have helped him. I didn't really have anxiety until a few years ago and it was relatively manageable until recently. I passed out during an internship (part of my graduate program) in part because the stress was too much for me to handle. Before dropping the internship I caved and went on Buspar (my MD was the one who prescribed it though so it was a non-therapeutic dose). Eventually I dropped the internship. I feel less stressed/anxious since then, but I also feel more depressed/hopeless and worry or stress over little things or things far outside of my control. Hopefully my new ""corrected"" dosage works better-- it seems to be helping me cope better, but that could just be because there is less stress in my life now. 

Anyway, my anxiety stems mostly from social situations, stress, and random phobias (e.g. blood, vomiting, etc.). My friend's anxiety is somewhat different, but we both are uncomfortable in ""party"" situations. He does not drink (I believe it is against his religion), while I used to drink, but now don't because of my fear of throwing up. Both of us get anxious in big crowds, however, especially if alcohol or that party-like atmosphere is involved. 



So long story short, our friends had planned this trip into the city tonight. We planned to see the tree and drink at someone's apartment. We split from the group at some point to get dinner with a third friend and ended up having an interesting adventure. We encountered a few situations that were slightly anxiety provoking. For example, we missed our train/subway, which got us lost and forced us to backtrack (through a bad neighborhood at one point), but we were fine the entire time. 

At the end of the night my friend wanted to go home rather than heading back to the apartment where the party was. I knew the party was nothing out of control-- just a few friends drinking casually-- and I wanted to end this cycle of avoiding those situations so I convinced him to stop by so I could use the restroom. We ended up having fun and staying for an hour or so (it was actually his first ""party""). 

I guess the moral of the story is I didn't avoid a situation I typically would have and everything was okay. I had a lot of fun and for the first time in a while felt NORMAL. It was a great feeling.

And I guess I'll end with some advice garnered from my experience tonight: 

1. Take some risks. Don't avoid a situation-- you're only enforcing the reason for the anxiety. Granted this is easier said than done, but it's worth a try sometimes. 
2. No one is alone with this shit and it may help if you are friends with someone else who knows what you're going through firsthand. 
3. I had my medication on me most of the night (it's prescribed twice a day so I took it at the end of dinner) and just having it in my pocket made me feel better because I knew if I felt anxious at any time I had some relief to look forward to 
4. Go out. Do something. Preferably with friends. Don't sit home wallowing. I know it's hard to do when you're anxious, but I felt more alive and happy tonight than I had in a days. 
5. Think positive. Again, not easy to do, but think when the last time thinking negatively worked out in your favor. If you stay positive you have a shot at a silver lining. Did I just quote that new movie? It looks so lame. But the girl is kind of cute. And they're Eagles fans, which is a plus for me. Oh, there I go with the rambling. Oops. But the message is true. If you are positive you will be happier. Studies have shown people who force a smile are more likely to genuinely smile or laugh easier. So smile and think positive.",2,2012-12-22 12:35:08 EST-0500
395,Post things that worked for you!,"I suffer from anxiety as well as OCD. Here are a few things that I learned from my therapist and which I still use:

1: Write down what I fear, and level of fear in percents. Then write down why I should not have this fear. 

Example: ""I am scared of choking on my food""
Fear level: 60%
Rational perspective: I didn't choke on my food earlier today, so why should I choke on it now? Clearly I don't have any physical problems regarding my swallowing mechanisms as fluids like water and soda go down easily. It's actually far easier to handle solid foods than fluids for the swallowing mechanism. Thus I should evidently have no problem swallowing. 


2: Abdominal breathing! Do 15-20 minutes a day. Divide it in several 5-6-7 minute chunks if 15 minutes at once is too much. The mind can't be anxious while breathing with the stomach!",13,2012-12-22 00:35:32 EST-0500

408,"Right now, check your breathing. Is it shallow?","Just found this subreddit and I had to share something I realized today. I've been living with anxiety for as long as I can remember since I was a young child and I'm 22 now. I used to be on medication as a child, but I stopped taking the drugs of my own free will and have been un-medicated for 10+ years. Lately, it's been coupled with depression and I've been having occasional thoughts of suicide. Not even just passing thoughts, but lingering thoughts of not existing anymore and how I would end it and how it would be to die like that. I have very few friends and the friends I do have all know something is wrong with me, but I've never opened up about it - I can't.

What I really wanted to share was this: breathe. Today I noticed something about myself I had never noticed before - every breath I take is too shallow. I'm nearing the end of an EMT course (finally doing something with my life) and I've learned many new things about the body I had never even considered before. When a person is experiencing trauma, the depth of their breathing naturally becomes more shallow as the rate of the breathing increases. This causes the oxygen level in the blood to drop and the brain is very sensitive to this drop. Deprived of oxygen, the brain doesn't function normally and anxious tendencies increase dramatically. After realizing my automatic breathing was too shallow, I began to purposefully breathe deeply with each breath. After a few minutes, I felt a tingling sensation in my face and scalp while noticing increased awareness of everything around me. I guess I could say I felt more lucid and more at ease.

Breathe more slowly and breathe more deeply. The normal respiration rate for a healthy adult is 12-20 breaths/min and the depth (we call it tidal volume) should allow the chest to expand almost completely. My chest was barely expanding at all on each breath, this is called dyspnea and is an early sign of compensated shock. I also don't drink a lot of water which adds to the problems. People always say I look pale which is another sign of shock. Living on the edge of shock, experiencing trauma every waking moment, that doesn't help anxiety at all.

Make sure you breathe properly, guys. :)",14,2012-10-19 06:45:21 EDT-0400

413,Great quote on why we worry and have anxiety,"""There are very few things in the mind which eat up as much energy as worry. It is one of the most difficult things not to worry about anything. Worry is experienced when things go wrong, but in relation to past happenings it is idle merely to wish that they might have been otherwise. The frozen past is what it is, and no amount of worrying is going to make it other than what it has been. But the limited ego-mind identifies itself with its past, gets entangled with it and keeps alive the pangs of frustrated desires. Thus worry continues to grow into the mental life of man until the ego-mind is burdened by the past. Worry is also experienced in relation to the future when this future is expected to be disagreeable in some way. In this case it seeks to justify itself as a necessary part of the attempt to prepare for coping with the anticipated situations. But, things can never be helped merely by worrying. Besides, many of the things which are anticipated never turn up, or if they do occur, they turn out to be much more acceptable than they were expected to be. Worry is the product of feverish imagination working under the stimulus of desires. It is a living through of sufferings which are mostly our own creation. Worry has never done anyone any good, and it is very much worse than mere dissipation of psychic energy, for it substantially curtails the joy and fullness of life."" ― Meher Baba, Discourses

Anxiety is nothing more than a thought which arises within your mind reminding you of a past event. A mere thought of a terrible thing that could possibly happen is all that separates us from anxiety and freedom. Learning to feel  and accept the pain of anxiety because you understand that it is nothing more than a jokester bringing up past fears is the key to recovery.",8,2012-10-21 06:38:17 EDT-0400

This is a big reason why I haven't sought help yet. I feel as though, when trying to explain my problems, they'll just sound so stupid and immature.

Working memory is our attention, effectively, so what we focus on or are thinking is using our working memory. My notes were saying when people are depressed or have anxiety issues their working memory is devoted to such thoughts (we all know this, when anxious I can't focus on anything and get stuck in a negative thought loop and come out depressed).
Anyway, the point of all this is that they said you can avoid intrusive thoughts by using your working memory to do something else like a number or word task in your head (This ones sort of obvious aswell, its the reason I play the alphabet game or do times tables everynight to distract myself for long enough to fall asleep). Anyway, there were studies done on it and of course using your working memory to do a task (or distracting yourself basically) meant you were less likely to feel intrusive thoughts, which would be great for all us folks on r/anxiety",5,2012-10-19 03:51:03 EDT-0400
425,How many of you use the internet as an escape from anxiety?,"For a long time now, I've been absolutely addicted to the internet. If I don't have something I NEED to do, I'm on the internet. This includes most of my time at work. When I'm not on the internet, I'm restless, anxious, and can't focus on anything, including conversations with people. I get extremely impatient, and even a little angry, internally, when someone engages me in small talk. The only thing that seems to help a little is drinking coffee, which doesn't really erase the anxiety, just gives me a little motivation. When I actually can make myself work on a project (such as music, drawing, cleaning, etc.), I lose attention within 30 minutes. I think it's anxiety-induced ADHD. I know I'm wasting my life spending so much time on the internet, and I really want to be able to accomplish things, but I can't break the habit.

428,I am completely proud of myself and what I just did.,"So, I am an anxiety sufferer for 8 years. I have not stood my ground for myself ever in the twenty and a half years I have been here on Earth and today I did. I realize that I may have been wrong in saying what I am about to say, but, I didn't think it was right.

I sold an Xbox 360 to someone and they ripped me off huge. HUGE. The next couple days, I go onto the site to look at ads and I find ALL of my stuff on that site. I am PISSED. I wanted someone to legitimately enjoy those games, not try and sell them for profit. So, I call the guy up and start talking to him about it and I said I want it back because I want someone to legitimately have fun with this stuff and not pawn it off to make profit. He said it was his stuff (which, he IS right, but I still decided to make a statement) and that he can do whatever he wants. Which, I was like, fine, you make a good point, but whatever. After talking back and forth a bit, I just ""Whatever, just have a good life"" and hung up. 

I started crying because I was upset and I was shaking from just standing up for myself. It was the first time I had ever done that. I then had a realization that positive things overrule negative ones because the previous day, a couple of people did really nice things yesterday and they were strangers and I just went instantly to thinking about that after what this guy had just done to me.

I am so scared of people. I am borderline agoraphobic and ya, I just wanted to post this because I have never felt so proud of myself. Also today was the first day that I was able to publish articles on a gaming website and get myself out there. Everyone loved my work and ya, I am just proud of what I had done today, and thought this was the appropriate place to post it,

433,"What is your ""safety blanket""?","In my English class when I was a sophomore, out teacher told us that when we are in panic, distress, anxiety, and/or depression, we usually go to a ""safety blanket"" that keeps us going, and basically tells us, sub consciously that we will be fine. He called this a ""safety blanket"" because when young kids are scared, anxious, and/or sad, they will usually go to their blanket when makes them feel better. 

Now fast forward to this week. Our sink was broken so whenever water was used the pipes underneath would leak. To hold all the water that leaked, for the sake of not ruining the cupboards and keeping away mold, we had to use the ""puke bucket"" to catch all the dripping water. The ""puke bucket"" is the bucket we take out and place by our bed when we feel like we are going to be ill or have been ill prior. To my best understanding a lot of people have a said ""puke bucket"". This week I realized that the ""puke bucket"" is my form of a ""safety blanket"" because a lot of my anxiety is emetophobia (fear of throwing up) and the ""puke bucket"" kind of eliminated the uncomfortable feeling to throwing up into a toilet. Not having this option was in the back of my mind most of the week and kind of enhanced my anxiousness a lot. 

So I guess my question to you guys is, what is your ""safety blanket""? Whether it be a medicine, stuffed animal, person, etc.",91,2012-03-25 05:08:18 EDT-0400

435,My timetable for the last day before a presentation,"i am pretty sure i don’t suffer from GAD, it is more a phobic thing.  In my last post to you guys,  i copied and pasted an email conversation between a lecturer and myself [here.](http://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/pulz9/i_think_that_was_my_first_real_call_for_help_and/)

There is a lot of backstory here, but I want to make this a long story short as I do not want to make this a megalong post, I have a fear of presenting, and I get anxious about any presentation as soon as I hear that I have to do it, even if it is months away, and the last week before it happensis excruciating. This is all about a presentation I had to deliver after a week’s worth of lab work.

needless to say the week was fucking stressful, and i knew that my usual bailing out wouldn't work. And that's when shit started to get real.
I realised I would need some medicinal help, and after getting hold of the right contacts, I had access to citalopram, xanax, diazepam and illegals. 

all i could think was that there must be a reason that most of these are difficult to get hold of even with a doctor. I made the decision to use xanax, as it was the only one I could feel safe taking and not passing out or falling asleep. Here is my timetable for the last day, although most of the days of that week felt like this.


**6.00am**- wake up, try to watch tv, but feel shaky and like adrenaline is being hosepiped into my veins

**7.30am** – force food down my neck, have to try hard as my stomach and brain aren’t helping. I do this so there is a base for the xanax

**8.00am** – take 0.25mg xanax

**9.00am** – arrive at uni, still feel tense as fuck, but start practising my presentation (I have already been practising for ages but have to do more)

**11am**- take 0.25mg xanax. I still feeling fucking edgy, but now it feels like backburner nerves, which is like a vacation in comparison to the full blown version. Practise some more

**12.30pm**- attempt to eat lunch, at this point any talk with other individuals is difficult, i just can not concentrate on anything other than the presentation

**1.00pm**- take last 0.25mg Xanax. If this bitch doesn’t work, Im fucked

**1.00pm-1.50pm**- practise some more

**2.00pm**- get to class in which presentation is held, there are 80 people in there. feel on even keel

**2.01pm** – class starts, there are many groups to go, so I find out I have to wait till we can present, so just sit there and listen to other groups presentations.

**2.01-2.40pm** – that even keel feeling vanishes. my body feels like it is on fire, WHY ARENT YOU WORKING XANAX! contemplate bailing and just running out the room, fuck the grade, fuck my group. But reason told me not to.

**2.41pm** – our group gets called up to go, I stand up thinking “oh holy shit” and repeat that sentence in my head until I turn to face everyone. 80 faces are looking at me

**2.41pm and a few seconds** – somehow, I switch off, my body lets go, I stop feeling nervous and it feels like a switch has changed in my head. I don’t question it, it feels great.

**2.47pm** – my turn to start talking (we are a group and have different sections of the presentation to talk about). I open my mouth and talk like you would talk to your friends, my brain remembers everything and I put my notes down while speaking (I made it obvious- to let the lecturers and guest lecturers see that I got this)

**2.52pm** – I stop talking, and feel like I have achieved something impossible, my fucking everest.

The rest of the story is incidental, but I want your opinions on the matter

**TL;DR – trials and tribulations of a 5 minute presentation for an anxious person**

**TL;DR point 2 – Xanax doesn’t help you with a presentation until the last fucking second**

440,"Attention students of r/anxiety: If your documented anxiety condition affects your performance in class, on assignments, or on exams, you are entitled to academic accommodations. Take advantage of them!","I'm working on a blog post with some thoughts on academic accommodations and it occurred to me that some of the information might be useful to you guys as well.

I'm a first-year college student with several conditions that have the potential to interfere with my academic performance, and having accommodations in place has been an absolute lifesaver on more than one occasion. Unfortunately, a lot of my classmates and friends at other schools seem to have no idea that you can apply for accommodations without having a more ""conventional"" learning disability, like ADD or dyslexia. This is not the case at all. If you have a condition for which you can provide documentation and reasons why it is a factor in your academic performance, you are entitled to accommodations.

My accommodations are in place for issues related to generalized anxiety, OCD, and bipolar disorder. They all have their own effects on my ability to perform--the anxiety makes me paranoid about other people finishing before me, time constraints, and randomly getting accused of cheating; the OCD makes multiple-choice bubble sheets absolute hell; and in hypomanic phases of bipolar exams tend to take longer than they should because I can't focus very well. My accommodations reflect these concerns: I get time-and-a-half so that I'm not as worried about not being able to finish and I have more time to get my act together if I'm having concentration issues or obsessively rechecking answers, and I get private testing space to reduce distraction and assuage my weird concerns about other people finishing before me or being wrongfully accused of cheating.

The dean in charge of my accommodations is absolutely wonderful. She's incredibly sympathetic, and during my first semester when I had a terrible anxiety attack the night before a midterm she answered the phone in the middle of the night and helped me arrange a private space for the next morning. I can't possibly express how helpful it is to have someone in the dean's office on your side and aware of your situation when things are out of control.

And for those of you who don't have a formal diagnosis or the means to get the required documentation, still go in and talk to someone about it. Because I didn't have the kind of neuropsychiatric testing that my college requires to formally document a mental illnesses, my dean gave me temporary accommodations for this year until I could get testing done. And as if that weren't enough, she applied for and secured funding from the college to cover my neuropsych evaluation costs, which would have been quite pricey otherwise. Thanks to her, I'll have testing that's up-to-date enough to get me the accommodations I need through undergrad and possibly even grad school depending on when I choose to go.

Even if you don't always use them, if you are eligible, **get the accommodations to which you are entitled.** You never know when you might need them. It is not ""special treatment"" in the way that some people imply, as if you're getting an advantage over other students. By definition, academic accommodations are intended to allow students to perform as well as they would be capable of performing were their disability not a factor in their ability to succeed. You deserve to have the same shot at success as anyone else, and accommodations can help make that a reality.

tl;dr: **Academic accommodations are an amazing resource that you should take advantage of if your anxiety (or any other condition) is affecting your academic performance. Don't be shy, it's your legal right to have them!**

Feel free to comment/message me if you have any specific questions about types of accommodations, documentation, talking to your deans and dealing with university bureaucracy, etc. I hope some people find this helpful!",6,2012-03-22 01:56:41 EDT-0400
441,Cortéz and his Burning Ships,"My dad told me something interesting last week.

Decide comes from a latin root that translates to ""cut off"". When you make a decision, you ""cut off"" all other options. When Hernán Cortéz landed in Cozumel during the Spanish Conquests, he burned all his ships so neither he nor his crew could turn back. He made a decision, and in making it had cut off any escape from that choice. 

I can't get what my dad said out of my head. It's a scary concept, right? Once you choose something, BAM, no turning back. Still, it gives a sense of power. ""This is what I'm going to do, and I'm only going to look forward.""

I'm not sure if it makes much sense, but it's kind of helped me.


Two weeks ago my long term boyfriend broke up with me... And last night I had sexy times with a guy I've had an incredibly complicated past with. Our dynamic changed. My life has changed. Everything, even non-romantic, has changed. I'm in a transitional part of my life right now.

After last night, he told me he had no regrets. He asked me how I felt, and I told him that when I closed my eyes I saw Cortéz and his burning ships.

There's no turning back, and I'm blindly moving forward. That's not entirely a bad thing.

I'm not sure how much sense this made, but I just needed to let that out.

If anyone ever needs a shoulder, I'm here, /r/anxiety. &lt;3",8,2012-03-26 02:35:10 EDT-0400
442,Anxiety Success Story!,"Warning: Long story, but helpful if you are struggling at the moment

I am a 23 year old male and since December 14, I have been suffering from what is known as a ""Nervous Breakdown"". It started out as a weird feeling, like a light-headedness that would never go away. I knew it probably due to anxiety because it was my finals at my university, and told myself it would go away after the finals week (which was the next week).

So, after finals week the feeling did not go away, it actually go much worse. I started feeling disassociated from myself (almost like I was watching my life happen from afar). Then, I started getting a constant headache. It felt like a burning feeling going from my temples to the base of my neck. Christmas came and went and it was not getting any better. In fact, it was getting much worse.

I started getting depressed every night. I would think about dying and it would make me cry for no reason. I always had the feeling that someone in my family was in trouble, or going to die. It was such a terrible time. I knew I needed to seek help, so I made a list of my symptoms (which came out to be over 20!), and went to the doctor.

The doctor started me out on Celexa 20mg and it started helping within the first week. After 6 weeks, almost all my symptoms were gone, except the darn light-headedness and depression! So, I returned to the doctor on Monday, and he upped my dosage to 40mg and ALL MY SYMPTOMS disappeared! 

I just wanted to share a success story and let anyone out there know that if you are struggling, it is going to get better! Just make the effort to get help!

443,How can I tell if I actually have an anxiety problem or if it's just me being a teenager?,[deleted],5,2012-03-27 07:50:54 EDT-0400
444,What's wrong with me? (Long),"First off, I know I need to see a professional but I can't afford it. 

I have these fantasies of myself an loved ones dying or being seriously hurt. Not a fantasy I want to have but an uncontrollable nightmare when I'm awake. I've had issue with that for as long as I can remember and it's worst at night and when I drive. It gets so bad that I cry as if it really happened. Sometimes I have to pull over because the feeling is do overwhelming, I can't breathe and feel like I'll pass out. Driving in general causes a strong sense of panic in me that's almost unbearable. 

Lately I'm finding that these fantasies are becoming for frequent and set off by little things. For example, when my boyfriend is at work we text throughout the day. There are several times he goes a whole without texting because he is working. I know this and it's never been an issue before but recently it sends me into a crazed state of mind. I start thinking all sorts of horrible things have happened. It happens with friends too, like if I call or text and try don't answer I go into one of my day nightmare things. 

Also, when things don't go according to plan, even a five minute offset will send me into this insane whirlwind of chaos. I feel like my world is collapsing. I call what I feel a wild fire because it starts so small and quickly escalates to the point here I feel like I should just stop existing. I have no intentions on killing myself. I know what I have to live for and I know these thoughts are absurd and temporary. The problem is that they become very frequent at times. I'll go a while without them, though still having the occasional panic feelings. But they always come back strong. 

I'm also having a lot of paranoia that everyone is hiding stuff from me and trying to make me out to be a fool. It's strongest in my relationship with my boyfriend, mainly because I talk to him the most. I completely trust him and every time I've had suspicious, completely unwarranted suspicions, I've been proven wrong. I don't question him because I know it's all in my head. Again, I experience the same thing with friends and family, hell even complete strangers. I sometimes question everyone's motives for any interaction I have with them. It's almost to the point where I want to run away and hide from the world. I force myself not to. 

I am generally a very happy bubbly goofy person. I love life and everyone in mine. I believe I am a very insightful and smart person. It's as if there are two of me and we are constantly at war. Is this anxiety, depression, or something more? Is there anything I can do to avoid these feelings? I know therapy is needed but like I said, I can't afford it right now. ",21,2012-03-28 17:25:33 EDT-0400
445,"Anxious, frustrated, or unhappy?  Take a closer look at your inner ""rules.""  ","Everyone has internal rules that they use to constantly ""ping"" against.  For example, you have internal rules about when you can be happy, and those rules probably are very different from mine, another person, or those who live in other cultures. 

If you've ever watched Real Housewives, you've seen a number of people whose internal rules require money, youthful looks, or expensive clothing before they can be happy.  This is a stark contrast to the homeless man on the street, or the child starving in another country, whose internal rules permit them to be happy if they have a warm meal and some shelter. 

A real problem arises when your internal rules require something impossible, highly improbably, or totally unpredictable before you will feel happy, relaxed, or good about yourself.  The student whose rule is that he cannot be happy with anything less than all ""A's,"" and the approval-seeking person who cannot be happy unless *everyone* likes him, are examples of people likely to remain anxious and disappointed in their lives.  

Take a look at your rules.  Ask yourself what you value internally, and whether you have rules that cannot be met or are unpredictable.  Ask yourself how you would feel if things were not perfect, or if someone didn't like you, or if you failed at something, or if you said something stupid a couple of times in front of other people.  If your rules require perfection in this areas, then you are playing a game that you simply cannot win.  Stop playing and change the rules.  

A closing semi-quote:  I recall some funny quote/metaphor used to demonstrate the pointlessness of trying to win an 'unwinnable' argument.  I think it also works to show how pointless it is to set internal rules that you can never meet.  Something like ""It's like trying to play chess against a pigeon; it will jump on the board, knock over the pieces, take a shit on the table, and strut around like it just won.  Why?  Because it doesn't play by the rules.""  ",7,2012-03-23 05:00:56 EDT-0400

Everyone else I know would just do it. Makes sense, doesn't it? Doesn't matter if the lecturer is disappointed as long as you get help.

So what seemingly small things (to people without anxiety) have you accomplished recently that you couldn't before, for whatever reason?",3,2012-03-25 20:21:36 EDT-0400
447,"Bit the bullet, and it tasted good.  New medicine, new doctors, A+++ would do again.","This ain't gonna be much of a post, quality-wise.  It's too early to tell if I'm really getting better or not.  But I feel like I might be, and having that new hope is a great, great thing to have with problems such as we have here.

So I got a therapist.  I live in a smallish town, so I don't know how good she is.  But I'm going every two weeks, and we're talking about ways to manage these intense negative and sometimes surreal feelings.  I also went to a psychiatrist.  I don't know much about his credentials, but I can tell he is a special man: he is in his eighties and still very dedicated to his art (he called it an art, specifically, which impressed me since I have always felt that way about medicine in general).  He put me on Vybriid, a new-ish antidepressant, and then also Abilify, which is a mood stabilizer.  The Abilify completely overwhelmed me with nausea the first day, and I felt somewhat like I just couldn't take it anymore. But I took some time out the next day (just in case I got sick again) and tried it again, and this time, the nausea was gone.  I felt a little weird but overall, kind of relaxed and not too shabby at all, really. 

So I'm on my seventh day of this new regiment, and things are looking up.  I still have some anxiety centered around school; today is my ""hell day"", as I have work all day and then school until 9:30 pm, so more or less a 14-15 hour day. I don't know for sure, but I feel like I might just make it through today pretty well.  And if not, I always have some klonopin to see me through - though my goal tonight is not to need them at all.  I'd really really enjoy being able to tell my folks and my wife that I got through a night of school without feeling like my world was collapsing around me, or that I would disappear forever, or however many other lame scenarios pop into my head when anxiety rises up.

Anyway. I'm remaining cautiously optimistic, because I know I've got a ways to go.  But I just look outside at this beautiful Georgia spring weather, and I soak in the sun for a few minutes, and I think to myself, damn, apart from all these kooky conservatives, today is a really really fine day!  I hope things are looking up for all of you soon too, and I hope we continue to just keep getting better and better. Thanks for reading.",2,2012-03-22 22:13:30 EDT-0400

449,New here.  Anxiety sufferer for years and years and it's finally starting to destroy me.,"So I'm on my own, 28 years going on 29, in grad school, thousands and thousands of miles away from my family.  Nuclear family split up, parents both loving and supportive but far away and married to new people.  I keep going through cycles where I'm on top of things, but then I nosedive right back down.  I haven't checked my mail in weeks, I am afraid to listen to my voice messages, and I'm in a constant state of panic over things that in reality I know aren't a big deal.  I tried to get help through the school, but they just told me they'd send me a list of therapists and never did.  I haven't had the time since to follow up - too much work to do at school.  

My one coping mechanism is food.  In the past year, I've gained 15 lbs, and while I'm not quite in the realm of ""fat"" yet, weight has been a lifelong struggle for me.  A few years ago I finally got active and was down to 165, now I'm back up to 180 and climbing and I sometimes feel like food is my only friend.  I don't have any other vices (pot makes my anxiety worse and I can't afford it or alcohol, which isn't worth the hangovers).

My girlfriend situation is worse.  She's got her own problems, and I knew I had to break it off because we were both miserable but she's a good kid at heart and she cried her eyes out and felt very bad, and now I feel worse because of it.  I just want to call her and tell her everything's okay, but it's not, because she slept with her ex boyfriend and has had the occasion to turn physically abusive (punching, etc) when she gets mad (bipolar?).  

I'm now petrified she'll find this and tell everyone at school...I realize this is all kind of one big run on sentence but when you're too afraid to pay your bills and leave your darkened apartment for NO GOOD REASON it kind of gets to you.

All of this was exacerbated by a very, very bad breakup a year ago with someone I really really liked.  Maybe the only person (I've dated a lot of girls) I've ever felt that strongly about.  I'm still working through it.

Help?  What in hell do I do?  Time is short because in one year I have to literally be lucratively employed or be destroyed by student debt (private and govt) and this anxiety is hurting my ability to do work, get a good reputation, and then get a job in my industry.

Instead of hijacking that poster's thread, here's a description of what agoraphobia is, from someone housebound for 5.5 years.","Before I start, please read http://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/123uma/i_havent_left_the_house_in_four_years_im_19/ and give the person some support.  They really need it.  My post is all about information.  That person could use some support first.

5.5 years housebound.  7.5 years with agoraphobia.  Wait, what?  That's one of the more puzzling things about agoraphobia.  You don't have to be housebound to have it.  Below are some other bits of information that might help people understand what it all means.

From the DSM-IV:
http://www.medicalcriteria.com/site/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=47%3Apsyagoraphobia&catid=76%3Apsychiatry&Itemid=80&lang=en

1.  Agoraphobia isn't ""fear of open places"", as is often believed.  Agoraphobia is about avoidance of places and situations.  And like potato chips, if you start avoiding one place or situation, you can't just have one, it usually spreads to other places or situations.

2.  Agoraphobics aren't always housebound.  Much of the time they are.  Before I became housebound, I was agoraphobic.  I only had to take one street to get to work, and I was unable to leave that street.  My commute was a few miles.  I avoided going anywhere off of that street.  Thats agoraphobia without being housebound.

3.  Many agoraphobics have a ""comfort radius"".  I can drive or walk about a half mile from home.  On good days, when the meds are working fine and I'm feeling adventurous, I'll go outside that zone.

4.  Not all agoraphobics have panic disorder.  There is a distinct diagnosis in the DSM-IV for agoraphobics without panic disorder.

5.  Sometimes other conditions are mistaken to be agoraphobia.  Social phobia is one - it has its own diagnostic criteria.  The results are the same, withdrawing from society and becoming more isolated, but using my story about my commute to work, I could have gotten off that one street if it was social phobia most likely.

6.  Probably the most important thing about being agoraphobic is that agoraphobic patients wind up not fearing the thing that made them agoraphobic.  They fear the resulting panic attack.  For instance, I fear driving far from home.  Not because I'm afraid of driving.  In fact, I enjoy driving very much.  I fear the panic attacks that result from driving.  This is the case with most people with the disorder.

7.  People with agoraphobia are liars.  This is extremely difficult, at least for me, because I don't want to be.  I'm an honest person by nature, but making excuses for not going and doing things has made me a liar.  In more recent years, I've decided to just tell people what I have.  It makes me feel better to maintain my integrity.  But the point still stands.  We make excuses better than most anyone you know.  And can generally manipulate any person or situation to gain equilibrium.

8.  Agoraphobia is extremely isolating.  That isolation leads to rumination, which leads to exacerbation of the symptoms, and in many cases, severe depression.  It's hard to be alone for so much o the day.  And it's humiliating to ask someone to do something for you that you should be able to do yourself.  It may sound like a lot of fun to be able to stay home and work, mess around, watch TV or whatever.  But the truth is, most of us are spending a lot of time thinking about what our lives have become and how we can make it better.  And that takes the fun out of lots of stuff.

If there's anything I missed, please add it in the comments.  I hope I've shed some light on agoraphobia and someone may find it useful.",38,2012-10-26 21:22:00 EDT-0400

457,Here's some of my thoughts on how to deal with anxiety. They may or may not help you.,"*Quick back story:* 

I'm a 28 year-old guy and I started feeling really bad anxiety symptoms about 2 years ago. I would describe myself as queitly confident and the anxiety just hit me out of the blue and was probably due to a particular period in my life about 4 years ago where 4 people I knew/were related to, died all within a 6 month span. I had also moved cities, went back to university, and was about to embark on a new career path.

*One thing I've learned:*

**Anxiety is horrible.** 

Absolutely horrible. And until you've experienced it, it's very hard to relate to someone with it. It eats away at your confidence and drains the colour from your life. For me, at its worst, every day became an exhausting battle just to be able to do very seemingly normal things.

I think the crux of it (for me, at least) is that I'm constantly worried that my body will do something and embarrass me. On the one hand I can see that this is a totally irrational fear but on the other, the fear is incredibly strong.

It's like anxiety likes to try and latch on to anything it can to induce the fear response and the ocd thoughts.

I'm gonna write out some of what I've went through (and am still going through). It's crazy and sometimes very laughable (and embarassing!) but here it is:

* fear of wetting myself
* fear that I'll get an erection
* fear that I'll ejaculate
* fear that I'll faint
* fear that my hands will noticibly shake

The fear of getting an erection is a very laughable one. But c'est la vie, it is what it is!

Personally this manifests in the desire to constantly check myself, especially when I'm wearing shorts in the gym.

""Am I getting an erection?""

""Is my penis sticking out?""

""Do I have a wet patch on the front of my shorts?""


People might be able to relate that these thoughts/feelings get worse when I'm in situations where I'm percieved to be trapped, i.e., driving with other people in the car, when I'm taking my coaching class, when I'm in class, when I'm sitting in lectures.

Here are some of my thoughts:

""What if I wet myself right in front of these people?""

""What if I get an erection? Does this mean that I'm a pervert? Is that a twinge a feel? Oh, god, am I getting hard? Jesus, what the fuck is wrong with me?""

All of these situations that I fear have happened exactly ZERO times in my life. They have occured many, many times in my head, but ZERO times in real life.

And that is why anxiety is a deeply irrational thing! But irrational or not, the fear response remains the same.

**So, how do I deal with it?**

* The very first thing is acceptance. Accept your body and accept your thoughts but - and this is extremely important - don't identify with them. Watch them almost like some sort of scientific experiment. Watch and accept.
* Make peace with the worst-case scenario in your head (this is obviously a very individual thing). Be ok with that worst case scenario:

""Ok, so tomorrow I'm gonna be giving some people a lift and I'm going to wet myself. Embarrassing? Yes, definitely. But the world'll keep on spinning, the sun will set, and tomorrow'll be a new day.""

When I consider that I'm on a floating rock surrounded by other members of my species and none of us know what the hell is going on, the insignificance of such an incident is mind-bogglingly small.

Now this is the difficult and scary step:

* Do everything you can to expose yourself to the fear. Really, really try to NEVER aviod a situation purely on grounds of anxitey and irrational fears. Everytime you do, you validate the fear and it grows a little stronger.
* YOU ARE A WARRIOR! When things are going crazy inside your body simply sit and breath. Do nothing else but feel the feelings, accept them, let them go, and breath. Do not try to aviod them and totally avoid any little safety-ticks that you have.
* Anxiety is a tricky little devil. It'll throw in a new bodily sensations to try and make you think that this time it's real! This time you're really gonna wet yourself! But be steadfast; do not be the first to blink! Anxiety is ultimately the wizard behind the curtain. Expose it for what it is.

For me, I want to so much look down and see if I've wet myself or if my penis is sticking out. But everytime I do, I validate it, and everytime I don't I weaken its grip on me.

And this is scary, believe me. Fear is fear, regardless of irrationality or not.

**In conclusion:**

Anxiety is perfectly normal. Trying to get rid of it is a goal that is rooted in failure because you won't. Ever. 

What we *can* do is reduce it back to a normal level because, for some reason or another, our anxiety dials have been stuck on high. For some, medication is a great way to get a handle on it, for others, it may be some sort of therapy. Our amygdala 'dial' may even revert back to a more normal level simply through time.

Our problem - and the reason we're different from other seemingly 'normal' people - is that we've become hypersensitive to our bodily sensations. Someone without an anxiety disorder has similar feelings but mostly they don't consciously register with them in the same way that they register with us.

Relax: the sensations are normal. Our body is a magnificent machine that takes care of an insane amount of tasks each and every second that we're alive. Try not to get too hung up or worried about a few twinges/tingles. Our body takes care of itself. You, by and large, are just a passenger.

460,What the eff is going to take to get people to understand this condition?,"Like, I don't know what to say to people. 

""You are just being lazy.""

Well ok, when I go outside and look at the car and want to get in, but I can't and I'm afraid that I'm going to get into a crash, and the size of the car makes me panic because it's small and I suddenly get claustrophobic and the thought of it sends me into a panic. Ok, I'm faking it. 

And when I can't eat half the time because my anxiety is so high, my throat feels like it's gonna shut off and I just can't handle it so I don't eat or do anything concerning hygiene for a week and then I feel a little better and it just cycles.

And god forbid not having a job, mom and dad and family. God forbid that I enjoy sitting here every day wishing my life wasn't wasting away and that I'm 31 now and can't even get out to go do something enjoyable without immediately coming home and being exhausted from even being near people. 

Jesus I can't handle it, how do people not know how this feels? This really is a ""walk a mile"" type thing. And you can't make people understand, you really can't. How do you make someone understand that you are physically and mentally incapable of doing things? And where's the compassion? 

Currently I'm living with a friend, because I was behind so far on bills, I finally just got a paying job and I had to sell my house and I'm basically living with roaches and fleas and nasty crap because my ""friend"" doesn't give 2 dits about the condition of his house and I'm left cleaning up all the messes (mention I'm a tad OCD too?) and I'm grateful that thank god I have a place to stay, and I'd do anything to help his mom, who's 70+ and can't do it herself but jesus.

What the hell is it going to take? I can't stay with my parents, my grandmother refuses to acknowledge this is a condition or illness at all. 

Anyways I'm done ranting. I'm sorry.",29,2012-10-24 06:05:24 EDT-0400
461,"[Relaxing] I don't really care if anyone reads this, but I feel really good right now and I want to share it.","For the past 3 days I've been having horrible panic attacks. They've left me completely on edge and exhausted all day long every day.

Today, I decided to educate myself and read a lot about anxiety and other people's experiences. Sometimes that's hard for me to do because thinking/reading about anxiety often GIVES me anxiety. I constantly find myself unable to convince myself that nothing is wrong with me, I'm constantly paranoid that something bad is happening/going to happen, that I'm going to die or something is wrong in one way or another. I did a lot of research on fight or flight response and how/when my triggers take effect. I get anxiety while driving, I get anxiety when I'm hungover, I get anxiety when I'm tired or didn't get enough sleep, I get anxiety when someone texts me a paragraph text while I'm driving and I can't read it or respond. I get anxiety when I can't type a text fast enough. I get anxiety when I write in my journal for a long period of time. I get anxiety that I'm going to get anxious around people and people will see me act crazy. I get anxiety when I think about my friends. I get anxiety when I think about my exbest friend and my exboyfriend. I get anxiety when I'm working and I'm scared that I'll get dizzy and crash into someone. I've done a lot of research and I thought I had social anxiety, driving anxiety, I thought I was a hypochondriac, I thought I had claustrophobia, I always think if I've drank the night before that I'm having alcohol withdrawals or I'm super unhealthy, that my ADHD medication is the reason for anxiousness (even though it's never ever been a problem in my 10 years of being on it)... but because I've thought ALL of those things and I relate to each and every single one of those and I know it's unlikely it's ALL of them, I've discovered that it might just be more specific than that. I've narrowed it down and think that I've discovered that what I have is [anticipatory anxiety](http://panicdisorder.about.com/od/symptoms/a/anticianxiety.htm). This means that all of those thoughts/symptoms that I have that fall under each of those categories are all just me anticipating/worrying the worst in each situation. I anticipate and worry in ALL of them.

For the first time I don't feel as crazy. I've read so many of your guy's posts and responses and can relate to ALL of you. For me, this whole anxiety/panic attack thing for the last year and 6 months has left me feeling so alone and different from anyone. I always thought no one understood me and therefore I felt completely lost. For once, I feel like I'm not lost. I feel more confident that I'm going to be okay. That if I have a panic attack, it's going to be okay.

Reading about the ""[Fight or Flight Response](http://www.thebodysoulconnection.com/EducationCenter/fight.html)"" really helped me put my anxiety and my constant ""worrying"" into perspective. I encourage you all read this from time to time, and THINK hard about it and let it be comforting to you that your body is doing this to try to protect you, not hurt you. Try to make yourself believe that worrying about your body doing this to you is what's making your body do that to you. You should accept that your body does this because it's an amazing, complex and beautiful thing. You're body knows how to save itself when you let your mind play a trick on it. You're not crazy. You just have a hard time sometimes. I'm not crazy. I just struggle with my thoughts. I feel for you all, you're not alone. 

I'm deciding right now that I'm going to pick myself up. I'm going to do things for myself that make me feel good and not worry when I'm doing them. I'm going to shower every morning and get ready/do my makeup, straighten or curl my hair EVEN if I'm not going anywhere and don't have anything to do. I'm going to make my bed after I get up, I'm going to give myself manicures and pedicures when I'm bored.. I'm going to floss more, I'm going to hang up my paintings in my room, I'm going to wear lipgloss and not feel like I'm ""wasting"" it because no one is seeing me with it on. I'm going to do all these things.. and it's going to feel nice.

Anxiety sucks balls... but I feel good today. :D

If I take anymore of my meds, I'm pretty sure I will fall asleep from them. (I take 2mg Klonopin and 30mg Lexapro - so far this has been the best treatments.)

468,I am overcoming my anxiety and want to help others.,"Hi everyone,

I am just getting over about a year of severe panic and anxiety. It got so bad at one point that I wouldn't eat anything but peanut butter and jelly or mac and cheese (my panic attacks started after having what I thought was an allergic reaction to a food). I wouldn't attend parties or travel unless I had my own transportation.  I almost lost my relationship with my SO of 5 years.

The good news is that I've overcome the worst of my panic and anxiety, although I am still working on expanding my comfort zone. I want to offer encouragement to anyone out there who is struggling because for months I honestly thought there was NO WAY I would ever recover. This isn't true!! You can do it. The solution is different for everyone, and there is no magic ""cure', but you CAN recover.

Now, I want to help others with anxiety in some way. Giving back to others really gives me a sense of peace and I think it would help my progress. I'm not sure how. Any ideas? I can't donate any money. ",13,2012-10-24 15:43:01 EDT-0400
469,[Help] Self Defeating School Anxiety,"I am currently in my senior year of college and I hate the way school makes me feel.

I get especially anxious about interactions with professors and going to class. Which gets much worse when my brain comes up with a thousand possible (all negative) outcomes.

This anxiety has cost me many grades and I fear my current grades. I have many interests but without drive and the ability to cope I fear I am limiting myself.

470,[Relaxing] Embrace your body and what it does.,"I am 20f. I have had diagnosed GAD, SAD, and Hypochondria since I was very young. I have been on medicine. I have gone (and still go) to a therapist. I have done hypnosis. I have tried all sorts of diet and exercise plans. And you know what? I AM STILL ANXIOUS.

And so I have been thinking about that a lot. Why am I still anxious when I have utilized every resource available to feel better? I still have daily panic attacks. I still have nervous tics. I have been wondering if I am just more sick than others or if I have some sort of other disease that inhibits the treatment of my anxiety. It is a worry that is always on my mind (and probably hinders the very treatments that I am so worried aren't working). 

I came to a realization  that I want to share with all of you fine people. My body (and yours too) is totally amazing. It does all of these cool things all the time. It has patterns and processes that work in incredibly intricate ways. It fucking rocks! 

I spend so much time worrying that something is wrong with my body. I don't acknowledge all the wonderful things that it does. I fill it full of pills and punish it. My body and I have been enemies for so long. But not anymore. Today, I resolve to embrace my body and what it does and you should consider doing the same. 

Take a moment to think about how awesome it is. Next time you have a panic attack or think you are sick you will remember how it always does its best to look out for you. Your body is not a bad guy. Utilize it to overcome your anxiety. Next time you feel panicked trying feeling the air go in and out of your lungs or feel your muscles move under your skin. Remind yourself that you and your body work together. 

Two weeks ago I started dreadlocks. I was initially really nervous that I would mess them up, but now I watch my crazy frizzy hair change everyday and it reminds me of these things. Even my hair has processes that are wonderfully natural and normal. Maybe there is something radical you can do that will always serve as a reminder to embrace your body and accept what it does even when it feels wrong.

things we are trying to do all the time:

* be safe

things we can’t help but do all the time:

* second-guess ourselves
* behave impulsively and reactively
* take everything personally
* worry
* have difficulty accepting compliments
* have difficulty reciprocating friendly gestures
* worry
* have difficulty finding the courage to respond
* have difficulty not being suspicious of others’ intentions
* worry
* make a huge deal out of the smallest thing
* think we're bothering you

things you should keep in mind:

* we’re scared of everything
* pretty much all of the time
* it’s an actual disorder
* it manifests as impulsive behavior
* you can’t fix us with words
* telling us “worrying is silly” won’t make us stop worrying
* it’ll only make us feel silly
* and then we’ll worry even more
* “oh god, am i worrying too much? what if they call me silly again?”
* like that
* also, we wear a lot of armor
* cold, heavy, affection-proof armor with spikes
* we constructed this armor as children
* we’re fairly certain you will never be able to pry it apart
* but there is a nice person under there, we promise

things you can do for a friend with an anxiety disorder:

* stick around
* ask them if they’re comfortable in a place or situation
* be willing to change the place or situation if not
* activities that help them take their mind off of things are good!
* talk to them even when they might not talk back
(they’re probably too afraid to say the wrong thing)
* try not to take their reactions (or lack thereof) personally
(the way they expresses themself is distorted and bent because of their constant fear)
(and they know this)
* give them time to respond to you
* they will obsess over how they are being interpreted
* they will anticipate being judged
* it took me four hours just to type this much
* even though i sound casual
* that’s because i have an anxiety disorder

things you shouldn’t do:

* tell us not to worry
* tell us we’ll be fine
* mistake praise for comfort
* ask us if we are “getting help”
* force us to be social
* force us to do things that trigger us
* “face your fears” doesn’t always work
* because—remember—scared of everything
* in fact, it would be more accurate to say we are scared of the fear itself

emergency action procedure for panic attacks:

* be calm
* be patient
* don’t be condescending
* remind us that we’re not “crazy”
* sit with us
* ask us to tighten and relax our muscles one by one
* remind us that we are breathing
* engage us in a discussion (if we can talk, then we can breathe)
* if we are having trouble breathing, try getting us to exhale slowly
* (it will be harder for us to exhale than inhale)
* (sometimes all it takes is our body to realize it can push the air back out)
* or breathe through our nose
* or have us put our hands on our stomach to feel each breath
* or have us put a hand on your chest and breath with you
* ask us what needs to change in our environment in order for us to feel safe
* help us change it
* usually, just knowing that we have someone on our side willing to fight our scary monsters with us is enough to calm us down

if you have an anxiety disorder:

* it’s okay.
* even if you worry that it’s not okay.
* it’s still okay. it’s okay to be scared. it’s okay to be scared of being scared.
* you are not crazy. you are not a freak.
* I know there’s a person under all that armor.
* and i know you feel isolated because of it.
* I won’t make you take it off.
* but know that you are not alone.

I've only posted comics on here, and that I understand downvoting. But people just saying how they feel, reaching out to others, especially when we're all obviously not feeling that confident, to recieve a downvote makes me ... angry i guess.

487,[HELP] Anxiety about driving is ruining my life,"I am a male in his mid 20s. Financially everything is ok. I am going to school where I am making the grades I want. Family life is ok. Not on any meds.

I have sought counseling in the past for anxiety issues. I am not sure if I was ever diagnosed with anything, they never told me. My anxiety has never lead to situations where I feel my life is in danger until now.

Almost a year ago I was driving on an interstate on my way to school when I nearly fainted (pre-syncope?). I tried to rationalize that I hadn't eaten very well that day and I had stayed up late the previous night working on an assignment. I was worried about a root canal surgery I needed and how I was going to pay for it (I have health insurance but my portion was very expensive. I think just random stresses from life can trigger this.

Ever since then, every couple of months, I'll have an episode where I am driving and I encounter a stressful driving situation and suddenly it feels like I will lose control of my body and car.

I have never fainted and never consciousness and each time I have had this happen I maintain enough control to pull over to the nearest exit and take the backroads home. I have never had an accident.

Here comes the anxiety part. I sometimes feel (like now) this dreadful feeling about interstate driving. Right now I am safe at home and all I can think about is if I will have another episode on my way home from work or to school. It feels like my heart is sunk in my body and and my fine motor movements like typing and writing are a bit off and shaky.

The situations where this happens have been expanding. First it would only happen when I drove from work to school. Through a very urban driving environment. Then it started happening when I drove from work to home (urban to suburban driving). It has never happened on my way to work.

I have had enough and I am calling my primary care physician tomorrow to make an appointment to see if there is a physiological basis for what I am experiencing but I am worried that he will shrug it off and tell me my problem is that I just need to eat better and exercise. Until I can find the help I need I feel like I am on my own.

I don't know what to do! I have done breathing exercises, played video games to distract myself, had a drink or two to hopefully calm down.

I can't get my mind off of it. If I continue feeling like this I am sure I'll have another episode tomorrow.

r/Anxiety I need your help

edit:forgot a few words

*Edit 2:* I learned about valerian root and how it helps some people's anxiety. I took some and I am feeling better. Hopefully I can use this tomorrow when it's time to drive to school so feeling like I have a strategy really feels empowering. Thank you all for your help. ",26,2012-09-24 01:40:18 EDT-0400
488,"The one thing holding my life back is my relationship. It makes me so anxious, but I feel almost consumed by anxiety when I think it might end.","I worry this should go into /r/relationships, but in truth, I feel this topic is a little too... deep(?) to be regarded as a normal ""relationship"" problem. I worry it may be rooted further in my childhood/background (and his) than simply be a clash. But I am so new to this physical sense of anxiety that I'm not very wise at all.

I am *so* tired of being sad, feeling helpless, doubting myself and hiding from my friends. For what soon has been the better part of a year, I've felt this way. With the help of my mother, I've decided that it ends here. I *can* be beautiful, my interests *do* matter, I'm *not* stupid and I *can* achieve what I want in life. Just not at this moment.

As I assess these issues, I realise something extremely disconcerting. Most of this anxiety stems from my relationship. While I can't, won't, don't blame the guy himself - and I love him more than anything, I wouldn't ask for anyone else - I worry that he is the source. He is so angry, all the time, and very aggressive in his opinions. Unfortunately, he himself struggles with dissatisfaction in life, and he often goes on minute-long rants about how shit everything is. Even the things I enjoy. His anger makes me want to turn around, run away, and plug my ears while closing my eyes.

While he doesn't necessarily target me with the intention of making me feel shit and insignificant (I hope), he really does. I can't get a word in edgeways without being shot down as a dramatic and/or being unreasonable, illogical or stupid. My feelings are inferior to his rational mind. I experience him to be extremely cold and unsympathetic. I long for someone to hold me, protect me, support me and just be nice and positive - but I don't want *anyone else* to do that. I want him to. When I then naturally wander to other social circles to fulfill these wishes (not cheating at all), he takes offense to the friendly banter. He thinks I'm flirting with people, that they view me as a single girl. I struggle with confrontation and while I understand some comments are inappropriate, I couldn't stand shooting someone down with dismissal. I re-direct, but in truth, it's nice to feel appreciated and desired.

We had another blow-out that's put me in a mindset I worry is destructive. I've told him that he needs to make his mind up and consider whether he truly loves me (as he claims, he doesn't want it to end and seems very disheartened by this thought) because he doesn't seem like he respects or cares for me. I fear I come across the same way to him.

So I brace myself for the worst, and I just feel so anxious all the time, constantly. What is he doing? What is he thinking? I prod him to communicate more with me, he just apologises (for not doing so) and then there's nothing more of it. I can't help but wonder if I am unable to recover from my anxiety as long as I'm with him, but I can't even begin to explain the physical pain I feel at the thought of it.

I've asked (but not requested) medicine solution, but they say that ""talking"" should be the first hand choice. I feel that I can't solve this by talking to any outsiders, and my boyfriend won't talk to me enough that it matters.

I just can't seem to figure out whether the anxiety is the ""chicken or the egg"" in this case. 

**tl;dr - relationship making me very anxious. How can I make the right decision while my mind is so clouded by doubt and worry? Am I ruining this relationship, or is it ruining me? How can I tell?**

Throwaway account to stay anon, sorry about that.

**Edit**: As a side question, I find that I've become almost sickeningly empathic along with this anxiety/emotional duress. I feel myself sometimes tearing up when I read some of the posts around here, it can be simple things like methods of calming yourself etc. Is this a side effect of anxiety or am I just an exaggeratedly sensitive person?

*Hello /r/Anxiety, first time posting here. I need some advice/suggestions and would like to know if anyone else suffers in a similar way to me and how you managed to deal with it. This post whilst being used to reach out to others in a similar situation as well as gaining advice and thoughts will be used to help me collect and compile my thoughts into one location that I can copy down and use as some sort of transcript when speaking with a doctor. I know it's big but I wanted to cover all grounds and try and answer any questions and provide information to you that you may want. I've broken it all down into categories so you can read the bits that interest you. It would be great to get some feedback, even if you don't read it all.*

**TL;DR: Anxiety causes me bad gut cramps and makes me shit badly, it is caused by just thinking about and actually leaving the house, even if it's to take a 1 minute walk to a postbox. Longer durations cause more stress.**

I haven't been told by a doctor that I suffer with anxiety but I think my symptoms (I will get to these shortly) are a clear indication of this. My anxiety is directly linked to my bowels which I've dealt with for nearly 8 years in silence. I only came out to my parents on the seriousness of the issue a few years back and need to get medical help. Anyway, I'm not sure how to structure this post, everything is all inter-connected and all over the place. I'll start with a bit about me.

---

**About Me**

Currently, I am a 21 year old Male in the UK. I am about to go into my 3rd year at Uni. I have dealt with my anxiety as it is listed below for nearly 8 years. I place the event that started it towards the back end of October 2004. Some stupid school/childhood trauma that I place at the foot of all of this, I could be wrong. I'll write the details up at the end if anyone is curious. I'm about 5'10"" and weigh in at ~(8st|50.80kg|112lbs). Very underweight, not sure if this is related to my symptoms at all (I eat lots).

---

**My Triggers**

To begin the horrible anxiety crash course, all I need to do is merely think about either going outside. This ranges from going places in the car - to sitting in a university lecture - to walking to the postbox and back. Leaving the house causes anxiety, thinking about leaving the house causes anxiety. This is somewhat related to the worry of getting caught-short and needing the toilet where there isn't one. (The symptoms complicate this, see below).

---

**My Symptoms**

Symptoms I can deal with:

- Faster, shallow breathing.*^1
- Nausea.
- Feeling like I could be sick.

Symptoms I cannot deal with:

- Horrible gut cramps that force me to clutch my stomach in pain, these come and go in a way that can only be described as contractions lasting from 20s - 60s and coming as often after one another as the time they last.
- A sudden and alarming urge to take a poop. (The urge is very real) *^2

*^1 I'm not sure if this is a symptom or my response as a coping mechanism.

*^2 My stool is firm and fine when I am not anxious. As soon as the anxiety kicks in it will liquefy there and then. Never had a hard stool while anxious. My anxiety involves holding back diarrhea. You can now see my problem.

It takes a great deal of mental (keep doing what I'm doing and remaining around my trigger) and physical strength (keeping that sphincter shut (see *^2 above)) to push past this. It should be noted that once the trigger has gone, ie: I get back into the safety of my house: my cramps stop, the urgent need to poop goes and the other symptoms just vanish. It's at this point I become fine.

---

**About My Attacks**

Once we get to about 30 minutes before I need to leave the house to attend university classes, my symptoms start. I will go to the toilet for a poop (as stated earlier, these are real urges with something behind them) and will poop about 3 times before finally leaving the house. (15 mins before leaving, 10 mins before leaving, 5 mins before leaving, etc... (not concrete times)). This is the point where I'll decide if I can continue, if I feel too bad, I will stay at home and skip the day, which makes me feel bad since once I decide to stay at home, the symptoms just stop. Should I venture onwards, it is at this point I'm usually just feeling sick, nauseous and be breathing quickly (going to the toilet has calmed the guts down for now). At this point, the bowel troubles could start up again. The worst feeling is sitting in class/lecture stuck in by other people while waiting for it to start, knowing that it could come back with a vengeance. Not nice when you're going to be stuck there for 1 hour. Whilst I can go to the toilet and this offers some relief, it doesn't always stop the problem. I can go to the toilet and feel great afterwards, until it comes back again. Other times I can go to the toilet and still be in pain. Truly horrible. The only cure for this problem is to remain at home - Not something that is going to be possible for me.

Thankfully my family and friends fully understand what I go through and never rush me. They encourage me and convince me everything's going to be all right. The sad thing is that it doesn't help, my problems don't go away and I continue to experience them on a daily basis.

---

**My Current Stance**

So right now once I get back up to university, I'm going to go back to the doctors. I've been before but I was going there with the intent to sort out a bowel problem*^3 and didn't place the focus on anxiety which after much reading leads me to believe that is the cause. I hope with this stance and changed approach to my problem that I can get the help I need to overcome my problem.

I find it hard to force myself to attend university classes or group meetings when walking there, sitting there and going back lead to the symptoms I described above. This is wrecking my life and I need it sorting quickly. How can I attend my graduation with this problem? If it's not under control, I will skip it. Travelling to and from university (nearly 3 hours drive) is the bane of my nightmare and I'll be doing this on the upcoming Sunday.

*^3 Was given Mebeverine 135mg as a stomach relaxant. Worked for a while but my worry eventually rendered them useless and the problems persisted. Continued to take it as a way of convincing myself it would help, though I'm not convinced with those efforts.

---

**Where do I place the cause for this?**

Back towards the end of October 2004, I was in school and we were doing a small test in class that was used to assess how we were doing with learning German. Our normal teacher wasn't there and we had another covering for it. I sat there in pain, really needing the toilet - Yet I didn't ask until I really had to go and that I couldn't hold out until the end of class. My request to go to the toilet was rejected and I sat there suffering in pain for about 15 minutes before she looked up, saw me looking as white as a sheet and then had the cheek to ask me if I wanted to go to the toilet. She sent someone with me thinking I would faint when I went downstairs. Anyway, I unloaded and completely destroyed the toilet (it was very messy) and then I felt relief. Since then I've had my problems. I blame that woman. She doesn't even know how much she's screwed me up. It makes me so angry.

---

**I ask you:**

- Do you deal with bad bowels as a symptom to your anxiety?
- If yes or no, doesn't matter, how do you deal with you anxiety, what do you do to push past and through the rough parts of it?
- Does my symptoms meet the requirements to be considered an anxiety ""attack""?
- What kind of anxiety disorder would you put this down to? (8 years of suffering when the same triggers fire makes this hard to believe it can't be a disorder).
- To those who have gotten help from a doctor, how would you advise me to convey my problems in a way that will stress my urgency? The shitting problems need to go and they need to go very soon.

491,"If anxiety is fear and fear is not understanding, is knowledge/education the cure for anxiety?","I've almost certainly got some sort of anxiety disorder, though I can't know for sure since I've been unable to communicate my problems with my doctor. I'm 25 and I've been dealing with these problems since I was about 10 or 11. Every time I go to the doctor I feel hopeful and leave disappointed and hopeless. 

I have some paranoia about it, I think that the doctor is not treating me because he works for the state (I'm in Canada) and they want me to die because I'm not productive. My parents deny that there's anything wrong with me and have always dissuaded me from seeking help. ""You just need a job"" is their answer for everything. I've had jobs, they don't last very long. I can work, I would work but it's pointless if I'm just going to be a fearbag and lose the job anyways.

I'm about an hour away from calling for my first doctor's appointment in over a year. I don't want it to be like all the other times. If I leave there again unsatisfied I don't think I'll ever make it back. I'm 6'2, 130 pounds and dropping. I try to shop at the market but often walk by because I don't want to interact with the vendors. 

Other things too. I don't want to be institutionalized. My thoughts are chaotic. 

I don't really believe that my doctor is conspiring against me, I'm aware that this is probably/definitely not the case. They're just paranoid thoughts that I can come close to believing but I never really lose sight of what the truth probably is.

503,Hey r/anxiety this is something that has worked wonders for me! An anxiety totem.,"I have struggled with anxiety and depression for most of my life having severe panic attacks multiple times a week. Anyone who has had a panic attack knows the vicious cycle of them, you panic and as there is no actual danger to speak of you think that maybe something is wrong with you (cancer, heart failing, psychosis etc) which in turn makes you MORE anxious extending the panic attack and making it worse. After becoming familar with this feeling after years of attacks I started to notice that all of the symptoms were the same with each attack, and afterwards I would feel almost silly for freaking out so much. I knew this was all in my head and nothing was actually wrong, mostly I was just feeling the physical effects of the panic attack so here's where I got creative. After watching the movie inception I was fascinated by the idea of their totems, the objects they would use to determine if what they were experiencing was real or not. So one day when my anxiety was very, very low I decided to get one. In my current mental state I KNEW that nothing was wrong with me and the feelings I was experiencing were not actually real but,that sometime soon I would loose that perspective and start thinking that there was. I took an old brass key and started creating a mental way point of sorts, when I was having an attack I would hold the key and remeber that in a much better mental state I had determinded that nothing was wrong and that I would be just fine as soon as the attack passed. The key serves as a metaphor for me, I imagine myself shutting a door between myself and the fear that I am feeling and locking it. I then imagine myself turning around an unlocking a door that contains positive thoughts. I found this silly until it actually worked, and has been working every since. I trust that when i'm in the middle of an attack I am in no state to determine if something bad is actually happening and when I'm not having one I find it almost silly I could get so worked up. So I suggest you all try this, find a small object that you can keep on your person and spend some time focusing on it and reminding yourself that you are okay. When a bout of anxiety hits take out your totem and hold it in your hands while taking some deep breaths while reminding yourself that in a much better state you knew you were okay and that this feeling will pass.

507,"My personal Top Ten Tips that really help, mid panic attack. ","I get panic attacks all the time, at first they were crippling, but now I have much better control. Here are my best tips on what to do in a panic attack.

1. Make a phone call. Doesn't have to be long, but call someone who is not a friend. Maybe call a restaurant and ask their hours, or call your cell phone company and complain about something. 

2. Do a math equation in your head. If my wife notices that I am obviously having a panic attack, she will grab my hand and say 'honey, what is 35 times 17' not like I am rainman or anything, but this really helps. It takes just long enough for my brain to completely change gears.

3. Take a huge breath, and hold it for 30 seconds, while flexing every muscle in your body. Also really helps if while you do this, you think about someone or something that really makes you angry. 

4. Diet and exercise. Caffeine has gotta go, also, get out and run until you think you will pass out, or ride a bike up a huge hill. I always feel much better, and this can give a lasting 24 hours of relief. 

5. Acupuncture. This helps relax you, and is amazing what a few needles poking at you can change in your mentality. 

6. Meditation. Every morning I wake up and pee, then go back into bed in the lotus position and try to meditate for at least 30 minutes. This really helps me keep steady all day. Seriously, google the science behind meditation, and learn it. Its your best tool.

7. Stay away from Xanax. This is a temporary band-aid which over time will make it worse. Try some herbal remedies. 

8. Have a couple cocktails.  I find just 2-3 totally takes away the symptoms, and I can do whatever I want then. (don't drive drunk).

9. Don' let your eyes wander around, and don't look at strangers. This can blow the top off of whatever control you thought you had. 

10. If you feel you need to bail, set a time limit. So, if I am really not doing well, and need to abort whatever I was doing, look at the time, and add 3 minutes. Say, I am going to abort if this doesn't get better in 3 minutes. Many times it will!

Good luck!

Edit: Here is a bonus tip: When you feel it coming on, try to keep your thoughts restricted to only what is happening in your immediate reality (every second stay in the present moment strictly), also try to keep your consciousness to encompass your whole body, instead of your brain. Then, when you know you have done that, write down what happened, what you did, and how it felt. Beating anxiety is way harder the quitting cigarettes or even cocaine. So, ring the whole army to the battle. But don't get lost in it. ",22,2012-07-25 03:07:37 EDT-0400
508,25 ways to decrease anxiety,,3,2012-07-23 01:06:16 EDT-0400
509,As requested: beating the anxiety,"Someone said there were too many negative posts on this subreddit, and not enough positive stories. Therefore I'd like to share this with you all. A little background first.

My story begins in a land known to many of you, the land of social anxiety. Some 6 years ago (I was 16 at the time) I moved from my quiet little place with a lot of friends, even had some girlfriends (I was a cute kid), to this horrible land. Gradually it got worse, and while I was still in high school, all my friends went off to college and I was left behind, not really capable of making real friends. A year later I myself went to college, moving away and starting a life of my own. The first year was hell. I didn't go to classes, didn't make any exams, I don't even remember how I got through the day really. It was the blackest year in my whole life. I remember one time, I invited someone I knew from high school to my appartment, but once she was there, I had to send her away, because I felt like shit. I never spoke to her since, and I don't think I ever will... But that's a whole other story.

During that year, I started going to the university's therapist. But that didn't help at all, so she sent me to the city's mental health institution (ggz) and I started therapy away from school, just before the summer holidays. We spent all summer preparing for the new year, and during that time, I had a sort of epiphany. I was determined to start the year well, at all cost. 

So I met with a psychiatrist and we agreed that I would go all out on my medication the first few weeks (I was on 40mg citalopram, which was raised to 60, and I would take 0.5mg xanax every day). That was, looking back on it, probably one of the greatest weeks of my life. I was so proud of what I did. A new environment, new people, classes, I had it all. 

But of course, it didn't end there. that was 2 years ago now, and I'm still fighting. It did help me get over that one hurdle, and now I'm improving my social skills. I'll never fully get rid of the anxiety, but I can remove it from my daily life. Only when I do something different, I get anxious.

Ending on a high note from last week. For the first time in my life, I asked a girl out on a date. It was one of the toughest things I ever did. Unfortunately, she said no, but that didn't stop me from feeling very proud of myself.

Anyway, I'm sorry for the rambling, it felt great writing this and I couldn't stop. I don't really care if anyone reads this, I feel great now. ",24,2012-07-27 14:53:53 EDT-0400

511,I lost it at work tonight and made a fool of myself and I don't know what to do now.,"I was working a pick-up shift at work (a ""gentlemen friendly"" restaurant) tonight when one of my customers made a really innocent comment about my ass. By ""innocent"" I mean he was trying to be friendly/flirty, not perverted/insulting. It should have been nothing. It should have meant nothing. But as I walked back to the kitchen to place his table's order I suddenly found myself out of breath. In a bad way.

I felt my pulse and it was hammering like crazy. I started to get dizzy. But as my therapist always says ""Fight it and remain calm"". So I placed the order and pretended everything was okay. I started to think about this one book I'm reading, trying to calm myself that way and separate my mind you know? But then I heard, or think I heard, another customer say ""Let's be nice to her.. all tits and no brains, not her fault"".

Turns out the runner to that table brought out the wrong flavored wings (it's not her fault, she's new and still learning the table numbers). I apologized but I felt myself sweating. This one guy, probably in his early 20's I'd guess who might have been the one to make the earlier comment, smiled at me and said I should relax. I was obviously sweating. For a brief moment I started to take his advice due to his kind words but then he suddenly grabbed my butt as I turned to go back to the kitchen to fix their order.

That's when I totally lost it. I had a full blown attack right there in the middle of the bar room. 

I couldn't breathe at all. I grasped at my neck and dropped my pad and fell to my knees. Everything was spinning. I was so scared. I didn't lose consciousness but I kept thinking I would as one of the AMs and another waitress tried to help me up. The waitress, by the way, tugged at my shirt though I didn't realize it at the time.

Later I found out that the shirt was torn. I'd been clawing at it so much during my attack that I exposed most of my bra by tearing at the well washed top.

After I finally calmed down the AM told me I should go home. But he wouldn't let me drive. He doesn't know that I'm in treatment for anxiety disorder or anything like that and I'm worried he thinks I was on drugs or something. But I wasn't. I honestly wasn't. 

Things have been rough for me lately and my psychiatrist has been weaning me off of klonopin b/c she doesn't think it's been helping and she wants to try something else (I don't know what). So maybe that's part of it. But I wasn't drinking and I wasn't on drugs. But for a few minutes there I honestly thought I was going to die. And I lost it. Totally totally lost it.

Now I don't know what to think.",24,2012-07-23 09:07:51 EDT-0400

516,"Please help. Emotionally abusive relationship, can't cope woth staying OR leaving, breaking down","I am in a long term (six year) relationship which has progressively become emotionally abusive over the last two years and has now hit an absolute limit for me. My partner has become increasingly obsessed with work, other friends, etc and I have slipped so far on the priority list that he constantly makes me feel like it is a chore for him to spend any time with me at all (for example, we spend about one hour a day together on average, and he is constantly telling me that I am too ""demanding"" of his time.. Sorry, but in a six year relationship I do not think that a few hours together a week is too much to want, in fact it is barely enough to keep a relationship going in my opinion). 

Last night we got into another huge fight (during which all sorts of past fights, some from more than two years ago, were brought up and re-argued, since we are completely incapable of fighting normally lately). He basically presented me with a list of demands for what HE wanted (never enquired what I needed from the relationship) and said ""if you can't deal with it, just leave"". At several points he said that he didn't care about my emotions, and went so far as to say ""well your feelings are crap"". At one point when I was trying to open up to him about my fear and anxiety I broke down and started to cry, and he immediately began yelling at me for crying and telling me to just ""deal with it"" (my anxiety and social problems).

Reddit, no one needs to tell me that this is a toxic relationship. That much is obvious to me. But my problem is that I have severe anxiety about leaving (possibly even greater than my fear of staying). I am living in a country where I literally don't have any social support network apart from my partner, his friends and family. If I leave, the reality is that I will have no one and nothing, and will struggle to support myself financially and probably fail to support myself emotionally. I have zero faith in my ability to cope here completely isolated, and I don't make new friends easily so I am desperately afraid that I will be completely alone forever. Even thinking about all of the consequences of leaving him as I type is, I am crying uncontrollably and having trouble breathing. I don't know what to do as there doesn't seem to be any option at all. I am desperate and am worried I might do something stupid.

Edit: thank you to everyone who has replied so far. I feel completely alone most of the time and it just really means a lot to me that people I don't even know are willing to listen to me and help me. I guess I just got so used to never being able to express myself (as I don't have friends I can open up to and my partner just gets angry when I try to talk about anything emotional), so I assumed that help was completely unavailable. Knowing that there are people I can talk to (even if it's just on reddit) has given me the courage to make an appointment with a counsellor, to try to sort out my anxiety issues and the possibilities for moving forward. I honestly don't know how I went from being an independent young woman to this, but I am not happy. I just hope that I can find myself again through the mess that this relationship has turned me into.",10,2012-07-23 00:30:59 EDT-0400

(I have had GAD diagnosed for 7 years, so I know a lot about myself/symptoms). I'm very capable of feeling ok during the day (ignoring, allowing thoughts/fears to pass through me), but when it comes to eating/swallowing my body stops at the last second. It's worst in public, but even happens in private when I take my time. I recently lost 5 lbs last week. I can barely eat liquids. I have been on a mostly ensure diet for the past week or so. I am about to go to the food store to pick up food that is a mix of liquid, and some semi-solid food. I have tried pushing through the thoughts, but the more I try, the harder (more panicky/panic attacks) it is. It's really frustrating because I am actually functioning fine otherwise, but my work days are long (6 - 6 or 7 pm), and I need to be able to eat at work, which I've been avoiding. But this can't keep up forever. I can barely eat at my apartment alone very slowly, so I'm kind of lost. Any help or guidance is greatly appreciated. ESPECIALLY, if anyone could give me a list of good foods for me in this situation for the short-term because I know I need to push through the fears, but I really need to gain weight in the short term, because everyday i feel like i'm going to pass out.

524,21 and can't make/hate the idea of making friends,"Let me just first say that I have NO friends. Zero. I also just had my first child, so I feel I am even more isolated, and that maybe people wouldn't be interested in me enough to begin a friendship with me. 
I have a bunch of anxiety problems, and I'm also depressed as shit. 

Anyway,
I recently went to an event in my city and was reminded of why I hate even just thinking about making friends. 
When I went I was eager and hopeful that I'd be ""confident"" and start talking to anyone who looked interesting/was near me.

Once I got there, I noticed it was full of people who seemed to be part of tightly knit groups already. The group was 17-23 years old (I pretty much know where all of these people are from/know most of their names at least) and in the age range that I'd like to make friends in. I talked to 2 people I already knew and remained quiet for the rest of the night.

I'm just baffled...as I was looking around, I didn't like anyone. I couldn't help listening and observing some of them and thinking ""what a fucking tool, why god"" and not wanting to be friends with them.
I realize this is WRONG. I snapped myself out of it. Yet I was/am still confused over how exactly to approach people I want to talk to or become friends with when they are standing in a circle of people they are already great friends with and talking excitedly about things they have all done together.
Also, when I do happen to talk to someone new, I feel like I'm the one pushing to be friends. I feel like they have enough friends and couldnt give a shit if they talk to me or not. I feel like I seem pathetic trying to clamor for friends and that they can tell and pass judgement on me over this.

I've tried talking to people online as well. It's always the same. I'm asking all of the questions, initiating every conversation, and if I stop talking in a conversation, they won't start it back up again. 

Young people seem so egotistical and like they are only into themselves and the people they've known already from school who are similar to them. I feel like I've outgrown this mentality and want to make friends with all types of different people. The events I am interested in in my area and that I have access to (art and music shows) mostly have this same group of 50-60 people (probably more, i cant count) in attendance. (young ""artists"" and musicians)....

what am i doing wrong? i don't want to try incredibly hard just to get people to talk to me or be interested in me. i guess i am just really that boring?? does anyone else have a similar problem?

Also haircuts, just because of those ten minutes of small talk. When she's like, ""sooo, whatcha doing this weekend?"" I want to say, ""playing video games, drinking, and masturbating, in that order. You?""

530,Yes.,"I just realized this Reddit exists. Thank God. I'm hoping to get some advice or someone can relate to me. 

One of my major anxieties is being a passenger in a vehicle. There have been a lot of close calls while other people have been driving. Especially on grid roads. When I'm a passenger I start crying and hyperventilating. It's come to the point where I don't even want to THINK about someone else driving. The only traumatic event I can think of that could have triggered this is that one of my close friends was killed in a car accident. Anyone else have anxieties about vehicles in general?

Also. My family. I'm 21 years old and live on my own. I call my parents and sister EVERYDAY. If I can't get a hold of them right away I begin to freak out and automatically think that something horrid has happened.. Anyone else?

531,Constantly in fear over things that haven't happened...yet.,"This has been going on for years. My biggest fear is of my family dying. Mainly by car accident. It's getting a bit better but I used to fear this DAILY. The scenario would play through my head down to how I would react, and the reaction was real. I would actually start crying and hyperventilating as it it was actually happening. A sickening though popped in my head a little while ago that stressing myself out is almost a high and I do this to myself on purpose. That scares me. It really does. 

Now that I own a home I fear of coming home to someone in the house, the house burning down, or someone breaking in while I'm inside. This is on top of the fears I'm having about my family. 

I call them as much as possible to tell them I love them and to drive carefully, thinking it might be my last time speaking to them. Yes, every time I speak with my family I do it like it's the last time I will ever talk to them.

I'm at loss. Even typing about this brings up those feelings. I know this isn't normal. Is there anything I can do aside from seeking professional help or taking medication?",22,2012-02-19 18:10:42 EST-0500
532,I think I've hit bottom.,"I can't remember the last time I've felt this bad. On Thursday I had a horrible panic attack at work and had to leave 15 minutes after I got there. I told my boss for the first time what was going on, and she was really understanding and nice about it but I feel so embarrassed I just never want to go back. I've spent most of this weekend holed up in my cave of a bedroom feeling sick and nauseous almost constantly. I don't think I can take this anymore. There are so many things that I wanted to do with my life, but this constant feeling of physical and mental unwellness sits like a boulder on my chest and keeps me from doing the smallest things. I'm to the point where I have to psych myself up just to go downstairs into my own kitchen. My emotions are completely and totally out of sync with the rational part of my mind, and I can feel it chipping away at me always, even on the ""good days"". The thought of dying scares the hell out of me, but I'm starting to think that suicide would be worth it just to end these horrible feelings.",14,2012-02-20 00:08:09 EST-0500
533,Is it heard of to have panic attacks when people nearby are arguing or yelling?,"When I'm in the same room with people who become hostile or one begins to yell at the other my brain begins to shut down, I feel my chest getting tight, and it is harder to breath. If I don't get away I feel as if my body is getting weak and I could collapse. I'm not sure if this comes from the constant fighting my parents did in front of me growing up(mostly over little things, in public, which would often end up in one of them later projecting it onto me). I know, not exactly much or anything, but it is the only thing I can think of.

I was put on paxil and that worked for a little while but eventually I felt like I just wasn't myself anymore. So once winter break came I decided to ween myself off of it, and I'm happy to say that I got off of it successfully.

I usually stay away from ""wild"" parties, but sometimes even if I'm at a get-together with a bunch of people I'm friends with, I'll have a good time for a while and then just hit a wall at which point I feel *very* tired and just want to go home and relax. I have GAD, but I don't really feel any of the usual feelings of anxiety (heart racing, difficulty breathing, shaking, etc) during these situations.

541,Anxiety and how it effects my experiences with Marijuana and Alcohol (separately),"Do any of you (like myself) smoke Marijuana? or drink alcohol? I know that the risk of psychological addiction is almost soley present in people with anxiety and depressive disorders. I've dealt with that in my time, and is a whole other cat in a bag that isn't a big problem for me. But what is a big problem is that I find myself enjoying Marijuana way less than my friends, and Alcohol more than my friends. I kind of think both are related to my Anxiety. 

When I smoke pot, I sometimes experience what I've read is a symptom of panic attack called ""Hyperarousal"" where you feel physically on edge, or ultra paranoid about your sensory experience. My friends who don't have anxiety as bad as myself, or (some of them) at all remind me that I should let the effects calm me, etc... And sometimes I do get calmed (mostly if I'm alone, not if I'm with others.). The Hyperarousal seems to happen soley with Sativa's and never with Indica strains, I should mention. I always find Indicas to be highly congnitive and almost cleansing. 

Alcohol however, I enjoy way more than my friends it seems. I often feel like it's a race to forget my own mind, and that everyone else should be so burdened by their ownselves as I am that they should do likewise. My anxiety however MELTS away after one or two beers. I can talk to girls, I can sing or dance. It's amazing the difference. But I sometimes end up trying to keep up with my friends and make a fool of myself. (even if I don't make a fool out of myself, being sober and hungover with anxiety... I am embarrassed to death to hear stories of an unhindered me... doing all sorts of fun.) So I absolutely hate hangovers... but only from a psychological stand point. 

Does anyone relate?

Also to answer any questions about why it's only separate. If I combine them I have a lot of trouble remembering the next day regardless the amount of either.",33,2012-02-21 13:00:07 EST-0500

My reply

Dear student x,

Please do not be concerned. Firstly let's deal with this in our own 
time so you will not be requested to present on Monday.Secondly I do 
recognise that all of you together make for a really challenging 
audience. That is why I have taken the opportunity of the timetable 
clashes to split you all up. There will only be around 30 present on 
Monday.I had hoped that was obvious but may be I need to get an email 
out as several of your colleagues will also be worried ,may be not to 
the same extent.

It is very far sighted of you to offer to present by yourself. Let's 
find an opportunity to try this out but only if you really wish.

The most important issue however is your well being. I am ever so 
grateful you have written. If you wish I'd be happy to meet to check 
there are no other issues we need to be resolving.

I am ever so sorry to hear the news of your father . I do hope you 
and your family are coping at such a difficult time

543,Does anyone know how to cope?,I suffer from anxiety (generalized but I show many traits for almost every anxiety disorder out there) & depression (situational).

I cannot stop picking my face. When I notice myself doing it, I stop, but I do it unconsciously, constantly, I think in my sleep or at least when I'm half awake. I wake up and realize that I've been drowsily pawing at my face, unawake and unaware. I run my hands over my face, and wherever there is a bump I scratch it off, until if feels smooth.

I'm not sure why I do this, but I've been doing it for years. I get mild acne, or I used to, I don't know what is going on with my skin anymore. I look like a meth-head, you know, the ones with sores all over their faces. I have to layer on foundation so that I can leave my room, let alone go outside.

Please please help me, I don't know what to do about this but it just keeps getting worse. It's horrible and I hate it and I just don't know how to stop.

Also, I was hoping that there was someone else out there who does something like this. Please speak up if you're out there, I feel like a total freak.

545,"My fellow medicated redditors, what is your stance on daily medication for anxiety?","This is my dilemma:

I'm also in therapy, which has really helped me cope. I feel like I might as well just not be on medication at all, it's a waste of my money and I'm not so certain it isn't making me feel a little bit worse. The main thing stopping me from asking my doctor about going off is my fear of depression. I know it's common for people with panic disorders to suffer from depression/hopelessness because of the severity of the disorder.

I feel like my anxiety and my compulsions have gotten worse as I've gotten older. 33 now, and I really don't ever remember feeling this anxious in my whole life. I feel like I am making myself anxious. Like the more I think about it and the more I research and try to understand it, the worse it gets. Is anyone else dealing with that? Any coping techniques you've found as you age?

Also I get very strange urges or compulsions to jump. Jump out of a moving car, jump from the the nosebleeds in an arena, jump of ledges, balconies etc.. I am not suicidal, I dont want to die. And I am actually scared I will do it, like I will not be able to stop myself. Like there is some subconscious barrier that tells you not to jump, it isn't safe, you could hurt yourself, but that barrier will just disappear. I don't know what this feeling is called, so I am having a tough time researching it. Any redditors who have a similar compulsion, or have a good grasp of what it is, I would love to hear, thanks.

547,Overcoming social anxiety induced by the fear of god and cut-throat social hierarchies,"Hi, Reddit.

I am a 19 year old male in my second semester of college. I've had the notion of being a pushover and a fraud for quite some time, and I think I just didn't want to face it. I have been willing for far too long to trade my own comfort and peace of mind for others' whims and my constant, brooding social anxiety. I think I can accurately trace the origin of this social anxiety to my elementary school, which I attended for 9 years. It was a private, Christian school in the Louisiana South. In this school, the fear (more like terror) of God was instilled in all the children, and a cut-throat social hierarchy arose, with each person using and abusing his or her social power in whatever horribly corrupt way seemed convenient. One example of the many is an occurrence during art class one day, involving a somewhat annoying boy and a popular girl. The girl got angry at the boy (for some minor offense, the details of which escape me) and, after knocking him to the floor, proceeded to stomp and jump on him in full view of the entire class and even teachers who passed by the door, saw what was happening, and continued on their merry way. In the end, the boy was punished for a week, and the girl for a day. This was the social climate in a class of ~20-30 students for the 9 years I spent there. 


How this ties in with me, at least in the most major way that hit me like a ton of bricks today is this:

First, in the conservative U.S. South, sex is an especially taboo subject - above all at a private Christian school of ~180 people who know each other very well. With the social hierarchy (and my level of social anxiety), this obviously creates a terrible environment for sexual discourse and acceptance. The slightest inkling of dislike, especially from one of the socially more favored, would illicit immediate tattling, upon hearing any talk of any remotely controversial subject, and a nice chat with the principal or teacher would soon follow, wherein the student would be given again the fear of eternal damnation for mere thought or word crime.

Second, I have, and always have had, an enormous libido... so, this type of conversation was always interesting to me (as I assume it is to most other children of that age). The thing is, I paid very literal attention to what the teachers were telling me, and took the threat of eternal damnation (from a god who they, in perpetual fits of unnoticed dissonance, asserted loved us all, ftw) very seriously. So seriously in fact that I was in effect emasculated by these vicious, ""innocent"" whistle-blowers, voluntarily avoiding conversation on a subject that otherwise would have been wildly fulfilling and great at that naive age. This was after a few other naive homosexual encounters with my friends between the ages of ~6 and ~8 - actions which had been themselves preached as horrible abominations and grounds for condemnation at this particular hell-hole of a school.

My father had a very open mind, though, and always tried to instill in me curiosity and inquisition, whatever the subject matter. But he didn't have the scriptural authority of these *qualified* teachers, so on matters involving the divine creator's wrath, I *reasonably* deferred to them, and stopped all inquisition, or guiltily pursued such subject matter in deep secret.

So, from 1st to 8th grade, I was taught something along the lines of my sexuality being thoroughly evil at this age, and only acceptable after a religious and god-sanctioned marriage. In 8th grade, I started to become indignant at the teachers' naive dismissal of the theory of evolution by scripture and faith, even while knowingly dissonant of the Catholic Church's position on the matter. No, of course they could interpret ancient literature from a southern U.S. worldview better than the pope.

In 9th grade, I went to a secular, public, magnet high school and was surrounded by much more rational thinkers of more colors than just white. From 9th grade to 12th grade, I lost my ridiculous faith and became vehemently atheist, and the rational side of my mind evolved past the lies told me at my previous school. I had a fairly intense sex life during sophomore and junior year - the polar opposite of what I was taught in elementary school, and likely caused by rebellion against my former oppression. In my personal life, I started giving up former beliefs taught to me by the same kind of otherwise good and well-intentioned people who had instilled such terror in me before, especially thanks to one amazing friend who has probably changed me more than I can knowingly give him credit for. Ironically, it was when I started smoking marijuana and realized the extent to which the propaganda thereof was insanely exaggerated that I *started* to really challenge everything I had been taught. My grades went up, I closed in on my more passionate interests, and starting working hard on a few projects. After this, a wonderful backpacking trip through Europe, a good first semester in college, and starting a new relationship, I thought my progression away from these Christian views was going fairly well, admittedly with faults here and there, sometimes continuous and lingering faults.

Today made me put some things in perspective. I was about to have sex with my girlfriend, and things were going fairly well in regards to foreplay. However, I could not for the life of me get an erection. This made the situation fairly awkward, and we ended up stopping (she said she was a bit sore - don't know how true that is). All I could feel was the same type of shame I felt all throughout elementary school while trying to embrace my sexuality, which is ridiculous because she is a very understanding person, and all it would take to get past something like this is an erectile dysfunction joke and being a bit less tired the next time. I then started thinking about why I felt so ashamed. We have been together for a little longer than 3 months, and the sex at the beginning was intense and great, and then she got house-locked by her overbearing parents for about 2 months. That time was probably the most sexually frustrated I have ever been. I've found that even though I had mostly gotten past these archaic, fear-mongering tendencies taught to me in elementary school, it's still a huge problem for me to adequately express myself sexually to people that expression would make me vulnerable to, without extreme shame and the feeling of guilt-tripping them into sex. I rationally know that this is excessive and paranoid, but it is so insanely hard to believe and act on that knowledge. So she really had no insight into the extent of my sexual frustration, or my feelings of shame and regret at placing so much importance on a single sexual encounter that I actually couldn't even feel aroused.

This social anxiety isn't so bad with strangers, though there is definitely a notion of it still there. It's the worst with people I am in the process of becoming intimate with. Although, there are still some instances where, for whatever reason, I have refrained from revealing to Christians who I knew before my atheism that I am now an atheist. I am sure the main reason for this is my desire for continued good relations with these people, but there is definitely an aspect of fear/relief at not having to tell them.

Today was eye-opening, and finally brought at least some of my problems to my own forefront. My goal, more than anything now, is to truly get past my social anxiety and be able to express myself without fear or reserve. Otherwise, I feel that any potential accomplishments will always be marred by a disgusting, bigot-induced, and voluntarily-continued impracticality of living.

553,i would really appreciate some help right now. i've been losing it.,"oooooooooookay.

this will be a long one, but i'll try to be succinct.

i am 18 years old, female, and i have been experiencing panic attacks 5/7 days a week for the past month and a half. i had my first panic attack when i was about 12 and have had short bursts of panic since then.

i have diagnosed depression and anxiety, and could also possibly be bipolar II because i have had hypomanic episodes before and have a very very strong family history in its favour.

i am a strong and resillient person and i have pushed my way through this as best i could but some days i really collapse and can't handle it. i'm trying to finish up my first year of university here, and am working part time and i'm bending under all the weight of this. there have been many times where i've been on the edge and i've been thinking suicide is a good option, but i love my friends and family too much. i want to get better.

some triggers for my attacks are being in a place i can't leave, thinking about throwing up, performance (had an attack on stage last night), and meta-anxiety: worrying about my anxiety long term.

i think i might have low self esteem because i had a very very awful childhood, i was neglected and left alone all the time. i know that self esteem ties intimately in to anxiety issues.

i've been to my doctor about this but the only thing she has to offer me is a medication that i have a long history with. i was on 100mg of seroquel for two whole years in high school after going into the hospital for depression. i don't know why they gave me seroquel for depression, but it helped with the sleeping issues and it agreed with me pretty well. i guess it turned me into a complacent zombie who kept filling the prescriptions they gave me. last june, however, i successfully got off it and didn't take it again until january.

in january i went to my doctor to describe a hypomanic episode during which i stayed up really late and got a lot accomplished. apparently that calls to be medicated and i was okay with it because i like it for sleeping. i soon got off it for the same reasons as before.

i don't want to be on seroquel at all because it has the possible side effect of tardive dyskinesia. if you're not familiar with this, it's uncontrollable facial twitching/grimacing. i would kill myself if i came down with this. the chances increase with the time you're taking it for. i don't want to risk that!

anyways, she convinced me to take it again when i went in about 3 weeks ago for this problem. i was really reluctant but she kept saying just trust me, take the seroquel. so whatever, i did. i felt a bit better once it got into my system, i guess stable is the word. the panic attacks subsided a bit but still stayed around. then i had a panic attack where my eye wouldn't stop twitching so i started thinking it could be a sign of tardive dyskinesia and got off the seroquel.

it's been four days and i feel shitty but i'm not being given any other options. i feel very alone. i'd like to get a new doctor but that can't be done immediately.

i guess what i'm asking for is some support: anyone been through anything similar? what should i do? what are some non-prescription options to help myself? (diet, exercise, CBT exercises, whatever techniques you like)

to whoever read through my story, and to whoever replies, thanks very much.

559,"Going to see a psychiatrist tomorrow for adderall, considering talking about anxiety problems instead.","Over the past couple years i've come to suspect that what I thought was a mild life long depression, really could be Generalized anxiety disorder. I find myself often overcome with negative thoughts about my relationship, my future, my apparence, and my interaction with other people.

When I was in forth grade I was diagnosed and treated for OCD, after I became obsessed with the fear of my mom dying. I couldn't leave her site for almost a year, just barley got away with passing 4th grade because of it. Soon After I was treated, the OCD symptoms completely went away. My biggest fear is that someday Ill be triggered by something that will cause an extreme obsessive  thought like that to manifest again. 

After my symptoms went away, my family never mentioned it again. It was something that I hardly thought about. In high school I did a lot of worrying and stressing about my life, but it didn't really become something that drastically effected me till about my sophomore year of college. 

When I was about 20 I completely became withdrawn and depressed. I pretty much stopped leaving my apartment, and ended up being put on academic suspension for a semester because of my grades. After that I started to see a psychiatrist who put me on adderall. 

Adderall ended up really helping me for a while. In my semester off from college I worked a lot and saved money, and when I came back to school, things really turned around for me. Even though mentally I didn't feel perfect, I was able to accomplish a lot, and I was generally happier then before. After about a year on it, I decided to stop going to my psychiatrist because of money and somewhat because of my parents worry about me becoming dependent on it. 
Ever since I've always wondered if things would be better for me if I were back on it. Sometimes I buy a few here and there from friends, and I feel really great for a week.

 I'm at a very challenging time for me right now. I'm about to graduate from college, and I am in the process of applying to grad schools, getting my portfolio together (i'm a designer/copywriter), and applying for internships. I don't feel like Ive been emotionally stable enough to accomplish any of this right now, and they've been piling up and weighing on me more then anything ever has. 
I could go to the psychiatrist tomorrow and get adderall. I know it has worked for me in the past, but i'm convinced that my real problems are anxiety. Or I could try to be treated for my anxiety, and risk wasting precious time that I don't have right now figuring out what medications work for me, etc. 

Reddit, what should I do? I'm leaning toward going back on adderall till the end of the semester and bring up my anxiety problems in the summer, when Ill have time to experiment. 

I'd really appreciate peoples opinions, just found this subreddit, but it seems like a really great resource. ",15,2012-04-06 13:59:29 EDT-0400
560,I feel like I'm wasting everyone's time,"I started having panic attacks a couple months ago. I've had 3 appointments with 2 different whatever they're called (therapists?). 2 of those were just them trying to find out what's going on, and they went fine I guess. Recently, though, I had a followup appointment and I don't think I was very helpful at all. I have a 2nd appointment with the other one coming up, so I was wondering if I could get some advice on how to be more prepared to answer their questions, I guess, but I don't know how realistic that is.

Anyway, I answered pretty much every question with ""I don't know"" or ""I (don't) think so."" Most notably, probably, he asked if I had any questions or anything I wanted to say and I couldn't think of anything. Also, I dropped my classes this semester because I had avoided going too many times and he asked if there was anything he could do to help me get back to school. I couldn't think of anything for that either. It seems the only thing I can do about that is wait until the end of the semester, enroll in some classes, and try to go.

In the meantime, they have this weekly group thing I've been going to. I don't really like it, but it doesn't seem like I have an alternative. It does make me feel better to go, I think, but it is mostly just talking about what you did the past week and what skills you exercised and I don't ever have anything to say. Whenever it gets to my turn it's:
""I drove [something I was/am avoiding] some more""
""Where did you go?""
""To the store""
""Did you feel anxious?""
""Yes.""
""But you did it anyway?""
""Yes.""
""That's good.""
And I feel silly not having anything more to say. Especially when there is someone in a similar position to me who is anxious about driving, but didn't drop their classes and has to drive much farther than I did to get to them.

The person my upcoming appointment is with had me record my thoughts, particularly, I think, when I dwell on mistakes. Immediately after the appointment I thought of answers I gave to some questions that I knew I could give better and I wrote them down. So I have some things to say if I can get myself to bring them up, but it's hard to answer new questions and I end up wasting the opportunity I waited a month for. She asked me what I wanted out of this and I said I didn't know. I still don't really know. I say that a lot.",5,2012-04-01 07:48:17 EDT-0400
561,I just started Cymbalta today for general anxiety disorder.  I will let you know how it works out.,"A little about me.  I’ve just recently realized that I have general anxiety disorder for much of my life.  Overall I appear confident and successful, but behind the scenes I deal with anxiety daily.  I’ve always thought I was a procrastinator and that I was weak, now I realize it was avoidance.  The better I would feel, the less I would want to do things that would cause anxiety.  This is a constant thorn in my side and causes me to be extremely critical of myself.

I have my own company and the anxiety and avoidance is causing me to delay or avoid things that can seriously hurt my business.  I finally bit the bullet and started Cymbalta today (20mg).  This is my first time on any sort of anxiety medication.  I will be happy to report my progress, or lack thereof, if anyone is interested.

Edit: 4 Days In Now.  The first day I had a slight ringing in my ears and occassionaly I have what feels like slight pressure on the sides of my head.  Overall I do feel calmer, although it might be a placebo effect this early.  Also, I spoke with my Dr. about withdrawl issues many people have.  The Dr let me know that as long as you taper off, the symptoms are manageable and that in their own experience, none of their patients had a 'terrible' episode weaning off the drug.  They did point out that some people will react differently to the drug and a minority will have the horrible symptoms.",18,2012-04-03 03:54:14 EDT-0400

563,"My mother died in 2010, now I'm a different person.","In 2010, my mother died from leukemia. We had just celebrated her 5 year anniversary free of breast cancer. The chemotherapy she received from that had given her a small chance to get leukemia, and it did. She had been sick for a few weeks, with random symptoms it seemed like. After she died, it was uncovered she hadn't been sharing all her symptoms with doctors and was in fact hiding the serious pain and issues she was feeling. 

I went to work one day and my dad called me to tell me my mother was in the emergency room, she collapsed from weakness. In the ER they diagnosed the leukemia from a simple blood test. At the time, my wife was 5 months pregnant. My mother asked me if she would live to see her grandson...one of the worst moments of my life. I told her she had already seen him on the ultrasound, and that was all that mattered.

The next day I came back to the hospital and she couldn't speak, but was conscious. I instantly regretted leaving at all, despite her begging me not to stay the night prior. She insisted I didn't need to be there. I told her what I needed to, and I hope she heard. She died later that afternoon.

A few months after my mother died, my best friend was hospitalized with Crohn's disease and had his entire colon removed. He nearly died from several surgeries and I was fearful I would lose him also.

Around the same time, I had some stomach problems and a weird prostate problem for my age (I'm 27 now, 25 at the time) and got what I would call a panic attack, the first real one in my life. I went to the ER, and they hospitalized me because I had strange kidney levels. It turned out it was all due to taking ibuprofen for my prostate and temporarily inhibited my kidneys, and I was released in a few days.

After that, I had an extreme mental breakdown. The day I was released I was convinced they missed something wrong with me. I felt extreme fatigue, and was told it was from anixety. I insisted I had leukemia or something they missed. I went to my family doctor and he gave me an SSRI and Xanax, said I needed them and nothing was wrong with me medically.

I refused to take the pills for fear of what they would do to me. Over the next several months I struggled with severe hypochondria. I worried about nearly every disease, and none of them panned out. I saw several doctors for fear they weren't doing the right thing, and saw many specialists. The only diagnosis I have received is Gastritis and Anxiety/Depression. Throughout all this I was prone to frequent crying fits about my mother or worrying about other items in my life. 

 

After my son was born and the stress subsided, for the first 8 months or so of 2011 was mostly normal. Ever since though, I have had recurring hypochondria, with various degrees of intensity. It is stressing my wife out and I can't blame her. I saw a normal counselor (not psychiatrist) for 8 weeks during the worst of it. It helped some but I'm still not normal. Even in times when I'm not seriously worried about a medical problem, my mind drifts to death and worrying about how I will die and what comes after.

My question is: is this common? Has anyone else had a similar experience? Before all of this, I had no history of depression or serious anxiety (some claustrophobia). How do other people cope? What should I do? How do I fix my life? I've thought about taking the SSRI but worried my sexual life will never be the same again after googling horror stories about them. I just need help, I'm not sure where else to turn.

565,Counsellor wants me to stop self medicating...,"me - female 29

I've been seeing a counsellor for 6 months, i'm in the process of being referred to more long term couselling. 

This isn't the first time this has come up but this counsellor wants me to stop smoking pot and drinking. Without pot I have really bad panic attacks. She thinks it would be easier to diagnose and medicate if I wasn't self medicating.

I'm unsure what to do, I'm know the pot exasperates some of the issues but i also don't want to have panic attacks. It's not that she's anti-drugs, just thinks it would be good for me to quit.

And you can bet that almost the entire time, even before the gas starts happening!, I'm worrying about my stomach and how I can possibly manage my gas this time and how many excuses I'll have to come up with to leave the room before people get suspicious. This fear has caused me to become terrified of normal social events because I don't want to be ""that"" gross, weird person who constantly is gassy. 

I've had times where I've tried to sit through social situations and just ""deal"" with it which have often miserably failed. I had to walk out of two movies now with no good-sounding excuse to give those I was with. And I've had to leave in the middle of board games due to my stomach going wild.

I've been suffering from a pretty extreme anxiety disorder for the last four years, and for the last month I have been doing alright and it feels great. 

I have a summer job, just part time, but I'm waking up each morning, getting washed and dressed, eating breakfast, and leaving the house each day. They seem like such small accomplishments, but it's a huge improvement for me. 

In the past I would go a week without leaving my house and then only be forced out when I ran out of food. I would spend all my time online just to pass the day and escape. But I have been able to go a whole week with no non-essential internet. 

I know I will have more stress when school starts up again, but I'm building up my confidence. I'm showing myself that I can live a normal life, I don't have to feel anxious all the time.

I just wanted to share that with people who would understand. :)

581,"[Rant] Do any of you, like myself, desperately crave direction?","Hi everyone, although I have a lot I'd like to say, I'll try to keep this as short as possible.

I grew up (probably like most of you) as a shy, introverted, and somewhat-awkward child. I got good grades, was in gifted programs, won awards for science fairs and various projects, never once got in trouble with anyone and was constantly told how I would go places. I always had strange phobias and fears, and after years of having weird stomach aches, racing thoughts, and et cetera, when I was in my Junior year of high school I was diagnosed with having General Anxiety Disorder and Panic Disorder.

A few medications kept me going through school, until midway through my senior year I thought to myself 'I can't do this anymore'. School was complete nonsense for me at that point. My grades had slipped so bad that I lost all hope of a scholarship, and might have even failed the 12th grade. So I made the decision to sign myself out of the school system, and instead I got my GED through the local college in a month's time.
During the next year I really didn't do anything except tell myself that I would apply to college as soon as I could. The local community college, as something to start off with and prep myself for an actual University. Semester after semester passed, and I kept telling myself that I'll apply next semester, or next summer, or winter, or next year. In the midst of all this I worked at a chain grocery store as a cashier, trying to save up as much money as I possibly could but not really going anywhere with it. The little that I did save up would either have to be put toward an unexpected bill, or our hours would get cut at work so it would dip back down. I pretty much had an average balance of 200 or so dollars at a time in my account.

Around two or so years ago I had a massive string of panic attacks each time I would go into work. I called out sick a few days (which our new manager was furious about, despite previous knowledge of my condition). One day I had to leave early because my heart rate was going crazy and I felt like I just needed to leave ASAP. My manager told me if I left he didn't want me back as an employee, so I told him that's fine and walked out the door. That was the only 'real' job that I have ever had.

So, here I am now. I'm almost 22, and currently am 'working' as a self-employed freelance web designer and computer repairman. I got into web design after I left the grocery store because I thought there was money in it, and it was something that I could learn about/do in the safety of my own home. Now I've come to realize that this is something that I'm really miserable doing, and that doesn't even get me that much money in the first place. I'm currently averaging around 400/month, and am constantly searching reddit and various other sites to find work. My anxiety is a bit better, panic attacks are few and far between, and I'm not on any steady medication (I do have a prescription of xanax that's for as-needed use only). However, I just feel so absolutely stuck and useless.

I have tons of useful (I think) talents, and a passion to learn, but I have nothing to use these towards. I can program in a variety of languages, I can build front and back ends of websites, I've developed several site projects on my own time. Even though the one that I'm currently working on I feel will fail just like all the others I've tried and be a waste of time as well. I had dreams of becoming a scientist, or an engineer, or a physicist, but with no money, and no education I really don't see that becoming a reality anytime soon. I used to have a good amount of friends that I would constantly hang out with, and no I rarely see anyone at all. The last two close friends that I started doing a large amount of drugs constantly, and wouldn't want to hang out unless I tried it with them, and I don't want to so I never see them.

I used to be so good at work, and at school. When someone told me what they needed to get done and when, I was your man. I could learn anything necessary, and would pour effort into it. Now that I'm 'grown up' and have literally thousands of options of what to do next, I'm completely paralyzed. I take steps down one road or the other, trying to find out which option would be best for me, which would help me reach the goals that I want to reach the quickest and easiest. I just want to be happy, to be comfortable. I don't want to have to worry about not having any money to do anything anymore, I want to have a stable job, I want to travel, to live, and to experience things. I want to control my anxiety and get rid of my constant negative thoughts that whatever I'm doing at the present time is not good enough, and will just end up being a waste of time that could be spent doing something better. I have tried, started, and stopped so many hobbies, projects, sites, 'businesses', etc, it's ridiculous. Most people keep telling me that I need to apply for a job instead of trying to do something on my own, but I'm terrified that if I start another job I'll just have to quit from anxiety, like school and the jobs before. I have been thinking of volunteering though.

tl;dr I just want direction. From friends, family, I'm tired of being cast adrift on my own merits. I just wish for some sort of guidance, for someone to tell me 'You need to do this, this, and this if you want to get started on becoming a scientist.' Sitting in front of my computer day in and day out has helped me relax and helped me to forget about the problems I normally have to face, but I would rather start being successful and contributing something to mankind.

I rarely talked to him in those 4 years. He moved back a few years ago and is trying to mend broken bridges and the like, but it still gets me... but what I think this is directly from is in March of this year I lost my great-grandmother. I was very close to her as she was my babysitter when I was younger, and she was an amazing woman. We saw her death coming from a mile away, but it did sting when she finally passed... that one, as devastating as it was, pales in comparison to the second death I experienced in March... about 2 weeks after my great-grandmother passed, my best friend died unexpectedly due to heart complications. We don't know exactly what yet, because the autopsy results have still not been delivered. But that one really hit me hard. I'm an only child so with no siblings he was the closest thing to a brother that I had. I have a girlfriend; she is nothing but absolutely amazing and has stood by my side through all of this. But lately I've been noticing I'm extremely paranoid about losing her... I don't know why. She hasn't done anything to make me feel this way, and she is more than faithful to me. It eats me alive day in and day out. After losing him, she is the only person I really associate with or talk to or really even spend time with.

599,Has anyone here gotten better?  I'd love to hear from you.,"I have always had a really anxious temperament and have been seeing therapists and psychiatrists on and off for over a decade.  Lately, things in my life are going pretty well, but my husband and I have a bit of economic/career uncertainty and I am having a really hard time coping with overwhelming anxiety.

I am currently seeing a therapist (cognitive behavioral therapist) and am going to see a new psychiatrist in early July.  I'm not on any medication except for the occasional xanax to manage my most acute symptoms, but I try to go sparingly with those.  I've been on a bunch of antidepressants (Prozac, Wellbutrin, some others I can't remember) but nothing specifically for the anxiety other than xanax or valium.

I have tried progressive relaxation, breathing techniques, CBT, guided meditation... some seem to offer some temporary relief but either I'm not good enough at keeping up with it or it's just not enough.

My anxiety feels like a cloud just hovering over me about nothing specific, or it can manifest itself about any topic: my pets, my house, my career, etc, which I usually feed by relentless internet researching. My husband says if I ever get pregnant, he is going to take away the computer for nine months and beyond, because I just make myself that crazy.

All of this is to say that one of my biggest fears FEEDING my anxiety is worry that I will never feel normal.  I need some hope that I can get better, even if it's just a bit better.

I'll be working to the day I can't work and that day who knows what will happen to me because I won't be able to afford medical care.

602,Anxiety preventing me from getting help for my anxiety,"One of my worst anxiety triggers is talking to people I don't know on the phone. I get panicky when my phone rings and a number I don't recognize pops up, and making calls myself is even worse. I have to write out exactly what I'm going to say beforehand, and even then it sometimes puts me in tears and usually means I'm just not up for dealing with people at all for the rest of the day.

Needless to say, this puts me in a pretty shitty position for getting any sort of treatment, since finding a doctor involves lots of phone calls. Added to this is the fun of having never received my new insurance card when my company switched carriers last year (I know I'm covered, because it shows up on my paycheck), so I need to call *them*, too, and the fact that my parents won't give me my medical records and keep telling me to ""just call"" the psychiatrist I saw when I was in college and ask for my file and don't seem to understand that there is no such thing as ""just"" calling someone for me.

But my anxiety is getting worse, and it's gotten to the point where it's prevented me from doing important things like going to the dentist and getting medical care for semi-serious injuries, and a few times in the last couple of months, I've been close to not being able to convince myself to leave the house for work. So, I know I need help, but I have no idea how to get it. Any suggestions would be really appreciated.",15,2012-02-01 03:02:21 EST-0500
603,5 Breaths Technique,"I do this when I have anxiety building inside of me, and it works. Something about focusing on the breath and the feeling of belly breathing in and out just totally overwhelms my anxiety with calm, and I feel much better.

The way to do this:

1. When you have a feeling of anxiety coming on, pause and notice it. Tell yourself ""I feel anxiety/panic/etc. coming on.""

2. Take a moment and put your awareness, focus your attention, on your belly.

3. Begin to draw in a breath into the belly. Keep your attention on the sensation of the breath going in. The depth of the breath is not as important as focusing on the sensation of breathing. It is better to breathe slowly rather than quickly, however this can take time if you are feeling serious panic building. It might take you a few breaths to work up to slow breathing, but give it a chance. 

4. Exhale slowly. If you can, extend the exhale, and then pause (briefly) at the end of the breath.

5. Repeat (at least) 4 times more. The trick is to keep your awareness on the sensation of breathing, on the feeling of your belly moving in and out. You will notice when you are panic breathing that your breathing takes place in your chest, not your belly. There is a physiological response with shallow breathing that increases the likelihood of an anxiety attack. Use some more breaths if 5 isn't enough. Five is somewhat of a magic number, though, and it works pretty much every time for me.

I swear takes me to a different state of mind every time. Just one more tool in your toolbox. Good luck out there!

Not sure why I'm posting this, but none of my friends seems to understand why I'm not psyched for what could prove to be the best party of my life.

612,Anxiety is taking over my life. I'm a total mess. ,"A very bad anxiety month has culminated in me having several anxiety attacks at work. I've been demoted as a result and several of my co-workers are spreading a rumor that I've been faking my attacks to get out of work/bad tables/whatever. I work as a server, for a bombastic man who's an expert in Finding Fault. In my ""ok"" states, I can brush this off, but the last month has been a blur of anxious thoughts and he's triggering me. It's hard because otherwise I love my job. Now, I'm just sick all the time. I can't think of a single scenario regarding my job that doesn't end with me living in a box and never seeing my children again. 

It's 8:05 in the morning, and despite the fact that I work nights, I'm up. I'm up because I barely slept last night, I was shaking so bad and kept having to get up to throw up. I don't sleep in general. I shake all the time. I'm irritable, and so not myself that I'm just terrified. I feel sorry for my fiance, for my children. I feel sorry for anyone who's stuck with me, this broken, mess, failure as a human being. I can't even do my serving job without causing problems and being demoted. I couldn't get through cosmetology school. I feel the suicidal thoughts creeping in again, something I thought I'd conquered long ago. 

My father died when I was young and I was left utterly alone by my extended family with my profoundly ill mother. I was 16, and often afraid to go to school because she was threatening to kill herself everyday. I had nightmares about coming home and finding her dead. My fiance went through a period of depression earlier this month that led to him threatening suicide and it did something to me. He's now in treatment and improving and I'm still a mess. 

Because I believe my mother has a big part in why I'm so anxious, I feel so sorry for my children. I'm afraid I'm going to emotionally break them. I want to apologize to my children, my co-workers, my fiance, my roommate, my mother. Everyone who got stuck with me. This is taking over my life so thoroughly that I am finding it hard to see any light at the end of the tunnel, even though my fiance is arranging for me to see a doctor this week. 

I freak out if I see certain numbers on a clock, convinced that something bad is going to happen to me as a result. I just looked down and saw that it's 8:13, a bad number, and now I know something bad's going to happen to me today. I'm scared. I just want to go to bed. That's so crazy I can't even believe I'm typing it, but it's something that affects my mindstate daily and has for as long as I can remember. 

I don't know why I'm posting this. I just need to get it out I guess. I'm not sure anyone can do anything for me. I want to run away and stop hurting everyone. ",6,2012-02-06 16:18:34 EST-0500
613,Physical Symptoms of Anxiety,"Hey guys.  

Long story short I've been doing much better over the past week. However, yesterday morning for whatever reason when I woke up I felt the need to check my heartbeat. No physical symptoms at that time. And by ""check my heartbeat"" I mean, placing my hand/fingers on top of where my heart is and feeling it beat. I know this is the WORST thing you can possible do, but I can't help it sometimes. I'm paranoid. After doing that, I went to my counseling appointment, and told my counselor that I was doing much better, which was true. 

After my counseling appointment, I got some lunch and returned to my dorm. As I was eating my lunch I noticed the physical symptoms came on. And by physical symptoms, I mean, feeling like I lose my breath for a second, or feeling my heart beat (palpitation).  I've had this feeling before so it didn't freak me out or cause me to panic, but it was very uncomfortable. I ended up taking a .5mg ativan to relieve those symptoms, which angered me because I haven't needed an antivan in over a week. 

Today I woke up, everything was totally fine. As a prepared to go out and grab some lunch, I noticed myself becoming slightly anxious, and then i started getting those physical symptoms again..  I have never experienced chest pain with these, and I feel really bad for those who have experienced ""worse"" symptoms.  HOWEVER  I'm hoping some of you guys can relate to what I'm going through, and maybe offer some tips? 

I'm now looking into going to see a psychiatrist, to go along with seeing my university's counseling services.  

basically the shortness of breath / palpitation symptoms are the scariest shit ever.  Sometimes it feels like it lasts a few seconds, and sometimes it feels like it lasts a split second.

So reddit, how do you cope with your anxiety issues?",18,2012-02-03 15:28:25 EST-0500
615,The thought of relationships (a girlfriend) drives me to sickness.,"I'm a frequent on the depression reddit but I also have really bad anxiety when it comes to things. I'm 20 years old, in college and I'm in such an odd position. I'm an average looking guy, not muscular and athletic but not much weight either. I'm confident (sometimes) and know how to talk to girls, socialize and make them laugh. I've talked to girls years ago I wouldn't even think I'm worthy looking at. So I have conquered that mountain.

I've been on 3 dates. First two never amounted any further The last one was with a girl I spent about 2 years being a friend with until finally we went out. We'd always cuddle together and such and one time we kissed. After that, anytime I was alone with her I would become physically sick. I'd have to excuse myself to the bathroom and I'd proceed to throw up like crazy.

When we finally went out the night went as perfectly as you could have asked it to go. Only one problem, my anxiety would continue to grip me so firmly I had to throw up in the restaurant bathroom, several times. She wanted to go back to her house and spend some time together alone. I knew what that was coming to and my stomach was in complete knots. Eventually she caught on and was confused why every time we were together I got sick. I had to spill the beans, I felt maybe if I told her I'd feel better. I did not. I continued to dry heave the entire night until I left her home

Long story short, we don't talk anymore, I think she found a new guy and I sit here alone. The truth is, relationships scare the living hell out of me. I want one so badly but the thought of one puts my stomach through knots. I look at people who are happily in one, and so casual about it and I just wonder ""HOW?!"" and ""WHY IS IT SO HARD FOR ME?! CAN'T I JUST BE NORMAL! WHYYY!?""

I hate this. I hate this fear. I would love nothing more then to experience a relationship with a girl, I've been waiting so long. But this grip of anxiety just ruins me. I'm so scared it's going to continue to ruin me.

Needless to say this does nothing to help me with my depression.

617,Any advice on how to handle school-related anxiety?,"I've had Major Depression for a few years now - since I was 19 (I'm 23 now, nearly 24). I hate the idea of going on long-term medication, especially since my depression originally started as situational depression that was made infinitely worse with no reprieve over the course of several months, and became more permanent.

I recently, with the help of a good friend, got back into school (after having had to leave due to the same reasons as the onset of my depression). It's been fine for the past semester or two, but lately my depression's been getting in the way, and this week has been an absolute nightmare - I have three midterm exams on Wednesday I'm not prepared for, and another the very next day, not to mention a dentist appointment tomorrow morning that they wouldn't let me cancel. For the past few days I've been in a state of blind panic - every time I think about those exams, or try to study, I freak out. I fall into this horrible feeling of ""Oh my god they're too soon, I don't have enough time to learn the material and I can't do this!!!"", and the only way to stop the panic is to shut it out completely - play a video game and immerse myself for a few hours.

It feels good to play, but the minute I stop, I realize how much study time I just lost, and I panic again. It's been like this for days, and I don't know how to stop it. My exams are in less than 40 hours, does anyone have any tips on how to stop freaking out and actually get some work done? I've tried arranging group study dates with friends, but none have gone through (either the friend was sick or just didn't want to).

In the meantime, I'm trying to cope by myself. 

Does anyone else test their anxiety? A lot of the time, if I notice that I haven't really felt too anxious all day, I will subconsciously think of something to trigger an attack. I will do this before I can even stop myself. It's like I'm checking to see if the anxiety is mysteriously gone. This just makes me anxious and feel out of control, because it's not gone. It's like my own mind is working against me. Then, I start feeling like if I even think about that bad thing, it will cause it to happen to me. Then I try to distract myself, which only makes everything cycle around and make me think about it more. It's a never-ending cycle.

Now I am on super high alert and I just can't calm down, I am so upset. Vomiting is the worst thing in the world. I would rather do anything else, anything. I just so can't deal with pain and disgust and illness. I'm a recovering hypochondriac I guess so it is just so difficult being sick, always has been. I have no idea how to deal with pain at all. Not the weird drawn out organ-borne pain of sickness.

622,Fear of having a severe allergic reaction (my story).,"Please forgive my rambling post but, I’d like to give some back story on my fear anxiety. First off I should say there is a history of mental disorder in my family. Specifically with depression, alcoholism, and anxiety. When I was a kid, in junior high I started experiencing symptoms of anxiety. As embarrassing as it is, I would just feel like I needed to poop every time I would go out in public. For a little while I missed out on school and youth group just because every time I left the house I felt anxious, and like I was going to crap my pants. With the help of a guidance counselor we determined that at least in part my anxiety was caused in part by the anticipation of moving from junior high to high school. One day we took a trip to the high school for a tour, and shortly thereafter my anxiety started to subside, and eventually went away.

Fast forward several years, after graduating college and working for a few years, I started to develop anxiety issues seemingly out of the blue. There were some external stresses at the time. My sister had been recently diagnosed with anorexia and had been hospitalized struggling to maintain a healthy weight (she is healthy and doing well now). My grandfather had been diagnosed with cancer, and despite aggressive treatment the cancer continued to grow and we knew he would probably pass away soon. I was not stressed at work, but I was generally unhappy and wished my career was moving forward. I felt at the time my career was simply stagnating.

I would say at this time I was depressed. I was more often than not feeling unhappy; unsatisfied with my situation, but completely lacked motivation to do anything about it. I felt tired all the time, and on top of that I started drinking regularly to try to manage my depression. Not drinking a lot (probably 2-3 drinks per night), but enough that I felt like I had a dependency which increased my depression even further.

Anyway back to the anxiety part… One day before work I started feeling anxious. No specific thoughts associated with the anxiety. Just a feeling of fear. Not knowing where the feelings came from I tried to shrug them off hoping I would feel better the next day. A few days passed and the feelings did not go away. I woke up every morning with that feeling of fear, and feeling sick to my stomach. Often I would even dry heave because the feeling of nausea was so apparent.

Then something strange happened. That general feeling of fear developed into a specific phobia. I am allergic to fish/shellfish and have known about it since a very young age. The severity of my allergy has never been determined, but I know I have never had what I would describe as a severe reaction. The worst I have experienced is a very unpleasant from my skin coming in contact with seafood, and when I was younger (before my allergy was known) some itching in my throat from consumption.

Regardless; my general feeling of fear, turned into a phobia about fish. Specifically about being killed by an allergic reaction. I started becoming increasingly paranoid about seafood contaminating my food. Often at meals I would take a few bites, and then my anxiety would cause an itchy, swelling feeling in my throat. I would leave the table, and try to calm myself down. Obviously there was no reaction, but regardless I would remain fearful, and could not finish my meal. This caused me to become more and more cut off from my family and friends, since most social situations involve eating one way or the other.

I refused to go out to restaurants using any excuse I could. I refused hanging out with my friends fearing we would end up in a “food situation.” I didn’t want to visit anyone's house just in-case they had been cooking fish recently. “What if it smells like fish?” I would think to myself “I could have a reaction.” In about a year I lost about 15 pounds due to the inability to finish a meal.

After much mental anguish, and month of trying to convince myself there was no problem, I finally got a therapist. Because of my fear I was not even able to tolerate having my therapy sessions indoors (there was a sushi restaurant in the same plaza). My therapist was able to teach me some techniques to help me calm down and manage my fear day to day. Eventually I was comfortable again eating meals in my own home, and was able to function normally at work day to day. While I was able to manage my fear day to day I still had that over arching fear; I could no feel comfortable going to restaurant or to my friends home.

To this day, nearly 2 years later I still have the same fear. I am still uncomfortable going out to restaurants (though I do manage once and a while), but more importantly I still remain detached from my friends and family. I still have that nagging fear. “What if they’ve cooked fish. If there place has a fish smell I could swell up and die.” “What if we go out to eat and they forget about my allergy, I could swell up and die.” “I could die… I could die… I could die.”  That’s all I hear over and over again in my head. I desperately want my friends and my social life back, but my fear overrides all of that.

The worst part about it is I recognize 100% the logical fallacy in my fear, but still let it command my life. I have gone 26 years without so much as a “note to the chef” about my allergy without issue. I have sat next to friends eating fish and chips and never experienced a reaction. In fact the only reaction I remember having in recent memory was a rash due to someone leaving stinky fish in the fridge at work and the smell getting on my lunch container. Even then it was just an unpleasant rash which was gone by the next morning.
None the less I have this nagging fear which wont go away, and it’s ruining my life.

I only have one clue as to what caused this (aside from general stress in my life). In a short span of time there were several “exposures.” #1) Dropped by a friends house. At the time they were eating fish chowder. Due to the smell I felt the need to leave within a few minutes. #2) Had a meeting at a client site. Someone heated fish in the kitchen. Again I felt the need to vacate within a matter of minutes. #3) The day after the client meeting someone in my workplace heated some strong smelling fish and again I felt the need to leave.

So now I am. Here, 2 years later. Still anxious, still depressed, still drinking “moderately” every day. Shut in my home isolated from my friends, with this feeling that just wont go away. I’ve lived my whole life with this allergy and is never caused an issue, but now it’s my mind, instead of my body that’s killing me.

I feel like I am ruining my own life and I have no idea what do do about it.

I'll be in the pitch dark, and I can't breathe properly because I'm hyperventilating, and sometimes can't even move to put the light on. Then I'll be scared that I'm dying, which makes me panic more.

Normally if I can't recover from a panic attack I'll go and wake up one of my housemates to calm me down.  It's really unfair, I know, and I feel really pathetic every time I do it. I appologise every time and each time I do it I tell myself it's the last time.

A few nights ago I had the worst panic attack of my whole life.  I'd been on a massive low for the entire day and nothing could pull me out of it.  I'd also seen my counsellor that day, which always makes me more emotional, and I'd yelled at a priest, which made me feel worse about myself.  I was lying awake in bed thinking, *I can't go on like this any longer*.  And then I thought, *If nothing has changed by the new year, I'll kill myself.*

I'd had suicidal thoughts before, but never something as final or drastic as that.  And the idea that I could feel that bad about myself pushed me over the edge into full-on panic attack.  Sweating, shaking, writhing. Palpitations and hyperventilation. I had a loss of control, a sense of impending death I'd never felt before.  I was also face-down in my bed, face in my pillow, and I couldn't move because it was so intense.  My breathing was getting faster and shallower. I was going to suffocate, and I was trapped in my own panicking body.  There was no escape.

I managed to pull my arm out from underneath me and reach for my phone, and called my housemate, who I have as my first speed-dial.  I wasn't able to speak. I tried to say I was having a panic attack but my breathing was too fast to say anything. My memory gets fuzzy at that point.  I think he asked where I was and I might have managed to get out ""bed"". Next thing I know he's in my room and the light is on and I've been pulled into a sitting position and he helped me to breathe.

It took a while for me to calm down, and much longer to get to sleep. When I called him, he thought I'd done something stupid. I feel horrible. For waking him up, for scaring him, for being a terrible, ineffectual, selfish mess of a human being.

I'm pretty sure if I hadn't managed to phone him I'd have died.  That scares the hell out of me.  And confuses me.  The reason I had the attack in the first place was because I wanted to die.  Was my body fighting my head, trying to get me to live?  I don't know whether I want to live or die any more.  For now, I just exist.

But what if he wasn't there?  What if I had nobody?  At the moment, my house is empty. I'm alone, in the middle of the night, in an empty house.  If I had another attack that bad, I might not be able to calm myself down.

I began panicking about that, and it almost turned into another panic attack.  Then I decided to write this post. And writing about it has calmed me down a little, and made me feel less pathetic.  Thank you for reading.

Please, don't worry about me too much. I'm seeing a counsellor, and trying to remember that people care about me.",9,2012-12-17 03:17:23 EST-0500

636,How do i convince my mind i am safe,"I've been having anxiety problems for about 3 months now, and i finally went to a therapist yesterday. He told me about the fight or flight response humans develop when the mind perceives a threat. I was thinking about that in the shower yesterday and it really put everything into perspective. I realized i was making up all these things that where wrong in my head to make sense of my anxiety, and as a result that was causing me more anxiety because the things i convinced myself were wrong with me were unfix-able. So in short I'm in this Fight or flight limbo. Anyway do you guys have any advice on how to convince my mind i'm safe now? I ask because I've convinced myself that i have to fight now and i'm projecting my anger unto things and people and that's making anxious as fuck because i don't want to hurt the things i'm convincing are causing the problem, and shit even i know these things aren't causing the problem. That's the thing too; I realize that i'm safe in theory, but a part of me can't come to accept that. 

TL;DR: How do i convince my subconscious i'm safe and there's nothing wrong with me.    ",13,2012-12-21 20:41:34 EST-0500

641,Anxiety makes me a quitter.,"Whenever something is hard, I get anxiety attacks and I give up on it. Everything in my life has been like that. I dropped out of high school, quit two jobs, and gave up on many things I liked.
Sometimes I don't think I'm good enough, or that I can't do it. It's just easier not to do anything than to try. What if I try and I fail? 
At least if I don't try, I can't fail. but being a quitter is worse than being a failure because I didn't even try. 
I'm in this vicious cycle and I don't know how to get out. 
My anxiety used to be so bad that I couldn't sleep because I was so scared I wouldn't wake up. I'm on a medication that took away all the severe symptoms like that, but everything just seems like it's too much and I can't do it.

644,"This morning I boarded a flight, vomited before take-off and was not allowed to fly. Please help with my fear of flying. ","I am a a male teenager, who has a fear of flying. Pretty much every time I fly, I will throw up a few times. 

As I get to the airport, my stomach already starts to feel horrible. It gradually gets worse, until I eventually throw up. I was originally going to the US from Australia, which is about 26 hours in total (2 transfers). I've never travelled so far, and I think this is the reason I was so fearful of the flight.

As I sat down in my seat on the plane, I began to feel extremely nauseous, and then promptly threw up. I was shaking quite violently at that point. I went to the back of the plane to see the flight attendant, who helped me clean myself up. Then, I threw up again while at the back of the plane.  I was told that I was not allowed to fly, as the airline was concerned that I had such a long way to fly, and that I would not be able to last through it all. I was told to see a doctor before flying again. 12 hours after that experience, I still feel horrible. 

I have always known I was scared of flying to a certain degree, but this just got out of hand. Please, I need help. ",13,2012-12-16 19:35:35 EST-0500
645,This shit is ruining my life. ,"This is all new for me. I dont know what I'm supposed to do. I'm mostly sure that whatever I do, if I do anything at all, will be wrong. Or, at least, someone will think its wrong and will be disappointed. 

This isn't supposed to happen to me... All I'm trying to do with my life is get through college; how hard does it really have to be? 

I graduated community college with a 3.89 GPA, and transferred to one of the best 4-year schools in the country. Suddenly, I can't focus on anything or take a relevant note to save my life. 

I've been to a psychologist twice, to be evaluated for ADD or ADHD. The psychologist seems to think that I did, in fact, have a severe case of ADHD as a child, but because I was always well-above grade level in literally -everything- in school, I've compensated for it, and it was never really a problem. I filled out a number of surveys, and he said that I scored very high for anxiety, which is probably triggering the ADHD symptoms. I'm currently within normal limits for ADHD -- He doesn't think its the primary issue. 

Of course, the psychologist couldn't help me, because I don't have text-book symptoms. He referred me out to a psychiatrist. A real-live, for reals, serious, went-to-med-school-and-everything diagnoser of crazy. 

Hello, anxiety over having something actually *wrong* with me. I've been to all sorts of doctors before, for all sorts of things. But this is scary. I can't even think about it without crying. 

I've had two incidents in the last few months that are a bit alarming to me, and I've mentioned them to the doctor. I'm not sure I'd call them panic attacks. They both happened at totally normal, run-of-the-mill social gatherings. Both times, I got really nervous and scared and started crying for no fucking identifiable reason. None at all. The first time, I literally just got up, left, and took a cab home crying. The second time, I had some tequila, and I managed to sit quietly alone with my eyes shut for a few minutes and re-center myself, a little. 

Like I said, this is new for me. And I don't know whats brought it on. [I'm not the expert -- This is why I'm seeing a psychiatrist.] I feel like I've exhausted and frustrated every person who is close enough to me to actually know whats going on, and I've successfully hidden it from the rest. 

I wish someone understood that I don't need or want anyone to solve my problems for me. I want someone to sit silently beside me when I freak out, and just let me fucking process, without interjecting their own opinions, or saying things that dismiss or invalidate the way I feel in that moment. I don't need to hear yet -another- person telling me ""Everything will be fine, don't worry, this is silly, it will all work out, etc."" 

I feel alone, stupid, and lost. I feel like a complete fucking nut job.

648,"Guys, I found an incredibly effective and beautiful way to fight my GAD/hypochondria.","Diagnosed with GAD 5 Months ago, my life has been terrible since then. Anyway, a few weeks ago I read somewhere that hypnotherapy is a very effective way of treating anxiety disorders so I thought ""Why the fuck not, I've got nothing to lose."". Went on Youtube and found a few self-hypnosis sessions for anxiety. I tried out all of them and found one that touched me in particular. The first time listening to it.. was a BLAST. I felt so very much at peace and was completely worry-free. So over the course of the next 10 days, I listened to it every day before bed. And now the clenching anxiety I used to have is just.. almost completely gone. I still have trouble believing it. I don't usually believe in spiritual crap like that, but self-hypnosis is the biggest gift I could've ever been given.

This is the session that I use (yes, the woman looks great, but it's the best video I could find, believe me - she is amazing): 

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=syL1fyEQKJs&feature=youtube_gdata_player

How to use: Lay down on your back, put earbuds in, turn the lights off, just listen, follow the instructions, imagine everything she says as if it was true and just put your worries aside for a few minutes - you can continue worrying afterwards if you still feel like it.

658,[help] Anxiety keeping me scared to do anything productive.,"Somehow I ended up here after a long night of lurking and this reddit seems relevant to me, so thought I would make my first post. 

I find myself too scared to do almost anything these days, I'll look for any excuse to avoid leaving my room. Even things I'm passionate about I have a hard time focusing on and an even harder time forcing myself to do them. I have a lot of goals that I want to accomplish but I feel like I have an enormous weight on my shoulders that I just can't shake.

To give a little background I'm 21 years old and I've dealt with anxiety and depression for five years now. When I was 16 I went through some traumatic experiences and ended up severely depressed. When I turned 18 I got professional help and got myself a GED. Now i'm in college making good grades and happier than I've ever been before. The problem is my anxiety is sticking around as a bad reminder of those dark days and lately it's been getting worse. I want to push myself to accomplish my goals and truly reach what i'm capable of, but every time I try it's almost like an invisible wall stays my hand and keeps me from doing it. I'm currently seeing a therapist but I can't afford to see him as often as I would like and I find that in between visits i'm at my worst. Where do I go from here? I don't want all i've suffered through to be for nothing, I don't want to live a life where I'm scared to go out with my friends, I want to finally be rid of this.

660,[Relaxing] The only thing that has ever helped me...hear me out...,"is marijuana. It keeps me from having panic attacks and calms me down when I am stressed or upset. It bring me down from a really frantic horrible state of mind and makes me functional. Smoking before doing my homework has improved my grades and kept me from dropping out of college. When I smoke I'm also a lot more patient. When I'm really frantic and I smoke just a little, I don't get confrontational or angry with people that don't deserve it like my parents or my friends. Marijuana has done a lot to improve the quality of my daily life.
The thing is, trees are the only thing that really work for me. I've tried prescription medications and they all give me really bad side effects and make me sick. Plus they make me hazy, so I can't concentrate on anything and usually end up going to sleep. My mom was addicted to Xanax for a long time, so on top of being really sensitive and reacting badly to these pills, I have anxiety about taking the pills because I have the gene for addiction on both sides of my family.

The reason I'm telling you this is not because I want everyone to chuck their pills and be stoned all day. I only smoke a small amount for anxiety relief (I smoke larger amounts recreationally) and really all it does it keep away the racing thoughts and constant worry. Its a delicate balance, if I smoke too much when I'm already feeling really down it just makes me unmotivated and I feel worse. If I just enough before I start to feel bad or panicky, it keeps me from spiraling and helps me to focus.

I stopped smoking for a while (for several reasons) and found that within a day or two I was constantly panicked and couldn't get anything done. I was worrying about everything, things that didn't make sense to worry about, getting panic attacks about things that didn't matter. This is what my life had been every day before I found what worked for me, and I never want to go back there again. 

Anxiety is a mental illness, which means it can be treated, and more importantly, its NOT YOUR FAULT. Finding a solution to my anxiety and depression problems made me feel like myself again, happy and fulfilled and calm, when for YEARS I was sure that I would feel horrible for the rest of my life.

Marijuana is what works for me. It might be what works for you. It might not be. It took a while for me to work with my therapist to figure out when and how much I should smoke to gain the right effects. I also smoke certain strains that I know help more than hinder me. 

Just keep pushing! Looking for an answer and knowing that a happy you is waiting just beneath all the worry, fear and sadness you may feel right now. Things will get better. As someone who was where many of you are a few months ago, I can tell you it sure as hell is worth the fight.",21,2012-06-12 11:00:29 EDT-0400

668,Physical symptoms are too painful. What can I do?,"My anxiety has gotten *a lot* better in terms of the mental aspect. I can logic and reason about my social anxiety, I can confront my anxiety about irrational fears and it eases my sanity and mind. I am thankful for this.

But the physical aspects are somehow worse, longer and more painful. All it took today was to imagine some hurtful scenario that has not happened, will not happen and has *no basis in reality.* Mentally, I could challenge it and realize ""That's just fear-mongering, I have no need to worry about that."" (In the past those little thought devils would have me worrying about it for hours, days, months. But I was able to stop it today.) However, my body didn't get the memo. 

My chest has been hurting for over an hour. My hands are shaking, my shoulders ache as if I've been lifting heavy weights. My legs feel like jelly. My heart rate has risen, not by as much as it *feels* like, but it's still above average right now if I count it. Mouth is dry and if I take a drink of water, I feel sick and it's difficult to swallow it. Stomach hurts, and I'm feeling nauseous. Haven't eaten today, and I'd like to, but I can't right now. My breathing is too quick, I'm trying to do deep breathing, but that only lasts for the moment. This feels so wrong, I know I'm making progress mentally, but physically, I feel much, much worse to the point where I'm a bit scared right now.

It's too much, this hasn't subsided yet. Sometimes this pain lasts for a few minutes, sometimes hours, sometimes it'll carry over until morning. My body feels like it's at war. This hurts, physically, more than it should. I have no idea what's wrong or how to help it.

Beta blockers are just for blood pressure/heart right? What about just general pain? It's *everywhere*, mostly in my chest, arms and stomach. I'm not the biggest fan of medication as I often have averse side effects, but I want something for these physical symptoms. It is too much to handle. I know this is going to last all night, I know the rest of my day is going to be spent doubled over in pain. I want to just lay down and cry, it's not going away. ",21,2012-06-13 23:03:06 EDT-0400
669,Can we go yet? [Mind Dump],"I think I can sum up my anxiety by those four words- Can we go yet? 

As a kid, I remember going places with my parents, friends, and relatives and being overcome by an intense disinterest in the activity we were doing. Maybe we had been shopping too long, driving too far, in the sun getting too hot, or whatever. I would start whining that I wanted to leave, to go home. I know most children experience this feeling. I hear kids asking their parents to go home all the time. From what I have seen with my nieces and nephews, they can handle the response of ""We will leave in a few minutes."" When this would happen to me as a child, when I could not leave, I would start to feel sick to my stomach, to cry to myself, and become increasingly uncomfortable until I would experience an anxiety attack or until my parents would take me home. I never threw temper tantrums though; it was a very internalized thing and not a way to control others around me. Once i would get home, I would take me hours to calm down to normal. Once I was old enough to stay home alone, I all but ceased going on family outings.

At 36, I still remember the intensity of that feeling of wanting to go *away*. I don't know why I made the connection today between the way my anxiety feels as an adult and that type of anxiety I felt as a kid, but the more I think about it, the more I realize that symptomatically and cognitively they are very similar. 

When I feel panic/anxiety coming on, I Immediately want to stop what I am doing and leave from where I am. Just go somewhere else. This even happens when I am at home. Usually the desired destination is home, my safe place. So when I have panic/anxiety at home, it is doubly intense. I am the type of person who cannot go on vacations because of the fear of panic attacks. What is that except for a manifestation of me asking ""Can we go yet?"" and getting a big fat ""NO"" for an answer? I also must be the person driving. I simply cannot stand to be a passenger in a vehicle. Again, that would imply a ""NO"" to my anxiety's plea to flee. I cannot work full time because I can't handle being out of a safe zone so long and being required to ask for permission to leave. 

What does this all mean and what do I do with it? Is it an indication that i suffered from an anxiety disorder starting at a young age? Did all the times that I could not escape an uncomfortable situation as a child build up and form an anxiety disorder? Does this mean that something really bad happened to me as a kid that I can't remember?

672,"[Help] Anxiety over wether or not to report my ""mental illness"" as a disability to my college","Basically I'm transferring to real college in the spring. Now, I can report myself as having mental illnesses which I have which would give me some advantages that I could use probably. But I feel that if I do report it, people are going to judge me. The main advantage for me is in housing. I need a single room when getting a dorm and well this is harder to do. I don't know if it's worth it. I also would make sure I have a psychatrist from school check in on me periodically but I don't know if I want that either. I'm really in a whole mess of what to do. ",13,2012-06-13 07:16:40 EDT-0400
673,Paranoid and anxious about my relationships,"I know this is a common theme with those of us who suffer with anxiety, but it seems to be getting worse lately. I pretty much operate under the suspicion that everyone hates me. 

It starts with the simplest things. It could be someone's tone of voice, or a fleeting look of confusion or disapproval that absolutely sets me off. I will leave and obsess over it for days. I'm scared to talk to people because I don't want to give them more reasons to hate me. I always second guess myself when I speak. 

My anxiety usually takes the form of an impending sense of doom. I become restless and feel as though something horrible is going to happen. Sometimes my heart feels like it's going to explode out of my chest.  I also have obsessive thoughts. I can't stop thinking things like ""you should be embarrassed of yourself"", or ""I hate myself"". I just feel overcome by shame over the stupidest things.

Like, okay. This morning, as I was leaving church, I complimented the pastor on his sermon. He thanked me. That was the extent of our conversation. I don't know him well- we've only spoken a couple of times. He is a very nice man. So why do I think I saw a flash of annoyance in his eyes? I just felt so embarrassed of myself, like I shouldn't have said anything. He didn't do anything wrong, I'm sure he was genuinely appreciative. What is wrong with me? Why can't I trust people to be honest about the way the feel about me? Why do I care if they think I'm annoying or stupid?

I just assume that people think very lowly of me. Even the ones who are closest to me. When people compliment me I think they're lying or making fun of me. I have a hard time talking to people about it. I confessed this to one of my closest friends recently, and he was very reassuring that he cared about me a lot. I believe him logically, but why don't I FEEL like it's true?

679,Fellow anxiety sufferers of the internet: What do you think of this mini-revelation?,"I cant speak for anyone else but for me one of the most annoying things about anxiety is the difficulty in explaining what it ""is"".  People will ask ""well what are you anxious about?""...or ""what are you thinking about?""....or ""well what does it feel like?"".  And there will never be one word or phrase or paragraph in a textbook that will explain it fully, especially since it manifests so differently in so many people (and even within the same people, it will do so differently in different situations). BUT. I found a way to sort of describe the feeling in the back of your head when your anxiety takes up all ability to concentrate.

Does anyone else feel like theres just ""television static"" in their head?  Not the NOISE from it, not the image or anything like that, just a weird...sensation of ""buzzing"" going on in your mind.  You can't shut it off, and you can't ""change the channel"" to something more rational or more productive...so it's like wasted thoughts.  They're there, they're occupying the space where rational thought and productivity SHOULD be, but at the same time its completely useless. But you can't shut it off.

Thoughts? Really seeking people to relate to ATM.

680,How Do You Gain Confidence? This isn't normal right?,"I'm a girl, 22, in university. I'm pretty quiet/shy unless ppl speak to me first, and then I'm really friendly although kind of nervous. 
I've never been on a date or had a bf before. Guys and girls have said I'm really pretty/cute but still guys don’t really approach me, most just stare, and on the rare occasion when some guy does try to strike up a convo, I’ll screw things up somehow and make them think I’m not interested. (I have trouble making eye contact with strangers especially if it’s someone I’m interested in, and I just can’t smile at guys I like.) Because this is all so hard for me, I’ve come to find “flirting” frustrating, draining, and ultimately just depressing. I want a relationship but the stress, potential embarrassment, and uncertainty is just too much so I tend to avoid anyone I find attractive. (I don’t really crush a lot anyway, maybe 1 or 2/year.)... Honestly I don't see myself asking out guys anytime soon.",29,2012-02-23 20:08:15 EST-0500
681,I'd like to offer some practical suggestions.,"Hello fellow anxietors.

I'm a 30 year-old man who's suffered from moderate-to-severe anxiety for a long long time. My earliest anxiety memories are when I was in 4th grade - I'd wake up in the middle of night thinking that I was going to die. I'd freak out and run to my parents' bedroom where my mom would reassure me that I'm ok. I had anxiety in social situations, and I was extremely anxious when talking to girls. I would get pretty anxious before school exams and events, and usually not eat that day before the test because my heart would be racing and my stomach would be in knots.

Around the beginning of high-school, I developed a severe case of hypochondria. It started from learning about the human body works, and how things can go wrong. I still have hypochondria to this day and it's by far the biggest source of my anxiety. My anxiety is not limited to health though, and I generally obsess and worry about everything under the sun. Some days are better than others. Sometimes (like right now), I feel good. Not superb, but good. Other days I'm miserable and have panic attacks (I had a few of them this last week). 

At any rate, things are much better now than they used to be. I'd like to share the different weapons I've amassed against anxiety. Keep in mind that what may work for me, may not work for you. These are just some suggestions, but perhaps they're a good place to start. Play around with the details and see if they work for you. I tried to find as many different types of weapons in this fight as possible.

Here we go:

* Exercise: I think a lot of people here know about this, but it's tough to do when you're too anxious to go to the gym or even leave the house. Still, working out vigorously has helped me a shit-ton. I try to get some exercise every day. In my opinion, a mix of weights and cardio is the best.

* Medicine: Find a friendly GP and just get a prescription for Xanax (and any other benzo of your choosing). It's not that hard and it completely takes the edge off **in times of need**. Don't rely on it all the time, but have it there as a backup plan for when those shitty anxiety attacks hit. Xanax has been an extremely useful tool for me.

* Supplements: There are ton of supplements out there. Do your research and look for [anxiolytics](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anxiolytic). I've wasted a lot of money and time trying different ones, but the most potent ones that have worked were: L-theanine, Aniracetam, and Phosphatidylserine.

* Meditation: This is an area where I slack myself, but it really does help. Usually the problem is that you can't even start if you're too anxious.  Still, there are studies after studies that show the calming effect of meditation. It doesn't have to be complicated - just a simple sit-down with a breathe-in, breathe-out focus would probably calm you down a lot.

* People: Try to surround yourself with people that understand what you're going through. If they simply can't understand or can't relate, they're probably not good for you as friends, and you're better off without them. Same goes for significant others - it's better to be lonely than to be with someone who can't understand and help you out with your situation. I know I wouldn't be able to control my anxiety without my wonderful wife. She is truly supportive of my situation and helps me out a lot. In return I try to pay back the favor by trying my best to be an awesome husband. It pays off in the long run.

* Philosophy: Finally, get into some philosophy and try to ponder what the meaning of life is, why you're here, etc. Try to think about why you're so afraid of death, or why you're so afraid of suffering, and question it. An excellent lecture series that has helped me a lot in dealing with death is a free course offered by Yale: http://academicearth.org/courses/death. The professor, Shelly Kagan, is very concise and thorough and the arguments make you think quite a bit. Perhaps it'll help you come to terms with death. There are many courses like this online, for free.

That's it for now. If you have any questions, please ask. If you have any suggestions, please post them. 
Peace.

TL;DR - take a deep breath and read the post, you might find it useful.",11,2012-02-24 11:38:57 EST-0500

683,"Sometimes, it's like I'm watching reality through a window.","Sometimes, it's like I'm watching reality through a window. I was in my car the other day, sitting at the park. Getting out of the house. I needed fresh air and time away from the computer. I was staring at the trees and ground through my window, and I realized that that is exactly how I feel all of the time. I rolled the window down, and I still felt like I was looking at the trees through a window. Sometimes, it's like I'm watching me watch me through a window. Sometimes, it's like I'm watching static.

Dissociation symptoms from anxiety like depersonalization and derealization have seemingly become better over time, but being ""derealized"" is becoming more noticeable. For the longest time, I have ""doubted"" my reality because I just don't like it too much. I'm only nineteen, but I feel older than that, nowadays. I don't really feel anything.

I step outside, and I don't feel the warmth that I remember feeling. Everything is darker than it used to be. The air doesn't seem as clean and refreshing. Nobody around me feels alive. I don't feel alive. Without these simple sensations every day, I think anyone would doubt their sanity.

So here I am, doubting my sanity. I keep flip-flopping between two thoughts: ""I'm not insane, but there are reasons to believe that,"" and ""If I doubt my sanity for just one second, I *must* be insane."" Each day, it's as if the longer I am awake (and not usually for longer than the usual sixteen hours), the faster my thoughts seem to go, the less I seem to feel, until by the time I go to bed, I tell myself that I'm feeling psychotic, and when I wake up the next day, I realize just how ""psychotic"" I really did feel before.

I get that feeling every day I wake up. The feeling that the day previous was bullshit, that I was insane, that I was not in my right mind, and I can find a million reasons to convince myself of this.

So Reddit, I ask you for your help. I *know* I have dealt with a lot of anxiety, and over time, the way it has affected my perception and senses has become quite noticeable. Now, I'm doubting my sanity because of it. Could it be possible that I'm getting a bit of schizophrenia? Sometimes I hear things, and sometimes I see things in my head, and sometimes I tend to attribute behaviors or entire days to delirium because of that ""next day"" feeling I get every day. Is my anxiety just getting ridiculous? Has anyone else experienced anything like this before? The ""not feeling anything"" and ""doubting sanity"" stuff, it's been really bugging me lately.

Thanks for any replies, and I can go into more detail about this ""psychosis"" I've been feeling if I need to. I have been diagnosed with GAD.",10,2012-02-26 21:39:10 EST-0500

I've posted a few threads here before and atm I need a little help because its 3:30 am where I live so no one is awake. I don't know who else to talk to so I'm writing here. 
I had anxiety attacks in the past and then they got better.  Then I developed Hypochondria from it...
Usually my thoughts go to cancer and whatnot. I'm constantly on my phone or WebMD looking for symptoms of something I KNOW I don't have but...I still think I do for the moment. 

Last thursday I thought I had epilepsy.  I don't.  At least I don't think so. 

This week, I'm getting over a cold. No fever, just bad congestion. And just a little while ago, I woke up with sharp pains in my chest on the right side. I've had these pains before, last year when I was getting over a cold. My brain went straight to Pulmonary Embolism. I NEVER would have thought of it, if my boyfriend's mom didnt mention it on Monday (she was talking about someone else)
I woke up and it took everything in me to not grab my phone and look up symptoms of P.E.'s  I was freaking out. I still am.

I don't know what to do. I don't have health insurance yet (still pending : /) and I don't want to go to the hospital, but my irrational mind wants me to...
So obviously I haven't seen a mental health doctor yet, either.

I don't know where else to turn. I'm sick of feeling like this. You guys have given me amazing advice before and I know I can't keep coming here for help, I need to see a doctor soon but I can't help this right now.

693,Memories from time before anxiety.,"About a week back it was evening and I was standing on the porch. The birds were singing spring songs, the grass was slowly getting back to green (I am in Georgia) and suddenly. Wham. I got a memory from
time before anxiety.. 

I was transported about 4800 miles to where I was born (Finland) and 21 years back in time.. I remembered the spring of 1991.. And for a while, it was not me, the anxious wreck watching at the birds.. Sensing the spring.. It was the me from time before anxiety..

The thing is. I got anxious. As probably a lot of you people out there. Because my senses are hyper sensitive. I used to connect to a moment in a very deep way. Feeling chills on my spine as the wind drew breath. 

Once some bad things started going down. (family went bankrupt, dad went to jail, uncle committed suicide, grandma died, a thief broke into house and held me and my little brother captive while ransacking the house.. You know the.. Usual stuff) 

That sensitivity.

 What could be considered a blessing, turned into a curse. Instead of using it to connect to spring nights. I was looking at the world and concentrated on all the bad things that had happened to me. Slowly that process turned me anxious and bitter..

But on that day a couple weeks back.

For the rest of that day I walked around in awe of that moment. Because I could remember the mental freedom I used to have. Being 17. Watching at the sky and listening to the birds, feeling one with the world, instead of being riddled with anxiety symptoms and pain..

Now. I could take it two ways. I could compare my life now to back then and make my pain even worse. But. Instead of doing that. I held on to the feeling here and there for the rest of the day. Accepting the difference, realizing how deeply anxiety has changed me. Accepting anxiety, accepting this life. Happy to have that memory from time before anxiety.

All you sensitive young people out there. Do not dredge the poop of the world into your brains. Because what ever you concentrate on, you will become. If you only look at how much the world sucks. Well. That is how you will start to feel on very deep level. And at that point. When you build your core being as a person who is negative and sees everything negative.. Anxiety happens..

once I'm done browsing reddit/facbook/email I just can't relax, my mind is going a mile a minute over all the things I'm anxious about. my two best friends are gone for the weekend and I don't have many other friends in the area, I hate feeling like I'm inviting myself over so I'll likely not talk to them. 

Anyone have any tips to getting through this alone, my go to is just to drink, but I am trying to cut back a lot on that. I may just go to work and do some extra work because that's one thing I can focus on in my life that's great and I love.

tl;dr: alone for the weekend, hep me cope? 

EDIT: thank you for the suggestions, I know I'm pretty negative in my responses, but I appreciate them nonetheless

EDIT2: I didn't get out of the house til 5 and then just to swing by the office to get something and buy some alcohol....maybe tomorrow I can stop being such a fuck up",11,2012-08-04 19:46:15 EDT-0400

717,"My thought pattern, how I plan to get better and how I plan to stop myself.","""She's pretty, I should ask her out""
""Don't be stupid, she wouldn't like someone like you""
""She might...""
""No she wont, no she wont, no she wont. Plus you work in the same building, imagine if it didn't work out, you'll look like an idiot having to walk past her every morning!""
""OK I wont ask her, you're right, I'm a looser""

This is a prime example of how my thoughts progress each day, it's a constant tug of war and I always finish second. I grew up with awesome parents, they treated me and my bro very well and they have become more like best friends to me in recent years, they beleve in me, they love me and they are proud of me.

Yet I treat myself like crap, there is a constant state of denial of my abilities as a human being. It's almost like I bully myself because there is no-one else to do it. I was bullied in school, I was never one of the ""cool kids"" I spent my first two years at high school in the library just hiding from the world.

These days all I really do is work, eat, sleep, smoke pot and feel sorry formyself. The once big circle of friends I had has dropped to around 2 or 3 people and even them I hardly feel I know anymore. The biggest word for me right now is Lonley.

I guess the first stage of getting better is recognising that this is happening to me and I'm the one making it happen.

How I plan to get better is to cut way back on smoking pot, start getting fit with regular exersice and start to eat better. The body is a temple you know.

722,"UPDATE: Changed the way my site shareyourfear.com works, now integrated with twitter.","As I had mentioned in the previous post, the site I created didn't turn out the way I wanted it to.  Now, I have made the process MUCH simpler.  There is no registration, however there is still a login.  I have created 3 different users to log in, once logged in you may begin to tweet and share what is on your mind, anonymously.

The 3 logins are as follows:

E.g. Username / password

AnxietySmith / anxietysmith
AnxietyJane / anxietyjane
Anonymous /anonymous

The reason I did this was to keep the connection between the original twitter account, as well as giving people the option to at least reveal gender based on Smith/Jane, or none at all. The name is supposed to appear at the end of the tweet but doesn't right now, something I will fix.

Anyways, I hope people find use for this, if not oh well.  As said previously, as someone who suffers from GAD and panic disorder, if I can help at least just one other person then it would make the work worthwhile.

Thanks for looking, cheers.

I feel like the moment I calm myself down and try to think rationally, another voice in my head says "" what if this time you're right? "". It annoys the shit out of me. For example today, I was going to take a cab to school but I had watched a scene of a car accident on tv the night before. It was stuck in my head for a bit and was too afraid to call the cab. Then I calmed myself down and then told myself.. "" don't be silly , what are the odds? It won't happen to you "". So I started calling the cab company and then all of a sudden my ""gut"" told me ""don't do it! What if you're right? Better safe than sorry!"" so I hung up the phone. Then I calmed myself down again and called the cab company anyway. I was late for class cause of that. Ugh.. Very annoying.. and really silly lol. Does this happen to any of you? Anyways..

729,[Relax] My therapist is a computer nerd,"I asked my therapist for a way to alleviate anxiety right before bed. It works perfectly for me being a computer nerd. Try this:

*Visualize a computer desktop with all of your worries as icons. Get as detailed or as vague as you like
*Categorize each of your worries into folders. I like to use Plausible and Implausible .
*Take your Implausible folder and delete it and, this is important, take your plausible folder and hide it in your imaginary Documents file. 

By this time you've probably got yourself a nice clean desktop to imagine. 

It sounds weird, but it's worked for me.

730,Has anyone else missed work over anxiety?,"The relations in my peer group are awful. I gave management a detailed accounting of bullying behaviors by one of my less than professional colleagues last week.  This week colleague singled me out again and I stood up to him and informed him that I was reporting his behavior to HR. Management and HR have not had time to meet with me though I have seen emails proving that they are investigating my complaints.

The stress of the compounding behavior of my colleague have taken a toll. I was experiencing panic attack sensations for the past week, but only at work. Yesterday I was only supposed to work three hours but the palpitations and PVCs (I have an underlying heart condition to boot) got so strong I started feeling short of breath and had trouble talking without gasping. I left work after two hours and reported to the walk-in and they transferred me to the ER on oxygen. Three hours and some Ativan later the PVCs were still strong but they released me.  My primary doctor has signed me off work the rest of the week. 

I know I would be unable to function at work and that my avoidance may be what escalates the investigation of harassment in the wworkplace, but I still feel like a failure that even with Buspar and CBT I could not keep from getting so anxious. Tell me I am not the only one who has missed work to get back to a functional baseline.

Besides the fear of causing an accident, I get lost very easily. I probably couldn't tell you directions to save my life or remember directions myself of how to get to a place I've been a dozen times.

I've always been frustrated with myself since it seems so easy for everyone else. Everyone is so excited to get their license at 16, but that sure wasn't me. 

I have a job that affords me the flexibility to work from home or the office, I do most of my shopping online and when I do go out, I'll catch a ride with someone or take public transportation.

I've never given up on driving but just thinking about it sets me on edge.

738,[Relaxing] Finding some solace in alternate spirituality.,"Okay folks, so I'm going out on a limb here.  I know that Reddit is full of people who are very reason-oriented, but I want to stress that I am actually one of those people.  However, I am also human enough to admit that I do feel comfort when exploring my ""spiritual"" side.  

I always expected my anxiety to get better as I aged, like it was some kind of teenager/early adult problem.  I turned 30 this year and I'm managing, but it's definitely always in the background.  Anyway, I have found myself looking for some meaning to help guide my path through all this and I'm finding myself more and more drawn to Native American spirituality.  It shares so many connections with the physical world and doesn't try to explain everything through its narrow dogma.  As someone who strongly believes in focusing on reason and science, I have found a balance here.  

At the end of the day, I can look at things that the Native American traditions have used to explain every day happenings, and while I can say it sounds pretty far fetched, I can relate to the connection with nature and the relationship that the human mind makes with its own habitat.  

This is getting long-winded, so I'll leave this post with something that helps me.  I was going through some really hard times a couple years ago and my anxiety was at its worst.  I was having a really extreme panic attack one night when I heard this strange howling and yipping outside.  I realized that there was a pack of coyotes roaming through the fields near my home, and they sounded like they were having a really great time.  I suddenly felt completely at peace and the sounds they were making really changed me somehow (like I said, I know this is going to sound weird).  Anyway, I was so flabbergasted with how that sound changed something in me that night, so I just started reading about coyotes to learn some things about them.

I learned that the coyote is one of the few creatures to survive in a world that is falling more and more out of balance with man, I learned that they are thriving in situations where they shouldn't be, I learned that they are strong, resilient creatures, and I completely related with them.  I feel so fucking out of place in today's world, but I'm somehow surviving through all of it.  That's when I ran across the totemic explanation of the coyote, which I will let speak for itself:

""Wisdom, Folly

The Coyote teaches you how wisdom and folly
go hand-in-hand.
In the folly of others, we see our own foolishness
and we learn from their mistakes. 

If a Coyote totem has appeared in your life,
be prepared for ""Murphy's Law"" to enter your life with a vengeance.
Your sense of humor will arise full force in keeping with the things happening around you.
Blind dates, things that suddenly don't work, all this is Coyote humor. 
You need to learn to laugh at yourself and Life's irony.

Coyote energy is tied to simplicity and trust.  
It stimulates and renews innocence and reawakens a childlike wisdom in the world.
A Coyote's howl touches your soul, reminding us of our primal connections.

Coyote people are very adaptive to new situations
and have close-knit families, especially when children are involved.""

TL;DR: I find comfort in the ancient beliefs of the Native Americans and eastern shamans-- how does spirituality help you?

741,Seeking willing participants for an anixety zine,"I thought this community might be a good place to seek out willing contributors for an anxiety zine I plan on making. I don't know if this has been done before on here, as I've only recently found out about this subreddit, but it has been tremendously helpful/relatable to me. By getting submissions from people from all over who suffer from anxiety (any kind - formal or informal diagnosis), I'd really make a commitment to complete this zine by the end of the summer. I never thought i'd have the courage to post in here but here I am!

Basically, I'd just like to incorporate experiences, thoughts, perceptions (from others), coping strategies, words of wisdom that have helped you, etc... anything! (you can be creative with it) Negative and positive thoughts/experiences/coping strategies (i.e. I like to bite my lips/the skin around my nails) are all welcome. It can be completely anonymous if desired (I can understand that), or I can sign your name at the end. There are absolutely no limits to what is shared, or how it is shared [i.e. in the form of art, poetry, lists, tips, etc].

Artwork is greatly encouraged! I'll be doing the layout and some of the artwork, but I would really like it if others would like to submit some art :) Perhaps something you've drawn when you were feeling especially anxious, or anything to accompany something you've/someone else has written. Also just art in general to spruce up the zine.

Any ideas that anyone has are greatly welcome and appreciated. Even an overall title for the zine! Simply put, this is a zine for people whose anxiety makes daily living even just a little unbearable - no formal DSM diagnoses required.",18,2012-05-17 02:21:43 EDT-0400

745,A change in meds:  Has this happened to you?,"So I have been taking Wellbutrin for my anxiety now about a couple months.  It helped for a while and then my doctor changed the dose I take from 100mg to 75mg twice a day.

The 100mg seemed like it was starting to wear off in the late afternoon since I took it at night.  SO the reasoning was a lower dose twice a day.

The 3rd, 4th and 5th days after the change were great.  I felt awesome, didnt have any anxiety issues and felt decent.  Since the 6th day (this past thursday) I have been going down hill.  I have been anxious, very disconnected and like I am in a dream like state all the time.  Today has been the worst.  

I felt great this morning until about 2 hours after I took my morning dose.  I was at lunch and I felt horrible.  I had to get groceries with my wife and we went home after.

I got home and went to go take nap.  I tried to sleep my anxiety got the best of me. I got up and started to talk to my wife and just lost it emotionally.

747,I suffer from depression and anxiety because everyone treated me badly and disappointed me since I was a child.,"EDIT* Hello r/Anxiety! I'm a 20 year old College student who's been dealing with anxiety and depression since I was 12. I didn't notice I was so sad when I was younger, but I did notice I started to suffer with anxiety and depression when I hit the age of 14. I went through a lot not knowing what these feelings were and doing nothing but harm to myself and no one wanting to help me go through and everything misunderstanding how I felt and calling me out that I simply want attention. I remember when I was 12 I didn't recognize my behavior as anxiety but realized it after getting out of high school that all that anxiety over getting up a chair and walking because I thought people were going to make fun of my walking, the self mutilation, the bullying, my old journal--were all signs of depression. But at the beginning of High School I struggled more and more as I tried to do my best academically and in sports as well. I remember that it was so hard to wake up the mornings. Sometimes it was so unbareble that I wanted to kill myself because the feeling was too strong. It's so odd that I didn't think it was serious, but when I hit college I realized the anxiety was too much in my life when I saw much it affected my classes. So I decided to get a therapist. 

And this day, was just that day that I was waiting for to see why I was this way.

Today I had a break through with my therapist and realized I am suffering depression and anxiety as an adult because as a child all I faced was disappointment. Everyone around me simply disappointed me. My parents weren't there for me, my brothers and sisters weren't there for me, and had no friends; just people that bullied me. Everyone treated me like shit. My parents constantly beat the shit out of me, my brother and sister would give me a hard time and make fun of me because I was a little chubby, and they would make the neighbor kids chine in. The worst part is that I had no one defend me as a child, and even had the neighbor kid's PARENTS make fun of me for being poor, used clothing, and being chubby. 

Now, as a YOUNG adult I do realize WHY they did it: my parent's marriage was going down, my brother and sister were BOTH rapped, and god knows why the neighborhood kids did this to me. But throughout my life I had people push me around and bully me, and realized throughout the years I have realized that my expectations is mediocre expectations. Because of this socializing has been HELL for me. Talking to people always gets me anxious, and sometimes anxiety creeps on me for no reason and i'm left as an emotional mess the whole day.

My life has improved since currently i'm employed, going to school and decided to attend therapy, but that little girl that has been wanting to cry out why no one was willing to defend her and make her feel that she is a worthy human being is finally coming out. I hate that naturally i'm a pessimistic person. I try so hard to live my life without anxiety creeping in. And I do realize why I am so angry and why I its coming out now.

I'm mad and so sad because just because they were having a hard time with their lives doesn't mean they had to make someone else's life insignificant. Just because your life is feeling shitty doesn't mean you have to go and make my life a living hell too. It wasn't fair. I was a child. I didn't know these problems existed. And I am tired of giving excuses to these people because thanks to them I struggle with the anxiety that a child was never meant to face. 

I'm currently crying typing this. Its just sad to think that I was disappointed by the people around me. I was a child with no one to depend on. And now, its difficult to trust people.

I just want someone to read this, because I can't open up to anyone about this. I don't trust anyone in my life to take what I just said seriously. I mean, this is a legitimate reason to feel this way right? I don't know why I struggle to feel secure about my thoughts and feelings with people, but this is just how I feel. I'm mad because no one bothered to think how I felt in all of this. I'm mad because I could of been a mentally healthy adult. I'm mad because they ruined me psychologically. 

I'm actually a little happy that for the first time I was able to explain my feelings. Most of the times my feelings are bouncing place to place but I think I nailed it. Just too afraid that someone might say i'm full of shit.

Talk to me r/anxiety, is this okay to feel this way? is anyone facing something similar as this?

748,Attention anxious vegetarians (and maybe others),"I've always been a fairly high-strung person, but never experienced full-blown anxiety until I became a vegetarian. A few vitamin supplements brought me back to being functional.

If you are a vegetarian (or think your diet may be contributing to your anxiety), I recommend trying *B complex* (make certain you grab complex) and *flaxseed oil* supplements. I also take a multivitamin to make sure I'm covering all my bases. The B complex seems to be the most important; make sure the label reads ""vegetarian formula,"" though. I experimented with a week on, week off when I started taking the supplements and the difference was dramatic. Around three weeks into taking them daily, I noticed that I could tell I if was late because my anxiety became constrictive.

Fair warning: the niacin in the B complex turns urine neon yellow. Don't freak out.

I am not a medical professional and I don't know how others might react to these supplements. They are all over-the-counter. B vitamins are water-soluble, so you won't OD on them. I expect that they are completely safe, but advise anyone who tries them to pay attention to any changes in their bodies, if only to gauge effectiveness.

**TL;DR:** Try supplementing your diet with **B complex, flaxseed oil, and a daily multivitamin** to possibly reduce anxiety. Stick with it for a week or two. Then, if you're the type to experiment, stop taking them and note the differences. 

I hope this helps! It enabled me to stop hiding.",3,2012-05-17 02:06:21 EDT-0400
749,A little help? New here?,"So, I'm 21 years old. I just graduated from University. During the past month, I've had at least 2 anxiety attacks that were so bad that I thought I was going to die or pass out. I've also had others that felt almost as bad. For instance, yesterday I was driving my girlfriend to my house and felt like I was going to have a panic attack, throw up, or pass out. I also have what seems like all day anxiety. My stomach hurts and I have trouble breathing. Just writing this, I've having trouble breathing. I also get anxious thoughts where I feel like I can see my whole life spinning out of control to the point where I die, go crazy, or turn into an agoraphobic. I've suspected I've had general anxiety for at least 2 years now, but I don't think it has ever been *this* bad before.

Now that I've graduated I'm supposed to go back to my waiter job tomorrow. I've been dreading it all week. I get terrible anxiety just thinking about it. I feel have no internal confidence anymore. I'm petrified about fishing trips I had planned, about vacations far away, job interviews in the city, and even simple sometimes shit like just picking up my gf or going to the mall. 

I have a psychiatrist/therapist. I've been seeing him for 2-3 weeks now and maybe 4 sessions so far. I feel a little better since the day after my last really really bad panic attack but not by much. I've been on the lowest dose of klonopins for about 2-3 weeks (cutting it in half taking it twice daily). It kind of worked the first week, but now I feel like it completely lost its effect. I also have xanax that I take when I feel a panic attack coming on. With this anxiety I feel like I can't do anything anymore and that really scares me. I feel like a different person and I don't like it. I'm thinking of going on Zoloft or some other SSRI but my Doc seems hesitant. I had a fucked up childhood and he thinks talking can fix it. But I don't know, I just don't want this interfering in my life anymore. I like my waiter job, and I might have a huge job opportunity coming up in a month in a far away city (nervous about going there alone). I don't want anxiety to get in the way anymore.

Okay, so I guess here are my questions. (Try not to be too pessimistic. I feel like this board is just the blind leading the blind sometimes. One person having a panic attack freaking out trying to talk to another person freaking out. lol) So here they are: How can I make it through tomorrow? Is that the best way to beat this thing? Just keep breaking my comfort zone even if it means I'll have some really bad panic attacks? Can someone give me confidence, tell me I'm not alone, they beat it, and how? Are meds the answer or can I beat this without it? How hard will that be? Is this just a normal thing I'll go through for a few months that a lot of graduates go through, or will I have this my whole life? How will talk therapy (and only talk therapy) cure me of this?

Edit: In case anyone was wondering about my lifestyle. Living at home with just my dad. Get at least 30 minutes of exercise a day by going to the gym, going for a run, or by playing basketball. Haven't had alcohol in 2 weeks. Haven't had a cigarette in 4 weeks. Haven't had caffeine in 4 weeks. Don't do drugs. ",14,2012-05-16 07:23:45 EDT-0400

I am on a trip, first trip in 2 years because of anxiety, and I suddenly remembered he lived where I was going. I looked him up, I went out for drinks, and asked him about anxiety that I have been working so hard to beat all by myself, and he had me come in and do a number of blood tests, I came back from visiting him again at his office just today, and found out that I a completely healthy, however my jewels weren't givin me the fuels. I ended up taking a shot in the arse, and back in a week. 

He said, and I have read, that its the difference of cleaning your sunglasses. All of a sudden you get more focused, clear, and the rest of your body will function properly.

Sounds great to me, but I never would have thought to check that, even after seeing a normal MD, they just wanted to give me drugs. I guess within 2 weeks my levels should be right, and I hope to report back the effectiveness.

1) I had a complete stranger doing my makeup and seeing every flaw on my face, up close. For someone who has low self-esteem, this was not very pleasant. But the longer it went on the more I realized that we all have things we don't like about our looks, and that I blow my flaws out of proportion. 

2) As a suffer of OCD, I have a lot of strange obsessions. One of the biggest includes a fear of chemicals and somehow accidentally ingesting them. While the very friendly and chatty lady was smearing many types of lotions and cremes all over my face, some got on my lips. It was excruciating at first, but I eventually calmed down and realized it wasn't a big deal! This obsession isn't going to go away very easily, but I think it was a step in the right direction.

3) There were strangers walking around me, while I was at my ""worst,"" so I was exposed to the public. It was uncomfortable, but then I realized they probably don't give a shit about me getting my makeup done. 

It was not easy, and I experienced quite a bit of anxiety at the very beginning, but toward the end I began to calm down some. I am proud of myself! ",15,2012-04-27 01:16:10 EDT-0400

However, I find myself more terrified about the consequences of not getting my shit in order than by the process of getting my shit in order. I still plan on seeing someone about it once I go back to school in the fall, but because I'm terrified of having a life in which my personal goals are not met, I've been able to apply and be accepted for my second bachelor's, and audition for a music program and obtain scholarship.

778,"I don't try my hardest because I'm afraid that if I start progressing toward something better, my anxiety will push me back further or make me give it up. Can anyone else relate?","Hopefully this won't all come out as a jumbled rant, and hopefully someone can understand the same frustration that I do. This issue has been the main thing holding me back and also the cause of many depressive tendencies. 

A quick background history: I'm 21 years old, and have had anxiety for most of my life. It started getting really bad in my junior year of high school, and wasn't fully diagnosed until the beginning of my senior year. I ended up missing a ton of school because of it, and decided to take the noble route of dropping out and acquiring my GED through the local college instead of failing numerous classes, and taking my senior year over again. My anxiety would wax and wane, I would get massive panic attacks out of the blue, and anxious spells that could last a few days. During high school (and continuing after I left), I had a part time job at a local grocery store. There would be periods where I would miss a few days of work due to anxiety, and they didn't take too kindly to that. One week was particularly bad for me, and I ended up missing a ton of work. I started having panic attacks on the job as well and within a few days, I decided to quit. That was two years ago. 

It should be noted that I don't have health insurance, and so seeing a doctor was a matter of money. I saw a few here and there who would prescribe me small amounts of benzos to tide me over, but once those were gone there was nothing I could do. I sought a therapist for a while and did some CBT, but it never really took. 

During the last two years, my anxiety has gotten substantially better. I currently have a 30-pill supply of Ativan which I only use in emergencies (I've only had to take 2 halves in the last 3 months), and my panic attacks are becoming sparser and sparser, as well as less intense. However, there's a slight problem. During these last two years, I haven't really been doing much. I currently work from home doing freelance web design, I still live with my parents, I haven't stepped foot in a college yet, and most of my friends that I used to regularly see have moved away. 

However, I could have a better job, I could be in college, I could have my own place, and I could have a better social life if it wasn't for this damn feeling that I get. I have this extreme fear, this crippling thought process that if I put any time, money, or effort into something and it boosts me in a positive direction, my anxiety will come along and drag me back down to where I was (or worse). Everything that I've worked for, I've had taken away from me. My job, my school, various job and relationship opportunities, friends, meetups, hang outs, plans, all gone. I find fear in getting started with these things, because I'm absolutely afraid of failing. 

I want nothing more than to be in school right now, and working at a job that I enjoy. However I'm terrified that if I get everything together and paid for for school, I'll end up missing classes due to anxiety. Or what if I have a panic attack during a test? Then it'll all be for naught. Same with the job, what if I really enjoy it and it pays really well, but I end up a few months down the line having to quit because my anxiety is too much to bear? 

I know, this is a horribly irrational and destructive thought process, but I just can't shake it. Does anyone share this? Has anyone beaten this, or can give me even a shred of advice? I'd do anything to be in college by next fall, or at least take the first steps and see a guidance counselor for options of how to get in. Interviews with jobs would be awesome too.

784,"[help] The stress is killing me, the depression is allowing it.","To clarify, I posted this on r/Anxiety rather than r/Depression because anxiety is the core reason why I am unable to handle living. I know damn well what depression alone is like, but anxiety came, and then depression mixed in, and it's all kinds of fun. Also, I simply trust the collective mindset of r/Anxiety more than r/Depression when it comes to these things. We are the over-analyzers, after all. Anyway,

The gravity inside of my head is insane. It's like a black hole that steals the light and won't let anything go.

What I really meant was, ""The stress is too much to handle on top of the depression, and I have no place to hide.""

My hugest stressors right now are: Work, anxiety, discomfort (generally speaking), money, medication, sleep (or lack thereof), and it all originates from my god damn head. It seems as if I have no way to deal with it all, no way out, no place to hide, nothing to look forward to. Having been generally stressed and ridden with anxiety that kills my feelings and abilities to function for the duration of my life so far, I'm at the point where I'm about to just leave and say ""fuck it."" Leave everything behind, burn it all, to take everything locked up in my head and fucking unleash it on everyone and everything around me all at once.

There is a minimum of one-hundred reasons why I would be unhappy, but to sum it up, it's the lack of happiness throughout life so far that is leaving me feeling so ripped off and convinced that it will not get better soon enough to stop me from giving in or giving up.

So, I have three options:

1: Keep Trying

As I have been for years, NON-STOP. I have received no result as of yet. I have not become better, or, at least, not enough to give me a reason to think that trying to become better actually leads to becoming better. The process is simply too inefficient and takes too long, and I'm much too impatient to put up with it. It's kind of like if I would just quit trying, I could finally fall to where I'm supposed to, to be in my place. If I would quit holding myself up, I'd fall into the fire or the sea or whatever place. But just ""letting go"" right now can take minimal effort compared to how much effort I put into keeping myself alive. So, point 2:

2: Give In

Hospitalize myself. Put myself in a place where I have no choice but to be fixed. The place where I belong. I'm talking mental hospital, here, but probably a ""real"" hospital to start out. This way, I probably throw away the things that I still own and the ""friends"" that I still have. At least, that's how I feel it is. I throw it all away and get to stand there and watch it all burn. Strangely, I think that would be satisfying. Little effort, guaranteed result.

3: Give Up

Given my current situation, there is actually a way in which I may be able to very easily kill myself. A way that will probably happen unless I lift a finger to prevent it. And probably within a couple of weeks from now. This reality has become very possible in my mind, and I've actually grown to be disgusted by all of the things that I own, thinking that there's no point in having all of these useless damn decorations and clothes and everything else because I won't be alive to even see it. Hence why I took some old belongings and burnt them last week. I just wanted to kill away the memories, and I felt a legitimate smile, watching it burn. It felt like one of the few things I would actually remember.

If there's a fourth option to be here, I'm open to suggestions. I haven't decided on one yet, but option one has been playing on repeat for years and years and I just want to hit the goddamn stop button. I just want it to stop. Just make it stop.

tl;dr: I'm unhappy with what I have been through so far and I want it to stop or change, now. What do I do?",5,2012-04-27 14:27:28 EDT-0400

786,"Passionflower and Teas for Anxiety, My Personal Experience","Hey guys, I wanted to make this post in case anyone else was wondering about the effectivness of Passionflower for Anxiety. I also wanted to throw in some other stuff about teas that I have found to be effective. I am going to try to make this as short but detailed as possible. 

So a little over a month ago I decided to try out Passionflower and see if it worked for me and my anxiety. I decided to do this based on information from other reddit suggestions in the past and random reading I had been doing. It seemed to have at least some scientific basis for its anxiety-reducing benefits. 

Source: [Study] http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11679026

Anyway I bought these: [Amazon]http://www.amazon.com/Natures-Answer-Passionflower-Standardized-60-Count/dp/B000I48M3A/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1335225158&sr=8-1

and took them as directed, 2 capsules a day. I took one in the morning (when my anxiety is the worst) and one mid-day. I don't know if it was a placebo effet or if it did in fact work. All I can say is it definetly FELT like it worked. I had almost the exact same feeling as Xanax minus the drunk-like feeling and not near as much drowsiness. I am only on .5mg of Xanax as needed though, and have only taken it 2 times in the last 4 months, just an FYI. 

Any day I woke up anxious during this last month I would take a capsule and it seemed to work everytime. If it didn't completely eliminate my anxiety, it made it very manageable. Of course I still keep a spare Xanax in my wallet in case I ever get a terrible panic attack. Passionflower just worked wonderfully for me.

During this same time, I started to experiment with teas. My mom is a HUGE tea drinker and has buttloads of different teas at her house. She was showing me some that had been recommended to her a long time ago when she was suffering from anxiety/depression too. 

It was these in particular: 

[Mix Blossoms Tea]http://www.botanic-art.com/anahuac-blossoms-bags-pi-224.html

[7 Blossoms Tea]http://www.mexicanimports.us/images/thumbs/0000345_300.jpeg

After looking at both of them, I kind of said, ""Wow no wonder"". BOTH teas have Passionflower in them and the mixed blossoms tea has Valerian Root, another scientfically proven herb to reduce anxiety. I was lucky enough to find more at local hispanic stores.

I combined this with my now routine, twice daily, Passionflower pills and WOW. I sleep like a freaking baby now. I'll drink a tea 30mins-1hr before bed an it knocks me out. I get such a good nights sleep without feeling anxious during the time it takes me to actually fall asleep.  

So to recap my routine goes like this: 

*1 Passionflower Capsule in the morning if I feel anxious.
*Another one mid-day. 
*Either one of these teas before bed. 

I highly suggest giving this or something like this a shot if you are a new anxiety sufferer (like me) and don't know in which direction to go yet. IE: Medication, CBT, or both. Or maybe you want to try to fight off anxiety yourself and need something asap. I personally want to get rid of my anxiety ASAP (or make it more mangeable) thus I am starting CBT next friday and will continue to do this routine to help facilitate the whole process. If needed though I will incorporate actual anxiety meds but im currently optimistic that Passionflower and CBT will help me overcome anxiety. 

**NEEDLESS TO SAY**, DO NOT take with any other anxiety meds without talking to your doctor first. I haven't taken my Xanax once since starting with the Passionflower since I have not had a chance to ask our family doctor yet. That and also because I haven't needed it =D. 

Good luck everyone! ",4,2012-04-24 04:47:00 EDT-0400

Most people look at me and assume that I am a confident person. I would much rather go an entire day at school without talking to anyone than have to talk. I wish I could be as outgoing as the rest of the world sometimes, but I just can't make myself do that. I'm afraid that I offend people sometimes, or make them think that I don't like them because I don't talk to them or look away when we pass in the hallway. In truth, i am afraid to talk to them. I have never had a girlfriend or really even talked to girls because I'm too afraid that they will see that I really like them and not feel the same way. That's the worst part. Im just afraid to get too close to people. Whenever it appears that we are growing closer, whether its a girl or a friend or anyone else, I have a tendency to push them away. I have a group of friends that I hang out with, and I feel comfortable talking to them but even then I feel awkward sometimes and I'm not sure that they realize why I don't say ""hi"" to them sometimes when I see them. I do spend time with girls, but it is always with at least one other friend who I let do all the talking. I'm sure the girls must think I'm really weird but whatever. I even have trouble talking to my teammates. They might say something to me and I respond in a really awkward way or without looking at them. 
I hate when people being up that I don't talk much or am quiet.
I just wish people understood how I feel, but I'm just so different from everybody.
I don't know why I wrote this post or if anyone will see it or take the time to read it but I guess it's just good to vent for once. Maybe you guys know how I feel.

EDIT: Thanks to everyone who took the time to read this post, and especially those who commented. It means a lot.",5,2012-04-24 17:33:41 EDT-0400

793,"Something crossed my mind today, that may help some of you.","I was walking around my neighborhood today, in contemplation, and something ridiculously obvious crossed my mind. Something that I had thought about before, but never really appreciated because it seems like such a ""duh"" kind of thing. Before I developed my anxiety, the thing that I'm afraid of NEVER happened to me. I never even thought about it. But now I live in fear. So it's important to rationalize the improbability of your fears. The next logical step is to address the thing you're REALLY afraid of, a panic attack/your ability to handle your emotions. This can be helped with cognitive behavioral therapy, as most of you know.

I realize this is a bit of obvious advice and won't do much for most of you, since the complexities of your anxiety are each unique, and thus hard to deal with. But if one person here can be better of because of this advice, it's worth posting imo.",2,2012-04-24 06:54:46 EDT-0400

795,I've been having a panic attack now for almost a week straight. ,"I feel like my chest was tight. I was actually questioning whether it was a heart attack. I've been shaking like an addict on withdrawal. I am taking my meds like I'm supposed to, as prescribed. Every noise makes me jump, literally. My husband, coming upstairs to bed, scares the crap out of me. I'm so anxious, I can't even focus on getting anything done in the house. I've been thinking about knives all damn week. But, I won't hurt myself. I keep saying that because I don't want to hurt my husband. I'm scared, jittery, and very, very tired. Just ranting, I'm sorry.

EDIT: So, it's Saturday, and I'm still having a panic attack. I'm avoiding caffeine and sugar as much as possible. I talked to my husband, and he told me to call my shrink first thing Monday morning. I really appreciate all of the help and encouragement I've been given.


UPDATE: Well, after almost 2 weeks solid of a panic attack, I finally heard from my psyche. Hecalled today, and said to reduce my Bupropion to 300mg, and my Lithium to 300mg. He said to do that until I see him, on May 18th. But, if I have any more trouble, I'm supposed to call him. We shall see. Wish me luck!

796,Any students that have a crushing sense of humiliation every time they speak in class?  Every time I speak I have a mild panic attack and can't stand people looking at me  [x-post from /r/depression],"I'm currently a graduate student in the humanities. I've been in the program for one year and have been suicidal and depressed with intense anxiety for the whole time.


I can't sleep days before class or when I have a lot of work to do. I can't concentrate on the reading because I start thinking about what I should say in class and start to get anxious. Then when I am in class, I feel this crushing sense of humiliation after everything I say. Sometimes I have to fight back tears. I'm seeing a therapist and have been trying to do yoga and meditation to get my thoughts to stop running. It has helped me stay afloat, but I still feel humiliated every single day. I still get panicky every time I talk. I just started Lexapro so we'll see if that helps.


I moved from very far away and I don't have any friends here, so that doesn't help. I also moved here with my boyfriend and we are having problems because of all the stress issues I'm having. I'm stuck here for the time being and have to at least complete next year which involves teaching, of which I'm dreading.


I just wanted to see if there were any other students Redditors that are experiencing similar problems, how they are dealing, etc. Or just to commiserate because I just really want to talk to someone and I have no one I can talk to right now. Usually I come home from class and cry myself to sleep which increases the anxiety the next day.  I need to stop that behavior and I'm trying to stay optimistic and social.

797,Mini panic attack trying to sleep?,"My panic attacks started about a month or two ago and I have been trying to manage them on my own (I pretty broke, so I can't afford to go see a psychologist and have no insurance). And I think I have been doing better since they started, only 2-3 attacks and that was when they first started. But since then I have been able to keep them away (now its usually a lingering thing at the back of my mind to remind me to be on guard). 

Now my attacks are about having a heart attack. And recently (past week) when I try to go to sleep, right before I feel that last part of my conscious fall asleep, I am suddenly jolted (I literally shoot up out of bed) awake by a big wave of panic that feels like it emanated from my heart. It only lasts for a second, but it scares the fuck out of me. Now when it first happened it was a big one, and I was afraid to sleep again. Then they were only less intense ones, and I sorta got use to them (more of an annoyance than scary). And then I pretty much figured out how to no have them happen at all.

But just before I wrote this I had another big one like the first. And now I am asking if anyone else has this problem and has advice on how to get over this?

**EDIT:** Just realizing that it trigger an actual panic attack. Much different than my first once. Those lasted for hours, this one I think just peaked after 15min

**EDIT 2:** Would buying sleeping pills work? I know you don't need a prescription for some of them and they can be inexpensive. Knock me out before fear can build up and burst out right before I fall asleep?

798,[Help] Going to see a psychiatrist,[deleted],6,2012-04-28 05:23:26 EDT-0400
799,[rant] I'm sick of it all,"I apologise in advance, I'm feeling a little sorry for myself today.

I'm totally and utterly sick of anxiety.

I feel sick to my stomach with worry about the future. It's draining the colour from my life into a big black hole of depression. WHY WON'T IT GO AWAY?

I'm a medical student; typical high achiever, type-A personality. I was always a confident person, out-going and always up for a challenge. Nowadays a challenge is staying in a room with 8 other people for 1 hour. I can't believe how much I have fallen.

I used to play lead guitar in a rock band, I travelled and lived in a different country by myself. I applied for medical school, went to four interviews, got accepted into my top choice, and FINALLY for the first time in my life I feel like I am doing something that I genuinely LOVE, I'm struck down with this piece-of-shit affliction. 

Everyday feels like a struggle. Thoughts of tomorrow bring genuine fear. I don't know when it will end and I'm struggling to see a light at the end of the tunnel. I'm normally very positive. Last week I had a good week (my best in months) but today I don't feel like anything has changed. It teases me; I get little glimpses of the old confident me, before this worthless, nervous, shell of my former self retakes its mantle in my anxiety-stricken day-to-day existence. 

I don't understand it! I genuinely went into medicine hoping for a better life for myself and hopefully a chance to make a difference in other peoples' lives too. And this is messing it up.

Fear and dread seem to be the default emotions when I think of my timetable tomorrow. A 1 hour class that I'm terrified of. I've had this class almost 100 times in my 2 years of medical school and over the past few months my anxiety has decided to manifest a fear towards it boarding on phobic proportions.

It makes no sense.

I had difficulties in my life a few years back. I had a friend die, a suicide in my extended family, and a couple more deaths all in the space of 6 months or so. I was okay being back at school this year until I got another phone call from home informing me of someone else's death in a car accident. Could this be causing it?

I've been to counselling but it didn't seem to help very much. I feel like I'm rearranging deckchairs on the titanic. It's something that I don't feel in control of. It's controlling me. The mind is a terrible master.

I desperately want to feel normal again. I want to feel normal nerves as I would have done before and not this pathological sense of fear and dread at seemingly mundane situations. It's not normal and it's eating away at me from the inside. I've done okay so far to bottle it up and keep a handle on it but I'm not sure how much longer I can do it. 

I'm terrified that it'll get in the way of my dream of becoming a doctor. I'm terrified that if it does, I may never recover. I'm terrified of wasting my family's money to put me through school. I'm terrified that something so seemingly small as 'nerves' is gonna get the best of me.

I honestly don't know what to do about it anymore. It's making me feel like I have to pee all the time and now I can hardly go anywhere without worrying about going to the toilet. I can't sit in class without the constant worrisome dread that I'm gonna piss myself. How I have fallen. And it's so depressing.

I've exams coming up soon and I've no idea how I'm gonna get though it.     

Edit: I also want to say for anyone reading this and is interested in the development of the anxiety that I had a direct trigger for the return of my anxiety this year (I had a little in my first year, but nothing near as bad as this year). I received a phone call from home informing me of a death of a family friend in a car accident, and the next day in class, *BOOM*, I had a very large anxiety attack. 

This seemed to manifest in the sensation of having to urinate. Very, very badly. Basically, I thought I was gonna piss myself in class, ridiculous as that sounds. Watching this from the perspective as a medical student, I find the whole thing interesting, but, holy hell, it's annoying as hell. At its worst it has the potential to be very crippling but I'm fighting though as best I can. I do get tired though.",14,2012-04-23 16:44:07 EDT-0400

803,Just got prescribed Celexa. I feel like a failure and Im scared to take it. Any advice would help.,"Short backstory. Im 20 years old, starting University and have had mild-moderate anxiety since I was 14.

I never thought Id be prescribed medication since my anxiety symptoms are only really bad when Im trying to make friends or get to know people on a personal level. Going to University has my anxiety pretty managable as long as I didnt talk to anyone but I didnt want to have a lonely University expierence and opted in to try some meds to relieve some social anxiety and get to know people and make friends. Well I went to my gp and he prescribed me celexa and now Im scared t take it. Im afraid of the side effects getting in the way of my school work and grades. Another fear I have is that the anxiety will change who I am and when I eventually stop taking them I will revert to the old me and people will start to hate me. I also feel like Ive failed but I think a large part of that thought process is because I have a slight taboo of medication. Any one have a similar experience to mine?

806,Can't Make Friends ,"I don't know why, but making friends is the hardest thing I've ever tried to do. College just started and I tried talking to some people but we either only say a couple things or they walk away and talk to someone else. My desire for a friend is so severe; wherever I go, I look at everyone and wonder how I could make friends with them, and I get jealous when I see a group of people walking together. 

I don't want to seem too desperate, so when I talk to people I try not to ask too many questions and just act cool. Or I just don't talk to anyone at all and wait for people to talk to me which never happens. 

I cry hard at least once a week. Yesterday I cried when I was walking to my car at my college (it was at night and not many others were around). I also cried in the shower later. 

What kills me is for SOME reason, I'm terrified of people thinking that I'm a loner or desperate for friends, so I try to act like I have a social life..... even to my family, I'll lie and say I'm meeting up with people when really I just go to the bookstore or something by myself. 

Once or twice, I've gotten to the point where I talk to a certain person in my class every day, but before I know it, the semester is over and we never talk to each other again. So getting to the first part is hard, but staying in contact with people seems impossible. 

Any advice, or people with the same problem? :(",7,2012-01-19 08:14:13 EST-0500
807,Social anxiety?? I'm sick of avoiding people,"I think I might have social anxiety and dont know what to do about it. 

Basically, I get nervous about how people perceive me. I will avoid calling people I dont know, talking to people in my classes etc. My coworkers will invite me to go hang out with them, but I'll usually feel a strange aversion to hanging out with them and make up some excuse to get out of it. I'm always extremely quiet and awkward the first few times I talk to new people because I can never seem to think of things to say that I dont think will make me sound stupid. (though eventually I'll open up and feel like I can be myself) 

This feeling of not being able to open up to people has led to a lot of fights with people I've dated because they feel like I'm avoiding them, when in reality, I was just anxious about talking to them. 

Even now, I'm typing this alone in the university library because, for no apparent reason, I dont feel like going home and hanging out with my friends there. 

This has never really bothered me before, I was content to be the quiet loner with a few close friends, but lately I have gotten sick of it. I recently realized that, after 4 years in college, I haven't really made friends with anyone in any of my classes, and have become somewhat withdrawn from some of my good friends lately. I hate being this way. I want to get myself out there, make more connections and be the person I want to be.

Does anyone have any advice as to how I can overcome/deal with this? I'm tempted to go to a doc about it, but am apprehensive about looking inferior to him, my friends and my family. (Talk about a vicious cycle!) 

Sorry to rant, but I'm sick of not living up to my full social potential. ",4,2012-01-20 06:36:32 EST-0500
808,How do you deal with the hopelessness?,"Hi.
I'm trying to deal with my anxiety and it feels like I'm steadily making progress, especially lately, but I still have these periods of just pure hopelessness, where I feel like it won't get better. I'm having a hard time explaining this, but I'm sure a lot of you know what I'm talking about. Even though I usually have a pretty positive attitude about it now and I'm working on it, there are just those bad days where I don't feel like doing anything.

812,Feeling like I'm going crazy? Also help with obsessiveness? ,"I've always been an anxious person, but about a year ago I tried k2, thinking it was marijuana, and I had a bad trip.  Then I tried marijuana a few weeks later and had a bad anxiety attack.  I didn't get the attack when I was high, but when I was high, I was extremely spacy and my heart rate was very high.  I thought I was having another bad trip.  So after a week and the effects weren't wearing off, I finally had a panic attack, thinking I was losing my mind.  

I sent myself to a hospital and was on anti depressants and anti psychotics for several months, since I told them I thought I was psychotic, since I had read about the symptoms online...

Now I'm not taking any medication or anything but I still have some concerns.  Aftyer reading so much into mental illnesses like schizophrenia I'm constantly worried that I'm going to get them.  Sometimes I feel like I'm going to lose control or space out again and it's rather uncomfortable.  

Also, when I look at the sky or a bright screen I can see small bright dots flitting in and out of my vision, like eye floaters but smaller.  Also small flashes of light as well.  

Onto the next topic, my obsession.  I've always been obsessive but it was never really a problem until I got into my first relationship.  I was a christian and my gf was agnostic.  I read a verse that said 'do not be unequally yoked with unbelievers' and I could not get it out of my head.  I tried not to think about it but it kept cropping up and it made my life hell.  I would lay awake at night with worry, questioning everything about the verse.  I read it over and over and analyzed it over and over, read so many different interpretations and I just couldn't get it out of my head.  So I broke up with her...

But then I started obsessing more over religion.  I renounced christianity because I always had my doubts and this pushed me.  However then I started thinking about islam, and the same thing happened.  I didn't want to be a muslim, still don't.  But the idea of it I can't stop thinking about.  I'm constantly obsessing over things I always loved, wondering if I can be happy when doing them, if perhaps they are sinful or something and I just can't stop obsessing.

816,My hair has ruined my social life.,"Hello. I am sorry if I get a little sloppy writing this, I have so many things to say. I'll try to keep it organized. (Also, I am 14. Please don't judge me for my age, I am not dumb. I was actually extremely nervous to post my age due to the fact teenagers are stereotyped a lot. lease don't make me regret it).

I am a male who has not had a haircut for years. My hair is down past my shoulders, and I hate it. The issue is, because of my hair, I have always been seen as ""that weird guy"", and I started avoiding people in order to avoid a potential rude comment about my hair. Now, I rarely go out in public, and if I do I actually start shaking and avoiding eye contact or talking.

So, why don't I just get my hair cut? Because I cannot go out in public without having a breakdown. Even being near people I don't know makes me shake. Having them watch me get a haircut, and one touching me would probably make me black out. 

My life has been so routine that I don't even know what I'm doing most of the time. I am constantly thinking, endlessly creating fantasies where I have friends, have a life, and maybe even a girlfriend. I hate not being aware. I always feel out of it.

My grades started dropping in 6th grade, my hair was already long then, but almost all my friends from elementary went to a separate school due to location. I had made some friends, but not many. I tried to find out why my grades were dropping, keep in mind I was not being bullied so I was pretty sure it was some type of focus issue.

Then, during the winter break, I had a breakdown. I couldn't go back to school. I was sweating every time I thought about going back. After many long talks with my parents, I ended up getting homeschooled. I do not like being homeschooled, but I need an education, and when I have the choice of getting bad grades at a public school, or better grades at home, I chose the latter. And I have been getting good grades, but I feel even more isolated from society now then before, because I am.

About a year ago, I started wondering what I would look like without long hair, because I am very unattractive with my current hair. I took my hoodie, tucked my hair away so only the ends would show on my forehead, and I was shocked. I actually look good! When my parents were not home, I started having 1-2 hour long periods in the bathroom where I would just admire this new found me. (I still do).

I think I thought of this new me as another person, and thought of him as a friend. Yes, I became my own friend. Eventually I even started having my short haired self try to talk some sense into my long haired self. I was arguing in the mirror with myself, trying to get myself to see how logical it is to get a haircut, but my mind seems to just hit a roadblock every time, and I would start thinking about what I would change if I could go back in time, which is ridiculous.

I hate change. That is another reason I feel I can't get a haircut. I don't like being the center of attention, and a change like a haircut for me would be very hard to cope with. I also want to go back to school, but if I get a haircut and go, I can't even imagine the people I used to know's reactions, who have only known me with long hair.

I feel desperate. I have even, and this is going to sound pathetic because it is, though of faking an injury to my head so I could maybe pretend I didn't know who I was and cut off my hair, then magically go back to normal.

I have never done drugs, I live in a good area, and my parents are together. I feel selfish a lot of the time, making others worry about me because I'm afraid to get a haircut.

Also, **please** do not tell me to suck it up and go. The last time  went to the dentist, I had been sweating so much there was a spot on the waiting room chair, and no one was in the waiting room other then my mom and a lady reading a magazine. I honestly think if I try going into a crowded Greatclips I will faint, or run away halfway through the haircut.

I've been to therapy, but it didn't help at all. If anything, it made me worse. I am not depressed though. I love life, the mere thought of ending it is ridiculous. I also have never cut myself, Loosing valuable plasma is not going to help me in any way.

Why do I refuse to get a haircut, even after all of this?

824,Method for Dealing with Panic Attacks,"Since this is such a commonly asked question, and this method worked wonders for me, I wanted to share it with everyone. 

My therapist gave me a great way to handle anxiety attacks, but it definitely takes a little practice before it's completely effective, as you really have to concentrate.

When you feel that tightening in your chest, pick an object and stare at it. Any object, I've found that plants work best, so I'll use that as an example. Now, without touching it, just consider it for a moment. Start to imagine how the plant would feel if you were holding it in your hand. Is it in a pot? How would the pot feel? How heavy do you think if it was in your hands right that moment? Now, how would the rest of the plant feel? Does it have flowers? How delicate are the petals? Continue until you have mentally ""felt"" the plant entirely.

Then, hit every other sense. How would it smell if you were far away? Closer? If you rustled the petals/leaves, what would it sound like? If you put a piece in your mouth, how would it taste? Bitter? Sweet?

At that point, you should be completely distracted from whatever anxiety you had before. Usually, the taste part makes me laugh a bit too.

Like I said, this takes practice- it won't work perfectly the first time you try. You'll get better at it with every time you need it, and feel free to practice it even when you aren't anxious- it'll make you better for when the time comes. Until then, keep paper bags everywhere, as that's the great scientific way of stopping those attacks :)

This happens with me when I let everything building up and building up and it seems like you have the weight of the world on top of you. I get stressed about something little and it turns fearing my boyfriend dumping me and my mom dying and it snowballs. You have to try to stop yourself. Tell yourself (out loud if need be) that those connections are ONLY IN YOUR MIND and are not going to come to fruition. With practice, you'll stop making those connections and will be able to make your anxiety a lot smaller.

827,"Any people extroverted by heart, but because of anxiety introverted? ","So as as  kid I used to be very extroverted, although deep down I had a primitive version of anxiety. Small physiological responses such as chest palpitations, an inner feeling of dread and over-thinking things in a  way that was uncommon for children of my age. As I grew older my anxiety grew and manifested itself in new forms. I became increasingly reclusive and spent a lot of my preteen years playing halo on xbox live. But at the same time I love socializing, once I get to the party or meetup with my friends I get a ""high"" of it. I enjoy being around other people, and come home with a happy feeling. The problem is the next day I feel really anxious about it and have trouble socializing again for a few days, and when I finally agree to meet up with my friends, I have this overwhelming feeling of dread. As I walk or commute to the agreed meetup location, I have a subconcious feeling or ""back of the head feelng"" of anxiety that nothing I can say to my self can make subside. This feeling only reaches its peak when I say hello to my friends and doesn't go away until at least 30 mins into socializing.

830,Started meds last week!,"I can not remember a day in my life without anxiety. Being 32 years old and fed up with pushing all my friends away due to social anxiety until I am depressed and lonely; I finally got the courage to take the plunge and go to the doctor. Wow what a difference and it has been only a week. Today I went into a mobile phone store because I had a problem with my phone. I have been avoiding doing this for a year because I knew every time i go in there I have a full blown anxiety attack. It is terribly difficult to communicate your needs to someone when your heart is pounding, hands are trembling and your sweating like mad. I can't make eye contact  and I feel incredibly ashamed of myself. Today when I went in nothing happened. I was able to make eye contact, smile and even cracked a joke! Wow my life is changed.
I am new to all this... has anyone been able to stop taking meds and still feel this way?",19,2012-09-16 02:42:06 EDT-0400
831,A People Pleaser,"I used to be a people pleaser.  It mattered more that people like me.  It mattered more than a lot of things.  It mattered so much that not only did I let people walk all over me, but after the fact I still wanted to be liked by them.  I would sacrifice things I wanted.  I would do things their way even when I had another idea in mind.  I put myself second.

Now, however, I've turned off my people pleasing personality unless I'm with someone I really love and really care about.  I save that part of me for the people who deserve it.

Today I was put in a situation where I had to make a choice, I did not know how the person would react to my decision and I had two choices.  Do what they would have wanted and make them happy while I was not.  Or - do what I wanted to make me happy, and leave them unhappy.

The old me would have not given it a second thought, and made the choice that would please the other person.

Instead, I went ahead and made the choice I wanted. 

That person isn't happy... but it won't kill them!  And nothing bad happened to me due to putting myself first.

I wanted to share this as I'm sure there are a lot of people in here that live life to please others.  I missed out on a lot by caring more about pleasing others than myself.  But no longer - and today I got to reap the benefits.  I hope some day you can too.

834,[Positive rant] Realization during cognitive behavioural therapy session,"Just had a session in which I was required to talk to a few people about something, to help me get over my social anxiety, and afterwards we were discussing the causes of my anxiety.

I know it's illogical to be anxious about other people's impressions of me, and that I don't (or shouldn't) care what people I don't even know think of me, and then I realised that that wasn't the source of the fear.

I'm not scared of someone thinking that I'm a nervous or pathetic individual, or judging me badly, but what I am scared of is the idea that their judgement could be right. (Which is obviously stupid.)

I think I've watched too much TV. You see these characters with their whole persona and life story displayed on their face, in their body language, and how people react to them. Maybe if I'm coming across as an anxious, pathetic person to other people in real life then that will define who I am as a person.

I need to realize that we're not shallow characters on TV, and what other people think of me doesn't matter not just because I don't need to care what they think, but because even if they do judge me badly that doesn't define me as a person.

I just thought of this and it made me feel great, can anyone else relate to similar fear or realization?

Also it's worth mentioning that while part of me thinks I don't care what everyone thinks, it's important not to care that you actually do care a bit what people think of you. (If I *actually* didn't care what other people thought I'd would walk around in PJs and wash once a week.)",13,2012-09-18 20:53:55 EDT-0400

836,Thought I'd share my story and remind others that it does get better.,"I've been thinking about writing this post up for some time, but I never felt that I was quite ready to write a retrospective on my time spent with anxiety. Now, however, I feel that I've reached a point of sufficient stability that such a retrospective is appropriate.

The basic goal of this post is to remind people who are currently struggling with anxiety that things *can* and *will* get better. Your path may be more or less difficult than mine was (and is!), but it is a path which will eventually see you leading a more full life than you are now. Don't succumb to your anxiety, even if it feels insurmountable. 

Anxiety entered my life when I was just starting my second year of university. I had experienced bouts of anxiety throughout my life, but had never experienced a panic attack or anything severe enough to indicate anything more than a slightly nervous disposition. Therapists would later try to find roots of my fully-blossomed anxiety in my childhood, seeking some sort of unprocessed trauma, but there was nothing to be found. To this day, I remain convinced that I simply experienced a change in my brain chemistry that had rather severe implications for how I would live my life for the next several years.

The first panic attack hit when I was out for a walk. For the previous few days I'd had a rather nasty cold, and I was still congested. Walking usually helps my sinuses clear, so I went out for a brisk walk. My first indication that something was wrong came when I realized that my heart was beating very quickly, and that I was sweatier than I should have been. I started to feel afraid. Suddenly, my body shifted into overdrive. Every nerve from my toes through the top of my head felt like it was buzzing at full strength. This, combined with the still-lingering illness, was too much, and I started to pass out. I put my head between my knees, and the world came back enough that I was able to call one of my roommates, who came to get me.

That was the first panic attack that I had. For the next four hours, I lay in bed wondering what on earth had happened to me, occasionally getting bursts of dizziness and the same sizzling feeling in my nerves. I didn't know whether I had some kind of neurological problem or not, whether or not I had experienced some kind of cardiac event, or whether it was just low blood sugar. I was terrified. 

From then on, I was perpetually nervous about having a similar attack. I noticed patterns in when the attacks would come: typically when I was alone and traveling between my house and university, or while alone at work. I also noticed that, for reasons unknown to me at that time, if I called my parents or girlfriend and spoke with them for a minute, the attack would subside. I started to exhibit what would become entrenched patterns of avoidance of the trigger scenarios - I avoided being alone, I avoided public transit, I took shifts that coincided with those of my coworkers. My girlfriend and parents started getting two or three calls a day from me, for no particular reason - I hadn't yet told anyone about the attacks.

Eventually, I acknowledged that something was wrong, but I still had no idea what. I went to my doctor, who ordered a battery of tests - blood tests, ECG, and so on. All of them came back completely normal. The attacks still persisted. Then I ran into a description of the symptoms of a panic attack online, and felt that sense of dawning realization. Every one of my symptoms appeared on the list, and the triggers for the attacks were mentioned as common triggers for panic attacks.

At this point, I felt somewhat better - I knew, at least, that I wasn't experiencing the symptoms of some horrible heart defect. But foolishly, I did not seek any treatment. I thought I could deal with it on my own.

Over the next two years, the attacks worsened. I broke up with my girlfriend and moved back in with my parents. I started to fear the times when I knew I wouldn't be able to get in contact with someone on the phone, because if I had a panic attack I wouldn't be able to stop it. This worrying made me anxious, and this anxiety made panic attacks more frequent and severe. Previously talkative in class, I became more withdrawn. I still spoke up, but it required a conscious effort, and frequently after speaking up I would need to get a glass of water to calm myself down. I was having between two and three panic attacks of moderate strength per day. Still, I didn't pursue any treatment.

Then, at the start of the second semester of my last year of undergrad, shit hit the fan. It was a Thursday. I left the house at 12:04 to walk to the bus stop. My mom was on the phone with a friend in Ontario. At 12:12 I got to the bus stop, already feeling somewhat anxious - I knew that I wouldn't be able to contact my mom if I had a panic attack. At 12:15 the bus arrived, and I got on. Immediately, I felt even more uneasy. But I persevered, and took my seat. The bus I was on passes through an area which has no cell phone signal just before it reaches the university. At 12:19, the bus stopped in this area to let off a nun. I looked at her as she got off, and checked my phone. 12:19, no cell signal. Immediately a severe panic attack hit. I felt like I was being hit by a train. I was dizzy, sweating, my heart was pounding. I needed to *run*, but I couldn't. The attack lasted for half an hour, and only subsided when I took a cab home.

Finally, I sought treatment. However, the attack had been severe enough that I now was psychologically incapable of being alone for any period of time, or of taking the bus on my own. If I was, I would have a panic attack. Fear took over my life. Despite weekly therapy sessions, I was more or less unable to attend class. This caused academic complications for me that I'm still sorting out. 

Flash forward eight months. I'm living in my own apartment in a different city from my family and fiancee, I'm in graduate school, and I teach three tutorials a week. When I go home to visit, I take public transit and the ferry alone. None of this bothers me anymore. The panic attacks are under control (touch wood!) - in fact, they simply do not occur anymore (again, touch wood!). How, you might wonder, did this happen?

- **Cognitive behavioural therapy**

- **The right medication**

- **Support from those close to me**

I cannot stress enough the importance of these. CBT is one of the more difficult things that I've done, but it was immensely helpful. I still use the techniques I learned when I'm feeling anxious or nervous about, for example, giving a lecture. The medication is also immensely helpful. I don't take much (75mg of Effexor daily), but it provides me enough of a leg up that the CBT techniques can really be effective. Without CBT or medication, I would not be where I am today.

The support from others is also of great importance. What I have found is that the hardest step for me was being open and honest about the problems that I was facing - once I told the people I trusted about my anxiety, they were happy to help me, and their support made an immense difference. I spent a long time trying to hide my anxiety and pretend that I was okay, but bottling it up did me no good whatsoever. Letting a trusted few know about it and telling them how they could help me was one of the key steps on the road to winning my life back. 

I don't think that I've ""conquered"" anxiety by any stretch of the imagination. There will be times in my life when it crops up again, in times of stress or illness. But I have my life back now. And if you are experiencing anxiety and feeling lost at sea, remember: *it will be okay. Both now and in the long term, you will be alright. In the short term, the fear that you have will subside. In the long term, you will learn how to work with and disarm that fear, and you will be free to live your life the way you want to again.*",5,2012-09-20 10:17:00 EDT-0400

838,How do I stop worrying about everything?,"M 19. I post a lot on /r/depression and maybe this should go there, but I think this belongs here.

I've been depressed for a couple months as a result of years of anxiety; social situations, school, dying, women (never even kissed a girl, only told my best friend that I love her didn't work) you name it I worry about it and probably failed at it. 

A few days ago my friends addressed this depression and gave me an intervention. It felt so good to see that I'm surrounded by people who love me when I felt so alone (even though I had a lot anxiety the whole time). I knew I had friends but seeing it is so much more real, but every time I think about them I start to cry and worry. I'm so happy and it feels like it could go away so easily. 

I visited an old friend of mine and had a great time, but these ideas kept creeping in that his family would be murdered or that he would die overseas (he joined the army since I last saw him and it scared the shit out of me). I was glad I cut our time short because I couldn't hold the tears back much longer.

I feel haunted; I always worry and imagine the worst case scenario happening to me or the people I love and usually I assume that whatever's going to happen it's my fault. I think the more I grow and develop the more horrible the things I can imagine and feel. It's especially bad when I'm alone with my thoughts; I can't stand trying to fall asleep at night or taking a shower or just anytime where I'm alone and not distracted somehow; sometimes I can occupy my thoughts, but not as much anymore. 

I always feel guilty even though I usually do the right thing; I'm as good as any person can be, but I don't feel that way. I used to smoke a lot of pot and I still do, but I just don't have as much since this whole depression thing started. Maybe that's what was holding me together because my anxiety meds don't seem to really do anything.

I never feel good enough try my best, but since I was diagnosed with depression I started drawing and playing guitar and I'm also working on ideas for a board game (I love games and play a lot with my brother and his friends) and thinking of working on a screenplay again if I get any inspiration (most of my ideas were kind of pulp horror and grindhouse movies and I don't want to think about that as much.)

tl;dr: I imagine horrible things happening to people I love and I can't stop my anxiety form creeping in.",11,2012-09-16 04:04:35 EDT-0400

It's just that whenever the opportunity does arise, I freeze up and tell myself that she doesn't see me that way, and then another opportunity to get laid slips through my fingers. IMO, that's one of the worst things about anxiety: it's penchant for keeping me a virgin. And now I'm worried it'll never happen.

842,Anxiety and Leaky Gut,"Hey everyone,
I just wanted to put something out there. I have been pretty ill for a few years and have finally seen someone who appears to be helping me. At first I thought my almost constant nausea was a symptom of my anxiety, which stems from PTSD. After going off and on meds, struggling with daily nausea, ruminating thoughts, and panic attacks I went to the doctor who found a B12 deficiency. This lead me to further testing and finally a naturopath who diagnosed leaky gut, which can cause anxiety and a host of autoimmune issues.

I just wanted to say to everyone who has anxiety **remember to look at your diet!** Sometimes just cutting out caffeine or changing some eating habits can make a huge difference mentally as well. All the doctors just wanted me to go back to anti-anxiety meds which I had a bad experience with. I'm not saying that I won't ever go back on meds, or that everyone with anxiety has leaky gut, but I have noticed a huge difference in my anxiety since altering my diet. This may not apply to everyone, but it doesn't hurt to look into what you are eating. ",16,2012-09-21 05:23:48 EDT-0400

845,I dug my own grave way before my time and now I don't want to lay in it,"Hi, guys. I need help, and I need it really badly. I'm 22 years old and it feels like my life ended a long time ago. 
When I was 16... I just gave up. I had no friends, no skills, no interests, and no hopes for the future. Everything just went out the window, now it's time to just sit and wait for death, however long that may take. Of course, at that time, my parents were alive, and the only thing I had to look forward to was seemingly infinite school days. Having a roof over my head, ever, was not even on the list of concerns. That was a given and something that would always be true. I was an idiot. 

Now I find myself broke, jobless, skillless, friendless, parentless. When I leave the house, all I can think about is how much everyone already knows everything about me at a glance. I'm an outcast... a weirdo. Someone who just isn't quite at the same level as everyone else. That's how it has always been, and it just kills me. Why is everyone else in such a hurry to get around and go see people and do things? Why aren't I? 

Pretty soon, there won't be any turning back for me. I quit my job taking inbound calls (you were supposed to take a new call within 15 seconds of hanging one up... oh my dear god that is not enough recovery time from human interaction). My boyfriend is so fed up with my ""episodes"" that he's about ready to just leave. No one understands, or even wants to. They say to ignore the feelings. To just get over it. To just grow up. Fuck... whatever the solution is going to be, the word ""just"" does not belong in front of it. How do you just IGNORE the roaring lion with its mouth positioned around your head?

I can't afford therapy, or a psych, or anything. My strategy for the last 6 years has been to sit and wait for it to be over. To wake up and be a normal, functioning human being. That probably isn't happening. Now my brain is trained. It's formed these habits, and I can't escape them. I have no interests and no passion. When I sit down to attempt to learn something, or read something, or create something... or to do ANYTHING, my brain just says no. No, this is wrong. No, I have to be scrutinizing every muscle that twitched on my face today. No, I'm supposed to be beating myself up. Wait, stop, no, I have to beat myself up for beating myself up. Rinse repeat. Eventually, I get so angry with myself for not having gotten anything done that I'll just resign myself to never achieving anything. All over again. 

Lately, I've even gotten violent with myself. Someone said something that triggered this disgusting, self-effacing thought in my head. I reached some sort of critical mass and the next thing I know, we're on our way to the ER. I smashed my head into my knee, to stop myself from thinking the thoughts I had. My next worries were ""am I going to have a dent in my forehead for the rest of my life?"" Then, the ever popular... ""what will people think?"" 

I've gone in these circles so many times that I've walked myself into a hole, and it seems way too big to get out of. 

If anyone has any advice to give, or some sort of anecdote, or any words at all... please. Help me understand that there's still a life for me somewhere out there. ",14,2012-09-19 01:21:39 EDT-0400

I have conversations with them in my head that would never exist but become real anyway, and so I start to hate them and think that they hate me, but as soon as I start being around them again or even if I'm just sitting at home, pretty much all those feelings go away as long as I feel like I'm not being excluded from anything (Example: I asked one of them to show me some music that they liked, everyone really liked it but me, boom, anxiety). However, I can't exactly initiate any instance where I can feel included in something that we all like (of which there are a lot of things, I just have trouble recognizing that a lot) when I feel like any suggestion I have will instantly be met with scorn, so I just end up sitting there feeling anxious most of the time until one of them includes me in something.

855,How I completely rid myself of crippling anxiety.,"Hi!
 
Here is my backstory:
 
At around 15, I began to experience anxiety, mainly in social situations. Also, I got in a series of car wrecks that left me very anxious. Around this time I began seeing a therapist and a couple years later I began meds. But nothing helped that much.
 
The problem grew and by college I was avoiding people as much as possible. Eye contact was a nightmare. I wasn’t even comfortable looking at my family. Speaking in class was out of the question. And I would get anxious in cars and sometimes I'd just freak myself out while alone.
 
Well, from ages 15-30 I struggled terribly. I'm sure you're familiar with this story. It ruined my social life and my academic career. I couldn't hold a job. The few I had, I would sometimes have to hide in the bathroom, I’d perform tasks poorly, and ultimately I would just quit showing up. I would usually make up some convoluted excuse that I would leave on their answering machines, then never speak to them again.
 
Over these 15 years, I was on a total of 19 drugs. From Klonopin to Zoloft to Seroquel and Geodon. And saw nearly as many psychologists and psychiatrists. On more than one occasion I showed up at the ER, just wanting the anxiety and confusion to end. I’d get an MRI, which of course showed nothing, and other times I was given referrals to more Psychiatrists. Nothing worked. So, you get the idea.
 
Then, 16 months ago, I went through ""enlightenment"". It is silly useless word, but that's what people call it.
 
Here's how:
I downloaded the audio version of Eckhart Tolle's *The Power Of Now*.
I listened to it over and over again. Despite the occasional unappealing New Agey phrase (i.e., ""I have lived with several Zen masters, all of them cats. Or ""You are sitting on your own box of gold."" Oh, and he mentions Jesus (as a Zen master).  Jesus doesn’t freaking matter here, so hopefully that’s not too big of a distraction. Anyways, I knew that Tolle was pointing to a deep truth.
 
**So, here's basically the change required:**
 
**Learn to observe your mind**. For instance, think of your mother or job (or what/whoever). ""See"" with your mind the emotions and/or thoughts that are evoked by bringing you mother up. This “seeing” part of your brain is what we’re concerned with. 
 
Now stop thinking. And wait and see what the next thought will be to pop up in your brain.  It is *this* neurobehavior that you want to execute. Always be watching your thinking brain with your consciousness.  Try not to make any judgments or analyses, as those are themselves, thoughts.

After a while, it took about 6 weeks for me, you will come to the point where you can ""see"" every thought you make, and **you will be able to stop thinking whenever you want and for as long as you want**.
 
And here are two things that can help this process:
 
1. Realize deeply that it is literally always Now. This isn't meant to evoke a hippy attitude or make a philosophical statement; it's just an objective truth.
 
2. Feel your body as a whole from within. That may sound hippyish, but it has a grounding effect that keeps all of your attention from flying right up and into your head.
 
 
 
Tolle makes many metaphysical extrapolations from this shift in consciousness, but please don’t let that be a distraction for you. Your only responsibility in this is to adopt this neurobehavior I have described.
 
 
And so here’s what happened to me: I came out of my disorder 100%. Of course I can get apprehensive here and there, but that’s just human. And I’ve had some challenges to figure out along the way. But haven’t felt whole like this since I was a child. And socializing and working are no problem. I don’t take meds nor do I see a therapist. I won’t go on and on about my transformation, but hopefully this will help some of you, as I know very well the horrors of a mind out of control.

tl;dr - Had a lot of anxiety, now I have none. Observing your thinking brain is the way out.",26,2012-09-10 17:53:02 EDT-0400
856,[Help] Does anyone else have really bad anxiety after waking up in the morning or from a nap?,"I've been having some anxiety for about the last month and it all started after I moved to a different state to go to school. I really just felt that I was having trouble adjusting and that it would go away, but it hasn't yet. My boyfriend goes to school in the area too, but I started before him so we were apart for about a month. I thought that as soon as he got here everything would be a lot better, but I'm still having anxiety, especially in the morning. 

At first i was anxious about the move, whether i made the right decision, etc., and missing my boyfriend. Recently it changed to me being anxious about my college classes, but now I seem to be anxious for no reason. 
The last 3 days I've woken up feeling sick to my stomach and actually did get mildly sick. I thought it was because of a test I had Tuesday, but this morning I still felt sick. Even this afternoon when I woke up from a nap, I felt incredibly anxious for honestly no reason. 

I don't understand what's going on and why I can't seem to get rid of this. 
Anyone have any of the same experiences or advice? 
Thanks.

UPDATE: I just wanted to tell you guys that the past 5 days have been way better. The drinking more water idea has really been helping me, and so has just trying to stay as positive as I can all day. 
Thank you guys so much for your support! I never expected to get so many replies for this. 
I hope the others suffering from this get some relief soon as well!",33,2012-09-13 04:09:40 EDT-0400
857,FISH OIL IS FUCKING AMAZING.,"Supplements work differently for everyone else, but maybe it helps someone!


I bought fish oil capsules this morning (they're $6 for 100 capsules here) and took two. And over the course of only 3-4 hours, the constant anxious and nervous feeling went away. COMPLETELY. I can't fucking believe it - I've been living with this shit for 2 months now and it's just gone, like that. My old, familiar, slightly happy and relaxed permanent feeling has returned and it just feels sooo good. I took the car to get lunch for a few coworkers and myself a few minutes ago. I wasn't anxious even for a second. And I'm incredibly motivated. SO MUCH TO DO, SO LITTLE TIME.


Try it, guys, maybe it will help someone to live again :)) Any Omega-3 oils will do, I have salmon oil capsules.


Here's an article about it

858,I see your fish oil and raise you... RUNNING!,"I've had a really bad bout of anxiety these past few weeks. I can only guess why, but I have recently put in my two weeks at work for a new job, and I felt terrible about leaving all of my co-workers behind. The two weeks flew by in a terrible anxiety induced haze, but this week after my last day I bought a pair of running shoes and started running for the first time in probably 10 years and I've felt amazing since. Things were ~~a little better~~ really tough after the first run, but the best part has always come near the end of my sessions when the adrenaline has been flowing for a while. The anxiety crept back after a quick shower after the first run BUT was the best it had ever been. Slowly but surely it has dissipated after about a week. 

I'm not saying that exercise is the complete solution, I know that anxiety happens for different reasons, but it sure as hell doesn't hurt to try if you are physically able. I was inspired by [r/running](http://www.reddit.com/r/running), and I'd recommend checking out their beginner FAQ if you're interested. I'm doing the ""from your couch to 5K in nine weeks"" program, and while it was tough to start, it was well worth it, and I look forward to exercising on my running days now!

Again, I know that there isn't a cure all solution for anxiety, but I know how much it sucks and I wanted others to know what has helped me lately.

861,How do you stop worrying and over thinking before falling asleep? (without medication),"Heres my typical scenario: It's dark and quiet everywhere, alone in bed, have to get up in 6-7 hours and get ready to work. I didn't drink coffee, I took a nice shower, I'm very tired, I will surely fall asleep soon. 

No, I won't. During the night I will keep trying to relax, play white noise, think about fluffy cute pets, think about how good my next day will be, how I love my work, how good the life is..

No use. Some idiotic memories will come back. I feel embarrassed. Them I remember about my current relationship problems, my partner is not with me now, I miss him so fucking much, I start crying. Then I think about the future, I can only afford to save 5-10% of my salary, and I need to save 20% each month, what if I lose my job. What my partner will break up with me, what am I going to live for without him. What if he had an accident? What if he's dead???? It's 3am, I cant text or call him and wake him up. I have to wait until morning. What if he's dead. Crying again.

I'm the most pathetic person ever. I can't control my sleep. I have nightmares quite often, it doesn't help. 

I'm not on any medication, I'm willing to fight these thoughts on my own-please, if you can advise any method of how to fight with them, help me. I work in the coastguard, very often I would have to stay awake whole night - my sleep pattern is fucked up and I'm meant to learn how to fall asleep whenever possible, to regenerate. But I fail to do so, usually I don't get sleep for 1 whole night, and then next few - just 3-4 hours each night. And then on days off I sleep 7-8 max. It's not enough. I'm exhausted.",62,2012-09-11 19:36:14 EDT-0400

865,Hunger anxiety. Anyone else?,"To give a brief background, I'm a 21 year old male and I've had anxiety/panic since around the age of 14. I mainly have health anxiety but that branched into others like social anxiety and agoraphobia. 

Thankfully, my anxiety is stable much more these days thanks to counselling and self help. 

However, I've always had a high amount of anxiety in terms of being hungry. It stems from having a fear of passing out. 

When I eat, 2-3 hours later I'll feel starving hungry and I'll start to shake, feel anxious, have palpitations... Pretty much all the usual symptoms of low blood sugar. I've had a fasting blood test and my results were in the normal range so I always put down my hunger symptoms to anxiety.

I have to plan my days purely on when I'm going to eat next, making sure I eat every 2-3 hours in order to be sure my blood sugar won't crash low enough to make me pass out.

I'm more worried about this lately because I start a new job tomorrow and I'll have to go 5 hours without eating after lunch, I know this may sound really petty to most of you but it scares me because right now all my anxiety is based around me thinking I'll pass out because of how hungry I get and how I get all the horrible hunger symptoms.

Can anyone with anxiety relate to this? :(

866,Should I turn in a doctors note?,"Last night I had a panic attack, ending up in the ER until about 3AM. I got home and slept until about 2 today. Missing my college classes, two of them smaller and take attendance. I'll still have some days I can miss without excuses, but I also have a note from the ER.

Should I give the ER note to my professors to have it excused?

I kinda don't want them to know about it, but I also don't want to have a problem with the absence limit later.

871,"r/Anxiety, Looking back, what is the funniest or silliest panic attack you have had from anxiety?","For me, it was one morning three years ago, I was taking a shower.  I couldn't get out of the shower.   I'm not sure what if anything triggered the anxiety panic attack but my brain just refused to process for me how to get out of the shower.  Perhaps I was afraid I was going to be late for work if I couldn't get out of the shower, and well, for a few minutes, I couldn't get out of the shower.

I mean it's usually really easy to get out of a shower.  I normally turn off the water, and in some order, I grab a towel, open the curtain/door, dry off and step out.  My brain would not process this.  I was in the shower turning in circles with the water still on for several minutes.  I was looking for a way out.  A way to escape the shower so I wouldn't be late, and I freaked out.  After several minutes, I started yelling at myself -- Focus, Focus, Focus, and then my brain was like, duh, this is what you do.  Turn off the water...  And I was free of the shower.    

I had another panic attack a few minutes later trying to get dressed because the anxiety was in full swing.  I picked a shirt out of my closet, set it on my bed, turned back to get pants, and then couldn't find my shirt.  It was on my bed where I had set it down, but my brain was worried about being late and getting dressed, and it wouldn't process that it was right where I left it.  I started to freak.  Other options looking back could have been to pull another shirt out of the closet and put it on immediately, use a dirty shirt in the laundry hamper, or go to the car and get a spare shirt I kept there... but no, I had to find this shirt I had picked out, I couldn't find it right there in front of me, and I freaked out.

881,Anyone else experience heightened anxiety in intensely hot or humid weather?,"So I live in Chicago which has played loving host to a heat wave recently, and I've noticed that I have been much more prone to anxiety/panic attacks (especially during long periods outdoors). Temperatures have lingered around 103F during the day with between 50-60% humidity and not much relief at night.

One of my biggest triggers is when i feel like I can't breathe, so I figured it's  related to the combination of intense heat and humidity. The stuffy, thick air makes me feel a bit suffocated which can inspire a bit of an adrenaline rush and things sometimes snowball outward from there.

 I've been trying to expose myself to it as much as possible to get used to it and practice dealing with anxiety in uncomfortable situations, but I've had a few wicked panic attacks in the process. 

Does anyone else find themselves more susceptible during this kind of weather? If so, what is it that sets you off? Let's discuss.

NOTE: I am 22, male, and have been dealing with a panic disorder for about 4 years now. I've been through therapy and tried a few different drug combinations (Xanax only as needed has proven to be the most useful/least impairing), but I tend to prefer using breathing techniques and relaxation exercises to work through my panic symptoms. Also, From Panic to Power proved to be a useful book to me, but of you all have any other suggestions of books I would adore to hear them!

892,[Help]/[rant] Is it time for me to get help with my anxiety?,"I've felt like I've had some pretty bad anxiety going on 2 years now. It started after having to visit/apply to college and not being able to get a job because I am too timid. I've always felt insecure about my future since I realized that it's something I'm going to have to worry about. I'm clueless and doubtful of everything I do and can't make a decision for the life of me. It's mellowed out here and there but overall there's just a sense of me not measuring up. It's constant and gets in the way of everything in my life.

Recently, severely in the past few weeks, I've just got these extreme apathetic attitude and just feeling uncomfortable most of the time. I've lost my appetite, am experiencing nausea, can't really sleep at night. I've lost contact with most of the people I would associate with. The only person I ever really see or talk to is my boyfriend, and I feel as though I could lose him at any minute and have started getting paranoid and jealous. Especially because we're going to both be going back to school in two months and I feel I've grown too dependent on his company for my happiness. This is also my first real relationship and the first time I've ever had strong feelings for a person and I've realized how incapable I feel of being in a relationship, which is why I've always avoided them. Don't get me wrong, being with him is wonderful and I don't want it to end any time soon, but it both helps and hinders my anxiety.

I have to compulsively check things and I just can't relax. Today I spent the day pacing around and looking out the window every two minutes, expecting something to happen. This is all I have been doing when I am at home.

I rarely get out. I pass the time reading and painting and trying to keep my hands busy but I can't focus. When my family brings up how I don't have a job and how I need to have a thicker skin my eyes just start swelling with tears because I don't want to use this feeling of anxiety as an excuse.

Part of me really wants to get help but I don't want to take anxiety medication. I don't trust it. I want to feel like I have more control over it. I don't know if I'd want to seek medical help as in a therapist. I've tried to research vitamins that help with anxiety and I might try that. I've researched all kinds of tips to help with this stuff but I'm just totally stuck. I don't want these feelings to take over but I don't feel like they are going to end.

I know a lot of people who go through things like this and it becomes a habit for them and they grow used to it and I can't stand the thought of that. I used to be a passionate person who was obsessed with finding things to be in love with, and I've just grown dull since my second semester at college.

Though I felt really uncomfortable with my last psychiatrist and think this new guy is going to be better my anxiety is still amplifying. 

It's mostly just regular doctor visit anxiety (stomach knots/nausea, spinning thoughts, lightheadedness, throat closing) but geez louise. I hate this so much.

My irrational fear boils down to him hospitalizing me if I explain the full extent of my issues. It's irrational because I'm not a threat to myself or others...but the fear persists. It happens before any visit to any doctor.

Whether it's out to the movies with friends, or even stepping outside the house. I know this may sound like borderline agoraphobia, but as long as she rides out the first couple of minutes of being in the situation, she'll be fine. When food is involved, it seems to compound the issue, making it a lot worse for her.

She insists that having me there makes her feel a LOT better, but she does admit that it's definitely still there. She also feels terrible about all this as she feels like she's personally weighing me down and stopping us from doing the things that we can do. What I've always told her is that it's all non-sense and reassure her every time that I'll be there for her no matter what, but I really feel like I'm running out of support speech whenever something like this happens to her.

Whenever she has a panic attack or is feeling anxious, it just tears me apart on the inside. Reddit, what are some of the things I should and shouldn't do to help her?

Any advice is much appreciated, thank you.",4,2012-07-04 08:07:48 EDT-0400

902,A quick anxiety 101.,"I had this writing urge so maybe this may come of use to somebody.

So you have anxiety, or you think you might have anxiety. No worries, it’s a normal thing. That’s one big thing to remember: it’s normal. 

If you’re the unsure case, well, we need to know what anxiety is. Anxiety defined: a feeling of worry, nervousness, or unease, typically about an imminent event or something with an uncertain outcome.

Now, there are a few different major categories of anxiety. Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD) Phobia (Social, Specific), Panic Disorder, Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) and Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder. While it’s never good to self-diagnose, you can probably self-evaluate with a simple Google search to best learn what exactly is going on.

Anxiety is, for the most part, caused by adrenaline. Yes, the same thing that helps you avoid split-second car accidents, and gets your libido on. Some of our brains dump adrenaline at the most inopportune time; it’s too much of a good thing.

Once you know what’s going on, you can further analyze with behavioral analysis. Ask yourself:

* Stimulation - what were you doing?
* Thought - what were you thinking?
* Emotion - what were your emotions?
* Body Sensation - heartbeat, hot, cold, shaky
* Joy level - 1 to 5, where 5 is very joyous and 1 isn’t joyous whatsoever.
* Misery level - 1 to 5, where 5 is miserable and 1 isn’t miserable.
* Action - how did you act upon when stimulation?
* Going into the situation, what were your resources/strengths?
* Going into the situation, what were your vulnerabilities?
* Trigger - if any?
* What actions were helpful?
* What actions made the situation worse?

If you accumulate enough data, like anything, you can begin to understand it better. 

Then, there are some life hacks:

* Avoid caffeine - it’s a stimulant, and stimulants have properties that invoke anxiety.
* Avoid stimulants - see above.
* Physical stimulus - do something, be active, even if very simple. Stress ball, taking a walk, wrestling with your puppy. If your temperature goes up, your anxiety goes down.
* Have food in your stomach - you know how when you’re hungry, you’re often cranky? Yep, same concept applies here.
* If you’re medicated, make sure you’re keeping a steady habit of taking your medications.
* Sleep is vital. Don't get too much, but don't get too little. 7-9 hours is great.

Now, in some cases, such as social phobia, there isn’t really enough time to do that 10-step questionnaire (“hold on - feeling an onset of panic - gotta fill out this form!”). Why do we have social phobia? Well, it’s a natural thing. Some of us are just more natural than others. Common characteristics of social phobia is an extreme worry of scrutiny or judgement by others - most often by people around your age. That last bit is very key: by people around your age. For example, I’m great around parents, elders, and little kids, but if you bring someone +- 5 years of me, I’m a shitshow.

The best way to overcome such situations is desensitizing yourself. Think of it like playing the same song over and over and over (...) until you get sick of it. Well, same applies here: if you do the same thing over and over, soon, you’ll become less sensitive to the situation. It sucks at first, and remember it only gets better after that. Each time you’ll become less and less sensitive.

If you’re having a panic attack in a relaxed, laid-back environment, and are able to take a timeout, do some four-count breathing:

* In for four seconds.
* Hold for four seconds.
* Out for four seconds.
* Repeat for four minutes.

906,Anyone else find themselves paranoid about the most ridiculous things? ,"My anxiety comes and goes, and some days are better than others (I'm sure it's like this for most of you). However, I've come to realize that it's making me paranoid about a few things. 

Real example: The other day I picked up this neat clock for my room. I had it plugged in all night, and then the next day I was extremely anxious. For some ungodly reason, I thought that it was the clock that had made me sick. Something with it had made my anxiety worse, made me dizzier, made me more nauseous. I know this is crazy to think about, but it just is what I came up with. It's been that way with a few things, if I do or eat or get something and then have anxiety the day after, I blame it on anything that changed in my 'normal' routine. 

I'll end up usually avoiding those things, with the fear that my anxiety will be aggravated by it again. Does anyone else experience something like this?  ",13,2012-07-16 00:54:09 EDT-0400
907,Paper Handcuffs.,"Hi everyone. Nice to meet you. Here's my idea.

About moi: I have severe social anxiety, mild bi-polar disorder, ""pure O"" OCD, and I suffer from depression as well. 

For years, I have let them rule me. I have let them defeat me and steal my joy, rob me of my happiness - daily. Every new morning was a reminder that I was stuck in this cycle...this miserable hamster wheel...my biology having turned against me, making me a pathetic fool in a world full of folks who were living life...while I was losing mine to mental illness. So many days of my youth have been lost in suicidal abandon...sitting inside in the dark, wishing I had never existed, while my contemporaries ran in the sun, making love, earning prestige, and becoming champions in this world.

I tried pills. Prescriptions. They helped, to a degree, but often the cost was not worth the gain. I quit 'em cold turkey.

Since then, I've begun working out regularly. The benefit that regular exercise does for your mental well-being is impossible to under-emphasize. Jogging three times a week has done wonders for me.

There is a song that some of you older Redditors may recall. [Baz Luhrmann's ""Don't Forget To Wear Sunscreen""](http://youtu.be/sTJ7AzBIJoI). It was a novelty hit in the late Nineties. Played at graduations and such.

The line that I prize most from the song is this:

""Do one thing, every day, that *scares* you.""

I have taken this to heart. So each day, I endeavor to speak to that girl I'm too shy to introduce myself to. I work to say hi to that sad-looking stranger. I smile at a police officer, or I step out of my comfort zone in one of a million other ways.

So a few weeks ago, I got my server's permit and applied to work at a bar and grill.

I am naturally introverted. Making friends and being sociable is an effort for me. But I can do it. And the more I do it, the easier it becomes. Almost as if I'm coming out of my shell.

So I've decided to throw myself into the fire and see how I am forged.

There will be a few embarrassing weeks' worth of me forgetting customers' names, or misplacing orders, or being anxious and frightened when some burly trucker or an obnoxious dowager becomes irate with me because I brought their steak to them overcooked, or forgot to refill their iced tea in time.

But this awkward, painful purging of my introversion will be worth it.

For in a few months' time, I will no longer be afraid to walk up to that unbelievably gorgeous girl in the bookstore. Not ashamed of my appearance, or sabotaging myself with negative, self-effacing thoughts as I approach her. 

I will be able to meet someone who will love me. Someone I can give my whole heart to.

Why is any of this relevant?

I'm honestly not sure. But if I had to summarize, or venture a guess, I'd say this:

Fearing your demons gives them power. As soon as you have the balls to fight them head-on, you see them for what they are.

909,Brother & mom say it's in my head,"My brother has been pretty sick for two and a half years with an undiagnosed illness. It's a really long story, but he's frequently having surgeries and being rushed to the ER. 

During that time and maybe a year or two more, I've been struggling with debilitating panic and depression. To the point where I couldn't go to school without a number of doctor-ordered accommodations. 

Throughout that time, my parents have mostly paid attention to my brother's health. Which is understandable, because he's required a significant amount of hospital time and is constantly in physical pain.

The issue arises here, in that when I need help from my family they blow it off because I'm not obviously hurting. Frequently I'm told that it's all in my head and thus doesn't require their attention or help. This causes a lot of fights and tension that have yet to be resolved.

My question here is, how can I get them to understand that while my brother's pain is physically obvious and mine isn't, that shouldn't lessen my need for their understanding & help? I hope this made some sort of sense.",29,2012-07-15 10:19:10 EDT-0400

912,"SSRIs and Motivation (also, bonus rant on hypochondria!)","Hi all,

Last summer, I finally bit the bullet and got fairly extensive treatment for anxiety. I was put on medication (Celexa, then Prozac), and had individual and group counseling (primarily CBT, and some Acceptance Commitment Therapy). By around December, my motivation levels plummeted. I didn't feel like doing anything except watch every episode of Breaking Bad (2x), How I Met Your Mother, and Arrested Development. This continued for several months until I realized that I wouldn't be able to progress in my graduate program if I didn't work on my anxiety.

Ultimately, I decided that SSRIs were the primary factor in my lack of motivation, and this seems to be quite true. I weened myself off of the medication, and I feel that I am once again productive and making good progress. Has anyone experienced something similar?

As one might expect, getting off medication has brought up my anxiety level a bit. I can handle it better having gone through therapy, but I am now bouncing between worrying about having several different diseases (i.e. hypochondria classics such as MS, cancer, schizophrenia, cancer, etc.). Being a grad student, I have access to research journals, which sucks because I find myself looking up ""average age of onset for schizophrenia"" and trying to look for evidence that I am past the age that I am likely to get it. At night just before I go to sleep, I worry that some of my intrusive, random thoughts (not disturbing or violent in nature, just weird and dream-like thoughts) are, in fact, auditory hallucinations and that I am on the cusp of going crazy. Anyone experience this at all? I mentioned it in my group CBT class last fall and the therapist just gave tips on how to deal with anxiety at night (which is understandable and well-appreciated).

Anyway, thanks for reading!",17,2012-07-21 17:24:47 EDT-0400
913,"Control your blood sugar, possibly gain control over your anxiety!","I've lurked here for months since I realized that the 'episodes' I had been experiencing were actually panic attacks. I'm going to premise all of this by saying that my story is purely anecdotal. I'm not ""cured"" but have gotten my symptoms substantially under control. I'll try to be brief and please ask me to clarify if I've missed something.

I've suffered from hypoglycaemia for a long time. It runs in my family but up until 4 years ago I would only have hypoglycaemic attacks if I hadn't eaten for 12 hours or more. 4 years ago I started gaining weight and my blood sugar suffered for it. After nearly passing out during exercise a couple times, my doctor recommended eating a candy bar half way through my workout to keep my levels up. For some reason I translated this into, ""Eat sugary/carby things when you feel it coming on and you'll be alright."" It makes sense, doesn't it? If your sugar is low, eat sugar!

I packed on even more weight, close to 30 lbs in a little over a year. I was ""controlling"" my sugar by eating every couple hours, usually Nutrigrain bars or something similar. I began to develop a lovely case of health anxiety, bordering on hypochondria. A few other health issues (mysterious sharp head pain no one could diagnose, heart palpitations, etc) combined with a close family member dying of a sudden heart attack solidified my fears. 

I started having full blown panic attacks without knowing what they were. Originally I blamed them on my low blood sugar because the symptoms can be strangely similar, but it wasn't until I found this subreddit a while ago that I realized what was happening to me. I was obsessed with every twitch, twinge, and flutter that happened in my body. Like many people, I comforted myself with food. During this time I gave up caffeine, which helped. 

A little over a month ago, for reasons completely unrelated to my anxiety, I switched to a paleo-style of eating. If you aren't familiar with it, you basically eat fruits, veggies, meat, fish, and nuts. Clean eating free of sugars, wheat, and grains. Within two weeks my mysterious head pains disappeared and my sinus congestion (which I had thought to be allergies) was gone. After about a month it suddenly dawned on me that I hadn't had a panic attack in a long time. I hadn't even had a panicky thought in a long time! I'm calmer and feel more in control of my body.

Could it be? I looked it up and found [this](http://www.hypoglycemia.asn.au/2011/beating-anxiety-and-phobias/) article. I found others. Stories of people going decades with bi-polar diagnoses, depression, anxiety, suddenly feeling better once they got control of their blood sugar. Google it, they're out there!

I'm sharing what has worked for me, so far. I'm sure I'll have set backs, but I've gotten control and I'm *healthier* for it. All it takes is 30 days to know if it might work for you too.",29,2012-07-19 01:12:56 EDT-0400

916,"My Anxiety is destroying my stomach, seriously impacting my life/work","I've had these serious stomach aches for almost 6 months now. They started out as cramping for maybe 2 - 3 hrs after eating in the evening, but turned into having bloating, gas, cramps, diarrhea, and constipation (alternating about every month) all day. I had a particularly bad bout on a school trip, and was unable to participate in any activities. We were in St. Louis for a week. I also had to pass on a work-related backpacking trip, knowing that my stomach would act up (and the wilderness is not a place you want to be when that happens).

When I'm with my girlfriend, I will have to spend 1 + hours in the bathroom (total), oftentimes interrupting activities or ruining plans. 

It's also extremely painful. I have my symptoms from when I wake up in the morning until I go to bed at night. It makes working hard, and I've had to sacrifice productivity in order to deal with my issues.

Because of this, my anxiety gets worse. I'm constantly afraid of a flare up, and experiencing constant guilt about how my condition imposes on others. This in turn makes it worse, and the cycle continues. 

I knew I had issues with stress, but I've recently come to realize that I've had serious anxiety issues for the past few years. 

I've tried to advocate for help, but my parents are convinced it's all in my head and that I can wish it away. They also think I have some sort of disease, but all medical testing has come back negative. Medicines don't help, nor do supplements.

I want to learn how to manage my anxiety, as well as ask for help with the stomach problems. There was a thread here recently about physical symptoms of anxiety, and bowel issues were a common thread among all posts.

917,Would an anxiety attack cause me to have this skewed perception of reality?,"First time on r/Anxiety. 

And first off, I was diagnosed with depression about 5 years ago, but my parents wouldn't medicate me because ""it's just teenage angst"" (I'm almost 19 now).

Yesterday, my boyfriend and I got two kittens, he got a haircut (maybe the change in his appearance had something to do with this?), and his best friend was visiting from out of town, so he was acting slightly differently. I was sitting on the couch, when all of a sudden I felt really... off. My brain was making me feel as if my boyfriend and I had broken up and I was just visiting his apartment (which is our apartment), even though that's obviously not true. I didn't think that was actually happening, but it felt like it. 

I tried explaining it to a friend, but it's difficult. I was just sitting on the couch, a bit stressed, a little tired (yesterday was a long day), and all of a sudden, looking at my boyfriend, my brain started making me feel as if I was in a scenario where we had broken up and I was coming to visit, but I was in love with him and wanted him back.
I didn't actually think any of this was going on, but that's what it felt like. 

So I asked my boyfriend to come sit next to me on the couch, which he did, and we held each other for a minute or two. During that time, it was as if my emotions were like they would be if I was living in the reality of my brain's perception, if that makes sense. I felt like we were broken up, and I started to cry, even though I know we're still together, and we live together, etc.

I have a history of panic attacks where I hyperventilate, can't breathe, and I basically have a meltdown. But this was more or less an internal freak-out for no reason, that came on all of a sudden, and lasted long enough that I went to take a nap in our bed to try to grasp reality.

When I woke up, I was much better.
But I was talking with a friend, and tried using google to figure stuff out, and all I could think was an anxiety attack.

You guys should let me know what you think.

921,Should I worry about tolerance to alprazolam (xanax)?,"My home doctor gave me **0,5 mg alprazolam** (xanax), to use three times a day for panic attacks (on top of the 150 mg venlafaxine (effexor) I already use). The problem is, I rarely have spontaneous panic attacks. They come when I have stress, and since I'm free for summer, I make sure I have no stress at all. (This is major avoiding, I know.) Because of all the warnings for addiction and tolerance, I only take one or even a half when I visit friends, family, the doctor or when a spontaneous attack does come up. On sunny days like this, with no obligations, I can handle myself quite all right, aside from the constant anxiety that I can live with.

**How much should I worry about tolerance or addiction, considering I only take these alprazolam pills when I need them, which is not even daily?**

922,"[Success Story] Due to a recent personal breakthrough, my anxiety is now massively reduced.","I had a fucking HUGE breakthrough recently.  
    
When I was a young teen my mother developed paranoid schizophrenia and left the family.  I held onto the pain to keep her away from me so that I wouldn't be vulnerable to getting hurt again.  Layered on top of this was the panic attacks that would arise to keep me from feeling that pain.  Unfortunately, they triggered (for reasons I'm still not sure about) whenever I needed to do work and be responsible for myself.  
  
I'd been working with a behavioral therapist and learned to sit with the emotions without trying to change them.  At some point I realized the source of my panic attacks was avoiding the pain.  The panic attacks stopped, but the subsequent emotional pain was just as bad, maybe worse.  I reached out to a former roommate of mine who has experience working as an AA sponsor.  A lot of his advice didn't help me, but he did suggest forgiving my mother.  I did so out of enlightened self-interest*, and a large chunk of the pain vanished.  Then I decided that mom wouldn't want me to be unhappy, and decided to let go of the rest of the pain.  And that's where I stand right now.  
  
The freaking out, the hyperventilating, the muscle spazzes, the fetal rocking... all of that is gone.  All that remains is an annoying buzzing sensation.  It still puts me off of doing some of the work, but it's not NEARLY as bad as it had been.  If before the discomfort was 10/10, now it's closer to 2/10.  5/10 on my worst day.  
  
So now I'm dealing with a more conventional anxiety.  I've been in my own little coccoon for entirely too long, and now I'm going to start pushing myself slowly but surely to take advantage of this newfound freedom.  It's terrifying, but so long as I keep taking it one step at a time, I should be able to handle it.

924,Out the front door with agoraphobia,"I have agoraphobia.  But it was not my first issue.  I was seven years into dealing with bipolar disorder when at a work function at a theme park, I had my first panic attack.  The two issues, anxiety and bipolar worked in tandem to escalate me to the point of being homeward bound for a year.  In many ways the agoraphobia has wreaked more havoc than the bp.  (for those who do not know what agoraphobia is, it's a fear of spaces...so riding in cars, being in crowds, and standing in lines are equally disturbing).  I do not show the top symptom of feeling as through I'm having a heart attack, as is indicative with panic attacks...No, my symptoms immediately culminated in my intestines and issues there...So it was just a lot of fun, fun, fun...

Now, I am Nearly eleven years into the agoraphobia thing, and after finding medication that was not a narcotic to deal...I am able to cope.  I am a psychologist and have done a lot with cognitive reframing, so was able to get myself off the medication for the agoraphobia...My physical body thanked me :)  But I have to work at it all the time...

An example...My husband and I went to see some of my family for a few days.  I must say I handled the excursion brilliantly, but I have also not left the house except once in the past two weeks.  I find that as long as I have a means of being productive without avoiding the need to go out for whatever reason, I can extend myself that luxury, but since being home I have slept much more than usual and have had problems with flu like symptoms.  This is not new, just part of the animal.  

I have run into people over the years who rail against anxiety, and I understand completely, but doing so only causes much more.  I have learned to accept that I have limitations, to work around them, and to slowly push myself past set parameters.  So, when I find I am avoiding going out the front door, I set a time that I must do just that, and so on and so forth.  I know that I risk a panic attack, but waiting an not continually being on top of the illness only allows an open door for it to come back full force.  

I would encourage anyone with this very debilitating type of anxiety, to be gracious to yourself and to set small goals that you can conquer.  It does work.  It took me a lot of years, but I did it.  You can too.  Here is to stepping out the front door! ",3,2012-07-18 23:36:47 EDT-0400

Every time I put my head to starting, I'll work for about two minutes, until I get worried about actually going through with the work. 


Somewhere I know I can do it, and as soon as I *start*, properly start, I can literally get it done in about 3 hours of just working. But it takes seemingly days of sitting doing absolutely nothing, not getting spurred into working.


I can't think because I'm worrying about how I can't just get it done. Then I worry that I'll do it, but it'll be terrible. My housemate keeps telling me it's my fault, and that if I just sit down I'll just do it. But I literally can't! It's bad because I am clever, and I want to do well, but being nervous about my work really doesn't help and means I end up rushing everything.

Does anyone else have this, and have any ways to get over the avoidance? ",93,2012-12-03 02:50:47 EST-0500

Instead of letting myself go in to a full blown panic attack, I let my body experience what it was going through. I kept telling myself that what was happening was my body taking care of itself. I excused myself from work for the day, came home and took a promethazine to get rid of the nausea and engaged in calming activities. By night time, I was feeling almost back to normal, to the point where I could eat some crackers and jelly, and felt stronger because of the experience. I'm not obsessing over it today and am not constantly scanning my body to see if I feel even the slightest twinge of nausea, thus creating more anxiety.

----
**Slow breathing exercise**

*To be practised regularly and at the first signs of anxiety or panic.*

1. Hold your breath and count to 5 (do not take a deep breath)
2. When you get to 5, breathe out and say the word *relax* to yourself in a calm, soothing manner.

3. Breathe in and out slowly through your nose in a 6 second cycle. Breathe in for 3 seconds and out for 3 seconds. This will produce a breathing rate of 10 breaths per minute. Say *relax* every time you breathe out.
4. At the end of each minute (after 10 breaths) hold your breath again for 5 seconds and then continue breathing using the 6 second cycle.
5. Continue breathing in this way until all the symptoms of over-breathing or hyperventilation have gone.",2,2012-12-07 07:58:31 EST-0500

937,You're not alone with Anxiety.,"I have anxiety. It's a very annoying problem. It affects me 100 percent of the time. It affects me almost no matter what I'm doing in some way.
The thing that people with anxiety (including myself) are trying to do at all times: Be safe.
Things we can't help but do all the time:
•	Second guess ourselves
•	Behave impulsively and reactively
•	Take everything personally
•	Worry
•	Have difficulty accepting compliments
•	Worry
•	Have difficulty finding the courage to respond
•	Worry
•	Have difficulty not being suspicious of others' intentions
•	Worry
•	Make a huge deal out of the smallest things
•	Think we are bothering you
Things you should keep in mind:
•	We're scared of everything
•	Almost all the time
•	It's an actual disorder
•	It manifests as impulsive behavior
•	You can't fix us with words
•	Telling us ""worrying is silly"" won't make us stop worrying
•	It only makes us feel silly
•	And then we'll worry more
•	""Oh god, what if I am worrying too much? What if they call me silly again?""
•	We have a lot of armor
Things you can do for someone like me:
•	Stick around
•	Ask if we're comfortable in a place or situation
•	Be willing to change the place or situation if we are not
•	If you ask and we aren't okay, but you aren't willing to change it, you lose our trust
•	Activities that help take our mind off things are helpful
•	Try not to take our reactions (or lack thereof) personally
•	Give us time to respond to you
•	We will obsess over how we are being interpreted
•	We anticipate being judged
Things you should not do:
•	Tell us not to worry
•	Tell us we'll be fine
•	Mistake praise for comfort
•	Ask if we are ""getting help""
•	Force us to be social
•	Force us to do things that trigger us
•	""Face your fears"" does not always work because- remember, scared of everything
•	It's more accurate to say we are scared of the fear itself
If you have an anxiety disorder:
•	Know that it is OKAY
•	Even if you worry that it is NOT okay
•	It's still okay. It's okay to be scared. It's okay to be scared of being scared
•	You are not crazy, you are not a freak
•	I know there's a person under all that armor
•	And I know you feel isolated because of it
•	I won't make you take it off



In my case specifically, anxiety affects all of my life. Every, single, thing that I do, is affected by anxiety. My anxiety affects me in the way that I feel sick and scared. I don't know what I'm scared of, so don't ask me. I don't know why I feel sick, so don't ask me. All I know is that I do, and the way to combat it is to avoid things that trigger me most. 
	When I am forced to stay somewhere, my anxiety is worst. In class, in a car, in the mall, at a store. Being outside, being at home, at a close friends' house, are the safest I feel. At home, I feel very safe. This affects me in the way that I can't go out of town. I can't go visit people. I don't go to the lake. I don't go to the snow. I don't go to the mountains. I don't go anywhere that makes me feel scared. 

	I did not write the part with bullet points. I copied it from a Reddit forum post about anxiety, because it applied very well. When I first read it, I cried. Not because I'm a pussy. But because it was the first time I felt like someone else understood me. The first time I felt like I fit in with other people. The first time I felt normal.

	Anxiety has been hard to deal with. Hard to live with. But, it has changed my views somewhat in a good way. Because anxiety affects most of my life, I see no reason to EVER be sad, angry, any bad emotions in any way. Mostly because my life is already filled with this. But I look at things so positively now. At least there IS something positive about anxiety. Something that makes up for some of the bad. My mind is opened so much to positive things, feeling good, being free, having fun, living life, being ME. Being who I want to be, not what anxiety is trying to force me to be. Things don't make me sad anymore; it's like I have a wall that blocks the bad, because I see no reason for any of it to exist. I'm very happy in my life, as much as possible. I want everyone to be this happy.

I wrote this paper because I want people to know exactly what it's like. More for me to show people I know, but I think I may post it on some websites. I want people to know what I go through- what WE go through. I hope this has changed your view on the topic, or opened you up more. And I'm always willing to talk to ANYONE. If you want to talk, you can email me at marshal.lewis@yahoo.com.. I'll reply to everything :)

But please, know that you are NOT alone. You aren't the only one. I feel just like you do. I can relate.

942,My irrational fear of smelling bad is consuming my life.,"It sounds like such a silly thing to worry and obsess over. What started as a mere thought has manifested into an immense social anxiety and borderline paranoia (as my psychiatrist calls it) over the past couple of weeks. I shower every day, and only wear clothes that have very recently been washed, yet every time I take a seat in class, I am overwhelmed with the feeling that I am emitting a horrible odor that is offending everyone in the room. If anyone so much as coughs, sneezes, or sniffles, I assume that is it because of my odor, and thus my anxiety skyrockets. If just one person steps away from me for reasons that are not otherwise obvious, I assume it's because of me. I've become so obsessed with observing other peoples' actions around me that I can't concentrate on anything else. I'm already in danger of failing one of my classes.

My psychiatrist prescribed 50mg Seroquel for me to take at night. It helps curb a lot of the anxiety attacks and some of the paranoia, but it zaps me of all energy and doesn't do much to control the thoughts that keep me worrying. 

I'm so exhausted. I don't know how to get rid of these thoughts that cause so much anxiety, as well as shame and embarrassment. No one has ever told me outright that I stink, and my friends maintain that I don't. For the most part I know that it's all in my head, so how do I get it out of my head?",13,2012-12-04 23:33:07 EST-0500

944,Sharing with you all that's tended to help me,"I have been resistant to getting professional help, probably because my dad's a licensed mental health professional and I'm very lucky/cursed for it. Our general consensus is that I have GAD, emetophobia, and hypochondria. I have constant neurotic conflicts DAILY, but I'll have my periods of peace and happiness, and I try to cultivate the things that keep me that way. So I wanted to share with you all what has helped me over the years.



When it comes to life feeling overwhelming with things that need to get done:
* dry-erase boards

* dry-erase calendars

* categorized lists of things in order of priority

* journaling at night. Or, just notebooks filled with lyrics from my favorite songs because the mere act of handwriting feels good and takes my mind off things. Good practice for penmanship too. Channels all my jittery energy into striving for neat handwriting.



When in the middle of a panic attack, it's very hard to kill it. There's not much to do but ride it through. Cry. If I'm not crying yet, I make myself. Something about tears kind of helps it along. I don't involve anyone because their sense of helplessness when seeing me lose my shit makes me feel worse. I open a window after a while. Go for a walk. Put on the ""calm down"" playlist which includes The Weepies, Lifehouse, Iron & Wine, Edward Sharpe & the Magnetic Zeroes, Norah Jones and the song called ""Regression"" by Dream Theater which I highly recommend. 


Smelling citrus or other pleasant aromas I've heard calms your brain down and may even help with nausea-related anxieties. I was on the verge of a panic just a little earlier and (sorry, weird confession) whiffed my roommate's Old Spice deodorant and I've since calmed down. 


Getting lost in a calming TV show or some light comedy. Or dark comedy. Comedy that makes all things shitty in life hilarious. Louis CK, Ricky Gervais, Monty Python... if I find a way to laugh at the ridiculousness that is my irrational fears, I find some control again.

And lastly, trees. But this is tricky. You have to really know yourself and your limits for this to be beneficial because it can be equally counter-productive as I've had my thoughts racing too fast and lead to panic attacks because I overdid it. But it's quelled nausea for me before and calmed me way down. 

Tea, yoga, exercise, drawing, painting, writing, talking to people who understand, looking at NaturePorn, soothing music, soothing scents, comedy, walking outside, reading... in one form or another, these things have helped me immensely. Sometimes nothing seems to work when in the clutches of the worst panic attack, but you there's no harm in trying to have these in your quiver for counterattacking it. Hope this helps, and please feel free to share what helps you!

Today I went back to my doctor and he said that he didn't want me getting addicted to xanax so he prescribed me Zoloft. Zoloft seems a little bit sketchy to me in the sense that it can cause people to have thoughts of suicide. I'm just in here really to see what you all think about Zoloft. Did it help you?

Every single person has stayed up one night freaking out over something that either wasn't in their control or was really nothing to freak out about. And it is okay. 

The most important thing you can do throughout your entire time with overcoming anxiety is to love yourself. You are beautiful, wonderful, funny, smart, engaging, and just fucking swell. Remember that! Remind yourself of that. Focus on all the great things about you because if you just put yourself down, you won't be able to get up.

I was going to drive home, so I didn't drink anything but apple juice and some soda. When we were at the party, we decided that I would drive some of the family's friends home, which was quite a long drive. When I was driving, suddenly the cops came and pulled me over. They told me that some people driving behind me earlier thought that I was driving unstable, and had called the cops as they thought I was drunk-driving. 

The real issue here was when they pulled me over. When the cops walked over to my car, i suddenly started shaking, and I felt my heart beating extremely fast. As I didn't want my passengers to be worried, i focused a lot, and managed to stop shaking. They gave me an alcohol test, which was negative, told me not to worry (I think they saw how stressed out I was) and then I got in the car and drove away.

I remained calm until i dropped off my passengers, and started driving towards my apartment. On my way home, a car behind me started flashing its lights repeatedly on me (in a tunnel), and at that point, I freaked out. I drove off the highway, and took a longer way home, just to get away from that car. When I parked outside my apartment, i just sat down next to the car, shaking extremely and I started crying, unable to stop.

965,Hypochondria is so fun,"I post from time to time under another username, but mostly lurk here rather than sharing my own personal story.  I just wanted to use this throwaway to say it's incredibly therapeutic reading about other people's problems.  And I figured I'm dump some of my own issues here just to make anyone who is feeling the same way feel a little less alone.  

Does this sound familiar to anyone?

I've always been a bit anxious (social anxiety and hypochondria especially) but lately it's been pretty awful.  I had a cancer scare  earlier this year (a potential superbad melanoma that turned out to just be some burst blood vessels).  There was a lot of time waiting for pathology reports and during that I was a wreck.  I just couldn't stop thinking about dying and leaving my two little kids behind.  It was constant panic.  Just awful.

Since then, my hypochondria has gone out of control.  I went to the doctor for a swollen lymph node (shotty, painless, firm, mobile, ~1cm maybe) in my neck.  He told me to ignore it.  Then 3 weeks later things kind of started to spiral a bit.  I switched primary care physicians in here at some point (how classic) because I couldn't get in to see the old one on the day I needed him.

Just as kind of a rundown out of my journal:

6/8/12:  Mild pressure in the back of neck.  No lumps or bumps there.  Strained?  Swollen left salivary gland.  Stone again?  Gland swelling went down with some massage.  Caught the stomach flu the kids have.  

6/9:  Poking at the salivary gland yesterday, now the left side of my face feels numb from my ear to my eye.  Not really numb, because I can feel things fine.  It feels numb and then I touch it and the numbness sort of vanishes.  Pressure behind my left ear.  Maybe a patch of numbness on my left arm.  Brain tumor? Parotid tumor? or pinched nerve...

6/14: Symptoms persist.  They aren't there in the morning, but only show up or get noticed at maybe 9am.  Saw doctor and asked for phych referral.  She checked organs and lymph nodes and ears and throat and breathing and told me I'd probably pinched the facial nerve poking at the salivary stone and it'd potentially take weeks to heal.

6/20: Same symptoms, except no numbness in my arm anymore.  Maybe some on my other cheek?  No pain, but maybe just some discomfort in upper right abdomen.  Pain in right side of back.  Feels close to the surface.  Pancreas or liver cancer?  Peritonitis?  Referred pain from back combined with crazy brain?  

6/21: Saw therapist.  It was OK.  She doesn't do CBT.  Meeting again in a couple weeks, will ask about switching to someone who does CBT.

6/22: Same symptoms.  A bit of a headache (before it was just a pressure sensation).  Numb left middle finger.  Pressure above left eye.

6/23: Vacation.  Not much anxiety.  Felt pretty good.  Mild headache/left face numbness, but not the center of my attention.  Finger is no longer numb.  

6/24: Vacation.  Same.

6/25-26@1:30am Moderate intensity panic attack.  Didn't sleep for around 3 or 4 hours.  Felt like I couldn't breath.  Headache.  Just couldn't sit still or stop listening to my body.  Mild chest pain on left side, but nothing I haven't felt before.  Should have gotten up and gone for a run or something.

6/26: Severe anxiety all day.  bad headache.  trouble breathing.  left side chest pain.  very aware of the sensation in my abdomen.  I think it's getting worse.  And by worse, I probably mean I'm just noticing it more.

6/27: Pretty relaxed.  Abdomen sensation is there.  Maybe some sinus pressure in right nose/under eye.  Not much headache/pressure/numbness.  I've lost 5lbs in a week and a half.  Yay?  Haven't been real hungry.

6/28: Two newly noticed swollen lymph nodes that feel like previous ones.  Pinky tip sized in neck, slightly larger in groin.  Head pressure thing is better.  Almost gone.  Numbness is better but still there.  Sore spot at front floor of mouth under tongue.

The worst part is, I know this is all pretty classic.  Nothing that's going on is really outside of the realm of what could be caused by anxiety.  None of it is even really painful enough that I'd normally care about it (aside from the headaches)...more like, just a hyperawareness of my body.    

I'm a scientist.  I work in medical research.  I have a great life, a great family, no substance abuse problems.  I exercise a lot and eat well.  I know how insanely unlikely it is that in the course of 20 days I'd go from a perfectly healthy 33 year old guy to one with some terrible cancer that affects my facial nerves, lymph nodes, abdomen, back, headaches...yet none of it rises to the level of terrible pain and I'm still able to carry on with all my normal daily activities (running 4 miles a day, taking care of kids, working at my desk job).  Cancer doesn't generally go from nothing noticeable to some sort of crazy super mild systematic thing in two or three weeks!   And if I were that sick, I'd probably not feel almost 100% fine from the time I went to sleep until an hour after I woke up.

I know what a failure this health anxiety can make you feel like.  But it ain't your fault.  I'm doing everything right, but here I am.  It can happen to anyone.

I'm going to kick this thing's ass and so can you.  I've started using one of the CBT iPad apps and it really helps sort of make the busted thinking process clear.  I'm going to get a better therapist lined up (thank god for health insurance).  One who specializes in health anxiety.  Writing all my feelings about this down in a journal is reassuring, but even better is reading about all other people experiencing the same sort of things.  So, thanks!",32,2012-06-28 22:23:31 EDT-0400

My overall body temperature also changes easily. And when people talk to me, I get really flustered and stressed.

968,"Does anyone else feel like trying to move forward is pointless, that your anxiety will inevitably drag you back down? ","I've been suffering from GAD and Panic Disorder for over 4 years now (even though I've had anxious tendencies for longer). I dropped out of high school because of my anxiety, quit the only job I ever had because of a series of massive panic attacks while on the clock, have missed numerous appointments, dates, and possible job offers all because my anxiety holds me back. I've fallen into a rut where I do the same thing day in and day out, making money and enjoying a few hobbies as best I can through the computer. 

My anxiety also comes in waves. For a couple of weeks I could be fine, but then I could randomly get a spell of anxiety that could last for a week or more. I'm currently in the middle of one that started after doing a large amount of yard work. I've been in a constant 'high alert' feeling for the last week, with little panic attacks sprinkled in here and there. I look back on how I used to be before all of this, and I also look and see what my friends and family who are my age are doing with their lives, the progress they've made, and it really brings me down.

I have goals, dreams, desires, but I just can't seem to pull together the motivation to do anything about them. I feel as though if I try, I'll inevitably fail as I always have. 'What if I get a job at this awesome company?' 'Well, then I'm sure your anxiety will bite you in the ass, and you'll have to quit. Quitting will disappoint your boss, your parents, and yourself. So why try?' I know it's negative, but even if I try and drown out those thoughts with more positive thinking, it always is in the back of my mind. One step forward, two steps back.

970,r/Anxiety: what are your irrational fears?  I'll start.,"Mine might not be the same as yours or even make any sense to you.  Yours might not make sense to me either, but hearing other people's irrational fears helps me relax a little bit because I realize I'm not alone in my suffering.  Hopefully it can help some of you too.

Some of my irrational fears include:

* falling backwards and breaking my skull when I'm walking outside
* falling in the shower
* having my legs just break underneath me
* getting shot in the mall or while on public transportation
* that someone will push me onto the subway tracks
* that I will suddenly stop breathing and die a slow painful death
* that I will have a heart attack in a public place
* that I will have any sort of urgent medical problem in a public place
* buttons. I hate buttons. I hate touching them, and I hate clothes that have them.

973,"Yesterday I finally went to get some help. But I still 
have some questions.","For the last couple months, I have been experiencing what I believe is anxiety and panic attacks, and it got really bad over the last couple of days. I have had an almost continuous feeling of unease, like something is wrong with the world, but I can't pinpoint it at all. I also sometimes feel like I am going crazy even though I have no other symptoms of actually going crazy. I worry about mundane things to things that are totally implausible. It seems to happen randomly, although worse at night and in the evenings. Right now I feel upset for no reason.

Last night I went to the urgent mental health clinic, although they did not give me any counseling. I feel like I need the answers to some questions while I try to get a real evaluation. I left a message at my old school's institute but they have not called back yet.

1. What do I do to calm down when actually experiencing a panic attack?
2. What do I do when experiencing a general low level of anxiety throughout the day?
3. They prescribed me Celexa, but my roommate feels very strongly that I should not take it due to her own personal experiences, and my parents feel the same after seeing their friends' kid take it. Do any of you have experience with it?
4. They also prescribed Trazedone if I need help sleeping (I think maybe I do, my sleep is often broken). Do any of you have experience with this one?
5. Lastly, is this common for anxiety sufferers? No one has confirmed that I actually have anxiety. I'd appreciate knowing that I'm not alone, and would love to hear absolutely anything encouraging or helpful you may have to say.

I'm sorry for the length of this post. I am going to go to my yoga class for the next 90ish minutes and will return afterwards. Thanks for listening, friends.",29,2012-06-28 05:00:05 EDT-0400
974,"I had a scary experience, and I still feel shaken","I had to take a friend to the hospital a couple nights ago. He had too much to drink and had not had much food or any water through a long day of drinking and dancing in the sun. I tried to take him back home on the subway; I didn't yet realize just how drunk and dehydrated he was. He began to panic and scream as we were on the train. He alternated between screaming and being almost completely unresponsive. There wasn't really enough food or water in his system throw up, but he was very sick. The EMTs brought a stretcher for him onto the train platform. I brought him home several hours later and he was panicking, although now sober enough to be more coherent. He spent an hour or two repeating how much he hated himself and how scared he was to me, and then eventually he fell asleep. 

I was very shaken that day, and cried often. I know it hasn't been very long since then, but I still don't feel like seeing anyone, especially him. The thought of seeing him makes me very anxious, which is extra-difficult because he is my closest friend. I.. I don't know what to do.

976,"A letter to anyone who doesn't understand Panic & Anxiety. It saves time, and the stress of re-writing it...","There are some things I want you to know about me and my condition.

I am not necessarily shy, that's not what having a panic disorder is. I am an outgoing person who often feels trapped inside a wall of fear. I get really angry sometimes because what I feel like is the real me is trapped behind my anxiety. I probably want to be affectionate and laid back and fun at any given time but you make me nervous. It's not your fault, it's just people- it's nothing you do or did. I can only become desensitized to people by spending a lot of time with them and even then sometimes it doesn't work. Sometimes, with some people, it works right away.

I know that what I'm afraid of isn't real. I know that the threat is an illusion and that I'm not really going to get hurt, but my body is telling me otherwise. I try to talk myself out of it but ""fight or flight"" is one of the most basic and powerful instincts of the body, and it doesn't always listen.

I am working really hard to combat my anxiety disorder. Some days I start to give up because I've been fighting for so long and it doesn't seem to change, or I make progress and then I backslide. It's inevitable that I get depressed and may not seem to be working to help myself. Having an anxiety disorder is really hard and I promise I'm doing what I can. Much of the fight that goes on with my condition happens inside the head, so while it might not seem like I am trying to help myself, I am.

I am constantly exhausted. If your body went through intense terror each day (or sometimes, just from time-to-time) and then crashed, you'd be exhausted too. I have to make myself move when I am crashing and sometimes I just have to sleep. My body doesn't present that as an option; it's just an order- ""You. Sleep. Now"". Sometimes I don't get things done because I am tired. Please don't get mad at me if I don't always do everything I am supposed to do- it can be a real struggle to do little things that most people don't think twice about, like walking into a store, running errands, sometimes even leaving my house.

Some of my behavior might seem pretty odd at times. I might make someone go with me to places I ought to be able to go to alone because I need a ""safe"" person there. I might come off as clingy and dependent on others, but my reasoning is not what you might assume- ""safe"" people are our anchors to sanity. Real or not, we assume we can count on them to help us if we become terrified, and that can make the difference between fleeing a place or being able to stick it out. We develop triggers in specific places and that place, as innocuous as it might seem to you, scares me to death. I don't want to feel that way; it's embarrassing, but I do. How would you feel if you were terrified out of your mind in a place or around a person you know is harmless in your heart?

I try many things to combat my anxiety. If you've heard about a technique, I've probably heard about it. I've tried meditation, yoga, acupuncture, keeping active, positive self-talk, cognitive behavioral therapy, regular therapy, and medication, among things. I've probably tried lots of different medication. Anxiety disorder (and depression, since the two are linked- you'd be depressed if you had an anxiety disorder) often get treated with strong medication, and strong medication has side-effects. When I am trying new medications I might be ""off"" and irrational. Please forgive me, it's not me, it's the meds. Also, some meds make me extra tired or dizzy or any number of other things that aren't my normal or desired state. Most medication used to treat anxiety is something the body becomes immune to over time, so the dosage must be increased. So, occasionally I may relapse when I am not expecting it. I don't necessarily know the cause.

Please don't make fun of me when I am experiencing a panic attack- it's horrible enough without you ridiculing me. You wouldn't be laughing if you were the one whose body was revolting in fear. I'm not making anything up, I'm not trying to use panic attacks as an excuse not to do things, and I surely don't want to be a burden on you or effect your life negatively. Knowing I sometimes am and sometimes do adds to the misery of the condition. What I really need is for you to let me hold your hand or your arm tightly at times, and to humor me and just tell me it isn't real and I don't have to be scared, even if it's the millionth time you've said it. Tell me you'll protect me and I might just believe you, because I want to so badly. I want to be tough and independent and in control, but something (psychological and chemical) inside of me won't let me be free.

Panic disorders are almost always genetic and are chemically related, though they're often triggered by a traumatic event. Before realizing what is happening to us, most panic disorder sufferers go through a terrible period of thinking that we're dying when we're having a panic attack, or that something terrible is about to happen to us, etc. It's impossible to understand when it first happens, unless someone is there to warn you. There usually isn't.

Many of us live in terror of letting other people know we're freaking out, so while we might seem normal, in control, and calm, our insides are often a different story. It's ok to tell us we seem stabler or more confident- we'll appreciate you noticing. Just know that sometimes it might be an illusion, sometimes true one day but not the next. Acting like it's a result of something we didn't do is a double-blow, the first one being our own senses of failure for not being able to just ""tough it out"", ""grin and bear it"" etc.

Sometimes, just walking into a room by ourselves is the accomplishment of the day. Sometimes, we could lead a parade. Please, give us the credit for living with something so tough and managing to do anything. Please, just support us and help us, and listen to us. It's natural to get annoyed sometimes, but if you're annoyed, we're probably beating ourselves up because we're a self-critical lot. That's part of how we got this way, by being too self-aware.

We are trying to win the battle, but some days we just want to give up.",65,2012-11-02 04:41:56 EDT-0400

979,I begged my husband to kill me last night...,"The night started off fine. Me, my husband, and my kids went to a few art shows and then went to the circus. We had a great time. Then we came home, put the kids to bed, and watched a movie. That's the last thing I remember before ""waking up"" (I'm using quotes because apparently I never really went to sleep) in the hospital surrounded by my mom and my husband. I had had 4 half shots of Absolut while we were watching the movie and I started freaking out. I begged my husband to just kill me. Clearly I was having a panic attack but I also had started taking Lamictal that morning and I guess that mixed with the alcohol made me black out and panic. My husband called 911 and when they loaded me in to the ambulance I burst out and took off running. They were able to catch me and get me to the hospital. When my mom showed up I told her everything that I haven't been able to tell her. I told her about my anxiety, my OCD, my panic disorder and my anorexia. I don't remember any of this. All I remember is watching the movie. I feel like shit because although I have no memories of what happened my husband still does. He won't tell me everything I said because he thinks that its better that I don't know. He thinks its better that I don't remember. I'm not a regular drinker and I don't do any drugs or abuse my meds but they almost Marchman Acted me last night so I know I must've been pretty bad. I don't know if it was the meds mixed with the alcohol or if I just had a drunken panic attack. I know that you can't drink with xanax so I hadn't taken it. But I did take my celexa and I had taken the Lamictal earlier that day. Now I am embarrassed and my whole body hurts. Has anyone had anything similar to this happen? Should I continue taking the Lamictal (minus that Absolut of course)?

I had a bit of a panic attack.

I went inside the electronics store, and found an empty area, and just sat down in an office chair for about half an hour, until eventually somebody asked me if I needed help (in other words, ""Are you shoplifting?""), and I said, ""I'm sort of panicking,"" so that guy disappeared, and another guy came and asked me the same thing, and when I said I was panicking, he asked if there was a number he could call, I said no, and I said that I was waiting for the teenagers to shuffle out. He asked if he needed to call security on somebody, and I said, ""No, I just have an irrational fear of people my age,"" so he took me around to a goods elevator, swiped his card, and let me bypass an entire floor so that I could get out onto the street faster.

I was given the contact information yesterday and will hopefully set up a regular appointment soon.

993,"Finally becoming the boss of my anxiety. Slowly but surely. No medication, just an app/website and lots of self talk.","Hey reddit,

So I've posted here many times before, and usually I'm whinging about how horrible my anxiety has been and how I just can't control it. But today, I excited. I'm excited because I'm beginning to understand my mind, what triggers my anxiety, to spot when anxiety is approaching and deal with it, and just get a better quality of life in general. 

So it's all started with this TED talk. I'll post the link down the bottom for anyone interested in a very heartening talk. Basically in a nutshell, this woman had a head injury, was horribly depressed and on the brink of suicide, but created 'a game to heal her brain'. It works on the 4 types of resilience, scientifically proven to lengthen our lifespans. And she talks about this game she created, and I decided to give it a go. (it's called Superbetter. You can play online at superbetter.com, or download the app on iPhone) And within a week, I have been feeling better than I've felt in so long. I had seriously forgotten what it felt like to enjoy a day. I'd forgotten what it felt like to not give so much of my time and energy to those anxious thoughts. I now tell them, ""I know you're anxiety making these palptitations, or whatever else it may be at the time, and I'm in control here, it's my life, and I'm going to run it. BECAUSE I am awesome. I sweat and breathe awesome. And I tell that anxiety that it has no room next to my awesomeness. 

This is just one lesson this app has taught me. It has taught me so much more but I think this would become an essay! However, this app is designed to help people with anxiety, depression, eating disorders, and even things that arent so serious...and its even for people who just want a better quality out of life, to notice the little things and feel good about them, rather than all the huge big bad things.

So, everyday, I do my 3 power-ups (small things like walking around the block, or calling my aunty to say hi), I do my 3 quests (similar to power-ups but a little more involved) and I battle one bad-guy (your big issue). Need I mention who my bad guy is? But seriously, I think give this a shot. If you ever need an ally, I'm more than willing to help get you started :)

TL;DR. Found an app/website, superbetter.com, mentioned in this TED talk http://www.ted.com/talks/jane_mcgonigal_the_game_that_can_give_you_10_extra_years_of_life.html, and it's amazing. Good luck guys! :)",22,2012-11-02 19:33:45 EDT-0400
994,[Relaxing] What I've learned in the last year,"I've been going through Social Anxiety officially for over a year now. I'd say that although I've improved a lot over the past year, I still have my moments. I still get anxiety from going to parties or out to bars or clubs, or other social situations where I have to be present and contributing. Dates are killer for me- I still flake on dates probably 2/3 of the time. I have a huge fear of embarassing myself in public, specifically shitting myself or (to a lesser degree) throwing up. Of course the anxiety gives me nervous diarrhea and nausea, which makes a vicious spiral of increasing anxiety. 

After a year of therapy and warring with my anxieties I've developed a few tricks. I don't know how common these are but I'd say that I've developed all of them independently in myself. I'm not trying to say I'm original or anything, but I do want to share these because I feel like if I had known about and tried them sooner I would've saved myself from a lot of pain and anxiety.


* **Inch towards daylight.** I've noticed that my anxiety tends to come in waves of panic that ebb and flow and eventually peak before disappearing. So I tell myself ""Just last 15 more minutes. Then you can go home."" If the anxiety still isn't gone by then I tell myself ""Well you lasted that 15 minutes, you can do another 15."" Sometimes the anxiety gets worse and I do end up leaving, but I've found that by the time the 15 minutes have passed I'm calm and in the clear.

* **Stay busy.** Some of my worst triggers are standing in line or waiting for a test to start. But when the test finally starts, I focus on the exam and I'm fine. So whenever I'm at work with nothing to do and the panic sets in, I find something to do, even if it's something completely useless or extra. I'll help someone with whatever they're working on or figure out a better way of doing something. At parties, I tend to move around a lot. If I stay in one conversation too long, unless I'm really engrossed with the topic or who I'm talking to, I'll get bored and my mind will default to anxious thoughts. So I move around to something else, talk to new people or go back to other people I was talking to before- anything to keep me moving. Keeping busy keeps me out of my head and away from anxious thoughts.

* **Ignite curiosity.** This is something that I'm still developing. I recently had a huge battle with anxiety. I was supposed to meet up with this cute girl and her friends at a popular local brewery, and of course the whole morning and trip there I was having a panic attack. I was terrified of the whole situation, and no amount of telling myself that I'd be okay would help. I managed to park my car, and sat there for 20 minutes trying to convince myself to go inside. I almost left, but then a thought dawned on me. My anxious thoughts were always a foggy version of ""What if something horrible happens?"" but this time I thought, ""What if it all goes right? What if I go in there and everything is awesome and I have a great time with this girl?"" It wasn't enough to keep the anxious thoughts away, but for once something was pushing me *towards* what I wanted to do. And that was enough to get me to grit my teeth, get out of my car, and put one foot in front of the other.

Anxiety has taught me what it means to be crazy, to not be able to control your thoughts or emotions despite trying as hard as you possibly can. I can begin to understand why crazy people do what they do; somehow it seems sane even though logically they know it's not. It's taught me humility and empathy; willpower is not something that grows on trees, and people's failures of will are not simply because they're lazy. You don't go from 300 pounds of fat to 160 pounds of muscle overnight, and you don't go from lazy pothead to world's hardest worker overnight either. Willpower is cultivated. You work out every day to get stronger. You study every day to get smarter. You grit your teeth through laziness and fear every day to get more willpower. 

I, like the rest of reddit, am into sci-fi. I've always seen this anxiety as an invading force into my mind, taking over parts of my life and forcing me to do things that I don't really want to do. It's insidious and very convincing. It's been slowly invading me for probably 7 years now, and only a year ago did it reach a point where I realized what was going on.

This is a war, a long slow grind of pain and fear towards something better. Every day is a battle, some won and some lost. I'm cultivating the belief that even if the war goes bad for a while and I lose ground, it's not over until I say it's over. I'm not giving up until I'm dead or have completely mastered my anxiety. 

The most important thing that I've learned, is that you win this war in the day to day, the moment to moment. You never give ground easily- every second is a chance to think positively, every day has opportunities for you to break out of your shell. 

I may not be able to go on kickass dates with cute girls or crazy parties in grungy downtown warehouses-turned-apartments, but *some day I will be*. And sooner than I think.

I believe in myself.",1,2012-11-05 04:49:38 EST-0500
995,How do I tell my parents I need help if they don't believe anxiety is a real problem? ,"Hello there everyone,

I am 17 and I have been struggling with anxiety for as long as I remember. I never feel happy anymore because I'm always so worried about every little detail about my life. I second guess myself all the time in fear that I'm making a bad decision or I'm going to make myself look bad or embarrassing in front of people. I also feel really uneasy around people. I hate being in groups of people and I would rather just sit at home then be out with anyone. It even drives me to feeling sick sometimes to where I won't want to eat or want to do anything.
My boyfriend has expressed how worried he is about me and how he wants me to get help. My problem is that my parents don't believe problems like anxiety are real. They don't believe in getting therapy or medication to fix anxiety. I can't communicate on a personal level with my parents either and it's hard for me to tell them when I am having a problem. My boyfriend has told me that he will talk to them for me, but again, I'm too worried it'll upset them and then end up going down the road of telling me I need to grow out of this problem and there's really no medication for me to take that will help me because it's not real. I really don't feel okay with myself anymore and it's starting to throw me into a dark place. 

I just really need some advice on explaining to my parents that this really is a problem and that I'm very unhappy with my life because of it. Should I let my boyfriend talk to them? How can I tell them that I really NEED help with my anxiety? I just need some advice and thought you guys could possibly help! Thank you for reading.


EDIT: Wow! Thank you all so much! I didn't expect to get so much feedback. I definitely have a little better idea of what to do now. I'm still pretty scared about it myself that I'm figuring all this out and not really sure how the next few months are going to go. But thank you again to all of you. This means a lot! I'll definitely keep you guys updated once things start rolling after I talk to someone about it! ",5,2012-11-04 01:43:03 EST-0500
996,[Help / Advice] My anxiety keeps preventing me from starting school assignments.,"As a back story, I've dropped out of college on two separate occasions due to failing courses because of my anxiety and depression at the time. I am back for a third time, and I returned believing that I had the tools necessary to at least be able to get through school without too much anxiety.

I don't get this with doing nonschool work. I enjoy reading programming books on my own. I worked hard and have won music competitions by practicing for 8 hours a day for two years. I have a burning desire to work hard and understand my motivation for doing so.

My problem is that when it gets down to it and I have to sit down to work on a school assignment I get a sort of ""school work paralysis."" I stare at my computer screen, browse reddit/facebook/youtube/etc and just don't get anything done.

The things that hold me back stem from...

1. **Fear** of failing. Fear of not doing my best for the professors I admire. Fear of finding out that I am not great at something as I think I am.
2. **Struggle**: I am not used to having to study so much. It means I have to make lots of sacrifices and even if I do make those sacrifices I may not necessarily succeed. Was it worth it at all?
3. **Contentment**: Maybe living a modest life as a cashier at CVS or an IT guy would be okay for me. Is being content in this way holding me back?

If anyone has had a similar problem and has some strategies to overcome this I'd be much appreciative. Thank you fellow /r/Anxiety folks :)",7,2012-11-07 18:53:06 EST-0500
997,I know this isn't a good thing to use to cope with anxiety,"So I ran out of my anxiety meds on Saturday.  Sunday was ok.  But today the anxiety decided to kick off sometime before the end of work.  And it's been non-stop.  I ignore it, but it was factoring into everything I do and think.  

Thank god I'm to the point where I can recognize it.  If this was me two years ago, I wouldn't stand a chance.  But me now, I know what's going on.  Bad thing is with no meds until I get a refill from my doc, I have no hammer to beat the anxiety back, and none of my other methods of dealing with it are working except...

Alcohol.  

I just drank the last 3rd of my bottle of sour apple pucker straight on an empty stomach and except for some minor heartburn(I assume from the sugar in it), I feel great.  The anxiety is there, but it's like stuck... trapped behind a wall of fog, lost in a maze of sorts and can't get out.  I feel great... minus the tipsy part and moving to fast makes me lightheaded now.  

I tried calling a few people and no one picked up.  Decided it was time to go to bed and my father called me.  Got to talk to him and my grandmother.  I was so buzzed the entire time, but I think I was coherent.  Well now it's time to go to bed.  I hope everyone has a good night.  I know that alcohol is one of the worst ways to deal with anxiety let alone any problem, but I know for sure that for me it worked tonight to stop the anxiety from effecting any changes on me beyond the need to deal with the anxiety.  I feel great now.  Good night",19,2012-11-06 06:02:52 EST-0500
998,Something bad MIGHT have happened; there are indicators that it didn't and few that it did. But the anxiety is so intense it may as well have...,"I'm cross posting this story from twoxchromoses.... This past Friday night I went out with some coworkers after work for a few drinks and some bowling. I'd had a stressful week, including a break up with a fairly long term boyfriend, and a lot of work stress, and just wanted to relax. I had a few beers, which turned out to be too much. I got sick and started throwing up. One of my coworkers walked me to my car and put me in the backseat, where I passed out or fell asleep, not entirely sure which. I can't even remember if I locked the car. A woke up about 3 hours later and drove myself home. When I woke up, my clothes were on, I'm pretty sure even my belt was still on and buckled (it was off when I got home but I kind of remember taking it off myself, but I'm not completely sure.) I didn't think too much at the time, but as the day went on, I started wondering what happened and then noticed I had some vaginal discharge and irritation. I started to get really scared. The more upset I got, the more the pain increased. I finally called RAINN, and they directed me to the emergency room for an exam. I had to involve the police and have a full rape exam done. They found a few bruises on me, but I bruise easily so those may have been pre-existing or happened while I was drunk, and a very minor reddening around my vagina, but no tears or abrasions or anything conclusive. They swabbed for foreign DNA, but the police officer told me later that since there was no overt evidence and no suspects, it is likely the DNA tests will never be run. They have me antibiotics and the morning after pill and sent me home. I have only told one friend about this, and he keeps trying to convince me to let it go, and that it is likely nothing happened since I woke up with my clothes on, no obvious semen on me, and there were no tears or abrasions in my vagina. I just don't know what to do. I can't let it go. I'm so angry at myself for being careless, and angry at the people I was with for not looking out for me better, and just wishing I hadn't gone at all. My anxiety over the unknown is intense. I will just never know for certain. I had already been struggling with anxiety and depression issues before this and I'm feeling worse now. I'm considering checking into a mental health hospital as I've been having some suicidal thoughts. I just can't stop being angry at myself for being so stupid, and terrified of not knowing what happened. I keep trying to convince myself that nothing happened. I didn't take the morning after pill they gave me because I have this sick idea that if I end up pregnant, at least then I'll know, and I'll just have an abortion. I just need a little help right now, because I am having such strong anxiety attacks about this and I don't know what to do.",4,2012-11-05 03:26:48 EST-0500
999,DAE have anxiety about voting today?,"I had nightmares all last night that I was being dragged to the polling place.  The lines in my area area around an hour to two hours, and people haven't gotten out of work yet.  My anxiety is mostly centered around leaving the house AND being trapped somewhere.  I'm freaking the FUCK out.  I don't want to go and honestly don't care that much, but I'm afraid I'll get judged if I don't.  
The judging especially would come from my boyfriend, who I live with, so I can't just lie or not say anything.  We're very political, and I'm worse than him when it comes to bitching about politics.  I'm really not concerned about making a difference or not.  I should have gotten an absentee ballot, but I was afraid it wouldn't count.    Definitely will next time. 

Update:  I ended up not going to vote.  My state voted for the candidate I would have with an overwhelming majority.   I've decided to not bring up my voting whatsoever.  Because I was going to vote for Jill Stein (once again, NOT in a swing state) I figure saying that I didn't vote for Romney or Obama would be enough if I get asked.",6,2012-11-07 00:50:29 EST-0500
1000,The best advice I've received to cope with anxiety: guidance from my future self,"I'm a perfectionist and a lot of my anxiety (and depression) issues come out of not living up to my own standards. It leaves me paralyzed - better to do nothing than to try and fail. 

Someone left the following comment on my blog and it's been tremendously helpful, so I thought I'd share - 

""Imagine two different scenarios of yourself 10 years from now. One scenario in which you accepted your mistakes (everyone makes them!), forgave yourself (you didn’t murder anyone, you just were a little bit lost, so what!), and moved on and accomplished so much. In the other scenario, you never fully put the past behind you, you struggled with feelings of regret and shame, which caused unnecessary anxiety and made you just coast another 10 years and barely get by or worse.

So, keep envisioning your successful future self coming back in time, walking alongside you, encouraging you, and telling you to “relax, don’t get so worried, just get excited and passionate about your goals and have fun working hard towards them! Look where it got us!”

1001,Why I am unsubscribing.,"I joined this a while back because my life was starting to fill with anxiety. I posted a few times and it helped. Recently though, haven't had almost any anxiety.

I am going to unsubscribe because I don't need this subreddit anymore. I don't feel I have the anxiety I used to have. I still do worry about things to a small amount, but nothing to make me freak or have an attack.


If I do need you guys in the future I will subscribe, but right now unsubscribing is one of the things that will prove to myself that I don't need much help anymore. Thank you guys for helping when you did.

So I decided to go with my roommates and a few friends. So I drank one beer, then went to get a refill. There were some girls there, and I told them I was a freshman. They're like ""Yeah Freshies!"" and tried to take a picture with me, but someone jostled me and I accidently spilled beer on some sorority looking girl. She took my full beer cup, said I don't deserve a cup, and dumped the entire beer all over me. I left immediatley with my friend, smoked a bowl, and went to sleep.

First party I ever went to in my whole life, and I get humiliated like that. I feel like shit now. I am completely miserable here at college. I hate partying, and I don't know how I'm going to get along here. College just feels like high school all over again here. I'm depressed as hell. I need help",26,2012-08-26 20:22:33 EDT-0400
1011,"After five years ""clean,"" I had a panic attack . . . at work.  I feel lost.  Advice, comfort, help—please.","It happened Saturday afternoon.  

No warning, no trigger—*my life isn't even stressful right now*—just BAM.  Lightheaded, nauseated, falling—I sat down, fast, and couldn't move.  

It had been so long since I'd had to deal with this, I didn't even recognise what was happening at first.  I felt tight, dizzy, confused, nervous.  And then the panic bloomed inside of me and my heart twisted and *I knew.*

*No, no, not again.*  

The realisation made it worse.

I was with a coworker when it hit, and I think I scared him.  I didn't mean to.  He was calm, professional, concerned.  He kept talking, asking questions, keeping an eye on me.  He didn't know what was happening at first either; I think we figured it out together.  He hit all the questions you're supposed to ask when giving care to someone who may lose consciousness, questions to ask while you're waiting for the ambulance to arrive:  *are you taking any medication right now?  do you have any allergies?  what did you eat today?*

The manager for the day (my close friend, thank goodness) found us half an hour later—me sitting frozen, eyes closed, terrified and shaking; him sitting in a chair across from me, talking quietly and trying to help.  He explained quickly, briefly, ""I think she's having a panic attack.""

They helped me move from the chair (so high up, dizzingly high) to the floor.  I convinced them not to call 911 (I'm not sure how; I couldn't have been *very* convincing—the effort of talking was almost too much to bother).  

My friend sat on the floor next to me.  ""I'm going to stay right here until you're okay.""  He offered me his hand, and I clutched it and tried to keep the world from spinning, the walls from falling in.

It crested, and began to fade.  Breathing started to come easier.  Eventually, I could—*almost*—laugh without hyperventilating.

**But that was three days ago, and the tight knot of nervousness hasn't gone away.**  

I dread another attack, and I'm trying to fight back the feeling.  I'm off caffeine (no worries of withdrawal; I only drink coffee or pop occasionally to begin with), I'm trying to process, I give myself dedicated time to relax—but the knot is still there, and my worries about its presence are only feeding it.

I don't know why this is happening again.  I'd forgotten what it was like to live with this shadow in my life, and I don't think I can bear it.

1015,[Relaxing] My tips and tricks towards a better life,"Hey there. I've come a long way with my anxiety and depression, and I decided to NOT tell about my story, but rather the way I handle things and make them better. These have helped me over the years with my stuff, hopefully it helps you too. Try them, no matter how silly they feel. It won't hurt you. :)

**1. Take control**
If you sometimes have worse days, sometimes better days, try to take a break on one of the better days. Take ONE of your problems, put all the other things aside, and try to think the problem rationally. Why is the problem such a big deal? What causes it? When did it start? Did something happen in your life back then? Can you find any connections to anything in your life? List these things, clarify the problem to the extent. Trust me, even though it might make the rest of the day shitty, it will give you more control over the situation. When you feel like your in charge, you will definitely feel better. Be bigger than your problem. It's YOUR problem, so it should be YOU in charge, not the other way around.

**2. Find things that make you happy**
I love comedy films and series, so I watch them. A LOT. I also like singing, and whenever my girlfriend isn't home, I sing my heart out. Do that. Find things that make you happy and feel warm inside, and do those things when you feel down. Forget about all your worries, just delve deep into the happy things. It won't make the problems go away, but it gives you more happiness than the problem will, and that's what counts, if you can't have actual control over the situation.

**3. Get help, and get it early**
Don't crawl into a mental fetus position. Go out and talk to friends or family. If the problem is related to your friends / parents / relatives, go and talk to them, even though it feels difficult and you make them cry. Talk, and don't stop before you're finished. If you need, get a psychologist, psychiatrist or a psychotherapist, and talk about your problems. Never be afraid to talk. If you're scared to go to the mental care, DON'T. FOR F*S SAKE DON'T. It's the most ridiculous thing you can do to yourself. Just go and get help.

**4. Don't get anxious over religion**
I know this may hurt some people, but if you have problems with your religious views, try to remember this: no one knows the truth. Ever wondered what happens after we die? Nobody knows for sure. No one has ever come back to tell us. These are things we have no control over. There is going to be enough time to wonder about these, but if you have any other problems in your life, concentrate on them first. Don't get hurt by other people's views, no matter how much they debate over the Bible or the Kuran. Everybody has their own views over these things, and I think there's no two people that have exactly similar thoughts about religion or afterlife. It's your religion, and you don't have to decide just yet.

**5. Trust future**
No matter how bad you feel now, you will get better. There will be better days, and they will keep getting better until you are the king of yourself. You cannot change the present, but you damn well can change the future.

Of course, there's things that cannot be handled in a straight-forward fashion. Those things need professional help. But trust me, it will get better.",6,2012-08-25 22:23:42 EDT-0400

1021,Can't even go to school anymore.,Im currently a junior in high school. Since I can remember ive always had fits about going to school and always had bad attendance and faked sick to get out of going.(I missed 45 days last school year.) I always will panic the nights before and in the morning and while i'm there i'm just socially anxious all over. It's gotten particularly bad this year. I missed the first day of school because my attack was so overwhelming in the morning. I have to be at school in 6 hours but I can't even sleep because of how panicky I am.

1023,So I tried a college fraternity rush event.,"I try to be open minded and let my mind speak. I'm okay doing that with 1 on 1 or with two or three people at a time. But when it comes to any groups more than 4 people, I shut myself down, and I feel anxious and horrible.

So today, I went to a fraternity rush event, a BBQ, to practice talking to people, a lot of people. At first, going 1 on 1 or 2 with a couple brothers there was okay. But when big groups started to show up and form their own circles, I felt left out. I tried to squeeze myself into a group, but it just felt weird standing with groups of strangers that I don't know.

So after ~20 mins wandering around by myself feeling like crap, hating myself, hating my life, I walked out of the BBQ. 

I learned that my social anxiety issue is a lot bigger than I thought. Oh well. I do plan on going to another rushing event and try again.",2,2012-08-23 07:02:37 EDT-0400

1033,"A bit of good news I wanted to share with the wonderful, helpful people of this subreddit.","A few weeks back, I posted a story about an experience I had that left me pretty upset.  I felt inspired by the people who responded to finally attempt to make some positive changes in my life.  I began to realize that my irrational thoughts that have plagued me for the past 11 years were only worsening as I progress through a particularly stressful and important time in my life.  I will be graduating from university at the end of this year, and my anxiety and depression have become absolutely crushing as this part of my life comes to a close.

Anyway, I finally sought out a therapist.  I first saw a psychologist at my school who recommended I see a psychiatrist through my health care provider.  I did so, and first completed an ""intake"" session.  The doctor diagnosed me with GAD, dysthymia, and episodes of major depression (double depression).  I've taken an abnormal psychology class.  I know that double depression is a pretty difficult beast to overcome.  But instead of ducking out of pursuing help like I normally would, I made the next appointment.  The second psychiatrist I saw prescribed 150 mg Wellbutrin for the first week, then 300 mg thereafter (which I started a few days ago).  I also enrolled in a class on overcoming depression, as well as one for anxiety.  I'm trying to muster the motivation to begin journaling.

It's a strange experience when you begin to actually *feel* your mood.  I don't really know how to explain it, but I am beginning to feel my mood change.  Before this, I never really knew what a ""mood"" felt like.  I only knew utter complacency, anger, and sadness for a very long time.  Actually feeling like I want to wake up in the morning, go on walks, laugh, play with my kitten... something other than lay in bed and sleep for 15+ hours, or finding an excuse to nap at 3PM, sleep until 9PM, then go to bed again at midnight.  I'm obviously only at the beginning stages of getting better, but even small changes are noticeable after coming from the place I was in.

I still have the occasional anxious thought, especially when in crowded places like public transportation ('the guy in the seat behind me has a gun! we're going to crash and die!') or in class.  But I have been learning the practical skills for coping with my irrational thoughts, and it's been really helpful in bringing myself down from an elevated state of anxiety.

Thank you so much /r/anxiety. I doubt I would have sought help without the insightful posts and comments here.

If anyone wants to ask me anything about therapy or anything else, feel free to comment or PM me.

Quick edit:  I forgot to add the thing I was most excited about!  I talked to TWO people today.  That may not seem like a big deal to most, but I would have never done that before.

1037,[Help] I just had a panic attack and I think I might be going insane.,"Hi guys. I'm 23 year old Female who works a high stress retail job that is very demanding. I am generally very high strung and am not good at coping. I reside in the US, and I have pretty good insurance. 

My anxiety is always there. It's a companion I haven't been able to shake for a long time, but now there is an elephant in the room and I want him to leave. On Friday night, I got so blackout drunk that apparently I was leaning over my toilet hysterically crying about not wanting to die. I remember snippets, but what really worries me is how adamant I was about not wanting to die.

Post hangover all I feel is like there's a small vibration in the back of my mind and when it snaps, I am going to go insane. I am so paranoid about becoming crazy or schizophrenic that I had a horrible panic attack while driving home this evening from work. I felt like I was tripping. I couldn't concentrate and I called my boyfriend in hysterics. After I realized I was having a panic attack and not going insane, I calmed down a bit. I am prescribed generic Xanax and took .25mg to be able to sit down and coherently type this. The vibration is gone and I feel normal again. 

Work and school I think are my biggest triggers, but so are my lack of friends. I really don't know what to do. I have tried breathing exercises and attempted meditation. I also bought a bike to ride around to clear my head. I just honestly don't want to go insane at 23. I'm leaning toward seeing a therapist through my insurance because I am getting to the point where I am unable to function properly. 

So, does anyone else ever feel like this? Am I going insane?",19,2012-11-12 03:55:00 EST-0500

Fast forward to last night. She starts panicking. She told me she was laying in bed for hours in terror about this.  She just called me and told me that she's purposely going to stay at work until 9pm tonight so she doesn't have to go.

I said we could just not go, that we didn't even have to go at all anymore if she was that worried.  I explained that this guy was just trying to be nice, helping her out.  But no - she insists that every person there now knows who she is and knows that she's a **bad gamer with bad strategy.**

Also, she absolutely refuses to see any doctor about this problem, because she says that the doctor will think she's making all of it up.

Yet here I am, unable to fall asleep. Went to bed at 10pm tonight, so I gave myself plenty of time. This morning I woke up at 7am and went running/walking for a total of about an hour so it's not like I'm just flat out not tired.

This happened last week as well, when I started work. Monday went flawlessly, fell asleep the night before and it was great. Tuesday? About an hour of sleep. I even took NyQuil to help me fall asleep, but it didn't have any affect. My heart was pounding too hard the whole night. 

Wednesday it started again the moment I laid down to go to sleep. Instead I went downstairs on the couch and I guess sort of tricked my mind. I was able to get some sleep. The rest of the week went fine.

So when I couldn't sleep today either, I went downstairs on the couch (TV on and real quiet like last time), but this time nothing happened. And now I'm here.

I get this all the time when I need to get up the next morning, regardless of what it's for. Happened when I had to interview for my current job, happened when I went job counseling at my university over the summer (nothing even stressful about that, but I had to catch an early bus).

I don't know what to do. I took some valerian root and melatonin to help me sleep but they don't do anything. I just started this job so I don't have insurance yet, nor can I just take a sick day and go to a therapist or something. My hours are such that I can't go before or after work really.

But I feel like this last week or so, I've made some huge progress in my fight..
One of my phobias is that when my boyfriend leaves in the car , or on a trip, or anywhere without me, something bad will happen to either him or me, and I'll be helpless against it. I think about past experiences and imagine him going to jail for something for a very long time, and me not knowing what to do, or that he'll get into a car accident and die because he's kind of a sketchy driver and loves to be on his phone. (rational and irrational fears).
Anyway... He's on a 4 day music festival/camping trip ( I was supposed to go too, but things came up ) and I'm on day 2 by myself. 
I cried like a baby when I said goodbye to him. 
But so far, I've gotten through 2 panic attacks caused by 2 different things (intense nausea/vomiting and getting called the worst waitress a customer had seen in her life... In front of the manager of my new job ) all by myself without screaming or hyperventilating or anything too bad, just some mad anxiety. 
I kept wishing he was there because he would know what to do, but I sucked it up and did what I could, which was enough to satisfy my mind apparently. 
I even got through a REALLY bad one induced by benadryl, that made me super nauseous, super paranoid and pretty irrational.

1054,"The best I've felt in a long, long time ","This past weekend I took a trip from Los Angeles up to Portland, where I'll be moving in a couple of weeks to go to culinary school. The last time I made that trip, just under three months ago, I was absolutely miserable the entire time. I almost broke down completely on the plane ride, could hardly eat at all for the two days I was there, and my anxiety made me shake it like a Polaroid constantly, in the immortal words of Mr. Andre 3000. 

Before I left on Friday, I was incredibly anxious. I needed to take an entrance exam, finish up financial aid paperwork, and get fitted for a chef's uniform all just an hour and a half after landing. It seemed so overwhelming and I really wasn't sure I'd be able to deal. But surprisingly, I was completely fine. 

Barely even a twinge of anxiety in the security line and in the crowded rush of people in the terminal. No horrible nausea or claustrophobia on the plane, and when I got up I didn't worry about my legs giving way beneath me. I made it through all the stuff I had to do at my school, smiling and talking naturally to everyone without stumbling around or feeling as though I was wearing a cheap mask. For once, I let myself be *really* happy without thinking about whether or not it's ""realistic"" to feel that way or if I ""deserve"" it. 

I've been on an SSRI (Lexapro) for about three and a half months now, and the difference has been like night and day. I was so afraid of getting on medication (what if there are horrible side effects? what if it destroys my personality? what if it makes my head fall off? blah blah blah), but I'm so glad I finally did. 

**Sorry for the wall of text, but I just wanted to let everyone on here know that even if you've tried a million things already, don't give up. I know that I'll probably have to work with and around my anxiety issues for the rest of my life, but that's okay.

1060,Stop wishing for your legs back: anxiety and acceptance,"I just got done meditating, and I had a realization about my anxiety, and anxiety in general. I understand each of us has our own unique life and experience with anxiety; my intent is not to prescribe some miracle solution to anxiety for everyone, though I believe this is one powerful tool and attitude toward gaining ultimate peace.

Here's an analogy to explain this realization. If a person loses both their legs, they are probably going to be very bummed about  it. They could spend the rest of their lives in sorrow wishing they had both their legs back. But the fact is, they're never gunna get the things back (save for possibly cyborg legs in the distant future... which would be pretty awesome)!  On the other hand, if they accept this reality, that their legs are long gone, they can live with this dilemma, but still move on to enjoy all the wonderful things that life has to offer. Case in point: I went to high school with a guy that got drunk and passed out on some train tracks. He lost both legs and an arm. To this day, this guy is one of the happiest guys I've ever met. His legs and arm are not conditions for him to be happy.


With this line of thinking, many of us have set a condition for us to be happy: we will be happy once we get our peace back, and until we do, life sucks! Stop fighting anxiety. Stop wishing for your legs back. The real issue is not the anxiety, it's the judgement of the anxiety that perpetuates it. It's feeling the slightest bit of tension (which is totally human), and then your mind making it 10x worse because ""I shouldn't feel this way.""


The funny thing is, once you adopt an attitude of acceptance, your anxiety tends to disappear. But if you go into it with an attitude of, ""I accept this feeling, now why won't it go away!"", it's ineffective. Learn to accept anxiety like an old friend every time it arrives. Attacking the root of anxiety is to wholeheartedly accept it. Trying to consciously will acceptance into your life isn't very effective (at least in my experience), and for that, I highly recommend checking out /r/meditation.",12,2012-06-03 00:38:28 EDT-0400

Before I can even ponder an idea it flys out of my mouth. I can cover this with (awkward) humor most of the time, but given that I work in healthcare, even a single slip up can make me sound a lot dumber than I am. Recently, one of the residents at the facility I work in was having a minor medical issue. In reporting this to the nurse, I listed off a complete list of symptoms... that another resident was displaying. I corrected myself and no harm was done, but I could not stop thinking about that single mistake for the next two days. I literally could not sleep because I couldn't distract myself from the anxiety.

So, my question is, does anybody else do this? What are some of your coping strategies if you do?",6,2012-06-03 15:41:53 EDT-0400

It takes a tremendous amount of focus and energy for me to even momentarily feel connected to my surroundings. I'll suddenly realize that there are trees surrounding me, beautiful clouds in the sky, the warmth of the sun. Because of this, I think I have anxiety to blame for this ""zoned-out"" feeling that I experience daily.

I am asking for everyone else's feelings that they experience day-today, be it a face-value feeling like ""I feel like I think too fast,"" or ""My nervous tics cause me to lose my mind on a daily basis.""

1069,I hate myself right now.,"I think this is the best subreddit to talk about this because I know you guys will understand. 

I just got back from an attempted gastroscopy. Basically I have been having stomach issues since last October and I've done blood tests, I've done ultrasounds, the one where you have to drink barium and they do like an xray thing... Nothing comes up. Or well basically it is not an ulcer. 

Gastroscopy is when they stick a camera down your throat. Now I'm not actually particularly afraid of the process because I just want to feel better, but what I am extremely afraid of is being sedated. I don't like the feeling, I don't like how I feel afterwards... It's almost a phobia. They have another option where they spray this stuff down your throat to numb the gag reflex. Now what I *didn't* know was that it would feel like my throat was swelling up and that I could not swallow(I was swallowing but I couldn't 'feel' it). This is where it all went downhill. I started to hyperventilate, and the doctor lost his patience with me and went to sit in the corner. Thankfully the nurse was very good and she escorted me to another room to calm down and to think over if I wanted to go through with it. My throat felt like I had a horrible sore throat by this time and the spray/liquid stuff didn't sit well. I threw up. 

I couldn't do it. I left. 

I feel so fucking disappointed in myself. I hate this anxiety. I hate that I feel like I don't have any options about my stomach... wtf else are they going to do? I don't want to be under anesthesia because even the thought of that is a bit triggering. 

How do you guys deal with medical procedures? Also how the heck are you supposed to deal with doctors that have no sympathy for mental health? He kept telling me I just need to 'calm down'. I know most of you guys will understand that that is the most useless thing to say to someone with anxiety and under a panic attack.

1072,"[Help] College student, trying to find ways to work through my anxiety over the summer","I had really horrendously bad anxiety issues at the beginning of this school year. Like I would skip lectures and stuff because I felt like people were staring at me all the time and it freaked me out. I worked through it eventually, after a lot of reading and meditation and encouragement. But I feel like if I sit at my parent's house over the summer I'll relapse and have to deal with that all over again. So I want to do something during the summer that will keep me on my  toes mentally, I guess?

Things I've thought about so far:

I live in Washington DC, so maybe I could hang out around monuments and **museums**. I'm not about to randomly accost tourists on the street though... so maybe I could work as a guide?

I thought about a **customer service** job of some sort, but I feel like in those sorts of jobs you get a lot of negative people and that would set me back.

I've spent a lot of time in **bookstores** reading, but [I'm scared of talking to people in bookstores because this is what I feel like people who are reading think] as opposed to ""Hey I'm reading something you like you should ask me about it"".

I applied to work at a school with small **children** because kids are nice to you, and even when they're mean they're not mean in such a way that triggers my anxiety.

1073,"[HELP] I really want to go back to school, but I just can't fail again... ","Hey /r/Anxiety. I just found out you exist and I love you for it. 

About five years ago, after graduating high school, I went to my local community college. I signed up for four classes, picking them out carefully, with a schedule I could keep. As soon as I got to my first class... A huge panic attack. I couldn't do it. Everyone was looking, watching, judging... So I hid myself in the very back corner. I wouldn't other anyone there, even the teacher. I made myself invisible. 

The thing with being invisible is... No one tends to notice when you're gone. I skipped a day, once, thinking, oh what does it matter. I'll just take this one day off. It'll get better tomorrow. 

It didn't. It snowballed. I missed more and more school until I either failed or dropped out of all my classes. This happened four times, in four different semesters, in three years. 

I've thrown away hundred, probably thousands of dollars. It's been two years, and I've been self employed during that time. I have a completely flexible schedule and I know a degree will help me. But i am downright *terrified* of going back... Of everything happening all over again, of wasting all that time and money, to have my self esteem completely smashed all over again.

1081,Coffee Therapy.,"Heya Reddit, I sent this to some friends and they suggested that I post this here.  I hope it helps!

A few years ago I started having some problems with anxiety.  Things have improved slowly but steadily until now, at which point I would probably rate my anxiety as ""low"" rather than where it started as ""crushing"".

Here's something which has helped in my recovery.

I have found that it's useful to distinguish physical sensation from my emotional state.  The best example I've come up with is the feeling you get when you drink coffee.

Originally when all of this started, I quit drinking coffee, because whenever I drank coffee I would feel anxious.  I've realized over time that it wasn't really the coffee which was causing me to become anxious.  Caffeine creates the physical sensation in my body of a slightly tightened chest, a fluttering in my stomach, enhanced mental acuity, and a slightly modified mental perception of what's going on.

These physical sensations are very similar to those I feel when I am in an anxious state of mind, and so originally whenever I felt these sensations my mind would interpret them as feelings which required an anxiety response and would lead to an anxious state of mind, which would sometimes lead to panic attacks.  Now, when I drink coffee and feel these things I simply make myself mindful that these physical sensations DO NOT require an emotional response.  They're simply caused by the effect of a drug on my body, and the drugs effect of increased synaptic activity in my thinkputty.

Immediately, my anxiety response disappears and I can enjoy the caffeine buzz as I used to before all of this business started.

Every cup of coffee is a therapy session, and it has helped me make my way back to some level of normalcy.  

I started with a quarter cup of coffee per day and slowly worked my way up.  Now I drink about a cup a day, which is generally all I want anyway.

Sometimes, I'll drink a shitload of coffee.  I view it as a personal challenge.  Come on caffeine, you dirty sonofabitch.  Let's see what you got!

I've had four cups this morning and I'm about to vibrate into another dimension, but no anxiety thus far.",33,2012-12-08 20:21:39 EST-0500

1083,Where is my Girlfriend?!,"I'm sitting at my computer at work right now, and my anxiety is through the roof. I haven't gotten a text or call from my girlfriend since 9:30 this morning (it's currently 4PM). This is extremely odd considering we're always texting eachother and communicating. She knows I have issues with anxiety. But ironically, she is the biggest trigger if I don't know she's okay. She had a final today at 10:30, and that's all she had to do. We couldn't afford the parking permit, so she's been walking in the mornings, which isn't far, but we're in Kansas City, and I'm always worrying about the worst that could happen to her. I love her so much, which is why I worry about her. I don't know what to do. I know I'm going to go home and there will be a reasonable explanation for this, but that thought doesn't help a bit. This is just me venting. Sorry if this is pointless.

UPDATE: She was fine. She never looked at her phone the whole day, then she took a long nap apparently. She apologized and everything, and so did I, knowing it's not her fault. We're very communicative. She understands that sometimes I need to get a hold of her or I'm gonna explode.

1086,You feel how you think.,"It is a basic CBT teaching I believe. Anyway with this kind of logic, it can give one a different understanding on what anxiety is. I know anxiety can be very hard to control, like taming a tiger ;)

Anyway... Anxiety normally starts with a certain thought. Once you accept that thought as truth, you start creating even more relevant thoughts around that thought. So, then our subconscious starts to feel the energy of our thoughts, sorta like when you watch a action movie and you get this whole rush. Sometimes you even feel like your in that movie. And I know with anxiety it can be really hard to focus into movies... so straight to my point.

When I say think of smiling. Just think about nothing but smiling :D. Feel it, that smile. lol. You just created that emotion with your thoughts.

We are basically gods of our own thoughts, artist we are all. Eventually the anxiety gets so bad, we forget that we are the painters of our minds. So our minds begin to rule us and take over. We basically become tools of our minds. And because of the internet, our minds tend to develop the habbit of being rather active to the fast pacedness of it.

I was having this really hard day today, feeling absolutely foggy and unhappy. I dont want to use the word depressed, because once I accept it as depression it grows.

When I feel cruddy like this, a part of me say's ""Dont surf the net, simplify and try to control your thinking"". Well today I actually listened to that, so I sat, relaxed, Meditated sorta. Because it was hard to relax, I told my self (Smile, relax, tune out the world, and just be). I trusted that and stopped thinking other stuff, I just drifted off with a smile on my face.

When I opened my eyes, the energy of my room felt much more amplified, and I felt good. So I am here now to tell about it. 

**TL;DR** Felt anxious/crappy, stopped what I was doing, consciously changed my thoughts to simple positive ones, and drifted off without thinking twice. I now feel much better :)",2,2012-12-08 03:58:47 EST-0500

1090,Anxiety and the use of marijuana ,"I am a [21M] junior in college and have been dealing with anxiety and mild OCD since I was about a sophomore in high school. I began by going to a therapist to talk about the issues I was having for about a 6 month period. After all was said and done I got diagnosed with mild OCD/GAD; having compulsive thoughts and letting little things bother me and not able to stop thinking about it in my head. Essentially, my thoughts get stuck in a constant loop and begin to overwhelm me. I got put on Citalopram (brand name is Celexa). I've been taking that everyday for a couple of years now. It has seemed to work relatively well. However, with school getting harder and harder (I am a BS Biochemistry and BS Chemistry major) I have noticed my anxiety getting worse at times. Just this year, I've gone into a test feeling very confident on the material and when I get the test I just blank and can't recall much of anything. This is the first time that has ever happened to me. So to my point; I've always smoked weed throughout high school and still do now. I didn't smoke very much 9th-12th grade because I played year round baseball and that basically consumed my life. But this year I've gotten into a routine for about the past 8 months of smoking every night. I never do during the day or when I have work I need to get done. It is simply my way of ending my day and helping me relax and not stress and not have compulsive thoughts of schoolwork or anything that may be causing me stress at the time. Is it possible that me ""self medicating"" is starting to have more of a negative effect and causing increased anxiety without me realizing. I feel like my anxiety is progressively getting worse but I am not sure if it is from chronic marijuana use or if my medicine isn't right for me or what. Has anyone else tried smoking marijuana to help cope with anxiety? 

Sub note: I have never had an anxiety/panic attack or any bad experience whatsoever after smoking. I have had two mild panic attacks in my life but both times when completely sober and never near a time I had recently smoked. ",30,2012-12-09 22:39:44 EST-0500
1091,Anxiety controls my life.,"I don't know what's going on in my head. It's as if my fight or flight response never turns off. I don't have anything in my life to worry about. I've tried meds but I hate dependence and I'm trying to be straight edge. I used to smoke, drink, and live a sedentary life style. I've quit all those things now. But from the moment I wake up it feels like impending doom. The only solution I know of is to go on a walk/run/job and keep going until I'm absolutely exhausted and can't worry anymore. And then my mind is clear and I feel normal again until bedtime, where the feeling of impending doom comes back. Sometimes I'm laying there and I get this sensation that moves up my esophagus that makes me jolt up. It is a terrifying feeling. It's a miracle I fall asleep every night.

1092,Doc says I have anxiety - don't believe him.,"All began about 2 months ago, started getting heart palps and tightness in my right arm.  Long story short, had all the heart things done and apparently my heart is 100% fine.

Now I'm not fit, 6ft and about 120kgs (264 pounds).  Over the last two years I have slowly put on weight due to an average diet and botched ankle surgery however I am on a diet and slowly losing it.

I used to smoke a pack a day however quit cold turkey just over a month ago.

Now this week especially I have stuck to the diet and the last two days were the best I've felt in almost two months.

Today I ate especially healthy - complex carb breakfast and salad with turkey for lunch.

Then suddenly around 4:00pm today the following happened over a 30 - 45 minute period:

1.  Major pressure in my head
2.  Left side of Jaw and left ear went numb
3.  Muscle spasms and twitches in my calves and forearms
4.  Numbness and tingling in my right forearm and on and off for lower left leg.
5.  Asthma/shortness of breath
6.  Heart Palpitations
7.  Lost all colour in my hands and face
8.  Hands were trembling

The entire time I thought I was going to die.  Anyways, rushed off home and it settled after about an hour and a half.  Currently 8:00pm and I feel fatigued, still have some head pressure and have slight asthma (ventilan has helped).

Now, my Doctor says this is all due to Anxiety.  I have no more stress in my life then I normally experience, in fact, it’s winding down for Christmas and if anything I should be more relaxed.  I am getting checked for diabetes even though the Doc says chances are extremely low.  Not sure if I should at the very least see a neurologist or organise some form of CT scan.

Someone please tell me they have experienced similar symptoms during a single episode as I did today?  Going kind of nuts here.

Edit:  Apologies I didn't reply sooner, on Australian time here and ended up going back to the hospital after another similar episode yesterday.  Was busy at the hospital so by the time I was in a bed all the above symptoms had gone (bar a headache and heavy chest), was monitored for 7 hours though and nothing was found.

In short.... starting to believe the doc! (pending some tests).

Thanks for all the responses, this is a great community.  Will try to answer a some of the questions now.

1093,"[Rant] I constantly worry I may have acted in an inappropriate way, or that I have hurt someone's feelings. I think my BC/hormones may be the problem.","I am 17F, and in recent months I feel as if I've lost control of my anxiety.
For example, today my boyfriend came over and it was the first time I'd seen him in a while because I had been ill, and he said he'd missed me and I said I'd missed him and we really had a wonderful day, just our usual good time. However, as soon as he goes out the door I start worrying ""Oh god, I should have acted more excited to see him"" ""Why did I say x instead of saying y"" ""I hope I didn't hurt his feelings when I said z"" I end up getting upset and worrying until I see him again. 

I've *always* been an anxious person and I've been to several doctors and therapists, I've tried hypnotherapy as a last-resort, I've even tried changing my diet. There's a pretty extensive history of mental illness on my Father's side of the family, and he's suffering from things he can't admit to.

I have a feeling that my birth control is behind my heightened anxiety, often when I would take my periods I would become a total wreck for a week and they'd be very painful so I decided to start taking Cerazette and it went just great up until the start of this year, when periods became very irregular. I would spot for anywhere up to 8 weeks. The only reason I stayed on them was because I thought ""well 6-8 weeks of light spotting with no pain whatsoever certainly beats 2 weeks of vomiting and bleeding through pads"" For some of the time I was spotting I would be overly sensitive, irrational, and emotional. But now it's ALL the time I'm spotting/bleeding and it's tiring me out. I do a good job of hiding it when I'm around people but occasionally I can't and I end up having a cry, luckily I have an understanding boyfriend and he's a very calm person. I'm on my last pack of tablets and as soon as those are finished I will no longer be taking them as I'm looking into other methods of birth control in the hopes that I'll get back to my ""normal"" still anxious, but less so, self.

**TLDR; My birth control is turning me into an irrational person who can't cope with saying potentially the ""wrong"" thing and I've just had enough of it, I'm sick of not being able to ""relax"" and I'm sick of not being able to enjoy things.**",5,2012-12-09 04:43:27 EST-0500

Pretty much me to the 10th degree. I felt completely reassured by this that nothing is ACTUALLY wrong with me.. it's my thoughts doing this to me and I CAN talk myself out of it if I let myself. It will go away if I STOP WORRYING about things and if I don't let myself be overwhelmed if & when the physical signs of anxiety/panic start. (aka fight or flight symptoms beginning.)    

So after watching that yesterday, I was completely fine managing my anxiousness even though I was exhausted and not feeling too great because I partied and stayed up too late the night before. I was doing fine until I went to Safeway. Stupid tiny things started really frustrating me..(ie. not feeling good, feeling tired, headache, having to walk super far, not being able to find the wine my friend asked me to get for her fast.. ect.).. then I got stupid dizzy tunnel vision because I let my frustration get to me. So tunnel vision then escalated to me worrying and not being able to catch a full breath. When I feel like I can't catch a full breath, it makes me try to correct that feeling so I'm continuously taking deep breaths trying to get that ""full refreshing breath"" feeling which only makes things worse and my throat becomes tight, chest becomes stiff as a rock and I start mildly hyperventilating. Mild hyperventilation makes my thoughts race harder and my worrying escalates to worrying that I'm going to faint in the store, have a heart attack or have some kind of crazy meltdown in front of ppl.

I dizzily & frantically walk to the check out line where I'm trying SOOO hard to play it off.. but in all actuality I'm breathing wayy too heavily, clearing my throat repeatedly and I'm digging through my purse trying to look for a chapstick to distract myself. People get in line behind me. Finally its the person in front of me's turn to pay. 

He's counting his money and change and it's taking forever. My frustration SUPER getting to me.. my mind is racing and heart is beating incredibly hard. At this point I turn around and see that one of the girls behind me is staring at me. I immediately think ""she thinks I'm crazy, she notices me freaking out, she thinks I'm on drugs, she thinks I stole something... blah blah blah."" I'm borderline losing it. ""Keep it together,"" I tel myself.

The guy ends up not having enough money to pay. He says.. okay I'll just put it back. I'm suuuper frustrated and at this point can barely see straight. I try to play it cool though and I ask ""how much are you short?"" shakily. ""70 cents,"" he responds. I pull out a dollar and hand it to him. He thanks me over and over and over and the check out lady said ""Aww thats so nice of you. Thanks for doing that!"" It doesn't make me feel better. ""Yeah, yeah, now fucking cash me the fuck out so I can get the fuck OUT OF HERE"" is what I'm thinking to myself.

The girl cashes me out. I remember thinking I was going to black out. I shake my head and blow air harshly though pursed lips..  like blowing a raspberry with no tounge (i don't know why but it helps me shake and wake my head/face up and makes me feel a little more in control). I walk out of the store. I sit in my car. I lock my door. Breeeeeeathe, just breeeeeeathe. I regain a little sense of normality. I drive to my friends house nervously. I get there. I'm shaken up, but I' start drinking some beers and hanging out with friends, completely disappears.

Today, I was perfectly fine until I got frustrated once again. My computer and iphone started crapping out and both were taking FOREVER to load a song my dad wanted me to play on his new speakers, I also kept thinking I needed to hurry and go shower and get ready because theres a party I'm supposed to attend tonight, I had to go pee, my dog wanted me to take her outside, my mom cooked spaghetti and wanted me to eat some. The freaking speakers were blaring loud music and my ipod and computer were taking forever and so BOOM; I get dizzy, derealization sets in and the uncomfortable breathing starts. I go upstairs in my room. I put my phone on my bed. take off my pants. Go to look for my phone because I hear it vibrate. I can't find it anywhere. I feel myself becoming SUPER frustrated. I find my phone but can't shake the feelings completely.. which brings me here, typing this, right now. Breathing is better now. Vision and dizziness still suck.. but once I stop looking at the screen and hop in the shower, I'm hoping that will change.

I hope you are all having a good day /r/anxiety folks. I feel for you and love you all. I hear my parents kissing each other in the room next to mine which means it's definitely time for me to leave the room and get in the shower. Take care and wish me luck! :)",2,2012-12-09 07:02:06 EST-0500

1105,I'm going to kill myself tonight. I tried reaching out for help for sexual trauma and I got a bunch of people blaming me for being raped. ,"**EDIT2: Since most of you are still unclear what happened. At 4:00pm I made this post because I was really stressed out. I wasn't ever going to kill myself.**

**At 9:00pm I woke up to cops at my door because someone on Reddit submitted this post to hte police.**

**I have PTSD because I was sent to the psych ward hospital and abused, and almost raped by people in the hospital. I was sent to a group home where I was afraid of being raped, where I was abused emotionally by workers, and where was in physical danger due to the crazy people living there.**

**The cops wanted to send me to the hospital, but they understood my situation and even had experience at my group home, because believe me the cops were called a lot because the guy that lived there would try to kill people and do crazy shit a lot. That's what traumatized me.**

**My parents came and explained my situation. Cops left when they knew my parents were there.** 

I understand why you guys did what you did, or if was a mod or whatever. But jesus christ you should have messaged me first or something? I'm happy that cops like this stop people from killing themselves but it really backfired for me. Cops were super professional and shit. 

SO WHOEVER REPORTED THIS POST IT TOTALLY BACKFIRED BECAUSE I AM HAVING A MASSIVE FLASHBACK BECAUSE THEY ALMOST SENT ME BACK TO THE PLACE WHERE I WAS RAPED AND ASSAULTED.  I am y OK though because I have my parents on speed dail if things get messy. I was never going to kill myself. I am fine. Please don't call the cops anymore everything thing is under control. 
EDIT: EVERYONE

Cops showed up at my house at 9:00am

Because I am traumatized from being sent to the psych ward which caused the depression/anxiety problems so bad when I was 20  this caused a massive episode of Post Tramtic flashbacks 

My parents chilled with me and helped me through it and they agreed to not send me to the psych ward.


I was never going to actually kill myself, but I was really fucking depressed.

I had a Doctor Appointment next Thursday, where I was going to tell him about everything and get helo to see a new therapist, but I don't know the likelyhood of me going now that I am re-experiencing trauma. I have my parents on speeddial and they will help me through it.

Even though it caused such severe PTSD I never knew Reddit could do this, so I'm glad that you guys may be responsible for legitly stopping suicide. But really I did not need this to happen tonight. It was so counterproductive, but it's not like anyone on reddit would have known and you have to take procautions so I'm happy you probably stopped people.   

**tl;dr After this thread police showed up at my house and were going to take me to the place where I was traumatized in the first place. I understand why you did this but this was so unfortunate situation.**",70,2012-08-14 22:15:02 EDT-0400

1109,Good news! ,"I finally nutted up (and took a whole xanax so I wouldn't flake out *again*) and told my doctor that I was having a lot of problems with anxiety and depression and that I was having some pretty severe flashbacks since adopting my kids from foster care. He asked if I wanted someone to throw pills at me or a therapist. I've tried almost all the pills and while they help the depression somewhat, it doesn't get rid of the panic attacks. The one therapist I did see was great, but related to my adopted kids' therapy group, which made it hard to trust her. 

He said ""ok, do you want a male or female?""

""Male. I don't feel comfortable with female doctors."" (which is kinda weird because I'm a girl. I always feel judged with girl drs even though a couple are some of my favorite friends.)

So my Dr. says ""Well, my brother is a therapist who deals with adoption cases, foster children, and works with a lot of church groups. What do you think?""

OMG, that sounds perfect! This doctor is the only one I really feel comfortable with and there's another one of him that handles the issues I need as a special needs foster/adopt parent. 

Finally, I can get some treatment for me! Yay!",7,2012-08-11 07:51:51 EDT-0400

Usually talking to and cuddling with my husband helps but he is dead asleep right now. It's nice to know that there is a late night community that I can reach out to now.

I need to let go.

Still a great song, strangely enough it empowers me.

1117,"Oh God, the crowds.","I'll be going back to school soon, and while I enjoy learning and seeing people I know, I also know that this will mean football games and assemblies and crowded hallways and just a lot of people in general.

This terrifies me to no end.

I don't know why, but I've had this thing about being in a group of people, for a while. Even in class, I feel uncomfortable. I always feel as if I'm about to puke (one of my biggest fears, throwing up in public) and I always feel dizzy, and I psyche myself out even though physically there isn't anything wrong with me. 

However, I'd like a way for me to really be able to focus this year, because this year in school for me is very important. I'm sure others have experienced this, or just have general advice.

1120,Going places and people knocking on my door.,"Ok, so... when someone knocks at my door (I live alone) I usually freak-out, try to be as quite as possible, and hide on top of my washing machine. Sometimes I have nightmares where someone  I don't know is in my house. They never do anything, they just are there. One time my mother came to visit and slept in the next room. I ended up being so freaked out I yelled at her. I usually eat of a lot of antacid because of how stressed out I always am. 

I can only seem to go to the store and work. If I try to go somewhere else I usually get really nervous and turn around and go home. I get lonely sometimes, so I tried to go bars and places, but I always feel so terrible and I think, that it feels better just to stay home. I drink a lot at home, and that makes me feel better. Even when I go to the store, I have to walk around a while to calm down and look at a lot of stuff before I buy anything. I don't makes lists, because if I do i usually psych myself out and decide I don't need anything anyway.  

Work is alright. It is a desk job at office with thousands of other people and I work with a lot of different people, but it is usually ok. I am good at what I do, so maybe that is how I deal with it. Maybe its because things are rather formal. I am not sure why. If we have a large meeting and everyone is leaving at the same time, that is usually frightening. 

I have never actually told anyone any of this. I just wanted to get it out there. Thanks for reading.",3,2012-08-12 00:33:58 EDT-0400

1122,"DAE go into an ""emergency mode"" that shuts down your anxiety symptoms for a bit?","This has happened to me a few times, and it's always when the event or whatever is just SO big and SO hard to manage that I know I won't make it through unless I shut off my anxiety. 

For example, I studied abroad in Japan. I had a ridiculously long flight and a busy orientation and lots of phobias around food poisoning, lack of sleep, insomnia, and so on. But it was just so outside of my comfort zone that I was like, NOPE, I'm not going to be anxious. And it worked!

Of course, it never works in familiar or semi-comfortable situations, like when I can't sleep on a weeknight and have to go to work (or graduate from college!! :P) the next morning. It's only in serious ""emergencies"" like that, and it's all very subconscious. 

Anyone else have this? Did you find a way to tap into it in more familiar situations as well? Just curious :)",20,2012-08-12 19:24:08 EDT-0400
1123,Panic attack while leaving the therapists.,"I had my second session with my therapist today. The first one left me feeling really good and hopeful, but this one was a little bit harder. I'm trying to be as open as possible to everything she says. We were discussing how I need to learn to accept certain things. I agreed with her, but I kept explaining that even though I believe that that's true, I don't know how to actually do it. I can tell myself to accept things, but it seems to never actually happen. I still get really upset.

I guess I sort of felt like she was really frustrated at me at one point. She kept telling me the key was acceptance, and I would say, ""But how do I do that?"" and she'd say, ""I just told you! Acceptance!"" I stopped questioning it and just forced myself to consider that I could accept something, without automatically telling myself that I can't, even if I want to. I felt a little bit better then, and like I was understanding more of what she was saying. She never looked angry, or yelled, but it seemed like she irritated at me. Of course, I tend to take things personally, so I don't know that this was at all true, but it affected me a little bit.

When I left, I felt like crying, but I couldn't really explain why. As soon as I started crying, in the car, I thought to myself how stupid I was for *crying*, and then immediately decided that was *not* the right thing to do. I began repeating to myself that it was okay, that things will be okay, that things are getting better, only positive things. But then I started hyperventilating and it was a battle to get myself under control. As soon as I started hyperventilating, my hands and feet went numb, I got incredibly dizzy and my vision started to go. *I was driving*. I immediately started figuring out how to get off the road, while also trying to maintain my breathing. I was in the middle lane of three lanes and there were cars on either side of me. Plus, I was so dizzy, I could hardly see or concentrate, so I made the decision *not* to pull off the road and just slowed way down. I finally got my breathing under control and slowly became less dizzy as I drove with complete diligence. My limbs were still tingly minutes later.

What the hell? I've had panic attacks before, but usually after I've been emotionally crazy for a little white, and this is only the second one I've ever had that hit me and just seemed like it took over my entire body immediately. It was scary -- being behind the wheel meant my life, and other's lives, were in danger. How could a *therapy* session trigger the worst panic attack I've had since I was 17? Is this normal? Do I tell her about it? Is this is a really bad sign, or does it mean I'm just working through my problem? Any advice at all? I'm still shaken up.",12,2012-08-09 23:36:28 EDT-0400

1128,Drug Hysteria Garbage,"Mass antidepressant hysteria.  There's a lot of it here.  Why is that?  Let's take a look at the hysteria and what causes it and why I have such disdain for those who perpetuate it.

When I was young, I went to my dad and told him something int he house was broken, I don't remember what.  He responded by saying ""why doesn't anyone come tell me 'hey, the dishwasher is working great'?""  Obviously, if the dishwasher is working as expected there's no reason to report on it.  Just load it up and hit start.  Get on with your life.

The situation didn't do anything for me at the time but it stuck with me.  And I'm glad it did, because it comes up often in critical thinking.

If you Google your drugs, you'll notice a lot of people with problems taking the drug your doctor just prescribed you.  The people who post that stuff are generally the *people who have had problems*.  Count how many there are.  There seems to be a lot.  Now research how many people take the drugs.  Do some math.  Now count how many people report good things.  Do some more math.  Something doesn't seem right, does it?

Because those who have enjoyed the benefits of the drug they are taking, they are out enjoying the benefits of their medications, and living life possibly free of their symptoms.  They have better things to do than to go post on forums!  They represent what you might be trying to accomplish.  This is simple logic.

Yet people grab on to these bad posts and run with them, propagating the hysteria everywhere they see an opportunity.  And that's sad because these bad posts are causing a lot of fear of these drugs.  On nearly every post about Effexor, for instance, you'll find someone who is now afraid to take the med their doctor prescribed because of the hysterical posts by non-doctors.

Now, I'm all for being cautious.  But I have also seen meds save people's quality of life, their way of life, *their life*.  I've had it happen first hand, and I've seen it over and over again.  Data supports this relief people feel using SSRIs and SNRIs.  Do a little digging before giving up on what your doctor told you to do.  And if you still have concerns DON'T POST HERE, GET A SECOND OPINION FROM A PSYCH DOC!  There are only a few docs here, and if they are reputable, they will not diagnose you or advise you here and will recommend seeing a doctor.

One of the big hysterias that came up recently is that withdrawing from SSRIs and SNRIs quickly or cold turkey is monumentally a bad thing and VERY DANGEROUS!  I have a goal now to show that there are no absolutes.  If your doctor says it's ok, trust them.  If you don't trust them, get a second opinion.  If you're still not satisfied, look at peer-reviewed studies on the subject, and NOT anecdotal information (even mine) posts on forums (even mine) or sites that have a vendetta against big pharma (even mi...wait, I don't have one of those).

Just don't get afraid.  Especially by posts from non-doctors.  And if someone says they are a medical professional, always seek credentials.  Consider the source.  Find out who is saying what is being said.  Doubt, but ultimately decide based on solid information.  

The drug you wind up taking, even temporarily, may put you back in touch with what it feels like to have a life.  You may have to try a few different meds, but if meds are indicated, make informed decisions about what you are trying. Don't believe the hype.

If you decide to go the natural route first, good on you!  You might find that your anxiety is something completely manageable through good diet, exercise, meditation, yoga, or spirituality.  Or you might find non-drug approaches like CBT, ACT, or DBT work just fine for you without any drugs at al.  If that's the case, awesome!  I envy you.

But if all that fails, remember that *you* haven't failed, that there may be medical reasons for your anxiety and depression, and that it's not your fault.

More often than not, if you and your doctor have decided that meds are the way to go or at least try, you're going to need to try multiple different meds to see what helps with the fewest side effects.  For example, while most people can tolerate Zoloft, it gave me eye twitches that interfered with my ability to work.

I'll continue that example.  Because I need to work, it became necessary to stop Zoloft ASAP.  The eye twitching wasn't dangerous, but it indicated a quick withdrawal because a guy's gotta make a living.

Other times, the side effects of a drug may get into more serious territory.  For instance, I personally know people for whom Effexor worked just fine, but for me it caused side effects that were disturbing, but also indicated there may be medical reasons to get off of it quickly.  Nothing life-threatening, but some possible digestive and sexual dysfunction problems (and I don't mean not being able to get it up, check out ""retrograde ejaculation"").  Plus the med just wasn't doing what it needed to do for me.

Still other times, if your doc feels you can handle it, he may want you to move on to the next drug quickly, because why drag it out?  I work for myself and can take a few days off whenever I want, so this is no problem.  My doctor knows that.  And he knows I've been on the med-go-round for a while now and can handle the abrupt withdrawal.

Whatever the reason, if your doc says ""get off now, today"" or you just can't take the side effects of a particular drug anymore and your doc says it's ok, I want to give a first-hand account that with a doctor's ok and with monitoring, going cold turkey IS NOT MONUMENTALLY DANGEROUS.  It's ok in a lot of cases, and it's not in others.  That's why you check with doc first.  But don't believe this hype that getting off of SSRIs and SNRIs quickly or even cold turkey is going to kill you no matter what.  Again, consider the sources of this information.

The things I've talked about here, the bad posts, the alarmist attitudes towards things your doctor wants you to try, the absolutist beliefs that it's ALWAYS dangerous to get off SSRIs and SNRis cold turkey only add to the hysteria that these are horrible drugs and have no value or benefit whatsoever.  These drugs have their place.  I've seen them work to great success in my own family and friends.  And I've seen people continue to suffer because they believed the stuff they read on the Internet that said their drug was horrible.  Which road you choose, which information you choose to believe is between you and your doctors.  Trust them, get second opinions if you don't trust yours, read peer-reviewed articles, do whatever it takes to make an informed decision.  Don't go by my anecdotal information, find out for yourself.  And certainly don't believe the drug-bashing hype.  You may be cheating yourself out of a better life.

In one class, we were put into groups for a project and had to do a presentation.  Weeks before the presentation I started feeling uneasy.  I couldn't eat or sleep and couldn't stop thinking about the presentation.  Presentation day finally came, and it was my turn to speak.  My mouth was so dry and my voice was so small that the professor told me to speak up.  I stopped and began again but I jumbled my words up.  I froze there, standing in front of the entire classroom and I couldn't move.  I couldn't move or speak.  It was the scariest moment of my life.  I felt like I was standing there forever, and it wasn't until people from my group helped me back to my seat and they finished my part of the presentation.  I sat at my table and cried.  I couldn't stop shaking.  Every day after that presentation, I thought about how much I hated myself.  Whenever I took a shower, I just stood there thinking about how great it would be to just get hit by a bus.  I was incredibly depressed.  I stopped showing up to class and dropped out of that university.

Since that presentation, I've avoided many situations that would make me feel uncomfortable.  Since starting university, my high school friends made new friends.  I've stopped seeing them because I felt too uncomfortable around them.  I work part time in an office and I'll call in sick to work every time we had a scheduled meeting, or if we had some office lunch party.  I'd do anything it took to avoid being in uncomfortable situations.

I switched schools and attended a new university with a different career path.  I researched different jobs on google, trying to find one with the least amount of interaction with people.  During the first day of any class, I'd look through the syllabus to see if there were any presentations or group work.  If there was, then I'd drop out of that class and find something else.  If I was forced to take the class, then I'd skip out on the presentation and lose 10% of my final grade.  I've been avoiding presentations since that first terrible presentation.

I'm in a critical thinking class, where we do group discussions every day.  Sometimes the professor picks us out and asks us questions on what we think about articles we're assigned to read.  This class is killing me and every time she picks out random people to speak, I die in my seat.  She's picked me once, and I really thought I was going to die.  I sit in the corner at the back and when she asked me, I answered quickly and quietly and then sat there tearing up and shaking.  I really hope nobody saw me.

In this critical thinking class, we're assigned to do a presentation.  I e-mailed the professor to tell her in advanced that I would not be doing the final presentation.  She e-mailed back and told me it was required.  I need to take this class in order to graduate.  The upcoming presentation is not for another 3 months and I've been stressing out about it for the last 2 weeks.  I can't eat properly and can't sleep.  I have a terrible, terrible, dreadful feeling in my chest.  I was so close to finishing university without having to do a presentation.  I can't quit and start over again.  I can't stop thinking about it.  

I don't know where I""m going with any of this.  It took me almost 2 hours typing all this out.  I'm sorry it's so long.  I don't know what I want from this.  Thanks for reading and listening.",7,2012-01-22 11:10:49 EST-0500

1132,Overcoming Anxiety: The RPG,"I was reading an article in Popular Science about ""gamifying"" your life and realized I could use that concept to help me overcome debilitating panic attacks that have been crippling my life for a while.  Cognitive Therapy hasn't made a dent in it, and Behavioral Therapy helped but I couldn't keep the motivation up.  Logging my behavior and creating a reward system seems halfway to a game anyways, so this has a good chance of working.  
  
Steps:  
  
Identify goal  
  
Split goal into sub-goals.  
  
Identify smallest possible action that you can do to accomplish the first sub-goal.  
  
Accomplish the small action, roll 1d6 for karma gained.  
  
If doing the action accomplished the sub-goal, add a bonus to your karma (2d6 times 2).  If you completed the goal, add a large bonus (3d6 times 5).  

Note that if you did a larger amount than you expected, you can always reward yourself with more karma (roll an extra die and/or multiply the result by a number).  
  
Example Goal:  
Getting a job  
  
Sub-goals:  
Create resume  
Fill out application  
Turn in application  
Go to interview  
  
Remember: actions must at all times be doable.  Even if it seems ridiculously small, it's better to get a tiny amount done than nothing at all, and it's almost as easy.  
  
You need to have a 6-sided die so you can roll for karma, as well as something to keep track of your current karma.  I'm going to use my cell phone for this: it has a Drafts folder, so I'll just save the current value as an un-sent text message.  You don't have to use a cell phone, so long as you keep the record on or near you as often as possible and can easily update it.  A notebook or scrap of paper with a pen or pencil would also work fine for this.  
  
If there's enough interest I'll let you guys know how well it works.  
  
EDIT: You don't have to use the ""roll for karma"" system here.  An alternative is to create a list of rewards for yourself that are small and easy to get, make a point list, and buy the rewards when you get enough points.  
  
Alternately, you could just reward yourself whenever you achieve a small action.  
  
In these versions no rolling is needed, just a flat reward for achieving the small actions.  Of course, if you prefer to roll you can still do that in addition to the point-buy list.  
  
I created the rolling system because the rewards I came up with weren't motivating me, and I noticed that reddit karma is an effective motivator.  It seemed like a natural combination, though I understand that some people do better with more concrete rewards.",10,2012-01-24 05:33:00 EST-0500

1137,Anxiety is affecting my work - I'm at the last straw or else I will be fired. Need help! ,"Even though I don't like my job, and have been looking for new work, I've been trying not to seem checked out, looking for new ways to keep my interest (being more proactive about certain aspects that I do like). 

I've been dealing with a trauma that happened over a year ago. In the past 6 months, I've been exhibiting extreme anxiety and it's affecting my work. I have a counselor, but the PTSD is getting worse because my work performance has been getting worse. It's been affecting my non-work life, but I thought that work wasn't affected. In the past two weeks, I've caught myself noticing that is definitely affecting my work.

I've been written up twice and if I get written up again I'll be 'considered for termination'. On the paper work it says that I don't pay attention to detail and lack communication. I do pay attention, but as my anxiety gets worse, particularly around people, I find it harder to handle the situation (my hands shake, I can't look people in the eye, I'm forgetting information). There are triggers everywhere.

Stupidly, it has just now occurred to me it is my anxiety that's interfering and not my disinterest for my job. I'm reaching that point where I'm a bit scared to go to work. Not the people I work with, but the clients who come in and what I will mess up on this time. It's a grab bag, and the last time I had a client who really triggered me, I miscounted some money and was *considerably* off the total (in the hundreds). I got written up for that, obviously. It is also possible he could have taken some of it back when I wasn't looking, but I was in a haze of anxiety, I can't remember. 

I guess my question is....would it be too late for me to get a doctor's note or something explaining that I have PTSD and it's affecting my work performance? If I sat down with my boss and explained it, will it seem like I'm making up excuses? The trauma itself is extremely personal, I don't know how well it'd go over to tell her. She seems kind of done with me, I don't know how much longer I have left there. Jobs are currently hard to come by as well, so I'm not having much luck when it comes to submitting resumes.

I had a few bumps in the road with anxiety but last semester turned out to be very rewarding. Now that I'm back for the spring semester I feel like my anxiety is coming back. It feels more like a wave of anxiety and sadness rather than a constant thing. It happens once or twice a day along with stomach issues. I can eat fine but I feel like my stomach is always acting up. I've been reaching out to friends and trying to stay busy so I stop dwelling on it and I'm meeting with a counselor in a few days. I also go home on the weekends, which I did last semester and it helps a lot and I'm comfortable doing it. When this wave comes over me I just feel upset and want to cry and it feels like the rest of the week will last forever and I'll keep feeling like this. Basically I keep focusing on the long term rather than today when I'm anxious. I slowly but surely have been felling better but was wondering if anyone had tips to calm down or to relax a bit.

1155,[Rant]I've ruined any chance at an education or career because of this problem...,"Some background, I'm 24. I've been wanting to kill myself since I was 13 or so. I watched my mother die when I was 12. I type this out a lot in various places, but it helps. She died when I was 12, and my dad died when I was 20. Problems on top of problems.

Since my dad died, money has been a constant struggle. I'm basically leaching off of family and relying on food stamps.

I've had chances to go to college, and I've fucked up everyone my non attendance. I wrote letters to get financial aid back, but this time I think it's over. I think I'm suspended indefinitely. Without financial aid, there will be no college or career.

I had a 3.5 in high school and did well enough to get a scholarship to college. The June before my freshmen year, my dad found out he had lung cancer. He started an aggressive chemotherapy routine that destroyed his body. I lived alone with him. I never gave a fuck about college from the minute I started. I was too far down the rabbit hole of depression about losing my one last parent.

Since then, I've tried going. I'll go a couple weeks. Then one day I'll just wake up scared to go. I feel paralyzed. I feel like killing myself would be better than having to go in among people. Eventually I decided to stop putting myself through this torture and not go. Then the guilt sets in.

It's not just my education. I have horrible job experience dominated by ""no shows"" so I basically have no job experience or references at 24. The last job I had was at retail. I cried before work every morning because I hated it. I would cut myself and drink Jack Daniels before I went in. I'd park the car and open the bottle. 

Of course, suicidal feelings were rampant at this time. Also, homicidal feelings for the first time. I hated people, and I never had before.

While all this is happening, I started having serious health issues. My doctor believes it's MS. I can't find out because I don't have insurance or money. In my head, I've convinced myself it's worse than MS and probably an inoperable tumor. 

At this point, I can't do anything. I can't find a job that's not retail, and I can't do that. I applied for disability and was denied twice. I'm losing financial aid so no chance of helping myself. I don't know how to get help for my health.

What's worse? I'm frozen. People tell me things to do, you know. Contact these people, see about this. I'm at the point where I'm scared to call or email people. I get panicked at the thought of it and begin hurting myself.

So I'm helpless. There's literally not a god damn fucking thing I can do at this point. I have a doctor who gives me Klonopin, but I can't even leave the house to go get it. I'm too scared.

I'm pathetic and my life is meaningless.

Thanks for reading.

I have a great amount of respect for him for being open and honest about his problem. I have gone through a similar situation (although clearly not on this scale) where I was honest with an employer about my panic attacks in certain situations. They still tried to force me to work in those situations even though it was irrelevant to my main job. I ended up losing my job over it, and I'm still unemployed.

[Here is a great 8 minute documentary about Royce on draft day.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BRUS6QBiViQ&feature=colike) I appreciate that he is vocal about how much he is panicking, and he is not shy about letting the people around him know that he is in distress. I thought it was interesting that he has probably played college basketball in front of thousands of people, but he couldn't be in a room with about 30 supporters because it felt like ""a pack of wolves.""

I tried to explain to my employer about my panic attacks dealing with crowds of people, and they wanted me to give them an exact number of how many people there needed to be in order for me to feel an attack coming on. They could not appreciate that it was more complex than that, and I couldn't give them an exact number because of all the social factors involved.

I hope that the publicity from this case will help people understand that severe anxiety is not a choice or a quirk, but a mental illness that needs to be dealt with properly in order for a person to function and concentrate on the things that they do well.",9,2012-11-18 21:07:17 EST-0500

I work in a popular coffee shop and I have to talk to strangers pretty much all day every day. I find that over the years of working there I've become decent at small talk with random customers, ""hi how are you, hows your day"" etc, and this causes me very little anxiety. The problem I have is with regular customers. When someone becomes a regular at my store, when I see them over and over again, the more anxious I become. Dealing with these people who I see relatively often makes my heart race and causes me to become lightheaded and shaky. 

It is the same with friends, unless they are someone I see all the time, then I get really anxious even seeing them, and that makes it hard for me to talk to them.

1161,"Is it anxiety, or what?","It all started around May, 2011.

I was working at a movie theater, and I was standing there as a movie was letting out, standing in the hallway waiting for everyone to get out so our crew could go in and clean it. 

I was just standing there, and thinking to myself, nothing out the norm. But all of the sudden I just think this stupid random thought of, ""What if everything isn't real?"" 

Then boom. It hits me. Everything around me seemed foreign, and scary. My heart was racing, my mouth tasted metallic from the adrenaline that was pumping through me. It was really really scary. I went straight for the restroom to rinse my face, hoping that would help. After I walked out, I just felt like a ghost, and I was just going through the motions of just walking around a crowd of people. I don't know, it's really hard to explain. It just felt like I was living in a dream or something, if that makes sense?

That messed me up for awhile, I didn't want to do anything, because I'd have ""flashbacks' so to speak of that moment, where little spurts of ""nothing seems real"" happened hourly for about 6 months. 

Part of me knew that it was just chemicals in my head acting funny, or something. Or that maybe it was just all in my head. So I didn't really talk to anybody about it, cause I didn't want to seem crazy. 

Anyways, fastforward to now, and I still feel like those experiences stick with me. The only thing I can really point my finger to is anxiety. Because I have similar feelings of those experiences while I'm with new people, or in big crowds of people.

Anyway I was stressing on that when I found a lump and I started to think I had cancer. 
So thinking I had cancer AND a heart problem I was super stressed. The lump was just a big pimple thing. It went away. 
Then I got this weird heat burning in the center of my chest. I was convinced it was the onset of a heart attack! Turns out it was just heartburn from all the stress I was under. I even went to the emergency room. They said it was nothing. 
Now months later I am having trouble breathing but I think it's because of all the acid in my stomach from stress.  I am on medication  for it but it takes a while to kick in. 

How the hell to I break this cycle? 
I seem to go from on worry to the next!  Even when the doctor told me not to worry, stay off google and eat better. 

Does anyone have any advice on how to stop making myself sick? I just can not seem to let go of me being sick in some way and constant worry about it.

1164,"Some thoughts I'm having about treating anxiety and depression, in relation to other diseases...","I think that people should treat mental illness like they treat other illnesses. If you started coughing up blood you would go to a doctor. If you had a brain tumor you would go to a doctor. If you have a condition that causes you to be unable to work normally, alters your heart rate, changes your eating habits, and makes you tired or insomniac then you should go to a doctor.

For a lot of people without anxiety or depression they think we can just ""snap out of it"". Do they also think that cancer patients should go into remission after 1 round of chemo? Do they think it's ok to stop taking your antibiotics as soon as the symptoms start going away, even though the box says to take all of them? (don't answer that...)

1170,"Got what I wanted, now I feel like I shouldn't have tried... ","I can't stop thinking about a minor incident at work with my supervisor.  Basically she is violating the manager's policy on splitting tips evenly- I haven't said anything before but the other night I tried to claim a share.  She stopped me, but then backtracked and said I could have a share ""if you want.""  It wasn't much, so I threw the money back down and said, ""Whatever,"" in my ""dangerous"" voice.  As I was leaving, another co-worker ran out and handed me some money.  I feel like I was taking advantage of the situation- I'm older than the supervisor, male, much bigger, etc. I've been told that I'm extremely intimidating (and my hobbies and work in the past only add to this- I'm a military veteran and have studied martial arts).  I know that I was entitled to a fair share but I feel like I failed by intimidating my way into what I wanted, and now I can't stop thinking about it.",4,2012-11-20 17:23:07 EST-0500

1173,Feeling numb. Got into huge fight with boyfriend on our anniversary. Don't know what to do. ,"This whole thing started because I told him I was upset that he didn't even acknowledge the day, I didn't expect any gifts because we're tight on money right now, but he didn't kiss me good morning, or tell me he loved me, nothing. He said he did acknowledge it when I asked if he was making dinner and he asked what I wanted, which in my mind isn't really acknowledging it at all. Yadda yadda we start to argue about theh same thing we are always arguing about, him not showing appreciation, acting like he cares about me, I take everything he says too seriously, I have asked him many, many, many times to even just take one minute out of his day to text me telling me he loves me, or to ask me how my day is going and I think he's done it twice in the last month. I asked him what was going on with him and why he doesn't do it. I asked him if it was because he really didn't care at all. I asked him outright if he loved me and he said he did and I asked him if he was still attracted to me and he paused and just looked at me and said ""Not really"". It's been almost two years since I had our child and I have lost a good chunk of the baby weight but my form isn't where it used to be. I understand I should be working out for my own benefit but like I told him, ""I lam attracted to you no matter what you look like."" I don't care that he's going bald, I don't care that he's not as in shape as when we first started dating, I always find him sexy, and I always want to have sex, which he doesn't. Now before yesterday I was feeling pretty good about my body having just lost 15 lbs, but now I just feel embarrassed, and fat, and disgusting. I want to work out, I want to be in shape like I used to be, but the thought of working out is embarrassing. I don't want him to see me doing it, I don't want him to see me naked. I just feel so hurt. I feel numb, I don't want to do anything. The thought of him leaving because I'm not good enough makes me sick. The thought of him actually being that shallow makes me sick. The thought of him cheating on me makes me sick. So now I'm sitting here at work thinking of all of this over, and over, and over, and trying not to cry, trying to just push it all down somewhere where I can't feel it where I can just be numb and not have to worry anymore. I apologize for the wall of text. 

TL;DR Boyfriend doesn't find me as attractive as he used to; making me feel sick and crying a lot. ",8,2012-11-19 19:23:49 EST-0500

I'm really freaking out over here. I'm in MI and I'm suffering from Social Anxiety Disorder, Generalized Anxiety Disorder and Panic Disorder. 

Lately, my roommate has been really distant and I kinda freaked out on her last night about how I'm scared that she hates me now. She told me to 'chill the fuck out' and I'm also scared that I made her really mad. I don't know what to do anymore. I'm really scared.

Because I've been thinking about .... suicide lately. I feel like I can't handle it anymore. I feel like if I lose her as a friend, then I have no reason to keep going. She's my best friend and I feel like she wants nothing to do with me anymore and that I'm a burden. 
I've started going to therapy again, but it's taking so long week to week. What if she bails on me because of my anxiety coming back so strongly?

1185,This is how we go on.,"This is how we go on: one day a time, one meal at a time, one pain at a time, one breath at a time. Dentists go on one root canal at a time; boat builders go on one hull at a time. If you write books, you go on one page at a time. We turn from all we know and all we fear. We study catalogues, watch football games, choose Sprint over AT&T. We count the birds in the sky and will not turn from the window when we hear the footsteps behind as something comes up the hall; we say yes, I agree that clouds often look like other things - fish and unicorns and men on horseback - but they are really only clouds. Even when the lightning flashes inside them we say they are only clouds and turn our attention to the next meal, the next pain, the next breath, the next page. This is how we go on.

This is a quote from a Stephen King's book. Of course, I don't believe SK had anxiety in mind when he was writing this, but he is a horror writer, and IMO knows oh so well how to put fear in words.

Personally, I find it really helpful and comforting. Because, as I am beginning to realize, this is how you fight anxiety/depression. This is how you go on.

1187,My imagination can do wonders...,"I'm 35 and have had anxiety and depression since I was 13.  I have a garden in the back of my apartment and in the front.  I have never done anything in the front garden over the past 3 or so years I've lived here except trim two trees because I am too nervous to work out there.  It is only a sidewalk away from the road and there is a medical building across the street that always has people coming and going during the day.  I always feel like people are watching me and analyzing me.  But today was so beautiful out and the flowers are coming up and I haven't seen much sun or been outside much since November.  So I decided I was going to try something.  Before I went out I set up a story for myself....that it was after the end of the world, and that I was the only one left.  That everyone I would see and hear were just in my mind, that they weren't real.  And for survival I had to tend to gardens to make sure plants were kept alive.  And it worked pretty well!!  Every time I started to feel nervous and self-conscious when someone drove by or pulled into the parking lot I told myself they weren't real and I am all that is and all that matters.  Maybe there is something to this....I may have to turn my mind into a video game when I'm out in public.  It probably won't work in all situations, but I'm getting older and I don't want this anxiety to keep making me unable to do fun things.  I don't want to become 80 and say...""wow, I wish I had done simple things like played in the sunshine more.""  I haven't even gone swimming in about 10 years because of my fear of judgment and being watched.  Something has to budge.

1188,Panic attacks...,"Hey guys, im reaching out because ive been having panic attacks fro about 2 months now. My dad was diagnosed with cancer in september of last year and passed away february of this year. Thats pretty much what everyone thinks is causing them. My first one happened in january, and they have been happening a different intervals at different intensities since then. Ive had ones so bad enough where i checked myself into a hospital, twice. They did several heart and chest scans, as well as blood labs and they all came back ok. 

Im not really sure what to do. Its starting to cause insomnia. I have trouble falling asleep and then staying asleep. this started to happen about a week ago. They perscribed me ativan for anxiety but i dont take it at the right times or at all even so i feel like its not helping, even with sleep. 

I am also seeing a counselor through my university, but i dont think i see him often enough for it to help so far.

1190,Ridicilousness of being afraid of fear.. ,"So I was walking around yesterday.. Feeling connected to my inner fear.. This primal fear that people usually feel in their nightmares.. Something that I used to wake up to as a child. Screaming my head off.. And I was afraid of this primal inner fear..

Until I realized. That this inner fear.. It is not there to freak me out. It is there to protect me, the fear has a purpose and its purpose definetly is not to give me another anxiety attack or
for me to feel it constantly for no purpose.

It is one of the last things I struggle with when it comes to anxiety. I have been rejecting this feeling, thus giving a rise to it.

Basically I know I have this emotion inside of me and I know that this feeling makes me anxious. And I do not want to feel anxious. But it is like this glowing radioactive core inside of me that is pretty hard to ignore. All I have to do is ""look inside of me"" and there it is. Ready to make me feel deep fear.

I guess I should not reject it.

Neither should I check in on it every few seconds.. 

But hopefully make it work right again. Ie. I should not feel it walking around.. I should acknowledge that it is there. It is not mysterious, it is not there to freak me out. I am not going crazy because of it. It has its purpose, there are times when we are supposed to feel feelings like that.. But not for a whole day. For no purpose..

Scientifically.. I think it is almost like being directly connected to the amygdala.. The neurons that are able to 
trigger the flight or fight response.. After long period with anxiety.. I have become conscious of what is supposed to be hidden inside of me..

And instead of ackowledging as part of me.. As part of me there to protect me.. I have been afraid of it.. Almost like it was this alien invader in my thoughts. Which it is not.. 

I hope my subconscious mind gets this message.

Anyone else with similar experiences?",1,2012-03-17 17:24:00 EDT-0400
1191,"In a hole of anxiety and depression, ""The Downward Spiral.""","Let's start with a mini-bio.

I've basically spent my entire life (I'm 19) trying to improve myself. In elementary school, I dealt with severe depression and anxiety, though the symptoms were quite twisted at that age. In middle school, I was bullied because I was socially awkward and didn't know how to properly react to situations. In high school, I began to realize just how fucked up I really am, and began my mission to improve myself.

The only thing I fixed was social phobia. I gained the ability to talk to people. But not comfortably.

I had fairly severe panic attacks every day during the last year of high school. I could barely function, and it was a huge challenge to graduate that year.

Now, about a year after graduation, I haven't improved at all.

I'm *obsessed* with trying to improve myself, make myself better, learn skills, etc. But I fail at these attempts, every time. I've tried *everything* (seriously), and I don't know what to do now.

My problem is that I have spent my entire life trying to get better, and have gotten *nowhere*. I've began to slowly self-destruct (abusing my prescriptions, destroying friendships, self-harm, etc), because I've completely stopped caring about the consequence of my actions -- it's like I've been trained that *no matter what I do, there isn't a positive result.*

Every day, I spend the entire day thinking of what I can do to be productive, but I lack the motivation because I feel like shit due to the anxiety and partly depression. When I *am* on my benzos, I'm actually productive and happy because I can think straight and fearlessly socialize and do whatever I want... until I say ""fuck it,"" and take huge doses of the benzos because I figure I'm going to suffer sooner or later. This process has repeated for months.

I'd kill myself if I had the balls to, but I don't have the balls to do it. I figure that eventually, I *will* overdose on something like benzos within ten years, but until (if) then, I don't know what to do. I want to self-destruct as hard as I can; smash myself into pieces. Ruin everything. Destroy everything I have. Because regardless of the state of my life, I'm not going to be happy.

I'm posting this here because I'm wondering if anybody else has experienced a similar situation and perhaps was lucky enough to find a way out of it. I'm currently looking to experience something ""new"", like a psychedelic drug experience, since I'm too afraid to get a job at the moment and perhaps move out along with that.

I don't think I've ever been more infuriated, pissed off, frustrated, and upset at my life before, ignoring the fact that I don't feel emotion at all.

The biggest trigger of my anxiety and suffering: *Not knowing*.",11,2012-03-19 15:10:42 EDT-0400
