A randomized controlled trial examining CBT for college students with ADHD,"Objective: College students with attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) are at increased risk for numerous educational and psychosocial difficulties. This study reports findings from a large, multisite randomized controlled trial examining the efficacy of a treatment for this population, known as ACCESS-Accessing Campus Connections and Empowering Student Success. Method: ACCESS is a cognitive–behavioral therapy program delivered via group treatment and individual mentoring across two semesters. A total of 250 students (18–30 years of age, 66% female, 6.8% Latino, 66.3% Caucasian) with rigorously defined ADHD and comorbidity status were recruited from two public universities and randomly assigned to receive ACCESS immediately or on a 1-year delayed basis. Treatment response was assessed on three occasions, addressing primary (i.e., ADHD, executive functioning, depression, anxiety) and secondary (i.e., clinical change mechanisms, service utilization) outcomes. Results: Latent growth curve modeling (LGCM) revealed significantly greater improvements among immediate ACCESS participants in terms of ADHD symptoms, executive functioning, clinical change mechanisms, and use of disability accommodations, representing medium to large effects (Cohen's d, .39–1.21). Across these same outcomes, clinical significance analyses using reliable change indices (RCI; Jacobson &amp; Truax, 1992) revealed significantly higher percentages of ACCESS participants showing improvement. Although treatment-induced improvements in depression and anxiety were not evident from LGCM, RCI analyses indicated that immediate ACCESS participants were less likely to report a worsening in depression/anxiety symptoms. Conclusions: Findings from this RCT provide strong evidence in support of the efficacy and feasibility of ACCESS as a treatment for young adults with ADHD attending college.",2485545082, Journal Article,2021
Moderators of treatment response to an intervention for nonsuicidal self-injury in young adults,"Objective: Despite the prevalence and impact of nonsuicidal self-injury (NSSI), there are few treatments developed to treat the behavior specifically, and little is known about moderators of treatment response. The Treatment for Self-Injurious Behaviors (T-SIB), a brief, behavioral intervention, was developed to treat NSSI in young adults; a previous pilot randomized controlled trial (RCT) comparing T-SIB with treatment as usual (TAU) provided support for the intervention. This study examined demographic, clinical, and NSSI-related predictors of treatment outcome in the pilot RCT for T-SIB. Method: Young adults (N = 33) were randomized to receive T-SIB or treatment as usual; all participants were included in intent-to-treat analyses. The primary outcome of NSSI behaviors was assessed at baseline, posttreatment (9 weeks), and 3-month follow up, and potential moderators were assessed at baseline. Results: Greater lifetime and last year NSSI frequency was associated with fewer NSSI behaviors at posttreatment and follow up among participants in T-SIB. Anxious symptoms also moderated treatment outcomes, but other demographic and clinical variables did not. Conclusion: Previous research has shown that T-SIB is more effective than TAU overall; the current study suggests that T-SIB may be effective for individuals with more frequent NSSI and those with elevated anxiety. A larger evaluation of T-SIB is supported. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved)",2459435074, Journal Article,2020
Reassessing evidence-based content in popular smartphone apps for depression and anxiety: Developing and applying user-adjusted analyses,"Objective: To assess the dissemination of evidence-based content within smartphone apps for depression and anxiety by developing and applying user-adjusted analysis-a method for weighting app content based on each app's number of active users. Method: We searched the Apple App Store and Google Play Store and identified 27 apps within the top search hits, which real-world users are most likely to encounter. We developed a codebook of evidence-based treatment elements by reviewing past research on empirically supported treatments. We coded the apps to develop an initial tally of the frequency of treatment elements within the mental health (MH) apps. We then developed and applied user-adjusted analysis to refine the tallies based on each app's number of monthly active users. Results: The 2 most popular apps were responsible for 90% of monthly active users, and user-adjusted analysis markedly altered conclusions of prior reports based on tallies alone. For example, mindfulness was present in 37% of apps but reached 96% of monthly active users, cognitive restructuring was present in 22% but reached only 2%, and exposure was present in 7% but reached only 0.0004%. Conclusions: The potential impact of MH apps on mental health may be best evaluated via assessment that combines tallies of evidence-based content with data on the content users are actually accessing. Given wide variation in the popularity of MH apps, findings weighted by usage data may differ markedly from findings based on raw tallies alone.

"Temporal relations among sleep, depression symptoms, and anxiety symptoms during intensive cognitive–behavioral treatment","Objective: Bidirectional relations between sleep disturbances, depression symptoms, and anxiety symptoms have been frequently observed in empirical studies; however, little is known about the temporal relations between these variables in the context of treatment. Method: The current study examines the temporal relations between sleep parameters, depression symptoms, and anxiety symptoms in a large sample of individuals undergoing intensive cognitive–behavioral partial hospital treatment (N = 1,184). Random-intercept cross-lagged panel models were fit to these data to determine whether (1) sleep parameters uniquely predicted subsequent depression and anxiety symptoms and (2) depression and anxiety symptoms uniquely predicted subsequent sleep parameters. Results: Results revealed relations in both directions: later than usual bedtimes predicted higher than usual anxiety and depression the next day, shorter than usual sleep duration predicted higher than usual depression the next day, shorter than usual nighttime sleep onset latency predicted higher than usual anxiety the next day, and higher than usual anxiety predicted shorter than usual sleep duration on the next night. Conclusions: These finding suggest the potential value of examining sleep behaviors associated with sleep timing and circadian rhythms as important transdiagnostic factors during treatment for anxiety and depression. We discuss the implications for future studies of the relations between sleep and psychopathology symptoms and understanding individuals' experiences in the context of cognitive–behavioral treatment.

Predicting sudden gains before treatment begins: An examination of pretreatment intraindividual variability in symptoms,"Objective: Sudden gains during psychotherapy have been found to be predictive of positive treatment outcomes. Previous attempts at predicting occurrence of sudden gains have yielded equivocal findings. Recently, intraindividual variability in symptoms during treatment was suggested as a trans-therapeutic and trans-diagnostic predictor of sudden gains. The goal of the present study was to examine this predictor in Internet-delivered treatment for social anxiety disorder (SAD) and to examine whether this predictor predicts sudden gains when measured before treatment begins. Method: We examined data from a preregistered randomized controlled trial (RCT) of Internet-delivered cognitive–behavioral therapy (CBT) for SAD (n = 101). We measured variability in symptoms both within-treatment and before treatment (i.e. during waitlist). Results: Intraindividual variability in symptoms significantly predicted sudden gains both when measured before treatment or within-treatment and correctly classified 84% and 83% of individuals to sudden gains versus non-sudden gains status, respectively. Conclusions: Intraindividual variability in symptoms can predict sudden gains in Internet-delivered treatment for SAD, thus supporting its trans-diagnostic and trans-therapeutic nature. Predicting sudden gains before treatment begins has implications for treatment planning and clinical decision making as well as for personalized tailoring of interventions.",2435542561, Journal Article,2020
Reevaluating ruptures and repairs in alliance: Between- and within-session processes in cognitive–behavioral therapy and short-term psychodynamic psychotherapy,"Objective: Ruptures and repairs in alliance and their association with treatment outcome have been studied widely. Many of these studies have used indirect methods, focused on decreases in alliance across sessions while measuring alliance at postsession. However, this approach does not establish whether observed decreases occur within (as insinuated by most theories) or between sessions. In the current study, we examined decreases of alliance measured both pre- and postsession in 3 clinical trials and explored the phenomenology and interpretation of these decreases. Additionally, we investigated the effects of rupture magnitude and the interpretation of repairs on treatment outcome, examining whether the ""repairs benefit"" or the ""unrepaired ruptures damage"" theories were supported by the data. Method: Presession and postsession therapeutic alliance and outcome measures were examined from patients who participated in 1 of 3 studies: cognitive–behavioral therapy (CBT) for social anxiety disorder (N = 29), CBT for panic disorder (N = 31), or short-term psychodynamic psychotherapy for depression (N = 44). Patterns of change in alliance are described. Ruptures and repairs are examined according to several criteria and are used to predict outcome using longitudinal multilevel modeling. Results: In all samples, alliance systematically decreased between sessions and increased within them. Decreases in alliance as measured by traditional postsession to postsession were unreliable predictors of within-session decreases in alliance and of outcomes. Conclusions: Decreases in alliance across sessions are not valid measures of ruptures as defined by most theories. Instead, we suggest that they are indicative of an ebb-and-flow model for the development of alliance.",2435541033, Journal Article,2020
Community-based randomized controlled trial of psychological first aid with crime victims,"Objective: The first randomized controlled trial of psychological first aid (PFA) was conducted, using crime victims as participants. For study Aim 1, investigators tested whether paraprofessional victim advocates could be trained to deliver PFA to crime victims. For study Aim 2, investigators tested the effect of PFA delivery on victims' psychiatric (i.e., symptoms of PTSD, somatization, depression, anxiety, and substance use) and adaptive functioning outcomes. Method: Two law enforcement agencies served as study sites. A dynamic wait-listed design included a phase when advocates at both sites delivered usual services (US) to victims, a phase when one site was randomly selected to deliver PFA while the other delivered US, and a phase when both sites delivered PFA. Across all phases, 172 crime victims (mean age = 36.4 years; 81% female) were recruited, and a battery assessed their psychiatric symptoms and adaptive functioning at baseline and 1, 2, and 4 months postbaseline. Results: From the US to PFA phases, advocates' PFA adherence (i.e., their delivery of PFA components) increased significantly. PFA did not outperform US with regard to improvement on victims' individual psychiatric and adaptive functioning outcomes. However, on a composite global functioning outcome created for this trial, PFA yielded significantly greater improvement relative to US. Conclusion: Paraprofessional victim advocates have the capacity to deliver PFA. Conclusions regarding the effectiveness of PFA for crime victims vary depending on the nature of the scored outcome variable (individual vs. global), highlighting the importance of careful outcome measurement considerations in future research on PFA.",2435541516," Evidence Based Healthcare , Journal Article",2020
"Single-session digital intervention for adolescent depression, anxiety, and well-being: Outcomes of a randomized controlled trial with Kenyan adolescents","Background: Adolescent depression and anxiety symptoms are prevalent in sub-Saharan African countries, yet treatment options are scarce, and stigma limits help-seeking. Brief, computerized single-session interventions (SSIs) that contain empirically supported stigma-reducing elements may help expand access to treatment. We developed and evaluated such an intervention for Kenyan adolescents. Method: High school students (N = 103, age 13–18) were randomized to a digital SSI Shamiri-Digital (Shamiri means ""thrive"" in Kiswahili) or a study-skills control intervention. Shamiri-Digital consisted of reading and writing activities about 3 concepts: growth mindset, gratitude, and value affirmation. Both Shamiri-Digital and the study-skills control condition were delivered electronically in schools. Results: Compared to the control, Shamiri-Digital produced a greater reduction in adolescent depressive symptoms in both the full sample (p = .028, d = 0.50) and a subsample of youths with moderate to severe depression symptoms (p = .010, d = 0.83) from baseline to 2-week follow-up. The effects exceed the mean effects reported in meta-analyses of full-length, face-to-face psychotherapy for youth depression. There were no significant effects on anxiety symptoms, well-being, or happiness. Conclusion: This is the first report that a brief, computerized SSI may reduce depressive symptoms in adolescents in sub-Saharan Africa. Replication trials with extended follow-ups will help gauge the strength and durability of these effects.",2415495579," Evidence Based Healthcare , Journal Article",2020
"A transdiagnostic minority stress intervention for gender diverse sexual minority women's depression, anxiety, and unhealthy alcohol use: A randomized controlled trial","Objective: To remedy the notable gap in evidence-based treatments for sexual minority women, this study tested the efficacy of a minority-stress-focused cognitive–behavioral treatment intended to improve this population's mental and behavioral health. Method: The intervention, EQuIP (Empowering Queer Identities in Psychotherapy), was adapted from a transdiagnostic cognitive–behavioral treatment as also recently adapted for sexual minority men. Sexual minority women at risk of mental and behavioral health problems (n = 19) and expert providers with this population (n = 12) shaped the treatment's development, including by supporting its primary focus on universal and minority-stress-focused processes underlying this population's disproportionately poor mental and behavioral health. The resulting treatment was then delivered to young adult sexual minority women (n = 60; M age = 25.58; 41.67% racial/ethnic minority; 43.33% transgender/nonbinary) experiencing depression/anxiety and past 90-day heavy alcohol use. Results: Compared to waitlist (n = 30), participants randomized to immediately receive EQuIP (n = 30) experienced significantly reduced depression and anxiety (d = 0.85, 0.86, respectively); effects for alcohol use problems were smaller (d = 0.29) and marginally significant. In pre- to post-intervention pooled analyses, effect sizes for minority stress processes (mean d = .25) and universal risk factors (mean d = .48), through which the treatment was expected to work, were small and moderate, respectively, and in the expected direction. Conclusions: This study provides initial support for a minority-stress-focused transdiagnostic cognitive–behavioral treatment for sexual minority women. These first results can launch exploration of other mechanisms and modalities through which to equip this population with evidence-based support.",2415494336," Evidence Based Healthcare , Journal Article",2020
Mechanisms of change in female-specific and gender-neutral cognitive behavioral therapy for women with alcohol use disorder,"Objective: In a randomized trial for women with alcohol use disorders (AUD), the efficacy of Female-Specific Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (FS-CBT) was compared with Gender-Neutral CBT (GN-CBT; Epstein et al., 2018). The current study examined whether putative mechanisms of change differed between treatment conditions, using a novel statistical approach. Both treatments were hypothesized to work by increasing use of alcohol-related coping skills (coping) and confidence to abstain from drinking (confidence), but FS-CBT additionally targeted female-salient mechanisms: anxiety, depression, sociotropy (i.e., overinvestment in others' opinion of oneself), autonomy, and social networks supportive of abstinence. Method: Ninety-nine women with AUD (55 in GN-CBT, 44 in FS-CBT) completed self-report assessments at baseline and 0, 6, and 12 months posttreatment. Multilevel vector autoregression estimation was used to analyze associations between putative mechanisms of change, and network models of those associations were generated using network analysis. Results: Across conditions, higher confidence and coping were directly associated with less drinking; autonomy was directly and indirectly associated with drinking. Additionally, network analysis indicated that although variation in depression was associated with change in other variables specifically for GN-CBT, sociotropy was associated with change specifically in FS-CBT. Conclusions: Women receiving CBT-AUD changed their drinking through increased confidence to abstain and greater use of coping skills. Autonomy played a central role in behavior change across treatment conditions. Participants receiving treatment tailored to women also changed through decreases in sociotropy and increases in social support for abstinence. For women who received standard CBT, changes in depression were important to clinical improvement.",2404657343, Journal Article,2020
Cognitive Processes Associated With Sudden Gains in Cognitive Therapy for Posttraumatic Stress Disorder in Routine Care,"Objective: Although most studies investigating sudden gains in treatments for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) report a positive association between sudden gains and outcomes at the end of treatment, less is known about sudden gains in routine clinical care and the processes involved in their occurrence. This study investigated changes in cognitive factors (negative appraisals, trauma memory characteristics) before, during, and after sudden gains in PTSD symptom severity. Method: Two samples (N 1 = 248, N 2 = 234) of patients who received trauma-focused cognitive therapy for PTSD in routine clinical care were analyzed. Mahalanobis distance matching, including the propensity score, was used to compare patients with sudden gains and similar patients without sudden gains. Estimates from both samples were meta-analyzed to obtain pooled effects. Results: Patients with sudden gains (N 1 = 76, N 2 = 87) reported better treatment outcomes in PTSD symptom severity, depression, and anxiety at the end of therapy and follow-up than those without sudden gains. No baseline predictors of sudden gains could be reliably identified. During sudden gains, those with sudden gains had greater changes in both cognitive factors than matched patients. Meta-analyses of the two samples showed that negative appraisals had already decreased in the session prior to sudden gains compared with matched patients. Conclusions: The pooled estimates suggest that changes in negative trauma-related appraisals precede sudden gains in PTSD symptoms. The results suggest that interventions that promote change in appraisals may also facilitate sudden gains in therapy.",2389726810, Journal Article,2020
"Longitudinal associations between minority stress, internalizing symptoms, and substance use among sexual and gender minority individuals assigned female at birth","Objective: Sexual and gender minority individuals assigned female at birth (SGM-AFAB) are at increased risk for anxiety, depression, and substance use and problems compared with heterosexual cisgender women. Cross-sectional research has demonstrated that minority stressors are associated with anxiety, depression, and substance use. However, longitudinal research is limited and the examination of prospective associations between minority stressors, mental health, and substance use is even more sparse. Method: We utilized 4 waves of data (6 months between waves) from a diverse (26.0% non-Latinx White; 26.2% gender minorities) longitudinal cohort of 488 SGM-AFAB (16- to 32-years-old at Wave 1) to examine concurrent and prospective associations between 3 minority stressors (internalized stigma, microaggressions, victimization) and anxiety, depression, and alcohol and cannabis use and problems. Results: At the within-person level, results indicated that when SGM-AFAB experienced more minority stressors than usual, they reported more concurrent and prospective anxiety and depression. Additionally, when SGM-AFAB experienced more microaggressions than usual, they were more likely to use alcohol and cannabis, and when they experienced more victimization than usual, they reported more concurrent alcohol and cannabis use problems. No prospective associations between minority stressors and substance use were significant. Conclusions: Findings indicate that minority stressors were consistently associated with internalizing symptoms, both concurrently and prospectively, while evidence for associations between minority stressors and substance use/problems was less consistent. These findings highlight the need for interventions that that teach SGM-AFAB skills for effectively coping with minority stress.",2389726755, Journal Article,2020
Text message safety behavior reduction for social anxiety: A randomized controlled trial,"Objective: Cognitive models of social anxiety disorder propose that maladaptive safety behaviors (SBs; i.e., behaviors intended to avoid, prevent, or manage threat) play an important maintaining role in the disorder. Though targeting these behaviors for elimination is one component of contemporary cognitive–behavioral therapies for social anxiety, it has rarely been examined as a specific treatment strategy, and, to our knowledge, it has not yet been examined in isolation as an intervention for social anxiety. The current study evaluated an SB reduction intervention for social anxiety that consisted of brief text message reminders. Method: Individuals with elevated social anxiety (N = 94) were recruited from across the United States and randomized to receive one of two 1-month text message interventions consisting of 16 text message reminders to avoid SBs or focus on the present. Symptoms were assessed at pre- and posttreatment, as well as at 1-month follow-up. Results: Both treatments were associated with substantial symptom reduction. Compared to the present-focused text message condition, SB elimination led to lower SB frequency at posttreatment (sr² = .044, p = .048) and lower social anxiety at follow-up (sr² = .096, p = .005). Conclusions: These preliminary findings provide novel evidence for the importance of SBs in social anxiety and suggest text message SB reduction may be an effective, highly accessible intervention for individuals with social anxiety.",2389726682," Evidence Based Healthcare , Journal Article",2020
Predicting treatment failure in regular care Internet-Delivered Cognitive Behavior Therapy for depression and anxiety using only weekly symptom measures,"Objective: Therapist guided Internet-Delivered Cognitive Behavior Therapy (ICBT) is effective, but as in traditional CBT, not all patients improve, and clinicians generally fail to identify them early enough. We predict treatment failure in 12-week regular care ICBT for Depression, Panic disorder and Social anxiety disorder, using only patients' weekly symptom ratings to identify when the accuracy of predictions exceed 2 benchmarks: (a) chance, and (b) empirically derived clinician preferences for actionable predictions. Method: Screening, pretreatment and weekly symptom ratings from 4310 regular care ICBT-patients from the Internet Psychiatry Clinic in Stockholm, Sweden was analyzed in a series of regression models each adding 1 more week of data. Final score was predicted in a holdout test sample, which was then categorized into Success or Failure (failure defined as the absence of both remitter and responder status). Classification analyses with Balanced Accuracy and 95% Confidence intervals was then compared to predefined benchmarks. Results: Benchmark 1 (better than chance) was reached 1 week into all treatments. Social anxiety disorder reached Benchmark 2 (&gt; 65%) at week 5, whereas Depression and Panic Disorder reached it at week 6. Conclusions: For depression, social anxiety and panic disorder, prediction with only patient-rated symptom scores can detect treatment failure 6 weeks into ICBT, with enough accuracy for a clinician to take action. Early identification of failing treatment attempts may be a viable way to increase the overall success rate of existing psychological treatments by providing extra clinical resources to at-risk patients, within a so-called Adaptive Treatment Strategy.",2380036990, Journal Article,2020
A randomized clinical trial of mindfulness-based cognitive therapy for women with irritable bowel syndrome-Effects and mechanisms,"Objective: Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a chronic disorder of brain–gut interaction. Previous studies suggest that mindfulness could be therapeutic for IBS patients, however no study has evaluated the effects of mindfulness-based cognitive therapy adapted for patients with IBS (MBCT-IBS). A 6-week MBCT-IBS course was designed to reduce symptoms and increase quality of life. This study aimed to evaluate the effects of MBCT-IBS and to investigate its therapeutic mechanisms in a randomized controlled trial. Method: Sixty-seven female patients with IBS were randomized to MBCT-IBS (MG; n = 36) or a waitlist (WL; n = 31) control condition. Patients completed standardized self-report measures of IBS symptom severity, IBS quality of life, maladaptive illness cognitions (catastrophizing, visceral anxiety sensitivity) and mindfulness at baseline, after 2 treatment sessions, at posttreatment, and at 6-week follow-up. Self-referential processing of illness and health was measured with an implicit association test (IAT). Results: The MG reported significantly greater reductions in IBS symptoms (p = .003) and improvements in quality of life (p &lt; .001) at follow-up compared with the WL. Changes in visceral anxiety sensitivity and pain catastrophizing at posttreatment and reductions in the IAT-score after 2 sessions combined with increases in nonjudgmental awareness at posttreatment mediated reductions in IBS symptoms. Conclusions: MBCT-IBS has the potential to reduce IBS symptoms and increase quality of life. MBCT-IBS may exert its effect on IBS symptoms via reducing maladaptive illness cognitions and activating changes in self-processing (reducing biases in self-referent processing of illness and health and increasing nonjudgmental awareness).",2380036482," Evidence Based Healthcare , Journal Article",2020
A Common Elements Approach to the Development of a Modular Cognitive Behavioral Theory for Chronic Loneliness,"Background: Loneliness is a transdiagnostic clinical phenomenon that can significantly impact mental health and well-being across the lifespan. Objective: The aim was to combine existing theory and evidence-based treatment approaches to propose a comprehensive transdiagnostic cognitive–behavioral analysis of the maintenance of chronic loneliness relevant across disorders, age groups, and populations. Method: A distillation and matching model-framework approach was taken to identify interventions designed to reduce loneliness. Eligible studies were coded for the presence of practice elements. The findings were combined with an analysis of the broader literature on loneliness and psychopathology to derive a comprehensive cognitive–behavioral analysis of the maintenance of loneliness over time across populations. Results: The search yielded 11 studies containing 14 practice elements with relative frequencies ranging from 7% to 64%. The identified practice elements target putative mechanisms such as negative interpersonal appraisals, anxiety, and social skills deficits. Counterproductive behavior and cognitive processes such as self-focused attention were identified as maintenance factors based on the broader literature. A modular transdiagnostic model with multiple pathways is proposed to be consistent with the existing theoretical and treatment literature. Conclusions: Combining the distillation and matching model framework with existing theory from the literature is a novel approach for developing a model of factors that maintain loneliness over time. The model has varying treatment implications for different populations including children with autism spectrum disorders and bereaved older adults. Targeting transdiagnostic processes has the potential to transform interventions for loneliness across a range of formats and settings.",2360026560, Journal Article,2020
A Multimethod Investigation of the Impact of Attentional Control on a Brief Intervention for Anxiety and Depression,"Objective: Anxiety sensitivity (AS; fear of anxiety) is a malleable risk factor for anxiety and depression. Brief computerized interventions, including elements of psychoeducation, interoceptive exposure, and cognitive bias modification (CBM) can reduce anxiety and depression through AS reductions. These interventions are not equally efficacious for all who receive them, suggesting the need to explore moderators. Attentional control (AC), the ability to regulate attentional processes by focusing and shifting attention as needed, has been linked to AS, anxiety, and depression suggesting that it may moderate treatment efficacy. The moderating effects of self-report and neurophysiological (i.e., theta/beta ratio, occipital alpha power) indices associated with AC processes on a brief AS-focused intervention were examined. Method: Participants (M age = 36.43, SD = 16.47; 57.5% female) were randomized to cognitive AS treatment (n = 67) or a repeated contact control (n = 60). Results: Occipital alpha power moderated the rate of change in AS across three weekly treatment sessions as well as the effects of the intervention on anxiety and depression symptoms at the 1-month follow-up. Lower alpha power was associated with a swifter reduction in AS symptoms and marginally lower levels of anxiety and depression at follow-up. AC indices were not correlated with each other. Conclusions: These findings present a novel hypothesis that lower AC as indexed by occipital alpha power might increase treatment gains in the context of a brief transdiagnostic treatment for anxiety and depression. These findings also highlight the need for external validity studies of AC indices.",2360026305, Journal Article,2020
Effects of Modifying Interpretation Bias on Transdiagnostic Repetitive Negative Thinking,"Objective: Repetitive negative thinking (RNT; e.g., worry and rumination) is common across emotional disorders, as is the tendency to generate negative interpretations (interpretation bias). Ameliorating negative interpretations via cognitive bias modification of interpretations (CBM-I) reduces worry/rumination, and improves mood in people diagnosed with generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) or depression. We investigated whether these findings generalize to high worry or rumination populations, irrespective of diagnosis, and whether effects are increased by enhancing emotional engagement with training with active generation of positive resolutions of ambiguity and imagery. Method: Community volunteers with excessive worry and/or rumination, who were above clinical cut-off on anxiety and/or depression measures, were allocated to an active control condition (n = 54), interpretation training condition with prior activation of RNT (CBM_RNT; n = 54), or training condition augmented with positive outcome generation and imagery (CBM_ENH; n = 53). Interpretation bias, RNT, and mood were assessed before and following 10 Internet-based sessions completed within a 1-month period. RNT and mood questionnaires were also completed at 1-month follow-up. Results: After training, both forms of CBM-I (vs. control) facilitated more positive interpretations and reduced negative intrusions during a worry task. At 1-month follow-up, anxiety, depression, RNT, and worry in the past week were lower in the CBM-I than control conditions, but not rumination or trait worry. Compared with standard CBM-I, the augmented form facilitated more positive interpretations, reduced negative intrusions after training, and reduced trait rumination at 1-month follow-up, but it did not augment effects on trait worry, anxiety or depression. Conclusions: Interpretation bias maintains transdiagnostic RNT and Internet-based CBM-I can reduce longer-term RNT.",2360025826, Journal Article,2020
The Breadth and Potency of Transdiagnostic Cognitive Risks for Psychopathology in Youth,"Objective: Multiple cognitive risks from different theoretical paradigms (dysfunctional attitudes, negative inferential style, self-criticism, dependency, brooding) predict depression, but may be transdiagnostic vulnerabilities for multiple psychopathologies. Risk factors can be identified as broadly transdiagnostic and relatively specific to psychopathological outcomes by organizing the common and specific aspects of each respective construct using latent bifactor models, and by examining links between dimensions of risk and psychopathology. This study evaluated (a) whether a bifactor model of cognitive vulnerabilities, including a general cognitive risk dimension (c factor) and several specific dimensions replicated in early adolescents (M age = 13.50 years) and extended to younger and older youth, and (b) how the general and specific cognitive risk dimensions related to the general psychopathology (p factor) and internalizing- and externalizing-specific dimensions. Method: Community youth (N = 571; 55% female) reported on cognitive risks; youth and a caregiver reported on psychopathologies (depression, anxiety, aggression, conduct, attention problems). Results: The cognitive risk bifactor model showed good fit and slight advantages over a correlated factors model. The bifactor model exhibited invariance across development and captured key associations that were identified when each individual cognitive risk was related to the bifactor model of psychopathology. The c factor strongly related to internalizing-specific, and moderately to the p factor and externalizing-specific dimensions. Specific cognitive risk dimensions (brooding, negative inferential style, dependency) related to all psychopathology dimensions. Conclusion: A general cognitive vulnerability (c factor) transdiagnostically associates with a breadth of psychopathologies and most potently to internalizing-specific among youth.",2360024947, Journal Article,2020
Who benefits the most from cognitive change in cognitive therapy of depression? A study of interpersonal factors,"Objective: Research suggests that decreases in negative cognitions coincide with symptom improvements over the course of cognitive therapy (CT) of depression, but the role cognitive change (CC) plays in reducing symptoms remains controversial. Method: A total of 126 adults (mean age = 31.7, SD = 13.35; 60% female; 83% Caucasian) participated in CT for depression. Patients completed the Beck Depression Inventory–II and the Immediate Cognitive Change Scale at each session. At intake evaluation, maladaptive personality traits (Personality Inventory for DSM–5, Brief Form) and interpersonal problems (Inventory of Interpersonal Problems, Short Version) were assessed via self-report, and social skills were assessed through patients' evaluation of their performance following a series of behavioral role-plays (standardized interaction task). To rule out between-patient differences as potential confounds, our model disaggregated within- and between-patient components of CC and depression scores. Results: Within-patient CC significantly predicted within-patient change in depressive symptoms. This relation was moderated by patients' evaluations of their social skills and patients' level of interpersonal problems, with CC predicting symptoms more robustly for patients with fewer perceived social skills and for those with greater interpersonal problems. Maladaptive personality traits did not emerge as a moderator. Additional analyses showed the relation of CC and symptom change was particularly strong among those with social anxiety disorder and among those observers rated as having lower social skills. Conclusions: CC in CT sessions appears to foster subsequent depressive symptom reduction, especially among patients with lower levels of self-evaluated social skills and greater interpersonal problems.",2348317906, Journal Article,2020
Effects of Safety Behavior Fading on Appearance Concerns and Related Symptoms,"Objective: Appearance-related safety behaviors (SBs; e.g., mirror checking, grooming) have been implicated in body dysmorphic disorder (BDD), eating disorders, and social anxiety disorder. The proposed project aimed to extend previous research efforts by exploring the experimental effects of reducing engagement in appearance-related SBs on appearance concerns and related symptoms. Method: Eighty-four undergraduate female participants with elevated appearance concerns were randomly assigned to a SB fading group or a no instructions control group. For 2 weeks, participants in the SB fading condition were sent daily reminders via text message to decrease their engagement in appearance-related SBs, whereas participants in the control group completed assessments only. Self-report assessments of study variables of interest were administered at baseline, midmanipulation, postmanipulation, and 2-week follow-up. Participants also completed an appearance-related in vivo stressor task at post, during which participants rated their reactivity to having their photographs taken from various angles. Results: Compared to the control group, the SB fading group exhibited significantly lower social anxiety, BDD symptoms, body dissatisfaction, and maladaptive cognitions at the postmanipulation and follow-up assessments. SB fading had stronger effects on BDD symptoms at postmanipulation among those high versus those low in baseline BDD symptoms. The SB fading group also showed less reactivity to some aspects of the in vivo appearance-related stressor task. Conclusions: This study provides strong evidence for the importance of appearance-related SBs in the maintenance of BDD and other disorders characterized by body image disturbances. Findings point to the potential utility of decreasing appearance-related SBs as a transdiagnostic treatment strategy.",2332079141, Journal Article,2020
Social Phobia Moderates the Outcome in the EVIDENT Study: A Randomized Controlled Trial on an Internet-Based Psychological Intervention for Mild to Moderate Depressive Symptoms,"Objective: Data from the EVIDENT trial were reanalyzed to examine whether specific anxiety-related comorbidities moderate the effect of an Internet intervention on depression outcome. Method: The EVIDENT study is a randomized controlled trial that included N = 1,013 participants with mild to moderate depressive symptoms (i.e., scores between 5 and 14 on the Patient Health Questionnaire−9 [PHQ-9]) who were randomized to a control group with access to care-as-usual (n = 504) or to an intervention group, which accessed the Internet intervention Deprexis adjunctively to care-as-usual (n = 509). Anxiety-related comorbidities (generalized anxiety disorder, social phobia, panic disorder, agoraphobia, panic disorder with agoraphobia, specific phobia, posttraumatic stress disorder, obsessive–compulsive disorder) were assessed with the Web Screening Questionnaire at baseline. Multilevel models were performed. Results: Twelve potential moderators (8 specific anxiety-related comorbidities, depression severity, and 3 previously identified moderators in the EVIDENT trial) were examined within 1 multilevel model, and only social phobia moderated the intervention effect on depression outcome (in favor of Deprexis). This moderating effect of social phobia did not depend on the other moderators' being included in the model. These results emerged for continuous PHQ-9 scores as well as for clinically important PHQ-9 changes as outcome (p &lt; .05). However, moderating effects did not reach small effect sizes, accounted for less than 1% of the variance in change in depressive symptoms, and showed limited reproducibility in randomly selected split halves. Conclusions: Deprexis appears to be most effective for participants with mild to moderate depressive symptoms and comorbid social phobia, but further replications of this finding are necessary.",2332078874," Evidence Based Healthcare , Journal Article",2020
Hostile and Harmful: Structural Stigma and Minority Stress Explain Increased Anxiety Among Migrants Living in the United Kingdom After the Brexit Referendum,"Objective: The extent to which the outcome of the European Union referendum (""Brexit"") has affected the mental health of migrants living in the United Kingdom has been the subject of much speculation. However, no empirical attempts to examine the mental health impact of the Brexit vote have been made. Through the combination of structural stigma and minority stress theories, this study examined the extent to which the outcome of the Brexit referendum was associated with the mental health of migrants in the United Kingdom as a result of increased discrimination. Method: Adult migrants living in the United Kingdom (N = 311) participated in a longitudinal survey containing measures of discrimination and symptoms of generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) at baseline and at 1-month and 6-month follow-ups. Participant data were matched to official voting records at the electorate level. Results: The percentage of ""leave"" voters where participants lived was associated with increased discrimination, which was in turn associated with increased GAD symptoms, including the likelihood of experiencing clinically significant GAD symptoms over the course of the study (OR = 3.01, 95% confidence interval [CI: 1.25, 7.33]). The percentage of leave voters where participants lived was associated with increased GAD symptoms indirectly via increased discrimination (standardized indirect effect = .12; 95% bias-corrected CI [.07, .19]). Conclusions: This study demonstrates that voter referenda can have a detrimental impact on migrants' mental health. Findings illustrate how aspects of structural stigma can produce experiences of minority stress, which can lead to negative mental health outcomes for members of marginalized populations.",2332077876, Journal Article,2020
The working alliance in manualized CBT for generalized anxiety disorder: Does it lead to change and does the effect vary depending on manual implementation flexibility?,"Objective: The investigation of session-to-session effects of working alliance on symptoms and coping experiences in patients diagnosed with generalized anxiety disorder. In addition, investigating these effects dependent on whether therapists are primed to work with patients strength (resource priming) or to adhere to the treatment manual (adherence priming). Method: Data was drawn from a randomized controlled trial in which 57 patients were randomly assigned to either the resource priming condition or the adherence priming condition. Within- and between patient associations were disentangled using dynamic structural equation modeling. Results: The total score of the working alliance, as well as all its overlapping components (i.e., goal agreement, task consensus, bond) showed significant within-patient effects on next session coping experiences. More specifically, better alliance scores in one session were followed by more coping experiences in the subsequent session. With regard to anxiety symptoms, an association was found only with the working alliance total score as well as for the bonds component, but not for the goals and task components of the working alliance. The priming condition (resource priming vs. adherence priming) had no influence on the within-patient alliance–outcome association. Between-patient alliance associations were only present with coping experiences, but not with anxiety symptoms. Conclusion: The findings provide further empirical evidence for the hypothesis that the working alliance may be a robust facilitative factor for change in CBT treatments for generalized anxiety disorder, which evolves irrespective of the strictness with which therapists adhere to the treatment manual.",2309766152, Journal Article,2019
Integrating addiction medicine into rural primary care: Strategies and initial outcomes,"Objective: This retrospective study describes the role of behavioral health in an addiction medicine program integrated in a primary care clinic, and evaluates retention, substance use, and mental health symptoms for patients in a rural underserved community. Method: Data were abstracted from records of patients referred for buprenorphine treatment of opioid use disorder (N = 101; 45% female, 23% Native Hawaiian or Pacific Islander, Mage = 42.5, SD = 12.75). Among patients prescribed buprenorphine (n = 61), most had comorbid substance-related diagnoses (72% with tobacco use, 75% with at least one other substance use disorder) and non-substance-related mental health diagnoses (77%), most commonly depression and anxiety. Integrated sessions with a behavioral health provider and a buprenorphine-waivered prescriber occurred weekly to monthly. Participants completed depression and anxiety questionnaires (Patient Health Questionnaire-9 and Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale-7) and provided urine samples at each visit. Results: Most patients (72%) were retained for at least 3 months, with early dropout associated with higher initial depression and anxiety scores. Inconsistent urine drug tests (i.e., those positive for illicit/nonprescribed substances) were significantly more common at treatment initiation (74%) than during the most recent visit (43%, p &lt; .001), and were associated with baseline substance and other mental health factors, as well as shorter treatment duration. Generalized estimating equations models suggested time-based improvements in depression and anxiety symptoms, especially for patients retained for at least 3 months. Conclusions: Integrating wraparound addiction treatment within a rural primary care setting is feasible and associated with improved mental health and retention outcomes.",2300168209, Journal Article,2019
Opioid use before and after completion of an online pain management program,"Objective: The purpose of this study was to examine the effect of a pain management course that has demonstrated efficacy in pain reduction on the use of opioid medication. Method: Self-reported medication use was recorded at baseline assessment for all patients enrolled in a validated pain management program provided free by a university research clinic (N = 471). Participants were randomized either to receive immediate treatment or to be a wait-list control. Opioid use at baseline assessment, with the daily doses converted to morphine equivalents, was compared with the self-reported opioid medication use at posttreatment and 3-month follow-up. The relationship between opioid use and measures of psychological symptoms, pain, and disability was examined. Results: At assessment, 85% (n = 399) reported taking some form of pain modifying or psychotropic medication, 43.1% (n = 203) reported regular opioid use and 22.9% (n = 108) reported taking additional as required (pro re nata, or PRN) opioid-containing medication. On completion, there were significant reductions in the number who reported taking regular opioids and a large reduction in the use of PRN opioids and in the reported doses of opioids. Those reductions were more strongly associated with reductions in symptoms of anxiety and depression than in measures of disability and pain. Conclusions: The reduction in the self-reported use of regular and PRN opioid pain-relieving medication following completion of an online pain management program with demonstrated efficacy in pain reduction appeared to be related to effective treatment of symptoms of anxiety and depression.",2300160431, Journal Article,2019
Internet-Delivered Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy for Significant Others of Treatment-Refusing Problem Gamblers: A Randomized Wait-List Controlled Trial,"Objective: Problem gambling can cause severe harm to concerned significant others (CSOs) in the form of, for example, relationship problems, financial difficulties, and mental and physical illness. CSOs are important for their ability to support problem gamblers and motivate them to change. This study investigated the effect of an Internet-based intervention for CSOs of treatment-refusing problem gamblers on (a) gambling-related harm, (b) the gamblers' treatment-seeking rate, and (c) the relationship satisfaction and mental health of the CSOs. Method: A total of 100 CSOs of problem gamblers were randomized into one of two conditions: Internet-delivered cognitive–behavioral therapy for CSOs or a wait-list control group. The intervention group was given Internet-based treatment consisting of nine modules with therapist support available via telephone and e-mail. Outcome measures were collected up 12 months posttreatment. Results: The intervention improved the psychological well-being of the CSOs compared to the wait-list group at the posttest (CSO's emotional consequences: d = −0.90, 95% CI [−1.47, −0.33]; relationship satisfaction: d = 0.41, 95% CI [0.05, 0.76]; anxiety: d = −0.45, 95% CI [−0.81, −0.09]; depression: d = −0.49, 95% CI [−0.82, −0.16]). However, the effects on the gambling outcomes were small and inconclusive (gambling losses: multiplicative effect = 0.73, 95% CI [0.29, 1.85]; treatment-seeking: hazard ratio = 0.86, 95% CI [0.31, 2.38]). Conclusion: The results confirm earlier studies' findings that affecting the gambler via a CSO is challenging, but it is possible to increase the CSO's coping and well-being.

GROUPS 4 HEALTH Reduces Loneliness and Social Anxiety in Adults With Psychological Distress: Findings From a Randomized Controlled Trial,"Objective: Loneliness is a key public health issue for which various interventions have been trialed. However, few directly target the core feature of loneliness-lack of belonging. This is the focus of GROUPS 4 HEALTH (G4H), a recently developed intervention that targets the development and maintenance of social group memberships to support health. Method: To investigate the efficacy of this intervention, a randomized controlled trial was conducted with participants (N = 120) assigned to G4H or treatment-as-usual (TAU) by computer software. Assessment of primary (loneliness) and secondary (depression, social anxiety, general practitioner visits, multiple group membership) outcomes was conducted at baseline and 2-month follow-up using mixed-model repeated-measures analyses. Results: G4H produced a greater reduction in loneliness (d = −1.04) and social anxiety (d = −0.46) than TAU (d = −0.33 and d = 0.03, respectively). G4H was also associated with fewer general practitioner visits at follow-up (d = −0.33) and a stronger sense of belonging to multiple groups (d = 0.52) relative to TAU (d = 0.30 and d = 0.33, respectively). Depression declined significantly in both G4H (d = −0.63) and TAU (d = −0.34), but follow-up analyses showed this was greater in G4H among those not receiving adjunct psychopharmacological treatment and whose symptoms were milder. Conclusions: Findings suggest that G4H can be a useful way to treat loneliness and highlight the importance of attending to group memberships when tackling this important social challenge.",2281141866," Evidence Based Healthcare , Journal Article",2019
Intensive group behavioral treatment (IGBT) for children with selective mutism: A preliminary randomized clinical trial,"Objective: Very few controlled trials have evaluated targeted treatment methods for childhood selective mutism (SM); the availability of evidence-based services remains limited. This study is the first controlled trial to evaluate an intensive group behavioral treatment (IGBT) for children with SM. Method: Twenty-nine children with SM (5–9 years; 76% female; 35% ethnic minority) were randomized to immediate SM 5-day IGBT or to a 4-week waitlist with psychoeducational resources (WLP), and were assessed at Week 4 and again 8 weeks into the following school year. Results: IGBT was associated with high satisfaction and low perceived barriers to treatment participation. At Week 4, 50% of the immediate IGBT condition and 0% of the WLP condition were classified as ""clinical responders."" Further, Time × Condition interactions were significant for social anxiety severity, verbal behavior in social situations, and global functioning (but not for SM severity, verbal behavior in home settings, or overall anxiety). School-year follow-up assessments revealed significant improvements across all outcomes. Eight weeks into the following school year, 46% of IGBT-treated children were free of an SM diagnosis. In addition, teachers in the post-IGBT school year rated less school impairment and more classroom verbal behavior relative to teachers in the pre-IGBT school year. Conclusions: Findings provide the first empirical support for the efficacy and acceptability of IGBT for SM. Further study is needed to examine mechanisms of IGBT response, and other effective SM treatment methods, in order to clarify which treatment formats work best for which affected children.",2271769557," Evidence Based Healthcare , Journal Article",2019
A randomized clinical trial evaluating the efficacy of a brief alcohol intervention supplemented with a substance-free activity session or relaxation training,"Objective: Behavioral economic theory suggests that a reduction in alcohol use is most likely when there is an increase in rewarding substance-free activities. Anxiety has also been linked to heavy drinking, and strategies to reduce anxiety may enhance alcohol interventions. The goal of this 2-site randomized controlled clinical trial was to evaluate the efficacy of a brief alcohol intervention that was supplemented with either a behavioral economic substance-free activity session (SFAS) or a relaxation training (Relaxation training [RT]) session. Method: Participants were 393 college students (61% female, mean age = 18.77 years) who reported 2 or more past-month heavy drinking episodes. Participants were randomized to 1 of 3 conditions: (a) assessment; (b) alcohol brief motivational intervention (BMI) plus SFAS; or (c) BMI plus RT. Both treatment conditions included 2 in-person sessions plus a phone booster session. Outcomes were evaluated 1-, 6-, 12-, and 16-months postintervention. Results: Generalized linear mixed models indicated that the combination of a BMI plus either the SFAS or RT was associated with significant reductions in alcohol use and problems across the 16-month follow-up compared with assessment only. There were no significant differences between the two active treatment conditions. Changes in proportional reinforcement from substance-related activities, and protective behavioral strategies mediated treatment effects. Conclusion: Two-session (plus booster) interventions that combine BMI and either substance-free activity enhancement or RT can result in enduring reductions in alcohol misuse among college drinkers.",2256516678," Evidence Based Healthcare , Journal Article",2019
Sexual orientation differences in psychological treatment outcomes for depression and anxiety: National cohort study,"Objective: This study investigates whether sexual minority patients have poorer treatment outcomes than heterosexual patients in England's Improving Access to Psychological Therapies (IAPT) services. These services provide evidence-based psychological interventions for people with depression or anxiety. Method: National routinely collected data were analyzed for a cohort who had attended at least 2 treatment sessions and were discharged between April 2013–March, 2015. Depression, anxiety and functional impairment were compared for 85,831 women (83,482 [97.2%] heterosexual; 1,285 [1.5%] lesbian; 1,064 [1.2%] bisexual) and 47,092 men (44,969 [95.5%] heterosexual; 1,734 [3.7%] gay; 389 [0.8%] bisexual). Linear and logistic models were fitted adjusting for baseline scores, and sociodemographic and treatment characteristics. Results: Compared to heterosexual women, lesbian and bisexual women had higher final-session severity for depression, anxiety, and functional impairment and increased risk of not attaining reliable recovery in depression/anxiety or functioning (aORs 1.3–1.4) and reliable improvement in depression/anxiety or functioning (aORs 1.2–1.3). Compared to heterosexual and gay men, bisexual men had higher final-session severity for depression, anxiety, and functioning and increased risk of not attaining reliable recovery for depression/anxiety or functioning (aORs 1.5–1.7) and reliable improvement in depression/anxiety or functioning (aORs 1.3–1.4). Gay and heterosexual men did not differ on treatment outcomes. Racial minority lesbian/gay or bisexual patients did not have significantly different outcomes to their White lesbian/gay or bisexual counterparts. Conclusions: The reasons for treatment outcome inequities for bisexual patients and lesbian women (e.g., 30–70% increased risk of not recovering) need investigation. Health services should address these inequalities.",2256514809, Journal Article,2019
Internalizing symptoms and cannabis and alcohol use: Between- and within-person risk pathways with coping motives,"Objective: To test reciprocal associations among internalizing symptoms (depression and social anxiety), using alcohol and cannabis to cope, and use-related problems. Method: The study utilized a community sample (N = 387, 55% female; majority non-Hispanic Caucasian (83.1%) or African American (9.1%) and a longitudinal design that spanned 17 to 20 years of age, and distinguished within- and between-person associations using latent curve models with structured residuals. Results: Reciprocal prospective within-person associations were supported for alcohol, such that elevated depression symptoms were associated with increased alcohol coping motivates 1 year later, which, in turn, was associated with subsequent increased depression symptoms. Bidirectional associations were not supported for social anxiety, although high levels of social anxiety were associated with elevated levels of coping drinking 1 year later. Cannabis coping motives were associated with exacerbation of depression, but not social anxiety symptoms, 1 year later. Between- and within-person contemporaneous associations suggested that depression and social anxiety were more strongly associated with coping than social/enhancement motives, and that coping motives were associated with use-related problems. Conclusion: Findings suggest that alcohol coping motivates exacerbate rather than ameliorate depression symptoms, which, in turn, leads to greater reliance on alcohol to cope. There was more consistent support for associations with substance use-related problems for depression than for social anxiety. Both between- and within-person associations may be useful for identifying targets and timing of coping-oriented interventions.",2256512419, Journal Article,2019
Positive affect treatment for depression and anxiety: A randomized clinical trial for a core feature of anhedonia,"Objective: Loss of pleasure or interest in activities (i.e., anhedonia) is a risk factor for suicidality, treatment nonresponse, and relapse. Extant treatments that focus on reducing negative affect have limited effects upon positive affect (a core feature of anhedonia). We investigated whether a novel intervention aimed at increasing reward sensitivity was more efficacious for positive affect than a cognitive–behavior treatment aimed at reducing threat sensitivity, in individuals with clinically severe symptoms of depression or anxiety, and functional impairment. Method: The Treatment for Affective Dimensions trial was offered in a 2-site randomized study at outpatient treatment centers in Los Angeles and Dallas. Ninety-six patients were randomized to 15 weekly, individual sessions of Positive Affect Treatment (PAT) or Negative Affect Treatment (NAT). The primary outcome was improvement in positive affect (Positive and Negative Affect Schedule–Positive) from pretreatment to 6-month follow-up (6MFU). Secondary outcomes were improvements in negative affect (Positive and Negative Affect Schedule–Negative), suicidal ideation, and symptoms (Depression Anxiety Stress Scales). Results: PAT resulted in greater improvements in positive affect, p = .009, d = .52, and higher positive affect at 6MFU, p = .002, d = .67, than NAT. Participants in PAT also reported lower negative affect, p = .033, d = .52, and lower symptoms of depression, p = .035, d = .34, anxiety, p &lt; .018, d = .30, and stress, p = .006, d = .43 at 6MFU. Finally, probability of suicidal ideation at 6MFU was lower in PAT than NAT (1.7% vs. 12.0%), p &lt; .001. Conclusions: Compared to NAT, PAT demonstrated better outcomes (at 6MFU) on positive affect, depression, anxiety, stress, and suicidal ideation, for patients with symptomatic pretreatment levels of these outcomes.",2240141820," Evidence Based Healthcare , Journal Article",2019
Interpersonal change as a mediator of the within- and between-patient alliance-outcome association in two treatments for generalized anxiety disorder,"Objective: Although a better therapeutic alliance associates with treatment outcome, it may do so in different ways. For example, alliance quality may promote improvement as it shifts over time (within-patient changes); alternatively, alliance quality may also, or instead, influence outcome when generally higher or lower for some patients relative to others (between-patient differences). Although both components have been linked to patient improvement, the distinct mechanisms of these associations have been rarely examined. Conceptually, it follows that within-patient alliance fluctuations (representing the changing nature of a current relationship intended to be ameliorative) may facilitate other interpersonal improvements that could, in turn, translate into symptom reduction. This path squares with the corrective relational experience notion. In contrast, whereas as patients’ average alliances across therapy may generally facilitate or hinder improvement, the mechanism may not be other relationship functioning. This squares with the notion that when people generally experience good alliances with their therapist, it may reflect an existing relational ability that catalyzes the effectiveness of other nonrelational therapeutic means. This study tested these distinct hypotheses. Method: Patients (N = 85) with generalized anxiety disorder were randomly assigned to cognitive–behavioral therapy, either alone or integrated with motivational interviewing. They rated alliance quality, interpersonal problems, and outcome repeatedly. Results: Using multilevel structural equation modeling, both within- and between-patient alliances related to subsequent worry reduction. As predicted, change in interpersonal problems mediated the association only at the within-patient level. Conclusions: Results contribute to the literature on mechanisms of the within- and between-person alliance-outcome association.",2240141796, Journal Article,2019
What’s in a name? Branding of online mental health programming for university students,"Objective: University students experience many help-seeking barriers, and thus not all students who could benefit from mental health services enroll in them. This study aimed to examine student enrollment in response to strategic marketing of an online prevention program for anxiety and depression. Method: Data were collected from students at two universities during recruitment phases for the online program. The program was branded as either “The Happiness Challenge” or “ReBoot Camp” through parallel sets of recruitment materials using language intended to address help-seeking barrier concerns (e.g., stigma, inaccessibility). The yielded samples were examined for unaddressed psychological need rates, demographic composition, and differential enrollment by student subgroups into either program brand. Results: Replicated results between Study 1 (n = 651 students; 71.2% undergraduate, 80.3% female, 27.9% White non-Hispanic) and Study 2 (n = 718 students; 60.6% undergraduate, 73.4% female, 53.2% White non-Hispanic) showed that more than a third of students qualified as having “unmet need” for services, enrollment was disproportionately self-identified as female and Asian students, Asian students were less likely to report prior service use and more likely to be categorized as having “unmet need,” and ReBoot Camp was disproportionately selected by male students. Conclusion: Findings suggest that recruitment effectively reached students with unaddressed mental health need, including high enrollment by Asian students, who historically seek services less often. Additionally, important gender differences emerged in preferences for program name. These findings could inform how to market services in university settings to reach more students, including those from underserved subgroups.",2240140771, Journal Article,2019
Time-varying moderation of treatment outcomes by illness duration and comorbid depression in generalized anxiety disorder,"Objective: To extend the sparse literature on moderators, we used time-varying effect modeling (TVEM; Tan, Shiyko, Li, Li, &amp; Dierker, 2012) to examine how depressive symptoms and duration of generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) moderated effects of 3 treatments for GAD (applied relaxation [AR], cognitive–behavioral therapy [CBT], and nondirective therapy [ND]) over time using intensive repeated measures. Method: In a secondary analysis of Borkovec and Costello (1993), 66 GAD clients were randomly assigned to AR (n = 23), CBT (n = 23), or ND (n = 20). Clients received 12 therapy sessions over 6 weeks, and after 2 weeks of posttreatment assessment, had 2 additional weekly fading sessions. They completed thrice daily anxiety ratings during this 10-week period. GAD duration (Anxiety Disorders Interview Schedule-Revised) and depressive symptoms (Hamilton Depression Rating Scale) were assessed at baseline. Results: Longer GAD duration predicted less anxiety reduction in CBT and ND relative to AR. These effects were pronounced in the later phase of treatment, suggesting benefits of focused relaxation practice for clients with longer duration. Higher depression predicted better response to CBT than AR and ND. The moderation effects were also more noticeable in the later phase. In multilevel analyses, a similar moderation pattern held at 1-year follow-up on clinician-rated measures. Conclusion: GAD clients with long-standing symptoms may benefit more from repeatedly practicing fewer skills than learning multiple skills. On the other hand, clients with comorbid depression may respond better to CBT than AR, perhaps because CBT includes cognitive interventions that can generalize to depression.",2240141762, Journal Article,2019
An Internet-based controlled trial of interpretation bias modification versus progressive muscle relaxation for body dysmorphic disorder,"Objective: The current study extended upon previous research efforts by evaluating the utility and feasibility of an 8-session Internet-based interpretation bias modification (IBM) training protocol targeting evaluation- and appearance-related threat biases characteristic of the disorder compared to a progressive muscle relaxation (PMR) condition for treatment of body dysmorphic disorder (BDD). Method: Fifty participants with BDD were recruited from across the United States and randomly assigned to eight sessions of either IBM or PMR. Assessments of interpretation bias, BDD symptoms, depression, and anxiety were administered at pretreatment, 1-week posttreatment, and 3-month follow-up. Results: Compared to the PMR group, individuals in the IBM condition reported less negative/threat interpretation biases and greater positive/benign interpretation biases at posttreatment and follow-up. There were no significant differences between groups with regard to BDD symptoms, depression, or anxiety. Clinically significant improvement was common in both conditions (IBM = 64.0%; PMR = 52.0%), though it did not differ between them. Conclusions: Contrary to our hypothesis, IBM did not outperform PMR with regard to BDD symptom reduction, though both treatments yielded significant improvements on symptom outcomes. Findings suggest that IBM and/or PMR may be promising treatment strategies for BDD, perhaps adjunctively. Overall, these findings provide helpful future directions for IBM research and provide an additional lens through which to examine its potential effectiveness for BDD.",2240138873, Journal Article,2019
Prevention of anxiety and depression in school children: Effectiveness of the transdiagnostic EMOTION program,"Objective: The objective of the study was to examine the effectiveness of a transdiagnostic program (EMOTION, Coping Kids Managing Anxiety and Depression) targeting symptoms of anxiety and depression in schoolchildren by comparing the intervention condition (EC) to a control condition (CC). Method: A clustered randomized design was used with schools as the unit of randomization. Children (N = 1686) aged 8–12 years in 36 schools completed screening using the Multidimensional Anxiety Scale (MASC-Child) and The Mood and Feelings Questionnaire Short version (SMFQ-Child). Scoring 1 SD above a population-based mean on anxiety and/or depression, 873 children were invited to participate. Intent-to-treat analyses were performed, and mixed-effects models were used. Results: Analyses revealed significant reductions of anxious and depressive symptoms as reported by the children, in which children in the intervention condition EC had almost twice the reduction in symptoms compared with the control condition CC. For parent report of the child’s depressive symptoms, there was a significant decrease of symptoms in the intervention condition EC compared with CC. However, parents did not report a significant decrease in anxious symptoms in the intervention condition EC as compared with CC. Conclusion: A transdiagnostic prevention program, provided in schools, was successful in reducing youth-reported symptoms of anxiety and depression and parent-reported depression. The EMOTION program has the potential to reduce the incidence of anxious and depressive disorders in youth.",2183627508, Journal Article,2019
Strengthening resilience in military officer cadets: A group-randomized controlled trial of coping and emotion regulatory self-reflection training,"Objective: This group-randomized control trial examined the efficacy of guided coping and emotion regulatory self-reflection as a means to strengthen resilience by testing the effects of the training on anxiety and depression symptoms and perceived stressor frequency after an intensive stressor period. Method: The sample was 226 officer cadets training at the Royal Military College, Australia. Cadets were randomized by platoon to the self-reflection (n = 130) or coping skills training (n = 96). Surveys occurred at 3 time points: baseline, immediately following the final reflective session (4-weeks postbaseline), and longer-term follow-up (3-months postinitial follow-up). Results: There were no significant baseline differences in demographic or outcome variables between the intervention groups. On average, cadets commenced the resilience training with mild depression and anxiety symptoms. Analyses were conducted at the individual-level after exploring group-level effects. No between-groups differences were observed at initial follow-up. At longer-term follow-up, improvements in mental health outcomes were observed for the self-reflection group, compared with the coping skills group, on depression (Cohen’s d = 0.55; 95% CI [0.24, 0.86]), anxiety symptoms (Cohen’s d = 0.69; 95% CI [0.37, 1.00]), and perceived stressor frequency (Cohen’s d = 0.46; 95% CI [0.15, 0.77]). Longitudinal models demonstrated a time by condition interaction for depression and anxiety, but there was only an effect of condition for perceived stressor frequency. Mediation analyses supported an indirect effect of the intervention on both anxiety and depression via perceived stressor frequency. Conclusions: Findings provide initial support for the use of guided self-reflection as an alternative to coping skills approaches to resilience training.",2183619042," Evidence Based Healthcare , Journal Article",2019
Trajectories and predictors of response in youth anxiety CBT: Integrative data analysis,"Objective: Integrative data analysis was used to combine existing data from nine trials of cognitive–behavioral therapy (CBT) for anxious youth (N = 832) and identify trajectories of symptom change and predictors of trajectories. Method: Youth- and parent-reported anxiety symptoms were combined using item-response theory models. Growth mixture modeling assessed for trajectories of treatment response across pre-, mid-, and posttreatment and 1-year follow-up. Pretreatment client demographic and clinical traits and treatment modality (individual- and family-based CBT) were examined as predictors of trajectory classes. Results: Growth mixture modeling supported three trajectory classes based on parent-reported symptoms: steady responders, rapid responders, and delayed improvement. A 4-class model was supported for youth-reported symptoms: steady responders, rapid responders, delayed improvement, and low-symptom responders. Delayed improvement classes were predicted by higher number of diagnoses (parent and youth report). Receiving family CBT predicted membership in the delayed improvement class compared to all other classes and membership in the steady responder class compared with rapid responders (youth report). Rapid responders were predicted by older age (parent report) and higher number of diagnoses (parent report). Low-symptom responders were more likely to be male (youth report). Conclusions: Integrative data analysis identified distinct patterns of symptom change. Diagnostic complexity, age, gender, and treatment modality differentiated response classes.",2183618852, Journal Article,2019
Interpretation training to target repetitive negative thinking in generalized anxiety disorder and depression,"Objective: Repetitive negative thinking (RNT) for example, worry in generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) and rumination in depression, is often targeted during psychological treatments. To test the hypothesis that negative interpretation bias contributes to worry and rumination, we assessed the effects of inducing more positive interpretations in reducing RNT. Method: Volunteers diagnosed with GAD (66) or depression (65) were randomly allocated to one of two versions of cognitive bias modification for interpretation (CBM-I), either with or without RNT priming prior to training, or a control condition, each involving 10 Internet-delivered sessions. Outcome measures of interpretation bias, a behavioral RNT task and self-reported worry, rumination, anxiety and depression were obtained at baseline, after home-based training and at 1-month follow-up (self-report questionnaires only). Results: CBM-I training, across diagnostic groups, promoted a more positive interpretation bias and led to reductions in worry, rumination, and depressive symptoms, which were maintained at follow-up. Anxiety symptoms were reduced only in the GAD group at follow-up. There were no differences between CBM-I versions; brief priming of RNT did not influence CBM-I effectiveness. Level of interpretation bias post training partially mediated the effects of CBM-I on follow-up questionnaire scores. Conclusions: In contrast to some recent failures to demonstrate improvements following Internet-delivered CBM, we found that self-reported RNT and negative mood were reduced by CBM-I. This is consistent with a causal role for negative interpretation bias in both worry and rumination, suggesting a useful role for CBM-I within treatments for anxiety and depression.",2153617574, Journal Article,2018
Sustaining attendance at a mental health service: A randomized controlled trial,"Objective: A substantial proportion of psychotherapeutic treatments are prematurely terminated because the client discontinues attendance. Interventions have been developed to reduce premature termination, but these are only moderately effective and often place considerable burden on clients and services. This research evaluated a brief, low-cost self-regulation intervention (i.e., implementation intentions) designed to sustain attendance at a group psychoeducation program. Method: Clients (N = 82) who had been referred for a psychological intervention due to anxiety or depression were sent a questionnaire concerning their views of attendance. Participants were randomly assigned to form an implementation intention as part of the questionnaire or not (controls). Attendance was then monitored over the 5 scheduled sessions of an evidence-based psychoeducational intervention. Results: Intention-to-treat analyses indicated that forming implementation intentions led to attendance at a greater number of sessions (M = 2.84 vs. 1.62), p &lt; .01, and higher rates of completing the full course of treatment compared to controls (35% vs. 11%), p &lt; .02. Conclusions: An intervention rooted in basic research on the psychology of action increased and sustained attendance at a mental health service.",2153616205," Evidence Based Healthcare , Journal Article",2018
"Towards personalized, brain-based behavioral intervention for transdiagnostic anxiety: Transient neural responses to negative images predict outcomes following a targeted computer-based intervention.","Objective: Clinical anxiety is prevalent, highly comorbid with other conditions, and associated with significant medical morbidity, disability, and public health burden. Excessive attentional deployment toward threat is a transdiagnostic dimension of anxiety seen at both initial and sustained stages of threat processing. However, group-level observations of these phenomena mask considerable within-group heterogeneity that has been linked to treatment outcomes, suggesting that a transdiagnostic, individual differences approach may capture critical, clinically relevant information. Method: Seventy clinically anxious individuals were randomized to receive 8 sessions of attention bias modification (ABM; n = 41 included in analysis), a computer-based mechanistic intervention that specifically targets initial stages of threat processing, or a sham control (n = 21). Participants completed a mixed block/event-related functional MRI task optimized to discriminate transient from sustained neural responses to threat. Results: Larger transient responses across a wide range of cognitive-affective regions (e.g., ventrolateral prefrontal cortex, anterior cingulate cortex, amygdala) predicted better clinical outcomes following ABM, in both a priori anatomical regions and whole-brain analyses; sustained responses did not. A spatial pattern recognition algorithm using transient threat responses successfully discriminated the top quartile of ABM responders with 68% accuracy. Conclusions: Neural alterations occurring on the relatively transient timescale that is specifically targeted by ABM predict favorable clinical outcomes. Results inform how to expand on the initial promise of neurocognitive treatments like ABM by fine-tuning their clinical indications (e.g., through personalized mechanistic intervention relevant across diagnoses) and by increasing the range of mechanisms that can be targeted (e.g., through synergistic treatment combinations and/or novel neurocognitive training protocols designed to tackle identified predictors of nonresponse).",2153615986, Journal Article,2018
Anxiety Sensitivity and Suicidal Ideation/Suicide Risk: A Meta-Analysis,"Objective: Suicide is a global public health concern. To inform the prevention and treatment of suicidality, it is crucial to identify transdiagnostic vulnerability factors for suicide and suicide-related conditions. One candidate factor is anxiety sensitivity (AS)-the fear of anxiety-related sensations-which has been implicated in the pathogenesis of a host of mental health outcomes, including suicidal thoughts and behaviors. Importantly, AS is distinct from trait anxiety and negative affectivity, highlighting its potential incremental utility in the understanding of psychopathology. Despite a burgeoning body of literature demonstrating that AS is linked to suicidal thoughts and behaviors, this research has yet to be synthesized. Method: This meta-analysis includes 33 articles representing 34 nonredundant samples (N = 14,002) that examined at least one relationship between AS global or subfactor (i.e., cognitive, physical, social) scores and suicidal ideation and/or suicide risk. Results: Findings revealed small-to-moderate and moderate associations between global AS and suicidal ideation (r = .24, 95% confidence interval (CI): [.21, .26], p &lt; .001) and suicide risk (r = .35, 95% CI [.31, .38], p &lt; .001), respectively. All AS subfactors evinced significant associations with suicidal ideation (rs = .13–.24) and suicide risk (rs = .22–.32). Conclusions: AS is related to suicidal ideation and global suicide risk. Research is needed to disentangle AS from other indices of distress in the prediction of suicidal thoughts and behaviors. Theoretical and clinical implications of these findings are discussed.",2125723941," Evidence Based Healthcare , Journal Article",2018
Does Centrality in a Cross-Sectional Network Suggest Intervention Targets for Social Anxiety Disorder?,"Objective: Network analysis allows us to identify the most interconnected (i.e., central) symptoms, and multiple authors have suggested that these symptoms might be important treatment targets. This is because change in central symptoms (relative to others) should have greater impact on change in all other symptoms. It has been argued that networks derived from cross-sectional data may help identify such important symptoms. We tested this hypothesis in social anxiety disorder. Method: We first estimated a state-of-the-art regularized partial correlation network based on participants with social anxiety disorder (n = 910) to determine which symptoms were more central. Next, we tested whether change in these central symptoms were indeed more related to overall symptom change in a separate dataset of participants with social anxiety disorder who underwent a variety of treatments (n = 244). We also tested whether relatively superficial item properties (infrequency of endorsement and variance of items) might account for any effects shown for central symptoms. Results: Centrality indices successfully predicted how strongly changes in items correlated with change in the remainder of the items. Findings were limited to the measure used in the network and did not generalize to three other measures related to social anxiety severity. In contrast, infrequency of endorsement showed associations across all measures. Conclusions: The transfer of recently published results from cross-sectional network analyses to treatment data is unlikely to be straightforward.",2125760105, Journal Article,2018
Cognitive–behavioral therapy for youth anxiety: An effectiveness evaluation in community practice,"Objective: To compare the effectiveness of individual cognitive–behavioral therapy (ICBT) and group CBT (GCBT) for referred children with anxiety disorders within community mental health clinics. Method: Children (N = 165; ages 7–13 years) referred to 5 clinics in Norway because of primary separation anxiety disorder (SAD), social anxiety disorder (SOC), or generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) based on Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (4th ed., text rev.) criteria participated in a randomized clinical trial. Participants were randomized to ICBT, GCBT, or wait list (WL). WL participants were randomized to 1 of the 2 active treatment conditions following the wait period. Primary outcome was loss of principal anxiety disorder over 12 weeks and 2-year follow-up. Results: Both ICBT and GCBT were superior to WL on all outcomes. In the intent-to-treat analysis, 52% in ICBT, 65% in GCBT, and 14% in WL were treatment responders. Planned pairwise comparisons found no significant differences between ICBT and GCBT. GCBT was superior to ICBT for children diagnosed with SOC. Improvement continued during 2-year follow-up with no significant between-groups differences. Conclusions: Among anxiety disordered children, both individual and group CBT can be effectively delivered in community clinics. Response rates were similar to those reported in efficacy trials. Although GCBT was more effective than ICBT for children with SOC following treatment, both treatments were comparable at 2-year follow-up. Dropout rates were lower in GCBT than in ICBT, suggesting that GCBT may be better tolerated. Response rates continued to improve over the follow-up period, with low rates of relapse.",2112643118, Journal Article,2018
Results from the Child/Adolescent Anxiety Multimodal Longitudinal Study (CAMELS): Functional outcomes,"Objective: To report functional outcomes from the multisite Child/Adolescent Anxiety Multimodal Extended Long-term Study (CAMELS), which examined the impact of youth anxiety treatment (cognitive-behavioral therapy [CBT], coping cat; Sertraline, SRT; COMB [CBT + SRT]; pill placebo) on (a) global and (b) domain-specific functioning assessed an average of 3.1 times, 3- to 12-years postrandomization (first assessment = mean 6.5 years postrandomization). Method: Three-hundred and 19 of 488 families from the Child/Adolescent Anxiety Multimodal Study (CAMS; Walkup et al., 2008) participated. Growth curve modeling examined the impact of treatment condition and acute treatment outcomes (i.e., response, remission) on global functioning, global and domain-specific impairment, and life satisfaction across follow-up visits. Logistic regressions explored the impact of treatment remission and condition on low frequency events (arrests/convictions) and education. Results: Treatment responders and remitters demonstrated better global functioning, decreased overall impairment, and increased life satisfaction at follow-up. Treatment remission, but not response, predicted decreased domain-specific impairment (social relationships, self-care/independence, academic functioning), and maintenance of increased life satisfaction across follow-ups. Participants in the CBT condition, compared with pill placebo, demonstrated improved trajectories pertaining to life satisfaction, overall impairment, and impairment in academic functioning. Randomization to CBT or COMB treatment was associated with increasing employment rates. Trajectories for participants randomized to SRT was not significantly different from placebo. Treatment outcome and condition did not predict legal outcomes, school/work variables, or family life. Conclusion: Positive early intervention outcomes are associated with improved overall functioning, life satisfaction, and functioning within specific domains 6.5 years posttreatment. Treatment type differentially predicted trajectories of functioning. Findings support the positive impact of pediatric anxiety treatment into adolescence and early adulthood.",2112642297, Journal Article,2018
"When the torch is passed, does the flame still burn? Testing a “train the supervisor” model for the Child STEPs treatment program","Objective: We assessed sustainability of an empirically supported, transdiagnostic youth psychotherapy program when therapist supervision was shifted from external experts to internal clinic staff. Method: One hundred sixty-eight youths, aged 6–15 years, 59.5% male, 85.1% Caucasian, were treated for anxiety, depression, traumatic stress, or conduct problems by clinicians employed in community mental health clinics. In Phase 1 (2.7 years), 1 group of clinicians, the Sustain group, received training in Child STEPs (a modular transdiagnostic treatment + weekly feedback on youth response) and treated clinic-referred youths, guided by weekly supervision from external STEPs experts. In Phase 2 (2.9 years), Sustain clinicians treated additional youths but with supervision by clinic staff who had been trained to supervise STEPs. Also in Phase 2, a new group, External Supervision clinicians, received training and supervision from external STEPs experts and treated referred youths. Phase 2 youths were randomized to Sustain or External Supervision clinicians. Groups were compared on 3 therapist fidelity measures and 14 clinical outcome measures. Results: Sustain clinicians maintained their previous levels of fidelity and youth outcomes after switching from external to internal supervision; and in Phase 2, the Sustain and External Supervision groups also did not differ on fidelity or youth outcomes. Whereas all 34 group comparisons were nonsignificant, trends with the largest effect sizes showed better clinical outcomes for internal than external supervision. Conclusions: Implementation of empirically supported transdiagnostic treatment may be sustained when supervision is transferred from external experts to trained clinic staff, potentially enhancing cost-effectiveness and staying power in clinical practice.",2112642291, Journal Article,2018
More than my RA: A randomized trial investigating body image improvement among women with rheumatoid arthritis using a functionality-focused intervention program,"Objective: Negative body image is prevalent in women with rheumatoid arthritis and can affect other areas of well-being. Patients have expressed desire for body image to be addressed in treatment. Yet, it is not routinely addressed and no experimental intervention research has been conducted, until now. This randomized trial evaluated a brief online body image intervention for women with rheumatoid arthritis, with a focus on body functionality (everything the body is capable of doing) as the primary technique. Method: Women with rheumatoid arthritis and who wanted to feel better about their body (N = 84; Mage = 44.82) were randomized to the Expand Your Horizon intervention (comprising 3 writing exercises focusing on body functionality) or a waitlist control group. Primary outcomes concerned body image and secondary outcomes related to rheumatoid arthritis; these outcomes were assessed at pretest, posttest, and at 1-week and 1-month follow-up. Results: Multilevel modeling analyses showed that, relative to control, participants in the intervention experienced improvements in various aspects of body image (functionality appreciation, body appreciation, body satisfaction, body–self alienation) and decreases in depression, with effects persisting at 1-week and 1-month follow-up. No intervention effects were found for body–self harmony, rheumatoid arthritis-specific disability, pain-related disability, and anxiety. Conclusions: Focusing on body functionality can improve body image and reduce depression in women with rheumatoid arthritis. The intervention technique is easy and affordable to deliver and could be a fruitful addition to extant treatments for rheumatoid arthritis.",2103705589," Evidence Based Healthcare , Journal Article",2018
Brief Mindfulness Training for Negative Affectivity: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis,"Objective: Over the last 10 years, there has been a dramatic increase in published randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of brief mindfulness training (from single-session inductions to multisession interventions lasting up to 2 weeks), with some preliminary indications that these training programs may improve mental health outcomes, such as negative affectivity. This meta-analysis aimed to evaluate whether brief mindfulness training reliably reduces negative affectivity. Method: PubMed, PsycINFO, and the Mindfulness Research Monthly Newsletter were systematically searched for brief mindfulness intervention RCTs assessing negative affectivity outcomes (e.g., depression, rumination, anxiety, stress). Sixty-five RCTs, including 5,489 participants predominantly without experience in meditation (64.64% female, mean age = 24.62), qualified for the meta-analytic review. Results: The meta-analysis revealed a small but significant effect of brief mindfulness training on reducing negative affectivity compared to control programs (g = .21, p &lt; .001). The overall effect size was significantly moderated by participant characteristics: community samples (g = .41, p &lt; .001) produced larger training effects compared to student samples (g = .14, p = .001; Q between p = .03). No significant effect size differences were found between clinical and nonclinical samples. However, when accounting for publication bias, the overall effect size of brief mindfulness training programs on negative affectivity was significantly reduced (g = .04). Conclusions: Brief mindfulness training programs are increasingly popular approaches for reducing negative affectivity. This meta-analysis indicates that brief mindfulness training modestly reduces negative affectivity. Quantitative analyses indicated the presence of publication bias (i.e., unpublished null effect studies), highlighting the need to continue rigorous evaluation of brief mindfulness interventions.",2103699198," Evidence Based Healthcare , Journal Article",2018
Exposure and CBT for chronic back pain: An RCT on differential efficacy and optimal length of treatment,"Objective: Our aim was to establish whether Exposure, a specialized tailored treatment for chronic low back pain, has any advantages over cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) among individuals with high fear-avoidance levels. Second, we planned to compare short and long versions of Exposure. Third, we aimed to investigate whether Exposure can be delivered in an outpatient psychological setting. Method: A total of 88 Caucasian participants (55% women) were randomized to three different psychological treatment conditions, Exposure-long, Exposure-short, and CBT. All participants were suffering from chronic pain and elevated levels of pain-related anxiety and disability. The primary outcomes were disability (assessed using two different questionnaires, QBPDS and PDI) and average pain intensity; secondary outcomes included pain-related anxiety, psychological flexibility, coping strategies, and depression. Assessments took place at pretreatment, midtreatment, posttreatment, and 6-month follow-up. Results: Exposure was more effective than CBT at reducing movement-related disability assessed with the QBPDS. Exposure and CBT did not differ in reduction of pain intensity or disability assessed using the PDI. Exposure-short outperformed Exposure-long after 10 sessions, meaning that individuals improved faster when they were offered fewer sessions. Exposure could be safely delivered in the psychological setting. Concerning secondary outcomes, Exposure led to greater improvements in psychological flexibility relative to CBT. CBT was more effective than Exposure at enhancing coping strategies. In Exposure, significantly more participants dropped out. Conclusions: Although being more challenging to patients, Exposure is an effective treatment, which can be delivered in a psychological treatment setting and should be offered as a short-term treatment.",2103707803, Journal Article,2018
Treatment of social approach processes in adults with social anxiety disorder,"Objective: Despite the social impairment associated with social anxiety disorder (SAD), little research has examined the impact of treatment on positive relational functioning. Accordingly, the authors conducted a treatment outcome study to evaluate a cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) regimen augmented by a relational focus (CBT-R) relative to a graduated exposure-applied relaxation (GEAR) regimen and wait list (WL) control. To examine the mechanism(s) that underlies treatment effects, they used structural equation modeling (SEM) to evaluate two potential mediators, change in judgment biases and in safety behaviors. Method: Treatment-seeking adults who met SAD diagnostic criteria (n = 100; 50% women; mean age = 32.9 years.; 36% ethnic minority) were randomly assigned to CBT-R, GEAR, or WL. CBT-R and GEAR participants received 14 group treatment sessions. Social initiation, relationship satisfaction, and a SAD symptom composite were assessed at pre- and postassessment, and 6- and 12-month follow-ups. Results: Intent-to-treat multilevel modeling analyses indicated that the CBT-R regimen resulted in significantly greater improvement relative to GEAR on relationship satisfaction and SAD symptoms. SEM results revealed that change in safety behaviors partially mediated the superior performance of CBT-R on both variables with confidence intervals set at .90. Conclusions: These findings indicate that CBT-based regimens can improve social approach processes in individuals with SAD and that safety behavior reduction contributes to positive outcomes.",2103706613, Journal Article,2018
A mobile app for social anxiety disorder: A three-arm randomized controlled trial comparing mobile and PC-based guided self-help interventions,"Objective: Internet-based cognitive–behavioral treatments (ICBT) have shown promise for various mental disorders, including social anxiety disorder (SAD). Most of these treatments have been delivered on desktop computers. However, the use of smartphones is becoming ubiquitous and could extend the reach of ICBT into users’ everyday life. Only a few studies have empirically examined the efficacy of ICBT delivered through a smartphone app and there is no published study on mobile app delivered ICBT for SAD. This three-arm randomized-controlled trial (RCT) is the first to compare the efficacy of guided ICBT for smartphones (app) and conventional computers (PC) with a wait list control group (WL). Method: A total of 150 individuals meeting the diagnostic criteria for SAD were randomly assigned to one of the three conditions. Primary endpoints were self-report measures and diagnostic status of SAD. Results: After 12 weeks of treatment, both active conditions showed superior outcome on the composite of all SAD measures (PC vs. WL: d = 0.74; App vs. WL: d = 0.89) and promising diagnostic response rates (NNTPC = 3.33; NNTApp = 6.00) compared to the WL. No significant between-groups effects were found between the two active conditions on the composite score (Cohen’s d = 0.07). Treatment gains were maintained at 3-month follow-up. Program use was more evenly spread throughout the day in the mobile condition, indicating an integration of the program into daily routines. Conclusions: ICBT can be delivered effectively using smartphones.",2103704756," Evidence Based Healthcare , Journal Article",2018
Effects of anxiety sensitivity reduction on smoking abstinence: An analysis from a panic prevention program,"Objective: Scientific evidence implicates anxiety sensitivity (AS) as a risk factor for poor smoking cessation outcomes. Integrated smoking cessation programs that target AS may lead to improved smoking cessation outcomes, potentially through AS reduction. Yet, little work has evaluated the efficacy of integrated smoking cessation treatment on smoking abstinence. The present study prospectively examined treatment effects of a novel AS reduction-smoking cessation intervention relative to a standard smoking cessation intervention on smoking abstinence. Method: Participants (N = 529; 45.9% male; Mage = 38.23, SD = 13.56) included treatment-seeking smokers who received either a 4-session integrated anxiety-reduction and smoking cessation intervention (Smoking Treatment and Anxiety Management Program; [STAMP]) or a 4-session standard smoking cessation program (SCP). The primary aims focused on examining the effects of STAMP on (a) AS reduction during treatment, (b) early and late smoking point prevalence abstinence, and (c) the mechanistic function of AS reduction on treatment effects across early and late smoking abstinence. Results: Results indicated a significantly greater decline in AS in STAMP relative to SCP (B = −.72, p &lt; .001). Treatment condition did not significantly directly predict early or late abstinence. However, the effect of STAMP on early abstinence was significantly mediated by reductions in AS (indirect = .16, 95% CI [.02, .40]). Conclusions: Findings provide evidence for the efficacy of a novel, integrated anxiety and smoking cessation treatment to reduce AS. Moreover, the meditation pathway from STAMP to early abstinence through reductions in AS suggest that AS is a clinically important mechanism of change for smoking cessation treatment and research.",2103705331, Journal Article,2018
Congruence of Therapeutic Bond Perceptions and Its Relation to Treatment Outcome: Within- and Between-Dyad Effects,"Objective: The present study investigates the association between congruence of patients’ and therapists’ perceptions of the therapeutic bond and symptom improvement. Method: Bond congruence-outcome associations were examined on the within- and between-dyad level for 580 patients (mainly depression and anxiety) receiving cognitive–behavioral therapy. Symptom change was assessed on a session-to-session level as well as from pre- to posttreatment. For the between-dyad analyses, the truth and bias model was applied. For the within-dyad analyses, polynomial regression and response surface analysis were conducted. Results: On the between-dyad level, higher temporal congruence between patients’ and therapists’ bond ratings (i.e., their correlation) was associated with better treatment outcomes. Additionally, the average discrepancy between therapists’ and patients’ bond ratings showed a significant quadratic association with treatment outcome. A tendency for therapists to moderately rate the bond lower than their patients’ showed lowest posttreatment symptom scores. On the within-dyad level, we found that when patients’ and therapists’ ratings were in “agreement,” higher bond scores were associated with fewer next-session symptoms. For “disagreement,” the results showed that if therapists rated the bond as weak, whereas their patients rated it as strong, higher subsequent symptom distress was observed than if patients rated the bond as weak and their therapists rated it as strong. Conclusions: The present study highlights the importance of therapists being vigilant to session-to-session changes in the therapeutic bond to adjust their interventions accordingly.",2104952393, Journal Article,2018
A randomized controlled trial of emotion regulation therapy for generalized anxiety disorder with and without co-occurring depression,"Objective: Generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) and major depression (MDD), especially when they co-occur, are associated with suboptimal treatment response. One common feature of these disorders is negative self-referential processing (NSRP; i.e., worry, rumination), which worsens treatment outcome. Emotion Regulation Therapy (ERT) integrates principles from affect science with traditional and contemporary cognitive-behavioral treatments to identify and modify the functional nature of NSRP by targeting motivational and regulatory mechanisms, as well as behavioral consequences. Method: Building on encouraging open trial findings, 53 patients with a primary diagnosis of GAD (43% with comorbid MDD) were randomly assigned to immediate treatment with ERT (n = 28) or a modified attention control condition (MAC, n = 25). Results: ERT patients, as compared with MAC patients, evidenced statistically and clinically meaningful improvement on clinical indicators of GAD and MDD, worry, rumination, comorbid disorder severity, functional impairment, quality of life, as well as hypothesized mechanisms reflecting mindful attentional, metacognitive, and overall emotion regulation, which all demonstrated mediation of primary outcomes. This superiority of ERT exceeded medium effect sizes with most outcomes surpassing conventions for a large effect. Treatment effects were maintained for nine months following the end of acute treatment. Overall, ERT resulted in high rates of high endstate functioning for both GAD and MDD that were maintained into the follow-up period. Conclusions: Findings provide encouraging support for the efficacy and hypothesized mechanisms underlying ERT and point to fruitful directions for improving our understanding and treatment of complex clinical conditions such as GAD with co-occurring MDD.",2023709294," Evidence Based Healthcare , Journal Article",2018
How does exposure therapy work? A comparison between generic and gastrointestinal anxiety–specific mediators in a dismantling study of exposure therapy for irritable bowel syndrome,"Objective: Systematic exposure is potentially an effective treatment procedure for treating irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), but little is known about the processes by which it achieves its effect on outcome. The aim of this study was to identify mediators in a previously published randomized dismantling trial in which participants with IBS were randomized to Internet-delivered cognitive-behavioral treatment (ICBT) that incorporated systematic exposure or to the same treatment protocol without exposure (ICBT-WE). Method: Weekly measurements of gastrointestinal anxiety--specific process variables (behavioral avoidance, gastrointestinal-specific anxiety) based on the gastrointestinal symptom--specific anxiety model, generic process variables (self-efficacy and mindful nonreactivity), and treatment outcome (IBS symptoms) were obtained from 309 participants with IBS. Growth models and cross-lagged panel models, estimated within structural equation modeling, were employed to evaluate mediators of outcome. Results: Parallel process growth modeling showed that behavioral avoidance, gastrointestinal-specific anxiety, self-efficacy mediated the incremental effect of ICBT compared to ICBT-WE. The mediated effect of avoidance was stronger for individuals scoring high on the avoidance variable at 1st measurement point. Cross-lagged regression analyses with random effects revealed that behavioral avoidance and gastrointestinal-specific anxiety had a stronger effect on subsequent symptom change rather than vice versa, whereas mindful nonreactivity and self-efficacy displayed the opposite pattern. Conclusions: The evidence collectively provided support for the hypothesis that exposure for IBS achieves its positive results by virtue of changing gastrointestinal anxiety-specific processes rather than generic processes. IBS-specific behavioral avoidance emerged as the most clear-cut mediator of the specific effect of exposure on outcome.",2023708572, Journal Article,2018
Training clinicians to deliver group CBT to manage anxiety in youth with ASD: Results of a multisite trial,"Objective: Few guidelines are available regarding optimal training models for practitioners delivering cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) for anxiety in youth with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). The present study systematically compared 3 instructional conditions for delivering the Facing Your Fears program (FYF) to children with ASD and anxiety. Method: Thirty-four clinicians (Mage = 34 years; 94% women, 88% Caucasian) and an intent-to-treat sample of 91 children with ASD and anxiety (Mage = 11; 84% male 53% Caucasian) met eligibility criteria across 4 sites. A 3-group parallel design via a Latin square procedure was used to randomize 9 teams of clinicians to 1 of 3 training conditions: Manual, Workshop, Workshop-Plus. The effectiveness of instructional condition was assessed via implementation (CBT knowledge, treatment fidelity) and treatment outcomes (reductions in anxiety as measured by the Anxiety Disorders Interview Schedule-Parent (ADIS-P). Results: Clinicians in both Workshop conditions significantly increased CBT knowledge postworkshop, F(1, 18) = 19.8, p &lt; .001. Excellent treatment fidelity was obtained across conditions (above 89%), although clinicians in the Workshop conditions obtained significantly higher fidelity ratings and delivered FYF with greater quality than the Manual condition. Children with ASD demonstrated significant reductions in anxiety symptoms for three of the four anxiety diagnoses, with no differences noted across instructional condition. Rates of improvement were lower than those obtained in a previous controlled trial. Conclusions: Results suggest that although there may be some advantage to participating in a Workshop, clinicians in all conditions could deliver FYF with excellent fidelity and yield positive treatment outcomes. Lack of a no-treatment comparison group limits interpretation of findings.",2023707491, Journal Article,2018
Compassion-focused therapy as guided self-help for enhancing public mental health: A randomized controlled trial,"Objective: Despite promising results for compassion-focused therapy (CFT) as self-help, larger-scale trials including long-term follow-up data are needed to establish its effectiveness in the context of public mental health. Empirical evidence supporting its effectiveness in improving well-being is lacking. In a randomized controlled trial, the effects of CFT as guided self-help on well-being were evaluated. Method: Adults (mean age = 52.87, SD = 9.99, 74.8% female) with low to moderate levels of well-being were recruited in the Dutch population and randomized to CFT (n = 120) or a waitlist control group (n = 122). Participants completed the Mental Health Continuum-Short Form (well-being), Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (depression and anxiety), Perceived Stress Scale (stress), Self-Compassion Scale-Short Form (self-compassion), Forms of Self-Criticizing/Attacking and Reassurance Scale (self-criticism and self-reassurance), Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (positive/negative affect), and Gratitude questionnaire (gratitude) at baseline, postintervention (3 months), 3- and 9-month follow-up. Results: Compared with the waitlist control group, the CFT group showed superior improvement on well-being at postintervention, d = .51, 95% CI [.25, .77], p &lt; .001, and 3-month follow-up, d = .39, 95% CI [.13, .65], p &lt; .001. No significant moderators were found. On all secondary outcome measures but positive affect, the intervention group showed significantly greater improvements up to 3-month follow-up. At 9-month follow-up, improvements on all measures were retained or amplified among CFT participants. Conclusions: CFT as guided self-help shows promise as a public mental health strategy for enhancing well-being and reducing psychological distress.",2007670724," Evidence Based Healthcare , Journal Article",2018
Follow-up of monotherapy remitters in the PReDICT study: Maintenance treatment outcomes and clinical predictors of recurrence,"Objective: This study followed remitted patients from a randomized controlled trial of adults with major depressive disorder (MDD). The aims were to describe rates of recurrence and to evaluate 3 clinical predictor domains. Method: Ninety-four treatment-naive patients (50% female; Mage = 38.1 years; 48.9% White; 30.9% Hispanic) with MDD who had remitted to 12-week monotherapy (escitalopram, duloxetine, or cognitive behavior therapy [CBT]) participated in a 21-month maintenance phase (i.e., continued medication or 3 possible CBT booster sessions per year). Recurrence was assessed quarterly, and the clinical predictors were the following: 2 measures of residual depressive symptoms, 1 measure of lifetime depressive episodes, and 2 measures of baseline anxiety. Survival analysis models evaluated recurrence rates, and regression models evaluated the predictors. Results: Among all patients, 15.5% experienced a recurrence, and the survival distributions did not statistically differ among treatments. Residual depressive symptoms on the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale at the end of monotherapy were associated with increased risk for recurrence (hazard ratio = 1.31, 95% confidence interval [CI: 1.02, 1.67], Wald X2 = 4.41, p = .036), and not having a comorbid anxiety disorder diagnosis at study baseline reduced the risk of recurrence (hazard ratio = .31, 95% CI [.10, .94], Wald X2 = 4.28, p = .039). Conclusions: The study supported the benefits of maintenance treatment for treatment-naive patients who remitted to initial monotherapy; nevertheless, remitted patients with a comorbid anxiety disorder diagnosis at the beginning of treatment or residual depressive symptoms after initial treatment were at risk for poorer long-term outcomes.",2007670589, Journal Article,2018
Randomized Clinical Trial Evaluating the Preliminary Effectiveness of an Integrated Anxiety Disorder Treatment in Substance Use Disorder Specialty Clinics,"Objective: Anxiety and substance use disorders are highly comorbid and mutually maintain each other. Treatments for anxiety disorders that are well integrated into substance use disorder treatment have the potential to improve both anxiety and substance use outcomes. Method: Ninety-seven individuals seeking treatment at a community-based, evidence-based intensive outpatient program for substance use disorders who also had anxiety disorders were randomized to either (a) usual care (UC) at the intensive outpatient program; or (b) UC + coordinated anxiety learning and management for addiction recovery centers (CALM ARC), a 7-session, group-based, computer-assisted but therapist-directed treatment for anxiety disorders adapted for individuals with anxiety disorder and substance use disorder comorbidity. Results: CALM ARC + UC outperformed UC on measures of anxiety and substance use at posttreatment and at a 6-month follow-up. Conclusions: Adding CALM ARC to UC for patients with comorbid anxiety disorders and substance use disorders is superior to UC alone. Implications for future research and clinical practice are discussed.",1992643718," Evidence Based Healthcare , Journal Article",2018
Internet-Based Cognitive Behavioral Therapy Versus Psychoeducation Control for Illness Anxiety Disorder and Somatic Symptom Disorder: A Randomized Controlled Trial,"Objective: To examine the efficacy of an Internet-delivered cognitive-behavioral therapy (iCBT) program for health anxiety compared to an active psychoeducation control group. Method: Individuals (N = 86, mean age: 30 years, 87% female) with a Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (5th ed.) diagnosis of illness anxiety disorder or somatic symptom disorder with health anxiety were randomized to either a 6-lesson clinician-guided iCBT program for health anxiety (n = 45) or an active control group who received anxiety psychoeducation, clinical support, and monitoring (control, n = 41) over a 12-week period. Results: Both groups experienced significant improvements between baseline and posttreatment on self-report measures of health anxiety, depression, general anxiety, and functional impairment. Intention-to-treat analyses indicated that the iCBT group experienced greater improvements in health anxiety on the Short Health Anxiety Inventory (SHAI) compared to controls (between-groups effect size = 1.39, 95% confidence interval [0.87, 1.93]), and a greater proportion of the iCBT group showed clinically reliable change on the SHAI (84% vs. 34% in the control group). Similarly, the iCBT group outperformed the control group on secondary measures of depression, generalized anxiety, functional impairment, maladaptive cognitions, body hypervigilance, safety behaviors and avoidance, and intolerance of uncertainty. Gains were maintained at 3-month follow-up in the iCBT group. Conclusion: iCBT for health anxiety is more effective than psychoeducation, clinical support, and monitoring, and presents an efficacious and accessible treatment option for people with health anxiety.",1992640474," Evidence Based Healthcare , Journal Article",2018
The Mediating Effect of Family Cohesion in Reducing Patient Symptoms and Family Distress in a Culturally Informed Family Therapy for Schizophrenia: A Parallel-Process Latent-Growth Model,"Objective: Although both patients with schizophrenia and their caregivers report elevated levels of depression, anxiety, and stress (DASS), affective symptoms in patients and family members seldom constitute a primary treatment focus. The present study tested whether a culturally informed family therapy for schizophrenia (CIT-S) outperformed standard family psychoeducation (PSY-ED) not only in decreasing patient schizophrenia symptoms, but also in decreasing individual DASS. Because CIT-S fostered family cohesion throughout treatment, we predicted that increases in family cohesion would mediate treatment effects. Method: Participants included 266 patients and family members nested within 115 families, randomized to the CIT-S or PSY-ED conditions. We specified a series of multilevel latent growth and latent change models to examine direct effects of CIT-S on patient schizophrenia symptoms, individual DASS, and family cohesion over time. Next, we used parallel-process growth models to test the indirect effect of CIT-S on decreasing patient and caregiver psychopathology over time via changes in family cohesion. Results: The CIT-S treatment significantly reduced patient schizophrenia symptoms from baseline to follow-up (γ = -1.72, 95% confidence interval [CI] [-2.83, -0.60]), as well as individual DASS (γ = -4.39, 95% CI [-6.44, -2.34]) from baseline to termination. In line with treatment goals, CIT-S increased family cohesion from baseline to midpoint (γ = 0.93, 95% CI [0.06, 1.80]). The CIT-S-related change in cohesion mediated changes in DASS (γ = -0.87, 95% CI [-1.47, -0.27]), but not patient symptoms. Conclusion: By integrating the family's cultural context into treatment, clinicians may foster family dynamics that enhance treatment outcomes and promote broad improvements in mental health.",1992639863, Journal Article,2018
A Prospective Investigation of the Synergistic Effect of Change in Anxiety Sensitivity and Dysphoria on Tobacco Withdrawal,"Objective: Prevailing theory and research suggests the psychological and physiological discomfort associated with tobacco withdrawal may play a formative role in the risk of cessation failure. Yet, research elucidating cognitive-affective vulnerability characteristics that contribute to increased tobacco withdrawal severity during periods of planned abstinence is highly limited. In the current study, we explored whether smokers with greater reductions of Anxiety Sensitivity (AS) and dysphoria during a smoking cessation intervention would experience less severe postquit tobacco withdrawal. Method: Specifically, the interactive effect of change (from preintervention baseline to quit day) in AS and dysphoria in relation to postquit withdrawal severity (quit day through 12 weeks postquit) was examined among treatment-seeking adult smokers enrolled in a smoking cessation trial (N = 198; 55.3% female; 86.8% Caucasian; Mage = 38.8, SD = 14.0). Results: Results indicated that the interactive effect of change in AS and dysphoria was related to linear change in postquit withdrawal symptoms. Specifically, larger reductions in AS were associated with a faster decline in the severity of withdrawal symptoms across the 12-week postquit period only for individuals with lower (but not higher) reductions in dysphoria. Additionally, the findings indicated that reducing levels of AS and dysphoria prequit is broadly related to the degree of change in postquit withdrawal symptoms. Conclusion: Collectively, these data suggest there is apt to be clinical merit to employing strategies to address AS and/or dysphoria to more effectively manage emergent withdrawal symptoms following smoking cessation treatment.",1992639807, Journal Article,2018
Comparing treatment response between LGBQ and heterosexual individuals attending a CBT- and DBT-skills-based partial hospital,"Objective: Despite a greater need for mental health treatment in individuals identifying as lesbian, gay, bisexual, queer, and other sexual minority identities (LGBQ+), no prior study has examined mental health treatment outcomes for LGBQ+ populations receiving standard care. We compared individuals identifying as LGBQ+ or heterosexual on treatment outcomes following a partial hospital program based on cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) and dialectical behavior therapy (DBT). Method: A total of 441 participants (19% LGBQ+; mean age = 34.42 years; 56% female, 42% male, 2% nonbinary) attending a partial hospital program completed measures at admission and discharge as part of standard care. We compared LGBQ+ and heterosexual individuals on symptom outcomes (24-item Behavior and Symptom Identification Scale, 7-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale, 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire), program dropout due to inpatient hospitalization, clinical global improvement, and perceived quality of care, controlling for baseline characteristics using propensity score adjustment. Results: Controlling for baseline demographic and clinical variables and a 10% false discovery rate, LGBQ+ and heterosexual individuals did not differ on treatment outcomes. However, when examining sexual identity subgroups, bisexual individuals reported more self-injurious and suicidal thoughts and worse perceptions of care at posttreatment compared to all other sexual identities. Conclusions: Findings support the comparable effectiveness of CBT- and DBT-skills-based hospital treatment for LGBQ+ and heterosexual individuals overall but suggest specific treatment disparities for bisexual individuals. Future research is needed to establish the effectiveness of traditional evidence-based treatment in other settings and to determine whether LGBQ+ affirmative treatments for specific LGBQ+ subgroups are superior to traditional treatments.",1982175121, Journal Article,2017
Mechanisms underlying mindfulness-based addiction treatment versus cognitive behavioral therapy and usual care for smoking cessation,"Objective: To examine cognitive and affective mechanisms underlying mindfulness-based addiction treatment (MBAT) versus cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) and usual care (UC) for smoking cessation. Method: Participants in the parent study from which data were drawn (N = 412; 54.9% female; 48.2% African American, 41.5% non-Latino White, 5.4% Latino, 4.9% other; 57.6% annual income &lt;$30,000) were randomized to MBAT (n = 154), CBT (n = 155), or UC (n = 103). From quit date through 26 weeks postquit, participants completed measures of emotions, craving, dependence, withdrawal, self-efficacy, and attentional bias. Biochemically confirmed 7-day smoking abstinence was assessed at 4 and 26 weeks postquit. Although the parent study did not find a significant treatment effect on abstinence, mixed-effects regression models were conducted to examine treatment effects on hypothesized mechanisms, and indirect effects of treatments on abstinence were tested. Results: Participants receiving MBAT perceived greater volitional control over smoking and evidenced lower volatility of anger than participants in both other treatments. However, there were no other significant differences between MBAT and CBT. Compared with those receiving UC, MBAT participants reported lower anxiety, concentration difficulties, craving, and dependence, as well as higher self-efficacy for managing negative affect without smoking. Indirect effects of MBAT versus UC on abstinence occurred through each of these mechanisms. Conclusions: Whereas several differences emerged between MBAT and UC, MBAT and CBT had similar effects on several of the psychosocial mechanisms implicated in tobacco dependence. Results help to shed light on similarities and differences between mindfulness-based and other active smoking cessation treatments.",1980998489, Journal Article,2017
Baseline patterns of substance use disorder severity and depression and anxiety symptoms moderate the efficacy of mindfulness-based relapse prevention,"Objective: Few studies have evaluated moderators of mindfulness-based relapse prevention (MBRP) for substance use disorders (SUDs). We tested whether baseline patterns of scores for SUD symptom severity and depression and anxiety symptoms moderated the efficacy of MBRP. Method: We used a latent class moderation approach with data from a randomized trial of MBRP compared to cognitive-behavioral relapse prevention and treatment as usual (TAU; Bowen et al., 2014; N = 286, 71.8% male, 48.4% non-White, mean age = 38.44 years, SD = 10.92) and a randomized trial comparing MBRP to TAU (Bowen et al., 2009; N = 168, 63.7% male, 44.6% non-White, mean age = 40.45, SD = .28). Indicators for the latent class models were measures of SUD severity (Severity of Dependence Scale and Short Inventory of Problems), depression symptoms (Beck Depression Inventory), and anxiety symptoms (Beck Anxiety Inventory). Results: In both trials, 3 latent classes provided the best fit: a high-high class characterized by high SUD severity and depression and anxiety symptoms, a high-low class characterized by high SUD severity and low depression and anxiety symptoms, and a low-low class characterized by low SUD severity and depression and anxiety symptoms. In both trials, we found significant latent Class × Treatment interaction effects: There were significant and large effects of MBRP on substance use outcomes in the high-high and high-low classes, but no MBRP effect in the low-low class. Conclusion: MBRP may be an optimal treatment for preventing relapse among clients with severe levels of SUD symptoms and depression and anxiety symptoms, as well as clients with only severe SUD symptoms.",1980998005, Journal Article,2017
Markers for context-responsiveness: Client baseline interpersonal problems moderate the efficacy of two psychotherapies for generalized anxiety disorder,"Objective: To follow-up a randomized clinical trial that compared the acute and long-term efficacy of 15 sessions of cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) versus CBT integrated with motivational interviewing (MI) for severe generalized anxiety disorder (GAD; Westra, Constantino, &amp; Antony, 2016), we (a) characterized the sample's baseline interpersonal problems, and (b) analyzed the role of several theory-relevant problems as moderators of the comparative treatment effects on outcome. Method: We first compared clients' (N = 85) baseline interpersonal problems profile to a general clinical sample. We next conducted piecewise, 2-level growth models to analyze the interactive effects of treatment condition and the hypothesized interpersonal problem indices of nonassertiveness (ranging from low to high), exploitability (ranging from low to high on this specific combination of nonassertiveness and friendliness), and overall agency (ranging from more problems of being too submissive to more problems of being too domineering, including friendly or hostile variants) on acute and follow-up worry reduction. Finally, we conducted hierarchical generalized linear models to examine these interactive effects on the likelihood of achieving clinically meaningful worry reduction across follow-up. Results: As expected, the GAD clients evidenced more nonassertive and exploitable interpersonal problems than the general clinical sample. Also as predicted, clients with more problematic nonassertiveness and low overall agency in their relationships had greater follow-up worry reduction in MI-CBT versus CBT, including to a clinically significant degree for the agency by treatment interaction. Conclusions: GAD-specific interpersonal problems can serve as contextual markers for integrative treatment selection and planning.",1966364194, Journal Article,2017
"Evaluation of an open-access CBT-based Internet program for social anxiety: Patterns of use, retention, and outcomes","Objective: Internet-delivered cognitive-behavioral therapy (ICBT) has been established as both efficacious and effective in reducing symptoms of social anxiety. However, most research has been conducted in controlled settings, and little is known regarding the utility of such programs in an open-access format. The present study examined the use, adherence, and effectiveness of Joyable, an open-access, Internet-delivered, coach-supported CBT-based intervention for social anxiety. Method: Participants were 3,384 registered users (Mage [SD] = 29.82 [7.89]; 54% male) that created an account between 2014 and 2016. Characteristics of use, factors related to attrition and adherence, and within-group outcomes were examined. The primary outcome measure was the Social Phobia Inventory. Results: On average, participants remained in the program for 81.02 days (SD = 60.50), during which they completed 12.14 activities (SD = 11.09) and 1.53 exposures (SD = 3.18). About half (57%) had contact with a coach. Full adherence to the program was achieved by 16% of participants, a rate higher than previously published open-access studies of ICBT. Social anxiety symptoms were significantly reduced for participants that engaged in the program, with medium within-group effects from baseline through the cognitive restructuring module (d = 0.63-0.76) and large effects from baseline through the exposure module (d = 1.40-1.83). Response rates were high (72%). Exposures and coach contact were significant predictors of retention and outcome. Conclusions: This open-access online CBT-based program is effective in reducing social anxiety symptoms and has the potential to extend Internet-based mental health services to socially anxious individuals unwilling or unable to seek face-to-face evidence-based therapy.",1966364188, Journal Article,2017
"Mental disorders among undocumented Mexican immigrants in high-risk neighborhoods: Prevalence, comorbidity, and vulnerabilities","Objective: This study aimed to: (a) provide population-based estimates for the prevalence of mental disorders, including substance use, among undocumented Mexican immigrants; (b) assess for relevant comorbidities; and (c) identify sociodemographic, immigration and contextual vulnerabilities associated with meeting criteria for a disorder. Method: This cross-sectional study used Respondent Driven Sampling (RDS) to collect and analyze data from clinical interviews with 248 undocumented Mexican immigrants residing near the California-Mexico border. The M.I.N.I. Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview was used as the primary outcome of interest. For all analyses, inferential statistics accounted for design effects and sample weights to produce weighted estimates. Logistic regression was used in multivariate analyses. Results: Overall, 23% of participants met criteria for a disorder (95% CI = 17.1; 29.0). The most prevalent disorders were Major Depressive Disorder (14%, 95% CI = 10.2; 18.6), Panic Disorder (8%, 95% CI = 5.0; 11.9) and Generalized Anxiety Disorder (7%, 95% CI = 3.4; 9.8). Approximately 4% of participants met criteria for a substance use disorder (95% CI = 1.2; 6.1). After controlling for covariates, being 18 to 25 years and experiencing distress from postmigration living difficulties were significantly associated with meeting criteria for a disorder. Conclusion: Undocumented Mexican immigrants are an at-risk population for mental disorders, particularly depression and anxiety disorders. Given that distress from postmigration living difficulties is associated with meeting criteria for a disorder, revisiting policies and developing new alternatives to facilitate access and provision of context-sensitive mental health services for this population is necessary to protect the human rights of these immigrants and that of their U.S. families.",1966364181, Journal Article,2017
Cognitive therapy and exposure therapy for hypochondriasis (health anxiety): A 3-year naturalistic follow-up,"Objective: Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) has been shown to be effective in treating hypochondriasis. However, there are doubts regarding the long-term effectiveness of CBT for hypochondriasis, in particular for follow-up periods longer than 1 year. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the long-term effectiveness of cognitive therapy (CT) and exposure therapy (ET) for the treatment of hypochondriasis. Method: Seventy-five patients with a diagnosis of hypochondriasis who were previously treated with CT or ET were contacted 3 years after treatment. Fifty (67%) patients participated and were interviewed by an independent and blinded diagnostician using standardized interviews. Results: We found further improvements after therapy in primary outcome measures (d = .37), general functioning (d = .38), and reduced doctor visits (d = .30) during the naturalistic follow-up period. At the 3-year follow-up, 72% of the patients no longer fulfilled the diagnosis of hypochondriasis. Based on the main outcome measure, we found response rates of 76% and remission rates of 68%. At follow-up, only 4% of patients were taking antidepressant medication. Additional psychological treatment was utilized by 18% of the patients during the follow-up period (only 8% because of health anxiety). We found no overall differences between CT and ET. Only a trend for a greater deterioration rate in CT (13%) in comparison to ET (0%) was found. Conclusions: Our results suggest that 2/3 of the patients with hypochondriasis were remitted in the long term. Thus, remission rates after CBT were twice as high as in untreated samples.",1966363444, Journal Article,2017
Case complexity as a guide for psychological treatment selection,"Objective: Some cases are thought to be more complex and difficult to treat, although there is little consensus on how to define complexity in psychological care. This study proposes an actuarial, data-driven method of identifying complex cases based on their individual characteristics. Method: Clinical records for 1,512 patients accessing low- and high-intensity psychological treatments were partitioned in 2 random subsamples. Prognostic indices predicting post-treatment reliable and clinically significant improvement (RCSI) in depression (Patient Health Questionnaire-9; Kroenke, Spitzer, &amp; Williams, 2001) and anxiety (Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7; Spitzer, Kroenke, Williams, &amp; Lowe, 2006) symptoms were estimated in 1 subsample using penalized (Lasso) regressions with optimal scaling. A PI-based algorithm was used to classify patients as standard (St) or complex (Cx) cases in the second (cross-validation) subsample. RCSI rates were compared between Cx cases that accessed treatments of different intensities using logistic regression. Results: St cases had significantly higher RCSI rates compared to Cx cases (OR = 1.81 to 2.81). Cx cases tended to attain better depression outcomes if they were initially assigned to high-intensity (vs. low intensity) interventions (OR = 2.23); a similar pattern was observed for anxiety but the odds ratio (1.74) was not statistically significant. Conclusions: Complex cases could be detected early and matched to high-intensity interventions to improve outcomes.",1939856453, Journal Article,2017
"Effectiveness of cognitive-behavioral therapy on quality of life, anxiety, and depressive symptoms among patients with inflammatory bowel disease: A multicenter randomized controlled trial","Objective: Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is characterized by a low level of quality of life (QoL) and a high prevalence of anxiety and depression, especially in patients with poor QoL. We examined the effect of IBD-specific cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) on QoL, anxiety, and depression in IBD patients with poor mental QoL. Method: This study is a parallel-group multicenter randomized controlled trial. One hundred eighteen IBD patients with a low level of QoL (score ≤23 on the mental health subscale of the Medical Outcomes Study Short Form 36 Health Survey [SF-36]) were included from 2 academic medical centers (Academic Medical Center Amsterdam, VU University Medical Centre Amsterdam) and 2 peripheral medical centers (Flevo Hospital, Slotervaart Hospital) in the Netherlands. Patients were randomized to an experimental group receiving CBT (n = 59) versus a wait-list control group (n = 59) receiving standard medical care for 3.5 months, followed by CBT. Both groups completed baseline and 3.5 months follow-up assessments. The primary outcome was a self-report questionnaire and disease-specific QoL (Inflammatory Bowel Disease Questionnaire [IBDQ]). Secondary outcomes were depression (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale-Depression Subscale [HADS-D], Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale [CES-D]), anxiety (HADS-Anxiety Subscale [HADS-A]) and generic QoL (SF-36). Results: Data were analyzed both on intention to treat as well as on per protocol analysis (completed ≥5 sessions). CBT had a positive effect on disease-specific-QoL (Cohen's d = .64 for IBDQ total score), depression (Cohen's d = .48 for HADS-D and .78 for CES-D), anxiety (Cohen's d = .58 for HADS-A), and generic QoL (Cohen's d = 1.08 for Mental Component Summary of the SF-36; all ps &lt; .01). Conclusions: IBD-specific CBT is effective in improving QoL and in decreasing anxiety and depression in IBD patients with poor QoL. Clinicians should incorporate screening on poor mental QoL and consider offering CBT.",1939840096," Evidence Based Healthcare , Journal Article",2017
"""Psychiatric disorders in smokers seeking treatment for tobacco dependence: Relations with tobacco dependence and cessation"": Correction to Piper et al. (2010)","Objective: The present research examined the relation of psychiatric disorders to tobacco dependence and cessation outcomes. Method: Data were collected from 1,504 smokers (58.2% women; 83.9% White; mean age = 44.67 years, SD = 11.08) making an aided smoking cessation attempt as part of a clinical trial. Psychiatric diagnoses were determined with the Composite International Diagnostic Interview structured clinical interview. Tobacco dependence was assessed with the Fagerstrom Test of Nicotine Dependence (FTND) and the Wisconsin Inventory of Smoking Dependence Motives (WISDM). Results: Diagnostic groups included those who were never diagnosed, those who had ever been diagnosed (at any time, including in the past year), and those with past-year diagnoses (with or without prior diagnosis). Some diagnostic groups had lower follow-up abstinence rates than did the never diagnosed group (ps &lt; .05). At 8 weeks after quitting, strong associations were found between cessation outcome and both past-year mood disorder and ever diagnosed anxiety disorder. At 6 months after quitting, those ever diagnosed with an anxiety disorder (OR = .72, p = .02) and those ever diagnosed with more than one psychiatric diagnosis (OR = .74, p = .03) had lower abstinence rates. The diagnostic categories did not differ in smoking heaviness or the FTND, but they did differ in dependence motives assessed with the WISDM. Conclusion: Information on recent or lifetime psychiatric disorders may help clinicians gauge relapse risk and may suggest dependence motives that are particularly relevant to affected patients. These findings also illustrate the importance of using multidimensional tobacco dependence assessments.",1939838181, Correction/Retraction,2017
Outcomes of psychological therapies for prisoners with mental health problems: A systematic review and meta-analysis,"Objective: Prisoners worldwide have substantial mental health needs, but the efficacy of psychological therapy in prisons is unknown. We aimed to systematically review psychological therapies with mental health outcomes in prisoners and qualitatively summarize difficulties in conducting randomized clinical trials (RCTs). Method: We systematically identified RCTs of psychological therapies with mental health outcomes in prisoners (37 studies). Effect sizes were calculated and meta-analyzed. Eligible studies were assessed for quality. Subgroup and metaregression analyses were conducted to examine sources of between-study heterogeneity. Thematic analysis reviewed difficulties in conducting prison RCTs. Results: In 37 identified studies, psychological therapies showed a medium effect size (0.50, 95% CI [0.34, 0.66]) with high levels of heterogeneity with the most evidence for CBT and mindfulness-based trials. Studies that used no treatment (0.77, 95% CI [0.50, 1.03]) or waitlist controls (0.71, 95% CI [0.43, 1.00]) had larger effect sizes than those that had treatment-as-usual or other psychological therapies as controls (0.21, 95% CI [0.01, 0.41]). Effects were not sustained on follow-up at 3 and 6 months. No differences were found between group and individual therapy, or different treatment types. The use of a fidelity measure was associated with lower effect sizes. Qualitative analysis identified difficulties with follow-up and institutional constraints on scheduling and implementation of trials. Conclusions: CBT and mindfulness-based therapies are modestly effective in prisoners for depression and anxiety outcomes. In prisons with existing psychological therapies, more evidence is required before additional therapies can be recommended.",1939837194, Journal Article,2017
Cognitive-behavioral versus psychodynamic therapy for major depression: Secondary outcomes of a randomized clinical trial,"Objective: In a randomized clinical trial, we compared the efficacy of cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) and psychodynamic therapy for adult outpatient depression on measures of psychopathology, interpersonal functioning, pain, and quality of life. Method: There were 341 Dutch adults (70.1% female, mean age = 38.9, SD = 10.3) meeting Diagnostic and Statistical Manual for Mental Disorders-Fourth Edition (DSM-IV) criteria for a major depressive episode and with a Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAM-D) score ≥14, who were randomized to 16 sessions of individual manualized CBT or short-term psychodynamic supportive psychotherapy. Severely depressed patients (HAM-D &gt;24) received additional antidepressant medication according to a protocol. Outcome measures included the Brief Symptom Inventory, Beck Anxiety Inventory, Outcome Questionnaire, a visual analogue scale for pain, and EuroQol. Data were analyzed with mixed model analyses using intention-to-treat samples. Noninferiority margins were prespecified as Cohen's d = -0.30. Results: Across treatment conditions, 45-60% of the patients who completed posttreatment assessment showed clinically meaningful change for most outcome measures. We found no significant differences between the treatment conditions on any of the outcome measures at both posttreatment and follow-up. Noninferiority of psychodynamic therapy to CBT was shown for posttreatment and follow-up anxiety measures as well as for posttreatment pain and quality of life measures, but could not be consistently demonstrated for the other outcomes. Conclusions: This is the first study that shows that psychodynamic therapy can be at least as efficacious as CBT for depression on important aspects of patient functioning other than depressive symptom reduction. These findings extend the evidence-base of psychodynamic therapy for depression, but replication is needed by means of rigorously designed noninferiority trials.",1939838272," Evidence Based Healthcare , Journal Article",2017
A randomized clinical trial targeting anxiety sensitivity for patients with suicidal ideation,"Objective: Anxiety sensitivity (AS) is a well-established transdiagnostic risk factor for anxiety and mood psychopathology including suicide. A variety of interventions using cognitive-behavioral skills as well as cognitive bias modification (CBM) suggest that AS can be quickly and effectively reduced in nonclinical and nontreatment seeking samples. However, it is unclear whether AS reduction protocols will have efficacy for more severe clinical samples. Moreover, the combination of cognitive-behavioral techniques with CBM focused on changing interpretation bias (CBM-I) related to AS has not been evaluated. Method: A patient sample with co-occurring anxiety psychopathology and active suicidal ideation (N = 74) was randomly assigned to a brief 1-session computerized treatment including: (a) psychoeducation and interoceptive exposure (i.e., cognitive anxiety sensitivity treatment [CAST]) plus CBM-I for AS; or (b) health information condition plus sham CBM for AS. Participants were assessed immediately after the 1-hr intervention as well as at 1- and 4-month follow-ups. Results: Consistent with hypotheses, participants in the active treatment showed significantly greater AS reduction that was maintained through follow-up (effect sizes ranged from medium to large for the overall AS and the AS subscales). Mediation analyses suggested that changes in AS mediated suicide outcomes. Conclusions: In sum, these are the first findings to suggest that brief AS reduction protocols have efficacy both in terms of risk and symptom outcomes in patient samples showing active suicidal ideation.",1939232757," Evidence Based Healthcare , Journal Article",2017
"A functional analysis of two transdiagnostic, emotion-focused interventions on nonsuicidal self-injury","Objective: Nonsuicidal self-injury (NSSI) is prevalent and associated with clinically significant consequences. Developing time-efficient and cost-effective interventions for NSSI has proven difficult given that the critical components for NSSI treatment remain largely unknown. The aim of this study was to examine the specific effects of mindful emotion awareness training and cognitive reappraisal, 2 transdiagnostic treatment strategies that purportedly address the functional processes thought to maintain self-injurious behavior, on NSSI urges and acts. Method: Using a counterbalanced, combined series (multiple baseline and data-driven phase change) aggregated single-case experimental design, the unique and combined impact of these 2 4-week interventions was evaluated among 10 diagnostically heterogeneous self-injuring adults. Ecological momentary assessment was used to provide daily ratings of NSSI urges and acts during all study phases. Results: Eight of 10 participants demonstrated clinically meaningful reductions in NSSI; 6 participants responded to 1 intervention alone, whereas 2 participants responded after the addition of the alternative intervention. Group analyses indicated statistically significant overall effects of study phase on NSSI, with fewer NSSI urges and acts occurring after the interventions were introduced. The interventions were also associated with moderate to large reductions in self-reported levels of anxiety and depression, and large improvements in mindful emotion awareness and cognitive reappraisal skills. Conclusions: Findings suggest that brief mindful emotion awareness and cognitive reappraisal interventions can lead to reductions in NSSI urges and acts. Transdiagnostic, emotion-focused therapeutic strategies delivered in time-limited formats may serve as practical yet powerful treatment approaches, especially for lower-risk self-injuring individuals.",1939229266, Journal Article,2017
Effectiveness of an internet intervention (Deprexis) for depression in a united states adult sample: A parallel-group pragmatic randomized controlled trial,"Objective: To examine the effectiveness of an Internet intervention for depression with a randomized, controlled trial in a large sample of adults recruited from the United States. Method: The current study examines the effectiveness of Deprexis, an Internet treatment for depression that was provided with relatively minimal support. There were 376 treatment-seeking adults (mean age = 32 years; 74% female; 77% Caucasian, 7% Asian, 7% multiple races, 4% African American, and 11% Hispanic/Latino) with elevated depression (Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptoms-Self-Report [QIDS-SR] &gt; = 10) who were randomized to receive an 8-week course of treatment immediately (n = 285) or after an 8-week delay (n = 91; i.e., waitlist control). Results: Intention-to-treat analyses indicated that treatment was associated with greater reduction in self-reported symptoms of depression (effect size d = .80) and 12 times greater likelihood of experiencing at least 50% symptom improvement compared with waitlist control. Similar effects were observed for several secondary outcomes, such as interviewer-rated depression symptoms, well-being, and depression-related disability. Treatment effects for symptoms of social anxiety, panic, and traumatic intrusions were relatively small. Conclusion: Results suggest that Deprexis can produce symptomatic improvement among depressed adults recruited from the United States. Additional research is needed that examines whether improvements are maintained over time and who is particularly likely to respond to this form of treatment.",1884406363, Journal Article,2017
Randomized controlled trial of Triple P for parents of children with asthma or eczema: Effects on parenting and child behavior,"Objective: Parents play an important role in children's illness management, in promoting child adjustment and reducing behavior problems. Little research has focused on the evaluation of parenting interventions in the context of childhood chronic illness. The aim of this study was to test the efficacy of a brief, group parenting intervention (Healthy Living Triple P) in improving parenting skills and parent adjustment, and reducing child behavioral and emotional difficulties in the context of childhood asthma and eczema. Method: One hundred seven parents of children with a diagnosis of asthma and/or eczema were randomly assigned to intervention (n = 52) or care as usual (CAU; n = 55). Parents completed self-report measures of their child's behavioral and emotional adjustment, their own parenting, and their own level of adjustment at pre- and postintervention and at 6-month follow-up. Parent-child interactions were observed and coded at each time point. The intervention consisted of 2 group sessions of 2 hr each delivered by trained, accredited practitioners. Results: Attrition was low, with T2 and T3 assessment completed by 84.6% and 80.8% of intervention families and 92.7% and 81.8% of CAU families, respectively. Intention-to-treat analyses indicated that overall parent-reported ineffective parenting as well as parental overreactivity reduced as a result of intervention. Parent report of child behavior problems also decreased, but there were no changes in children's emotional adjustment. No changes in observed parent or child behavior were found. Stress reduced for parents in the intervention group compared to the CAU group, but there were no changes in parental anxiety or depression. Effects showed evidence of reliable and clinical change and were maintained at 6-month follow-up. Conclusions: The intervention shows promise as an addition to clinical services for children with asthma and eczema and may have broader application to other chronic health conditions.",1884406356, Journal Article,2017
Emotion-focused therapy for social anxiety disorder: Results from a multiple-baseline study,"Objective: The purpose of the present study was to evaluate the efficacy of emotion-focused therapy (EFT) for adults suffering from social anxiety disorder (SAD). Method: Using a nonconcurrent multiple-baseline design, 12 patients (mean age = 26.75 years, SD = 5.15; 7 males) meeting criteria for SAD were treated with up to 28 sessions of EFT. EFT was based on an empathic relationship, 2-chair work for self-criticism, empty-chair work for unresolved feelings, and focusing. Patients were randomized to wait 4, 8, or 12 weeks between the intake and the first therapy session. Intake assessment included the MINI International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI; Sheehan et al. 1998), the clinician-administered Liebowitz Social Anxiety Scale (LSAS; Liebowitz, 1987), and various self-report questionnaires. The LSAS was also administered at the end of the baseline period and at posttreatment. The MINI was administered again at posttreatment. Self-reports were administered throughout the baseline, before each therapy session, and at 6-month and 12-month follow-ups. Results: One patient dropped out prematurely. Of the 11 completers, 7 did not meet criteria for SAD at the end of treatment. Intent-to-treat analysis showed that LSAS scores did not change during baseline, significantly improved during treatment (Cohen's d = -2.37), and remained improved during follow-up. Mixed regression models showed that SAD symptoms and self-criticism did not change during baseline, significantly improved during treatment, and remained improved during follow-up. Self-reassurance improved significantly during the follow-up phase. Conclusion: This study provides initial evidence supporting the efficacy of EFT for SAD.",1872118754, Journal Article,2017
Excess weight gain prevention in adolescents: Three-year outcome following a randomized controlled trial,"Objective: Interpersonal psychotherapy (IPT) prevents weight gain in adults with obesity and binge-eating-disorder, and is especially effective among those with increased psychosocial problems. However, IPT was not superior to health education (HE) to prevent excess weight gain at 1-year follow-up in 113 adolescent girls at high-risk for excess weight gain because of loss-of-control eating and high body mass index (BMI; kg/m2; Tanofsky-Kraff et al., 2014). Method: Participants from the original trial were recontacted 3 years later for assessment. At baseline, adolescent- and parent-reported social-adjustment problems and trait anxiety were evaluated. At baseline and follow-ups, BMIz and adiposity by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry were obtained. Results: Nearly 60% were reassessed at 3 years, with no group differences in participation (ps ≥ .70). Consistent with 1 year, there was no main effect of group on change in BMIz/adiposity (ps ≥ .18). In exploratory analyses, baseline social-adjustment problems and trait-anxiety moderated outcome (ps &lt; .01). Among girls with high self-reported baseline social-adjustment problems or anxiety, IPT, compared to HE, was associated with the steepest declines in BMIz (p &lt; .001). For adiposity, girls with high or low anxiety in HE and girls with low anxiety in IPT experienced gains (ps ≤ .03), while girls in IPT with high anxiety stabilized. Parent-reports yielded complementary findings. Conclusion: In obesity-prone adolescent girls, IPT was not superior to HE in preventing excess weight gain at 3 years. Consistent with theory, exploratory analyses suggested that IPT was associated with improvements in BMIz over 3 years among youth with high social-adjustment problems or trait anxiety. Future studies should test the efficacy of IPT for obesity prevention among at-risk girls with social-adjustment problems and/or anxiety.",1872118749, Journal Article,2017
Omitted data in randomized controlled trials for anxiety and depression: A systematic review of the inclusion of sexual orientation and gender identity,"Objective: The current study examined the frequency with which randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of behavioral and psychological interventions for anxiety and depression include data pertaining to participant sexual orientation and nonbinary gender identities. Method: Using systematic review methodology, the databases PubMed and PsycINFO were searched to identify RCTs published in 2004, 2009, and 2014. Random selections of 400 articles per database per year (2,400 articles in total) were considered for inclusion in the review. Articles meeting inclusion criteria were read and coded by the research team to identify whether the trial reported data pertaining to participant sexual orientation and nonbinary gender identities. Additional trial characteristics were also identified and indexed in our database (e.g., sample size, funding source). Results: Of the 232 articles meeting inclusion criteria, only 1 reported participants' sexual orientation, and zero articles included nonbinary gender identities. A total of 52,769 participants were represented in the trials, 93 of which were conducted in the United States, and 43 acknowledged the National Institutes of Health as a source of funding. Conclusions: Despite known mental health disparities on the basis of sexual orientation and nonbinary gender identification, researchers evaluating interventions for anxiety and depression are not reporting on these important demographic characteristics. Reporting practices must change to ensure that our interventions generalize to lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender persons.",1855901178, Journal Article,2017
On the importance of temporal precedence in mediational analyses,"This response to the commentary by Gaynor (in press) (a) underscores the importance of defining terms (predictor, moderator, and mediator variables) used in psychological treatment outcome research, (b) notes the improvements in mediation analyses using treatment of youth anxiety as the illustration, and (c) encourages continued advancement in the methodology for mediation analyses. We agree with Gaynor (in press) both on the importance of temporal precedence and on the use of cautious language with regard to interpreting mediational analyses.",1855899675, Journal Article,2017
A pragmatic randomized clinical trial of behavioral activation for depressed pregnant women,"Objective: Depression among pregnant women is a prevalent public health problem associated with poor maternal and offspring development. Behavioral activation (BA) is a scalable intervention aligned with pregnant women's preference for nonpharmacological depression care. This is the first test of the effectiveness of BA for depression among pregnant women, which aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of BA as compared with treatment as usual (TAU). Method: Pregnant women (mean age = 28.75 years; SD = 5.67) with depression symptoms were randomly assigned to BA (n = 86) or TAU (n = 77). Exclusion criteria included known bipolar or psychotic disorder or immediate self-harm risk. Follow-up assessment occurred 5 and 10 weeks postrandomization and 3 months postpartum using self-report measures of primary and secondary outcomes and putative targets. Results: Compared with TAU, BA was associated with significantly lower depressive symptoms (d = 0.34, p = .04) and higher remission (56.3% vs. 30.3%, p = .003). BA also demonstrated significant advantage on anxiety and perceived stress. Participants attended most BA sessions and reported high satisfaction. Participants in BA reported significantly higher levels of activation (d = 0.69, p &lt; .0002) and environmental reward (d = 0.54, p &lt; .003) than those who received TAU, and early change in both of these putative targets significantly mediated subsequent depression outcomes. Conclusions: BA is effective for pregnant women, offering significant depression, anxiety, and stress benefits, with mediation analyses supporting the importance of putative targets of activation and environmental reward.",1855899623, Journal Article,2017
"Child STEPs in California: A cluster randomized effectiveness trial comparing modular treatment with community implemented treatment for youth with anxiety, depression, conduct problems, or traumatic stress","Objective: This study reports outcomes from a randomized effectiveness trial testing modular treatment versus multiple community-implemented evidence-based treatments for youth. Method: An ethnoracially diverse sample of 138 youth ages 5 to 15 (62 girls, 76 boys) whose primary clinical concerns involved diagnoses or clinical elevations related to anxiety, depression, disruptive behavior, and/or traumatic stress were treated by community therapists randomly assigned to 1 of 2 conditions: (a) modular treatment, which involved a single modular protocol (i.e., modular approach to therapy for children; MATCH) that allowed flexible selection and sequencing of procedures to fit the chosen treatment focus in the context of measurement feedback, and (b) community-implemented treatment (CIT), which was a county-supported implementation of multiple evidence-based practices for youth. Results: Youth treated with MATCH showed significantly faster rates of improvement over time on clinical and functional outcomes relative to youth in the CIT condition and required significantly fewer sessions delivered over significantly fewer days. Caregiver-reported clinical improvement rates were significantly greater for MATCH (60%) versus CIT (36.7%). Further, youth in the CIT condition were significantly more likely to receive additional psychosocial treatment services and were significantly more likely to use a variety of psychotropic medications during the active treatment phase. Conclusions: These results extend prior findings, supporting the effectiveness and efficiency of a modular, multifocus approach that incorporates monitoring and feedback relative to community implementation of evidence-based treatments.",1855898554, Journal Article,2017
"Temporal precedence in the identification of mediators of change: A brief comment on ""Mediators of change in the child/adolescent multimodal treatment study"" (Kendall et al., 2016)","Objective: Comment on the issue of temporal precedence and the implications for interpreting the results of the mediation analyses in the Child/Adolescent Multimodal Treatment Study. Method: Review of Kendall et al. (2016). Results: Kendall et al. reported that residualized (baseline to posttreatment) change in coping efficacy, but not anxious self-talk, mediated residualized (baseline to follow-up) change in anxiety symptoms in cognitive-behavior therapy (CBT), sertraline (SRT), and CBT + SRT compared to placebo. Because the measure of anxiety symptoms included data from follow-up, it was concluded that ""the gains being referred to can be viewed as 'change following treatment'"" (p. 8) and, therefore, the analyses captured ""true temporal precedence"" (p. 3). However, the anxiety scores represented an amalgam of change occurring within and after treatment, and available data suggest much of the anxiety change occurred during the treatment, the time when the change in coping occurred. Conclusions: Given the measurement timeline, a clear and unambiguous claim of demonstrating temporal precedence is not justified. Nonetheless, these results remain important for other reasons when interpreted in the context of the broad cognitive-behavioral conceptual model of anxiety that led to the selection of these mediators for examination.",1855897771, Journal Article,2017
The SENSE study: Post intervention effects of a randomized controlled trial of a cognitive-behavioral and mindfulness-based group sleep improvement intervention among at-risk adolescents,"Objective: Sleep problems are a major risk factor for the emergence of mental health problems in adolescence. The aim of this study was to investigate the post intervention effects of a cognitive-behavioral/mindfulness-based group sleep intervention on sleep and mental health among at-risk adolescents. Method: A randomized controlled trial (RCT) was conducted across High schools in Melbourne, Australia. One hundred forty-four adolescents (aged 12-17 years) with high levels of anxiety and sleeping difficulties, but without past or current depressive disorder, were randomized into either a sleep improvement intervention or an active control 'study skills' intervention. Both programs consisted of 7 90-min-long group sessions delivered over 7 weeks. One hundred twenty-three participants began the interventions (female = 60%; mean age = 14.48, SD = 0.95), with 60 in the sleep condition and 63 in the control condition. All participants were required to complete a battery of mood and sleep questionnaires, 7 days of wrist actigraphy (an objective measure of sleep), and sleep diary entry at pre- and-post intervention. Results: The sleep intervention condition was associated with significantly greater improvements in subjective sleep (global sleep quality [with a medium effect size], sleep onset latency, daytime sleepiness [with small effect sizes]), objective sleep (sleep onset latency [with a medium effect size]), and anxiety (with a small effect size) compared with the control intervention condition. Conclusion: The SENSE study provides evidence that a multicomponent group sleep intervention that includes cognitive-behavioral and mindfulness-based therapies can reduce sleep initiation problems and related daytime dysfunction, along with concomitant anxiety symptoms, among at-risk adolescents.",1845706320, Journal Article,2016
Cognitive models for panic disorder with agoraphobia: A study of disaggregated within-person effects,"Objective: The purpose of this study was to test 2 cognitive models of panic disorder with agoraphobia (PDA) -- a catastrophic cognitions model and a low self-efficacy model -- by examining the within-person effects of model-derived cognitive variables on subsequent anxiety symptoms. Method: Participants were 46 PDA patients with agoraphobic avoidance of moderate to severe degree who were randomly allocated to 6 weeks of either cognitive therapy, based on the catastrophic cognitions model of PDA, or guided mastery (guided exposure) therapy, based on the self-efficacy model of PDA. Cognitions and anxiety were measured weekly over the course of treatment. The data were analyzed with mixed models, using person-mean centering to disaggregate within- and between-person effects. Results: All of the studied variables changed in the expected way over the course of therapy. There was a within-person effect of physical fears, loss of control fears, social fears, and self-efficacy when alone on subsequent state anxiety. On the other hand, within-person changes in anxiety did not predict subsequent cognitions. Loss of control and social fears both predicted subsequent self-efficacy, whereas self-efficacy did not predict catastrophic cognitions. In a multipredictor analysis, within-person catastrophic cognitions still predicted subsequent anxiety, but self-efficacy when alone did not. Conclusions: Overall, the findings indicate that anxiety in PDA, at least in severe and long-standing cases, is driven by catastrophic cognitions. Thus, these cognitions seem to be useful therapeutic targets.",1819435380, Journal Article,2016
Integrating motivational interviewing with cognitive-behavioral therapy for severe generalized anxiety disorder: An allegiance-controlled randomized clinical trial,"Objective: Although integrating motivational interviewing (MI) and cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) has been recommended for treating anxiety, few well-controlled tests of such integration exist. Method: In the present randomized trial for severe generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), we compared the efficacy of 15 sessions of CBT alone (N = 43) versus 4 MI sessions followed by 11 CBT sessions integrated with MI to address client resistance/ambivalence (N = 42). Clients were adults, predominantly female and Caucasian, with a high rate of diagnostic comorbidity. To control for allegiance, therapists were nested within treatment group and supervised separately by experts in the respective treatments. Results: Piecewise multilevel models revealed no between-groups differences in outcomes from pre- to posttreatment; however, there were treatment effects over the follow-up period with MI-CBT clients demonstrating a steeper rate of worry decline (γ = -0.13, p = .03) and general distress reduction (γ = -0.12, p = .01) than CBT alone clients. Also, the odds of no longer meeting GAD diagnostic criteria were ~5 times higher at 12-months for clients receiving MI-CBT compared with CBT alone. There were also twice as many dropouts in CBT alone compared with MI-CBT (23% vs. 10%); a difference that approached significance (p = .09). The treatments were competently delivered, and intraclass correlations revealed negligible between-therapist effects on the outcomes. Conclusions: The findings support the integration of MI with CBT for severe GAD and point to the importance of training therapists in appropriate responsivity to in-session markers of resistance and ambivalence.",1819435379, Journal Article,2016
Attention bias dynamics and symptom severity during and following CBT for social anxiety disorder,"Objective: Threat-related attention bias figures prominently in contemporary accounts of the maintenance of anxiety disorders, yet longitudinal intervention research relating attention bias to anxiety symptom severity is limited. Capitalizing on recent advances in the conceptualization and measurement of attention bias, we aimed to examine the relation between attention bias, indexed using trial-level bias scores (TLBSs) to quantify temporal dynamics reflecting dysregulation of attentional processing of threat (as opposed to aggregated mean bias scores) and social anxiety symptom severity over the course of cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) and 1-month follow-up. Method: Adults with social anxiety disorder (N = 39) assigned to either yohimbine- or placebo-augmented CBT completed measures of attention bias and social anxiety symptom severity weekly throughout CBT (5 sessions) and at 1-week and 1-month posttreatment. Results: TLBSs of attention bias temporal dynamics showed stronger psychometric properties than mean aggregated scores and were highly interrelated, in line with within-subject temporal variability fluctuating in time between attentional overengagement and strategic avoidance from threat. Attention bias toward threat and temporal variability in attention bias (i.e., attentional dysregulation), but not attention bias away from threat, significantly reduced over the course of CBT. Cross-lag analyses revealed no evidence of a causal relation between reductions in attentional dysregulation leading to symptom severity reduction, or vice versa. Observed relations did not vary as a function of time. Conclusions: We found no evidence for attentional dysregulation as a causal mechanism for symptom reduction in CBT for social anxiety disorders. Implications for future research are discussed.",1819435366, Journal Article,2016
Responsive management of early resistance in cognitive-behavioral therapy for generalized anxiety disorder,"Objective: Client resistance limits the efficacy of cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), rendering it an important process marker for clinicians. Yet, little is known about how CBT therapists&apos; responsively navigate resistance. This study examined whether differences in therapists&apos; behavior during moments of early resistance in CBT predict distal (posttreatment worry) and proximal (subsequent resistance) therapy outcomes. We hypothesized that clinicians&apos; use of supportive, motivational interviewing (MI)-consistent strategies versus directive CBT methods during resistance episodes would relate to more favorable outcomes. Method: Clients (N = 30) with severe generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) were treated with CBT (without MI) in the context of a randomized controlled trial. An adapted version of the Client Resistance Code was used to identify moments of client disagreement with therapist direction, and these episodes were rated for therapist behavior using the Motivational Interviewing Treatment Integrity (MITI). Context-specific variations in therapists&apos; MITI ratings during disagreement were compared with variations in ratings during randomly selected moments to examine whether the timing of therapist use of theoretically indicated MI skills differentially impacted outcomes. Results: Clients whose therapists displayed greater MI-consistent responses during disagreement had lower levels of posttreatment worry, t = -2.84, p = .009, and subsequent resistance, t = -2.96, p = .013. Additionally, MI-consistent behavior during disagreement was substantially related to treatment outcomes, but MI-like behavior during randomly selected therapy segments was not (t = -.15, p = .886 for posttreatment worry, and t = -.09, p = .934 for subsequent resistance). Conclusions: Findings support the importance of context-responsivity to resistance markers, suggesting that systematic incorporation of MI for managing resistance holds promise for improving CBT for GAD.",1819434939, Journal Article,2016
Impact of comorbid anxiety and depressive disorders on treatment response to cognitive behavior therapy for insomnia,"To evaluate the impact of comorbid anxiety or depressive disorders on treatment response to cognitive-behavior therapy (CBT) for insomnia, behavior therapy (BT), or cognitive therapy (CT). Participants were 188 adults (117 women; M age = 47.4 years) with chronic insomnia, including 45 also presenting a comorbid anxiety or mild to moderate depressive disorder. They were randomized to BT (n = 63), CT (n = 65), or CBT (n = 60). Outcome measures were the proportion of treatment responders (decrease of ≥8 points on the Insomnia Severity Index; ISI) and remissions (ISI score &lt; 8) and depression and anxiety symptoms. Proportion of treatment responders and remitters in the CBT condition was not significantly different between the subgroups with and without comorbidity. However, the proportion of responders was lower in the comorbidity subgroup compared to those without comorbidity in both the BT (34.4% vs. 81.6%; p = .007) and CT (23.6% vs. 57.6%; p = .02) alone conditions, although remission rates and prepost ISI change scores were not. Pre to post change scores on the depression (-10.6 vs. -3.9; p &lt; .001) and anxiety measures (-9.2 vs. -2.5; p = .01) were significantly greater in the comorbidity subgroup relative to the subgroup without comorbidity but only for those treated with the full CBT; no difference was found for those treated with either BT or CT alone. The presence of a comorbid anxiety or mild to moderate depressive disorder did not reduce the efficacy of CBT for insomnia, but it did for its single BT and CT components when used alone.",1806429756, Journal Article,2016
A randomized clinical trial of a supportive versus a skill-based couple-focused group intervention for breast cancer patient,"The aims of this study were to evaluate the efficacy of the 2 types of couple-focused group interventions on couples&apos; psychological and relationship functioning, and to examine possible moderators for each intervention. Three hundred and two women with early stage breast cancer who were recruited within 1 year of diagnosis and their spouses were randomly assigned to either an 8 session enhanced couple-focused group intervention (ECG) or a couples&apos; support group (SG). Couples completed surveys at 4 time points: preintervention, 1 week postgroup, 6 months, and 1 year. Analyses indicated that anxiety, depressive symptoms, and cancer-specific distress declined and positive well-being improved for couples enrolled in both ECG and SG. Thus, neither treatment was superior in terms of reduction of distress or improvements in positive well-being. Moderator effects indicated that, among patients reporting higher levels of cancer-specific preintervention distress, anxiety, depression, and well-being over the 1-year postintervention time period were significantly lower among SG couples than ECG couples. When patient cancer-specific preintervention distress was low, these 3 outcomes were more positive in ECG relative to SG. A similar pattern with regard to anxiety was illustrated when the moderator effects for perceived partner unsupportive behavior was examined, and a similar pattern was seen for anxiety and well-being for preintervention marital satisfaction. A couple-focused supportive group therapy may be more effective for distressed patients, whereas a structured, skills-based couples&apos; group therapy may be more effective for less distressed patients.",1806429755, Journal Article,2016
The moderating role of internalized homonegativity on the efficacy of LGB-affirmative psychotherapy: Results from a randomized controlled trial with young adult gay and bisexual men,"As empirical evidence for the effectiveness of LGB-affirmative psychotherapy emerges, the question of whether some clients may derive greater benefit than others becomes important. The current study investigated whether internalized homonegativity (IH), both explicit and implicit, moderated the efficacy of a cognitive-behavioral intervention designed to improve the mental and sexual health of young gay and bisexual men through facilitating minority stress coping. At baseline, young gay and bisexual men (n = 54) experiencing symptoms of depression and anxiety completed measures of explicit and implicit IH. Participants also completed self-reports of mental health and an interviewer-based assessment of past-90-day risk behavior before and after treatment in a 10-session individual LGB-affirmative intervention. Moderation analyses showed that participants higher in implicit IH experienced greater reductions in depression (b = -2.99, p = .031, 95% confidence interval [CI] [-5.69, -0.29]), anxiety (b = -3.56, p = .014, 95% CI [-6.35, -0.76]), and past-90-day condomless anal sex with casual partners (b = -1.29, p = .028, 95% CI [-2.44, -0.14]). Participants higher in explicit IH experienced greater reductions in past-90-day heavy drinking (b = -0.42, p = .003, 95% CI [-0.69, -0.15]). These findings indicate that greater gains from LGB-affirmative psychotherapy were observed in gay and bisexual men who were higher in IH, particularly when measured implicitly. As the first study that examines factors moderating the efficacy of LGB-affirmative psychotherapy, the present research has important implications for intervention development and highlights the value of incorporating implicit measures into clinical work.",1802451001, Journal Article,2016
The role of setting versus treatment type in alliance within youth therapy,"Does the strength of the youth-therapist alliance differ across treatment settings or treatment type? We examined these questions in the context of youth therapy. Eighty-nine youths (M age = 10.56, SD = 1.99; 63.70% Caucasian; 52.80% male) diagnosed with an anxiety disorder received (a) manual-based individual cognitive-behavioral therapy (ICBT) in a research setting, (b) manual-based ICBT in practice settings, or (c) nonmanualized usual care (UC) in practice settings. Coders, using the Therapy Process Observational Coding System-Alliance scale, rated 865 sessions. Youth completed the Therapeutic Alliance Scale for Children at posttreatment. Youth who received ICBT in a research setting had significantly higher observer-rated alliance than youth who received either therapy delivered in practice settings. In practice settings, youth who received ICBT had significantly stronger observer-rated alliance early in treatment than youth in UC, but this difference was not observed at the end of treatment. Similarly, youth-report alliance at posttreatment was significantly higher in ICBT in the research setting, and there was no difference between ICBT and UC delivered in practice settings. Alliance differences largely held when controlling for youth characteristics; however, differences early in treatment between the ICBT groups were no longer statistically significant when controlling for anxiety severity or primary anxiety diagnosis. Our findings suggest that (a) the alliance may be stronger in research settings, and (b) treatment manuals do not undermine alliance. Future research is required to help pinpoint whether other youth, therapist, or setting factors contribute to the lower alliance seen in practice settings.",1789533825, Journal Article,2016
A randomized clinical trial of a parent-focused social-cognitive processing intervention for caregivers of children undergoing hematopoetic stem cell transplantation,"Providing care to one&apos;s child during and after a hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) is a universally stressful experience, but few psychological interventions have been developed to reduce caregiver distress. The goal of this study was to test the efficacy of a brief cognitive-behavioral intervention delivered to primary caregivers. Two hundred eighteen caregivers were assigned either best-practice psychosocial care (BPC) or a parent social-cognitive intervention program (P-SCIP). The 5 session P-SCIP was delivered during the HSCT hospitalization. Caregivers completed measures of distress, optimism, coping, and fear appraisals preintervention, 1, 6 months, and 1 year. P-SCIP reduced caregiver&apos;s distress significantly more than BPC between the pretransplant assessment (Time 1) and 1-month follow-up assessment (Time 2). P-SCIP had a stronger effect than BPC among caregivers who began the hospitalization reporting higher depression and anxiety, and among caregivers whose children developed graft-versus-host disease (GvHD). Long-term treatment effects of P-SCIP were seen in traumatic distress among caregivers who reported higher anxiety pretransplant as well as among caregivers whose children had GvHD at HSCT discharge. Screening caregivers for elevations in pretransplant anxiety and targeting interventions specifically to these caregivers, as well as targeting caregivers to children who develop GvHD, may prove beneficial.",1789533328, Journal Article,2016
Group CBT versus MBSR for social anxiety disorder: A randomized controlled trial,"The goal of this study was to investigate treatment outcome and mediators of cognitive-behavioral group therapy (CBGT) versus mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) versus waitlist (WL) in patients with generalized social anxiety disorder (SAD). One hundred eight unmedicated patients (55.6% female; mean age = 32.7 years, SD = 8.0; 43.5% Caucasian, 39% Asian, 9.3% Hispanic, 8.3% other) were randomized to CBGT versus MBSR versus WL and completed assessments at baseline, posttreatment/WL, and at 1-year follow-up, including the Liebowitz Social Anxiety Scale -- Self-Report (primary outcome; Liebowitz, 1987) as well as measures of treatment-related processes. Linear mixed model analysis showed that CBGT and MBSR both produced greater improvements on most measures compared with WL. Both treatments yielded similar improvements in social anxiety symptoms, cognitive reappraisal frequency and self-efficacy, cognitive distortions, mindfulness skills, attention focusing, and rumination. There were greater decreases in subtle avoidance behaviors following CBGT than MBSR. Mediation analyses revealed that increases in reappraisal frequency, mindfulness skills, attention focusing, and attention shifting, and decreases in subtle avoidance behaviors and cognitive distortions, mediated the impact of both CBGT and MBSR on social anxiety symptoms. However, increases in reappraisal self-efficacy and decreases in avoidance behaviors mediated the impact of CBGT (vs. MBSR) on social anxiety symptoms. CBGT and MBSR both appear to be efficacious for SAD. However, their effects may be a result of both shared and unique changes in underlying psychological processes.",1789533316, Journal Article,2016
"Mechanisms of personality-targeted intervention effects on adolescent alcohol misuse, internalizing and externalizing symptoms","This study aims to explore the mechanisms of personality-targeted intervention effects on problematic drinking, internalizing and externalizing symptoms. As part of a cluster-randomized trial, 1,210 high-risk students (mean age 13.7 years) in 19 London high schools (42.6% White, 54% male) were identified using the Substance Use Risk Profile Scale. Intervention school participants were invited to participate in personality-matched interventions by trained school staff. MacKinnon&apos;s products of coefficients method was used to compare 3 complementary mechanism hypotheses, namely, whether early changes in (a) alcohol use, (b) internalizing and externalizing symptoms, or (c) personality during the 6 months postintervention accounted for intervention effects over 2 years. Early intervention effects on drinking behaviors during the 6 months postintervention partially accounted for longer term intervention effects on the onset of binge drinking (95% confidence interval [CI] [-.349, -.062]) and drinking problems (95% CI [-.206, -.016]) over 2 years. Intervention effects on anxiety symptoms and conduct problems were partially mediated by early reductions in depressive symptoms (95% CI [-.013, -.001]; 95% CI [-.047, -.001]), and intervention effects on internalizing symptoms were also partially mediated by reductions in anxiety sensitivity (95% CI [-.003, 0]). 2-year intervention effects on problematic drinking were largely accounted for by early changes in drinking behaviors, and were not mediated by changes in mental health symptoms or personality risk factors. Early improvements in mood and anxiety sensitivity partially mediated longer term reductions in mental health problems.",1789526312, Journal Article,2016
Cognitive-behavioral therapy augmentation of SSRI reduces cortisol levels in older adults with generalized anxiety disorder: A randomized clinical trial,"Elevated cortisol in stress and aging, such as has been seen in late-life anxiety disorders, is postulated to accelerate cognitive and physiological decline in this large and increasing population. Selective serotonin-reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) are both effective treatments for generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) in older adults. On the other hand, there is very little research examining the effect of combining these therapies on peak cortisol levels. For the current analyses, we examined the effectiveness of CBT augmentation on peak cortisol levels in older adults diagnosed with GAD. The sample consisted of 42 individuals with late-life GAD who received an acute course of the SSRI escitalopram and then entered a 16-week randomized phase. Twenty-one participants were randomized to receive 16 sessions of CBT in addition to continuing escitalopram and the remaining 21 participants continued on escitalopram without CBT. Generalized estimating equations were performed to assess the effectiveness of CBT augmentation on peak cortisol levels (30 min after waking). Older adults with GAD who received both escitalopram and CBT demonstrated a significant reduction in peak cortisol levels at posttreatment compared to the group who received escitalopram without CBT augmentation. CBT augmentation of SSRI treatment reduced peak cortisol levels for older adults with GAD. Since persistently high cortisol levels in aging are thought to increase age-related cognitive and medical problems, our findings suggest that there may be a benefit to health and cognition of CBT augmentation for late-life anxiety disorders.",1778769208, Journal Article,2016
Does cognitive reappraisal reduce anxiety? A daily diary study of a micro-intervention with individuals with high social anxiety,"To examine emotion regulation (ER) among individuals with high (HSA) and low social anxiety (LSA) and the effects of 1 week of practiced cognitive reappraisal using self-report, daily diary measures and lab tasks. HSAs received reappraisal (HSA-R; n = 43) or monitoring (HSA-M; n = 40) instructions. LSAs received monitoring instructions (LSA-M; n = 41). Self-report measures of social anxiety and ER, and a lab task of reappraisal were administered at baseline and after 1 week. Daily diaries of anxiety and ER were also collected. At baseline, HSAs compared with LSAs reported lower self-efficacy of reappraisal and higher frequency and self-efficacy of suppression, but no differences emerged in the reappraisal task. Following the intervention, the HSA-R compared with the HSA-M reported lower symptom severity, greater self-efficacy of reappraisal but equal daily anxiety. HSA-R used reappraisal mostly combined with suppression (74.76% of situations). Post hoc analyses demonstrated that clinical diagnosis, but not severity, moderated the intervention effect. The results demonstrate the efficacy of a short intervention in social anxiety, and provide additional areas of research for improving its treatment.",1774190569, Journal Article,2016
Dynamic relationships of therapist alliance and group cohesion in transdiagnostic group CBT for anxiety disorders,"Little is known about the temporal variability of the alliance-symptom change and cohesion-symptom change relationships over the course of group therapy. These questions were examined in a sample of 373 clients receiving a transdiagnostic cognitive behavior therapy (tCBT), which culled the principle research-supported mechanisms of change for anxiety disorders. The authors examined relationships between the client versions of the Working Alliance Inventory and Group Cohesion Scale in predicting subsequent symptom change, as assessed by the state scale of the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory. Alliance and cohesion were significant predictors of next session anxiety scores. The alliance was consistently associated with anxiety symptoms (rs = -.152 to -.198, ps &lt; .05), but cohesion only showed significant relationships with anxiety symptoms at Sessions 8 and 10 (Session 8, r = -.233, p = .020, and 10, r = -.236, p = .027). Alliance-anxiety relations remained constant, whereas cohesion-anxiety relations substantially increased from earlier to later sessions. Differences that were obtained in the relation of alliance and cohesion with anxiety symptoms suggests that these processes have different roles within group tCBT. If replicated, the present findings would suggest that the dynamic relationships between alliance and cohesion and symptoms within group CBT for anxiety disorders have been an important omission in process-outcome studies.",1765603178, Journal Article,2016
Concurrent treatment of posttraumatic stress disorder and alcohol dependence: Predictors and moderators of outcome,"The present study examined predictors and moderators of treatment response among 165 adults meeting Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, fourth edition criteria for comorbid posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and alcohol dependence (AD), who were randomized to 24 weeks of Naltrexone (NAL), NAL and prolonged exposure (PE), pill placebo, or pill placebo and PE. All participants received supportive counseling for alcohol use. Six domains of predictors or moderators (23 variables) were evaluated using measures of PTSD (Posttraumatic Stress Symptom Scale Interview) and AD (days drinking from the timeline follow-back interview) collected every 4 weeks throughout treatment. Multilevel modeling with the Fournier approach was used to evaluate predictors and moderators of rates of symptom improvement and posttreatment outcomes. Combat trauma, sexual assault trauma, and higher baseline anxiety sensitivity predicted slower improvement and poorer PTSD outcome. Combat trauma, White race, and higher baseline drinking severity predicted poorer drinking outcome. PTSD severity moderated the efficacy of PE on PTSD outcomes, such that the benefit of PE over no-PE was greater for participants with higher baseline PTSD severity. Baseline depressive severity moderated the efficacy of PE on drinking outcomes, whereby the benefit of PE over no-PE was greater for participants with higher depressive symptoms. NAL effects were most beneficial for those with the longest duration of AD. These results suggest that concurrent, trauma-focused treatment should be recommended for PTSD-AD patients who present with moderate or severe baseline PTSD and depressive symptoms. Future research should examine the mechanisms underlying poorer outcome among identified subgroups of PTSD-AD patients.",1761494175, Journal Article,2016
Mediators of change in the Child/Adolescent Anxiety Multimodal Treatment Study,"Test changes in (a) coping efficacy and (b) anxious self-talk as potential mediators of treatment gains at 3-month follow-up in the Child/Adolescent Anxiety Multimodal Treatment Study (CAMS). Participants were 488 youth (ages 7-17; 50.4% male) randomized to cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT; Coping cat program), pharmacotherapy (sertraline), their combination, or pill placebo. Participants met Diagnostic and Statistical Manual for Mental Disorders-Fourth Edition (DSM-IV) criteria for generalized anxiety disorder, social phobia, and/or separation anxiety disorder. Coping efficacy (reported ability to manage anxiety provoking situations) was measured by youth and parent reports on the Coping Questionnaire, and anxious self-talk was measured by youth report on the Negative Affectivity Self-Statement Questionnaire. Outcome was measured using the Pediatric Anxiety Rating Scale (completed by Independent Evaluators blind to condition). For temporal precedence, residualized treatment gains were assessed at 3-month follow-up. Residualized gains in coping efficacy mediated gains in the CBT, sertraline, and combination conditions. In the combination condition, some unique effect of treatment remained. Treatment assignment was not associated with a reduction in anxious self-talk, nor did anxious self-talk predict changes in anxiety symptoms. The findings suggest that improvements in coping efficacy are a mediator of treatment gains. Anxious self-talk did not emerge as a mediator.",1761494021, Journal Article,2016
Identifying moderators of the adherence-outcome relation in cognitive therapy for depression,"  Little is known about the influence of patients' pretreatment characteristics on the adherence-outcome relation in cognitive therapy (CT) for depression. In a sample of 57 depressed adults participating in CT, the authors examined interactions between pretreatment patient characteristics and therapist adherence in predicting session-to-session symptom change. Using items from the Collaborative Study Psychotherapy Rating Scale, the authors assessed 3 facets of therapist adherence: cognitive methods, negotiating/structuring, and behavioral methods/homework. Two graduate students rated Sessions 1-4 for adherence. Symptoms were assessed prior to each session with the Beck Depression Inventory-II. Moderators were assessed as part of patients' intake evaluations. After correcting for multiple comparisons, patient gender remained a significant moderator of the relationship between cognitive methods and next-session symptom change; cognitive methods more strongly predicted greater symptom improvement for women as compared to men. Pretreatment anxiety and number of prior depressive episodes were significant moderators of the relationship between behavioral methods/homework and next-session symptom change, with greater behavioral methods/homework predicting symptom improvement more strongly among patients high in pretreatment anxiety and among patients with relatively few prior depressive episodes. This is the first study to provide evidence of how therapist adherence is differentially related to outcome among depressed patients with different characteristics. If replicated, these findings may inform clinical decisions regarding the use of specific facets of adherence in CT for depression with specific patients.",1717310375, Feature,2015
LGB-affirmative cognitive-behavioral therapy for young adult gay and bisexual men: A randomized controlled trial of a transdiagnostic minority stress approach,"  We tested the preliminary efficacy of a transdiagnostic cognitive-behavioral treatment adapted to improve depression, anxiety, and co-occurring health risks (i.e., alcohol use, sexual compulsivity, condomless sex) among young adult gay and bisexual men. Treatment adaptations focused on reducing minority stress processes that underlie sexual orientation-related mental health disparities. Young gay and bisexual men (n = 63; M age = 25.94) were randomized to immediate treatment or a 3-month waitlist. At baseline, 3-month, and 6-month assessments, participants completed self-reports of mental health and minority stress and an interview of past-90-day risk behavior.Compared to waitlist, treatment significantly reduced depressive symptoms (b = -2.43, 95% CI: -4.90, 0.35, p &lt; .001), alcohol use problems (b = -3.79, 95% CI: -5.94, -1.64, p &lt; .001), sexual compulsivity (b = -5.09, 95% CI: -8.78, -1.40, p &lt; .001), and past-90-day condomless sex with casual partners (b = -1.09, 95% CI: -1.80, -0.37, p &lt; .001), and improved condom use self-efficacy (b = 10.08, 95% CI: 3.86, 16.30, p &lt; .001). The treatment yielded moderate and marginally significant greater improvements than waitlist in anxiety symptoms (b = -2.14, 95% CI: -4.61, 0.34, p = .09) and past-90-day heavy drinking (b = -0.32, 95% CI: -0.71, 0.07, p = .09). Effects were generally maintained at follow-up. Minority stress processes showed small improvements in the expected direction. This study demonstrated preliminary support for the first intervention adapted to address gay and bisexual men's co-occurring health problems at their source in minority stress. If found to be efficacious compared to standard evidence-based treatments, the treatment will possess substantial potential for helping clinicians translate LGB-affirmative treatment guidelines into evidence-based practice.",1717310359, Feature,2015
The mental health of sexual minority adults in and out of the closet: A population-based study,"  Previous studies have found that sexual orientation concealment affords escape from stigma and discrimination but also creates a psychological toll. While disclosure alleviates the mental burden of concealment, it invites the stress of navigating a new public identity. Population-based samples that include both ""in"" and ""out"" sexual minorities provide an ideal opportunity to resolve limitations and inconsistencies of previous nonprobability investigations into the mental health correlates of concealment and disclosure. Sexual minority participants in the California Quality of Life Survey (n = 2,083) indicated whether and when they first disclosed their sexual orientation to others. Prevalence of 1-year major depressive disorder and generalized anxiety disorder was derived from the Composite International Diagnostic Interview-Short Form. Closeted men (n = 84) were less likely to be depressed than out men, n = 1,047; odds ratio (OR) = 0.41; 95% CI [0.17, 0.996]. Men who were recently out (n = 201) experienced higher odds of major depressive disorder, OR = 6.21; 95% CI [1.53, 24.47], and generalized anxiety disorder, OR = 5.51; 95% CI [1.51, 20.13], as compared to closeted men. Men who were distantly out (n = 846) also experienced higher odds of major depressive disorder than men who were closeted, OR = 2.91; 95% CI [1.10, 7.69]. Recently out women (n = 243) experienced lower odds of depression than closeted women, n = 63; OR = 0.21; 95% CI [0.05, 0.96]. Whether being in or out of the closet is associated with depression and anxiety largely depends on gender. Clinical and policy implications are discussed in terms of the unique stressors facing men and women both in and out of the closet.",1717310275, Feature,2015
Adult attachment as a moderator of treatment outcome for generalized anxiety disorder: Comparison between cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) plus supportive listening and CBT plus interpersonal and emotional processing therapy,"  To determine whether baseline dimensions of adult insecure attachment (avoidant and anxious) moderated outcome in a secondary analysis of a randomized controlled trial comparing cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) plus supportive listening (CBT + SL) versus CBT plus interpersonal and emotional processing therapy (CBT + I/EP). Eighty-three participants diagnosed with generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) were recruited from the community and assigned randomly to CBT + SL (n = 40) or to CBT + I/EP (n = 43) within a study using an additive design. PhD-level psychologists treated participants. Blind assessors evaluated participants at pretreatment, posttreatment, 6-month, 12-month, and 2-year follow-up with a composite of self-report and assessor-rated GAD symptom measures (Penn State Worry Questionnaire, Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale, Clinician's Severity Rating). Avoidant and anxious attachment were assessed using self-reported dismissing and angry states of mind, respectively, on the Perceptions of Adult Attachment Questionnaire. Consistent with our prediction, at all assessments higher levels of dismissing styles in those who received CBT + I/EP predicted greater change in GAD symptoms compared with those who received CBT + SL for whom dismissiveness was unrelated to the change. At postassessment, higher angry attachment was associated with less change in GAD symptoms for those receiving CBT + I/EP, compared with CBT + SL, for whom anger was unrelated to change in GAD symptoms. Pretreatment attachment-related anger failed to moderate outcome at other time points and therefore, these moderation effects were more short-lived than the ones for dismissing attachment. When compared with CBT + SL, CBT + I/EP may be better for individuals with GAD who have relatively higher dismissing styles of attachment.",1717310229, Feature,2015
Bounce back: Effectiveness of an elementary school-based intervention for multicultural children exposed to traumatic events,"  To evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of a school-based intervention for diverse children exposed to a range of traumatic events, and to examine its effectiveness in improving symptoms of posttraumatic stress, depression, and anxiety. Participants were 74 schoolchildren (Grades 1-5) and their primary caregivers. All participating students endorsed clinically significant posttraumatic stress symptoms. School clinicians were trained to deliver Bounce Back, a 10-session cognitive-behavioral group intervention. Children were randomized to immediate or delayed (3-month waitlist) intervention. Parent- and child-report of posttraumatic stress and depression, and child report of anxiety symptoms, were assessed at baseline, 3 months, and 6 months. Bounce Back was implemented with excellent clinician fidelity. Compared with children in the delayed condition, children who received Bounce Back immediately demonstrated significantly greater improvements in parent- and child-reported posttraumatic stress and child-reported anxiety symptoms over the 3-month intervention. Upon receipt of the intervention, the delayed intervention group demonstrated significant improvements in parent- and child-reported posttraumatic stress, depression, and anxiety symptoms. The immediate treatment group maintained or showed continued gains in all symptom domains over the 3-month follow-up period (6-month assessment). Findings support the feasibility, acceptability, and effectiveness of the Bounce Back intervention as delivered by school-based clinicians for children with traumatic stress. Implications are discussed.",1717310072, Feature,2015
Effectiveness of Internet-based cognitive-behavior therapy for social anxiety disorder in clinical psychiatry,"  Internet-based cognitive-behavioral therapy (ICBT) has received increased attention as an innovative approach to improve access to evidence-based psychological treatments. Although the efficacy of ICBT for social anxiety disorder has been established in several studies, there is limited knowledge of its effectiveness and application in clinical psychiatric care. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of ICBT in the treatment of social anxiety disorder and to determine the significance of patient adherence and the clinic's years of experience in delivering ICBT. A longitudinal cohort study was conducted using latent growth curve modeling of patients (N = 654) treated with ICBT at an outpatient psychiatric clinic between 2009 and 2013. The primary outcome measure was the Liebowitz Social Anxiety Scale-Self-Rated. Significant reductions in symptoms of social anxiety were observed after treatment (effect size d = 0.86, 99% CI [0.74, 0.98]). Improvements were sustained at 6-month follow-up (d = 1.15, 99% CI [0.99, 1.32]). Patient adherence had a positive effect on the rate of improvement. A positive association between the clinic's years of experience with ICBT and treatment outcome was also observed. This study suggests that ICBT for social anxiety disorder is effective when delivered within the context of a unit specialized in Internet-based psychiatric care and may be considered as a treatment alternative for implementation within the mental health care system.",1717310010, Feature,2015
Cognitive therapy versus exposure therapy for hypochondriasis (health anxiety): A randomized controlled trial,"  Cognitive-behavioral therapy has proven to be highly effective in the treatment of hypochondriasis and health anxiety. However, little is known about which therapeutic interventions are most promising. The aim of the present study was to compare the efficacy of cognitive therapy (CT) with exposure therapy (ET). Eighty-four patients with a diagnosis of hypochondriasis were randomly allocated to CT, ET, or a waiting list (WL) control group. The primary outcome measure was a standardized interview that evaluated hypochondriacal cognitions as well as behaviors conducted by independent diagnosticians. Several self-report questionnaires were evaluated as secondary outcome measures. Treatment success was evaluated at posttreatment and at 1-year follow-up. Both CT (Hedges's g = 1.01-1.11) and ET (Hedges's g = 1.21-1.24) demonstrated their efficacy in comparison with the WL in the primary outcome measure. Moreover, a significant reduction in depressive symptoms and bodily complaints was found in the secondary outcome measures for both treatments in comparison with the WL, but anxiety symptoms were only significantly reduced by ET. In a direct comparison, no significant differences were found between CT and ET in the primary or the secondary outcome measures. Regarding safety behaviors, we found a significantly larger improvement with ET than with CT in the completer analyses. The results suggest high efficacy of CT as well as ET in the treatment of hypochondriasis. Cognitive interventions were not a necessary condition for the change of dysfunctional cognitions. These findings are relevant to the conceptualization and psychotherapeutic treatment of hypochondriasis and health anxiety.",1701612892, Feature,2015
Internet-based cognitive - behavior therapy for procrastination: A randomized controlled trial,"  Procrastination can be a persistent behavior pattern associated with personal distress. However, research investigating different treatment interventions is scarce, and no randomized controlled trial has examined the efficacy of cognitive-behavior therapy (CBT). Meanwhile, Internet-based CBT has been found promising for several conditions, but has not yet been used for procrastination. Participants (N = 150) were randomized to guided self-help, unguided self-help, and wait-list control. Outcome measures were administered before and after treatment, or weekly throughout the treatment period. They included the Pure Procrastination Scale, the Irrational Procrastination Scale, the Susceptibility to Temptation Scale, the Montgomery Asberg Depression Rating Scale-Self-report version, the Generalized Anxiety Disorder Assessment, and the Quality of Life Inventory. The intention-to-treat principle was used for all statistical analyses. Mixed-effects models revealed moderate between-groups effect sizes comparing guided and unguided self-help with wait-list control; the Pure Procrastination Scale, Cohen's d = 0.70, 95% confidence interval (CI) [0.29, 1.10], and d = 0.50, 95% CI [0.10, 0.90], and the Irrational Procrastination Scale, d = 0.81 95% CI [0.40, 1.22], and d = 0.69 95% CI [0.29, 1.09]. Clinically significant change was achieved among 31.3-40.0% for guided self-help, compared with 24.0-36.0% for unguided self-help. Neither of the treatment conditions was found to be superior on any of the outcome measures, Fs(98, 65.17-72.55)&lt; 1.70, p &gt;.19. Internet-based CBT could be useful for managing self-reported difficulties due to procrastination, both with and without the guidance of a therapist.",1701612605, Feature,2015
Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) versus acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT) for dementia family caregivers with significant depressive symptoms: Results of a randomized clinical trial,"  The differential efficacy of acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT) and cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) for dementia family caregivers' is analyzed through a randomized controlled trial. Participants were 135 caregivers with high depressive symptomatology who were randomly allocated to the intervention conditions or a control group (CG). Pre-, postintervention, and follow-up measurements assessed depressive symptomatology, anxiety, leisure, dysfunctional thoughts, and experiential avoidance. Depression: Significant effects of interventions compared with CG were found for CBT (p &lt; .001, d = 0.98, number needed to treat [NNT] = 3.61) and ACT (p &lt; .001, d = 1.17, NNT = 3.53) at postintervention, but were maintained only at follow-up for CBT (p = .02, d = 0.74, NNT = 9.71). Clinically significant change was observed in 26.7% participants in CBT, 24.2% in ACT, and 0% in CG. At follow-up, 10.53% in CBT and 4% in ACT were recovered (0% CG). Anxiety: At postintervention, ACT participants showed lower anxiety than CBT participants (p &lt; .05, d = 0.50) and CG participants (p &lt; .01, d = 0.79, NNT = 3.86), with no effects at follow-up. At postintervention, 23.33% in CBT, 36.36% in ACT, and 6.45% in CG showed clinically significant change. At follow-up, 26.32% in CBT, 36% in ACT, and 13.64% in CG were recovered. Significant changes at postintervention were found in leisure and dysfunctional thoughts in both ACT and CBT, with changes in experiential avoidance only for ACT. Similar results were obtained for ACT and CBT. ACT seems to be a viable and effective treatment for dementia caregivers.",1701612481, Feature,2015
Toward a dynamic model of psychological assessment: Implications for personalized care,"  The present article proposes a general framework and a set of specific methodological steps for conducting person-specific dynamic assessments, which yield information about syndrome structures and states that can be used to provide actionable information for the formulation of personalized interventions. It is proposed that researchers should (a) determine the relevant constituent inputs for a diagnostic system; (b) measure these inputs with as much detail as possible; (c) assess the correlational structure of system inputs via factor-analytic methods within individuals; and (d) subject the individual-level, latent dimension time series to dynamic analyses such as the dynamic factor model (Molenaar, 1985) to discern the time-dependent, dynamic relationships within and between system components. An exemplar is provided wherein 10 individuals with clinically diagnosed generalized anxiety disorder completed surveys related to generalized anxiety disorder symptomatology for at least 60 consecutive days. These data were then subjected to person-specific exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses for the identification of latent symptom dimensions. Finally, dynamic factor models were used to model the dynamic interrelationships within and between symptom domains on a person-by-person basis. Person-specific factor analyses returned models with 3 (n = 8) or 4 (n = 2) latent factors, all with excellent fit. Dynamic factor modeling successfully revealed the contemporaneous correlations and time-lagged predictive relationships between factors, providing prescriptive information for the formulation of targeted interventions. The proposed approach has the potential to inform the construction and implementation of personalized treatments by delineating the idiosyncratic structure of psychopathology on a person-by-person basis.",1701611328, Feature,2015
Efficacy and moderators of a family group cognitive-behavioral preventive intervention for children of parents with depression,"  Building on an earlier study (Compas, Forehand, Thigpen, et al., 2011), tests of main effects and potential moderators of a family group cognitive-behavioral (FGCB) preventive intervention for children of parents with a history of depression are reported. Assessed a sample of 180 families (242 children ages 9-15 years) in a randomized controlled trial assessed at 2, 6, 12, 18 and 24 months after baseline. Significant effects favoring the FGCB intervention over a written information comparison condition were found on measures of children's symptoms of depression, mixed anxiety/depression, internalizing problems, and externalizing problems, with multiple effects maintained at 18 and 24 months, and on incidence of child episodes of major depressive disorder over the 24 months. Effects were stronger for child self-reports than for parent reports. Minimal evidence was found for child age, child gender, parental education, parental depressive symptoms, or presence of a current parental depressive episode at baseline as moderators of the FGCB intervention. The findings provide support for sustained and robust effects of this preventive intervention.",1687154681, Feature,2015
Motivational deficits differentially predict improvement in a randomized trial of self-system therapy for depression,"  A randomized trial compared the time course and differential predictors of symptom improvement in 2 treatments for depression. Forty-nine adults (84% female) who were not taking antidepressant medications and met diagnostic criteria for major depressive disorder or dysthymia were randomly assigned either to cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) or self-system therapy (SST), a treatment that targets problems in self-regulation, the ongoing process of evaluating progress toward personal goals. Self-regulatory variables (promotion and prevention focus and goal disengagement and reengagement) were assessed as potential moderators of efficacy. At intake, most participants reported depression in the moderate to severe range and had histories of recurrent episodes and previous treatment attempts. Self-reported symptoms of depression and anxiety were assessed at each therapy session. Multilevel modeling was used to examine (a) differences in change associated with the treatment conditions and (b) moderation of treatment efficacy by pretreatment measures of self-regulatory deficits. Both treatments were effective and did not show differences in the magnitude or rate of symptom change or in dropout rates, suggesting that CBT and SST were equally effective in improving depression and anxiety. Patients with self-regulatory deficits, however, showed greater improvement in depressive symptoms with SST. Specifically, patients with low promotion focus and low goal reengagement responded better to SST, whereas patients with high prevention focus responded better to CBT. Overall, the results corroborate previous research suggesting that SST is a viable short-term treatment for depression that is particularly effective in helping patients compensate for self-regulatory deficits.",1687154665, Feature,2015
Therapeutic alliance in a randomized clinical trial for bulimia nervosa,"  This study examined the temporal relation between therapeutic alliance and outcome in two treatments for bulimia nervosa (BN). Eighty adults with BN symptoms were randomized to 21 sessions of integrative cognitive-affective therapy (ICAT) or enhanced cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT-E). Bulimic symptoms (i.e., frequency of binge eating and purging) were assessed at each session and posttreatment. Therapeutic alliance (Working Alliance Inventory) was assessed at Sessions 2, 8, 14, and posttreatment. Repeated-measures analyses using linear mixed models with random intercepts were conducted to determine differences in alliance growth by treatment and patient characteristics. Mixed-effects models examined the relation between alliance and symptom improvement. Overall, patients in both treatments reported strong therapeutic alliances. Regardless of treatment, greater therapeutic alliance between (but not within) subjects predicted greater reductions in bulimic behavior; reductions in bulimic behavior also predicted improved alliance. Patients with higher depression, anxiety, or emotion dysregulation had a stronger therapeutic alliance in CBT-E than ICAT, while those with more intimacy problems had greater improvement in therapeutic alliance in ICAT compared to CBT-E. Therapeutic alliance has a unique impact on outcome, independent of the impact of symptom improvement on alliance. Within- and between-subjects effects revealed that changes in alliance over time did not predict symptom improvement, but rather that individuals who had a stronger alliance overall had better bulimic symptom outcomes. These findings indicate that therapeutic alliance is an important predictor of outcome in the treatment of BN.",1687154540, Feature,2015
Cbt for anxiety disorders in children with and without autism spectrum disorders,"  The effectiveness of cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) for anxiety disorders in children with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) was examined, and compared with children without ASD. Children with ASD and comorbid anxiety disorders (n = 79, 58 boys; Mage = 11.76) and children with anxiety disorders (n = 95, 46 boys; Mage = 12.85), and their parents, participated. All families were referred to 1 of 7 mental health care centers and received the same CBT. Anxiety, quality of life, ASD-like behaviors, and emotional-behavioral problems were measured at waitlist (ASD-group only, n = 17), pretest, posttest, and 3 months, 1 year, and 2 years after CBT. CBT was more effective than waitlist for treating anxiety disorders (d = -1.45) and anxiety symptoms (d = -0.48) in children with ASD. At 2 years follow-up, 61% of the children with and 64% without ASD were free of their primary anxiety disorder (percentages not significantly different). The decrease in severity of anxiety disorders after CBT (d values ranging between -1.05 and -1.46) was not different for children with and without ASD. Improvements were less in children with ASD for (only) 2 out of 7 continuous outcomes measures: anxiety symptoms (d values ranging between -0.68 and -0.94 vs. d values ranging between -0.98 and -1.25) and quality of life (d values ranging between 0.39 and 0.56 vs. d values ranging between 0.77 and 0.98). CBT for anxiety disorders is effective for children with ASD, also in the long-term. Treatment gains may be somewhat less compared with children without ASD.",1687154536, Feature,2015
Preliminary evaluation of a multimodal early intervention program for behaviorally inhibited preschoolers,"  Approximately 15%-20% of young children can be classified as having a behaviorally inhibited (BI) temperament. Stable BI predicts the development of later anxiety disorders (particularly social anxiety), but not all inhibited children develop anxiety. Parenting characterized by inappropriate warmth/sensitivity and/or intrusive control predicts the stability of BI and moderates risk for anxiety among high-BI children. For these reasons, we developed and examined the preliminary efficacy of the Turtle Program: a multimodal early intervention for inhibited preschool-age children. Forty inhibited children between the ages of 42-60 months and their parent(s) were randomized to either the Turtle Program (n = 18) or a waitlist control (WLC; n = 22) condition. Participants randomized to the Turtle Program condition received 8 weeks of concurrent parent and child group treatment. Participants were assessed at baseline and posttreatment with multisource assessments, including parent and teacher report measures of child anxiety, diagnostic interviews, and observations of parenting behavior. The Turtle Program resulted in significant beneficial effects relative to the WLC condition on maternal-reported anxiety symptoms of medium to large magnitude; large effects on parent-reported BI; medium to large effects on teacher-rated school anxiety symptoms; and medium effects on observed maternal positive affect/sensitivity. This study provides encouraging preliminary support for the Turtle Program for young behaviorally inhibited children. Effects of the Turtle Program generalized to the school setting. Future studies should examine whether this early intervention program improves long-term developmental outcomes for this at-risk group.",1687154386, Feature,2015
Self-harm and suicidal behavior in borderline personality disorder with and without bulimia nervosa,"  Few studies have investigated whether a diagnosis of Bulimia nervosa (BN) confers additional risk of life-threatening behaviors such as self-harm and suicidal behavior in borderline personality disorder (BPD). Participants were 483 treatment-seeking women diagnosed with BPD according to the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV Axis II Personality Disorders (SCID-II; First, Gibbon, Spitzer, Williams, &amp; Benjamin, 1997; Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th ed.; APA, 1994) and admitted to the Norwegian Network of Psychotherapeutic Day Hospitals between 1996 and 2009. Of these, 57 (11.8%) women met DSM-IV diagnostic criteria for BN according to the Mini-International Neuropsychiatric Interview (M.I.N.I.; Sheehan et al., 1998) and they were compared with women with BPD and other Axis I disorders. We found that comorbid BN is uniquely and significantly associated with increased risk of suicidal behavior among women being treated for BPD. Findings underscore the importance of routinely screening for BN among women seeking treatment for BPD, as co-occurring bulimia appears to be a significant marker for immediate life-threatening behaviors in this already high-risk population, which is a significant public health issue. A significantly greater proportion of women with BPD-BN reported suicidal ideation at intake (past 7 days), engaged in self-harm behavior during treatment, and attempted suicide during treatment. All bivariate associations remained significant in the logistic regression models after controlling for mood, anxiety, and substance-related disorders. The presence of a concurrent diagnosis of BN among women with BPD is significantly and uniquely associated with recent suicidal ideation, and self-harm behavior and suicide attempts during treatment after controlling for major classes of mental disorders. Co-occurring BN appears to represent a significant marker for immediate life-threatening behaviors in women seeking treatment for BPD. Extra vigilance and careful monitoring of suicidal behavior during treatment is important for these individuals, and routine screening for BN is warranted.",1687154375, Feature,2015
A diary-based modification of symptom attributions in pathological health anxiety: Effects on symptom report and cognitive biases,"  To examine whether a 2-week attribution modification training (AMT) changes symptom severity, emotional evaluation of health-threatening stimuli, and cognitive biases in pathological health anxiety. We randomized 85 patients with pathological health anxiety into an electronic diary-based AMT group (AMTG; n = 42) and a control group without AMT (CG; n = 43). Self-report symptom measures, emotional evaluation, attentional bias, and memory bias toward symptom and illness words were assessed with an emotional Stroop task, a recognition task, and an emotional rating task for valence and arousal. After the 2-week period, the AMTG compared with the CG reported lower symptoms of pathological health anxiety, F(1, 82) = 10.94, p&lt; .01, ... ... = .12, rated symptom, F(1, 82) = 5.56, p = .02, ... = .06, and illness words, F(1, 82) = 4.13, p = .045, ... = .05, as less arousing, and revealed a smaller memory response bias toward symptom words in the recognition task F(1, 82) = 12.32, p&lt; .01, ... ... = .13. However, no specific AMT effect was observed for the attentional bias. The results support the efficacy of a comparatively short cognitive intervention in pathological health anxiety as a possible add-on intervention to existing treatment approaches to reduce symptom severity, as well as abnormalities in health-related emotional evaluation and memory processes.

"Diagnoses, intervention strategies, and rates of functional improvement in integrated behavioral health care patients","  Compared with more traditional mental health care, integrated behavioral health care (IBHC) offers greater access to services and earlier identification and intervention of behavioral and mental health difficulties. The current study examined demographic, diagnostic, and intervention factors that predict positive changes for IBHC patients. Participants were 1,150 consecutive patients (mean age = 30.10 years, 66.6% female, 60.1% Hispanic, 47.9% uninsured) seen for IBHC services at 2 primary care clinics over a 34-month period. Patients presented with depressive (23.2%), anxiety (18.6%), adjustment (11.3%), and childhood externalizing (7.6%) disorders, with 25.7% of patients receiving no diagnosis. The most commonly delivered interventions included behavioral activation (26.1%), behavioral medicine-specific consultation (14.6%), relaxation training (10.3%), and parent-management training (8.5%). There was high concordance between diagnoses and evidence-based intervention selection. We used latent growth curve modeling to explore predictors of baseline global assessment of functioning (GAF) and improvements in GAF across sessions, utilizing data from a subset of 117 patients who attended at least 3 behavioral health visits. Hispanic ethnicity and being insured predicted higher baseline GAF, while patients with an anxiety disorder had lower baseline GAF than patients with other diagnoses. Controlling for primary diagnosis, patients receiving behavioral activation or exposure therapy improved at faster rates than patients receiving other interventions. Demographic variables did not relate to rates of improvement. Results suggest even brief IBHC interventions can be focused, targeting specific patient concerns with evidence-based treatment components.",1687154191, Feature,2015
Decentering as a potential common mechanism across two therapies for generalized anxiety disorder,"  The purpose of this study was to examine decentering as a potential mechanism of action across 2 treatments for generalized anxiety disorder: an acceptance-based behavioral therapy (ABBT) and applied relaxation (AR). Sixty-four individuals who completed at least half of the 16 total sessions of either ABBT or AR (65.6% female; 79.7% identified as White; average age = 34.41 years) completed measures of decentering (Experiences Questionnaire) and of symptoms of anxiety (Depression Anxiety Stress Scale-Stress subscale) at 5 time points over the course of therapy, and a measure of worry (Penn State Worry Questionnaire) at pre- and posttreatment. Initial growth curve models showed that decentering increased significantly over therapy (z = 7.09), and this increase was associated with a decrease in worry symptoms (Penn State Worry Questionnaire) at posttreatment (z = -8.51). The rate of change did not significantly vary across treatments, .../...df = 0.16/1, p = .69. Further, a series of bivariate latent difference score models indicated that the best-fitting model was one in which decentering was a leading indicator of change in symptoms (DASS-Stress). Allowing this coupling to vary across treatments did not significantly improve the fit of the model, .../..df = 0.71/1, p = .40. In this sample, results suggest that increased decentering was associated with decreases in anxiety and that changes in decentering appear to precede changes in symptoms within both ABBT and AR, indicating that decentering may be an important common mechanism of action.

Trajectories of change in youth anxiety during cognitive - behavior therapy,"  To evaluate changes in the trajectory of youth anxiety following the introduction of specific cognitive-behavior therapy (CBT) components: relaxation training, cognitive restructuring, and exposure tasks. Four hundred eighty-eight youths ages 7-17 years (50% female; 74% ≤ 12 years) were randomly assigned to receive either CBT, sertraline (SRT), their combination (COMB), or pill placebo (PBO) as part of their participation in the Child/Adolescent Anxiety Multimodal Study (CAMS). Youths in the CBT conditions were evaluated weekly by therapists using the Clinical Global Impression Scale-Severity (CGI-S; Guy, 1976) and the Children's Global Assessment Scale (CGAS; Shaffer et al., 1983) and every 4 weeks by blind independent evaluators (IEs) using the Pediatric Anxiety Ratings Scale (PARS; RUPP Anxiety Study Group, 2002). Youths in SRT and PBO were included as controls. Longitudinal discontinuity analyses indicated that the introduction of both cognitive restructuring (e.g., changing self-talk) and exposure tasks significantly accelerated the rate of progress on measures of symptom severity and global functioning moving forward in treatment; the introduction of relaxation training had limited impact. Counter to expectations, no strategy altered the rate of progress in the specific domain of anxiety that it was intended to target (i.e., somatic symptoms, anxious self-talk, avoidance behavior). Findings support CBT theory and suggest that cognitive restructuring and exposure tasks each make substantial contributions to improvement in youth anxiety. Implications for future research are discussed.",1670209508, Feature,2015
Behavior therapy for depressed breast cancer patients: Predictors of treatment outcome,"  Major depressive disorder (MDD) is the most common psychiatric disorder among breast cancer patients and is associated with substantial functional impairment. Although several outcome studies have explored the utility of psychotherapy for breast cancer patients with subsyndromal depression symptoms, only a few clinical trials have explored the efficacy of behavior therapy for patients with well-diagnosed MDD. An additional limitation of this research is that little is known about factors that best predict treatment outcome. In the context of a recent randomized trial of behavior activation and problem-solving therapy for depressed breast cancer patients (n = 80; Hopko et al., 2011), this study explored predictors of treatment outcome with selected demographic (age, education, marital status, occupational status), psychosocial (pretreatment depression and environmental reward, coexistent anxiety disorders, social support, history of psychotherapy) and cancer-related variables (cancer stage, duration of cancer diagnosis, and cancer treatment). Positive treatment outcome as defined by Beck Depression Inventory-II (Beck et al., 1996) response and remission criteria was associated with being married, increased social support, not actively undergoing cancer treatment during psychotherapy, and having a history of psychotherapy. The efficacy of behavior therapy for depressed breast cancer patients may depend on several patient variables. Implications for the provision of behavior therapy for breast cancer patients are discussed.",1655595031, Feature,2015
Parental psychopathology and treatment outcome for anxious youth: Roles of family functioning and caregiver strain,"  Research has examined the effects of parental psychopathology, family functioning, and caregiver strain on treatment response in anxious youths. Although these variables have shown individual links to youth treatment response, theoretical models for their combined effects remain unexplored. This study tested the hypothesis that improvements in family functioning and reductions in caregiver strain explained the effects of parental psychopathology on youth treatment outcome in an anxiety treatment trial. A multiple mediation technique was used to test the proposed model across independent evaluator (IE), parent, and youth informants in 488 youths, aged 7-17 years (50% female; mean age = 10.7) meeting Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders criteria for social phobia, separation anxiety, and/or generalized anxiety disorder. Youths were randomized to receive 12 weeks of cognitive-behavioral treatment (Coping Cat), medication (sertraline), their combination, or a pill placebo. At pre- and posttreatment, parents completed self-report measures of global psychopathology symptoms, family functioning, and caregiver strain; parents, youths, and IEs rated youths' anxiety symptom severity. Changes in family functioning and caregiver strain jointly explained relations between parental psychopathology and reductions in youth anxiety. Specifically, across IE and parent informants, families with higher pretreatment parental psychopathology showed more improvement in family functioning and caregiver strain, which in turn predicted greater youth anxiety reductions. Further, higher pretreatment parental psychopathology predicted greater caregiver strain reductions and, in turn, greater youth anxiety reductions, based on youths' reports of their own anxiety. Findings suggest that improvements in family functioning and reductions in caregiver strain can influence treatment outcomes for anxious youths, especially among youths with more distressed parents.",1655594987, Feature,2015
Existential therapies: A meta-analysis of their effects on psychological outcomes,"  To review the evidence on the efficacy of different types of existential therapies: a family of psychological interventions that draw on themes from existential philosophy to help clients address such issues in their lives as meaning and death anxiety. Relevant electronic databases, journals, and reference lists were searched for eligible studies. Effects on meaning, psychopathology (anxiety and depression), self-efficacy, and physical well-being were extracted from each publication or obtained directly from its authors. All types of existential therapy for adult samples were included. Weighted pooled mean effects were calculated and analyses performed assuming fixed-effects model. Twenty-one eligible randomized controlled trials of existential therapy were found, from which 15 studies with unique data were included, comprising a total of 1,792 participants. Meaning therapies (n = 6 studies) showed large effects on positive meaning in life immediately postintervention (d = 0.65) and at follow-up (d = 0.57), and had moderate effects on psychopathology (d = 0.47) and self-efficacy (d = 0.48) at postintervention; they did not have significant effects on self-reported physical well-being (n = 1 study). Supportive-expressive therapy (n = 5) had small effects at posttreatment and follow-up on psychopathology (d = 0.20, 0.18, respectively); effects on self-efficacy and self-reported physical well-being were not significant (n = 1 and n = 4, respectively). Experiential-existential (n = 2) and cognitive-existential therapies (n = 1) had no significant effects. Despite the small number and low quality of studies, some existential therapies appear beneficial for certain populations. We found particular support for structured interventions incorporating psychoeducation, exercises, and discussing meaning in life directly and positively with physically ill patients. It is important to study more precisely which existential intervention works the best for which individual client.",1655594976, Feature,2015
The Enhancing Connections Program: A six-state randomized clinical trial of a cancer parenting program,"  The purpose of this study was to test the efficacy of a cancer parenting program for child rearing mothers with breast cancer, the Enhancing Connections Program. Primary goals were to decrease maternal depressed mood and anxiety, improve parenting quality, parenting skills and confidence, and enhance the child's behavioral-emotional adjustment to maternal breast cancer. A total of 176 mothers diagnosed within 6 months with Stage 0 to Stage III breast cancer and their 8- to 12-year-old child were recruited from medical providers in 6 states: Washington, California, Pennsylvania, Minnesota, Arizona, and Indiana. After consenting and obtaining baseline measures, study participants were randomized into experimental or control groups. Experimental mothers received 5, 1-hr educational counseling sessions at 2-week intervals; controls received a booklet and phone call on communicating and supporting their child about the mother's cancer. Outcomes were assessed at 2 and 12 months. Compared to controls, at 2 months experimental mothers significantly improved on depressed mood and parenting skills; experimental children improved on behavioral-emotional adjustment: total behavior problems, externalizing problems, and anxiety/depressed mood significantly declined. At 1 year, experimental children remained significantly less depressed than controls on both mother- and child-reported measures. The intervention failed to significantly affect parenting self-efficacy or maternal anxiety. The Enhancing Connections Program benefitted mothers and children in specific areas and warrants refinement and further testing.",1655594925, Feature,2015
Comorbidity effects on cocaine dependence treatment and examination of reciprocal relationships between abstinence and depression,"  We examined comorbid disorders' prevalence, their impact on abstinence, and the impact of depressive symptoms on abstinence and of abstinence on depressive symptoms. A randomized controlled trial's data on outcomes from treating cocaine dependence were used. It compared abstinence-contingent housing and work to contingency management plus behavioral day treatment. Regardless of original trial arm assignment, groups of participants with no additional Axis I disorders (n = 87) and 1 or more additional Axis I disorders (n = 113) were compared for abstinence. Changes in depression symptoms, measured by the Beck Depression Inventory, were analyzed as a function of 4 cohorts of increased consecutive weeks abstinent. An autoregressive cross-lagged path model examined reciprocal relationships between depression and abstinence. Most prevalent additional disorders were depressive disorders, followed by anxiety disorders. Additional disorders did not significantly affect abstinence. Cohorts with more abstinence were linearly related to lower depression symptoms. The cross-lagged model showed that longer abstinence predicted decreases in depressive symptoms at 6 months. However, depressive symptoms did not predict changes in abstinence. Our study adds to others that have found an effective treatment targeted at specific problems such as substance abuse, social anxiety disorder, and posttraumatic stress disorder that may have the side benefit of reducing depression. Additionally, we find that depression does not interfere with effective substance abuse treatment for cocaine dependency. This may be the 1st formal analysis comparing the ability of cocaine abstinence to predict future depressive symptoms versus depressive symptoms to predict future cocaine abstinence.",1655594888, Feature,2015
Randomized clinical trial evaluating the efficacy of a brief intervention targeting anxiety sensitivity cognitive concerns,"  Anxiety sensitivity (AS) is a well-established, malleable risk factor for anxiety and other forms of psychopathology. Structural evaluation models of AS suggest it can be decomposed into physical, social, and cognitive concerns, and emerging work indicates that these components may be differentially related to various adverse outcomes. In particular, AS cognitive concerns have been consistently linked with suicide. Prior work has also shown that brief interventions can effectively reduce overall AS, but these treatments tend to focus on its physical subcomponent. The aim of the current investigation was to design and evaluate the efficacy of an AS treatment more specifically focused on its cognitive component. Non-treatment-seeking participants (N = 108) with elevated AS were randomly assigned to a 1-session intervention utilizing psychoeducation and interoceptive exposure techniques to target AS or a health information control intervention and assessed posttreatment and at 1-month follow-up. The active treatment condition produced significantly greater reductions in AS at posttreatment. Group differences persisted at 1-month follow-up that were specific to AS cognitive concerns. Moreover, changes in cognitive AS mediated symptom change at follow-up including suicide outcomes. Despite the brevity of the treatment intervention, findings demonstrate that it resulted in substantial reductions in AS cognitive concerns that were linked with symptom improvement.",1639875325, Feature,2014
Resilience in the initial year of caregiving for a family member with a traumatic spinal cord injury,"  Individuals who assume caregiving duties for a family member disabled in a traumatic injury often exhibit considerable distress, yet few studies have examined characteristics of those who may be resilient in the initial year of caregiving. Reasoning from the influential Pearlin model of caregiving (Pearlin &amp; Aneshensel, 1994) and the resilience process model (Bonanno, 2005), we expected a significant minority of caregivers would be chronically distressed and another group would be resilient throughout the inaugural year of caregiving for a person with a traumatic spinal cord injury (SCI), and these groups would differ significantly in primary and secondary stress and in personal resources and mediators. Twenty men and 108 women who identified as caregivers for a family member who incurred a traumatic SCI consented to complete measures during the inpatient rehabilitation and at 1 month, 6 months, and 12 months postdischarge. Latent growth mixture modeling of depression symptoms over time revealed 3 groups of caregivers: chronic (24%), recovery (24%) and resilient (48%). The chronic group reported more anxiety, negative affect, and ill health than the other 2 groups throughout the year. The resilient group was best characterized by their enduring levels of positive affect and supportive social networks. A large percentage of individuals are resilient in the initial year of caregiving, and those who have problems adapting exhibit significant distress soon following the traumatic event. Early detection of and psychological interventions for individuals who have difficulty adjusting are indicated, as their distress is unlikely to abate untreated over the year.",1639875321, Feature,2014
Telephone-delivered cognitive behavioral therapy for high anxiety sensitivity: A randomized controlled trial,"  High anxiety sensitivity (AS) is associated with the development and maintenance of anxiety and depressive symptoms and is theorized to be a mediator of treatment outcomes for anxiety and depression. The present study tested the efficacy of a telephone-delivered cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) intervention in reducing high AS and its associated anxiety and depressive symptoms. Treatment-seeking participants with high AS were recruited from the community (N = 80; M age = 36 years; 79% women; 76% Caucasian) and were randomly assigned to an 8-week telephone-delivered CBT program or a waiting list control. Participants completed anxiety and depression symptom and diagnostic measures at pre- and posttreatment, after a subsequent 4 weeks of continued interoceptive exposure, and 8 weeks later. Multilevel modeling showed the treatment was successful in reducing AS, as well as panic, social phobia, posttraumatic stress symptoms, and number of Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (4th ed.; American Psychiatric Association, 1994) diagnoses per participant when compared to a waiting list control. These gains were maintained at follow-up. Generalized anxiety and depressive symptoms, however, did not improve as a result of treatment. Mediated moderation analyses suggested that treatment-related changes in AS may mediate anxiety symptom changes. Results of the present study provide promising evidence for this transdiagnostic treatment approach. Reductions in anxiety symptoms across diagnostic categories stemming from this AS-targeted intervention may have implications for helping a broad array of clients with various anxiety disorders that share AS as a common risk or maintenance factor.",1639874830, Feature,2014
Types of parental involvement in CBT with anxious youth: A preliminary meta-analysis,"  Meta-analytic studies have not confirmed that involving parents in cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) for anxious children is therapeutically beneficial. There is also great heterogeneity in the type of parental involvement included. We investigated parental involvement focused on contingency management (CM) and transfer of control (TC) as a potential outcome moderator using a meta-analysis with individual patient data. Investigators of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of CBT for anxious children, identified systematically, were invited to submit their data. Conditions in each RCT were coded based on type of parental involvement in CBT (i.e., low involvement, active involvement without emphasis on CM or TC, active involvement with emphasis on CM or TC). Treatment outcomes were compared using a 1-stage meta-analysis. All cases involved in active treatment (894 of 1,618) were included for subgroup analyses. Across all CBT groups, means of clinical severity, anxiety, and internalizing symptoms significantly decreased posttreatment and were comparable across groups. The group without emphasis on CM or TC showed a higher proportion with posttreatment anxiety diagnoses than the low-involvement group. Between posttreatment and 1-year follow-up, the proportion with anxiety diagnoses significantly decreased in CBT with active parental involvement with emphasis on CM or TC, whereas treatment gains were merely maintained in the other 2 groups. CBT for anxious children is an effective treatment with or without active parental involvement. However, CBT with active parental involvement emphasizing CM or TC may support long-term maintenance of treatment gains. Results should be replicated as additional RCTs are published.",1639874818, Feature,2014
A randomized controlled trial evaluating a brief parenting program with children with autism spectrum disorders,"  This randomized controlled trial evaluated the efficacy of Primary Care Stepping Stones Triple P, a brief individualized parenting program, in a sample of parents of children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Sixty-four parents of children aged 2-9 years (M = 5.67, SD = 2.14) with an ASD diagnosis participated in the study. Eighty-six percent of children were male, and 89% of parents identified their child's ethnicity as Australian/White. Families were randomly assigned to 1 of 2 conditions (intervention or care-as-usual) and were assessed at 3 time points (preintervention, postintervention, and 6-month follow-up). Parents completed a range of questionnaires to assess changes in child behavior (Eyberg Child Behavior Inventory) and parent outcomes (Parenting Scale, Depression Anxiety Stress Scale-21, Parent Problem Checklist, Relationship Quality Inventory, Parental Stress Scale) and 30-min home observations of parent-child interactions. Relative to the care-as-usual group, significant short-term improvements were found in the intervention group on parent-reported child behavior problems, dysfunctional parenting styles, parenting confidence, and parental stress, parental conflict, and relationship happiness. No significant intervention effects were found on levels of parental depression or anxiety, or on observed child disruptive and parent aversive behavior. The effect sizes for significant variables ranged from medium to large. Short-term effects were predominantly maintained at 6-month follow-up, and parents reported high levels of goal achievement and satisfaction with the program. The results indicate that a brief low intensity version of Stepping Stones Triple P is an efficacious intervention for parents of children with ASD.",1639874710, Feature,2014
Test of mindfulness and hope components in a psychological intervention for women with cancer recurrence,"  Psychological interventions can attenuate distress and enhance coping for those with an initial diagnosis of cancer, but there are few intervention options for individuals with cancer recurrence. To address this gap, we developed and tested a novel treatment combining Mindfulness, Hope Therapy, and biobehavioral components. Method: An uncontrolled, repeated measures design was used. Women (N = 32) with recurrent breast or gynecologic cancers were provided 20 treatment sessions in individual (n = 12) or group (n = 20) formats. On average, participants were middle aged (M = 58) and Caucasian (81%). Independent variables (i.e., hope and mindfulness) and psychological outcomes (i.e., depression, negative mood, worry, and symptoms of generalized anxiety disorder) were assessed pre-treatment and 2, 4, and 7 months later. Session-by-session therapy process (positive and negative affect, quality-of-life) and mechanism (use of intervention-specific skills) measures were also included. Results: Distress, anxiety, and negative affect decreased, whereas positive affect and mental-health-related quality-of-life increased over the course of treatment, as demonstrated in mixed-effects models with the intent-to-treat sample. Both hope and mindfulness increased, and use of mindfulness skills was related to decreased anxiety. Conclusions: This treatment was feasible to deliver and was acceptable to patients. The trial serves as preliminary evidence for a multi-component intervention tailored to treat difficulties specific to recurrent cancer. The blending of the components was novel as well as theoretically and practically consistent. A gap in the literature is addressed, providing directions for testing interventions designed for patients coping with the continuing stressors and challenges of cancer recurrence.",1639874666, Feature,2014
"Two-year course of generalized anxiety disorder, social anxiety disorder, and panic disorder with agoraphobia in a sample of Latino adults","  It is imperative to study the clinical course of anxiety disorders among Latinos, given the implications for culturally sensitive treatment in this population. The current study is the first prospective, observational, longitudinal study of anxiety disorders among Latinos. Data are reported on 139 adult Latinos (M age = 34.65 years, SD = 10.98, 70.5% female) diagnosed with social anxiety disorder (SAD; n = 86), generalized anxiety disorder (GAD; n = 90), or panic disorder with agoraphobia (PDA; n = 62). The participants were interviewed with standardized clinical interviews at intake and annually over 2 years of follow-up. Probabilities of recovery were calculated using standard survival analysis methods. The 2-year recovery rates in this study were 0.07 for SAD, 0.14 for GAD, 0.03 for PDA, and 0.50 for major depressive disorder (MDD). Overall functioning, social adjustment, and life satisfaction in this sample were poor. The recovery rates for anxiety disorders in this Latino sample were markedly low. Although caution must be used in comparing these data with prior longitudinal studies, these recovery rates seem to be much lower than in non-Latino White samples. However, the clinical course of MDD in this sample was similar to its course among non-Latino Whites, invoking the pressing question of whether there is something about the experience of anxiety disorders (but not MDD) among Latinos that makes them more impairing and persistent. The answer to that question should inform future treatment development for this population.",1639874653, Feature,2014
An idiographic analysis of change processes in the unified transdiagnostic treatment of depression,"  Idiographic research methods can provide rich information regarding the process of change in specific treatments. Objective: Adopting an idiographic, exploratory approach, this study examined (a) temporal patterns of 3 transdiagnostic change constructs (mindfulness, cognitive reappraisal, and emotion avoidance), (b) the relationships between these constructs and depression and anxiety symptom severity over time, and (c) changes in these constructs in relation to the introduction of specific transdiagnostic intervention strategies in a single case. Method: The case was a 64-year-old, White, female patient with principal major depressive disorder and secondary generalized anxiety disorder being treated with the Unified Protocol (UP). Univariate and multivariate time series analyses were applied to symptom and change construct data. Results: (a) Clinically significant decreases in depression and anxiety from baseline to posttreatment were observed, as well as clinically significant increases in mindfulness and reappraisal; (b) changes in mindfulness were associated with changes in depression and anxiety, and changes in mindfulness temporally preceded changes in depression and anxiety; (c) changes in reappraisal were associated with changes in depression, and changes in reappraisal temporally preceded changes in depression; (d) the UP module designed to increase present-focused emotion awareness exerted the strongest influence on mindfulness ratings, although other modules had an impact; (e) reappraisal ratings were most strongly influenced by the emotion monitoring and functional analysis module, although subsequent modules continued to have a measureable impact. Conclusions: Although specific to this case, these results begin to elucidate important processes of change in transdiagnostic cognitive-behavioral therapy for principal depression with comorbid anxiety.",1639871410, Feature,2014
Treating co-occurring depression and anxiety: Modeling the dynamics of psychopathology and psychotherapy using the time-varying effect model,"  We demonstrate the utility of the time-varying effect model (TVEM) for the analysis of psychotherapy data, with the aim of elucidating complex patterns of change over time and dynamic associations between constructs of interest. Specifically, we examine the association between depression and co-occurring anxiety in a sample of adults treated with interpersonal psychotherapy (IPT) for depression or a variant designed to address both depression and co-occurring anxiety (IPT-PS, IPT for depression with panic and anxiety symptoms). Seventy-eight (82% female) adult outpatients with major depression and co-occurring anxiety were assessed at each of 16 outpatient treatment sessions using the Hamilton rating scales for depression and anxiety. On average, depressive symptoms declined in a quadratic form over the course of treatment. While the association between anxiety and depression was modest early in treatment, it strengthened over the middle and latter treatment phases. Finally, exploratory analyses suggest that while IPT and IPT-PS were similarly effective in reducing depressive symptoms, IPT-PS may be more effective at uncoupling the association between core anxiety and depressive symptoms. Findings point to the utility of the TVEM for psychotherapy research and the importance of assessing anxiety in the course of treating depression, especially following the initial phase of treatment (i.e., after Session 5).",1567145647, Feature,2014
Benchmarking outcomes in a public behavioral health setting: Feedback as a quality improvement strategy,"  The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of a large public behavioral health (PBH) agency serving only clients at or below the federal poverty level that had implemented continuous outcome feedback as a quality improvement strategy. The authors investigated the post treatment outcomes of 5,168 individuals seeking treatment for a broad range of diagnoses who completed at least 2 psychotherapy sessions. The Outcome Rating Scale (ORS; Duncan, 2011; Miller &amp; Duncan, 2004) was used to measure outcomes. Clients had a mean age of 36.7 years and were predominantly female (60.7%) and White (67.8%), with 17.7% being Hispanic, 9.3% being African American, and 2.8% being Native American. Forty-six percent were diagnosed with depression, mood, and anxiety disorders; 18.8% were diagnosed with substance abuse disorders; and 14.4% were diagnosed with bipolar disorder and schizophrenia. A subset of clients with a primary diagnosis of a depressive disorder was compared to treatment efficacy benchmarks derived from clinical trials of major depression. Given that the PBH agency had also implemented an outcome management system, the total sample was also compared to benchmarks derived from clinical trials of continuous outcome feedback. Treatment effect sizes of psychotherapy delivered at the PBH agency were comparable to effect size estimates of clinical trials of depression and feedback. Observed effect sizes were smaller, however, when compared to feedback benchmarks that used the ORS. Services to the poor and disabled can be effective, and continuous outcome feedback may be a viable means both to improve outcomes and to narrow the gap between research and practice.",1553179989, Feature,2014
PTSD diagnostic validity in Veterans Affairs electronic records of Iraq and Afghanistan veterans,"  Administrative planning and policy decisions frequently rely on diagnostic data extracted from large electronic databases. However, the accuracy of this diagnostic information is uncertain. The present study examined the degree to which various diagnoses of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) within Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) electronic databases were concordant with PTSD diagnostic status determined by standardized diagnostic interview. We interviewed 1,649 veterans of the Iraq and Afghanistan wars using the PTSD Module of the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV (SCID). Participants also completed other interview-based and self-report measures of psychopathology and provided consent to access their electronic medical records (EMRs). Concordance between database diagnosis and SCID diagnosis was 72.3% for current PTSD and 79.4% for lifetime PTSD. We observed associations between concordance status and combat exposure, PTSD symptom presentation, comorbid anxiety and depression, and psychosocial impairment. Veterans with false-negative PTSD diagnoses in the EMR were more likely to report lower levels of combat exposure, panic, and PTSD avoidance symptoms. Veterans with false-positive PTSD diagnoses in the EMR were more likely to report treatment seeking for emotional problems and less overall functional impairment. Although the majority of participants were concordant for PTSD status, over 25% of EMR diagnoses differed from those obtained in the diagnostic interview, with varying proportions of false positives and false negatives. Overall, those individuals with the most and least severe symptom presentations in the diagnostic interview were more likely to be accurately classified.",1553179877, Feature,2014
Long-term effects of analysis of the patient-therapist relationship in the context of patients' personality pathology and therapists' parental feelings,"Analysis of the patient-therapist relationship (relationship work) is considered a core active ingredient in dynamic psychotherapy. However, there are contradictory findings as for whom and under what circumstances these interventions are beneficial. This study investigates long-term effects of relationship work in the context of patients' level of personality pathology and therapists' self-reported parental feelings. One hundred outpatients seeking psychotherapy for depression, anxiety, and personality disorders were randomly assigned to weekly dynamic psychotherapy, either with or without relationship work, for 1 year. Personality pathology was evaluated before treatment as the sum of fulfilled personality disorder criteria items on the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-III-R Personality Disorders. Therapist feelings were assessed using the Feeling Word Checklist-58. The outcome variables were the Psychodynamic Functioning Scales and Inventory of Interpersonal Problems, measured at pretreatment, midtreatment, posttreatment, 1 year, and 3 years after treatment termination. A significant interaction of treatment group (relationship work vs. no relationship work) by personality pathology by parental therapist feelings was present, indicating that parental feelings were differentially associated with long-term effects of relationship work, depending on the level of personality pathology. In the context of low parental feelings, relationship work was positive for all patients. However, when parental feelings were stronger, the specific effects of such interventions were even more positive for patients with high levels of personality pathology, but negative for patients with low levels of personality pathology. The interaction of parental therapist feelings and patients' personality pathology was strongly associated with the long-term specific effects of analysis of the patient-therapist relationship.

Effect of cognitive-behavioral therapy for anxiety disorders on quality of life: A meta-analysis,"Although cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) is effective for treating anxiety disorders, little is known about its effect on quality of life. To conduct a meta-analysis of CBT for anxiety disorders on quality of life, we searched for relevant studies in PubMed, PsycINFO, and the Cochrane Library and conducted manual searches. The search identified 44 studies that included 59 CBT trials, totaling 3,326 participants receiving CBT for anxiety disorders. We estimated the controlled and within-group random effects of the treatment changes on quality of life. The pre-post within-group and controlled effect sizes were moderately strong (Hedges's g = 0.54 and Hedges's g = 0.56, respectively). Improvements were greater for physical and psychological domains of quality of life than for environmental and social domains. The overall effect sizes decreased with publication year and increased with treatment duration. Face-to-face treatments delivered individually and in groups produced significantly higher effect sizes than Internet-delivered treatments. CBT for anxiety disorders is moderately effective for improving quality of life, especially in physical and psychological domains. Internet-delivered treatments are less effective than face-to-face treatments in improving quality of life. [Copyright American Psychological Association]",1550984971, Journal Article,2014
Reaching new heights: Comparing interpretation bias modification to exposure therapy for extreme height fear,"Cognitive models of anxiety disorders posit that biases in interpretation maintain, and potentially cause, anxiety. This study tested whether it is possible to decrease height fear symptoms through cognitive bias modification for interpretations (CBM-I). Additionally, the clinical utility of CBM-I was tested by comparing it to an already established treatment: exposure therapy. Extremely height fearful individuals (N = 110) participated in the study. Acrophobic symptoms were measured before and after 2 sessions of CBM-I and were compared to the standard treatment for acrophobia (exposure therapy), a combination of CBM-I and exposure therapy, and a Control condition. In line with hypotheses, participants in the 3 active conditions showed greater response to treatment than the Control condition in height-relevant interpretation bias, symptoms, and behavioral avoidance on a height stressor, with few differences between the active conditions. Further, symptom change was mediated by change in interpretation bias. Overall, findings suggest that different pathways to fear reduction (exposure vs. shifting interpretations) can lead to similar reductions in height fear. This study provides the first evidence that directly shifting cognitive processing, even with no therapist involvement, can reduce symptoms as effectively as the gold standard, therapist-directed exposure therapy.

Treatment engagement and response to CBT among Latinos with anxiety disorders in primary care,"In the current study, we compared measures of treatment outcome and engagement for Latino and non-Latino White patients receiving a cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) program delivered in primary care. Participants were 18-65 years old and recruited from 17 clinics at 4 different sites to participate in a randomized controlled trial for anxiety disorders, which compared the Coordinated Anxiety Learning and Management (CALM) intervention (consisting of CBT, medication, or both) with usual care. Of those participants who were randomized to the intervention arm and selected CBT (either alone or in combination with medication), 85 were Latino and 251 were non-Latino White; the majority of the Latino participants received the CBT intervention in English (n = 77). Blinded assessments of clinical improvement and functioning were administered at baseline and at 6, 12, and 18 months after baseline. Measures of engagement, including attendance, homework adherence, understanding of CBT principles, and commitment to treatment, were assessed weekly during the CBT intervention. Findings from propensity-weighted linear and logistic regression models revealed no statistically significant differences between Latinos and non-Latino Whites on symptom measures of clinical improvement and functioning at almost all time points. There were significant differences on 2 of 7 engagement outcomes, namely, number of sessions attended and patients' understanding of CBT principles. These findings suggest that CBT can be an effective treatment approach for Latinos who are primarily English speaking and likely more acculturated, although continued attention should be directed toward engaging Latinos in such interventions.

Reaching new heights: Comparing interpretation bias modification to exposure therapy for extreme height fear,"  Cognitive models of anxiety disorders posit that biases in interpretation maintain, and potentially cause, anxiety. This study tested whether it is possible to decrease height fear symptoms through cognitive bias modification for interpretations (CBM-I). Additionally, the clinical utility of CBM-I was tested by comparing it to an already established treatment: exposure therapy. Extremely height fearful individuals (N = 110) participated in the study. Acrophobic symptoms were measured before and after 2 sessions of CBM-I and were compared to the standard treatment for acrophobia (exposure therapy), a combination of CBM-I and exposure therapy, and a Control condition. In line with hypotheses, participants in the 3 active conditions showed greater response to treatment than the Control condition in height-relevant interpretation bias, symptoms, and behavioral avoidance on a height stressor, with few differences between the active conditions. Further, symptom change was mediated by change in interpretation bias. Overall, findings suggest that different pathways to fear reduction (exposure vs. shifting interpretations) can lead to similar reductions in height fear.

Long-term effects of analysis of the patient-therapist relationship in the context of patients' personality pathology and therapists' parental feelings,"  Analysis of the patient-therapist relationship (relationship work) is considered a core active ingredient in dynamic psychotherapy. However, there are contradictory findings as for whom and under what circumstances these interventions are beneficial. This study investigates long-term effects of relationship work in the context of patients' level of personality pathology and therapists' self-reported parental feelings. One hundred outpatients seeking psychotherapy for depression, anxiety, and personality disorders were randomly assigned to weekly dynamic psychotherapy, either with or without relationship work, for 1 year. Personality pathology was evaluated before treatment as the sum of fulfilled personality disorder criteria items on the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-III-R Personality Disorders. Therapist feelings were assessed using the Feeling Word Checklist-58. The outcome variables were the Psychodynamic Functioning Scales and Inventory of Interpersonal Problems, measured at pretreatment, midtreatment, posttreatment, 1 year, and 3 years after treatment termination. A significant interaction of treatment group (relationship work vs. no relationship work) by personality pathology by parental therapist feelings was present, indicating that parental feelings were differentially associated with long-term effects of relationship work, depending on the level of personality pathology. In the context of low parental feelings, relationship work was positive for all patients. However, when parental feelings were stronger, the specific effects of such interventions were even more positive for patients with high levels of personality pathology, but negative for patients with low levels of personality pathology. The interaction of parental therapist feelings and patients' personality pathology was strongly associated with the long-term specific effects of analysis of the patient-therapist relationship.",1532769177, Feature,2014
Effect of cognitive-behavioral therapy for anxiety disorders on quality of life: A meta-analysis,"  Although cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) is effective for treating anxiety disorders, little is known about its effect on quality of life. To conduct a meta-analysis of CBT for anxiety disorders on quality of life, we searched for relevant studies in PubMed, PsycINFO, and the Cochrane Library and conducted manual searches. The search identified 44 studies that included 59 CBT trials, totaling 3,326 participants receiving CBT for anxiety disorders. We estimated the controlled and within-group random effects of the treatment changes on quality of life. The pre-post within-group and controlled effect sizes were moderately strong (Hedges's g = 0.54 and Hedges's g = 0.56, respectively). Improvements were greater for physical and psychological domains of quality of life than for environmental and social domains. The overall effect sizes decreased with publication year and increased with treatment duration. Face-to-face treatments delivered individually and in groups produced significantly higher effect sizes than Internet-delivered treatments. CBT for anxiety disorders is moderately effective for improving quality of life, especially in physical and psychological domains. Internet-delivered treatments are less effective than face-to-face treatments in improving quality of life.",1532769143, Feature,2014
Predictors and moderators of treatment response in childhood anxiety disorders: Results from the CAMS trial,"We sought to examine predictors and moderators of treatment outcomes among 488 youths ages 7-17 years (50% female; 74% <= 12 years) meeting Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (4th ed., text rev.; American Psychiatric Association, 2000) criteria for diagnoses of separation anxiety disorder, social phobia, or generalized anxiety disorder who were randomly assigned to receive either cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), sertraline (SRT), their combination (COMB), or medication management with pill placebo (PBO) in the Child/Adolescent Anxiety Multimodal Study (CAMS). Six classes of predictor and moderator variables (22 variables) were identified from the literature and examined using continuous (Pediatric Anxiety Ratings Scale; PARS) and categorical (Clinical Global Impression Scale-Improvement; CGI-I) outcome measures. Three baseline variables predicted better outcomes (independent of treatment condition) on the PARS, including low anxiety severity (as measured by parents and independent evaluators) and caregiver strain. No baseline variables were found to predict Week 12 responder status (CGI-I). Participants' principal diagnosis moderated treatment outcomes but only on the PARS. No baseline variables were found to moderate treatment outcomes on Week 12 responder status (CGI-I). Overall, anxious children responded favorably to CAMS treatments. However, having more severe and impairing anxiety, greater caregiver strain, and a principal diagnosis of social phobia were associated with less favorable outcomes.

Patterns of early change and their relationship to outcome and early treatment termination in patients with panic disorder,"Recently, innovative statistical tools have been used to model patterns of change in psychological treatments. These tools can detect patterns of change in patient progress early in treatment and allow for the prediction of treatment outcomes and treatment length. We used growth mixture modeling to identify different latent classes of early change in patients with panic disorder (N = 326) who underwent a manualized cognitive-behavioral treatment. Four latent subgroups were identified, showing clusters of change trajectories over the first 5 sessions. One of the subgroups consisted of patients whose symptoms rapidly decreased and also showed the best outcomes. This information improved treatment prediction by 16.1% over patient intake characteristics. Early change patterns also significantly predicted patients' early treatment termination. Patient intake characteristics that significantly predicted class membership included functional impairment and separation anxiety. These findings suggest that early treatment changes are uniquely predictive of treatment outcome. [Copyright American Psychological Association]",1531919562, Journal Article,2014

The UK Resilience Programme: A school-based universal nonrandomized pragmatic controlled trial,"The study aimed to assess the effectiveness of an 18-hr cognitive behavioral group intervention in reducing depressive symptoms (and associated outcomes) in a universal sample of students in mainstream schools in England. The intervention, the UK Resilience Programme (UKRP), was based on the Penn Resiliency Program for Children and Adolescents. Students (N = 2,844; 49% female; 67% White) were ages 11-12 at 16 schools. Classes of students were assigned arbitrarily into intervention (UKRP) or control (usual school provision) conditions based on class timetables. Outcome measures were the Children's Depression Inventory (Kovacs, 1992) (depressive symptoms, primary outcome); Revised Children's Manifest Anxiety Scale (C. R. Reynolds & Richmond, 1985) (anxiety); and child-reported Goodman (1997) Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (behavior). Students were surveyed at baseline, postintervention, 1-year follow-up, and 2-year follow-up. At postintervention, UKRP students reported lower levels of depressive symptoms than control group students, but the effect was small (d = 0.093, 95% CI [-0.178, -0.007], p = .034) and did not persist to 1-year or 2-year follow-ups. There was no significant impact on symptoms of anxiety or behavior at any point. UKRP produced small, short-term impacts on depression symptoms and did not reduce anxiety or behavioral problems. These findings suggest that interventions may produce reduced impacts when rolled out and taught by regular school staff. We discuss the implications of these findings for policy and for future dissemination efforts. [Copyright American Psychological Association]",1512194290, Journal Article,2014
The efficacy of an opportunistic cognitive behavioral intervention package (OCB) on substance use and comorbid suicide risk: A multisite randomized controlled trial,"People with substance use disorders who present with suicidal behavior are at high risk of subsequent suicide. There are few effective treatments specifically tailored for this population that diminish this risk. We aimed to assess the impact of an opportunistic cognitive behavioral intervention package (OCB) among adult outpatients with a substance use and comorbid suicide risk. A randomized controlled trial was conducted across 2 sites in which 185 patients presenting with suicide risk and concurrent substance use received either OCB (8 sessions plus group therapy) or treatment as usual (TAU) over a 6-month period. Primary outcomes were suicidal behavior (suicide attempts, suicidal intent and presence of suicide ideation) and level of drug and alcohol consumption. Secondary outcomes were changes in psychological measures of suicide ideation, depression, anxiety, and self-efficacy. There were no completed suicides, and only 2 participants reported suicide attempts at follow-up. Suicide ideation, alcohol consumption, and cannabis use fell over time but no significant Treatment x Time differences were found. There were also no differences between OCB and TAU over time on psychological measures of depression, anxiety, or self-efficacy. Suicide ideation at 6-month follow-up was predicted by cannabis use and higher scores on the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale at baseline. The opportunistic cognitive behavioral intervention package did not appear to be beneficial in reducing suicide ideation, drug and alcohol consumption, or depression relative to treatment as usual.

Timing matters: Change depends on the stage of treatment in cognitive behavioral therapy for panic disorder with agoraphobia,"The mechanisms of action underlying treatment are inadequately understood. This study examined 5 variables implicated in the treatment of panic disorder with agoraphobia (PD/AG): catastrophic agoraphobic cognitions, anxiety about bodily sensations, agoraphobic avoidance, anxiety sensitivity, and psychological flexibility. The relative importance of these process variables was examined across treatment phases: (a) psychoeducation/interoceptive exposure, (b) in situ exposure, and (c) generalization/follow-up. Data came from a randomized controlled trial of cognitive behavioral therapy for PD/AG (n = 301). Outcomes were the Panic and Agoraphobia Scale (Bandelow, 1995) and functioning as measured in the Clinical Global Impression scale (Guy, 1976). The effect of process variables on subsequent change in outcome variables was calculated using bivariate latent difference score modeling. Change in panic symptomatology was preceded by catastrophic appraisal and agoraphobic avoidance across all phases of treatment, by anxiety sensitivity during generalization/follow-up, and by psychological flexibility during exposure in situ. Change in functioning was preceded by agoraphobic avoidance and psychological flexibility across all phases of treatment, by fear of bodily symptoms during generalization/follow-up, and by anxiety sensitivity during exposure. The effects of process variables on outcomes differ across treatment phases and outcomes (i.e., symptomatology vs. functioning). Agoraphobic avoidance and psychological flexibility should be investigated and therapeutically targeted in addition to cognitive variables.

Efficacy of psychotherapeutic interventions to promote forgiveness: A meta-analysis,"This meta-analysis addressed the efficacy of psychotherapeutic interventions to help people forgive others and to examine moderators of treatment effects. Eligible studies reported quantitative data on forgiveness of a specific hurt following treatment by a professional with an intervention designed explicitly to promote forgiveness. Random effects meta-analyses were conducted using k = 53 posttreatment effect sizes (N = 2,323) and k = 41 follow-up effect sizes (N = 1,716) from a total of 54 published and unpublished research reports. Participants receiving explicit forgiveness treatments reported significantly greater forgiveness than participants not receiving treatment ([DELTA+] = 0.56 [0.43, 0.68]) and participants, receiving alternative treatments ([DELTA+] = 0.45 [0.21, 0.69]). Also, forgiveness treatments resulted in greater changes in depression, anxiety, and hope than no-treatment conditions. Moderators of treatment efficacy included treatment dosage, offense severity, treatment model, and treatment modality. Multimoderator analyses indicated that treatment dosage (i.e., longer interventions) and modality (individual > group) uniquely predicted change in forgiveness compared with no-treatment controls. Compared with alternative treatment conditions, both modality (individual > group) and offense severity were marginally predictive (ps < .10) of treatment effects. It appears that using theoretically grounded forgiveness interventions is a sound choice for helping clients to deal with past offenses and helping them achieve resolution in the form of forgiveness. Differences between treatment approaches disappeared when controlling for other significant moderators; the advantage for individual interventions was most clearly demonstrated for Enright-model interventions, as there have been no studies of individual interventions using the Worthington model.

Randomized controlled trial of parent-enhanced CBT compared with individual CBT for obsessive-compulsive disorder in young people,"Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) in young people can be effectively treated with Cognitive Behavior Therapy (CBT). Practice guidelines in the United Kingdom recommend that CBT be delivered with parental or family involvement; however, there is no evidence from randomized trials that this enhances effectiveness. The aim of this trial was to assess if CBT with high parental involvement was more effective than CBT with low parental involvement (individual CBT) in reducing symptoms of OCD. Fifty young people ages 12-17 years with OCD were randomly allocated to individual CBT or parent-enhanced CBT. In parent-enhanced CBT parents attended all treatment sessions; in individual CBT, parents attended only Sessions 1, 7, and the final session. Participants received up to 14 sessions of CBT. Data were analyzed using intent-to-treat and per-protocol methods. The primary outcome measure was the Children's Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsion Scale (Scahill et al., 1997). Both forms of CBT significantly reduced symptoms of OCD and anxiety. Change in OCD symptoms was maintained at 6 months. Per-protocol analysis suggested that parent-enhanced CBT may be associated with significantly larger reductions in anxiety symptoms. High and low parental involvement in CBT for OCD in young people were both effective, and there was no evidence that 1 method of delivery was superior on the primary outcome measure. However, this study was small. Future trials should be adequately powered and examine interactions with the age of the young person and comorbid anxiety disorders.

Mechanisms of change in an exposure-based treatment for irritable bowel syndrome,"The aim of this study was to identify mediators of change in a previously published randomized controlled trial that compared Internet-delivered cognitive behavioral treatment based on exposure exercises (ICBT) with Internet-delivered stress management (ISM) for irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). ICBT and ISM targeted distinct proposed mechanisms of illness maintenance and symptom exacerbation, gastrointestinal symptom-specific anxiety (GSA), and stress reactivity, respectively. The original study found that ICBT was more effective than ISM in improving IBS symptoms. Weekly measurements of GSA and stress reactivity (putative mediators) and treatment outcome were obtained from 195 participants with IBS, who had been randomized to ICBT or ISM. Parallel process growth mediational analyses revealed that the larger reduction of IBS symptoms from ICBT compared to ISM was mediated by changes in GSA, aBeta = -0.42, 95% CIasymmetric [-0.71, -0.16]. In contrast, changes in stress reactivity did not mediate the difference in outcomes between treatments, aBeta = 0.04, 95% CIasymmetric [-0.09, 0.20]. Analyses of the temporal sequence of week-to-week changes in process and outcome measures showed that only GSA displayed a pattern consistent with a causal model in which change in process preceded and contributed to symptom change. Furthermore, engagement in treatment specific activities was related to change in GSA but not to stress reactivity in the ICBT arm, whereas treatment specific activities were not related to change in any of the putative processes in the ISM arm. We conclude that ICBT works through directly targeting GSA, rather than by means of reducing stress reactivity. [Copyright American Psychological Association]",1512194181, Journal Article,2013
Long-term outcomes for the Child STEPs randomized effectiveness trial: A comparison of modular and standard treatment designs with usual care,"This article reports outcomes from the Child STEPs randomized effectiveness trial conducted over a 2-year period to gauge the longer term impact of protocol design on the effectiveness of evidence-based treatment procedures. An ethnoracially diverse sample of 174 youths ages 7- 13 (N = 121 boys) whose primary clinical concerns involved diagnoses or clinical elevations related to anxiety, depression, or disruptive behavior were treated by community therapists randomly assigned to 1 of 3 conditions: (a) standard, which involved the use of 1 or more of 3 manualized evidence-based treatments, (b) modular, which involved a single modular protocol (Modular Approach to Treatment of Children With Anxiety, Depression, or Conduct Problems; MATCH) having clinical procedures similar to the standard condition but flexibly selected and sequenced using a guiding clinical algorithm, and (c) usual care. As measured with combined Child Behavior Checklist and Youth Self-Report Total Problems, Internalizing, and Externalizing scales, the rate of improvement for youths in the modular condition was significantly better than for those in usual care. On a measure of functional impairment (Brief Impairment Scale), no significant differences were found among the 3 conditions. Analysis of service utilization also showed no significant differences among conditions, with almost half of youths receiving some additional services in the 1st year after beginning treatment, and roughly one third of youths in the 2nd year. Overall, these results extend prior findings, supporting incremental benefits of MATCH over usual care over a 2-year period.

D-cycloserine augmentation of cognitive behavioral group therapy of social anxiety disorder: Prognostic and prescriptive variables,"The aim of the current study was to identify individual characteristics that (a) predict symptom improvement with group cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) for social anxiety disorder (SAD; i.e., prognostic variables) or (b) moderate the effects of d-cycloserine (DCS) versus placebo augmentation of CBT for SAD (i.e., prescriptive variables). Adults with SAD (N = 169) provided Liebowitz Social Anxiety Scale scores in a trial evaluating DCS augmentation of group CBT. Rate of symptom improvement during therapy and posttreatment symptom severity were evaluated using multilevel modeling. As predictors of these 2 parameters, we selected the range of variables assessed at baseline (demographic characteristics, clinical characteristics, personality traits). Using step-wise analyses, we first identified prognostic and prescriptive variables within each of these domains and then entered these significant predictors simultaneously in 1 final model. African American ethnicity and cohabitation status were associated with greater overall rates of improvement during therapy and lower posttreatment severity. Higher initial severity was associated with a greater improvement during therapy but also higher posttreatment severity (the greater improvement was not enough to overcome the initial higher severity). DCS augmentation was evident only among individuals low in conscientiousness and high in agreeableness. African American ethnicity, cohabitation status, and initial severity are prognostic of favorable CBT outcomes in SAD. DCS augmentation appears particularly useful for patients low in conscientiousness and high in agreeableness. These findings can guide clinicians in making decisions about treatment strategies and can help direct research on the mechanisms of these treatments.

"Two-year course of generalized anxiety disorder, social anxiety disorder, and panic disorder in a longitudinal sample of African American adults","Anxiety disorders are the most common group of psychiatric disorders in adults. In addition to high prevalence, anxiety disorders are associated with significant functional impairment, and published research has consistently found them to have a chronic course. To date, very little research has explored the clinical characteristics and prospective course of anxiety disorders in racial and ethnic minority samples. The aims of this article are to present clinical and demographic characteristics at intake and prospective 2-year course findings in a sample of African American adults. Data are presented from 152 African Americans diagnosed with generalized anxiety disorder (GAD, n = 94), social anxiety disorder (SAD, n = 85), and panic disorder with agoraphobia (PDA, n = 77) who are participating in the Harvard/Brown Anxiety Research Project-Phase II (HARP-II). HARP-II is an observational, prospective, longitudinal study of the course of anxiety disorders. Participants were interviewed at intake and annually for 2 years of follow-up. Probabilities of recovery over 2 years of follow-up were calculated using standard survival analysis methods. Survival analyses revealed a chronic course for all anxiety disorders, with rates of recovery of 0.23, 0.07, and 0.00 over 2 years for GAD, SAD, and PDA, respectively. These rates of recovery were lower than those reported in predominantly non-Latino White longitudinal samples, especially for SAD and PDA, suggesting that anxiety disorders may have a more chronic course for African Americans, with increased psychosocial impairment and high rates of comorbid Axis-I disorders. Clinical implications of these findings are discussed. [Copyright American Psychological Association]",1512192062, Journal Article,2013
Mechanisms of change in an exposure-based treatment for irritable bowel syndrome,"  The aim of this study was to identify mediators of change in a previously published randomized controlled trial that compared Internet-delivered cognitive behavioral treatment based on exposure exercises (ICBT) with Internet-delivered stress management (ISM) for irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). ICBT and ISM targeted distinct proposed mechanisms of illness maintenance and symptom exacerbation, gastrointestinal symptom-specific anxiety (GSA), and stress reactivity, respectively. The original study found that ICBT was more effective than ISM in improving IBS symptoms. Weekly measurements of GSA and stress reactivity (putative mediators) and treatment outcome were obtained from 195 participants with IBS, who had been randomized to ICBT or ISM. Parallel process growth mediational analyses revealed that the larger reduction of IBS symptoms from ICBT compared to ISM was mediated by changes in GSA, αβ = -0.42, 95% CIasymmetric [-0.71, -0.16]. In contrast, changes in stress reactivity did not mediate the difference in outcomes between treatments, αβ = 0.04, 95% CIasymmetric [-0.09, 0.20]. Analyses of the temporal sequence of week-to-week changes in process and outcome measures showed that only GSA displayed a pattern consistent with a causal model in which change in process preceded and contributed to symptom change. Furthermore, engagement in treatment specific activities was related to change in GSA but not to stress reactivity in the ICBT arm, whereas treatment specific activities were not related to change in any of the putative processes in the ISM arm. We conclude that ICBT works through directly targeting GSA, rather than by means of reducing stress reactivity.",1467451726, Feature,2013
Long-term outcomes for the Child STEPs randomized effectiveness trial: A comparison of modular and standard treatment designs with usual care,"  This article reports outcomes from the Child STEPs randomized effectiveness trial conducted over a 2-year period to gauge the longer term impact of protocol design on the effectiveness of evidence-based treatment procedures. An ethnoracially diverse sample of 174 youths ages 7- 13 (N = 121 boys) whose primary clinical concerns involved diagnoses or clinical elevations related to anxiety, depression, or disruptive behavior were treated by community therapists randomly assigned to 1 of 3 conditions: (a) standard, which involved the use of 1 or more of 3 manualized evidence-based treatments, (b) modular, which involved a single modular protocol (Modular Approach to Treatment of Children With Anxiety, Depression, or Conduct Problems; MATCH) having clinical procedures similar to the standard condition but flexibly selected and sequenced using a guiding clinical algorithm, and (c) usual care. As measured with combined Child Behavior Checklist and Youth Self-Report Total Problems, Internalizing, and Externalizing scales, the rate of improvement for youths in the modular condition was significantly better than for those in usual care. On a measure of functional impairment (Brief Impairment Scale), no significant differences were found among the 3 conditions. Analysis of service utilization also showed no significant differences among conditions, with almost half of youths receiving some additional services in the 1st year after beginning treatment, and roughly one third of youths in the 2nd year. Overall, these results extend prior findings, supporting incremental benefits of MATCH over usual care over a 2-year period.",1467451678, Feature,2013
Randomized controlled trial of parent-enhanced CBT compared with individual CBT for obsessive-compulsive disorder in young people,"  Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) in young people can be effectively treated with Cognitive Behavior Therapy (CBT). Practice guidelines in the United Kingdom recommend that CBT be delivered with parental or family involvement; however, there is no evidence from randomized trials that this enhances effectiveness. The aim of this trial was to assess if CBT with high parental involvement was more effective than CBT with low parental involvement (individual CBT) in reducing symptoms of OCD. Fifty young people ages 12-17 years with OCD were randomly allocated to individual CBT or parent-enhanced CBT. In parent-enhanced CBT parents attended all treatment sessions; in individual CBT, parents attended only Sessions 1, 7, and the final session. Participants received up to 14 sessions of CBT. Data were analyzed using intent-to-treat and per-protocol methods. The primary outcome measure was the Children's Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsion Scale (Scahill et al., 1997). Both forms of CBT significantly reduced symptoms of OCD and anxiety. Change in OCD symptoms was maintained at 6 months. Per-protocol analysis suggested that parent-enhanced CBT may be associated with significantly larger reductions in anxiety symptoms. High and low parental involvement in CBT for OCD in young people were both effective, and there was no evidence that 1 method of delivery was superior on the primary outcome measure. However, this study was small. Future trials should be adequately powered and examine interactions with the age of the young person and comorbid anxiety disorders.",1467451625, Feature,2013
D-cycloserine augmentation of cognitive behavioral group therapy of social anxiety disorder: Prognostic and prescriptive variables,"  The aim of the current study was to identify individual characteristics that (a) predict symptom improvement with group cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) for social anxiety disorder (SAD; i.e., prognostic variables) or (b) moderate the effects of d-cycloserine (DCS) versus placebo augmentation of CBT for SAD (i.e., prescriptive variables). Adults with SAD (N = 169) provided Liebowitz Social Anxiety Scale scores in a trial evaluating DCS augmentation of group CBT. Rate of symptom improvement during therapy and posttreatment symptom severity were evaluated using multilevel modeling. As predictors of these 2 parameters, we selected the range of variables assessed at baseline (demographic characteristics, clinical characteristics, personality traits). Using step-wise analyses, we first identified prognostic and prescriptive variables within each of these domains and then entered these significant predictors simultaneously in 1 final model. African American ethnicity and cohabitation status were associated with greater overall rates of improvement during therapy and lower posttreatment severity. Higher initial severity was associated with a greater improvement during therapy but also higher posttreatment severity (the greater improvement was not enough to overcome the initial higher severity). DCS augmentation was evident only among individuals low in conscientiousness and high in agreeableness. African American ethnicity, cohabitation status, and initial severity are prognostic of favorable CBT outcomes in SAD. DCS augmentation appears particularly useful for patients low in conscientiousness and high in agreeableness. These findings can guide clinicians in making decisions about treatment strategies and can help direct research on the mechanisms of these treatments.",1467451474, Feature,2013
"Two-year course of generalized anxiety disorder, social anxiety disorder, and panic disorder in a longitudinal sample of African American adults","  Anxiety disorders are the most common group of psychiatric disorders in adults. In addition to high prevalence, anxiety disorders are associated with significant functional impairment, and published research has consistently found them to have a chronic course. To date, very little research has explored the clinical characteristics and prospective course of anxiety disorders in racial and ethnic minority samples. The aims of this article are to present clinical and demographic characteristics at intake and prospective 2-year course findings in a sample of African American adults. Data are presented from 152 African Americans diagnosed with generalized anxiety disorder (GAD, n = 94), social anxiety disorder (SAD, n = 85), and panic disorder with agoraphobia (PDA, n = 77) who are participating in the Harvard/Brown Anxiety Research Project-Phase II (HARP-II). HARP-II is an observational, prospective, longitudinal study of the course of anxiety disorders. Participants were interviewed at intake and annually for 2 years of follow-up. Probabilities of recovery over 2 years of follow-up were calculated using standard survival analysis methods. Survival analyses revealed a chronic course for all anxiety disorders, with rates of recovery of 0.23, 0.07, and 0.00 over 2 years for GAD, SAD, and PDA, respectively. These rates of recovery were lower than those reported in predominantly non-Latino White longitudinal samples, especially for SAD and PDA, suggesting that anxiety disorders may have a more chronic course for African Americans, with increased psychosocial impairment and high rates of comorbid Axis-I disorders. Clinical implications of these findings are discussed.",1467451248, Feature,2013
Contingency management treatments decrease psychiatric symptoms,"Contingency management (CM) is an empirically validated treatment for substance use disorders, but its effects on psychiatric symptoms have not been systematically examined. The purpose of this study was to examine the impact of CM on psychiatric symptoms of cocaine dependent patients receiving CM with standard care versus standard care alone. Psychiatric symptoms were evaluated in 393 patients participating in 1 of 3 randomized trials of CM at treatment initiation and 1, 3 (posttreatment), 6, and 9 months later. Patients randomized to CM evidenced significant reductions in psychiatric symptoms over time throughout the 9-month follow-up. In contrast, psychiatric symptoms remained stable relative to baseline in patients randomized to standard care. A significant time by treatment condition effect was noted (p < .05) for overall psychiatric distress as well as for specific indices of depression, hostility, interpersonal sensitivity, phobic anxiety and psychoticism symptoms. Reductions in drug use mediated the effects of CM on psychiatric symptoms. These data demonstrate that the effects of CM extend beyond their impact on drug use behaviors and the period in which reinforcers are in effect.

A randomized clinical trial comparing an acceptance-based behavior therapy to applied relaxation for generalized anxiety disorder,"To examine whether an empirically and theoretically derived treatment combining mindfulness- and acceptance-based strategies with behavioral approaches would improve outcomes in generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) over an empirically supported treatment. This trial randomized 81 individuals (65.4% female, 80.2% identified as White, average age 32.92) diagnosed with GAD to receive 16 sessions of either an acceptance-based behavior therapy (ABBT) or applied relaxation (AR). Assessments at pretreatment, posttreatment, and 6-month follow-up included the following primary outcome measures: GAD clinician severity rating, Structured Interview Guide for the Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale, Penn State Worry Questionnaire, Depression Anxiety Stress Scale, and the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory. Secondary outcomes included the Beck Depression Inventory -- II, Quality of Life Inventory, and number of comorbid diagnoses. Mixed effect regression models showed significant, large effects for time for all primary outcome measures (ds = 1.27 to 1.61) but nonsignificant, small effects for condition and Condition x Time (ds = 0.002 to 0.20), indicating that clients in the 2 treatments improved comparably over treatment. For secondary outcomes, time was significant (ds = 0.74 to 1.38), but condition and Condition x Time effects were not (ds = 0.004 to 0.31). No significant differences emerged over follow-up (ds = 0.03 to 0.39), indicating maintenance of gains. Between 63.3 and 80.0% of clients in ABBT and 60.6 and 78.8% of clients in AR experienced clinically significant change across 5 calculations of change at posttreatment and follow-up. ABBT is a viable alternative for treating GAD. [Copyright American Psychological Association]",1512194470, Journal Article,2013
The efficacy of a family-based cognitive-behavioral treatment for separation anxiety disorder in children aged 8-13: A randomized comparison with a general anxiety program,"This randomized controlled trial examines the relative efficacy of a disorder-specific treatment program (TrennungsAngstprogramm Fur Familien [TAFF]; English: Separation Anxiety Family Therapy) for children suffering from separation anxiety disorder (SAD) in comparison with a general anxiety program. Sixty-four children aged 8-13 with SAD and their parents were assigned either to a 16-session disorder-specific SAD treatment program, including parent training and classical cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) components (TAFF), or to a general child-focused 16-week comparison group (Coping Cat [CC]) without any parent training. Diagnoses and parent cognitions were assessed at baseline and at follow-ups. Global success ratings were collected at end of treatment and at follow-up. Ratings for anxiety, impairment/distress, and life quality were collected at Baseline 1, again after a 4-week waiting period, repeatedly throughout treatment, at 4 weeks, and at 1-year follow-up. The response rate (no SAD diagnosis) at 4-week follow-up among the 52 treatment completers was 87.5% vs. 82.1% (TAFF vs. CC; intent-to-treat: 67.7% vs. 69.7%). At 1-year follow-up, the response was 83.3% versus 75% (TAFF vs. CC; intent to treat: 64.5% vs. 63.6%). Differences were nonsignificant. Results from rating scales indicated improvement for both groups across time points and assessment areas, with few between-group differences, and some small effects favoring the TAFF program. Both treatment programs yielded a reduction in parental dysfunctional beliefs. Results indicate a slight advantage of the TAFF program over a general child-based treatment for SAD. However, these differences were less strong than hypothesized, indicating that the inclusion of parent training does not add large effects to classical child-based CBT in school-age children with SAD.

The therapeutic relationship in cognitive-behavioral therapy and pharmacotherapy for anxious youth,"We examined the therapeutic relationship with cognitive-behavioral therapists and with pharmacotherapists for youth from the Child/Adolescent Anxiety Multimodal Study (Walkup et al., 2008). The therapeutic relationship was examined in relation to treatment outcomes. Participants were 488 youth (ages 7-17 years; 50% male) randomized to cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT; Coping Cat), pharmacotherapy (sertraline), their combination, or placebo pill. Participants met criteria for generalized anxiety disorder, social phobia, and/or separation anxiety disorder according to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (4th ed.; American Psychiatric Association, 1994). The therapeutic relationship was assessed by youth report at Weeks 6 and 12 of treatment using the Child's Perception of Therapeutic Relationship scale (Kendall et al., 1997). Outcome measures (Pediatric Anxiety Rating Scale; Research Units on Pediatric Psychopharmacology Anxiety Study Group, 2002; and Clinical Global Impressions Scales; Guy, 1976) were completed by independent evaluators blind to condition. For youth who received CBT only, a stronger therapeutic relationship predicted positive treatment outcome. In contrast, the therapeutic relationship did not predict outcome for youth receiving sertraline, combined treatment, or placebo. A therapeutic relationship may be important for anxious youth who receive CBT alone. [Copyright American Psychological Association]",1512194014, Journal Article,2013
The immigrant paradox among Asian American women: Are disparities in the burden of depression and anxiety paradoxical or explicable?,"We evaluated potential explanations for advantaged mental health status among immigrant Asian American women compared to U.S.-born Asian American women. In a nationally representative sample of 1,030 women (185 U.S.-born, 368 early-life immigrants [arrived before 25 years of age], 477 late-life immigrants), we examined the hypothesis that increased exposure to social risk factors mediate nativity-based differences in lifetime prevalence of depression and anxiety disorders. Indicators of social class were also examined as protective factors enjoyed by U.S.-born women that may suppress observed nativity-based disparities. We also examined whether there were group differences in reactivity to stress in predicting disorder. U.S.-born women were twice as likely as late-life immigrants to report lifetime history of depression (odds ratio [OR] = 2.03, 95% CI [1.35, 4.54]) and anxiety (OR = 2.12, 95% CI [1.34, 5.19]). Nativity differences in perceived discrimination, family conflict, and cultural conflict explained disparities in rates of disorder. There was no support for the contention that immigrant women were more psychologically hardy or resilient to social stress. Findings suggest that the gap in mental health status between U.S.- and foreign-born Asian American women would indeed be magnified if differences in social status were accounted for, but also that ready explanations for the so-called immigrant paradox are found in differential levels of reported stress exposure.

Pretreatment anxiety predicts patterns of change in cognitive behavioral therapy and medications for depression,"Some studies report that initial anxiety is associated with equivocal or negative effects in depression treatment. In contrast, at least 4 studies of cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) report that anxiety predicts greater or more rapid change in depression. Further exploration is needed to clarify the relationship between initial anxiety and depression change. Questions include the relationship between anxiety and patterns of change and time to relapse, as well as the specificity effects to CBT. The study assessed the relation of Beck Anxiety Inventory anxiety scores to early rapid change and overall change in Beck Depression Inventory-II depression scores during acute depression treatment. Participants were 178 individuals enrolled in a randomized controlled trial of CBT versus antidepressant medications (ADMs) for moderate to severe depression. They were 58% female and 83% Caucasian, with an average age of 40 (SD = 11.5). Thirty-four percent (34%) were married or cohabitating. Hierarchical linear models, including quadratic growth parameters, were used to model change. The relation of anxiety to the probability of posttreatment relapse was also examined. Findings indicate that higher levels of anxiety predict early rapid change, but not overall change, in both CBT and ADM. However, patients with higher levels of intake anxiety evidenced increased risk for relapse after CBT. Early rapid change predicted by anxiety occurs across different treatment conditions, but this early rapid response is not indicative of positive overall outcome in all cases. These findings might indicate that anxiety predicts a response to nonspecific 'common factors' of treatment. [Copyright American Psychological Association]",1512192744, Journal Article,2013
Anxiety and related outcomes in young adults 7 to 19 years after receiving treatment for child anxiety,"This study evaluated follow-up outcomes associated with cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) for childhood anxiety by comparing successfully and unsuccessfully treated participants 6.72 to 19.17 years after treatment. Participants were a sample of 66 youths (ages 7-14 years at time of treatment, ages 18-32 years at present follow-up) who had been diagnosed with an anxiety disorder and randomized to treatment in a randomized clinical trial on average 16.24 (SD = 3.56, range = 6.72-19.17) years prior. The present follow-up included self-report measures and a diagnostic interview to assess anxiety, depression, and substance misuse. Compared with those who responded successfully to CBT for an anxiety disorder in childhood, those who were less responsive had higher rates of panic disorder, alcohol dependence, and drug abuse in adulthood. Relative to a normative comparison group, those who were less responsive to CBT in childhood had higher rates of several anxiety disorders and substance misuse problems in adulthood. Participants remained at particularly increased risk, relative to the normative group, for generalized anxiety disorder and nicotine dependence regardless of initial treatment outcome. The present study is the first to assess the long-term follow-up effects of CBT treatment for an anxiety disorder in youth on anxiety, depression, and substance abuse through the period of young adulthood when these disorders are often seen. Results support the presence of important long-term benefits of successful early CBT for anxiety. [Copyright American Psychological Association]",1512192741, Journal Article,2013
Combining imagination and reason in the treatment of depression: A randomized controlled trial of internet-based cognitive-bias modification and internet-CBT for depression,"Computerized cognitive-bias modification (CBM) protocols are rapidly evolving in experimental medicine yet might best be combined with Internet-based cognitive behavioral therapy (iCBT). No research to date has evaluated the combined approach in depression. The current randomized controlled trial aimed to evaluate both the independent effects of a CBM protocol targeting imagery and interpretation bias (CBM-I) and the combined effects of CBM-I followed by iCBT. Patients diagnosed with a major depressive episode were randomized to an 11-week intervention (1 week/CBM-I + 10 weeks/iCBT; n = 38) that was delivered via the Internet with no face-to-face patient contact or to a wait-list control (WLC; n = 31). Intent-to-treat marginal models using restricted maximum likelihood estimation demonstrated significant reductions in primary measures of depressive symptoms and distress corresponding to medium-large effect sizes (Cohen's d = 0.62-2.40) following CBM-I and the combined (CBM-I + iCBT) intervention. Analyses demonstrated that the change in interpretation bias at least partially mediated the reduction in depression symptoms following CBM-I. Treatment superiority over the WLC was also evident on all outcome measures at both time points (Hedges gs = .59-.98). Significant reductions were also observed following the combined intervention on secondary measures associated with depression: disability, anxiety, and repetitive negative thinking (Cohen's d = 1.51-2.23). Twenty-seven percent of patients evidenced clinically significant change following CBM-I, and this proportion increased to 65% following the combined intervention. The current study provides encouraging results of the integration of Internet-based technologies into an efficacious and acceptable form of treatment delivery.

Virtual reality exposure therapy for social anxiety disorder: A randomized controlled trial,"This is the first randomized trial comparing virtual reality exposure therapy to in vivo exposure for social anxiety disorder. Participants with a principal diagnosis of social anxiety disorder who identified public speaking as their primary fear (N = 97) were recruited from the community, resulting in an ethnically diverse sample (M age = 39 years) of mostly women (62%). Participants were randomly assigned to and completed 8 sessions of manualized virtual reality exposure therapy, exposure group therapy, or wait list. Standardized self-report measures were collected at pretreatment, posttreatment, and 12-month follow-up, and process measures were collected during treatment. A standardized speech task was delivered at pre- and posttreatment, and diagnostic status was reassessed at 3-month follow-up. Analysis of covariance showed that, relative to wait list, people completing either active treatment significantly improved on all but one measure (length of speech for exposure group therapy and self-reported fear of negative evaluation for virtual reality exposure therapy). At 12-month follow-up, people showed significant improvement from pretreatment on all measures. There were no differences between the active treatments on any process or outcome measure at any time, nor differences on achieving partial or full remission. Virtual reality exposure therapy is effective for treating social fears, and improvement is maintained for 1 year. Virtual reality exposure therapy is equally effective as exposure group therapy; further research with a larger sample is needed, however, to better control and statistically test differences between the treatments.

Patients diagnosed with a major depressive episode were randomized to an 11-week intervention (1 week/CBM-I + 10 weeks/iCBT; n = 38) that was delivered via the Internet with no face-to-face patient contact or to a wait-list control (WLC; n = 31). Intent-to-treat marginal models using restricted maximum likelihood estimation demonstrated significant reductions in primary measures of depressive symptoms and distress corresponding to medium-large effect sizes (Cohen's d = 0.62-2.40) following CBM-I and the combined (CBM-I + iCBT) intervention. Analyses demonstrated that the change in interpretation bias at least partially mediated the reduction in depression symptoms following CBM-I. Treatment superiority over the WLC was also evident on all outcome measures at both time points (Hedges gs = .59-.98). Significant reductions were also observed following the combined intervention on secondary measures associated with depression: disability, anxiety, and repetitive negative thinking (Cohen's d = 1.51-2.23). Twenty-seven percent of patients evidenced clinically significant change following CBM-I, and this proportion increased to 65% following the combined intervention. The current study provides encouraging results of the integration of Internet-based technologies into an efficacious and acceptable form of treatment delivery.",1438891070, Feature,2013
A randomized clinical trial comparing an acceptance-based behavior therapy to applied relaxation for generalized anxiety disorder,"  To examine whether an empirically and theoretically derived treatment combining mindfulness- and acceptance-based strategies with behavioral approaches would improve outcomes in generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) over an empirically supported treatment. This trial randomized 81 individuals (65.4% female, 80.2% identified as White, average age 32.92) diagnosed with GAD to receive 16 sessions of either an acceptance-based behavior therapy (ABBT) or applied relaxation (AR). Assessments at pretreatment, posttreatment, and 6-month follow-up included the following primary outcome measures: GAD clinician severity rating, Structured Interview Guide for the Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale, Penn State Worry Questionnaire, Depression Anxiety Stress Scale, and the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory. Secondary outcomes included the Beck Depression Inventory -- II, Quality of Life Inventory, and number of comorbid diagnoses. Mixed effect regression models showed significant, large effects for time for all primary outcome measures (ds = 1.27 to 1.61) but nonsignificant, small effects for condition and Condition x Time (ds = 0.002 to 0.20), indicating that clients in the 2 treatments improved comparably over treatment. For secondary outcomes, time was significant (ds = 0.74 to 1.38), but condition and Condition x Time effects were not (ds = 0.004 to 0.31). No significant differences emerged over follow-up (ds = 0.03 to 0.39), indicating maintenance of gains. Between 63.3 and 80.0% of clients in ABBT and 60.6 and 78.8% of clients in AR experienced clinically significant change across 5 calculations of change at posttreatment and follow-up. ABBT is a viable alternative for treating GAD.",1438891046, Feature,2013
Who gets the most out of cognitive behavioral therapy for anxiety disorders? The role of treatment dose and patient engagement,"The present study explored treatment dose and patient engagement as predictors of treatment outcome in cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) for anxiety disorders. Measures of high versus low treatment dose and high versus low patient engagement in CBT were compared as predictors of 12- and 18-month outcomes for patients being treated for anxiety disorders with CBT (with or without concurrent pharmacotherapy) in primary care settings as part of a randomized controlled effectiveness trial of the Coordinated Anxiety Learning and Management (CALM) intervention. Measures of dose (attendance, exposure completion) and engagement in CBT (homework adherence, commitment) were collected throughout treatment, and blinded follow-up phone assessments of outcome measures (12-item Brief Symptom Inventory, Patient Health Questionnaire 8, Sheehan Disability Scale) were completed at 12 and 18 months. Propensity score weighting controlled for baseline differences in demographics and symptom severity between patients with high and low dose and engagement. These analyses included the 439 patients who selected CBT as treatment modality. Completing exposures, having high attendance, and being more adherent to completing homework predicted better outcomes across all measures at 12 and 18 months, and high CBT commitment predicted better outcomes on all measures at 18 months. This study found that higher treatment dose and patient engagement in CBT for anxiety disorders were stable and robust predictors of greater reductions in anxiety symptoms, depression symptoms, and functional disability.

Shape of change in cognitive behavioral therapy for youth anxiety: Symptom trajectory and predictors of change,"Multilevel growth analysis was used to establish the mean growth trajectory (shape of change) for cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) for youth with anxiety disorders. Two-level growth analysis was conducted to identify important between-youth predictors of session-by-session symptom change. Fifty-five youth (ages 7-17; 50.9% male) and their parents participated in a 16- to 20-week CBT that emphasized affective, cognitive, and exposure-based exercises. Multilevel growth models (MLMs) were estimated to model session symptom data taking into account an 'anxiety spike' hypothesized to occur at initiation of exposure sessions. Three models were compared: a cubic curve, a log-linear curve plus an exposure covariate, and a linear curve plus exposure covariate. Two-level MLM examined the effect of demographic traits (sex, age, race/ethnicity), pretreatment symptom severity, comorbid school refusal, early treatment factors (use of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor medication, therapeutic alliance, treatment attrition), and pretreatment coping (engagement, disengagement, and involuntary coping). Fit indices provided support for the cubic growth model using either parent or youth anxiety data. Level 2 analysis identified youth age, symptom severity (anxiety, externalizing), early attrition, and engagement and disengagement coping as significant predictors of symptom trajectories. Predictors accounted for 34%-37% of between-youth variance in midtreatment anxiety scores. Findings suggest that the symptom course of CBT, and the effect of between-youth factors on treatment outcomes, is more complex than previously thought. Educating therapists and clients about findings can aid treatment expectations and dissemination efforts of empirically supported treatments.

"Anxiety and depression in transgender individuals: The roles of transition status, loss, social support, and coping","Objective: The purpose of the current study was to examine facilitative and avoidant coping as mediators between distress and transition status, social support, and loss. Method: A total of 351 transgender individuals (n = 226 transgender women and n = 125 transgender men) participated in this study. Participants completed measures on transgender identity, family history of mental health concerns, perceptions of loss, coping, depression, and anxiety. Results: The rates of depressive symptoms (51.4% for transgender women; 48.3% for transgender men) and anxiety (40.4% for transgender women; 47.5% for transgender men) within the current study far surpass the rates of those for the general population. Structural equation modeling (SEM) was used to analyze the data -- 2 separate models were hypothesized, based on reports of anxiety or depression. The SEM results suggest that the processes for transgender women and transgender men are primarily similar for depression and anxiety; avoidant coping served as a mediator between transition status and both distress variables. Social support was directly related to distress variables, as well as indirectly related through avoidant coping. Conclusion: Results suggest the need for practitioners to focus on interventions that reduce avoidant coping strategies, while simultaneously increasing social support, in order to improve mental health for transgender individuals. Individuals who are in the beginning stages of their transition will use different coping strategies than those who are in later stages; interventions should be adjusted on the basis of the transition status of transgender clients.

Specificity and modifiability of cognitive biases in hypochondriasis,"Objective: According to cognitive-behavioral models of hypochondriasis (HYP), biased attentional and memory processes related to health threat stimuli are crucial for the development and maintenance of severe health anxiety. Little is known about the specificity, temporal stability, and modifiability of these biases via psychotherapy. Method: In an emotional Stroop and subsequent recognition task, the authors compared attention and memory processes for health-related words (illnesses, bodily complaints, and panic-related words) in patients with HYP (n = 32), other somatoform disorders (SFD; n = 27), and panic disorder (PD; n = 25). A control group consisted of 31 healthy participants (CG). All patients were reexamined after 4 months of cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT). Results: Patients with HYP showed a significant attentional bias toward all 3 target word categories. Evidence for a specific bias was found only for the PD group. General recognition performance for health threat and neutral words was best in the HYP group. After therapy, attentional bias had clearly decreased in the HYP and SFD patients. Conclusions: Patients with HYP can be characterized by attentional bias and more elaborate verbal processing. These irregularities tend to disappear after psychotherapy.

Mediated moderation in combined cognitive behavioral therapy versus component treatments for generalized anxiety disorder,"Objective: This study examined (a) duration of generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) as a moderator of cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) versus its components (cognitive therapy and self-control desensitization) and (b) increases in dynamic flexibility of anxious symptoms during the course of psychotherapy as a mediator of this moderation. Degree of dynamic flexibility in daily symptoms was quantified as the inverse of spectral power due to daily to intradaily oscillations in four-times-daily diary data (Fisher, Newman, & Molenaar, 2011). Method: This was a secondary analysis of the data of Borkovec, Newman, Pincus, and Lytle (2002). Seventy-six participants with a principle diagnosis of GAD were assigned randomly to combined CBT (n = 24), cognitive therapy (n = 25), or self-control desensitization (n = 27). Results: Duration of GAD moderated outcome such that those with longer duration showed greater reliable change from component treatments than they showed from CBT, whereas those with shorter duration fared better in response to CBT. Decreasing predictability in daily and intradaily oscillations of anxiety symptoms during therapy reflected less rigidity and more flexible responding. Increases in flexibility over the course of therapy fully mediated the moderating effect of GAD duration on condition, indicating a mediated moderation process. Conclusions: Individuals with longer duration of GAD may respond better to more focused treatments, whereas those with shorter duration of GAD may respond better to a treatment that offers more coping strategies. Importantly, the mechanism by which this moderation occurs appears to be the establishment of flexible responding during treatment.

Hybrid cognitive behavioral therapy versus relaxation training for co-occurring anxiety and alcohol disorder: A randomized clinical trial,"[Correction Notice: An Erratum for this article was reported in Vol 81(3) of Journal of Consulting and Clinical Psychology (see record 2013-04004-001). An abbreviation for social anxiety disorder (SAD) was incorrectly defined as ""seasonal affective disorder"" in the notes for Table 1 and 3. All versions of this article have been corrected.] Objective: Treatment for alcohol use disorder (AUD) is far less effective for those with a co-occurring anxiety disorder. Surprisingly, adding an independent anxiety treatment to AUD treatment does not substantially improve the poor alcohol outcomes of these patients. This may reflect the lack of attention from independent treatments to the dynamic interaction of anxiety symptoms with alcohol use and drinking motivation. On the basis of this view, we assembled a cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) program designed to both reduce anxiety symptoms and weaken the links between the experience of anxiety and the motivation to drink. Method: 344 patients undergoing residential AUD treatment with current social phobia, generalized anxiety disorder, or panic disorder were randomly assigned to receive either the CBT or an active comparison treatment, Progressive Muscle Relaxation Training (PMRT). Assessments took place immediately following treatment and 4 months later (n = 247). Results: As predicted, the CBT group demonstrated significantly better alcohol outcomes 4 months following treatment than did the PMRT group. Although both groups experienced a substantial degree of anxiety reduction following treatment, there were no significant group differences immediately after treatment and only a slight advantage for the CBT group 4 months after treatment. Conclusions: These findings suggest that specific interventions aimed at weakening the association between the experience of anxiety and drinking motivation play an important role in improving the alcohol outcomes of these difficult-to-treat patients beyond that of anxiety reduction alone.

Latent profile analysis to determine the typology of disinhibited eating behaviors in children and adolescents,"Objective: We used latent profile analysis (LPA) to classify children and adolescents into subtypes based on the overlap of disinhibited eating behaviors -- eating in the absence of hunger, emotional eating, and subjective and objective binge eating. Method: Participants were 411 youths (8-18 years) from the community who reported on their disinhibited eating patterns. A subset (n = 223) ate ad libitum from two test meals. Results: LPA produced five subtypes that were most prominently distinguished by objective binge eating (OBE; n = 53), subjective binge eating (SBE; n = 59), emotional eating (EE; n = 62), a mix of emotional eating and eating in the absence of hunger (EE-EAH; n = 172), and no disinhibited eating (No-DE; n = 64). Accounting for age, sex, race, and body mass index z score (BMI-z), the four disinhibited eating groups had more problem behaviors than the no disinhibited eating group (p = .001). OBE and SBE subtypes had greater BMI-z, percent fat mass, disordered eating attitudes, and trait anxiety than EE, EE-EAH, and No-DE subtypes (ps < .01). However, the OBE subtype reported the highest eating concern (p < .001), and the OBE, SBE, and EE subtypes reported higher depressive symptoms than the EE-EAH and No-DE subtypes. Across both test meals, OBE and SBE subtypes consumed a lesser percentage of protein and a higher percentage of carbohydrate than the other subtypes (ps < .02), adjusting for age, sex, race, height, lean mass, percent fat mass, and total intake. EE subtypes also consumed a greater percentage of carbohydrate and a lower percentage of fat than the EE-EAH and No-DE subtypes (ps < .03). The SBE subtype consumed the least total calories (p = .01). Discussion: We conclude that behavioral subtypes of disinhibited eating may be distinguished by psychological characteristics and objective eating behavior. Prospective data are required to determine whether subtypes predict the onset of eating disorders and obesity. [Copyright American Psychological Association]",1417548131, Journal Article,2013

Treating depressed and anxious smokers in smoking cessation programs.,"Objective: Cigarette smoking is the leading cause of preventable death in the United States. In addition, smoking rates among depressed and anxious smokers are higher than in the population at large. Furthermore, treating depressed and anxious smokers effectively is particularly challenging because of their significant negative affect, dysfunctional emotional regulation, severe withdrawal symptoms, and numerous institutional barriers to successful treatment. Previous reviews in this area have typically focused on depression or anxiety disorders, whereas this review focuses on both disorders. Method: This article presents a brief review of the literature on treating depressed and anxious smokers in smoking cessation programs. We also discuss treatment issues, challenges, and guidelines regarding effective interventions for depressed and anxious smokers who wish to stop smoking. Results: The potential benefits for better health and improved functioning are quite large. Moreover, the merit of pursuing evidence-based interventions with these comorbid populations of depressed and anxious smokers -- including practical, multidisciplinary, and cost-effective smoking cessation programs -- is compelling.

Psychosocial factors and behavioral medicine interventions in asthma.,"Objective: This review examines the evidence for psychosocial influences in asthma and behavioral medicine approaches to its treatment. Method: We conducted a systematic review of the literature on psychosocial influences and the evidence for behavioral interventions in asthma with a focus on research in the past 10 years and clinical trials. Additional attention was directed at promising new developments in the field. Results: Psychosocial factors can influence the pathogenesis and pathophysiology of asthma, either directly through autonomic, endocrine, immunological, and central nervous system mechanisms or indirectly through lifestyle factors, health behaviors, illness cognitions, and disease management, including medication adherence and trigger avoidance. The recent decade has witnessed surging interest in behavioral interventions that target the various pathways of influence. Among these, self-management training, breathing training, and exercise or physical activation programs have proved particularly useful, whereas other essential or promising interventions, such as smoking cessation, dietary programs, perception and biofeedback training, and suggestive or expressive psychotherapy, require further, more rigorous evaluation. Given the high comorbidity with anxiety and mood disorders, further evaluation of illness-specific cognitive behavior therapy is of particular importance. Progress has also been made in devising community-based and culturally tailored intervention programs. Conclusion: In concert with an essential medication treatment, behavioral medicine treatment of asthma is moving closer toward an integrated biopsychosocial approach to disease management.

Effectiveness of and dropout from outpatient cognitive behavioral therapy for adult unipolar depression: A meta-analysis of nonrandomized effectiveness studies.,"Objective: The primary aim of this study was to assess the overall effectiveness of and dropout from individual and group outpatient cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) for adults with a primary diagnosis of unipolar depressive disorder in routine clinical practice. Method: We conducted a random effects meta-analysis of 34 nonrandomized effectiveness studies on outpatient individual and group CBT for adult unipolar depressive disorder. Standardized mean gain effect sizes are reported for end-of-treatment and 6-month follow-up effects for depression severity, dysfunctional cognitions, general anxiety, psychological distress, and functional impairment. The mean dropout rate from CBT is reported. We benchmarked our results against high-quality randomized controlled trials (RCTs). Results: Outpatient CBT was effective in reducing depressive severity in completer (d = 1.13) and intention-to-treat (ITT) samples (d = 1.06). Moderate to large posttreatment effect sizes (d = 0.67-0.88) were found for secondary outcomes. The weighted mean dropout rate was 24.63%. Posttreatment gains for depression were maintained at 6 months after completion of therapy. Effect sizes for depression were inferior to those of benchmark RCTs. Conclusions: Although clinical practice patients show lesser improvements in depressive symptoms than RCT patients, individual and group outpatient CBT can be effectively transported to routine clinical practice. The considerable treatment dropout rate, especially in individual CBT, must be improved. The small number of available studies and low quality of some reports stress the need for high-quality effectiveness studies.

Sudden gains in cognitive therapy and interpersonal therapy for social anxiety disorder.,"Objective: The present study examined the effects of sudden gains on treatment outcome in a randomized controlled trial including individual cognitive therapy (CT) and interpersonal therapy (IPT) for social anxiety disorder (SAD). Method: Participants were 67 individuals with SAD who received 16 treatment sessions. Symptom severity at each session was assessed using the Social Phobia Weekly Summary Scale (Clark et al., 2003). Results: Results indicate that 22.4% of participants experienced a sudden gain during treatment. Individuals with sudden gains had significantly lower social anxiety symptoms at post-treatment and follow-up compared to individuals without sudden gains. Sudden gains in CT and IPT had similar magnitudes, frequencies, and timings. However, sudden gains resulted in lower levels of post-treatment symptoms in CT compared to IPT. Cognitive changes did not precede sudden gains, but sudden gains resulted in cognitive changes. Conclusions: Sudden gains in CT and IPT for SAD are predictive of long-term outcome. In addition, the effect of sudden gains may be greater in CT compared to IPT. [Copyright American Psychological Association]",1364765273, Journal Article,2013

Sudden gains in CT and IPT had similar magnitudes, frequencies, and timings. However, sudden gains resulted in lower levels of post-treatment symptoms in CT compared to IPT. Cognitive changes did not precede sudden gains, but sudden gains resulted in cognitive changes. Sudden gains in CT and IPT for SAD are predictive of long-term outcome. In addition, the effect of sudden gains may be greater in CT compared to IPT.",1285207022, Feature,2013
Effectiveness of and dropout from outpatient cognitive behavioral therapy for adult unipolar depression: A meta-analysis of nonrandomized effectiveness studies,"  The primary aim of this study was to assess the overall effectiveness of and dropout from individual and group outpatient cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) for adults with a primary diagnosis of unipolar depressive disorder in routine clinical practice. We conducted a random effects meta-analysis of 34 nonrandomized effectiveness studies on outpatient individual and group CBT for adult unipolar depressive disorder. Standardized mean gain effect sizes are reported for end-of-treatment and 6-month follow-up effects for depression severity, dysfunctional cognitions, general anxiety, psychological distress, and functional impairment. The mean dropout rate from CBT is reported. We benchmarked our results against high-quality randomized controlled trials (RCTs). Outpatient CBT was effective in reducing depressive severity in completer (d = 1.13) and intention-to-treat (ITT) samples (d = 1.06). Moderate to large posttreatment effect sizes (d = 0.67-0.88) were found for secondary outcomes. The weighted mean dropout rate was 24.63%. Posttreatment gains for depression were maintained at 6 months after completion of therapy. Effect sizes for depression were inferior to those of benchmark RCTs. Although clinical practice patients show lesser improvements in depressive symptoms than RCT patients, individual and group outpatient CBT can be effectively transported to routine clinical practice. The considerable treatment dropout rate, especially in individual CBT, must be improved. The small number of available studies and low quality of some reports stress the need for high-quality effectiveness studies.",1285204169, Feature,2013
Comparative effectiveness of medication versus cognitive-behavioral therapy in a randomized controlled trial of low-income young minority women with depression.,"Objective: To examine whether there are latent trajectory classes in response to treatment and whether they moderate the effects of medication versus psychotherapy. Method: Data come from a 1-year randomized controlled trial of 267 low-income, young (M = 29 years), minority (44% Black, 50% Latina, 6% White) women with current major depression randomized to antidepressants, cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), or referral to community mental health services. Growth mixture modeling was used to determine whether there were differential effects of medication versus CBT. Depression was measured via the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (Hamilton, 1960). Results: We identified 2 latent trajectory classes. The first was characterized by severe depression at baseline. At 6 months, mean depression scores for the medication and CBT groups in this class were 13.9 and 14.9, respectively (difference not significant). At 12 months, mean depression scores were 16.4 and 11.0, respectively (p for difference = .04). The second class was characterized by moderate depression and anxiety at baseline. At 6 months, mean depression scores for the medication and CBT groups were 4.4 and 6.8, respectively (p for difference = .03). At 12 months, the mean depression scores were 7.1 and 7.8, respectively, and the difference was no longer significant. Conclusions: Among depressed women with moderate baseline depression and anxiety, medication was superior to CBT at 6 months, but the difference was not sustained at 1 year. Among women with severe depression, there was no significant treatment group difference at 6 months, but CBT was superior to medication at 1 year.

The effect of mindfulness-based therapy on symptoms of anxiety and depression in adult cancer patients and survivors: A systematic review and meta-analysis.,"Objective: The use of mindfulness-based therapy (MBT) in oncology settings has become increasingly popular, and research in the field has rapidly expanded. The objective was by means of a systematic review and meta-analysis to evaluate the current evidence for the effect of MBT on symptoms of anxiety and depression in adult cancer patients and survivors. Method: Electronic databases were searched, and researchers were contacted for further relevant studies. Twenty-two independent studies with a total of 1,403 participants were included. Studies were coded for quality (range: 0-4), and overall effect size analyses were performed separately for nonrandomized studies (K = 13, n = 448) and randomized controlled trials (RCTs; K = 9, n = 955). Effect sizes were combined using the random-effects model. Results: In the aggregated sample of nonrandomized studies (average quality score: 0.5), MBT was associated with significantly reduced symptoms of anxiety and depression from pre- to posttreatment corresponding to moderate effect sizes (Hedges\'s g) of 0.60 and 0.42, respectively. The pooled controlled effect sizes (Hedges\'s g) of RCTs (average quality score: 2.9) were 0.37 for anxiety symptoms (p < .001) and 0.44 for symptoms of depression (p < .001). These effect sizes appeared robust. Furthermore, in RCTs, MBT significantly improved mindfulness skills (Hedges\'s g = 0.39). Conclusion: While the overall quality of existing clinical trials varies considerably, there appears to be some positive evidence from relatively high-quality RCTs to support the use of MBT for cancer patients and survivors with symptoms of anxiety and depression.

"A comparison of cognitive bias modification for interpretation and computerized cognitive behavior therapy: Effects on anxiety, depression, attentional control, and interpretive bias.","Objective: Computerized cognitive behavioral therapy (cCBT) and cognitive bias modification for interpretation (CBM-I) both have demonstrated efficacy in alleviating social anxiety, but how they compare with each other has not been investigated. The present study tested the prediction that both interventions would reduce anxiety relative to a no-intervention comparison condition, but CBM-I would be particularly effective at modifying threat-related cognitive bias under high mental load. Method: Sixty-three primarily Caucasian adults (mean age = 22.7, SD = 5.87; 68.3% female) with high social anxiety, randomly allocated to 3 groups: CBM-I (n = 21), cCBT (n = 21), and a no-intervention control group (n = 21) provided complete data for analysis. Pre- and postintervention (4 sessions lasting 2 weeks, control participants only attended the pre-post sessions) self-report measures of anxiety, depression, attentional control, and threat-related interpretive bias were completed. In addition, interpretive bias under high versus low cognitive load was measured using the Scrambled Sentences Test. Results: Both CBM-I and cCBT groups reported significantly reduced levels of social anxiety, trait anxiety, and depression and improved attentional control, relative to the control group, with no clear superiority of either active intervention. Although both active conditions reduced negative bias on the Scrambled Sentences Test completed under mental load, CBM-I was significantly more effective at doing so. Conclusions: The results suggest that although not differing in therapeutic efficacy, CBM-I and cCBT might differ in the resilience of their effects when under mental load.

Cognitive reappraisal self-efficacy mediates the effects of individual cognitive-behavioral therapy for social anxiety disorder.,"Objective: To examine whether changes in cognitive reappraisal self-efficacy (CR-SE) mediate the effects of individually administered cognitive-behavioral therapy (I-CBT) for social anxiety disorder (SAD) on severity of social anxiety symptoms. Method: A randomized controlled trial in which 75 adult patients (21-55 years of age; 53% male; 57% Caucasian) with a principal diagnosis of generalized SAD were randomly assigned to 16 sessions of I-CBT (n = 38) or a wait-list control (WL) group (n = 37). All patients completed self-report inventories measuring CR-SE and social anxiety symptoms at baseline and post-I-CBT/post-WL, and I-CBT completers were also assessed at 1-year posttreatment. Results: Compared with WL, I-CBT resulted in greater increases in CR-SE and greater decreases in social anxiety. Increases in CR-SE during I-CBT mediated the effect of I-CBT on social anxiety. Gains achieved by patients receiving I-CBT were maintained 1-year posttreatment, and I-CBT-related increases in CR-SE were also associated with reduction in social anxiety at the 1-year follow-up. Conclusions: Increasing CR-SE may be an important mechanism by which I-CBT for SAD produces both immediate and long-term reductions in social anxiety.

Moderators and non-specific predictors of treatment outcome for anxiety disorders: A comparison of cognitive behavioral therapy to acceptance and commitment therapy.,"Objective: Understanding for whom, and under what conditions, treatments exert their greatest effects is essential for developing personalized medicine. Research investigating moderators of outcome among evidence-based treatments for anxiety disorders is lacking. The current study examined several theory-driven and atheoretical putative moderators of outcome in cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) and acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT). Method: Eighty-seven patients with a Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (4th ed., text rev.; DSM-IV-TR; American Psychiatric Association, 2000) anxiety disorder completed 12 sessions of ACT or CBT and were assessed with a self-report measure of anxiety at baseline, post-treatment, and 6- and 12-month follow-up assessments. Results: CBT outperformed ACT among those at moderate levels of baseline anxiety sensitivity, and among those with no comorbid mood disorder. ACT outperformed CBT among those with comorbid mood disorders. Higher baseline neuroticism was associated with poorer outcome across treatment conditions. Neither moderation nor general prediction was observed for baseline anxiety disorder comorbidity, race/ethnicity, gender, age, or baseline severity of the principal anxiety disorder. When including all randomized participants who completed the pre-treatment assessment (N = 121), a similar pattern was observed. Conclusions: Prescriptive recommendations for clinical practice and directions for future research are discussed. [Copyright American Psychological Association]",1364767932, Journal Article,2012
Does fear reactivity during exposure predict panic symptom reduction?,"Objective: Fear reactivity during exposure is a commonly used indicator of learning and overall therapy outcome. The objective of this study was to assess the predictive value of fear reactivity during exposure using multimodal indicators and an advanced analytical design. We also investigated the degree to which treatment condition (cognitive training vs. respiratory skill training) moderated fear reactivity and therapeutic outcome. Method: Thirty-four patients with panic disorder and agoraphobia completed a total of 123 in-vivo exposure sessions, comprising 3 weekly sessions and a 4th session 2 months following therapy completion. Sessions varied in length and phobic stimuli. Cardiorespiratory physiology (heart rate, carbon dioxide partial pressure [PCO2], respiration rate) and experiential symptoms (panic symptoms and anxiety) were assessed repeatedly throughout exposure sessions, in addition to weekly assessments of panic cognitions, avoidance, and functioning. Results: Panic symptomatology decreased substantially in both treatment conditions during therapy and follow-up. Significant cardiorespiratory and experiential reactivity was observed during all exposures, characterized by activation followed by reduction. Greater within-session activation of anxiety and panic symptoms was inversely related to improvement in panic symptoms severity, but neither physiological activation nor within- or between-session reduction of either physiological or experiential variables was predictive of outcome. No moderating effects of treatment condition were found. Conclusions: Fear activation and reduction during exposure are weak predictors of corrective learning and fear extinction. Clinical implications for exposure therapy and directions for future research are discussed. [Copyright American Psychological Association]",1364767704, Journal Article,2012

Further issues in determining the readability of self-report items: Comment on McHugh and Behar (2009).,"Objective: Issues regarding the readability of self-report assessment instruments, methods for establishing the reading ability level of respondents, and guidelines for development of scales designed for marginal readers have been inconsistently addressed in the literature. A recent study by McHugh and Behar (2009) provided new findings relevant to these issues. McHugh and Behar calculated indices of readability separately for the instructions and the item sets of 105 self-report measures of anxiety and depression. Results revealed substantial variability in readability among the measures, with most measures being written at or above the mean reading grade level in the United States. These results were consistent with those reported previously by Schinka and Borum (1993, 1994) in analyses of the readability of commonly used self-report psychopathology and personality inventories. In their discussion, McHugh and Behar addressed implications of their findings for clinical assessment and for scale development. Method: I expand on their comments by addressing the failure to consider vocabulary difficulty, a major shortcoming of readability indices that examine only text complexity. I demonstrate how vocabulary difficulty influences readability and discuss additional considerations and possible solutions for addressing the gap between scale readability and the reading skill level of the self-report respondent. Results and Conclusion: The work of McHugh and Behar clearly demonstrates that the issues of reading ability that arise in collecting self-report data are neither simple nor straightforward. Comments are offered to focus attention on the problems identified by their work. These problems will require additional effort on the part of researchers and clinicians in order to obtain reliable, valid estimates of clinical status.

A randomized clinical trial of mindfulness-based cognitive therapy versus unrestricted services for health anxiety (hypochondriasis).,"Objective: The efficacy and acceptability of existing psychological interventions for health anxiety (hypochondriasis) are limited. In the current study, the authors aimed to assess the impact of mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT) on health anxiety by comparing the impact of MBCT in addition to usual services (unrestricted services) with unrestricted services (US) alone. Method: The 74 participants were randomized to either MBCT in addition to US (n = 36) or US alone (n = 38). Participants were assessed prior to intervention (MBCT or US), immediately following the intervention, and 1 year postintervention. In addition to independent assessments of diagnostic status, standardized self-report measures and assessor ratings of severity and distress associated with the diagnosis of hypochondriasis were used. Results: In the intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis (N = 74), MBCT participants had significantly lower health anxiety than US participants, both immediately following the intervention (Cohen's d = 0.48) and at 1-year follow-up (d = 0.48). The per-protocol (PP) analysis (n = 68) between groups effect size was d = 0.49 at postintervention and d = 0.62 at 1-year follow-up. Mediational analysis showed that change in mindfulness mediated the group changes in health anxiety symptoms. Significantly fewer participants allocated to MBCT than to US met criteria for the diagnosis of hypochondriasis, both immediately following the intervention period (ITT 50.0% vs. 78.9%; PP 47.1% vs. 78.4%) and at 1-year follow-up (ITT 36.1% vs. 76.3%; PP 28.1% vs. 75.0%).

Refinement of a brief anxiety sensitivity reduction intervention.,"Objective: Anxiety disorders are the most prevalent psychiatric disorders in the United States and result in substantial burden to the individual and society. Although effective treatments for anxiety disorders have been developed, there has been substantially less focus on interventions aimed at the amelioration of anxiety-related risk and maintenance factors. Anxiety sensitivity (AS) is a well-established, malleable risk and maintenance factor for panic disorder and other psychopathology. The aim of the current investigation was to enhance the efficacy of AS treatment through the refinement of a previously validated intervention. Method: This 1-session intervention utilized psychoeducation and interoceptive exposure to target AS and was compared with a health-focused control intervention among a nontreatment seeking sample (N = 104) of individuals with elevated AS. Results: Study findings indicate that the active treatment group demonstrated significantly greater reductions in AS than the control group at posttreatment and across the 1-month study period. These treatment gains were seen across the ASI subscales. A Month 6 follow-up assessment indicated that the treatment group retained the majority of their AS reduction, whereas the control group retained their elevated AS scores. The intervention responses of participants meeting Axis I diagnostic criteria did not differ from the responses of those without a current diagnosis. Conclusions: Despite the brevity of the treatment intervention, findings demonstrate that it resulted in substantial reductions in AS that were largely maintained 6 months posttreatment. Anxiety treatment and prevention implications are discussed. [Copyright American Psychological Association]",1364766031, Journal Article,2012
The relationship between experiences of discrimination and mental health among lesbians and gay men: An examination of internalized homonegativity and rejection sensitivity as potential mechanisms.,"Objective: The current study used path analysis to examine potential mechanisms through which experiences of discrimination influence depressive and social anxiety symptoms. Method: The sample included 218 lesbians and 249 gay men (total N = 467) who participated in an online survey about minority stress and mental health. The proposed model included 2 potential mediators -- internalized homonegativity and rejection sensitivity -- as well as a culturally relevant antecedent to experiences of discrimination -- childhood gender nonconformity. Results: Results indicated that the data fit the model well, supporting the mediating roles of internalized homonegativity and rejection sensitivity in the associations between experiences of discrimination and symptoms of depression and social anxiety. Results also supported the role of childhood gender nonconformity as an antecedent to experiences of discrimination. Although there were not significant gender differences in the overall model fit, some of the associations within the model were significantly stronger for gay men than lesbians. Conclusions: These findings suggest potential mechanisms through which experiences of discrimination influence well-being among sexual minorities, which has important implications for research and clinical practice with these populations.

Randomized clinical trial of cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) versus acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT) for mixed anxiety disorders.,"Objective: Randomized comparisons of acceptance-based treatments with traditional cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) for anxiety disorders are lacking. To address this gap, we compared acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT) to CBT for heterogeneous anxiety disorders. Method: One hundred twenty-eight individuals (52% female, mean age = 38, 33% minority) with 1 or more DSM-IV anxiety disorders began treatment following randomization to CBT or ACT; both treatments included behavioral exposure. Assessments at pre-treatment, post-treatment, and 6- and 12-month follow-up measured anxiety-specific (principal disorder Clinical Severity Ratings [CSRs], Anxiety Sensitivity Index, Penn State Worry Questionnaire, Fear Questionnaire avoidance) and non-anxiety-specific (Quality of Life Index [QOLI], Acceptance and Action Questionnaire-16 [AAQ]) outcomes. Treatment adherence, therapist competency ratings, treatment credibility, and co-occurring mood and anxiety disorders were investigated. Results: CBT and ACT improved similarly across all outcomes from pre- to post-treatment. During follow-up, ACT showed steeper linear CSR improvements than CBT (p< .05, d = 1.26), and at 12-month follow-up, ACT showed lower CSRs than CBT among completers (p < .05, d = 1.10). At 12-month follow-up, ACT reported higher AAQ than CBT (p = .08, d = 0.42; completers: p< .05, d = 0.56), whereas CBT reported higher QOLI than ACT (p< .05, d = 0.42). Attrition and comorbidity improvements were similar; ACT used more non-study psychotherapy at 6-month follow-up. Therapist adherence and competency were good; treatment credibility was higher in CBT. Conclusions: Overall improvement was similar between ACT and CBT, indicating that ACT is a highly viable treatment for anxiety disorders.

These problems will require additional effort on the part of researchers and clinicians in order to obtain reliable, valid estimates of clinical status.",1082363090, Commentary,2012
Does fear reactivity during exposure predict panic symptom reduction?,"  Fear reactivity during exposure is a commonly used indicator of learning and overall therapy outcome. The objective of this study was to assess the predictive value of fear reactivity during exposure using multimodal indicators and an advanced analytical design. We also investigated the degree to which treatment condition (cognitive training vs. respiratory skill training) moderated fear reactivity and therapeutic outcome. Thirty-four patients with panic disorder and agoraphobia completed a total of 123 in-vivo exposure sessions, comprising 3 weekly sessions and a 4th session 2 months following therapy completion. Sessions varied in length and phobic stimuli. Cardiorespiratory physiology (heart rate, carbon dioxide partial pressure [PCO2], respiration rate) and experiential symptoms (panic symptoms and anxiety) were assessed repeatedly throughout exposure sessions, in addition to weekly assessments of panic cognitions, avoidance, and functioning. Panic symptomatology decreased substantially in both treatment conditions during therapy and follow-up. Significant cardiorespiratory and experiential reactivity was observed during all exposures, characterized by activation followed by reduction. Greater within-session activation of anxiety and panic symptoms was inversely related to improvement in panic symptoms severity, but neither physiological activation nor within- or between-session reduction of either physiological or experiential variables was predictive of outcome. No moderating effects of treatment condition were found. Fear activation and reduction during exposure are weak predictors of corrective learning and fear extinction. Clinical implications for exposure therapy and directions for future research are discussed.",1082363082, Feature,2012
Refinement of a brief anxiety sensitivity reduction intervention,"  Anxiety disorders are the most prevalent psychiatric disorders in the United States and result in substantial burden to the individual and society. Although effective treatments for anxiety disorders have been developed, there has been substantially less focus on interventions aimed at the amelioration of anxiety-related risk and maintenance factors. Anxiety sensitivity (AS) is a well-established, malleable risk and maintenance factor for panic disorder and other psychopathology. The aim of the current investigation was to enhance the efficacy of AS treatment through the refinement of a previously validated intervention. This 1-session intervention utilized psychoeducation and interoceptive exposure to target AS and was compared with a health-focused control intervention among a nontreatment seeking sample (N = 104) of individuals with elevated AS. Study findings indicate that the active treatment group demonstrated significantly greater reductions in AS than the control group at posttreatment and across the 1-month study period. These treatment gains were seen across the ASI subscales. A Month 6 follow-up assessment indicated that the treatment group retained the majority of their AS reduction, whereas the control group retained their elevated AS scores. The intervention responses of participants meeting Axis I diagnostic criteria did not differ from the responses of those without a current diagnosis. Despite the brevity of the treatment intervention, findings demonstrate that it resulted in substantial reductions in AS that were largely maintained 6 months posttreatment. Anxiety treatment and prevention implications are discussed.",1082362468, Feature,2012
Moderators and non-specific predictors of treatment outcome for anxiety disorders: A comparison of cognitive behavioral therapy to acceptance and commitment therapy,"  Understanding for whom, and under what conditions, treatments exert their greatest effects is essential for developing personalized medicine. Research investigating moderators of outcome among evidence-based treatments for anxiety disorders is lacking. The current study examined several theory-driven and atheoretical putative moderators of outcome in cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) and acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT). Eighty-seven patients with a Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (4th ed., text rev.; DSM-IV-TR; American Psychiatric Association, 2000) anxiety disorder completed 12 sessions of ACT or CBT and were assessed with a self-report measure of anxiety at baseline, post-treatment, and 6- and 12-month follow-up assessments. CBT outperformed ACT among those at moderate levels of baseline anxiety sensitivity, and among those with no comorbid mood disorder. ACT outperformed CBT among those with comorbid mood disorders. Higher baseline neuroticism was associated with poorer outcome across treatment conditions. Neither moderation nor general prediction was observed for baseline anxiety disorder comorbidity, race/ethnicity, gender, age, or baseline severity of the principal anxiety disorder. When including all randomized participants who completed the pre-treatment assessment (N = 121), a similar pattern was observed. Prescriptive recommendations for clinical practice and directions for future research are discussed.",1082362466, Feature,2012
Randomized clinical trial of cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) versus acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT) for mixed anxiety disorders,"  Randomized comparisons of acceptance-based treatments with traditional cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) for anxiety disorders are lacking. To address this gap, we compared acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT) to CBT for heterogeneous anxiety disorders. One hundred twenty-eight individuals (52% female, mean age = 38, 33% minority) with 1 or more DSM-IV anxiety disorders began treatment following randomization to CBT or ACT; both treatments included behavioral exposure. Assessments at pre-treatment, post-treatment, and 6- and 12-month follow-up measured anxiety-specific (principal disorder Clinical Severity Ratings [CSRs], Anxiety Sensitivity Index, Penn State Worry Questionnaire, Fear Questionnaire avoidance) and non-anxiety-specific (Quality of Life Index [QOLI], Acceptance and Action Questionnaire-16 [AAQ]) outcomes. Treatment adherence, therapist competency ratings, treatment credibility, and co-occurring mood and anxiety disorders were investigated. CBT and ACT improved similarly across all outcomes from pre- to post-treatment. During follow-up, ACT showed steeper linear CSR improvements than CBT ( p &lt; .05, d = 1.26), and at 12-month follow-up, ACT showed lower CSRs than CBT among completers (p &lt; .05, d = 1.10). At 12-month follow-up, ACT reported higher AAQ than CBT ( p = .08, d = 0.42; completers: p &lt; .05, d = 0.56), whereas CBT reported higher QOLI than ACT ( p &lt; .05, d = 0.42). Attrition and comorbidity improvements were similar; ACT used more non-study psychotherapy at 6-month follow-up. Therapist adherence and competency were good; treatment credibility was higher in CBT. Overall improvement was similar between ACT and CBT, indicating that ACT is a highly viable treatment for anxiety disorders.",1082362463, Feature,2012
The relationship between experiences of discrimination and mental health among lesbians and gay men: An examination of internalized homonegativity and rejection sensitivity as potential mechanisms,"  The current study used path analysis to examine potential mechanisms through which experiences of discrimination influence depressive and social anxiety symptoms. The sample included 218 lesbians and 249 gay men (total N = 467) who participated in an online survey about minority stress and mental health. The proposed model included 2 potential mediators -- internalized homonegativity and rejection sensitivity -- as well as a culturally relevant antecedent to experiences of discrimination -- childhood gender nonconformity. Results indicated that the data fit the model well, supporting the mediating roles of internalized homonegativity and rejection sensitivity in the associations between experiences of discrimination and symptoms of depression and social anxiety. Results also supported the role of childhood gender nonconformity as an antecedent to experiences of discrimination. Although there were not significant gender differences in the overall model fit, some of the associations within the model were significantly stronger for gay men than lesbians. These findings suggest potential mechanisms through which experiences of discrimination influence well-being among sexual minorities, which has important implications for research and clinical practice with these populations.",1082325142, Feature,2012
Threat reappraisal as a mediator of symptom change in cognitive-behavioral treatment of anxiety disorders: A systematic review.,"Objective: Identifying mediators of therapeutic change is important to the development of interventions and augmentation strategies. Threat reappraisal is considered a key mediator underlying the effects of cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) for anxiety disorders. The present study systematically reviewed the evidence for the threat reappraisal mediation hypothesis. Method: In our review, we included studies that (a) investigated the threat reappraisal mediation hypothesis; (b) included adults with an anxiety disorder diagnosis; (c) used a longitudinal design; and (d) did not report on previously published findings (to avoid the inclusion of multiple reports of the same data). After data extraction, we made review-specific quality judgments for each study using the following a priori criteria informed by mediation theory: (a) demonstrated statistical mediation; (b) demonstrated that CBT caused threat reappraisal; (c) demonstrated that threat reappraisal caused anxiety reduction; and (d) demonstrated specificity of the threat reappraisal-anxiety reduction relation. Results: Of the 2,296 studies we identified, 25 met inclusion criteria. Of these studies, 56% tested and 52% established statistical mediation, 52% tested and 28% established CBT as a cause of threat reappraisal, 28% tested and 24% established threat reappraisal as a cause of anxiety reduction, and 44% tested and 36% established specificity of the threat reappraisal-anxiety reduction relation. Conclusions: While threat reappraisal is related to anxiety symptom improvement with CBT, there are few extant studies that meet most of the criteria necessary to conclusively demonstrate that it causes symptom improvement in CBT and that it is not a proxy for other third variables. Recommendations for future research in this area are discussed. [Copyright American Psychological Association]",1364766979, Journal Article,2012
The role of early symptom trajectories and pretreatment variables in predicting treatment response to cognitive behavioral therapy.,"Objective: Research has focused on 2 different approaches to answering the question, ""Which clients will respond to cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) for depression?"" One approach focuses on rates of symptom change within the 1st few weeks of treatment, whereas the 2nd approach looks to pretreatment client variables (e.g., hopelessness) to identify clients who are more or less likely to respond. The current study simultaneously examines these 2 lines of research (i.e., early symptom change and pretreatment variables) on the prediction of treatment outcome to determine the incremental utility of each potential predictor. Method: The sample consists of 173 clients (66.47% female, 92.49% Caucasian), 18-64 years of age (M = 27.94, SD = 11.42), receiving treatment for depression and anxiety disorders in a CBT-oriented psychology training clinic. Results: The rate of change in depressive symptom severity from baseline over the 1st 5 treatment sessions significantly predicted treatment outcome. A contemplative orientation to change and medication status positively predicted early symptom change, whereas student status negatively predicted early symptom change. Higher levels of baseline anxiety, precontemplative readiness to change, and global functioning predicted lower levels of depressive symptom severity at termination. Conclusions: The findings suggest achieving rapid symptom change early in treatment may be integral to overall success. As such, therapists may wish to target factors such as readiness to change to potentially maximize rapid rate of symptom change and subsequent treatment outcome.

Mediators of the association of major depressive syndrome and anxiety syndrome with postpartum smoking relapse.,"Objective: Based on conceptual models of addiction and affect regulation, this study examined the mechanisms linking current major depressive syndrome (MDS) and anxiety syndrome (AS) to postpartum smoking relapse. Method: Data were collected in a randomized clinical trial from 251 women who quit smoking during pregnancy. Simple and multiple mediation models of the relations of MDS and AS with postpartum relapse were examined using linear regression, continuation ratio logit models, and a bootstrapping procedure to test the indirect effects. Results: Both MDS and AS significantly predicted postpartum smoking relapse. After adjusting for MDS, AS significantly predicted relapse. However, after adjusting for AS, MDS no longer predicted relapse. Situationally based self-efficacy, expectancies of controlling negative affect by means other than smoking, and various dimensions of primary and secondary tobacco dependence individually mediated the effect of both MDS and AS on relapse. In multiple mediation models, self-efficacy in negative/affective situations significantly mediated the effect of MDS and AS on relapse. Conclusions: The findings underscore the negative impact of depression and anxiety on postpartum smoking relapse and suggest that the effects of MDS on postpartum relapse may be largely explained by comorbid AS. The current investigation provided mixed support for affect regulation models of addiction. Cognitive and tobacco dependence-related aspects of negative and positive reinforcement significantly mediated the relationship of depression and anxiety with relapse, whereas affect and stress did not. The findings emphasize the unique role of low agency with respect to abstaining from smoking in negative affective situations as a key predictor of postpartum smoking relapse.

A randomized controlled trial of internet-delivered cognitive behavior therapy and acceptance and commitment therapy in the treatment of tinnitus.,"Objective: Our aim in this randomized controlled trial was to investigate the effects on global tinnitus severity of 2 Internet-delivered psychological treatments, acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT) and cognitive behavior therapy (CBT), in guided self-help format. Method: Ninety-nine participants (mean age = 48.5 years; 43% female) who were significantly distressed by tinnitus were recruited from the community. Participants were randomly assigned to CBT (n = 32), ACT (n = 35), or a control condition (monitored Internet discussion forum; n = 32), and they were assessed with standardized self-report measures (Tinnitus Handicap Inventory; Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale; Quality of Life Inventory; Perceived Stress Scale; Tinnitus Acceptance Questionnaire) at pre-, posttreatment (8 weeks), and 1-year follow-up. Results: Mixed-effects linear regression analysis of all randomized participants showed significant effects on the primary outcome (Tinnitus Handicap Inventory) for CBT and for ACT compared with control at posttreatment (95% CI [-17.03, -2.94], d = 0.70, and 95% CI [-16.29, -2.53], d = 0.68, respectively). Within-group effects were substantial from pretreatment through 1-year-follow-up for both treatments (95% CI [-44.65, -20.45], d = 1.34), with no significant difference between treatments (95% CI [-14.87, 11.21], d = 0.16). Conclusions: Acceptance-based procedures may be a viable alternative to traditional CBT techniques in the management of tinnitus. The Internet can improve access to psychological interventions for tinnitus. [Copyright American Psychological Association]",1364764720, Journal Article,2012

Facets of pejorative self-processing in complicated grief,"Objective: Complicated grief (CG) has been proposed as a psychiatric response to bereavement distinct from established mood and anxiety disorder diagnoses. Little is known about the nature of cognitive-affective processing in CG, nor any similarities or differences compared with the processing profiles associated with other emotional disorders. Three studies therefore investigated 3 broad facets of negative self-processing associated with either elevated symptoms of, or diagnosis of, CG -- namely, self-related attributions or blame, self-devaluation, and cognitions about the future self. Method: These self-processing domains were assessed using a variety of self-report and scenario-based measures either linked specifically to the bereavement or more general in their focus. Study 1 used a correlational design in a community bereaved sample. Study 2 employed an extreme-groups approach looking at individuals high versus low in CG symptoms, and Study 3 compared those with a CG diagnosis to healthy bereaved controls. Results: The data revealed a profile of processing in CG characterized by significant relationships between CG symptoms or diagnosis and both self-devaluation and negative self-related cognitions about the future, but the data provided no support for a similar relationship with negative self-related attributions. Conclusions: These findings extend our understanding of self-related cognitive processing in CG. They also suggest that CG is characterized by a cognitive-affective processing profile that is distinct from that associated with other disorders, notably major depression, in the literature. This has potential implications for the psychological treatment of CG and for its nosological status as a post-loss syndrome distinct from depression.

Anxiety and depression in breast cancer survivors of different sexual orientations.,"Objective: We conducted a study comparing anxiety and depression by sexual orientation in long-term breast cancer survivors, testing the hypothesis that sexual minority women (e.g., lesbian and bisexual women) have greater levels of anxiety and depression. Method: From a state cancer registry, we recruited 257 heterosexual and 69 sexual minority women with a diagnosis of primary, nonmetastatic breast cancer. To increase the number of sexual minority participants, we used convenience recruitment methods and obtained an additional 112 sexual minority women who fit the same eligibility criteria as did the registry-derived sample. Using a telephone survey, we assessed clinical and demographic characteristics of the participants and the outcomes of anxiety and depression using the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (Zigmond & Snaith, 1983). Results: We did not confirm our study hypothesis but found that sexual orientation is associated with anxiety and depression through interactions with demographic and clinical factors. Younger age and lower socioeconomic status are associated with worse anxiety and depression. These factors explain less than 20% of the variance in anxiety and depression. Conclusions: This sample of long-term breast cancer survivors shows low levels of psychological morbidity, while some sexual minority survivors are more depressed. Future research should examine explanatory factors to account for the better-than-expected psychological rehabilitation of sexual minority survivors.

Do anxiety-disordered children need to come into the clinic for efficacious treatment?,"Objective: This study compared 3 experimental conditions: wait-list, therapist-supported bibliotherapy, and individual therapy, in the treatment of child anxiety. Method: Participants were 55 children (25 girls and 30 boys), aged 7 to 14 years diagnosed with an anxiety disorder, and their parents. Families were assigned using a modified random assignment process to 1 of the 3 conditions. The intervention evaluated in the 2 active treatment conditions was a family-focused, cognitive-behavioral program. Results: At posttreatment, participants in both treatment conditions had improved significantly on both diagnostic and questionnaire outcome measures compared with participants in the wait-list condition, with no differences demonstrated between the treatment conditions. Thus, at posttreatment, 0% of children in the wait-list condition were anxiety diagnosis free, compared with 95% in the therapist-supported bibliotherapy condition and 78.3% in the individual therapy condition. There was no significant difference between diagnostic status at posttreatment between the 2 treatment conditions. Participants assigned to a treatment condition were reassessed at 3-month and 6-month follow-up. Treatment gains were maintained in both conditions across the follow-up period. Conclusion: In light of the fact that more than 80% of anxiety-disordered children never receive treatment, these data suggest that therapist-supported bibliotherapy represents a cost-effective means of reaching a greater number of anxious children.

Generalized anxiety disorder: A comparison of symptom change in adults receiving cognitive-behavioral therapy or applied relaxation.,"Objective: Generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) is characterized by excessive worry and somatic symptoms of anxiety (e.g., restlessness, muscle tension). Several psychological treatments lead to significant reductions in GAD symptoms by posttreatment. However, little is known about how GAD symptoms change over time. Our main goal was to examine how GAD symptoms changed in relation to one another during 2 distinct but efficacious psychological treatments: cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) and applied relaxation (AR). Specifically, we asked whether change in worry accounted for change over time in somatic anxiety (or the reverse) to the same degree in CBT and AR. Method: We examined data from 57 individuals with GAD enrolled in a randomized controlled trial. Self-report measures of worry and somatic anxiety were obtained daily during treatment. Results: Although the direction of influence between changes in worry and somatic anxiety was bidirectional to some extent in both treatments, a significant difference was also observed: Change in worry accounted for subsequent change in somatic anxiety to a greater extent in CBT than in AR. Conclusions: These findings allowed us to identify differences in a mechanism of change in GAD symptoms during 2 treatments and to provide some support for the idea that similarly efficacious treatments may produce symptom change via different mechanisms in a manner that is consistent with the theoretical rationales on which the treatments are based.

Interpretation training in individuals with generalized social anxiety disorder: A randomized controlled trial.,"Objective: To examine the efficacy of a multisession computerized interpretation modification program (IMP) in the treatment of generalized social anxiety disorder (GSAD). Method: The sample comprised 49 individuals meeting diagnostic criteria for GSAD who were enrolled in a randomized, double-blind placebo-controlled trial comparing IMP (n = 23) with an interpretation control condition (ICC; n = 26). The interpretation training procedures comprised a word-sentence association task in which participants decided whether a word implying a threatening or benign meaning was related to an ambiguous social scenario. In the IMP group, participants were reinforced for interpreting ambiguous social information in a nonthreatening and more benign manner. In the ICC group, participants were reinforced with equal frequency for interpreting ambiguous social information in either a threatening or benign manner. Results: Intent-to-treat and completer analyses revealed that IMP significantly decreased threat interpretations and increased benign interpretations from pre- to post-assessment relative to the ICC group. Moreover, IMP participants displayed significantly larger reductions in clinician-rated social anxiety symptoms and functional impairment as well as self-reported trait anxiety and depression relative to ICC participants. Groups did not differ on change in self-rated social anxiety symptoms. Participants no longer meeting DSM-IV criteria for GSAD at post-assessment were 65% in IMP and 13% in ICC. Conclusions: These results suggest that computerized interpretation training procedures may be beneficial for treating social anxiety disorder.

To increase the number of sexual minority participants, we used convenience recruitment methods and obtained an additional 112 sexual minority women who fit the same eligibility criteria as did the registry-derived sample. Using a telephone survey, we assessed clinical and demographic characteristics of the participants and the outcomes of anxiety and depression using the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (Zigmond &amp; Snaith, 1983). We did not confirm our study hypothesis but found that sexual orientation is associated with anxiety and depression through interactions with demographic and clinical factors. Younger age and lower socioeconomic status are associated with worse anxiety and depression. These factors explain less than 20% of the variance in anxiety and depression. This sample of long-term breast cancer survivors shows low levels of psychological morbidity, while some sexual minority survivors are more depressed. Future research should examine explanatory factors to account for the better-than-expected psychological rehabilitation of sexual minority survivors.",1018051135, Feature,2012
"Social capital, acculturation, mental health, and perceived access to services among Mexican American women.","Objective: We examined whether individual-level social capital -- the intangible resources in a community available through membership in social networks or other social structures and perceived trust in the community -- was associated with acculturation, depression and anxiety symptoms, and perceived access to services among women of Mexican ancestry. Method: Recruited through venue-based targeted sampling in King County, Washington, 205 women of Mexican descent ages 18 to 64 years who differed in socioeconomic status and nativity completed a cross-sectional survey. Half completed the survey in Spanish and half in English. Structural equation modeling was used for model testing. Results: Social capital increased with level of acculturation and was negatively related to depression and anxiety; it had no direct association with perceived access to services. Social capital mediated the relation between acculturation and both depression and anxiety symptoms. Acculturation had no direct association with psychological distress but was directly associated with perceived access to services. This community sample of women reported high levels of psychological distress, with 20% to 26% of women meeting diagnostic criteria for depression or anxiety. Conclusions: Social capital can be assessed at the individual level, increases with acculturation, and may be a potential target for interventions to improve mental health among Mexican American women residing in the United States.

Treatment of comorbid attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder and anxiety in children: A multiple baseline design analysis.,"Objective: The present study evaluated a 10-week psychosocial treatment designed specifically for children with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and a comorbid anxiety disorder. Method: Using a nonconcurrent multiple baseline design, the authors treated 8 children ages 8-12 with ADHD, combined type, and at least 1 of 3 major anxiety disorders (separation anxiety disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, social phobia). The integrated treatment protocol involved parent management training for ADHD and family-based cognitive-behavioral therapy for anxiety. Pretreatment assessments included semistructured diagnostic interviews and other standardized measures to determine study eligibility. Children were randomized to 1 of 3 baseline control conditions (i.e., 2, 3, or 4 weeks) and subsequently treated in a university-based psychosocial treatment clinic. Weekly assessments of ADHD and anxiety disorder symptoms occurred throughout treatment and comprehensive assessments were obtained at pretreatment, 1-week posttreatment, and 6-months posttreatment. Results: Single-case results supported greater success in the treatment phase relative to the baseline phase for both ADHD and anxiety symptoms, and ADHD and anxiety symptoms appeared to change concurrently. Pre-post group analyses revealed significant and clinically meaningful improvements in ADHD and anxiety symptoms at 1-week posttreatment, but only anxiety symptoms moved into the subclinical range. At 6-months follow-up, treatment effects were maintained with new movement into the subclinical range for ADHD. Conclusions: The present study provides initial data on an integrated treatment protocol for ADHD and anxiety. Further replication and evaluation are needed. Implications of the findings are discussed. [Copyright American Psychological Association]",1023094405, Journal Article,2012
The effect of perceived child anxiety status on parental latency to intervene with anxious and nonanxious youth.,"Objective: We examined the effect of perceived child anxiety status on parental latency to intervene with anxious and nonanxious youth. Method: Parents (68) of anxiety-disordered (PAD) and nonanxiety-disordered (PNAD; 56) children participated. Participants listened and responded to an audio vignette of a parent-child interaction: Half were told the child was anxious, and half were given a neutral description. Participants completed measures of anxiety and emotional responding before and after the audio vignette and signaled when the mother on the vignette should accommodate the child. Results: Whereas PNAD responded significantly faster when provided with neutral information about the child than when told the child was anxious, PAD did not differ in response latency. However, PAD exhibited a significant increase in state anxiety and negative affect and a decrease in positive affect after the vignette, whereas PNAD did not. Conclusions: Results suggest that PNAD are more flexible and adaptable in their parenting behavior than PAD and that the greater anxiety and emotional lability of PAD may influence their parenting. Suggestions for research are discussed. [Copyright American Psychological Association]",1023090897, Journal Article,2012

What cognitive behavioral techniques do therapists report using when delivering cognitive behavioral therapy for the eating disorders?,"Objective: Clinicians commonly ""drift"" away from using proven therapeutic techniques. This study examined the degree to which such drift occurs among cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) clinicians working with a specific clinical population -- adults with eating disorders. Method: The study used a correlational design. The participants were 80 qualified clinicians (69 women, 11 men; mean age = 39.2 years, range = 23-62 years) who routinely offered what they described as CBT to adults with eating disorders. Each clinician detailed whether and how often he or she used different cognitive behavioral techniques when delivering CBT to such patients, and each completed the anxiety scale of the Brief Symptom Inventory (Derogatis, 1983). Results: Implementation of specific CBT techniques was far lower than protocols would suggest, particularly for clinicians who were anxious, older, or more experienced in working with the eating disorders (p < .05, in all cases). The use of treatment manuals was associated with greater use of recommended CBT techniques (p < .05, in all cases). Cluster analysis showed that clinicians fell into three types -- behavior, motivation, and mindfulness oriented. Conclusions: These findings need to be extended to other therapies and other disorders, but they indicate the need for stronger training and closer supervision if clinicians are to give patients the best chance of recovery. They demonstrate that clinicians' use of the label CBT is not a reliable indicator of the therapy that is being offered.

Marital discord and coronary artery disease: A comparison of behaviorally defined discrete groups.,"Objective: Marital difficulties can confer risk of coronary heart disease, as in a study of outwardly healthy couples (T. W. Smith et al., 2011) where behavioral ratings of low affiliation and high control during marital disagreements were associated with asymptomatic coronary artery disease (CAD). However, taxometric studies suggest that marital discord is more accurately represented by discrete groups, rather than continuous dimensions. To determine if a categorical representation of marital discord was also related to CAD, discordant and nondiscordant groups were identified via cluster analysis in further analyses of the T. W. Smith et al. (2011) study. Method: One hundred fifty healthy couples (M age = 63.5) completed a marital disagreement discussion, self-reports of anxiety and anger during the disagreement, and self-report measures of marital adjustment. CAD was measured as coronary artery calcification (CAC) via computed tomography scans. Results: In a 2-group cluster solution, 31% of couples were characterized as discordant, with higher levels of hostility and dominance and lower levels of warmth compared with the nondiscordant group. Discordant couples reported lower marital adjustment and greater negative affect during the discussion. Controlling biomedical and behavioral risk factors, discordant couples had greater CAC (p = .029, chi2 = .035). Discordant and nondiscordant groups defined via self-reported marital adjustment did not differ in CAC (p = .17, chi2 = .014). Conclusions: Marital discord defined categorically and with behavioral observations was associated with greater levels of asymptomatic CAD. Marital discord is associated with higher risk at early stages of coronary heart disease, but commonly used self-reports may underestimate this risk.

Empirically derived subtypes of lifetime anxiety disorders: Developmental and clinical correlates in U.S. Adolescents.,"Objective: The current study examined the sex- and age-specific structure and comorbidity of lifetime anxiety disorders among U.S. adolescents. Method: The sample consisted of 2,539 adolescents (1,505 females and 1,034 males) from the National Comorbidity Survey-Adolescent Supplement who met criteria for Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (4th ed., text rev. [DSM-IV-TR]) lifetime anxiety disorders (American Psychiatric Association, 2000). Adolescents ranged in age from 13 to 18 years (M = 15.2 years, SE = 0.08 years) and were 39% non-White. Multiple-group latent class analysis was conducted by adolescent sex and age to identify subgroups of adolescents with similar anxiety disorder profiles. Developmental and clinical correlates of empirically derived classes were also examined to assess the nomological validity of identified subgroups. Results: A 7-class solution provided the best fit to the data, with classes defined primarily by one rather than multiple anxiety disorders. Results also indicated that classes displayed similar diagnostic profiles across age, but varied by sex. Classes characterized by multiple anxiety disorders were consistently associated with a greater degree of persistence, clinical severity, impairment, and comorbidity with other DSM-IV-TR psychiatric disorders. Conclusions: The presentation of lifetime anxiety disorders among adolescents and the observation of unique correlates of specific classes provide initial evidence for the utility of individual DSM-IV-TR anxiety disorder categories. Although findings of the present study should be considered preliminary, results emphasize the potential value of early intervention and gender-specific conceptualization and treatment of anxiety disorders.

Sudden gains during psychological treatments of anxiety and depression: A meta-analysis.,"Objective: The present study quantitatively reviewed the literature on sudden gains in psychological treatments for anxiety and depression. The authors examined the short- and long-term effects of sudden gains on treatment outcome as well as moderators of these effects. Method: The authors conducted a literature search using PubMed, PsycINFO, the Cochrane Library, and manual searches. The meta-analysis was based on 16 studies and included 1,104 participants receiving psychological treatment for major depressive disorder or an anxiety disorder. Results: Effect size estimates suggest that sudden gains had a moderate effect on primary outcome measures at posttreatment (Hedges's g = 0.62) and follow-up (Hedges's g = 0.56). These effect sizes were robust and unrelated to publication year or number of treatment sessions. The effect size of sudden gains in cognitive-behavioral therapy was higher (Hedges's g = 0.75) than in other treatments (Hedges's g = 0.23). Conclusions: These results suggest that sudden gains are associated with short-term and long-term improvements in depression and anxiety, especially in cognitive-behavioral therapy.

Brief Behavioral Activation and Problem-Solving Therapy for Depressed Breast Cancer Patients: Randomized Trial,"Major depression is the most common psychiatric disorder among breast cancer patients and is associated with substantial impairment. Although some research has explored the utility of psychotherapy with breast cancer patients, only 2 small trials have investigated the potential benefits of behavior therapy among patients with well-diagnosed depression. In a primarily Caucasian, well-educated sample of women (age = 55.4 years, SD = 11.9) diagnosed with breast cancer and major depression (n = 80), this study was a randomized clinical trial testing the efficacy of 8 sessions of behavioral activation treatment for depression (BATD) compared to problem-solving therapy. Primary outcome measures assessed depression, environmental reward, anxiety, quality of life, social support, and medical outcomes. Across both treatments, results revealed strong treatment integrity, excellent patient satisfaction with treatment protocols, and low patient attrition (19%). Intent-to-treat analyses suggested both treatments were efficacious, with both evidencing significant pre-post treatment gains across all outcome measures. Across both treatments, gains were associated with strong effect sizes, and based on response and remission criteria, a reliable change index, and numbers-needed-to-treat analyses, approximately 3/4 of patients exhibited clinically significant improvement. No significant group differences were found at posttreatment. Treatment gains were maintained at 12-month follow-up, with some support for stronger maintenance of gains in the BATD group. BATD and problem-solving interventions represent practical interventions that may improve psychological outcomes and quality of life among depressed breast cancer patients.

Remission After Acute Treatment in Children and Adolescents With Anxiety Disorders: Findings From the CAMS,"To report on remission rates in anxious youth who participated in the Child/Adolescent Anxiety Multimodal Study (CAMS). The CAMS, a multisite clinical trial, randomized 488 children and adolescents (ages 7-17 years; 79% Caucasian; 50% female) with separation, social, and/or generalized anxiety disorder to a 12-week treatment of sertraline (SRT), cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), their combination (COMB), or clinical management with pill placebo (PBO). The primary definition of remission was loss of all study-entry anxiety disorder diagnoses; additional definitions of remission were used. All outcomes were rated by independent evaluators blind to treatment assignment. Predictors of remission were also examined. Remission rates after 12 weeks of treatment ranged from 46% to 68% for COMB, 34% to 46% for SRT, 20% to 46% for CBT, and 15% to 27% for PBO. Rates of remission (i.e., achieving a nearly symptom-free state) were significantly lower than rates of response (i.e., achieving a clinically meaningful improvement relative to baseline) for the entire sample. Youth who received COMB had significantly higher rates of remission compared to all other treatment groups. Both monotherapies had higher remission rates compared to PBO, but rates were not different from each other. Predictors of remission were younger age, nonminority status, lower baseline anxiety severity, absence of other internalizing disorders (e.g., anxiety, depression), and absence of social phobia. For the majority of children, some symptoms of anxiety persisted, even among those showing improvement after 12 weeks of treatment, suggesting a need to augment or extend current treatments for some children.",911196467, Feature,2011

A Randomized Controlled Trial of Online Versus Clinic-Based CBT for Adolescent Anxiety,"The study examined the relative efficacy of online (NET) versus clinic (CLIN) delivery of cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) in the treatment of anxiety disorders in adolescents. Participants included 115 clinically anxious adolescents aged 12 to 18 years and their parent(s). Adolescents were randomly assigned to NET, CLIN, or wait list control (WLC) conditions. The treatment groups received equivalent CBT content. Clinical diagnostic interviews and questionnaire assessments were completed 12 weeks after baseline and at 6- and 12-month follow-ups. Assessment at 12 weeks post-baseline showed significantly greater reductions in anxiety diagnoses and anxiety symptoms for both NET and CLIN conditions compared with the WLC. These improvements were maintained or further enhanced for both conditions, with minimal differences between them, at 6- and 12-month follow-ups. Seventy-eight percent of adolescents in the NET group (completer sample) no longer met criteria for the principal anxiety diagnosis at 12-month follow-up compared with 80.6% in the CLIN group. Ratings of treatment credibility from both parents and adolescents were high for NET and equivalent to CLIN. Satisfaction ratings by adolescents were equivalent for NET and CLIN conditions, whereas parents indicated slightly higher satisfaction ratings for the CLIN format. Online delivery of CBT, with minimal therapist support, is equally efficacious as clinic-based, face-to-face therapy in the treatment of anxiety disorders among adolescents. This approach offers a credible alternative to clinic-based therapy, with benefits of reduced therapist time and greater accessibility for families who have difficulty accessing clinic-based CBT.",903212623, Feature,2011
Effects of Transference Work in the Context of Therapeutic Alliance and Quality of Object Relations,"Transference interpretation is considered as a core active ingredient in dynamic psychotherapy. In common clinical theory, it is maintained that more mature relationships, as well as a strong therapeutic alliance, may be prerequisites for successful transference work. In this study, the interaction between quality of object relations, transference interpretation, and alliance is estimated. One hundred outpatients seeking psychotherapy for depression, anxiety, and personality disorders were randomly assigned to 1 year of weekly sessions of dynamic psychotherapy with transference interpretation or to the same type and duration of treatment, but without the use of transference interpretation. Quality of Object Relations (QOR)-lifelong pattern was evaluated before treatment (P. Hoglend, 1994). The Working Alliance Inventory (A. O. Horvath &amp; L. S. Greenberg, 1989; T. J. Tracey &amp; A. M. Kokotovic, 1989) was rated in Session 7. The primary outcome variable was the Psychodynamic Functioning Scales (P. Hoglend et al., 2000), measured at pretreatment, posttreatment, and 1 year after treatment termination. A significant Treatment Group x Quality of Object Relations x Alliance interaction was present, indicating that alliance had a significantly different impact on effects of transference interpretation, depending on the level of QOR. The impact of transference interpretation on psychodynamic functioning was more positive within the context of a weak therapeutic alliance for patients with low quality of object relations. For patients with more mature object relations and high alliance, the authors observed a negative effect of transference work. The specific effects of transference work was influenced by the interaction of object relations and alliance, but in the direct opposite direction of what is generally maintained in mainstream clinical theory.",903212282, Feature,2011
Marriage as a Risk Factor for Internalizing Disorders: Clarifying Scope and Specificity,"Marital discord has been linked to both depression and anxiety; however, our understanding of how marriage contributes to the development of internalizing symptoms is limited in scope and lacking specificity. First, it is unclear whether the marital relationship contributes to the broad dimension of internalizing symptoms as opposed to specific diagnoses. Second, it is unclear how the marital relationship contributes to internalizing symptoms: through global marital dissatisfaction or through specific relationship processes (and which processes). The purpose of the present study was to address these 2 issues and, more generally, to develop a comprehensive and refined framework within which to understand the role of marriage in the developmental course of internalizing symptoms. Questionnaire and interview data were collected from 102 husbands and wives 5 times over the first 7 years of marriage. Results indicated that marital discord during the transition into marriage was associated with the broad dimension of internalizing symptoms for husbands but not for wives. Further, both global marital dissatisfaction and an imbalance of power and control put husbands at significant risk for symptoms over the first 7 years of marriage, whereas low levels of emotional intimacy put wives at significant risk. Results exemplify the need to routinely consider intimate relationship processes in etiological models of depression and anxiety and to identify specific clinical targets that can be prioritized in interventions aimed at preventing internalizing disorders.",903208721, Feature,2011

Seventy-eight percent of adolescents in the NET group (completer sample) no longer met criteria for the principal anxiety diagnosis at 12-month follow-up compared with 80.6% in the CLIN group. Ratings of treatment credibility from both parents and adolescents were high for NET and equivalent to CLIN. Satisfaction ratings by adolescents were equivalent for NET and CLIN conditions, whereas parents indicated slightly higher satisfaction ratings for the CLIN format. Conclusions: Online delivery of CBT, with minimal therapist support, is equally efficacious as clinic-based, face-to-face therapy in the treatment of anxiety disorders among adolescents. This approach offers a credible alternative to clinic-based therapy, with benefits of reduced therapist time and greater accessibility for families who have difficulty accessing clinic-based CBT.

Marriage as a risk factor for internalizing disorders: Clarifying scope and specificity.,"Objective: Marital discord has been linked to both depression and anxiety; however, our understanding of how marriage contributes to the development of internalizing symptoms is limited in scope and lacking specificity. First, it is unclear whether the marital relationship contributes to the broad dimension of internalizing symptoms as opposed to specific diagnoses. Second, it is unclear how the marital relationship contributes to internalizing symptoms: through global marital dissatisfaction or through specific relationship processes (and which processes). The purpose of the present study was to address these 2 issues and, more generally, to develop a comprehensive and refined framework within which to understand the role of marriage in the developmental course of internalizing symptoms. Method: Questionnaire and interview data were collected from 102 husbands and wives 5 times over the first 7 years of marriage. Results: Results indicated that marital discord during the transition into marriage was associated with the broad dimension of internalizing symptoms for husbands but not for wives. Further, both global marital dissatisfaction and an imbalance of power and control put husbands at significant risk for symptoms over the first 7 years of marriage, whereas low levels of emotional intimacy put wives at significant risk. Conclusions: Results exemplify the need to routinely consider intimate relationship processes in etiological models of depression and anxiety and to identify specific clinical targets that can be prioritized in interventions aimed at preventing internalizing disorders.

Effects of transference work in the context of therapeutic alliance and quality of object relations.,"Objective: Transference interpretation is considered as a core active ingredient in dynamic psychotherapy. In common clinical theory, it is maintained that more mature relationships, as well as a strong therapeutic alliance, may be prerequisites for successful transference work. In this study, the interaction between quality of object relations, transference interpretation, and alliance is estimated. Method: One hundred outpatients seeking psychotherapy for depression, anxiety, and personality disorders were randomly assigned to 1 year of weekly sessions of dynamic psychotherapy with transference interpretation or to the same type and duration of treatment, but without the use of transference interpretation. Quality of Object Relations (QOR)-lifelong pattern was evaluated before treatment (P. Hglend, 1994). The Working Alliance Inventory (A. O. Horvath & L. S. Greenberg, 1989; T. J. Tracey & A. M. Kokotovic, 1989) was rated in Session 7. The primary outcome variable was the Psychodynamic Functioning Scales (P. Hglend et al., 2000), measured at pretreatment, posttreatment, and 1 year after treatment termination. Results: A significant Treatment Group x Quality of Object Relations x Alliance interaction was present, indicating that alliance had a significantly different impact on effects of transference interpretation, depending on the level of QOR. The impact of transference interpretation on psychodynamic functioning was more positive within the context of a weak therapeutic alliance for patients with low quality of object relations. For patients with more mature object relations and high alliance, the authors observed a negative effect of transference work. Conclusion: The specific effects of transference work was influenced by the interaction of object relations and alliance, but in the direct opposite direction of what is generally maintained in mainstream clinical theory.

Predictors of Response to an Attention Modification Program in Generalized Social Phobia,"At least 3 randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind studies have supported the efficacy of computerized attention modification programs (AMPs) in reducing symptoms of anxiety in patients diagnosed with an anxiety disorder. In this study we examined patient characteristics that predicted response to AMP in a large sample of individuals diagnosed with generalized social phobia. The sample comprised 112 individuals seeking treatment for generalized social phobia who completed a randomized clinical trial comparing AMP (n = 55) with a placebo condition (i.e., attention control condition; n = 57). We examined the following domains of baseline predictors of treatment response: (a) demographic characteristics (gender, age, ethnicity, years of education); (b) clinical characteristics (Axis I comorbidity, trait anxiety, depression); and (c) cognitive disturbance factors (attentional bias for social threat, social interpretation bias). Results revealed that ethnicity predicted treatment response across both conditions: Participants who self-identified as non-Caucasian displayed better overall response than did Caucasians. The only prescriptive variable to emerge was attentional bias for social threat at preassessment. Participants in the AMP group who exhibited larger attentional bias scores displayed significantly greater reductions in clinician-rated social anxiety symptoms than did their counterparts in the attention control condition. These results suggest that AMP may be targeted to individuals most likely to benefit from these programs.",887792057, Feature,2011
Family Group Cognitive-Behavioral Preventive Intervention for Families of Depressed Parents: 18- and 24-Month Outcomes,"In a long-term follow-up of a randomized controlled trial (Compas et al., 2009) to examine the effects at 18- and 24-month follow-ups of a family group cognitive-behavioral (FGCB) preventive intervention for mental health outcomes for children and parents from families (N = 111) of parents with a history of major depressive disorder (MDD). Parents with a history of MDD and their 9- to 15-year-old children were randomly assigned to a FGCB intervention or a written information comparison condition. Children's internalizing, externalizing, anxiety/depression, and depressive symptoms; episodes of MDD and other psychiatric diagnoses; and parents' depressive symptoms and episodes of MDD were assessed at 18 and 24 months after randomization. Children in the FGCB condition were significantly lower in self-reports of anxiety/depression and internalizing symptoms at 18 months and were significantly lower in self-reports of externalizing symptoms at 18 and 24 months. Rates of MDD were significantly lower for children in the FGCB intervention over the 24-month follow-up (odds ratio = 2.91). Marginal effects were found for parents' symptoms of depression at 18 and 24 months but not for episodes of MDD. Support was found for a FGCB preventive intervention for children of parents with a history of MDD significantly reducing children's episodes of MDD over a period of 2 years. Significant effects for the FGCB intervention were also found on internalizing and externalizing symptoms, with stronger effects at 18- than at 24-month follow-up.",887788957, Feature,2011
Do Treatment Manuals Undermine Youth-Therapist Alliance in Community Clinical Practice?,"Some critics of treatment manuals have argued that their use may undermine the quality of the client-therapist alliance. This notion was tested in the context of youth psychotherapy delivered by therapists in community clinics. Seventy-six clinically referred youths (57% female, age 8-15 years, 34% Caucasian) were randomly assigned to receive nonmanualized usual care or manual-guided treatment to address anxiety or depressive disorders. Treatment was provided in community clinics by clinic therapists randomly assigned to treatment condition. Youth-therapist alliance was measured with the Therapy Process Observational Coding System-Alliance (TPOCS-A) scale at 4 points throughout treatment and with the youth report Therapeutic Alliance Scale for Children (TASC) at the end of treatment. Youths who received manual-guided treatment had significantly higher observer-rated alliance than usual care youths early in treatment; the 2 groups converged over time, and mean observer-rated alliance did not differ by condition. Similarly, the manual-guided and usual care groups did not differ on youth report of alliance. Our findings did not support the contention that using manuals to guide treatment harms the youth-therapist alliance. In fact, use of manuals was related to a stronger alliance in the early phase of treatment.",887788903, Feature,2011

Psychological Treatment for Panic Disorder With Agoraphobia: A Randomized Controlled Trial to Examine the Role of Therapist-Guided Exposure In Situ in CBT,"Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) is a first-line treatment for panic disorder with agoraphobia (PD/AG). Nevertheless, an understanding of its mechanisms and particularly the role of therapist-guided exposure is lacking. This study was aimed to evaluate whether therapist-guided exposure in situ is associated with more pervasive and long-lasting effects than therapist-prescribed exposure in situ. A multicenter randomized controlled trial, in which 369 PD/AG patients were treated and followed up for 6 months. Patients were randomized to 2 manual-based variants of CBT (T+/T-) or a wait-list control group (WL; n = 68) and were treated twice weekly for 12 sessions. CBT variants were identical in content, structure, and length, except for implementation of exposure in situ: In the T+ variant (n = 163), therapists planned and supervised exposure in situ exercises outside the therapy room; in the T- group (n = 138), therapists planned and discussed patients' in situ exposure exercises but did not accompany them. Primary outcome measures were (a) Hamilton Anxiety Scale, (b) Clinical Global Impression, (c) number of panic attacks, and (d) agoraphobic avoidance (Mobility Inventory). For T+ and T- compared with WL, all outcome measures improved significantly with large effect sizes from baseline to post (range = -0.5 to -2.5) and from post to follow-up (range = -0.02 to -1.0). T+ improved more than T- on the Clinical Global Impression and Mobility Inventory at post and follow-up and had greater reduction in panic attacks during the follow-up period. Reduction in agoraphobic avoidance accelerated after exposure was introduced. A dose-response relation was found for Time x Frequency of Exposure and reduction in agoraphobic avoidance. Therapist-guided exposure is more effective for agoraphobic avoidance, overall functioning, and panic attacks in the follow-up period than is CBT without therapist-guided exposure. Therapist-guided exposure promotes additional therapeutic improvement -- possibly mediated by increased physical engagement in feared situations -- beyond the effects of a CBT treatment in which exposure is simply instructed.",887102386, Feature,2011
Long-Term Effects of a Personality-Targeted Intervention to Reduce Alcohol Use in Adolescents,"To examine the long-term effects of a personality-targeted intervention on drinking quantity and frequency (QF), problem drinking, and personality-specific motivations for alcohol use in early adolescence. A randomized control trial was carried out with 364 adolescents (median age 14) recruited from 13 secondary schools with elevated scores in Hopelessness, Anxiety-Sensitivity (AS), Impulsivity, and Sensation-Seeking. Participants were randomly assigned to a control no-intervention condition or a 2-session group coping skills intervention targeting 1 of 4 personality risk factors. The effects of the intervention on quantity/frequency (QF) of alcohol use, frequency of binge drinking, problem drinking, and motives were examined at 6, 12, 18, and 24 months postintervention. Intent-to-treat repeated measures analyses revealed a significant overall intervention effect in reducing problem drinking symptoms, and a Time x Intervention effect on drinking QF and binge drinking frequency. Relative to the control group, the intervention group showed significantly reduced drinking and binge drinking levels at 6 months postintervention and reduced problem drinking symptoms for the full 24-month follow-up period (Cohen's d = 0.33). A significant Time x Intervention x Personality interaction was demonstrated for coping and enhancement drinking motives. In addition to an overall effect of intervention on coping motives, the AS group who received that intervention reported fewer coping motives compared with the AS control group at 12 and 24 months postintervention. This study provides further evidence showing that personality-targeted interventions reduce drinking behavior in adolescents in the short term. Novel findings were that the interventions were shown to produced long-term effects on drinking problems and personality-specific effects on drinking motives.",887102272, Feature,2011

Cancer Patients With Major Depressive Disorder: Testing a Biobehavioral/Cognitive Behavior Intervention,"In this Phase II trial, we evaluated a novel psychological treatment for depressed patients coping with the stresses of cancer. Effectiveness of a combined biobehavioral intervention (BBI) and cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) was studied. Participants were 36 cancer survivors (mean age = 49 years; 88% Caucasian; 92% female) diagnosed with major depressive disorder. A single group pre-post design was used. Treatment consisted of up to 20 individual 75-min combined BBI/CBT sessions. Outcomes were change in interviewer (Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression; Williams, 1988) and self-rated depressive symptoms (Beck Depression Inventory -- Second Edition; Beck, Steer, &amp; Brown, 1996) as well as change in cancer relevant symptoms (Fatigue Symptom Inventory [Hann et al., 1998] and Brief Pain Questionnaire [Daut, Cleeland, &amp; Flanery, 1983]) and quality of life (Medical Outcomes Study Short Form - 36; Ware et al., 1995). Mixed-effects modeling, a reliability change index, and generalized linear models were used. All analyses were intent-to-treat. Depressive symptoms significantly improved. In addition, 19 of 21 study completers met criteria for remission. Significant improvements were also noted in fatigue and mental health quality of life. Both concurrent anxiety disorders and high levels of cancer stress (Impact of Events Scale; Horowitz, Wilner, &amp; Alvarez, 1979) were each associated with beginning and concluding treatment with greater depressive symptoms.

Pilot Trial of a Disclosure Intervention for HIV+ Mothers: The TRACK Program,"The Teaching, Raising, And Communicating with Kids (TRACK) program was a longitudinal pilot-trial intervention designed to assist mothers living with HIV (MLHs) to disclose their serostatus to their young children (age 6-12 years). MLH and child dyads (N = 80 dyads) were recruited and randomized to intervention or control; the intervention group had 3 individual sessions and 1 follow-up phone call. The sessions focused on preparing MLHs for disclosure through behavioral exercises using Derlega's model (V. J. Derlega, B. A. Winstead, K. Greene, J. Serovich, &amp; W. N.

Both MLHs and their child were assessed across multiple time points (baseline, 3, 6, and 9 months) regarding disclosure of HIV status, and specific outcome variables (i.e., relationship context, mother's health, child's mental health, and family outcomes). MLHs in the intervention group were 6 times more likely to disclose their HIV status than those in the control group (OR = 6.33, 95% CI [1.64, 24.45]), with 33% disclosing in the intervention group compared with 7.3% in the control group.

Making Self-Help More Helpful: A Randomized Controlled Trial of the Impact of Augmenting Self-Help Materials With Implementation Intentions on Promoting the Effective Self-Management of Anxiety Symptoms,"Objective: The effectiveness of self-help materials may be constrained by failures to undertake recommended exercises or to deploy the techniques that one has learned at the critical moment. The present randomized controlled trial investigated whether augmenting self-help materials with if-then plans (or implementation intentions) could overcome these problems and enhance the self-management of anxiety symptoms. Method: At baseline, participants who reported anxiety symptoms completed the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) and the state version of the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI). Participants were then randomized via a computer program to standard self-help (n = 86), augmented self-help (n = 90), or no-intervention (n = 86) conditions. Eight weeks later, 95% (n = 249) of the participants completed the HADS and STAI again. Results: Findings showed a significant reduction in anxiety in the augmented self-help condition compared with both the standard self-help and no-intervention conditions (caseness rates on the HADS at follow-up were 21%, 49%, and 44%, respectively). Mediation analyses indicated that the benefits of augmented self-help materials were explained by improved detection of anxiety-related triggers and greater experienced benefits of the self-help techniques. Conclusions: These findings suggest that implementation intentions offer a valuable supplement to self-help materials that can enhance their impact on outcomes.

Gender Differences in Emotional Risk for Self- and Other-Directed Violence Among Externalizing Adults,"Objective: Women and men generally differ in how frequently they engage in other- and self-directed physical violence and may show distinct emotional risk factors for engagement in these high-impact behaviors. To inform this area, we investigated gender differences in the relationship of emotional tendencies (i.e., anger, hostility, and anhedonic depression) that may represent risk for other-directed violence (i.e., physical fighting, attacking others unprovoked) and self-directed violence (i.e., self-injury, suicide attempts). Method: The ethnically diverse sample consisted of 372 adults (252 men and 120 women age 18-55) with a history of criminal convictions. Facets of emotional risk assessed with the Aggression Questionnaire (Buss & Warren, 2000) and Mood and Anxiety Symptom Questionnaire (Watson et al., 1995) were entered simultaneously as explanatory variables in regression analyses to investigate their unique contributions to other- and self-directed physical violence in men and women. Results: Analyses revealed that anhedonic depressive tendencies negatively predicted other-directed violence and positively predicted self-directed violence in men and women, consistent with a model of depression in which aggression is turned inward (Henriksson et al., 1993). Gender differences, however, emerged for the differential contributions of anger and hostility to other- and self-directed violence. Trait anger (i.e., difficulty controlling one's temper) was associated with other-directed violence selectively in men, whereas trait hostility (i.e., suspiciousness and alienation) was associated with self- and other-directed violence among women. Conclusions: The divergent findings for trait anger and hostility underscore the need to examine gender-specific risk factors for physical violence to avoid excluding potentially useful clinical features of these mental health outcomes.

Making Self-Help More Helpful: A Randomized Controlled Trial of the Impact of Augmenting Self-Help Materials With Implementation Intentions on Promoting the Effective Self-Management of Anxiety Symptoms,"The effectiveness of self-help materials may be constrained by failures to undertake recommended exercises or to deploy the techniques that one has learned at the critical moment. The present randomized controlled trial investigated whether augmenting self-help materials with if-then plans (or implementation intentions) could overcome these problems and enhance the self-management of anxiety symptoms. At baseline, participants who reported anxiety symptoms completed the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) and the state version of the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI). Participants were then randomized via a computer program to standard self-help (n = 86), augmented self-help (n = 90), or no-intervention (n = 86) conditions. Eight weeks later, 95% (n = 249) of the participants completed the HADS and STAI again. Findings showed a significant reduction in anxiety in the augmented self-help condition compared with both the standard self-help and no-intervention conditions (caseness rates on the HADS at follow-up were 21%, 49%, and 44%, respectively). Mediation analyses indicated that the benefits of augmented self-help materials were explained by improved detection of anxiety-related triggers and greater experienced benefits of the self-help techniques.
